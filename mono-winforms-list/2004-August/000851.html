</I>
This is good news. 

Please, when doing your code take into account the following
considerations:

- In the cvs module winforms (cvs co winforms) there is a listbox
directory that contains a good example of using forms, that may help.
Run it on Win32 to see how it behaves.

- You will need also to implement System.Windows.Forms.ListControl, that
abstracts common functionality for ComboBox and ListBox.

- The new managed Windows.Forms implementation lives in /class/Managed.
Windows.Forms. Please, update your local CVS copy and have a look to see
how we are implementing it, specially the controls.

- Use double buffering for drawing. Have a look to the TrackBar control
for example. See how we create the buffer in OnHandleCreated and we
recreated at OnResize when the size changes and how we draw the result
on OnPaint.

- Try to follow the code style guidelines described at  mcs/README

- We only will accept controls that we are fully implemented. Make sure
that you are implementing the complete ListBox control. See Microsoft
MSDN documentation for a full description of the methods, properties,
and events. If you are missing functionality at Control.cs to implement
this control, let us know.

- Since SWF abstracts the Win32 API, if you have doubts of how certain
situation is handle in Windows you can look into the Wine open source
project source code. See <A HREF="http://www.winehq.com/.">http://www.winehq.com/.</A> 


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you have any roadmap? I just wonder when we'll be able to enjoy SWF :D
</I>
We are working on it. From now, you will see daily enhancements to the
Managed.Windows.Forms implementation, please keep your copy update it.
We expect to have some controls fully implemented for the end of the
month and an important part of the underlying infrastructure quite
complete.

Please, let us know if you have any questions.

Best Regards,

Jordi,
