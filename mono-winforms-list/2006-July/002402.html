</I>Well this is more interesting for distributions that already have a usable version installed.
Although, it is reasonable to not want to support it.  Maybe the option
can be enabled with a warning that it is not supported and of course
defaults to the internal version?  If not I'll just keep mine locally,
no big deal.

</I>Not really, I just wanted to avoid having to build an old version of
cairo when I already have a newer one installed (in addition to see if
any old/internal API was being used).  But that is great to hear.
