<PRE>  The release notes for 1.1.16 states:
   
  &#147;Repaint logic changed: Instead of having paint events that are contained in the queue and make their way to the head of the queue, we now only generate synthetic paint events for dirty windows once the queue is empty. This matches MS behavior and allows for a more responsive UI if lots of activity (or slow drawing) happens.&#148;
   
  Can someone give me a short explanation of that to me?
  I assume it means something like if there are more than one paint event in the que, you try to combine them together if possible.
   
  I need to explain this to the readers of my &#147;Monkey Business&#148; column, and want to get it right.
   
  Thanks,
  Dennis
