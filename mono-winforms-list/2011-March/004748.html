<PRE>Hi Shivansh,

We can't tell you what you should do based on your skills. You need to
decide what you want to do and write a proposal telling us what you're
doing to do. If you need more information on the ideas that are listed
on our project page, you should ask them specifically. To ask good
questions, you need to think about the project and have an idea of the
technologies envolved, and decide which parts you understand and which
parts you don't understand.

For anything regarding Monodevelop, you should start looking at how to
create addins and extend Monodevelop. For that, you need to get the
source and figure out how it works, follow relevant tutorials, etc.
You don't have to be an expert, but you should at least be able to
know how to build an addin.

I short, you need to do a bit of research on your own.

</I>&gt;<i> Respected Sir/Ma'am,
</I>&gt;<i> I have a couple of questions related to pursuing a project under your
</I>&gt;<i> organization:-
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. Can I send you my skill sets to you before the actual starting of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deadline, so that you could review it beforehand &amp; tell me specifically if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be of any help.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess sharing your skills and past works here might be sufficient.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. I have spent a lot of time in learning/gathering knowledge till now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hence, I feel it is time that I develop my skill sets by working on Real
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> World Projects.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My experience/Interests:-
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. Good programming skills in C,C++,C#,JAVA.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. &#160;I have also worked on websites, &amp; have a good amount of knowledge in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> JQuery, JavaScripts, CSS, XML/HTML, AJAX, Flash based websites.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. I have worked on Windows Phone 7 mobile OS platform &amp; developed many
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> apps/games for the same. Since it is not open source, I have sourced it in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my college, with a lot of positive feedbacks from the college students.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4. I have worked on a full 3-D Car racing game as part of my on-college
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> project. As a result I had to start right from scratch, ie, creating a car
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in MAYA, rendering it using DirectX &amp; then converting it into an fbx
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> object
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so as to use it in a Windows-based game which works on XNA 3.1 framework.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am very much interested in the Application Development of Axiom 3D
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Engine.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Kindly tell me whether I would be helpful in such a project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Goto Axiom site, check features feature wish list, todo list, engage
</I>&gt;<i> in forum and play with the engine, so that you will have better idea
</I>&gt;<i> what should be your plan for this GSoC.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, since I am behind a proxy server at my campus/college I am not able
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> connect to irc.gnome.org &amp; cant find your channels on freenode.net.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Kindly tell me how to proceed with the App development of Axiom 3D Engine.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hoping for a favourable reply.
