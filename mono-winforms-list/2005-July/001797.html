<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Slowness of MWF drawing comes from Cairo. MWF uses libgdiplus for drawing,
</I>&gt;<i> libgdiplus uses cairo/libpixmain backends for drawing and uses version
</I>&gt;<i> 0.3.0 of Cairo. Currently Cairo is version 0.5.2. The problem is that
</I>&gt;<i> Cairo isn't yet stable project as API is changed even on minor version
</I>&gt;<i> change. On mailing lists of Cairo there is talk of soon releasing of
</I>&gt;<i> version 1 which means freezing the API. But 'soon' could be month or year
</I>&gt;<i> by my opinion. 
</I>
Although Cairo is known to be a part of the problem, another part of the
equation might be the event loop processing.  

I do not remember the details, but Gtk+ spent quite a bit of time
dealing with improving their main loop and event processing to improve
performance.

Miguel.
</PRE>
