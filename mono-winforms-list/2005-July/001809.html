<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> svn <A HREF="ssh://miguel@mono-cvs.ximian.com/source/branches/libgdiplus-cairo-upgrade/">ssh://miguel@mono-cvs.ximian.com/source/branches/libgdiplus-cairo-upgrade/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     So far all that has happened there is that Cairo/Pixman have been
</I>&gt;<i> upgraded and they should build inplace.  What needs to happen now is:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         * Ensure that all of local changes to Cairo are applied back.
</I>
I've been studying what we previously addedto Cairo, here's what I noticed.

1- cairo_font.c:
 a- pthread_mutex_lock / unlock functions were added, now Cairo has
them by default.
 b- general note: function names slightly changed now (0.4 -&gt; 0.5)

2- cairo-xlib-surface.c:
 a- Same as (1, a). They are also implemented now.

3- cairo-ft-font.c:
 a- CAIRO_STATUS_NO_MEMORY checks we have added are now implemented.
 b- Locking code for global font cache was added by us, now implemented.

4- cairo-features.h:
 a- We completely removed this from Cairo, and removed it from
Makefile.am (do we still need to do this?)

In short, all our changes to Cairo have been implemented in the latest
(2005.07.27) CVS release of Cairo, so we should have no problems with
it. Our main concern, thread safe font locking, is already integrated.

Does anyone have comments regarding this?

&gt;<i>         * Start the porting effort (Hisham has a patch, but its know to
</I>&gt;<i>           fail, Hisham can you post it?)
</I>
I will, I'm just going to review it a bit.
