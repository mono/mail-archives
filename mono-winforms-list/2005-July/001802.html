<PRE>Thank you for explaining this. I'm (slowly) finding my way ;-). My first
choice is obviously to support only one GUI framework in my code, so I'll
stick to MWF and see how things pan out.

Thanks again
Pete.

</I>&gt;<i> [...testcode explanation...]
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the snippet, I will play and report back later.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;With regards to Mac, I know very little about X11 (as with 
</I>&gt;<i> Linux). To 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;be honest, I don't even understand your question ;-). When trying to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;get MWF and gtk-sharp running I saw on the mailing lists 
</I>&gt;<i> that X11 needs 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;to be installed, so I did that. I also tried to run 
</I>&gt;<i> 'mono.exe' from an 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;X11 terminal (I don't know how this differs from a normal 
</I>&gt;<i> terminal on Mac).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;After macpack I've managed to get a MWF app displaying for 
</I>&gt;<i> an instant 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;before quitting, so my success has been limited so far. 
</I>&gt;<i> However, all of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;my non-gui code is running without problems under Mono on OS 
</I>&gt;<i> X, albeit 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;at approximately half the speed of Mono on Linux (FC 4), on the same 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;PowerPC hardware.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Quick and dirty intro:
</I>&gt;<i> MWF is implemented around the concept of a 'driver'. The 
</I>&gt;<i> driver provides an abstraction layer for different windowing 
</I>&gt;<i> systems, to allow the same MWF controls to run unchanged on 
</I>&gt;<i> Win32, X11 OS X or any other desktop/window system. (Drawing 
</I>&gt;<i> is handled by System.Drawing, not the driver.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Today we have three drivers, Win32 (maintained by myself), 
</I>&gt;<i> X11 (maintained by Jackson and myself) and OS X (maintained 
</I>&gt;<i> by a non-Novell contributor, Geoff Norton). We keep Win32 and 
</I>&gt;<i> X11 en par, but due to our complete and utter lack of Mac 
</I>&gt;<i> know-how, we cannot do the same with the OS X driver, we are 
</I>&gt;<i> (until we find some time to learn Mac or it becomes a 
</I>&gt;<i> business priority) dependent on community contributions to 
</I>&gt;<i> it. The Mac driver currently does not provide keyboard 
</I>&gt;<i> handling, and has some issues with drawing and exposures.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the Mac, you can use either the X11 driver (and draw 
</I>&gt;<i> through the Mac X11
</I>&gt;<i> server) or the OS X driver (which draws via native Carbon). 
</I>&gt;<i> You are correct, today X11 is required on the Mac even for 
</I>&gt;<i> the native driver, due to some font handling requirements.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you run the app via macpack, you are using the OS X 
</I>&gt;<i> driver, not the X11 driver. Running from a X11 terminal 
</I>&gt;<i> should a) work and b) use the X11 driver. Remember, I'm not a 
</I>&gt;<i> mac guy, though.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>   Peter
</I>&gt;<i>
