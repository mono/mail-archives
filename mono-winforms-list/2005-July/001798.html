<PRE>That would make sense. It almost appears as if the MWF event loop is clocked
at a fixed frequency, resulting in the (almost) fixed frame rate regardless
of architecture or video drivers. Of course it will be more complex than
that, but it does appear that the delay is at least in part due to the event
loop.

What would be the best way to proceed though? In the last few days I have
tried gtk-sharp on Mac without much success, having had a lot of trouble
installing gtk-sharp under PowerPC (at least with Mono 1.1.8 and FC4). I saw
the post by Attila Balogh who provides a modified Mono framework for OS X
Tiger (90MB), which includes gtk-sharp 1.0.10, but I haven't tried it yet. I
thought I'd hold out for a while and keep testing on Linux (Intel/PPC) using
MWF. I've also had a look at wx.Net but it appears that gtk-sharp is more
widely supported. In a perfect world I would use MWF since this requires no
change from my .NET code, but failing that, I was hoping to use a single GUI
toolkit for both Linux and OS X. Does gtk-sharp fit the bill?

Pete.

</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Slowness of MWF drawing comes from Cairo. MWF uses libgdiplus for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; drawing, libgdiplus uses cairo/libpixmain backends for drawing and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; uses version 0.3.0 of Cairo. Currently Cairo is version 0.5.2. The 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem is that Cairo isn't yet stable project as API is 
</I>&gt;<i> changed even 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on minor version change. On mailing lists of Cairo there is talk of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; soon releasing of version 1 which means freezing the API. 
</I>&gt;<i> But 'soon' 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could be month or year by my opinion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Although Cairo is known to be a part of the problem, another 
</I>&gt;<i> part of the equation might be the event loop processing.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do not remember the details, but Gtk+ spent quite a bit of 
</I>&gt;<i> time dealing with improving their main loop and event 
</I>&gt;<i> processing to improve performance.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Miguel.
