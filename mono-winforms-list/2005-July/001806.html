<PRE>&gt;<i>should we expect MWF to run almost as fast as SWF when it'll use cairo 
</I>&gt;<i>0.5.0
</I>&gt;<i>or will it need more work or even worst, will it never be as fast as SWF?
</I>I will answer you once we run with cairo 0.5.0.
Also, you need to understand that switching to a newer version of cairo is 
not a magic bullet. And there always is more work to be done, Cairo is only 
version 0.5, and they're just beginning to look into optimizations. We 
haven't looked at optimizations at all in MWF or System.Drawing. We need to 
finish code first. Of course speed was a consideration when writing 
controls, but you can't spend a month optimizing when writing the controls, 
or it'll never get done.

&gt;<i>Actually we have many layers and it makes wondering if memory won't be used
</I>&gt;<i>too much, this may seem a &quot;stupid worry&quot; but then I would just give you 
</I>&gt;<i>this
</I>&gt;<i>link:

</I>&gt;<i>It would also be interesting to compare the same app run with MS.NET and
</I>&gt;<i>Mono but it's behind the scope of this MWF list.
</I>That's not something I'm too worried about at this point. But we will look 
at memory usage in the future, it is important. As for layers, depending on 
how you count, we only have one or two more than MS (one with cairo, and twi 
if you count the Xserver)

Don't get your undies in a bunch just yet :-)

Cheers,
  Peter
