<PRE>I assume you mean the performance on platforms other than windows? (as
mono on Windows uses the actual MS gdiplus library; it's performance is
fine, and its as fast as it will get).
	On other platforms mono is using Cairo. Cairo is still in
development (0.5 I believe). The maintainers are working on stabilizing
the API and behavior before they look into performance.
	The performance isn't great right now, but it's not horrible.
Make sure you are drawing as efficiently as possible (double buffering,
invalidate only the changed area, etc.). Other than that, it will just
take time.
	In regards to theming (assuming you mean a theme other than
Win32, such as GTK)? The theming infrastructure exists in mono winforms
today, but the only one actively developed on is Win32. GTK was started,
but I believe it has fallen by the wayside. Feel free to implement items
in the GTK theme to match there Win32 counterparts (ThemeGtk.cs).

Subject: [Mono-winforms-list] Drawing performance

Hi again,
hope found the right mailing list for that question. But the drawing
performance is so terrable ( and so buggy )? Will soon get stabilze ?
What
can be done for helping it and what could be done for get theming
support
?
