<PRE>&gt;<i>From what you are saying it appears that I should have separate GUI code
</I>which uses Glade for Linux / OS X instead of WMF. Our software is scheduled
for release in the first half of next year and it sounds as if it will be a
while still before Cairo is fast and stable. Not really what I was hoping to
hear ;-) but thanks for the info.

Pete.

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Re: [Mono-winforms-list] MWF painting VERY slow 
</I>&gt;<i> compared to .NET
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When painting a bitmap to a Form and measuring the frame 
</I>&gt;<i> rate, I get 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; vastly different figures on .NET vs. Mono. E.g. on .NET I 
</I>&gt;<i> get 114 fps 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; while under mono it's only 4.5 fps (on the same hardware). 
</I>&gt;<i> What's even 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stranger is that I get the same (4.5 fps) figure on a 
</I>&gt;<i> PowerPC Mac mini 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (1.42 GHz G4, 167MHz
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bus) and an Intel box (dual 3GHz Xeon, 533MHz bus). Both 
</I>&gt;<i> systems are 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; running Fedora Core 4. I thought that perhaps it relates to video 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; drivers but I installed the latest ATI driver on my Xeon 
</I>&gt;<i> box (Radeon 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 9800 Pro) and there is still no difference.
</I>&gt;<i> if you have searched the mailing list would known that 
</I>&gt;<i> drawing issues are it's known problem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Something else is that on WMF, the background is always 
</I>&gt;<i> painted even 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; though I override OnPaintBackground of my Form with an empty 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implementation,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; e.g.:
</I>&gt;<i> nasty nasty bugs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; protected override void OnPaintBackground(PaintEventArgs e) { }
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On Windows, this prevents the Form from repainting the background, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thus speeding up painting and reducing flicker, while MWF always 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; appears to repaint the background.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've done (very limited) testing on Gtk (Glade), and it 
</I>&gt;<i> appears to be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fast on Linux (comparable to System.Windows.Forms on .NET), 
</I>&gt;<i> but while 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; being fast on Linux, Glade is MUCH slower on Windows (I don't have 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exact figures but it's very noticable).
</I>&gt;<i> Glade uses GDK for drawing, while Winforms uses Cairo
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is the MWF implementation likely to increase in speed (by 
</I>&gt;<i> 20 times!) 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as it matures, or should I use Gtk for Linux / OS X and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; System.Windows.Forms for Windows? I was hoping that I could use a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; single code base for all platforms (which has been the case so far).
</I>&gt;<i> I hope that too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Don't take this the wrong way, I don't mean to be critical. I think 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it's great that there is a managed implementation of Windows Forms, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but at 20 times slower it renders my Windows applications 
</I>&gt;<i> unusable under Mono.
</I>&gt;<i> Slowness of MWF drawing comes from Cairo. MWF uses libgdiplus 
</I>&gt;<i> for drawing, libgdiplus uses cairo/libpixmain backends for 
</I>&gt;<i> drawing and uses version 0.3.0 of Cairo. Currently Cairo is 
</I>&gt;<i> version 0.5.2. The problem is that Cairo isn't yet stable 
</I>&gt;<i> project as API is changed even on minor version change. On 
</I>&gt;<i> mailing lists of Cairo there is talk of soon releasing of 
</I>&gt;<i> version 1 which means freezing the API. But 'soon' could be 
</I>&gt;<i> month or year by my opinion. Hower I am interested ( as seems 
</I>&gt;<i> as you) in mature MWF applications - so I 've started porting 
</I>&gt;<i> libgdi to current cairo and expect big difference in 
</I>&gt;<i> performance - if you interested in helping me - tell me. If 
</I>&gt;<i> you not there are other issues for MWF which should be done: 
</I>&gt;<i> theming, icons and others - ask the core developers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Vl. Moushkov
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Pete.
