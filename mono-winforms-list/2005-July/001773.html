<PRE>	If you are talking about the textbox mainly, I know that Peter
has been working on it a lot, but the control is not an easy one.
	The text 'going to garbage' and 'doubling' is a known issue I
believe. A lot of the drawing issues are of course Cairo related (I say
that not to blame them), but I would think that most/all exceptions are
due to code on our side.

Subject: RE: [Mono-winforms-list] Drawing performance

Thank you for the answear. The X11 performance is terrible, for example
editing text is totaly unusable ( no right click for copy/paster instead
the text get garbiged display ), multiple click on the text gets
throwing
exception and so on..., sometime text is doubled (offset on redrawing
??)
Its is interesting to know from where are comming the all these issues
are
they all cairo related .. ?

&gt;<i> I assume you mean the performance on platforms other than windows? (as
</I>&gt;<i> mono on Windows uses the actual MS gdiplus library; it's performance
</I>is
&gt;<i> fine, and its as fast as it will get).
</I>&gt;<i> 	On other platforms mono is using Cairo. Cairo is still in
</I>&gt;<i> development (0.5 I believe). The maintainers are working on
</I>stabilizing
&gt;<i> the API and behavior before they look into performance.
</I>&gt;<i> 	The performance isn't great right now, but it's not horrible.
</I>&gt;<i> Make sure you are drawing as efficiently as possible (double
</I>buffering,
&gt;<i> invalidate only the changed area, etc.). Other than that, it will just
</I>&gt;<i> take time.
</I>&gt;<i> 	In regards to theming (assuming you mean a theme other than
</I>&gt;<i> Win32, such as GTK)? The theming infrastructure exists in mono
</I>winforms
&gt;<i> today, but the only one actively developed on is Win32. GTK was
</I>started,
&gt;<i> but I believe it has fallen by the wayside. Feel free to implement
</I>items
&gt;<i> in the GTK theme to match there Win32 counterparts (ThemeGtk.cs).

</I>&gt;<i> Hi again,
</I>&gt;<i> hope found the right mailing list for that question. But the drawing
</I>&gt;<i> performance is so terrable ( and so buggy )? Will soon get stabilze ?
</I>&gt;<i> What
</I>&gt;<i> can be done for helping it and what could be done for get theming
</I>&gt;<i> support
</I>&gt;<i> ?
</I>&gt;<i>
