Hi All,

I am using Mono 2.4.2.3 on OpenSUSE 11.1 and SUSE Linux Enterprise 11

I have a kiosk application created with VS2008, compiled in MonoDevelop on
OpenSUSE 11.1 and then exported to the machine running SUSE and Mono.

All forms are of a fixed size taking the full aspect of the screen. Screen
resolution 800x600 and so is all form sizes.

I only have 1 issue left... and need community help.

The first form (Starting Form) of the program, thus the one that should
always be under all other forms... sometimes appears as the top-most form. 
When it does, that form is inactive (in a frozen state) and the only way to
close it is via ALT-F4.  Once it's closed, we can see the form that the user
clicked to try to open the other form. 

There is a need to open forms using ShowDialog() method. Actually i am
using, frm.Owner = this; frm.ShowDialog(this); where frm is the child form
to open depending on user action (e.g. button press). That way, there can be
10-15 forms open one after another in a hierarchy. but, as all form are
displayed using ShowDialog() method, there can be at most one direct child
form open at any given time from a parent form. Also, that child form can
open another child form too. This is how navigation goes.

When the Starting Form on-top stuck issue happens, it occurs randomly when a
user clicks and the program opens a form on top of the current form.  It
doesn't matter what is on the form loading or the form that it comes from. 
It is random, the user could be clicking very slowly, one click per minute
or 10 clicks per second, it occurs so randomly...

Anyone experience this type of behavior and have a
solution/work-around/different manner that should be used to open these
forms?

Looking forward to your replies.

Thank you.
