It's not that Wine does a better job, it's just that Mono and Wine don't have
the same goals, and don't do things the same way. Wine tries its best to act
just like Windows, while Mono uses the default OS fonts (and icons, too). So
Mono integrates better with the OS, although WinForms isn't really the best
example of that (OS integration could be improved some more, especially on
OSX, I guess).

Note that Windows users can also change their default font settings, meaning
non-flexible apps would also have a &quot;strange look&quot; in that case. So it's not
a new issue that Mono introduces, but can also happen with .NET on Windows.
