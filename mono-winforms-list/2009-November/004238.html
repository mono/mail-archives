Hello,

1) I think there's no solution for that, it's been asked before, you may
want to look around.
2) Mixing GTK# and WinForms, although more or less possible, is not a good
idea, IMO. Just pick one or the other.
3) No idea.
4) There hasn't been any Mac-specific progress that I could see (there were
some plans for Mono 2.6, but they ended up being scrapped, unfortunately).
That said, I recently discovered a parameter that makes WinForms apps behave
better on Mac. Launch your app by typing: MONO_MWF_MAC_FORCE_X11=1 mono
yourapp.exe
and see if some things behave better...
5) WinForms support for iPhone or Android isn't planned. What the Mono devs
are opting for is using wrappers around the iPhone / Android UI libs, rather
than reusing desktop API like WinForms or GTK#. This has the benefit of
really looking native, at the cost of having to write platform-specific
code.
6) Dunno.
