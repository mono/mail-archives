</I>Were you using official repositories?
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Still didn't work, so I decided to go from scratch: I downloaded mono,
</I>&gt;<i> monodevelop, gtk-sharp and other latest sources, and started building.
</I>&gt;<i> I finally got to UiaAtkBridge and then I saw some compilation errors -
</I>&gt;<i> something to do with delay-signing the library (for this I had to add
</I>&gt;<i> parameters to the compiler flags) and some classes (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> TextContainerWithGrid) implementing Table interface just weren't up to
</I>&gt;<i> date. To be precise: public int[] SelectedColumns and public int[]
</I>&gt;<i> SelectedRows properties were missing, which were apparently added to
</I>&gt;<i> the latest UiaAtkBridge.Table. After getting around these errors I was
</I>&gt;<i> able to successfully build the library and putting it in my bin
</I>&gt;<i> folder, solved my problem.
</I>Did you overwrite your packaged mono with this new installation?
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To be true I don't think I need any accessibility libraries (at least
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not using them explicitly), but my simple programs - referencing
</I>&gt;<i> System and System.Drawing - seem to load them anyway.
</I>Yes, they do, however if the libraries don't exist if won't load them,
and it shouldn't fail.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's the whole story. Now you see that I didn't do anything
</I>&gt;<i> 'special' at first, and I wouldn't have if the normal setup worked
</I>&gt;<i> fine.
