<PRE>Hi,

I first installed Mono on Ubuntu 10.4 using Synaptics - I selected what libs
I thought might be useful, et voila, it was working fine for my needs. Then,
after I upgraded to Ubuntu 10.10 the applications I wrote previously didn't
want to start, and the error appeared similar to the one in the original
post. At first I thought it was some configuration error, so I did uninstall
_everything_ even remotely related to mono and installed it back, again
using Synaptics.

Still didn't work, so I decided to go from scratch: I downloaded mono,
monodevelop, gtk-sharp and other latest sources, and started building. I
finally got to UiaAtkBridge and then I saw some compilation errors -
something to do with delay-signing the library (for this I had to add
parameters to the compiler flags) and some classes (e.g.
TextContainerWithGrid) implementing Table interface just weren't up to date.
To be precise: public int[] SelectedColumns and public int[] SelectedRows
properties were missing, which were apparently added to the latest
UiaAtkBridge.Table. After getting around these errors I was able to
successfully build the library and putting it in my bin folder, solved my
problem.

To be true I don't think I need any accessibility libraries (at least I'm
not using them explicitly), but my simple programs - referencing System and
System.Drawing - seem to load them anyway.

That's the whole story. Now you see that I didn't do anything 'special' at
first, and I wouldn't have if the normal setup worked fine.

Best regards,
Michal

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I had the same problem and I managed to work around it by downloading the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the UiaAtkBridge source code, modifying the necessary classes and
</I>&gt;<i> building
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it on my machine (Ubuntu x86).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you want, take a look here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://miszacus.net/index.php?a=uiaatkbridge">http://miszacus.net/index.php?a=uiaatkbridge</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://miszacus.net/index.php?a=uiaatkbridge">http://miszacus.net/index.php?a=uiaatkbridge</A>  - you can download the
</I>&gt;<i> library
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and the modified source code from there.
</I>&gt;<i> That shouldn't happen because loading those libraries is wrapped around
</I>&gt;<i> a try/catch, anyway, something is clearly broken.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I recall correctly UiaAtkBridge.Table was introduced in 1.0, and
</I>&gt;<i> since it's saying that this class is missing I bet you are using 0.9 or
</I>&gt;<i> lower, to fix it you could try two things:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Uninstall all &quot;uia&quot; related packages, this in case you don't need
</I>&gt;<i> accessibility.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. If you *do* need accessibility you will have to wait a little bit, we
</I>&gt;<i> are working on packaging the 2.1 packages for Ubuntu 10.04, packages for
</I>&gt;<i> other distributions[1] are already available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess this happened because you installed/mixed UI Automation versions
</I>&gt;<i> or built them from source and then you overwrote your packaged mono. If
</I>&gt;<i> you didn't do anything like that I will appreciate if you tell me where
</I>&gt;<i> you downloaded the debs, if you built them from sources or what you did
</I>&gt;<i> to get this error otherwise it will be really hard to fix.
