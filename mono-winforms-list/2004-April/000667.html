<PRE>What strikes me as even more interesting is the settlement that MS and Sun
have come to terms on regarding open lawsuits between the two.  Apparently,
a lot of cash and technical information will exhange hands to settle things.
Which, could have two interesting affects, where Java may run even better on
windows and .NET assemblies could possibly run &quot;natively&quot; via Sun offical
JVM support on non-windows OS's.  Ok, the second one is complete speculation
on my part. ;-)

Also, just my opinion, but if Microsoft couldn't/wouldn't stop the WINE guys
from replicating most of the Win32 API, then how or why could/would they
stop the replication of the .NET framework?  MS has to walk a tight line
here because they are trying to clean up their sinister repuation of being a
&quot;bad&quot; industry friendly company.  Starting lawsuits over the replication of
the .NET framework would be a &quot;bad&quot; industry move for them.  If Mono really
becomes a threat at all then I think they would more likely resort to FUD
like they have in the past, where they try and make Mono sound very unstable
and unreliable for corporate america to use.  MS is will see that the battle
against Open Source will not be won in the courtrooms(as SCO will soon show
us), but by the old fashioned way of making and marketing a superior
product.

I know, I know, these comments belong on <A HREF="mailto:mono-list@ximian.com">mono-list@ximian.com</A>, but I
couldn't help myself. :-)

What happen it Microsoft decide to change the .NET patent? This affect the
development and future of Mono?

Hello,

&gt;<i> &gt; 1. This a violation of Microsoft intelectual property. This is just 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not right and you will not help any open source project doing that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Alright, the questions seems rather stupid to me now. I was under the 
</I>&gt;<i> impression that the .NET Framework was a free package as well...
</I>
You should read the End User License Agreement that you clicked `I agree'
when you installed the framework.  

The question is answered by reading that. 

Miguel
