Just checking: when you say &quot;System.Winforms&quot;, you really mean
&quot;System.Windows.Forms&quot;, right?

Also, MonoDevelop has no WinForms designer. So I suggest you build your UI
on Windows (using Visual Studio or something else), then test your app on
Linux. The other option would be to build your app without using a designer,
which doesn't sound nice. Or use GTK# rather than WinForms, or something.

Not sure what problem you're encountering with getting the latest Mono on
OpenSUSE, it should be pretty straightforward, if you're using the official
repo from the Mono download page. There's another tool in OpenSUSE to add
repo URLs, other than zypper, but I forgot what its name is. Then when
looking for new programs / updates, you should see all Mono 2.10 packages.
