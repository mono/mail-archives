<PRE>
I just downloaded and tried this out in openSuse 11.3 (which is also new to
me).  Im familiar with C# from Visual Studio and want to make it work on
this.

In a new solution i made a button, progressbar and double clicked the button
in the ide designer view hoping it would generate a method stub for the
OnClick event, but it didnt;  I tried to manually make a delegate but it got
an error saying what is this += thing?  eventually found the on click event
and added a messagebox.show or tried to, its not known.

using system.winforms was not known.  searching got a page that said
download it from svn.anon something, so i installed subversion and tried it
svn co <A HREF="svn://anonmonoproject">svn://anonmonoproject</A> whatever? connection refused.

I installed the latest mono development from the main page using zypper.

but i couldnt find or get the trunk/mcs to build it??

So the big picture is that I want to setup the IDE to look like a windows C#
winforms platform;

2nd thing is to have these run in the suse linux
3rd thing is to create the forms as threads

thanks in advance
