Hi,
yes I meant system.windows.forms

In the monodevelop there was some kind of design page, although different
from visual studio;

Can you describe how I would build it in visual studio but then test it on
linux??  this is possible?  if I could add emphasis and excitement in a
question i would do it above.

I did get the latest monodevelop downloaded, and it showed in the details
that it was downgrading some and installing other stuff, afterwards i could
open a default project, compile, run without doing any other coding, and it
worked and displayed a blank window as expected.  the first time i ran it
got errors saying cannot find assembly this/that...then downloaded it from
the site and it worked; so thats solved.

I could NOT get the system.windows.forms add in.  but WOW!! if i can build
these in VS2008 and they work in the linux thats great.

It would be so much more helpful to hear an overview of the process rather
than try to figure it out from scratch

thanks
