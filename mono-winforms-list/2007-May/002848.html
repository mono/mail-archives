Hi Dan,

To introduce myself quickly, I am lead of a small development team of
engineering software. The application is client/server written in VB.Net and
MSSQL. I am looking at the feasibility of supporting linux and thought I
would take a look at how useable Mono is. I am a relative linux newb. I am
not really fussed about missing VB specific features in Mono because they
can be recoded easily however I have a heavy reliance on WinForms and GDI+.

I have recently installed Feisty Ubuntu and installed Mono/MonoDevelop from
the package manager on my home machine to have a play and havent got very
far.

Windows.Forms is part of a standard Mono installation. I cant see how to
reference and/or use it. 

I have been occasionally checking <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/">http://www.mono-project.com/</A> over quite a
long time. 
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/WinForms">http://www.mono-project.com/WinForms</A> provides some background info, nothing
of any use really. The development weblog it references was last updated Feb
06.
I am happy using the latest stable release so I hope I dont have to compile
my own version.

Is there a simple way of getting up and running with WinForms? Is there a
decent way to develop WinForms in Linux or would I be better off staying in
Windows and using Visual Studio (and then trying to compile under Mono and
run results on Linux)? If there are any other website with information
please point me in the right direction, I have tried the mono website,
mailing list, various blogs, Wikipedia and whatever Google has thrown up to
try and find my way.

Thanks,
Denis
