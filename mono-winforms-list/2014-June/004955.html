<PRE>Hi there,

I have a Windows Forms custom control assembly which I have authored that
does not run under Mono and I&#8217;m stuck trying to figure out why.  I have
provided a link to the testbed exe and the DLL below.  Both target Framework
2.0.  The DLL has a custom splitter, group bar, and navigation bar that I
have authored.

<A HREF="http://www.ryanrogers.com/monotest.zip">http://www.ryanrogers.com/monotest.zip</A>

I have ran both the DLL and EXE through Mono Analyzer and there were no
issues found.  Of course, I make no p/invoke calls or anything like that.

I have compiled under VS 2010 as well as Mono.  No warnings or errors
compiling with either.  I used the CSC.exe syntax out from VS and ran it
through the Mono compiler.

However, it doesn&#8217;t matter whether I run the MS-compiled assemblies of the
Mono-compiled assemblies.  In both cases I see a stack overflow warning
(when run with &#8211;verbose), and the UI never launches.

Everything runs fine using the MS runtime.

I have tried both the &#8220;latest&#8221; and &#8220;stable&#8221; builds of Mono, and get the same
result.

I&#8217;m new too Mono, but a .Net veteran.  How do I get more info out of Mono so
that I can tell what is causing the problem?  

I know it&#8217;s my NavBar / GroupBar control that is causing the issue, as when
I remove their creation from the testbed exe, it launches.  So something
these controls are doing is causing an issue, but I have no idea what, and
am not sure the best way to diagnose this using Visual Studio.  They are
quite complex controls so I need some way to diagnose this.  Do I need to be
running MonoDevelop?  Was hoping to avoid that...

Are there some log files or logging options I'm overlooking?

Any help or pointers would be most appreciated!

Thanks,
Ryan
