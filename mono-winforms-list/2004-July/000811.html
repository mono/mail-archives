I don't think this is necessary. The functionality that Wine offers is
significant enough that developers like myself and Torben (I don't
know about the Mono/SWF guys) would probably be willing to put up with
frequent API changes. But I can't do that when there is no way for me
to discover the correct prototype for wine_init() or some of the very
limited number of other internal wine functions we need to call.

Stable APIs - if you want. Accurate and useful version information -
can't live without it.

Perhaps more to the point, I didn't even know that he had done this!
