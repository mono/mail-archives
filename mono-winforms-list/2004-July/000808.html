<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i>Once again how can you fuss about unstable interfaces on a project that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>does not have a stable release? You could work with Winehq to create
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>those stable interfaces.
</I>
PDB might not be able to fuss, but I will. I recently asked about a
way to figure out which version of Wine is in use at run-time because
of the recent changes to wine_init()'s prototype. Alexandre appeared
quite adamant that he was against introducing any such mechanism.

Wine has a bit of a problem with the Mono project and our much smaller
FST project to support VST win32/x86 plugins on linux. It has
previously been a self-contained project that did not provide
libraries, and whose internal API was not accessed by anyone or
anything outside of Wine itself. It now is being used by (at least) 2
projects as a *library*, and it can either accept that role - which
implies providing (at least) runtime version info - or reject it,
which would be a great shame.
