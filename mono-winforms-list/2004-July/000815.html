<PRE>Hey,

   I agree with the portability of Wine: we can get it to run.

   The good news is that for now we can complete the toolkit, and
later, when Wine stabilizes we will reuse the work that was done in the
past in the Wine/Windows.Forms to be able to use it as a plugin for
hosting the most complicated controls (ActiveX, IE, third-party).

&gt;<i> I was there when Miguel came online to ask why the patch was not merged
</I>&gt;<i> and I also seem to recall Alexandre proposed a fix the would work and
</I>&gt;<i> seemed to make Miguel happy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> See:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.winehq.org/hypermail/wine-devel/2004/03/0150.html">http://www.winehq.org/hypermail/wine-devel/2004/03/0150.html</A>
</I>
And that is what we are using today for WineLib, but we have other
challenges: the integration between GDI+ and Wine was a hard one, and
people did have problems.

We are trying to complete Windows.Forms, and the Wine approach turned
out to be too hard.
