<PRE>Hello!

I am also giving a serious thought about proposing Infragistics to make
their control suite available on Linux. If someone wants to go further
please count on me and my company for this effort.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's great news, thank you Jackson.  Since you are looking for possible
</I>&gt;<i> quirky behavior of SWF controls, I'm thinking perhaps some test cases that
</I>&gt;<i> override the OnPaint method for persistence testing would be good.  What
</I>&gt;<i> would also be nice is to get a major control vendor, like Infragistics, to
</I>&gt;<i> assign mono a liason to do some control testing with their code.  Or maybe
</I>&gt;<i> they could give you guys a compilmentry source license for testing? ;-)
</I>If
&gt;<i> mono could eventually run the NetAdvtantage Suite that would sure be
</I>&gt;<i> impressive.  It would mean even more sales for Infragistics by opening up
</I>&gt;<i> the linux desktop to their .NET controls and a great suite of controls for
</I>&gt;<i> us developers to use.  Couldn't hurt for you guys to contact them.

</I>&gt;<i>   The new rewrite has begun but it is more of an archetictural stage right
</I>&gt;<i> now. It will be in full swing next week, and a considerable amount of
</I>effort
&gt;<i> will go into it. There will be more Novell developers working on winforms
</I>&gt;<i> then any other component of Mono. So I would expect it to be useable very
</I>&gt;<i> shortly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  I would like to help, if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can, when the WinForms folks get to point when they've got something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to show and need help with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   You can help right now by developing small test cases on windows.
</I>&gt;<i> Extremely simple forms with one or two controls that cover the gamut of a
</I>&gt;<i> controls functionality. Having these test cases written before we develop
</I>a
&gt;<i> control will save us test writing time and give us a nice blueprint for a
</I>&gt;<i> controls functionality. If you are an experienced winforms developer try
</I>to
&gt;<i> include or document any &quot;strange&quot; behavior a control may have that might
</I>not
&gt;<i> be obvious to us when we begin developing the control. Obviously larger
</I>test
&gt;<i> cases will also be useful, but a good set of small functional test cases
</I>&gt;<i> will be extremely useful when developing SWF. Short of writing test cases
</I>&gt;<i> just documenting any non obvious or poorly documented functionality would
</I>be
&gt;<i> very useful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As far as WinForms being the most important part of the project,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; while I might be _partially_ with you on that one, I'm afraid that we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; both are going to get flamed by the ASP.NET programmers out there :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd like to avoid that, if possible. So, no flames, please, I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; making any claims to that effect here. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   There is no single most important part of Mono. Mono is useful as a
</I>whole
&gt;<i> but how useful would a complete System.Windows.Forms implementation be
</I>&gt;<i> without a corlib or runtime? And besides we all know the assembler is the
</I>&gt;<i> most important part of Mono ;-).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I too, would like to run all my current WinForms projects under Mono
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on Linux, and I also have to put all of them on hold, so I'm with you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on that one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   See above pieces on test cases. Also as we progress in the
</I>implementation
&gt;<i> please test your applications on Mono as often as possible and file bug
</I>&gt;<i> reports on any regressions or incorrect functionality, no matter how
</I>&gt;<i> mundane.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the cheer-leading Mark, much appreciated, Jackson
