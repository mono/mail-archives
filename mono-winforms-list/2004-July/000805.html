You are asking for stable interfaces and those can only come once there
is a Wine 1.0. Its not here and dont get me wrong I think the Wine TODO
list is way to long and things should be close to frozen by now but
thats not the case. All you are doing is pointing out that its not
stable which is well known. I wish it was stable now but its not and
until the TODO is done its not going to be.

Thanks
Steven
