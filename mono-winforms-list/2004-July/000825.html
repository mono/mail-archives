Mono - Views from a Windows developer.

 

Ok, first some history. I have been a Windows developer for 10 years
starting with the C programming language. I then moved into VB at version 4
before progressing to VB.Net and finally to C#. During that time period I
have watched the rise of the various Linux distros with interest. I have
played around with many of them and I am a strong advocator of choice. I
have even tried the various Linux based toolkits such as Tcl, Qt and Gtk. So
I was very interested when I discovered the Mono Project. I have followed
Mono now for over a year and have ported much of my Dot Net Assemblies over
into Linux. Now comes the rub, Windows Forms. Now most programmers are
creatures of habit and like to stick with what they know and feel
comfortable with and yes I know Windows Forms is only a preview in the
latest version of Mono. 

 

I get the general feeling that those in the Linux community would like to
see us use the Gtk# toolkit and Monodevelop does not have a Windows Form
Project type. I have to say that for most of us that would mean supporting
two sets of GUI code. I can tell you right now, it will not happen.
Developers simply do not have the time to do this so Windows Forms are
crucial to the future of Mono if it wants to be a serious cross-platform
toolkit. I personally think that using Wine to do this is wrong and the
Windows Forms classes should map to native code but that is just my opinion.


 

At the end of the day if the Mono community and Linux as a whole is to
benefit from this project and expect to see many programs ported across to
Linux they must implement Windows Forms or many windows developers
anticipating an easy way to port their applications will lose interest fast.
I for one have put a few projects on hold at this point. I have tried the
preview version of Windows Forms and it cannot even successfully show a
message box without going screwy.

 

So to the mono programmers I say don't let us down on this most important
part of the project and I am sure this will be a great success. I for one
would like all my future products to work on Windows and Linux.
