<PRE>Oliver,

There is a new effort underway writing SWF in managed code. Part of that is
the concept of a 'UI driver', that is supposed to tie the SWF class library
into the native windowing system of the host OS.

To answer your specific questions:
a) Very. In fact, supporting Mac OS X is on my list of things to have for
SWF
b) Nope, other than that it's hard, I can't think of one.

As for helping out, that's great news. To get started and get an idea what's
needed, I suggest you check out the mcs module from CVS and go to
mcs/class/Managed.Windows.Forms. Check out the
System.Windows.Forms/XplatUIDriver.cs and
System.Windows.Forms/XplatUIWin32.cs files. It gives you an idea where to
start and how the driver interface is structured. We also have a theme
interface planned, to allow drawing with the look of the native OS.
The Managed SWF effort is very new, I think we've only been working on it
for 3 weeks, so it's still in very early stages and the driver interface is
still evolving, but that's probably the best time to jump in and see if what
we have will work for the Mac.

Hope this gets you started. Feel free to come back with any questions you
may have!

Cheers,
 Peter

Subject: [Mono-winforms-list] Native winforms implementation for OS X


&gt;<i>Hi all -
</I>&gt;<i>I can't seem to get to the archives for this list, so I'm not sure if
</I>&gt;<i>this has come up before: I'm interested in doing a native OS X
</I>&gt;<i>implementation of winforms, and was wondering if
</I>&gt;<i>a) would it be useful
</I>&gt;<i>and
</I>&gt;<i>b) would there be any good reason not to do it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I'm sure it would be a lot of work, but I think the possible benefits
</I>&gt;<i>would be great.  If somebody is already working on this, I'd love to
</I>&gt;<i>help out.
