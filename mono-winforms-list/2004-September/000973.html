<PRE>Can linux handle transparent and/or translucent windows ?

By transparent, I am talking about a window that can have 'holes'
By translucent, I am talking about a window that can fade in/out, blending 
with the desktop background.

Also, by translucent and transparent, I am talking about applying partial 
opacity to certain areas of the window.

Can we do that here on linux ?

I have written a new UI toolkit for my company - because I am not completely 
happy with the MS implementation of a few controls - , and among other things 
I re-wrote a complete menu class that looks like the Outlook 2003 menus, with 
shadowed border.

I have written a *lot* of user controls under c# and could contribute some of 
my experience. But if linux (or X11) doesn't handle transparency and 
translucency for a window, then it makes no sense for my to contribute here.
