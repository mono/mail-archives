<PRE>It's not even using the right System.Windows.Forms.dll . The managed version 
does not have TextBox code *at all*. Not even stubbed. You are clearly 
running the old dll.

Hi,

&gt;<i> Have you followed the instructions to build the managed windows forms
</I>&gt;<i> found here: <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/contributing/winforms.html">http://www.mono-project.com/contributing/winforms.html</A> ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By default the old System.Windows.Forms.dll is built. You need to follow
</I>&gt;<i> those instructions to build the new System.Windows.Forms.
</I>
Followed it to the letter.

This box has never had mono on and was built fresh from cvs.

I've looked in /usr/local/lib/mono and the symlink for SWF points
to /usr/lib/mono/gac rather than /usr/local/lib/mono/gac. If I correct
this to point to /usr/local/lib/mono/gac, SWF programs still don't work.

Here's the code I'm trying to run

// created on 26/06/2004 at 21:01

using System;
using System.Drawing;
using System.Windows.Forms;


public class TestTextBox : Form {

TextBox tb = new TextBox();
TextBox tb2 = new TextBox();

public static void Main() {

  Application.Run(new TestTextBox());

}

TestTextBox() {

  // some form text.
  Text = &quot;Textbox test&quot;;

  // label
  Label l = new Label();
  l.Size = new Size(300, 16);
  l.Text = &quot;Give me your name please:&quot;;
  l.Parent = this;
  l.Location = new Point(1,10);

  // textbox
  tb.Location = new Point(1,30);
  tb.MaxLength = 100;
  tb.Size = new Size(200,16);
  tb.Parent = this;

  // textbox
  tb2.Location = new Point(1,50);
  tb2.MaxLength = 100;
  tb2.Size = new Size(200,16);
  tb2.Parent = this;

  // Button
  Button b = new Button();
  b.Location = new Point(1,70);
  b.Text = &quot;Press me&quot;;
  b.Parent = this;
  b.Click += new EventHandler(ButtonOnClick);

}

void ButtonOnClick(object obj, EventArgs ea) {

  tb2.Text = tb.Text;
  MessageBox.Show(tb2.Text);
}
}

Which compiles happily and then gives when trying to run...

Something is still making it want to link to winelib.
