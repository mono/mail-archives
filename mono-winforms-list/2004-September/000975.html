</I>Paul,

I had the same problem, this is how I fixed it.

For some reason 'make install' in
mcs/class/Managed.Windows.Forms/ assumes that
your prefix is /usr/local regardless of what it is.

I had my prefix set as /usr and thought I
installed the MWF dll, but noticed the last line
(the one using gacutil) actually installs the dll
to /usr/local/lib/mono/gac.

This is the wrong place.

I work around this problem by copying that last
line of make instal (the gacutil line) and
changing the /usr/local part in it to /usr.

then instead of running make install, i just
re-run that gacutil line everytime i want to
install an updated version of the dll.

Not sure if it's the right way to do it, but it
works for me.

JBA
