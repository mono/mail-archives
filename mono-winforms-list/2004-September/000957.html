<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> I'll quote from my status update:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The X11 driver has only been used/tested on Linux, due to lack of time and
</I>&gt;<i> resources we haven't done anything on Solaris or Mac yet, maybe someone who
</I>&gt;<i> reads this will feel compelled to volunteer :-)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In other words - we're not working on Mac support, due to lack of time and
</I>&gt;<i> resources. I looked into it a bit, but I just can't find the time. If you
</I>&gt;<i> would like to volunteer, I will be delighted as I would love to have Mac
</I>&gt;<i> support. As for how to implement it, via X11 or natively, that is up to the
</I>&gt;<i> implementor. AFAIK, it should be possible to run SWF as is on the Mac today,
</I>&gt;<i> assuming that the DLL mapping tables are set up properly. (I remember
</I>&gt;<i> hearing/reading something about needing translation from .so to .dylib or
</I>&gt;<i> so)
</I>
The ideal situation I would think is to have a driver that uses
CoreGraphics directly so the app is native and does not require the user
to install X11 (X11 is not on the default installation in MacOS)
