<PRE>I installed mono using the RPM packages for Red Hat 9.0
What does I need do for update my SWF implementation?
I need build and install mono from sources? if it is true, Can you list =
me the steps for do it?
Thanks.

People who are new to mono project might find this link useful,

</I>&gt;<i> the build of those libraries which are depending on SWF once you get=20
</I>&gt;<i> errors. To disable the build of a particular library, you can go to=20
</I>&gt;<i> mcs/class/Makefile and remove/comment out the library name from the=20
</I>&gt;<i> SUBDIRS variable.
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Linux hackers, who have not ever built mono.
</I>&gt;<i>  You need to build and install mono and then follow steps above.
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Windows hackers, who run mono under cygwin.
</I>&gt;<i>  You can work same way as Linux hackers.
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Windows hackers, who just want to work on SWF.
</I>&gt;<i> (Following steps are for the hackers who are not comfortable with the=20
</I>&gt;<i> cvs. People who know cvs already can simply checkout the 'mcs' module=20
</I>&gt;<i> from mono cvs.)
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i>  a] Install some cvs client that has commandline interface. WinCVS=20
</I>&gt;<i> provides commandline interface.
</I>&gt;<i>  b] Open a command terminal. Go to the directory where you want mcs to =
</I>
&gt;<i> be checked out.
</I>&gt;<i>  c] Set an environment variable,
</I>&gt;<i>     set CVSROOT=3D:pserver:<A HREF="mailto:anonymous@anoncvs.go-mono.com">anonymous@anoncvs.go-mono.com</A>:/mono
</I>&gt;<i>  d] Login to cvs server (press enter when prompted for password),
</I>&gt;<i>     cvs login
</I>&gt;<i>  e] Checkout mcs and other modules you want,
</I>&gt;<i>     cvs -z3 co mcs mono winforms (this checks out mcs, mono and=20
</I>&gt;<i> winforms)  Please note that mcs is the module that contains new as=20
</I>&gt;<i> well as old SWF.
</I>&gt;<i>  f] The checkout operation above creates a directory called 'mcs' in=20
</I>&gt;<i> the current directory. Under .\mcs\class\Managed.Windows.Forms=20
</I>&gt;<i> directory, you can find SWF.csproj file. You can open this file with =
</I>VS.NET 2003.
&gt;<i> You might want to build the new SWF once it opens up in VS.NET.
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> Some notes for all SWF hackers:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Samples for SWF live under 'winforms' module in the cvs. You can=20
</I>&gt;<i> checkout this as you might have done for 'mcs'.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Under mcs/class/Managed.Windows.Forms/ directory, we have some=20
</I>&gt;<i> 'Design' and 'Guidelines' docs. 'Design' doc talks about the design of =
</I>
&gt;<i> the new implementation and 'Guidelines' doc talks about some of the=20
</I>&gt;<i> conventions we are following for hacking the new implementation. We=20
</I>&gt;<i> hope you would find these docs useful.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. To get the latest sources you would need to update the=20
</I>&gt;<i> Managed.Windows.Forms directory by setting the CVSROOT and running the =
</I>
&gt;<i> 'cvs update' command inside this directory. I recommend to update your =
</I>
&gt;<i> SWF code frequently as the code is changing almost everyday.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Please keep everyone on the list informed about the control you are =
</I>
&gt;<i> working on. So that, we don't duplicate the efforts.
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> I have tried to keep the steps as clear and complete as possible.=20
</I>&gt;<i> Please let me know, if you are not covered by the four categories I=20
</I>&gt;<i> have listed or you are facing any problems in setting up your=20
</I>&gt;<i> environment for the new SWF.
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> Happy hacking SWF!
