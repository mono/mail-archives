<PRE>This is the second question fielded in two days about the old SWF. Perhaps
the Mono website should be updated with some information about the new
implementation. Currently the only way to find out about it is to read the
list archives or ask on the list.

<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/contributing/winforms.html">http://www.mono-project.com/contributing/winforms.html</A>

I don't know who's in charge of the web site, but it's clearly outdated.
