Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt; Unhandled Exception: System.TypeInitializationException: An exception
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was thrown by the type initializer for System.Windows.Forms.Control ---=
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; System.TypeInitializationException: An exception was thrown by the type
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; initializer for System.Windows.Forms.Win32 ---&gt; System.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DllNotFoundException: winelib.exe.so
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i>   This error is not in current CVS. Either you have not compiled and
</I>&gt;<i> installed current CVS mono OR you have two mono's installed. Try 'which
</I>&gt;<i> mono' and make sure it is the same as your --prefix when building.
</I>
which mono shows /usr/bin/mono, which is correct as that's where I set
it for the prefix.

I originally thought I had not removed the original rpms, but I had. CVS
was fresh built this afternoon.

&gt;<i> &gt; in &lt;0x00050&gt; (wrapper managed-to-native) System.Windows.Forms.Win32:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; WineLoadLibrary (string)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;in 0x00390&gt; System.Windows.Forms.Win32:.cctor ()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is it likely that I have something somewhere which is causing mono to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bork when being called? I can't see anything in /usr/local/lib which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would cause the problem.
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i>   What about in /usr/local is there a mono in there?
</I>
No. I thought that was the problem.

One thing I did notice when running strace was that mono was
accessing /usr/lib/mono/1.0. When I looked, there was a 1.0 directory
(with symlinks to gac/1.0) and a 2.0 directory. Is this correct?

TTFN
