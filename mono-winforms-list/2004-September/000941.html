<PRE>thank you Peter.

good info on starting points.

I will look into both Carbon (native mac UI which I know pretty well -
approach b in your list) as well as cairo/X11 solution to see how far I can
get.

thinking that approach b would be better as it will give real mac look and
feel (which is what mac users really want and ask for), while X11/XDarwin
graphics interop appears to work really-really slow (looking at gtk/gtk#
ported monodevelop that I am using).

I will weight on both and get back to you with what I find out.
