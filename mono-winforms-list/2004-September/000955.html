<PRE>&gt;<i>Well, I think that will do it when the style is set to popup, but not
</I>&gt;<i>in other cases, for eg., a simple button. Right now, when drawing the
</I>&gt;<i>button in the theme, there's no way to know if the mouse is over the
</I>&gt;<i>button or not.
</I>
I'm trying to understand when you need to know if the mouse is over the 
control. Is this a general 'It'd be cool to know so we can have some fun 
with themes' request, or a 'we cannot properly implement MS compatible 
controls' request?

I'd be happy to add an internal overload with an additional bool that 
conveys mouse state, but I want to make sure that our controls by default 
behave like documented by MS, the drawing routines still need to implement 
popup as a mix of flat &amp; standard, even with the flag added.

I'll try and add the flag this afternoon.

Peter
