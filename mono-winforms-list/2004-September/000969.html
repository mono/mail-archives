Hi,

&gt;<i> Have you followed the instructions to build the managed windows forms
</I>&gt;<i> found here: <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/contributing/winforms.html">http://www.mono-project.com/contributing/winforms.html</A> ?
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> By default the old System.Windows.Forms.dll is built. You need to follow
</I>&gt;<i> those instructions to build the new System.Windows.Forms.
</I>
Followed it to the letter.

This box has never had mono on and was built fresh from cvs.

I've looked in /usr/local/lib/mono and the symlink for SWF points
to /usr/lib/mono/gac rather than /usr/local/lib/mono/gac. If I correct
this to point to /usr/local/lib/mono/gac, SWF programs still don't work.

Here's the code I'm trying to run

// created on 26/06/2004 at 21:01

using System;
using System.Drawing;
using System.Windows.Forms;
=20
=20
public class TestTextBox : Form {
=20
 TextBox tb =3D new TextBox();
 TextBox tb2 =3D new TextBox();
=20
 public static void Main() {
=20
  Application.Run(new TestTextBox());
  =20
 }
=20
 TestTextBox() {
=20
  // some form text.
  Text =3D &quot;Textbox test&quot;;
  =20
  // label
  Label l =3D new Label();
  l.Size =3D new Size(300, 16);
  l.Text =3D &quot;Give me your name please:&quot;;
  l.Parent =3D this;
  l.Location =3D new Point(1,10);
=20
  // textbox
  tb.Location =3D new Point(1,30);
  tb.MaxLength =3D 100;
  tb.Size =3D new Size(200,16);
  tb.Parent =3D this;
  =20
  // textbox
  tb2.Location =3D new Point(1,50);
  tb2.MaxLength =3D 100;
  tb2.Size =3D new Size(200,16);
  tb2.Parent =3D this; =20
  =20
  // Button
  Button b =3D new Button();
  b.Location =3D new Point(1,70);
  b.Text =3D &quot;Press me&quot;;
  b.Parent =3D this;
  b.Click +=3D new EventHandler(ButtonOnClick);
=20
 }
=20
 void ButtonOnClick(object obj, EventArgs ea) {
=20
  tb2.Text =3D tb.Text;
  MessageBox.Show(tb2.Text);
 }
} =20

Which compiles happily and then gives when trying to run...

Something is still making it want to link to winelib.
