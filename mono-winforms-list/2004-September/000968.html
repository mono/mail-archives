<PRE>Have you followed the instructions to build the managed windows forms
found here: <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/contributing/winforms.html">http://www.mono-project.com/contributing/winforms.html</A> ?

By default the old System.Windows.Forms.dll is built. You need to follow
those instructions to build the new System.Windows.Forms.

The 1.0/2.0 directory doesn't have anything to do with it.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; would cause the problem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   What about in /usr/local is there a mono in there?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No. I thought that was the problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One thing I did notice when running strace was that mono was
</I>&gt;<i> accessing /usr/lib/mono/1.0. When I looked, there was a 1.0 directory
</I>&gt;<i> (with symlinks to gac/1.0) and a 2.0 directory. Is this correct?
