<PRE>How are drivers being implemented? Do they map to the basic drawing
capabilities of the native OS?  Where can I find more information
about this?.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi All!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As some of you may know, we've had a SWF hack-a-thon in Provo last month. I
</I>&gt;<i> figured I'd give everyone a quick update about the current state of things.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For those who might have missed Miguel's message two months ago here a quick
</I>&gt;<i> intro: After having various problems with the approach of using Wine, like
</I>&gt;<i> threading support, installation issues, debuggability, interop with
</I>&gt;<i> System.Drawing, etc. we decided to start over and develop SWF from scratch
</I>&gt;<i> (again). Except that this time everything is fully implemented in managed
</I>&gt;<i> code. All controls are natively written in C#, using only System.Drawing and
</I>&gt;<i> a small 'driver' that provides the interface to the underlying Windowing
</I>&gt;<i> system.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At this point, we have the following controls fully implemented in managed
</I>&gt;<i> code:
</I>&gt;<i> - Label / LinkLabel
</I>&gt;<i> - Statusbar
</I>&gt;<i> - Toolbar
</I>&gt;<i> - Scrollbar (Horizontal/Vertical)
</I>&gt;<i> - Trackbar
</I>&gt;<i> - Button
</I>&gt;<i> - RadioButton
</I>&gt;<i> - CheckBox
</I>&gt;<i> - Picturebox (even supports animated pictures)
</I>&gt;<i> - ProgressBar
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These controls should all be fully usable and provide/implement all methods
</I>&gt;<i> and properties documented by Microsoft for System.Windows.Forms.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, the following controls being worked on:
</I>&gt;<i> - Edit
</I>&gt;<i> - Menu
</I>&gt;<i> - Groupbox
</I>&gt;<i> - Tooltip
</I>&gt;<i> - TabControl
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally, the Form and Control class are still a work in progress, not
</I>&gt;<i> yet complete. Control is tied very much into the underlying driver
</I>&gt;<i> architecture. Currently we have a driver for Win32, and a driver for X11.
</I>&gt;<i> The X11 driver has only been used/tested on Linux, due to lack of time and
</I>&gt;<i> resources we haven't done anything on Solaris or Mac yet, maybe someone who
</I>&gt;<i> reads this will feel compelled to volunteer :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some of the bigger issues we were facing with Wine, like multithreading, are
</I>&gt;<i> already solved in the new implementation. The developers.exe sample app that
</I>&gt;<i> shows off multithreading, timers and various controls already works nicely
</I>&gt;<i> with the new code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We've had volunteers, asking which areas need work, so here a list of
</I>&gt;<i> controls and classes/components that need tender loving care:
</I>&gt;<i> - ListControl
</I>&gt;<i>    ComboBox
</I>&gt;<i>    ListBox
</I>&gt;<i>      CheckedListBox
</I>&gt;<i> - MonthCalendar
</I>&gt;<i> - Splitter
</I>&gt;<i> - TreeView
</I>&gt;<i> - DomainUpDown
</I>&gt;<i> - NumericUpDown
</I>&gt;<i> - DateTimePicker
</I>&gt;<i> - Common Dialogs (probably only doable once all controls are done, unless
</I>&gt;<i> someone implements them on top of Microsoft's Win32 SWF)
</I>&gt;<i> - PrintPreviewControl
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Macintosh driver
</I>&gt;<i> - 64bit testing and/or support for Solaris
</I>&gt;<i> - Testing and support for other platforms
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The list is probably incomplete, and some things are very large tasks, like
</I>&gt;<i> the ListControl, which consist of several classes that can probably be
</I>&gt;<i> implemented somewhat independently of each other.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, if you would like to contribute but are unsure whether you have the
</I>&gt;<i> time or experience to contribute a whole control, we also need test
</I>&gt;<i> applications. Simple ones that just test every aspect of a single control as
</I>&gt;<i> well as more complex apps that have a purpose like a calculator. Anything
</I>&gt;<i> that helps sniff out bugs in the code or shows people how to use SWF for
</I>&gt;<i> their own needs is needed and welcome. And of course, we also still need
</I>&gt;<i> lots of documentation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The current implementation can be found in mcs/class/Managed.Windows.Forms,
</I>&gt;<i> and the core developers usually hang around #mono-winforms on gimpnet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>   Peter
</I>&gt;<i>
