<PRE>Hi Fabian,

	First off, your screenshots look amazing. What are you using to draw
the controls? Are you doing all the drawing with System.Drawing or
pinvoking into a windows themeing API?

&gt;<i> Another issue I've found is that the use of double buffering has some
</I>&gt;<i> problems when used with transparent bitmaps (buttons, radios, for
</I>&gt;<i> eg.). I've made some modifications to the sources to draw to the dc
</I>&gt;<i> directly, and everything works fine.
</I>
  I think we can just force the parent control to render, then blit the
parents DC before rendering our control. Thats a worse case scenario,
peter and I also discussed some better methods for this.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here, <A HREF="http://www.bobpowell.net/transcontrols.htm,">http://www.bobpowell.net/transcontrols.htm,</A> at the end, there's
</I>&gt;<i> an explanation. Maybe it's useful to change something in the
</I>&gt;<i> implementation.
</I>

&gt;<i> And the last thing I've found out it's that the dimensions of some
</I>&gt;<i> controls (radio, scrollbar, for eg.) are not the same as the theme, so
</I>&gt;<i> when I draw them they look stretched. It could be useful to include
</I>&gt;<i> some methods in the theme to obtain the sizes of the parts.
</I>
  The Theme needs to handle both sizing and drawing. Anywhere we are not
doing this is a bug that should be fixed. Do you have specific examples?

&gt;<i> I attach some pictures of what I've done.
</I> 
  Once again. These look awesome! Keep up the good work.

Cheers,
Jackson
