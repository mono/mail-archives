Hi,

I've compiled the latest cvs with the --with-preview option.

I can compile code which uses winforms without a problem, but when I try
to run the compiled program, all I seem to get is

Unhandled Exception: System.TypeInitializationException: An exception
was thrown by the type initializer for System.Windows.Forms.Control ---&gt;
System.TypeInitializationException: An exception was thrown by the type
initializer for System.Windows.Forms.Win32 ---&gt; System.
DllNotFoundException: winelib.exe.so

in &lt;0x00050&gt; (wrapper managed-to-native) System.Windows.Forms.Win32:
WineLoadLibrary (string)
&lt;in 0x00390&gt; System.Windows.Forms.Win32:.cctor ()

Is it likely that I have something somewhere which is causing mono to
bork when being called? I can't see anything in /usr/local/lib which
would cause the problem.

mono/mcs and associated libs are installed in /usr

TTFN

Paul
