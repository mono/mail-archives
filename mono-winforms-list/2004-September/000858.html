<PRE>Hi all,

One thing we added to the new SWF implementation is the ability to support
themes. Currently there is a &quot;Win32 Classic&quot; theme and a GTK theme. Jordi is
working on the GTK theme on the side in his spare time, dunno how far it is
along.

If you want to play with themes, you can set the MONO_THEME environment
variable, and set it to either 'win32' or to 'gtk' to try the two existing
themes we have.

If you want to implement your own theme, add some code to ThemeEngine.cs to
teach the system about the theme class, then implement your theme based on
the 'Theme' abstract class. The Theme.cs file will tell you all the methods
and properties required to implement your own theme.

Please be aware that we're still adding classes, so the Theme abstract class
is guaranteed to still grow and change. But, might be nice to play with it
nonetheless. If you are implementing a theme and are willing to maintain it
(at least 'til we reach the 'all controls implemented' state and the theme
class becomes stable) I'd love to add it to the distribution.

Cheers,
  Peter
