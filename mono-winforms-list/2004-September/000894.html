&gt;<i> Hey guys,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you know that it is possible to hack the new SWF from windows as well

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have seen some people wanting to contribute to our new implementation
</I>&gt;<i> of SWF, but finding it difficult to get the initial setup working. Here
</I>&gt;<i> I have listed out some of the steps to get a working setup of new SWF.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm going to list the steps for different types of hackers ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Linux hackers, who already have built and installed mono.
</I>&gt;<i>  It is as simple as to eat cake. We have created a new directory called
</I>&gt;<i> Managed.Windows.Forms parallel to System.Windows.Forms (old
</I>&gt;<i> implementation) under /cvs/mcs/class directory. All you need to do is
</I>&gt;<i> 'make clean' and 'make install' to get the new SWF installed. Running
</I>&gt;<i> 'make install' command in new or old implementation of SWF overwrites
</I>&gt;<i> the installed SWF dll.
</I>&gt;<i> Please note that once you install the new SWF, you might face problems
</I>&gt;<i> while building 'mcs' next time. The reason is there are some libraries
</I>&gt;<i> e.g. Npgsql that depend on some of the SWF classes that are not yet
</I>&gt;<i> implemented in the new implementation. To avoid this problem you can
</I>&gt;<i> either install the old SWF before building the new mcs or you disable
</I>&gt;<i> the build of those libraries which are depending on SWF once you get
</I>&gt;<i> errors. To disable the build of a particular library, you can go to
</I>&gt;<i> mcs/class/Makefile and remove/comment out the library name from the
</I>&gt;<i> SUBDIRS variable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Linux hackers, who have not ever built mono.
</I>&gt;<i>  You need to build and install mono and then follow steps above.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Windows hackers, who run mono under cygwin.
</I>&gt;<i>  You can work same way as Linux hackers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Windows hackers, who just want to work on SWF.
</I>&gt;<i> (Following steps are for the hackers who are not comfortable with the
</I>&gt;<i> cvs. People who know cvs already can simply checkout the 'mcs' module
</I>&gt;<i> from mono cvs.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  a] Install some cvs client that has commandline interface. WinCVS
</I>&gt;<i> provides commandline interface.
</I>&gt;<i>  b] Open a command terminal. Go to the directory where you want mcs to
</I>&gt;<i> be checked out.
</I>&gt;<i>  c] Set an environment variable,
</I>&gt;<i>     set CVSROOT=:pserver:<A HREF="mailto:anonymous@anoncvs.go-mono.com">anonymous@anoncvs.go-mono.com</A>:/mono
</I>&gt;<i>  d] Login to cvs server (press enter when prompted for password),
</I>&gt;<i>     cvs login
</I>&gt;<i>  e] Checkout mcs and other modules you want,
</I>&gt;<i>     cvs -z3 co mcs mono winforms (this checks out mcs, mono and winforms)
</I>&gt;<i>  Please note that mcs is the module that contains new as well as old
</I>&gt;<i> SWF.
</I>&gt;<i>  f] The checkout operation above creates a directory called 'mcs' in the
</I>&gt;<i> current directory. Under .\mcs\class\Managed.Windows.Forms directory,
</I>&gt;<i> you can find SWF.csproj file. You can open this file with VS.NET 2003.
</I>&gt;<i> You might want to build the new SWF once it opens up in VS.NET.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some notes for all SWF hackers:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Samples for SWF live under 'winforms' module in the cvs. You can
</I>&gt;<i> checkout this as you might have done for 'mcs'.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Under mcs/class/Managed.Windows.Forms/ directory, we have some
</I>&gt;<i> 'Design' and 'Guidelines' docs. 'Design' doc talks about the design of
</I>&gt;<i> the new implementation and 'Guidelines' doc talks about some of the
</I>&gt;<i> conventions we are following for hacking the new implementation. We hope
</I>&gt;<i> you would find these docs useful.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. To get the latest sources you would need to update the
</I>&gt;<i> Managed.Windows.Forms directory by setting the CVSROOT and running the
</I>&gt;<i> 'cvs update' command inside this directory. I recommend to update your
</I>&gt;<i> SWF code frequently as the code is changing almost everyday.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Please keep everyone on the list informed about the control you are
</I>&gt;<i> working on. So that, we don't duplicate the efforts.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have tried to keep the steps as clear and complete as possible. Please
</I>&gt;<i> let me know, if you are not covered by the four categories I have listed
</I>&gt;<i> or you are facing any problems in setting up your environment for the
</I>&gt;<i> new SWF.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Happy hacking SWF!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> - Ravi
