<PRE>Hello,

Let me give a bit of background, because I think that both approaches
have merits:

&gt;<i> First  of all what I  mean under that  term....
</I>&gt;<i> You probably have had a look  on my first edition of wine shared library 
</I>&gt;<i> ....
</I>&gt;<i> They are complete and fucntional, you can compile  any Windows 
</I>&gt;<i> application on Unix,
</I>
Yes, this is a useful feature for people who might want to port their
source code from Windows to Linux.  

Now, the situation is that for the particular use of Mono's
implementation of Windows.Forms we can get away with a less intrusive
system on the source code, and this is what Peter has done.

It has the advantage of touching Wine only minimally (which increases
the chances of getting our changes into the main Wine distribution), and
at the same time exports the needed functionality that we need from Wine
for using inside Mono's Windows.Forms.

So I think that the Wine situation is now under control, and we can now
move along.

There is still a lot of work left to be done though:

	* The display driver that interacts with Cairo or GDI+.

	* The C# code side of the equation.

	* Assisting on the GDI+ implementation.

	* Plenty of controls, both for the 1.1 framework, as well as
	  for the upcoming 1.2 framework

Miguel
