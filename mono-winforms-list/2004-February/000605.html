<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> What are the problems? I have not really seen mention of any in this
</I>&gt;<i> list. If they are being discussed, where is the discussion taking place?
</I>&gt;<i> I am sure that many of us are willing to help, but have no idea what is
</I>&gt;<i> going on.
</I>
The short answer is &quot;soon&quot;.  The long answer is:

* When Peter was fixing the Wine/Cairo integration issues, he found
  a way of doing this cleanly: to build a driver that knows about
  Cairo/GDI+.

* When he started writing the driver, we noticed that our patches Wine
  was too old, and that the code we wrote would have to be discarded
  when we upgraded to Wine.  So...

* Peter started working on porting/patching the latest Wine to work as 
  a library.  Peter noticed that the new Wine requires even less changes
  to turn into a library and found a fairly clever way of even being able
  to turn Wine into a library and minimizing the changes.  

  These are good news, because we might be able to merge the few changes
  into the main Wine.

* We will be building packages of the modified Wine very soon now ;-)

* Work on the C#-side of Windows.Forms will resume in a couple of days.

Miguel.
