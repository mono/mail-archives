&gt; &gt;Hey guys,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I saw a commit that said NumericUpDown was implemented so I wired it
&gt; &gt;into MonthCalendar (which should now be considered feature complete).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Along the way I discovered what I think are bugs in NumericUpDown. If
&gt; &gt;NumericUpDown is not actually complete yet then feel free to ignore
&gt; &gt;these points:
&gt; 
&gt; Well, it should essentially be complete, but let's see what you've got.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;- Setting the Value property for the numeric up down control while it's
&gt; &gt;not visible results in that value not being set. I believe the flow is
&gt; &gt;this:
&gt; &gt;	Set .Visible = false
&gt; &gt;	Set .Minimum 
&gt; &gt;	.Value now has .Minimum as it's value
&gt; &gt;	Set .Value;
&gt; &gt;	.Value calls one of the updateedit method which inturn uses a parseedit
&gt; &gt;method which for some reason reads the minimum value as the current text
&gt; &gt;and so .Value gets reset to parsed minimum value.
To repro this just run the monthcalendar example in the winforms svn
module. The first calendar is November 2004. When you click on the year,
it sets the Value of the NumericUpDown to 2004 (while it's not visible)
and then displays it. The thing is that when it displays the
NumericUpDown it is set to 1953 not 2004 (1953 is the minimum value).
&gt; 
&gt; I wrote up a test case but was unable to reproduce your results. Can you
&gt; reduce it to a minimal test case for me?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;- It's not responding to Readonly property correctly (.ReadOnly = true
&gt; &gt;means up/down buttons work but not text editing.
&gt; 
&gt; This is the correct behaviour for .ReadOnly.
Yeah it is, except the numericupdown doesn't do this. Peter said it was
due to textbox anyhow.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;- It seems to render buttons on windows for me, but not on linux
&gt; 
&gt; This is probably a bug in mono's ControlPaint or whatever ControlPaint
&gt; calls (something in the theme library).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;- It doesn't seem to be handling the key press events (this may be an
&gt; &gt;issue with the way I'm using it though).
&gt; 
&gt; It does for me :-)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;There was something else about the way MonthCalendar render's on linux
&gt; &gt;but I can't remember it now. Will send that through when I remember.
&gt; 
&gt; Okay :-)
