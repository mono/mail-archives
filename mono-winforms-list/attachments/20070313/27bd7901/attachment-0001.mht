Hi,

I know I should be posting this to winforms list, but it is rejecting my 
email... :-(

 I've just downloaded, compiled and tested latest from SVN. We had several
 problems, many of them regarding to the list view, which are now fixed.

 But the bad news is: the tree view is broken (it doesn't even show up),
 there are many problems on form resizing (our wizard was working correctly
 two weeks ago or so and now is totally broken).

 I could try to file all bugs, but it is maybe easier if somehow we can
 collaborate, maybe making some testing ourselves weekly, maybe giving you
 Plastic to test... I don't know.

 Maybe it will also help if somebody (I would do it myself) could check the
 fixes before they are integrated (branch per task would greatly help
here...
 :-P )


 Thanks

 pablo
