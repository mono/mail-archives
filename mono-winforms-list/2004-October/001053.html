<PRE>Hi Henry,
Our gdiplus.dll comes from a separate module called libgdiplus.
You can get it from cvs or use the rpms.
You also need to set your $LD_LIBRARY_PATH to tell the location
of libgdiplus.so to your system.

I hope Paul's URL would be quite helpful for you.

If you are interested to know more about System.Drawing and
SWF, following links would tell you about our approach,

</I>I probably have to read further back on the list
but can't find any reference

I am running Mandrake
I get all sorts of errors from gdiplus.dll missing
to cannot find '/usr/lib/winelib.exe.so'

I get also:

Warning: the specified Windows directory L&quot;c:\\windows&quot; is not
accessible.
Warning: the specified System directory L&quot;c:\\windows\\system&quot; is not
accessible.
Warning: could not find DOS drive for current working directory
'/home/henry/winshare'

when running as root i get the following:

err:font:ReadFontDir Can't open directory
&quot;/usr/share/fonts/ttf/western&quot;
and
 ---&gt; System.DllNotFoundException: gdiplus.dll

Where can I get gdiplus.dll from? Is that part of .NET 1.1 ?
I tried installing it via wine Internet Explorer Windows Update
and of course it bummed out

Does anyone know of a site with lil tips and tricks to make at least
such a simple example work?

Looks like its much more work than installing the mandrake rpms
which I really thought would take care of everything (including
pointing to the correct libraries)

any hints I would be grateful

Henry
