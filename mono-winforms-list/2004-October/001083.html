<PRE>&gt;<i> But surely, this isn't a mono problem? If the X server isn't running
</I>&gt;<i> (say a machine is set to runlevel 3), then the libraries won't be loaded
</I>&gt;<i> either. An X session won't be started so the best that can happen is an
</I>&gt;<i> exception is thrown. As I've said though, the error report would vary
</I>&gt;<i> between platforms...
</I>Well, it's not a Mono problem per se, no, if you want to display via X you 
need an X-Server. But, the libs will load just fine even if no X-Server is 
run on the machine where they are being loaded. After all, just loading they 
won't know if there's an X-Server running or not, and X-servers can be 
remote.
We're just not handling the fact that we can't open the display, and that is 
ultimately a Mono/MWF problem. All we need to do is deal with XOpenDisplay 
returning null, instead of just assuming it didn't. At that point we can 
choose to throw an exception or even just display an error message and exit 
the app. Simple fix. In fact, so simple, I just fixed it in the head CVS 
version :-)

Cheers,
  Peter
