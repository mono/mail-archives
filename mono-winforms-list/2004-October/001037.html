<PRE>Ok, turns out the #D guys used a comparison tool that employs the Longest
Common Substring algorithm.

The #D plagiarism story(non-fiction ;]) is here:

I found it rather interesting.

Peter,
	The guys at sharpdevelop ran into an issue where a MS MVP wrote an
SWF screen designer that plagiarized the screen designer code used in
sharpdevelop.  To prove it, #D folks ran some kind of code comparison(more
than a simple diff) test that gave them a match rating that proved their
code was copied.  The plagiarizer then confessed.  Well, half heartadly.
Anyway, it may be a good idea to do the same with any contributed MWF code
where it is compared to the MS SWF disassembled code.  Certainly it could
help in protecting Novell and Mono from the perils of plagiarism.

Regards,
Dan Maltes

Subject: [Mono-winforms-list] Important information about contributing to
MWF

Hi Guys and Gals,

Recently, the issue of disassembling Microsoft's SWF.dll to find out how to
do certain things came up. This is something that can cause serious
problems. Our goal is to have a clean implementation, developed using only
published documentation from Microsoft and others. Disassembling and/or
using the the information gleaned from disassembly it will taint our code
and render it unusable.

If we really do have code that behaves not compatible with MS's SWF.dll we
can find out by writing test code and comparing behaviour side by side,
modifying our code until it matches MS. We might not find all things right
out of the gate, but once we reach a point where apps can be run, we will
get bug reports about those incompatibilties out and can fix them then.

Personally, I think part of the fun is writing it from scratch, not peeking
at someone else's code, it's also much more challenging.

Cheers,
  Peter
