<PRE>Hey guys,

I've managed to forget who asked me to do it originally, but I've
finally started working on a general MWF tester app that can be used to
do manual and visual tests on controls. I figured the best way to go
about this (not to mention the laziest) would be to doodle myself an app
in vs.net, since most of Novell's potential MWF customers are going to
be vs.net converts.

I had originally started with a form containing a tabcontrol, which in
turn contained a label, textbox, and button. I was getting a lot of
font-related errors until I removed all the label/textbox/button code,
but I still ended up with this:

<A HREF="http://www.cityhost.ca/~steve/tmp/mwftester/greybox.png">http://www.cityhost.ca/~steve/tmp/mwftester/greybox.png</A>

The code is in a zip file in:

<A HREF="http://www.cityhost.ca/~steve/tmp/mwftester/">http://www.cityhost.ca/~steve/tmp/mwftester/</A>

If anyone has any interest in looking at it, I'd be curious to know
what's going on here.

Finally, a few quick questions:
- It looks like TextBox is broken - is it, or is it just me? :) If it
is, do we have an ETA on it?
- Should I avoid things like docking/anchoring for now, or are these
ready to be tested (it just occurred to me that I docked that tabcontrol
absent-mindedly).

Thanks for the help guys. Please pardon my oversights - I haven't been
following the MWF progress as closely as I probably should be.
