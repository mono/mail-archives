<PRE>Hi Guys and Gals,

Recently, the issue of disassembling Microsoft's SWF.dll to find out how to 
do certain things came up. This is something that can cause serious 
problems. Our goal is to have a clean implementation, developed using only 
published documentation from Microsoft and others. Disassembling and/or 
using the the information gleaned from disassembly it will taint our code 
and render it unusable.

If we really do have code that behaves not compatible with MS's SWF.dll we 
can find out by writing test code and comparing behaviour side by side, 
modifying our code until it matches MS. We might not find all things right 
out of the gate, but once we reach a point where apps can be run, we will 
get bug reports about those incompatibilties out and can fix them then.

Personally, I think part of the fun is writing it from scratch, not peeking 
at someone else's code, it's also much more challenging.

Cheers,
  Peter
