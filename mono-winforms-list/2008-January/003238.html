<PRE>Paul,

 

I browsed a bit through the source code, guided by your stack trace. It
seems that Mono tries to fetch the font 'MS Sans Serif' (see font.c -&gt;
GdipGetGenericFontFamilySansSerif). Could you check if you have that font
installed? If you don't have it, perhaps you could rename some other generic
font to 'MS Sans Serif' to check if that helps.

 

Perhaps someone more involved in libgdiplus development could shed a light
on my assessment?

 

Erik

Thanks for the response.  I'm trying to runs this application under X11, it
gives the error detailed.
 
Also, this happens with *any* mono application, I'm guessing the problem
lies in my X11 / mono configuration somewhere but I've no idea where to
start looking.

Hi Paul, 

 

I notice in your stack trace there is something about a font family missing,
I have read here:
<A HREF="http://groups.google.com/group/cocoa-sharp-dev/browse_thread/thread/4be54c8a">http://groups.google.com/group/cocoa-sharp-dev/browse_thread/thread/4be54c8a</A>
401ad445 that you need X11 installed for something font-related.

 

That's all I can think of right now, other things I do sometimes is to check
out the source code and see why it goes wrong. That may provide insight in
what to google for, or workarounds.

 

Hope this helps,

Erik Renes

Subject: [Mono-winforms-list] running winforms application on OS X

 

HI all, hopefully someone can help with this, I've been googling for answers
to this problem for 2 days now without any luck.

 

Basically, I'm at the stage where my application (originally written in
.Net, ported to mono on linux, now trying to port to OS X) compiles fine,
but running it provokes the error at the bottom of this message.

 

Further testing has revealed that this error occurs for *any* mono
application.  Googling has revealed several cases of this error with
winforms on OS X but no useful solution.  I've tried copying fonts from my
windows machine to ~/fonts and running mkfontdir on that directory but this
results in 'Bus error'.  

 

Please help!

 

Here's the error:
