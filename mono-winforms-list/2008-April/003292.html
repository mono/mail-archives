<PRE>I'm working in VB on VS (Winforms) and Mono 1.9 and my apps are working fine
except when I run them under Mono it's almost like the text inside of each
control is being cut off and all my windows and context menus appear to be
&quot;hacked off&quot;, even a simple right-click {copy, paste} the context menu is
cut short.

I followed the FAQ: Winforms to get the main window to resize correctly, but
all my other windows and even my controls on that main window are still &quot;cut
off&quot;. I tried the export and still nothing. Also, I'm getting the same
results on both the Windows and Linux versions of Mono. I'm thinking that
maybe there is an issue with font that is missing? I have checked all over
and can't seem to find a recommended font for mono applications. I also
tried to create a simple app with just a Menu control and also got the exact
same results.

I have disabled &quot;XP Style Menus&quot; and even tried to set a static size for the
controls. This will make the control bigger, but it still hacks off the
text.

In case my question is too hard to follow, please see the screen shot at:
