<PRE>The dll uxtheme takes care of all theming. &quot;Real&quot; xp apps use new versions of 
comctl32 and friends in which uxtheme.dll is used as a plugin. Other apps use 
it directly.

The dll takes care of all theme loading and stuff related to that. I'm about 
sure this dll can be implemented using gtk calls and even other api's. The 
opposite of this is already happening with gtk on winxp. Using uxtheme.dll to 
theme GTK ;) Check out gtk-winp.sf.net

Note that uxtheme will need a thread on wine-devel, since it needs some 
changes in a few other dlls. Since the uxtheme dll itself doesn't do that 
much.

Here is some more information of the working of it all:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Some time ago I emailed with you about this too, congratulations so far.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Perhaps it is time now to start a full wine theming thread. Perhaps on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wine-devel too.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The Wine guys love to have some way of theming too. The simple color
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; changing stuff is the first step. Just hacking Wine to make it look like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GTK is not the correct solution and will about sure never make it back in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; real Wine. It won't work for all controls and it is really a hack.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An increasingly common hack it seems. I chose it because I figured it
</I>&gt;<i> would be the fastest to see results on, but agreed it isn't the best
</I>&gt;<i> solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The real solution is to do what WindowsXP is doing. XP is using a special
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; theme library called &quot;uxtheme.dll&quot;. It can be accessed directly from an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; app but most apps don't use it directly. WindowsXP's control related dlls
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use it too. XP uses two sets of comctl32 and friends. One &quot;old&quot; one and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one with theming. The comctl32 and other dlls then contain some options
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to enable theming and contain some area in which you can draw. I looked
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into it a bit in the past. Not sure how it fully works but this is the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; real way to go.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've heard this. Unfortunately I don't have a copy of windows XP to play
</I>&gt;<i> with, but that's what the wine guys said when I raised this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So you're suggesting that the uxtheme.dll be written to render stuff
</I>&gt;<i> with GTK? Does that mean replacing x11drv with a gdkdrv so that there
</I>&gt;<i> are GdkDrawables to draw on? If so we're not really departing that far
</I>&gt;<i> from the hacky solution -- it's just a bit more compartmentalised.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> James.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So in short on XP the core dlls are patched to use uxtheme.dll for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; theming.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Lets hope this triggers a full thread :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I posted ages ago about wanting to work on the wine GTK look part of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the mono project. It's been a while, but I have actually made some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; progress. I have code now which will set wine's colours to match the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; GTK theme (well some of the colours, the rest of them is just a case of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; me having time and patience to finish it). The other achievement was to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; get a GdkWindow from the XID that Wine uses to display stuff and map a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Gtk Button to it. Alas the button is not as yet displaying, which is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; why I'm writing. The problem as I see it is simply that the gtk main
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; loop isn't running, so whatever it is that actually draws the button
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; inside the expose event in a normal gtk app just isn't running. The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; patch is a bit of a mess, but if there's interest I'd love to get some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; feedback from someone who knows the internals of gtk/gdk a bit better.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I'm sure that after I'm over this hurdle, the rest will be far faster
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and simpler to implement.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; James.
