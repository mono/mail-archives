<PRE>Hi James,

Some time ago I emailed with you about this too, congratulations so far.
Perhaps it is time now to start a full wine theming thread. Perhaps on 
wine-devel too.

The Wine guys love to have some way of theming too. The simple color changing 
stuff is the first step. Just hacking Wine to make it look like GTK is not 
the correct solution and will about sure never make it back in real Wine. It 
won't work for all controls and it is really a hack.

The real solution is to do what WindowsXP is doing. XP is using a special 
theme library called &quot;uxtheme.dll&quot;. It can be accessed directly from an app 
but most apps don't use it directly. WindowsXP's control related dlls use it 
too. XP uses two sets of comctl32 and friends. One &quot;old&quot; one and one with 
theming. The comctl32 and other dlls then contain some options to enable 
theming and contain some area in which you can draw. I looked into it a bit 
in the past. Not sure how it fully works but this is the real way to go.

So in short on XP the core dlls are patched to use uxtheme.dll for theming.

Lets hope this triggers a full thread :)

Thanks,
Roderick Colenbrander

&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I posted ages ago about wanting to work on the wine GTK look part of the
</I>&gt;<i> mono project. It's been a while, but I have actually made some progress.
</I>&gt;<i> I have code now which will set wine's colours to match the GTK theme
</I>&gt;<i> (well some of the colours, the rest of them is just a case of me having
</I>&gt;<i> time and patience to finish it). The other achievement was to get a
</I>&gt;<i> GdkWindow from the XID that Wine uses to display stuff and map a Gtk
</I>&gt;<i> Button to it. Alas the button is not as yet displaying, which is why I'm
</I>&gt;<i> writing. The problem as I see it is simply that the gtk main loop isn't
</I>&gt;<i> running, so whatever it is that actually draws the button inside the
</I>&gt;<i> expose event in a normal gtk app just isn't running. The patch is a bit
</I>&gt;<i> of a mess, but if there's interest I'd love to get some feedback from
</I>&gt;<i> someone who knows the internals of gtk/gdk a bit better. I'm sure that
</I>&gt;<i> after I'm over this hurdle, the rest will be far faster and simpler to
</I>&gt;<i> implement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
