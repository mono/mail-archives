<PRE>Hey,

    Hello folks,

     The following patch gets Paint.NET 2.72 to start up, the porting
effort has taken less time than the time it took to port Paint.NET 1,
mostly because I could cut and paste a handful of routines, I did not
repeat the same mistakes and because it uses 2.0 APIs.

     In some cases I had to implement some missing stuff (SafeHandles
were the most elaborate, a handful of events and some stubs).

     The port is by no means complete, tomorrow I have to look at the
DrawBitmap which changed a lot since 1.0 and currently does not paint
anything. 

     Attached is a patch to get a pristine 2.72 Paint.NET to build with
MonoDevelop (Am using SVN as it has some decent Visual Studio 2005
solution importing support).   I would love to have a complete Makefile
setup at some point, because MonoDevelop still has some odd rules that I
can not quite grasp while rebuilding code.

     Also a screenshot is included which shows a lot of areas that will
need some work.

     Those with access to SVN can pull out their own copy from here:

svn co svn+<A HREF="ssh://LOGIN@mono-cvs.ximian.com/extras/trunk/pdn272/trunk/pdn272">ssh://LOGIN@mono-cvs.ximian.com/extras/trunk/pdn272/trunk/pdn272</A>

     Notice that this tree is not available on AnonSVN.
