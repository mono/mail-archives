<PRE>Most the apps I tried (ToolStripDemo, PDN, Reversi) look good pretty 
good [on Windows].  I ran into two problems:

- It looks like the Menu is trying to draw off of the initial NCPAINT, 
but the IsHandleCreated is false, which it doesn't check, causing it to 
access Handle and create a loop.  Test case attached.

- Scrollbars in ComboBoxes are not drawn until they are clicked.  It may 
be Scrollbars are set to Visible before their owning control is created. 
  Test case attached.

Both issues are easily reproducible using FormsTest as well.
