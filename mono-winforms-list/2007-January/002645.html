&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been following the development of Mono for quite some time and have
</I>&gt;<i> managed to get most of my c# application written for .Net 2 working.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The original requirement was to write the application for windows only,
</I>&gt;<i> but as more and more features have been added, it has become very useful
</I>&gt;<i> and our Linux developers here have asked for a version they can use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't been given any time to port something of this size to Java, so
</I>&gt;<i> Mono seemed to be a good option.
</I>&gt;<i> My first step was to get it compiling under Mono, this was made
</I>&gt;<i> difficult initially as I had written it for .Net v2 using many of the
</I>&gt;<i> new features for convenience. I started out by writing stub subclasses
</I>&gt;<i> and methods to implement features not currently supported by Mono, in
</I>&gt;<i> some cases the stub functions did nothing, and in other cases I
</I>&gt;<i> implemented the drawing, events and other apis. Gradually I've been
</I>&gt;<i> removing the stub functions as the features have been implemented, but
</I>&gt;<i> still have not got to the stage where the application works totally and
</I>&gt;<i> reliably.
</I>&gt;<i> The main feature that my application uses is the virtual listview. I had
</I>&gt;<i> originally downloaded the Microsoft version before it was introduced in
</I>&gt;<i> .Net 2, and have relied on this very useful control in a number of
</I>&gt;<i> places within my application.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone have any idea when this will be implemented?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have toyed with the idea of actually contributing, but it would need
</I>&gt;<i> to be from home, and I haven't had too much time recently.
</I>&gt;<i> I did try to get the source building, but my initial attempt under
</I>&gt;<i> windows failed, but I may try again under Linux.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Keep up the good work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards
</I>&gt;<i>
