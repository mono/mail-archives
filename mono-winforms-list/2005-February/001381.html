Sorry; thanks.  I'll maybe look at them when I have a moment.
(This is all leading up to me having to look at how well a massive .NET 
product is going to behave on linux; I'm not currently hopeful)

Yes, but why do I have to specify what the third party has chosen to use to 
implement their black box?  I thought we'd got over that stupidity with C a 
decade or two ago.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why, what have you tried that didn't work?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Day01 - MyForm.cs - Compiles (when you know how), runs.  Throws some sort of 
font complaints; terribly slow, puts characters into the text box in the 
wrong order.
Day16 - FormApp.cs - Reasonable.  Null exception on closedown.  Big deal!!!
PicForm.cs Doesn't display the jpg picture.  No big surprise.; that's a lot to 
ask
BorderForm.cs - The fixed borders are resizable
ButtonApp.cs - Terrible repaint behaviour; keeps hiding the content
GetName.cs - Totally unusable.  Button doesn't display.

&gt;<i> Cheers,
