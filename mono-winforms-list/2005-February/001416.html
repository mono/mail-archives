Congratulations on a successful web page; please don't take the following as 
criticism; it's just that I'm a pedantic little ... and I think the following 
might make things even easier for lovers of little yellow books.

(1. What browser are you targetting; the main page (mono/mono-compiling.html) 
looks messy in all the browsers I've tried; Firefox on RHEL3 and on Win2K, 
IE6 on Win2k, Konqueror on RHEL3.  The source looks fine but obviously there 
is something there that taxes the browsers)

2. The script is useful but doesn't quite work right first time.
2a. The CVS update on cairo/pixman won't work on the first occasion; it needs 
cvs co if there is no CVS/Entries
2b but should you be getting the cairo/pixman now since they are in 
libgdiplus?
2c. Don't know why the monodevelop didn't work for me; might have been a 
temporary glitch.  Anyway, not relevant.

3. Thanks for not assuming we are going to run this as root.
4. Can I suggest using su -c &quot;make install&quot; (a single command rather than 3 
commands)

5. In line 7 of your step-by-step figure it should be cd ../mono; the cd is 
missing

6. I can't see the stuff about LD_LIBRARY_PATH on this page; I would suggest 
that you add 
su -l -c &quot;ldconfig&quot; after the make install in libgdiplus, (or simply ldconfig 
if you choose not to use su -c for the make install; makes sense here)
Then you could add a little note at the end of the section about when that 
would make sense (if /usr/local/lib or /usr/lib is in /etc/ld.so.conf) and 
when the user should use LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
