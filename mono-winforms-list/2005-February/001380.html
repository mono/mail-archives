<PRE>&gt;<i>Yes, but I was turned off the SVN because it currently doesn't build on my
</I>&gt;<i>system (I haven't figured out why)
</I>I was not suggesting you build Winforms from source, just pointing to simple 
examples that might help you get a feel for winforms apps and building them, 
and show you what is working already.

&gt;<i>(I, of course, regard it is a problem that I have to specify the
</I>&gt;<i>/r:System.Drawing since I shouldn't have to worry about how
</I>&gt;<i>System.Windows.Forms is implemented)
</I>Actually, that's something that Microsoft came up with, that you're required 
to specify the assembly you want to link against. It's neither a mono 
specific thing, nor related to how SWF is implemented. And the /r: switch is 
also defined by Microsoft, on their csc.exe

&gt;<i>I have plenty of examples to work with ; Bradley L Jones' &quot;Teach yourself 
</I>&gt;<i>the
</I>&gt;<i>C# Language in 21 days&quot;.  I guess it's going to take a few months yet until
</I>&gt;<i>the Winforms stuff really stabilises and becomes usable.
</I>Why, what have you tried that didn't work?

Cheers,
 Peter
