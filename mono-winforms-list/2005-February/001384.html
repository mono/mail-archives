This doesn't have to do with the implementation of System.Windows.Forms.
Its only needed if the application uses types from System.Drawing.

</I>&gt;<i> Day16 - FormApp.cs - Reasonable.  Null exception on closedown.  Big deal!!!
</I>&gt;<i> PicForm.cs Doesn't display the jpg picture.  No big surprise.; that's a lot to 
</I>&gt;<i> ask
</I>&gt;<i> BorderForm.cs - The fixed borders are resizable
</I>&gt;<i> ButtonApp.cs - Terrible repaint behaviour; keeps hiding the content
</I>&gt;<i> GetName.cs - Totally unusable.  Button doesn't display.
</I>

Have you filed bugs for any of these issues?

Cheers,
Jackson
