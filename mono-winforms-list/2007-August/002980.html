  I've got a situation with MDI forms where the behavior is different on
MS vs mono, but it's proving difficult to get a simple test project that
reproduces it.  The problem is that in my app setting the Form.MdiParent
is causing that Form's handle to be created in mono when it doesn't on
MS.NET.   And it doesn't happen for simple test programs on mono either;
with simple test programs setting the MdiParent property doesn't cause
the handle to be created.  I think it must be something about my real
project that causes this, but the program is so large it's difficult to
tell what that might be.  Here's a partial call stack from the
Form.HandleCreated event.  Does this info give enough info to someone to
make some guesses about what could cause the MdiParent property to
trigger the HandleCreated in some projects but not in others?

  Thanks in advance for any ideas!

 Partial call stack:

at MyChildForm.on_HandleCreated(System.Object sender, System.EventArgs
e)
