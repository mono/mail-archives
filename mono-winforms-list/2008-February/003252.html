No it doesn't, but you might be hitting a bug related to #324472 -
&quot;Attribute.GetCustomAttributes doesn't get inherited attributes for
properties&quot; (<A HREF="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=324472">https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=324472</A>)

&gt;<i> I also did some

</I>&gt;<i> fixed the only issue I found (NRE when null passed in).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Kudos to Gert and my bad I didn't review my changes better.

&gt;<i> On the &quot;property tab support&quot;.  I haven't managed to get MSFT to display
</I>&gt;<i> an events tab.  I presume one has to do stuff with
</I>&gt;<i> System.Windows.Forms.Design.EventsTab to get it to appear.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You would need to have the PropertyGrid Sited (.Site = ...) to an
ISite that provides an IEventBindingService, because that would be how
the EventsTab will use to feed the propertygrid with events as
properties.

&gt;<i> What did you mean by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   * Implement TypeDescriptor Associations and Providers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This will be a biggie. Basically Associations are where you associate
a component with others, so that the associated components are used
instead of the original component or something along the lines.
Providers are a way to modify the metadata provided by a component
because instead of asking the component directly of its e.g properties
the provider is being asked. This indirectly related to the ability of
the PG to handle extended metadata (PG uses TypeDescriptor).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> get_Property is called twice for each item when
</I>&gt;<i> opening a drop-down, etc) but I'll re-check against the new build before
</I>&gt;<i> I log them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Things are improving greatly!
</I>
The get_Property one is not a bug. It's an implementation detail,
which doesn't make a difference behavior-wise and one shouldn't rely
on the number of time get_Property gets called. I do not think MS can
guarantee you that either. Conclusion: not a bug, could be regarded as
a future optimization though. Optimizing the GridEntry class with some
caching is on the todo list.
