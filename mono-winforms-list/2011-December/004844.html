<PRE>I started having a rather unexpected problem while remaking an older program
of mine. As part of it I copied some work I had already done involving a
form that launches a couple of folderbrowser dialogs for typical path
selections. However, when the dialogs open, they are empty. The create new
folder, cancel, and OK buttons all appear but there is no way to navigate to
a desired folder. I have not found any evidence that this is happening to
anyone else

To make things a bit weirder The older program running the same code,
compiled on the same system works just fine. Then to test it I created a
super stripped down program that does nothing more than create folder
browser dialog and it appears blank on my windows system and works fine on
my linux system(running monod 2.4)

using System;
using System.Windows.Forms;
using System.Globalization;

namespace ScreenSaver1
{
    static class Program
    {
                        
      
        static void Main(string[] args)        {            
               
                FolderBrowserDialog fd = new FolderBrowserDialog();
		fd.ShowDialog();
                
            
        }
    }
}


It doesn't get much simpler than that and I'm confused as to why it works in
one situation and not in two others. I upgraded to monodevelop 2.8.5 and the
same behavior persists in all respects. I'm not the greatest programmer in
the world so I'm not sure if there is something about the dialog I do not
know, or if I have run into some obscure bug that doesn't seem to be
bothering anyone else which is hard to imagine.
