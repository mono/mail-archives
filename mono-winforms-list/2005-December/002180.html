<PRE>Hi,

I finally got around to seeing the WinForms implementation in Linux.
And even when exporting the &quot;nice&quot; theme (export MONO_THEME=nice) -
let's face it, Winforms currently looks awful. If an example is
required, then take a look at
<A HREF="http://www.vladsharp.com/images/prog/winforms_look.png">http://www.vladsharp.com/images/prog/winforms_look.png</A>

But enough complaining. How can it be made better? I don't have any
clue on implementation details, but since WinForms is a canvas-based
implementation, I don't see any reason why it couldn't look as good,
or better, than, say, Swing applications in Java.
(<A HREF="http://www.vladsharp.com/images/prog/swing_look.png">http://www.vladsharp.com/images/prog/swing_look.png</A>) I don't even
know Swing that well, but I do know it looks much better that (e.g.)
the default forms look in Firefox on Linux. Why can't Linux look good?
Well, there are toolkits to change to make the default look look good.
But why can't Mono's Windows.Forms implementation look good? Yes, it
might take time to get a decent look, but can it not be done?

Regards,
