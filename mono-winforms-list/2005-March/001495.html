If Microsoft's implementation allows the Matrix to be used after it has
been Dispose()d, this would tend to indicate that they are actually storing
the matrix in managed memory, and that while a System.Drawing.Graphics has
an unmanaged matrix involved with the GDI+ operations, a
System.Drawing.Drawing2D.Matrix simply duplicates the matrix data in
managed memory. Changing mono to behave this way would be a lot more
logical than changing Dispose() to not perform its task.

This is probably something I could do myself :-) Jordi?
