The patch changes the way the image is loaded. libpng has a convenience
function where it can automatically upsample the image on behalf of the
application. Before the patch, pngcodec.c uses this function, because all
bitmaps needed to be 32-bit RGB anyway. After the patch, pngcodec.c checks
if it is a palettized file, and if it is, attempts to retrieve the 1-, 4-
or 8-bpp bits (if it's 2-bpp then it resamples it to 4-bpp, since there is
no PixelFormat.Format2bppIndexed), as well as the palette which it attaches
to the GpImage.

It seems rather odd that libpng would tell you the palette was invalid. Can
you make a sample PNG file that fails available so that I can do some testing?
