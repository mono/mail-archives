Hi guys, 

I am having a little problem with using WinForms in OsX. I am using a timer
to call the &quot;refresh&quot; method for drawing an animation. However, when this
drawing is time consuming (i.e. if you maximise the window), there is a
prolonged delay in handing a &quot;mousemove&quot; event. That is, although the
animation is still running smoothly, it seems that the &quot;mousemove&quot; event is
being buffered and responded to some time later. I have attached the given
project below. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated, as I would love
to use mono for some professional projects I am working on, but can't seem
to get around these &quot;features&quot; 

Cheers, 

Scott
