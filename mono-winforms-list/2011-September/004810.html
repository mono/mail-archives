<PRE>&quot;Any idea where to start?&quot;

Trying to get your app to work with Mono on Windows was a good first step.
I take it you can't make your app public, right? Or maybe try to make a
reduced test case?

&quot;If WebBrowser is not supported or converted is there any way round this?&quot;

I'm not sure what the best solution would be. But you could do something
like detect the OS, and if it's Mac, do something else (like using MonoMac
to use native widgets? May not be easy to make it work with WinForms,
though).

Talking about that, for the info, what the Mono team suggests doing is
having a different UI code depending on the OS, if you can afford it. Like,
have some kind of interface, and if on Windows, use WinForms, and if on Mac,
use MonoMac/Cocoa.
