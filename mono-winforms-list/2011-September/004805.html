<PRE>Le 2011-09-09 &#224; 10:39, Dick Porter &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-winforms-list">dporter at codicesoftware.com</A>&gt; a &#233;crit :

&gt;<i> Hi all
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been tracking down a display bug with winforms.  Basically, any
</I>&gt;<i> string drawn that has combining chars (eg accents) doesn't come out
</I>&gt;<i> right.  I've attached a screenshot and a sample test.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the screenshot the two buttons should look identical.  The only
</I>&gt;<i> difference is that the one on the left has text using a combining
</I>&gt;<i> accent, and the one on the right has the same text but using
</I>&gt;<i> pre-combined chars.  They're both valid utf-16; that is, it's not an
</I>&gt;<i> encoding issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's caused by libgdiplus using the cairo 'toy' text api to render
</I>&gt;<i> strings.  This API takes each character in turn, draws the glyph from
</I>&gt;<i> the font, and advances the drawing point by the width of the character
</I>&gt;<i> in the font.  The combining accent has a zero width, but by the time it
</I>&gt;<i> has come to be drawn the drawing point has already been moved so it
</I>&gt;<i> misses the character it's supposed to be combining with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've tried enabling the &quot;experimental and unsupported&quot; pango text
</I>&gt;<i> rendering support (see attached patch to get around the failed
</I>&gt;<i> assertion: (process:27402): Pango-CRITICAL **: pango_fc_font_lock_face:
</I>&gt;<i> assertion `PANGO_IS_FC_FONT (font)' failed) but am having font loading
</I>&gt;<i> issues when using the 'system' cairo (with or without pango), which the
</I>&gt;<i> pango support depends on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there any reason why the pango support can't be enabled by default?
</I>
Yes, it (presently, as is &quot;the last few years&quot; ;-) only support a
subset* of the features available with cairo so most applications will
regress if a switch was made.

* but it do support a few things that the cairo-based rendered does
not support (since the prototype was made to ensure it fixed those
things :-).

FWIW parts of the pango renderer needed to be re-written to use the
lower-level API to be able to totally replace (and augment) the
current (cairo) one.
