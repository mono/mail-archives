<PRE>Hello Vladimir,

I installed them using the packages I built yesterday, the URL is in the
first post.

&gt;<i> ( My installation put libraries onto /usr/local/lib directory, meantime as

</I>
That's because I installed them with RPM and the default for RPM is to
install to /usr.

&gt;<i> As much as I can see,  your mono runtime cannot see any dll at all.

</I>
I too thought that my setup was messed up. I am using Lluis, another
Mono hacker right now. He had an older revision of the RPM (rev. 2) and
the winform samples were working. I asked him to check the new RPMs and
after installing that, he gets the same error as I do too.

If you have a RH9 machine, please check the mono-wine packages in
