Subject: [Mono-winforms-list] WineLib or GTK#


&gt;<i>3. We want Mono to look like a solid framework; and supporting SWF 100%
</I>&gt;<i>is a VERY attractive feature.
</I>
SWF is so big and complex and so WIN32 API intense, Getting anywhere near
100% will be very difficult, even on windows. WINELIB is a long shot, GTK#
is probably impossible.

&gt;<i>4. GTK# already exists as a separate GUI and placing chunks of it into
</I>&gt;<i>SWF would seem awkward.
</I>&gt;<i>6. Parts of SWF classes in mono cvs appear to already have some WineLib
</I>&gt;<i>code in them.
</I>
We tried to concentrate on OS independent stuff early in the implementation.
At one point there was a gtk# variation of SWF in  its own directory. It
used the main SWF code as its base. Ximian programmers started this, but
switched to doing just GTK# without SWF after realizing the scope of the
problem. Anyone who really wants a GTK# based SWF can bring this back to
life (GOOD LUCK!). I think after Ximian abandoned the effort, no one has
committed even a single line of code.
