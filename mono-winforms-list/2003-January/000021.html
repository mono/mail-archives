<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; As said before, Winforms implemented with Wine is=20

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The other option that we have scratched is to build=20

</I>
Just my 2 cents, but I would much prefer a Winforms platform implemented
using native widgets that gets me, say, 95% compatibility with .NET than
one implemented on top of an emulation layer that *may* get me 100%
compatibility. Mono is going to have enough trouble playing catch-up
with .NET as it is. Adding WINE into the mix is just asking for more
headaches in the long run.

It is possible, and likely, that a large number of applications written
for Winforms will not require calls into Windows-specific APIs. For
these applications, it is both unnecessary and undesirable to require a
complete Windows emulation layer. Also, it is not unusual for
application developers to write some amount of custom code for each
different platform on which a given product is supported. In these
cases, it is arguably more desirable for the application to maintain
consistency with the native windowing system than compatibility with
low-level Windows-specific services that are not even being used.
