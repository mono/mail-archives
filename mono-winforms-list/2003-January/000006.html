<PRE>I don't have a great understanding of the structure of WineLib or the
ramifications of using it, but I think that is the way to go.  One of
the most important features of .Net in all of its flavors is binary
portability.  

While projects such as GTK# are important, I think the goal should be as
near 100% compatibility Windows/.NET as possible.  It appears as though
the major problems in using WineLib are (1) the aforementioned threads
problem, and (2) possible widget/theme issues.  I really can't say how
difficult either of these problems are but given the quality of
developers at work here, I can't believe they are insurmountable.  Once
these problems are addressed, many more .Net apps will run &quot;out of the
box&quot; on Mono, which is certainly what I am looking forward to.

</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm for a gtk# one. It wouldnt work with all apps, but hopefully a
</I>good
&gt;<i> &gt; chunk of them. And as more and more apps go .NET only, there will be
</I>&gt;<i> less
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of a need for P/Invoke.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again, the problem is not P/Invoke alone, but Wndproc method in
</I>controls
&gt;<i> as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The P/Invoke issue is a bad one, because it is required for things
</I>where
&gt;<i> there is no managed API (most third-party controls for .NET will use
</I>&gt;<i> P/Invoke).  So the Gtk#-based solution is a very partial one.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can not stress this enough: A Gtk#-based implementation would *not*
</I>be
&gt;<i> fully compatible, and people should be very very very aware that this
</I>&gt;<i> implementation *would require changes to their code* and would *not be
</I>a
&gt;<i> full implementation*.
