Hmmm.... I think, that a WineLib-based is better.
I am not a programmer - neither of Mono nor of any other project, but I 
think, that - from the point of view as user - a WineLib-based 
SWF-implementation is better.

Look at Gtk+2: One of the big changes from Gtk+1 is, that disposition/layout 
of the buttons have been changed. If there existing a &quot;ok&quot;-Button and a 
&quot;chancel&quot;-Button in a window, in Gtk+1, Qt, Windows, etc the &quot;ok&quot;-Button is 
on the left side. But in Gtk+2 and I think MacOS, there is it on the right 
side.

The idea of this toolkits is, that all programs with this toolkits have the 
same LookAndFeel. And so, there existing some rules, how a program must look 
like.
The SWF-LookAndFeel is the same like the Windows-LAF, because it is based on 
it.

If you now implement under Linux the SWF with Gtk#, then the 
Windows-programs have under Linux the GUI of Gtk+2, but it have partly the 
look of Windows.


An other point is, that without WineLib the SWF-inplementation is very 
incomplete.
Look at SharpDevelop. In SharpDevelop you can choose how the Menu looks 
like: Like Windows98 or like OfficeXP.
How would you with Gtk# take into account, that the OfficeXP-Menu looks 
different to to Default-Look?
