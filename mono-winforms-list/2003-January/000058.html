<PRE>Another 2 cents from me (another one that has done no coding, btw). When 
I managed programmers, I would always reprimand them for what I am about 
to discuss.


I had never tried running Wine before, so I gave it a shot. I run Gentoo 
Linux on a Thinkpad T23. Not a sluggish machine (unless I boot into XP). 
Anyway, I tried running a few applications on my Windows partition. The 
first thing that struck me was how long it took for the apps to start. 
Is this a concern to anybody? Do we want the Hello World GUI SWF 
application to start up the whole Wine machinery? Perhaps it goes faster 
if it has already been started (perhaps the Mozilla quick-start approach 
would work here).

So my cote again would be to code now with WineLib to get everything up 
and running, but during implementation think, design and code the SWF 
implementation with the idea in mind that the underlying implementation 
may be swapped at in the future. So as a previous poster said, we may 
have a SWF/Qt, SWF/Wine or SWF/Gtk.

Later,
Tyler
