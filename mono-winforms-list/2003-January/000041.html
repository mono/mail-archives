<PRE>I think Michael gives the best reasoning so far to use WineLib with
System.Windows.Forms.

Subject: Re: [Mono-winforms-list] Windows Forms.

Personally I see C# and mono as merely tools to allow easier development
of apps under linux.  Portability to windows is just a plus.  Basically
if SWF fails completely, mono will still be useful, especially in paving
the way to migrate from ASP.net under windows and IIS to Unix and
Apache.  So there is lots of point in .NEt under linux.  In fact, even
if and when Microsoft completely changes the specs to break
compatibility with Mono mono will still be a very useful thing.

If SWF is going to be attempted at all, though, a 100% compatibility
goal should be the target, so you are correct there.  I mean we already
have GTK# and QT# for those not interested in this type of
compatibility.

I'm far more interested in mature gtk and gnome bindings than SWF right
now.  But on the other hand, bringing sharpdevelop and other apps over
is very cool.  Since I don't really know anything about the complexities
of SWF or porting it, I can't really argue one method over another.  I
do think the look and feel issue is important, but not an immediate
concern.

Michael
