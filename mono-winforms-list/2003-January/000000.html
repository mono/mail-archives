<PRE>Hey guys,

    So we have a problem with Windows.Forms right now.  To test/develop
on Linux we need to get Wine to include support for a few semaphore API
calls.   

    As said before, Winforms implemented with Wine is required to have
full support for Wndprocs and P/Invokes, and is the right way of doing
things.

    The other option that we have scratched is to build Windows.Forms
using a native toolkit, because we would not be able to achieve 100%
compatibility.   

    Idea: it would be useful to have a Windows.Forms implementation that
used Gtk# at least to port existing Open Source Winforms code that we
could tweak or ifdef chunks of code.

    Opinions?

Miguel
