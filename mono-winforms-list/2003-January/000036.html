If a vote is done, I just hope folks rally around the decision and make
a united effort to get it done, and that those who didn't get what they
voted for don't decide to go another direction and resources end up
getting too fractured.  That would only slooooow things down.  As much
as I would like to not see a bloated, buggy winelib swf, in the end it's
probably the only way to get the highest swf portability.

Subject: [Mono-winforms-list] Vote?


Seems we're stuck with too many different opinions as to how the SWF
implementation on Mono should be written... May I suggest that someone
set up a voting system so random visitors on www.go-mono.com can tell ud
their opinion? I think this would be a good solution since it is people
who are going to use Mono in the end who are most interested in the
project and visits the site more often. A note could be sent to OSNews
about it, or something...
 
I was thinking that choices could be:
1. Pure Gtk#
2. Pure Qt#
3. Both (using the most appropriate for each system - this will take A
LOT of coding to do...)
4. WineLib implementation, providing full Win32 API support (if
possible).
 
Then we could measure &quot;common people&quot;'s opinions and take them into
consideration... Right now there seems to be an equal amount of
arguments for this and that, and I really feel we need to do something
soon - this is very frustrating :-)
I don't think it will matter much if we will have to make som huge
changes to the code that might come out of it at a later point, as long
as something is being done.
 
Yours sincerely,
Simon Ask Ulsnes, Denmark
