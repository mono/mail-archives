<PRE>Hi,

I hope you don't mind if I toss in my 2 cents. Personally I'm in favor of
using WINELib. I develop commercial software for Windows, and I can verify
that P/Invoke'ing to Windows libraries is essential to delivering our
software. 

If the only hold up to using WINELib is the GC issue, then I think the
solution is clear.

According to <A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/runtime.html,">http://www.go-mono.com/runtime.html,</A> under the &quot;Garbage
Collection&quot; topic, the Boehm GC will be swapped out in the future in favor
of a non-conservative collector, anyway. I don't know if this is still the
plan, but if so, the pthreads issue will go away down the road. 

Am I mistaken in the assumption that the only Mono dependency on pthreads is
the Boehm GC?

The idea (I think) is that with simple wrappers we can indeed use the
functions already in Wine.  The only thing holding back here is the problem
getting the Wine code and the Mono+Garbage Collector code to co-exist.  This
is because Wine has its own pthreads implementation which causes linking
problems for Mono because (although it's enough for the Wine code) it's
incomplete.  So the current position is that Wine can't use the standard
pthreads library, and Mono can't use a non-standard pthreads library.

I think.

Not at all.  I think it's important that everyone's clear on what each
solution would bring (problems, advantages and dependencies).
