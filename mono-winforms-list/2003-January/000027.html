I don't think that's quite what was meant.  As I understand it, the idea is
that we implement System.Windows.Forms so that calls to WndProc work (and
WindProc is a part of the System.Windows.Forms API, not a native call), and
so that P/Invoke to a standard Windows DLL (such as USER32.DLL) also works.
COM and native interfaces seems to be widening the scope of the discussion a
lot.

As you say, maybe we do just have different goals.  Personally, my ideal
would be that someone can install Mono and run a .NET application, even if
that wasn't what the developer of that application intended.  I can't see
that working in practice without either using WINE or effectively
re-implementing WINE and the Windows API.

&gt;<i> seems like it will just enable and encourage bad programming practice.

The more code I see, the more I agree with the phrase &quot;You can write Fortran
in any language&quot;.
