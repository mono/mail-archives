As I said, it's not as straightforward as it might appear.  Try it if you
don't believe me.

But as I said, that's not the point.  The point is not whether or not
developers _should_ be doing a DllImport, the point is that they _are_ doing
it.  And if we just say &quot;that app won't run because they didn't develop it
right&quot;, that will not lead to more people using Mono - it will lead to more
people using .NET on Windows, just because it works.
