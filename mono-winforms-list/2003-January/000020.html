<PRE>To achieve the greatest cross platform continuity there should be (IMHO)
something with SWF in it.
My personal opinion on this is - at the moment I dont care what it is so
long as I can get a decent mono IDE  on Linux and really start hacking.
Some people think it should be built on GTK# which is still a bit dynamic
and getting larger than mono by the minute...
There seems to be the thought that SWF has some wierd tricks whick make it
hard to run in non W$ but GTK has got round this problem.
Rather than burden (potentially) mono with a possibly overblown emulation is
it not possible to isolate the 'W$ event queue' (# this from GTK??) and
write an SWF using SD.
I'm not sure of the legal ramifications of this as SWF is not a standard??

There is a move by the #Develop  to port that to linux and it may be worth
thinking about building whatever is necessary to get that working under X11?
If you can put MicroWindows in 64k ........
