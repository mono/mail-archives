Seems we're stuck with too many different opinions as to how the SWF =
implementation on Mono should be written... May I suggest that someone =
set up a voting system so random visitors on www.go-mono.com can tell ud =
their opinion? I think this would be a good solution since it is people =
who are going to use Mono in the end who are most interested in the =
project and visits the site more often. A note could be sent to OSNews =
about it, or something...

I was thinking that choices could be:
1. Pure Gtk#
2. Pure Qt#
3. Both (using the most appropriate for each system - this will take A =
LOT of coding to do...)
4. WineLib implementation, providing full Win32 API support (if =
possible).

Then we could measure &quot;common people&quot;'s opinions and take them into =
consideration... Right now there seems to be an equal amount of =
arguments for this and that, and I really feel we need to do something =
soon - this is very frustrating :-)
I don't think it will matter much if we will have to make som huge =
changes to the code that might come out of it at a later point, as long =
as something is being done.

Yours sincerely,
Simon Ask Ulsnes, Denmark
