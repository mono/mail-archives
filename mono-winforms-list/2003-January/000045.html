<PRE>Hola,
I have been following this thread for a while and would like to comment.
I am a developer for the WINE project and for the ReactOS project so seeing a commong
Windows.Forms interface is very important to me. That being said I am not opposed to using GTK#
provided

1. Someone properly implements Win32-&gt;GTK themes 
2. Someone properly implements drag and drop in Win32-&gt;GTK

If you can make GTK# look and act like common controls and common dialogs in a Windows system then
go for it. I can assure you guys that at least on the ReactOS side we are working on supporting
mono so we will have a Open Source .NET. Even if it means we have to ship GTK, GLib and the WINE
dlls we have ported. If you guys cannot make it work &quot;RIGHT&quot; 100% of the time with GTK# then use
WINElib. Winelib is not going away anytime soon and it does what you need.

Thanks
Steven Edwards
