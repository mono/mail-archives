<PRE>Hey guys, how about this.

Perhaps we could get the guys working on the JIT engine to do something
like Apple does with OS9 applications on OSX.  If an OS9 application is
used on OSX, the OS9 environment is loaded up(a lot like Wine) to
service the application.

With our implementation, if the JIT engine finds dependencies to native
windows DLL's it could link to the Wine SWF dll, if all dependencies are
resolved of by linking to our GTK/QT/Whatever SWF dll it would use that
one.

Miguel is this possible?

I know this would make 2 different code bases and this is also putting
some hard-code into the JIT engine.  But it goes with what Tyler Wilson
was saying, it is like a step from DOS to Win16, and from Win16 to
Win32.  It also would make both sides of the road happy, and everyone
could code on what they would like to code on.

In the long run I would hope someone, if not us, will make a true
cross-platform native windowing toolkit for .NET, and that it would be
widely used on Windows and Linux.
