I agree with Simon, why force Wine to have to be used for winform apps
that may never really need &quot;true&quot; win32 emulation?  Why force the
overhead??  Somehow, make it optional for winform apps that require
wndproc and p/invoke to use wine winforms, but have gtk# available as
the default.  I know, easiar said than done, and trust me I wish I was a
systems programmer so I could help out, but I'm only an applications
developer.

Those arguing that Mono should use WineLib in the SWF implementation, do
they mean that to create a basic windows with controls on it Mono should
be interacting with the Mono libraries? Because that makes absolutely no
sense to me. (If it does, please explain why)
1. That would require every Mono/Linux desktop user to install Wine as
well to execute almost every CLR-program that he will come across.
2. It would require a lot of cooperation with the Wine devteam, which I
am sure have enough to do.
3. It would be such a waste of the Gtk# and Qt# implementations, since
noone will use them because then they will lose cross-platform
compatibility. When they're there, let's use them! I don't think it
requires many resources to write two SWF libraries on top of Gtk# and
Qt# respectively. (I would be happy to contribute in this, but it would
require me to get a lot more involved in how both Gtk and Qt works)
Basically, all the functionality has already been written (well, a lot
of it - Gtk# is at version 0.7!).
 
As far as the Gtk+2 layout issues are concerned, I don't think that will
be a very big problem.
 
Yours sincerely,
Simon Ask Ulsnes, Denmark
