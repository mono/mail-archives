I just wanted to say that I have programmed a few controls for my SWF =
applications, none of them required low-level Win32 API functionality!

The ReleaseCapture/SendMessage combination (used to make things =
draggable) I think is the most commonly used, and it can easily be =
replaced by some event handlers doing their thing...

I have not yet come across a single Windows Control that needed API =
functions. If you know any, please let me know...
Besides, I think that programmers that want to achieve cross-platform =
compatibility can cope with the fact that there is no Win32 API on a =
non-Win32 platform, and find another solution. (maybe we could publish a =
document describing how to make your Win32 API-calls pure .NET? I think =
it is possible in most cases.)

Right now, I think it is important to start getting some work done. I =
really miss some more documentation on the Gtk#-classes so someone (me?) =
could start writing classes and functions that act similar to the =
original SWF classes, which will be able to run some basic HelloWorld =
programs, testing controls and so on. As I said before, the details can =
be done later.
And I still don't understand why it is not possible to write a Gtk# =
implementation that links to the WineLib when needed. Maybe I'm stupid? =

I guess we have different goals for Mono, and specifically WinForms on
Mono. I envision Mono/WinForms as the successor to Java on the desktop.
Like Java, .NET has the potential to become a vehicle for deploying
cross-platform applications. Unlike Java, Microsoft is not going to do
everything it can to prevent it from succeeding.

In Java, while it is possible to write code that makes calls to native
APIs, it is generally not necessary, and is often discouraged. The JDK
was designed to minimize or eliminate the need to do so for all but the
most performance-intensive tasks. The .NET framework is similarly
designed, which leads me to believe that the development philosophy
would also be similar. Basing the fundamental design of Mono/WinForms on
the need to support a particular platform-specific API (e.g. COM) seems
like it will just enable and encourage bad programming practice.
