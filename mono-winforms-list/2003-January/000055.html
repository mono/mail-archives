As I understand it, it's not that the Wine folks don't want to use a
complete pthreads implementation, I think it's just that for technical
reasons they need to use their own threading implementation (they need more
internal control over it) and so far they've had no reason to make it
complete as far as pthreads goes.

I imagine that if they were given the extensions required to make their
existing threading pthreads compliant they'd be happy to use it, since it
would allow Wine to be used by Mono (and other programs that need to link to
pthreads) just by introducing some functions that they wouldn't otherwise
use.  It's just that (again as I understand it) implementing those
semaphore-related functions would require a fair bit of knowledge of the
Wine internals as well as threading experience, and there aren't many
candidates to do it.
