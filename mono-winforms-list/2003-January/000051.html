<PRE>Simon,
	No offense, but I think you've stepped over the line of
discussing an issue, and into the realm of being a trouble maker.  At
this point I think this thread has gone down an unhelpful path.  Paolo
makes a good point, however harsh it may sound, that making a &quot;real&quot;
contribution to the code is what really matters as far as opinions go.
With that said, since I've made no contributions, I'm more than willing
to simmer down, and not make trouble for the guys who are doing the real
work, which by the way, I am very grateful to.

-Dan

Isn't Wine an emulator (although Wine Is Not an Emulator :-) technically
speaking? I think it would be kind of wrong to have the whole SWF
namespace
running on top of the WineLib, then again on top of the native windowing
system, on top of the X server, on top of the host system. I think we
should
avoid as many layers as possible.

Isn't Wine Open Source? Would it be possible to &quot;strip&quot; the functions we
need from the WineLib and modify them to our needs? (that is not a good
solution, I know)
Or will it not be possible to convince the Wine developers to use the
standards pthread implementation? Or will it not be possible to somehow
exclude all objects linked to the WineLib from the garbage collecting
done
by Mono?

Paolo Molaro &gt;&gt; Arrogant Open-Source-programmer attitudes will not help
anyone making a better Mono! Unfortunately, in this case, we need to
build
something that will actually run and which is able to do it good enough
for
people to use the technology. Programming should be done by those who
are
good at it and those who feel like it, preferably both... Only stable
and
adequate code will succeed in the real world.

Personally, I have never succeeded in making Wine work on any Linux
installation I've run, including Red Hat 8.0 which is my current. I'm
quite
convinced that I've configured it correctly, it just won't run any Win32
apps from my Windows XP (NTFS) partitions, especially none using MFC.
(sure,
I've made tiny console apps work, but they're not to much use)

Yours sincerely,
Simon Ask Ulsnes, Denmark

&gt;<i> I agree with Paolo and James that GTK theme layer with winelib makes
