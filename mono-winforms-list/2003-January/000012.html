Those arguing that Mono should use WineLib in the SWF implementation, do =
they mean that to create a basic windows with controls on it Mono should =
be interacting with the Mono libraries? Because that makes absolutely no =
sense to me. (If it does, please explain why)
1. That would require every Mono/Linux desktop user to install Wine as =
well to execute almost every CLR-program that he will come across.
2. It would require a lot of cooperation with the Wine devteam, which I =
am sure have enough to do.
3. It would be such a waste of the Gtk# and Qt# implementations, since =
noone will use them because then they will lose cross-platform =
compatibility. When they're there, let's use them! I don't think it =
requires many resources to write two SWF libraries on top of Gtk# and =
Qt# respectively. (I would be happy to contribute in this, but it would =
require me to get a lot more involved in how both Gtk and Qt works) =
Basically, all the functionality has already been written (well, a lot =
of it - Gtk# is at version 0.7!).

As far as the Gtk+2 layout issues are concerned, I don't think that will =
be a very big problem.

Yours sincerely,
Simon Ask Ulsnes, Denmark
