Some time ago I put my hand up for adding GTK+ theme support to Wine. As
I understand it, that really should make everyone happy.

I spent some time planning exactly how to do this, spoke to a lot of gtk
developers, read a lot of the mozilla source amongst other things.
Making wine look like GTK is not a difficult problem -- unfortunately I
haven't had time to sit down and write the code that's floating around
in my head (isn't that always the way? :)).

I really believe that if the argument comes down to &quot;it won't look right
but it will work&quot;, then it's a no-brainer. The &quot;wine looks odd&quot; problem
is a different one entirely and it's not overwhelmingly difficult to
solve.

James.

(btw, if anyone is still interested in pursuing the GTK theme for WINE
thing, let me know)

</I>&gt;<i> Tom,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Being a Windows developer myself, I can tell you that the issues of
</I>&gt;<i> implementing WndProc and the Windows message stream in a compatible
</I>&gt;<i> fashion are bigger than you imagine.  It is very often the case that
</I>&gt;<i> components developed for Windows will make use of WndProc and trap
</I>&gt;<i> messages to do things that the framework doesn't have support for.
</I>&gt;<i> Implementing WM_MOUSEMOVE is pretty easy on a native widget set.
</I>&gt;<i> Implementing a message such as LVM_ENABLEGROUPVIEW on a control that
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't even exist on a widget set will be quite another story.  There
</I>&gt;<i> is a reason why the WINE group has worked so hard for so long to get
</I>&gt;<i> compatibility, it's not easy.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the goal of Mono is to run as many .Net apps as possible, then Wine
</I>&gt;<i> is the right approach.  The one downside is that it will still appear as
</I>&gt;<i> a half-baked solution when these apps have no clue where they are
</I>&gt;<i> running and don't play ball with any Gnome or KDE desktop themes or
</I>&gt;<i> actions.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To achieve the greatest cross platform continuity there should be
</I>&gt;<i> (IMHO)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something with SWF in it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My personal opinion on this is - at the moment I dont care what it is
</I>&gt;<i> so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; long as I can get a decent mono IDE  on Linux and really start
</I>&gt;<i> hacking.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Some people think it should be built on GTK# which is still a bit
</I>&gt;<i> dynamic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and getting larger than mono by the minute...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There seems to be the thought that SWF has some wierd tricks whick
</I>&gt;<i> make it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hard to run in non W$ but GTK has got round this problem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Rather than burden (potentially) mono with a possibly overblown
</I>&gt;<i> emulation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it not possible to isolate the 'W$ event queue' (# this from GTK??)
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; write an SWF using SD.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not sure of the legal ramifications of this as SWF is not a
</I>&gt;<i> standard??
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There is a move by the #Develop  to port that to linux and it may be
</I>&gt;<i> worth
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thinking about building whatever is necessary to get that working
</I>&gt;<i> under
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; X11?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you can put MicroWindows in 64k ........
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Tom
