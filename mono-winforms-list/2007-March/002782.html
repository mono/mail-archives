<PRE>Hi all,

I've just download, compiled and tested latest from SVN. We had several 
problems, many of them regarding to the list view, which are now fixed.

But the bad news is: the tree view is broken (it doesn't even show up), 
there are many problems on form resizing (our wizard was working correctly 
two weeks ago or so and now is totally broken).

I could try to file all bugs, but it is maybe easier if somehow we can 
collaborate, maybe making some testing ourselves weekly, maybe giving you 
Plastic to test... I don't know.

Maybe it will also help if somebody (I would do it myself) could check the 
fixes before they are integrated (branch per task would greatly help here... 
:<i>-P )
</I>

Thanks

pablo
