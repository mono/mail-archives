<PRE>Subject: System.Windows.Forms NullReferenceException under Wine

Hello, and thank you for your hard work.  I'm impressed at how strong mono
has become!

While using windows for a month, I tried out a game (luvinia, an mmorpg). 
I'm back in Linux and would like to continue.

In my current attempt, I ran the game's installer with mono 2.10.6 (running
on wine 1.3.15 within Ubuntu 11.04).  When I run the installed program, it
correctly renders the login screen, pauses roughly 0.3 seconds, then the
login window vanishes.  The console outputs a NullReferenceException in the
System.Windows.Forms code.  I've enclosed the console output, in case that's
useful.  A few minutes after the window closes, there is still no console
activity, so I hit ^C, which causes the last three output lines.

Is there a (not cost-prohibitive) way for me to circumvent this Exception,
or am I stuck?

The program is *not* open source.  When I posted to the game's bug-reporting
forum, I was told very clearly that Linux was not supported and I would find
no help.  I've searched Google and the mono forums but didn't see anything
relevant.

Thanks very much for your time.
