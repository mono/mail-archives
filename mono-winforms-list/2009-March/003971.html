<PRE>Hey,

Sorry for the late report, but my laptop died last week. See Bonus ;-)

Accomplishments:

* Bug fixing [Partially done] - Spent some time trying to figure out how to
solve #413898 without breaking several tests. Also, work on other bugs.
* Activation stuff [Partially done] - Applied suggestions by Andreia to some
activation patch, basically.

Objectives:

* Keep up with old stuff.
* Get a new laptop ;-)

Bonus:

* Basically on the last wednesday my laptop completely stopped working, and
had to take it to some technician (guarantee is over), and managed to get a
borrowed laptop here and install all the needed stuff. I was waiting till
Monday in night for the lap report, so I could probably recover some of my
patches and ongoing work -and commit it-, but it seems the hard drive of is
broken too, so even if the things I was working on are not hard to remember,
I still need to re-code them.

Carlos.
