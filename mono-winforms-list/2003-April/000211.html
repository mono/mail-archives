<PRE>&gt;<i> Mike (and other Wine lurkers out there) maybe you might have a contact
</I>&gt;<i> we need for this? 
</I>
See the &quot;Support for pkgconfig&quot; thread on wine-devel for a discussion of
the issues involved with Wine integration without using WineLib.

There isn't really a contact as such, if the changes are acceptable then
I think Alexandre would accept them, but he has pretty high standards.
The other main problem is that Wine sees binary compatability (ie being
able to run windows exes) as more important than being able to directly
link against Wine and use its sources from Linux.

If you could give a summary of your changes, how you avoid the need for
WineLib pthreads etc, that'd be good.

thanks -mike
