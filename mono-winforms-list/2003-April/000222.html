<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> &gt; The problem is that other people can not do the diff, only you know the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exact version that you used as a base.   So it is much more convenient.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why to do not just compile the code  from my tarball and copy the required
</I>&gt;<i> files into required places (or symlink them). I see this is not convenient,
</I>&gt;<i> but
</I>&gt;<i> this is only for now. later all will be taken on their places.
</I>
The issue is not with the compilation Vlad, the issue is that people on
the list need to understand the changes, and they need to discuss those
changes, to come up with a plan.

How to integrate it?  Where to send patches?  Will Wine take all the
patches?  Which patches they wont?  What is controversial?  Can we use
the same build?  Can Wine users have two builds?

As you can see there are plenty of open questions, and we need to
discuss those issues.  Hence our need to have patches.

Miguel
