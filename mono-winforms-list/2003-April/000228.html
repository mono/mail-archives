<PRE>Hello!

&gt;<i> I think this made diffs with all files, which are absent in directory with
</I>&gt;<i> my modified wine,
</I>&gt;<i> but present in native wine
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually my new wine is much less and is cut down for required directories
</I>&gt;<i> only.
</I>&gt;<i> so  for instance -  I have 7 dlls, but native wine - much more - 83 !.
</I>&gt;<i> Mono does not need them (at least for now)
</I>
Am glad that you got diff working, those are good news.

Now, to be able to move forward, the best way to approach this is to a
list of your changes, so we can maintain these changes until all of them
have been integrated into Wine proper.

To achieve this, it is important that Mono users be able to:

	* Download a pristine and official Wine release.

	* Apply the Mono patch.

	* Build and install (possibly to a different prefix, if needed)

To reach that goal, we should not trim down Wine and distribute a
trimmed down wine, because that would force upon us the maintenance of
it, which we are not ready to do.

Could you hence recreate the missing files from the original
distribution, or apply your changes to a pristine Wine, so we can get a
usable patch?

Miguel
