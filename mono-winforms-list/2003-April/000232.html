The changelog is being prepared. 

&gt;<i> How to integrate it?  Where to send patches?  Will Wine take all the
</I>&gt;<i> patches?  Which patches they wont?  What is controversial?  Can we use
</I>&gt;<i> the same build?  Can Wine users have two builds?
</I>&gt;<i>

We will produce a tarball with patches and a build script to make the
shared objects. While the code is not included in Wine tree, we'll have
to maintain the patches and they will be based on a Wine snapshot.

Current development is based on 20030318 snapshot. When there are
significant changes/improvements in Wine we'll migrate the patches up to
be based on some newer slice of time in Wine history ;)

We live in the hope that in time this code would be included in wine
tree but until that may happen I don't see an alternative to this.

I think for now Vlad could maintain the patches. Should we have a place
in mono winforms CVS for them?

The shared objects should live in peace and harmony separate from an
existing Wine build so people who want to live on the bleeding edge with
Wine proper should be able to do so. What will be needed is a patched
wineserver running in different port, under a different name. 

&gt;<i> As you can see there are plenty of open questions, and we need to
</I>&gt;<i> discuss those issues.  Hence our need to have patches.
