Hello &lt;g&gt;

&gt;<i> Maintaining this &quot;small&quot; fork will be a pain. Under the hood wine already
</I>&gt;<i> contains some new important changes and because of those your work can be
</I>&gt;<i> redone. The latest distributions (rh9, mdk9.1 and others) use glibc 2.3x combined
</I>&gt;<i> with nptl. All this new stuff breaks wine and the latest wine version is
</I>&gt;<i> needed for it. (needs to be compiled using --with-nptl). So the patches already
</I>&gt;<i> need an update and there needs to come a way to compile with or without nptl.
</I>
Forking the Winehq tree is going to be a PITA untill they tag 0.9 They are trying to lock down
tools and options for a 0.9 and a 1.0 release but you still may have some major problems forking
until then. I know this as I have done it for a while with the ReactOS fork of the wine programs
tools and libs. If you have to fork your code because Alexandre wont take your patches then
someone needs to do a proper CVS-branch and sync it with CVSup or something like that.

Thanks
Steve
