<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> 1. Is System.Drawing under Mono hardware accelerated and thus will SWF 
</I>&gt;<i> Rendering under Mono be accelerated as well? I'm asking because I know 
</I>&gt;<i> Java Swing, and even today you cam &quot;feel&quot; the difference between a 
</I>&gt;<i> native GUI and a Swing app?
</I>
The slowdown in Swing is probably related to other factors (Swing is
over-engineered, so even the simplest applications require hundreds of
objects to be coordinated).

That being said, Windows.Forms in Mono uses System.Drawing, which in
turns uses our GDI+ which in turn uses Cairo, which in turn will be
hardware accelerated with Glitz which uses OpenGL to do the heavy
lifting. 

&gt;<i> 2. How are you planning to integrate with the Host OS in terms of Look. 
</I>&gt;<i> I can imagine a SWF app with the XP style looking a little out of place 
</I>&gt;<i> under Mac OS - Aqua? Is there anything going be inherited by the host OS 
</I>&gt;<i> like titlebar, menu etc?
</I>
There is an interface that can be implemented.

Miguel
