<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> For compiling mono I used this:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.all-the-johnsons.co.uk/mono/mono-compiling.html">http://www.all-the-johnsons.co.uk/mono/mono-compiling.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Only some steps didn't work for me:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Download of the svn / cvs source with
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.all-the-johnsons.co.uk/mono/monoupdater.sh">http://www.all-the-johnsons.co.uk/mono/monoupdater.sh</A>
</I>&gt;<i> only worked for the mono-source but didn't work e.g. for cairo.
</I>
Have you got CVS installed on your machine? cairo/libpixman require a 
cvs client to work. No cvs, no download.

&gt;<i> After this I tried to install libgdiplus but this also didn't compile.
</I>&gt;<i> For some reasons I missed some includes src/gdip.h.
</I>&gt;<i> I added:
</I>&gt;<i> ----------------
</I>&gt;<i> #include &lt;fontconfig/fontconfig.h&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> #include &lt;ft2build.h&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> #include FT_FREETYPE_H
</I>&gt;<i> ----------------
</I>&gt;<i> after this it compiled a few more files but stopped because of some
</I>&gt;<i> warnings. I looked into this and because the warnings looked hamless I
</I>&gt;<i> removed the -Werror from the Makefile. Thats it!
</I>
Out of interest, which version of freetype and gcc are you using? Under 
FC3, I've not come across this problem at all.

&gt;<i> After this step I compiled mono. It looks like 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;make monolite-bootstrap&quot; don't work any more but a simple make did the
</I>&gt;<i> trick.
</I>
Correct - it is detailed on my website, but it looks like the readme 
file inside of the mono source is telling porkies... It won't be the 
first time that a readme has been unreliable, probably won't be the last 
either ;-)

&gt;<i> There is a big test program (FormsTest.cs) that I could compile (after
</I>&gt;<i> deleting some parts of the UpDownTest) but  NullReferenceException is
</I>&gt;<i> raised after the start:
</I>&gt;<i> --------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> done detecting keyboard:  German keyboard layout
</I>&gt;<i> #region #line XplatUI Constructor called
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unhandled Exception: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not
</I>&gt;<i> set to an instance of an object
</I>&gt;<i> in &lt;0xab8f1&gt; (wrapper remoting-invoke-with-check)
</I>&gt;<i> System.Drawing.Font:ToHfont ()
</I>
Looks like something has been either stubbed or there is a problem. Have 
you got the URL (or can you email me the source off list) and I'll check 
it on this system? It could be something or nothing.

That said, not everything has been implemented, so errors are quite 
possible.

Glad to see my site is useful. It's in the process of being updated so 
those unfortunate enough to use IE instead of something which actually 
works will be able to access things easier... CSS + IE == 
recipe_for_disaster!

TTFN
