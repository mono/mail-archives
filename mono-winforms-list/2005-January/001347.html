<PRE>Fantastic Work! Thank you!

Looks great and runs very well already. I've commited the 'propertygrid' 
testapp to winforms (<A HREF="svn://svn.myrealbox.com/source/trunk/winforms">svn://svn.myrealbox.com/source/trunk/winforms</A>) which 
allows to look at TextBox properties (I found a bug in TextBoxBox with it, 
even).

I took the libery of reformatting a bit (replacing your 4 space indentations 
with tabs (tabs = 8 chars wide) and added a few regions to match with the 
rest of MWF and I've commited it to svn. I also put two checks in (look for 
'PDB' in the PropertyGrid code) to make it work with the test app in 
winforms.

Please keep up the great work and keep those patches coming!

Cheers,
  Peter

Peter (and everyone else),
Here are the beginnings of a property grid. Before I get too
much further along, please take a look and give any advice. I'm using
the label, toolbar, and textbox controls where I thought appropriate.
Note that the GridEntry.cs file belongs to propertygridinternal;
everything else goes under system.windows.forms.

Thanks,
Jonathan

Jackson was kind enough to dig up this list of classes:
<A HREF="http://www.dotgnu.org/pnetlib-status/System.Windows.Forms.PropertyGridIn">http://www.dotgnu.org/pnetlib-status/System.Windows.Forms.PropertyGridIn</A>
ternal.html

Since it's internal and undocumented we don't have to worry too much
about
matching it, but maybe the names help you designing.

You can simply put the code you need into the document classes as
private or
internal (or if you need a support class, that's ok too, as long as it's

internal), you shouldn't have to worry about PropertyGrindInternal.

Oh, and as tempting as it may be, please don't use ildasm (or similar
tools)
against Microsoft's SWF.dll to find out what's in that class, it would
taint
you (and your contribution).

Cheers,
Peter

Peter,
I'm making progress on the PropertyGrid. However, a lot of code
lies in System.Windows.Forms.PropertyGridInternal. There is essentially
no documentation for this (not a listing of the classes in the
documentation or the object browser in VS.NET IDE). Any advice?

Thanks,
Jonathan

Peter,
I plan on signing up for the property grid control. Give me a
few more days and I'll post what I have. Hopefully, you can take a look
and give me any advice.

Thanks,
Jonathan

Our goal is to be complete by end of February 2005. (I am ignoring
DataGrid
for this statement).

If it's technical questions that make you reluctant to sign up for
implementing, don't be. We'll be happy to answer any questions you may
have
and guide you through.

Cheers,
  Peter

I was planning on doing more than stubs, but I don't know if I am ready
to
sign up for 'implementing' the control. I'll give it a shot, and try to
post
the beginnings of something back here sometime next week.

Is there any sort of time length associated with completing a control,
other
than the roadmap (it lists windows forms as a Q4 2004 item)?

Thanks,
Jonathan

Please no stubs. To avoid some past mistakes and problems we won't
accept
stubs for SWF. It does not safe any time for the person who will
implement
it, creates a false impression of completeness and therefore bogus
bugreports, and invites to do incomplete implementations. Please read
the
Guidelines in the Managed.Windows.Forms directory.
Unless I missunderstood you and you want to implement the control, which
would be awesome!

Peter

Is anyone working on the Property Grid Control? I will take a look at
stubbing together some code if nothing is done.
