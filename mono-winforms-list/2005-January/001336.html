<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> I apologize. Your original message slipped through.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've looked in the zip file, and it seems that the control is based on 
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft's code and it includes a license from Microsoft which requires, 
</I>&gt;<i> amongst other things, to include the license in any distribution in it's 
</I>&gt;<i> original form. I have to check with smarter people if we can include this 
</I>&gt;<i> into MWF, since the license as a few requirements, and does not look like 
</I>&gt;<i> it's just the MIT/X11 license that MWF is licensed under.
</I>
Sadly, this would make our entire library be licensed under the subset
of both licenses, and it also happens to be incompatible with the GPL,
so we are unable to put this code into our tree.

</PRE>
