<PRE>Hi guys,

I made some changes to my month calendar control, so that multiple date
selection (like text selection) is done using the mouse move event
instead of the timer approach i had previously.

Previously I was using a 10ms timer to detect the mouse's position to
see if it had selected any new controls, however i have since changed it
to only check the mouse selection on mouse move (if the mouse is
clicked).

The control works the same, except now it updates the selection much
slower than when I had the 10ms timer running.

Should I:

a) check in my changes so someone else can test it
b) revert back to the 10ms timer for selection
c) something else ??

JBA
