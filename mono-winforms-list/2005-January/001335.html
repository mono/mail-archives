<PRE>I assume that you have downloaded the original DateTimePicker.msi where the
EULA can be found.

Otherwise it inside the

cker.zip Archive.

The original MS code was a very basic Compac version that would only work on
a US-Machine - not even in Canada (English or French) did it work.

The original Demo-Exe fails on my Machine when the DateTimePicker is called.

But I suppose license is license (that is why I included the original .msi
in my Archive), but I hope that the &quot;smarter people&quot; will know what is right
thing is to do.

As you wrote the MS license must be included - but otherwise it is also very
clear that you can do any thing you want with it.
