<PRE>Just to make sure I understand this correctly:

&gt;&gt;<i> Sadly, this would make our entire library be licensed under the subset
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of both licenses, and ...
</I>
The fact that the starting was point was the MS version
And that changes were made to :
- make it work
- add functionality to work the same as the Desktop Version 
  - which the original code did not 
- add multiple Language (CultureInfo) support

Still bound it to the conditions of the license?

Would it help to contact Microsoft to get this version released from these
conditions? I would try that if worth the effort.

&gt;&gt;<i> it also happens to be incompatible with the GPL,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so we are unable to put this code into our tree.
</I>
Is that a license problem or the fact that there is more functionality in my
version than the original Desktop version of DateTimePicker?
