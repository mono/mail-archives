<PRE>Hi,

Bit of an odd one here which I'm not sure if it's a mono issue, a .NET
issue or a problem with OOo exporting RTF.

If I create a file in OpenOffice and save out as RTF, I can load it
happily into a RichTextBox and the fonts, font size and colours are
quite happily kept.

If I create a formula in OOo equation editor and save that out as an
RTF, this will load into the RichTextBox, but nothing shows up. Is this
a limitation in RichTextBox or an issue with OOo which needs to be
reported? I've not tried to export a formula from Word.

TTFN
