Hi,

I have a RichTextBox. If I create a file in OpenOffice and save it out as
RTF, it imports happily into the control, with all of the fonts and sizes
and colours and justifications completely intact.

However, if I create an equation using the OOo Equation editor and export
that, it isn't imported or if it is, doesn't show.

Is this a problem with OOo RTF output, the RichTextBox, mono or is it
designed not to take it? If it's an OOo problem, could someone with Word try
and create a formula, export as RTF and bring it into a RichTextBox? I can
then eliminate .NET and file a BZ against OOo.

TTFN

Paul
