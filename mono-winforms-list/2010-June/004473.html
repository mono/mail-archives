Ok the first problem that I found was that the selection made with the mouse
doesn't update the selection lenght variable so if one tries to get the
current selected font or color it just returns null
I found that there are several references to this variable but not that much
so I just got rid of all the references to this var and instead used
SelectionLength method and it worked.

Now I'm having formatting issues.
I trying to fix this issues but its kind of hard doing it because I don't
really understand the desing behind the RTB and text controls

One example is that there are empty tags that are useful to set formating
properties when no text is selected but for me this is useless because
theres is a caret tag and the format should be applied to the caret if
nothing is selected and when something is typed it should inherit the
caret's current format.
If the caret is move it should get the current position format.
In this way the memory usage is improved and less code is needed reducing
the desing complexity

Its been a couple of weeks since I'm trying to understand the design. I hope
someone here could shed some light about this and at the end we will end up
with a bug free RTB

I also found that  RTB's code coverage is not very good because all the test
pass with out errors even with this issues.
