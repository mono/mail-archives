<PRE>Hi,

I'm developing a user interface for a project which is targetting both
Mono and MS .NET which is based on a port of an old RISC OS application
called MultiShow2 (the name describes what it is - it displays images
and video). 

The problem is this.

In the original, there was a central window and a pane which was either
underneath or to the right of the viewer window. It was attached to the
main window (move the main window, the pane moved). 

If the window was the same size as the screen area, the pane would move
inside of the window.

I've googled this problem but can't seem to find what I'm looking for.
Does anyone know if it's possible and if it is, can you point me in the
right direction to do it?

Thanks

Paul
