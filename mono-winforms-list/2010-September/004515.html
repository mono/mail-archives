Hi,

1) Sure. However, note that WinForms is currently buggy on OSX, but the rest
should work fine. Until there is a worthy WinForms driver for OSX, I suggest
you use GTK# or Cocoa (through MonoMac, for example) instead, for example.
Only consider WinForms on OSX if your app is simple enough. On a side note,
it's possible to use an alternate X11 WinForms driver on OSX by passing a
command line parameter (requires an X11 server install on the Mac), which
apparently works better than the Carbon-based driver. (Sorry if this is all
a bit confusing.)

2) It depends on what you do. If you just wanted to check out how your
WinForms or GTK# app runs on OSX, there is no need to &quot;port&quot; anything, and
no need to recompile either. But if you want to do OSX-specific code (like
using MonoMac), then it's a different story.
Also, some people want to have a custom UI for OSX (usually using some kind
of Cocoa C# wrapper), which means more (duplicate, OS-specific) work, while
others don't want to bother and are happy using a cross-platform GUI toolkit
instead (which looks less good / native on OSX, but may still work fine).

3) I don't think there are any Mono books that are recent enough to be
interesting.
