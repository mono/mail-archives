<PRE>&gt;<i> Our company is willing to contribute code to the SWF project. 
</I>&gt;<i> We hope to be able to draw in support from other commercial entities. 
</I>&gt;<i> Initially we have assigned one developer, Vladimir Kaluzhny
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="mailto:vkaluzhny@openlinksw.co.uk">vkaluzhny@openlinksw.co.uk</A> ), more or less full-time for this. He has
</I>&gt;<i> extensive experience in working with native Win32 API as well as other
</I>&gt;<i> GUI toolkits. My bosses have tasked me to act as a liaison between
</I>&gt;<i> our developer team and this project.
</I>
Sounds great :) Remember there may be people on the mono/wine lists you
can hire as well, if you wish to get external experience.

&gt;<i> To make patching a bit less laborious process, I'd like to discuss
</I>&gt;<i> things regarding encoding in files stored in the CVS.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right now I see mixed use of DOS-style CR/LF linefeeds and Unix-style.
</I>&gt;<i> Do you think it possible to switch to using one of these exclusively?
</I>
I noticed this too. It'd be nice to use UNIX style, that way you don't
end up with lots of ^M characters at the end of each line.

-WINE_LIB=/usr/lib/wine
+WINE_LIB=/usr/local/lib/wine

This is clearly going to be an issue. I'll fiddle with pkg-config and
submit a patch to wine this afternoon hopefully to make detection of
where wine is installed to more automatic.

thanks -mike (a wine lurker on this list)
