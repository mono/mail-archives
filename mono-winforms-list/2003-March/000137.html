<PRE>Hello!~

&gt;<i> The differences are:
</I>&gt;<i>  - fixes to header files;
</I>&gt;<i>  - configure script and Makefile.in to build GC for Wine
</I>&gt;<i>  - additional Wine-specific files required for build
</I>
Could you post a patch file between the standard and the new GC?

I do not quite understand the header file fixes, they seem to be
casing-related.   

I looked at the changes and it seems like there is a new `configure.ac'
file and a new Makefile (generated by Wine maker), and I am wondering if
we could incorporate the configure changes into the existing
configure.in, and the Makefile changes as well.

When Paolo gets back, we should investigate having our own copy of libgc
into the repository (this is something that we have talked about in the
past, and it seems like now is a good time to do it).

&gt;<i> The main problem is configure. Version for Wine and original
</I>&gt;<i> version are different. I wanted to create gc-wine.mak from 
</I>&gt;<i> Wine version of Makefile to include it in standard GC 6.1 
</I>&gt;<i> distribution or place configure etc. files to a separate 
</I>&gt;<i> folder within the distribution. But none of this is ready
</I>&gt;<i> for a moment.
</I>
You mean the `configure' file?  That file is typically automatically
generated by the `autoconf' program.

Miguel
