<PRE>Oh no, you did nothing wrong. The time I can put into this project is
limited so I was glad to see some of these issues resolved.

I would now like to put some more work into the class library. Are there
any available control classes to work on?

Thanks,
John

John,

Sorry if I did something wrong, I didn't know that
you are working on this. The file in CVS was relatively
old and the functions were disabled.

Thanks a lot for the GC for Wine and monogc, I am looking forward=20
to set them up and run SWF applications with GC enabled Mono.

This is great news! This is quite an accomplishment. I have been trying
to get Wine to work with the Boehm garbage collector. I was taking the
same approach you did with the sem_ functions matching
scheduler/pthread.c from the Wine project but you definitely made more
progress on this than I was able to.

I was able to get the Boehm GC library to compile and install under
WineLib by making some minor changes to the header files and source. The
#ifdef's basically were not aware of _LINUX and _WIN32 being defined at
the same time. Running winemaker in the gc6.1 directory then generated
the configure;make install scripts. I have this for download at:
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/john_sohn/gc6.1-wine.tar.gz.">http://www.geocities.com/john_sohn/gc6.1-wine.tar.gz.</A> Running the
./configure;make;make install on this project will then install the
Boehm GC WineLib DLL into the Wine environment.

I also added monogc.c to the latest monostub application in CVS which is
attached to this message. With these changes I was able to get the
latest monostub application to work with garbage collection enabled. It
may be possible to get the monostub and GC-enabled Mono to work without
these changes but currently it segfaults for me. I think there is still
some work required but perhaps this can be of some of use.

John
