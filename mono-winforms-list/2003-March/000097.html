Great, we really need some sort of support from the Wine developers to
get things working smoothly.

This is the biggest problem; currently we have a clash:

*) wine provides the win32 API and it's own implementation of pthread
*) mono provides a (very limited) subset of the win32 API and it _uses_
the pthread implementation

The clash between the the win32 APIs has been solved in mono with a
link trick, IIRC.
Then we have the issue with the pthread API: currently the issue, I
think, is that mono uses some pthread functions not implemented by wine
and they are currently stubbed to allow the dynamic linker to work.
Having all the needed pthread functions in wine will solve some
immediate problems, but in the long run I don't think that's the way to 
go, because it still assumes we have to run some mono applications
through mono and some through wine monostub (and it won't be possible to
dynamically load assemblies that depend on libwine).

What I think can solve the problem is to have a libwine build that
doesn't include any of the normal emulation stuff, but just what is
needed to provvide the drawing and windowing API. I guess there may be
several dependencies issues and it may not be easy to do: we'd like the
input from the wine developers on this.
Note that if only those chunks of code are included, we would be able to
dynamically load the modified libwine when the System.Windows.Forms
assembly is referenced and there should be no need for the separate
libpthread implementation or the %fs tricks wine needs to provide to
execute windows binaries.

Cheers.
