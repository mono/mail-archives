simple really :) Presumably the entries will be in the next release of
mono rpms?

Well, the SWFTest program dies with a .NET exception inside splitter.cs
but you probably know about that. I get these errors at the start of
every app, but they don't seem to cause problems:

I know we don't implement UXTHEME yet. The SH* functions might or might
not be in wine. There are a few others that I thought we had, but
perhaps not. 

Anyway, they can be implemented as and when we need them.

&gt;<i> monostub/monowinehooks are integreated already.
</I>&gt;<i> The only thing left - libgc. Hopefully, this will be inside soon.

Excellent work! :)
