<PRE>Dear colleagues;

We regret the inappropriate tone and lack of topical content of this
message. This is in no way an appropriate introduction and in no way
reflects any view on behalf of OpenLink Software. We apologise for the
disturbance.

We shall provide detailed technical rationales and references for our
contributions where appropriate/requested.

We shall also provide details of testing environments, etc. And will for
the time being focus on getting the mono Winforms to operate with Wine.

Regards,

Yrjänä Rankka
