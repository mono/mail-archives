<PRE>Hi,

Thanks for the details. Though I don't think I completely understand the 
second issue
(XIM event order matter), I am persuaded. Your patch is in svn (along 
with my patch
of course too).

I'm also getting into libX11 code, so if you have pointers to relevant 
sources (probably
in src/xlibi18n/* or modules/im/* ?) please give us them :)

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The first problem has to do with the tracking of the control, shift, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and alt key. These keys will currently get &quot;stuck&quot; because if 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> FosterParent filters the key release event, a key release event for 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> these keys are never put on the hwnd Queue. For example, if you press 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> CTRL-space to enable an IM, winforms still thinks the control key is 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> still pressed, even after you release it. Using the left and right 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> cursor keys to move around a input field will move a word at a time, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> rather than a letter at a time.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ah, good point! It should be fixed too. But I somewhat doubt if your 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> change
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> especially that KeyRelease event is always passed works fine.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It could result in inconsistent key event processing (KeyPress could be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> filtered and KeyRelease always isn't) and such inconsistency trapped me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> couple of days. So, IMHO there should be some condition to determine
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whether to filter KeyRelease or not.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> Key filtering is totaling at the whim of the IM. If the the IM processes 
</I>&gt;<i> a key event it will tell the calling procedure the event is filtered. I 
</I>&gt;<i> am assuming you mean there should be a condition on whether we should 
</I>&gt;<i> process a key event in winforms even when the IM has filtered the event. 
</I>&gt;<i> If so, then you are correct. I think my patch currently works because 
</I>&gt;<i> few apps use key release events and so dual processing by both the IM 
</I>&gt;<i> and winforms is not an issue. However keypress events for mod could be a 
</I>&gt;<i> problem if the IM filters event. The keypress event would never be 
</I>&gt;<i> processed by winforms and thus the key state would never be registered. 
</I>&gt;<i> In this case we cannot do dual processing of all keypress events. So 
</I>&gt;<i> some condition needs to be determine as to when we pass the key press 
</I>&gt;<i> and key release events onto winform.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, winforms currently relies on key press and key release 
</I>&gt;<i> events to track the modification key states. Perhaps it is enough to 
</I>&gt;<i> test if the event is a key press or a key release mod key event (alt, 
</I>&gt;<i> ctrl, shift, menu, etc) and then pass the event on to winforms for 
</I>&gt;<i> processing even if the IM filters the event. The only other alternative 
</I>&gt;<i> I can see is to redesign winforms so that it queries X for the current 
</I>&gt;<i> state of the modifier keys whenever it needs that information.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The second issue has to do with the way that IME compose messages are 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> handle. A bit of background is required here. I am one of the authors 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of KMFL (kmfl.sourceforge.net), which provides Tavaultesoft Keyman 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> services to Linux. The way KMFL is designed is that KMFL can generate 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> multiple compose messages in response to a single key stroke. The 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> problem is that XIM does not use a FIFO to queue XIM compose 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> messages, but a stack. So unless XIM compose events are processed 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> immediately upon receipt, the recipient window will receive the XIM 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> compose messages in the reverse order that they are generated. The 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> fix is rather easy to implement. We just allow the application to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> process the keypress messages upon receipt rather than queuing a 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> whole bunch and then returning. Note that the GTK XIM connector and 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the QT XIM interface work correctly with KMFL, so they implement a 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> similar solution.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not sure what you meant here. Do you mean such event processing 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like below
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could happen? :
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - KeyPress for 'A' occurs, and then it is stored in X event queue 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ... well, &quot;stack&quot; ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      as pending.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - KeyPress for 'B' occurs, and then it is stored as pending.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - XNextEvent() is called, and X returns KeyPress 'B' because it is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not FIFO.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> This is sort of what happens. It has been awhile since I poked around 
</I>&gt;<i> the XIM code in X. I just went back to familiarized myself with the 
</I>&gt;<i> situation. The actual problem is with the XIM commit code in X11. Here 
</I>&gt;<i> is an example of what actually happens:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. The user presses 7. The input method is to generate the string 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;seven&quot; in response to this. The IM will actually generate each 
</I>&gt;<i> character as a separate compose event. I realize that in this case the 
</I>&gt;<i> IM could have generated one compose event containing the string &quot;seven&quot;, 
</I>&gt;<i> but this is not always the case. The way the kmfl engine is designed, it 
</I>&gt;<i> needs to be able to generate separate compose events in response to one 
</I>&gt;<i> keypress.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. The IM calls the XIM commit callback to commit the first letter &quot;s&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 3. The XIM commit callback pushes the commit string on the IC commit 
</I>&gt;<i> info stack and then fabricates a KeyPress event with a keycode of 0 and 
</I>&gt;<i> pushes this event onto the event queue. Control is then transfered to 
</I>&gt;<i> winforms.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. winforms receives the fabricated event and puts the event onto the 
</I>&gt;<i> hwnd queue via UpdateMessageQueue (UpdateMessageQueue was called by 
</I>&gt;<i> GetMessage).
</I>&gt;<i> 5. UpdateMessageQueue then calls XPending and XNextEvent in a loop to 
</I>&gt;<i> get the next event. XNextEvent passes control back to X which in turn 
</I>&gt;<i> passes control back to the IM.
</I>&gt;<i> 6. The IM calls the XIM commit callback to commit the second letter &quot;e&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 7. Steps 3, 4 and 5 are repeated.
</I>&gt;<i> 8. Steps 2, 3, 4 and 5 are repeated for the rest of the letters. Note 
</I>&gt;<i> that the IC commit info stack now has &quot;neves&quot; on it.
</I>&gt;<i> 9. Control is now passed back to winforms GetMessage. GetMessage calls 
</I>&gt;<i> Keyboard.KeyEvent to process the first fabricated keypress.
</I>&gt;<i> 10. KeyEvent calls LookupString which in turn calls Xutf8LookupString. 
</I>&gt;<i> Xutf8LookupString returns the first compose sequence off the C commit 
</I>&gt;<i> info stack, in this case &quot;n&quot; which is in turn sent to the app via 
</I>&gt;<i> SendImeComposition.
</I>&gt;<i> 11. Step 10 is repeated for each of the compose character and thus neves 
</I>&gt;<i> is sent to the application.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Gtk and Qt of course have different event processing model from 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> winforms, so it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be just that the issue with kfml does not occur. I'm not sure 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your change is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> valid from our perspective (UpdateMessageQueue() may have to lookup 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> every X
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> events; I have no idea as I'm just digging into winforms only for XIM 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support ;).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure I understand. Every event is still processed by 
</I>&gt;<i> UpdateMessageQueue. Just not in a loop for keypress events.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Besides I'm not sure why giving up processing pending event 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> immediately in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> UpdateMessageQueue() could fix the situation. To my understanding, events
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are anyways retrieved as LIFO (if I believe you) and if kfml anyways 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regenerate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other messages as a result of KeyPress, they will be retrieved 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> immediately
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anyways, won't they?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> What my patch does is remove step 5. Control is passed back up the chain 
</I>&gt;<i> to GetMessage and thus Keyboard.KeyEvent to pop the commit string off 
</I>&gt;<i> the commit info stack before the IM and X can put another commit string 
</I>&gt;<i> onto the stack.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> There is a third issue, the importance of which is debatable. For 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> other frameworks (QT, GTK), each window in an application gets its 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> own input method, independent of the other windows in an application. 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> For example, in a text editor, even though you enable the input 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> method, for the main editor, the IM is not enabled for the search 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> box. This may not seem important at first, but it can be an issue for 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> multilingual application where different fields can have different 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> input methods associated with them. The patch I created last November 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> did support this feature; however it does add a lot of complexity to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the mix.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hmm, I don't think Windows Forms allow such input method switching.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It just controls whether IM could be enabled (default) or not. Of course
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it is possible to have different XICs for each window but I doubt we have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any configuration point (other than custom configuration, environment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> variables or whatever).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> Winforms itself does not allow for such switching but an IM framework 
</I>&gt;<i> such as SCIM does. For example, I could have one field in which I want 
</I>&gt;<i> to type IPA characters and another field in which I want to type Greek. 
</I>&gt;<i> I enable the IM for the first field and switch to the IPA keyboard. I 
</I>&gt;<i> then switch to the second field and enable the IM and switch it to 
</I>&gt;<i> greek. For other frameworks such as GTK and QT, if I click on the first 
</I>&gt;<i> field, the input context is automatically switch back to IPA.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Stimulating stuff. Hopefully we can address these issues and come up 
</I>&gt;<i> with a working solution.
