Yes, what I applied was what you have provided (I believe):
<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-patches/2008-March/113937.html">http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-patches/2008-March/113937.html</A>

For now I'm fighting against other preedit modes (preedit position
and preedit callbacks), so let me think about it later.
It seems that iiimx and/or atokx3 (Japanese commercial IM) has this
kind of issue; it does not change keyboard's shift state, unlike
scim(-anthy).

&gt;&gt;<i> I'm also getting into libX11 code, so if you have pointers to relevant 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sources (probably
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in src/xlibi18n/* or modules/im/* ?) please give us them :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These are the relevant sources. XIM is not an easy protocol to get your 
</I>&gt;<i> head around. I peppered the xorg code with printf statements to get a 
</I>&gt;<i> feel for the flow of processing.There is documentation at 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://xorg.freedesktop.org/archive/X11R6.9.0/doc/PDF/.">http://xorg.freedesktop.org/archive/X11R6.9.0/doc/PDF/.</A> This is for 
</I>&gt;<i> version 6.9.0 but XIM has not changed much for version 7.3 Xorg 
</I>&gt;<i> rearranged the documentation for version 7 and so there are no PDFs 
</I>&gt;<i> readily available for the internals of 7.3. I have generated pdfs from 
</I>&gt;<i> the postscript file available with the source if your are interested. 
</I>&gt;<i> However you can download the PDFs for 6.9 have have virtually the same 
</I>&gt;<i> thing. The docs you would interested in are xim.pdf, XIMTransport.pdf 
</I>&gt;<i> and i18nFramework.pdf. There are other docs dealing XKB which might be 
</I>&gt;<i> useful but not specifically applicable to XIM. The docs are very low 
</I>&gt;<i> level. I have not really found a good overview of XIM on the net.

</I>
I've also generated xim.pdf from xim.ps ;-)

Solaris IM implementation detail was also nice to read (it works on top
of IIIMF and hence it does not always apply to my environment though)
<A HREF="http://opensolaris.org/os/project/input-method/documents/SolIM_Impl.pdf">http://opensolaris.org/os/project/input-method/documents/SolIM_Impl.pdf</A>

When I solved the puzzle around preedit mode and XVaNestedList, I
will have to come back to these docs. Probably I had better commit
my ongoing changes to ask for review on what would go wrong.
