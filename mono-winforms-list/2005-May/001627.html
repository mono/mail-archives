<PRE>	Yes, I'm using double buffering in the property grid now. With
the change to Control.cs to support double buffering it was easy, as
well as changing the code to override OnPaint instead of WndProc.
	I've done a decent bit of .Net development, but very little
native linux development. I'm trying to draw the control as efficiently
as possible but seem to run into quirks in System.Drawing (which is
forwarding calls to unmanaged code). Any advice for debugging unmanaged
code on Linux? I've been spoiled by my years of using the Visual Studio
IDE on Windows.

Thanks,
Jonathan

Yeah, I had a look at it when you originally posted, but since I
couldn't=20
test at the time (working on richtext), it slipped my mind. Thanks for
the=20
reminder. I just committed a modified version, one that doesn't redraw
the=20
whole clientrectangle bitmap every time, but only the exposed area.
Thanks for catching this! I'm guessing you're using now double-buffering
in=20
PropertyGrid? Cool.

Cheers,
  Peter

Anyone take a look at this patch? I'm planning on checking in some
updates to the propertygrid, and this patch would cause redrawing of the
control to work correctly.

Thanks,
Jonathan

Sorry about the message flurry. XplatUI.PaintEventEnd(Handle) wasn't
being called in quick repainting logic.

Thanks,
Jonathan

The first patch is valid. The second is not. The logic looks like it
still needs fixed (when should needs_redraw be set to false), but my
solution does not seem to be working...

Also, the setting of 'needs_redraw =3D false' (line 3181) should be =
moved
outside of the if block. Notice that it can never actually get inside
the if block, since that is the only place needs_redraw is set to false.

      I noticed that support for double buffering has been included in
Control.cs. This is nice, except that I think the two calls to DrawImage
(lines 3177 and 3195) should pass ClientRectangle as the second
parameter, rather than ClipRectangle of the paint event args. According
to MS documentation, and actual behavior,  &quot;The image represented by the
image object is scaled to the dimensions of the rect rectangle.&quot;
      Thus with the code as is, the code as is draws the ImageBuffer to
the ClipRectangle. When the clip rectangle is the entire control, this
makes sense. However, when the clip rectangle is just part of the
control (like when a partially obstructing window is removed) the whole
control is drawn to the clip area. (I can send an image if anyone wants
to see).

Thanks,
Jonathan
