<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mwf.mono-project.com/">http://mwf.mono-project.com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Latest date which present at root page is [28. January 2005].
</I>&gt;<i> This cite looks like there is no mwf development.
</I>&gt;<i> Its blog has same problems.
</I>
We moved most content to the Wiki in February-March, we should probably
add redirects on mwf.mono-project.com.

Since Jan 28th, 2005 there have been 338 commits to the mailing list,
and also the following release statements have been made since that
release, these are copied from the Mono release notes:

	Extensive progress on the Windows.Forms support code since
	the March 18th release.  Jackson wrote a new double-buffering
	framework to bring our implementation in line with the
	expected behavior.

	Databinding is now supported on this release (simple and
	complex data binding), not all controls are ready though,
	controls that support it: ListBox, CheckedListBox and ComboBox
	(Jackson and Jordi).
	
	Alexander Olk implemented the file dialogs and did various
	touch-ups to other dialogs and widgets.

	Complete widgets: ImageListStreamer (Jackson),

	Prototype widgets: DataGrid widget and data container
	widgets (Jordi) and RichTextBox (Peter)

	Windows.Forms continues to improve in every part of the
	toolkit.  In addition to Jordi, Peter and Jackson's ongoing
	contributions, Alexander Olk contributed various of the common
	dialogs code; Jonathan Chambers contributed the Property Grid
	widgets and Geoff Norton continued to maintain the OSX driver.

&gt;<i> 1.1.7 release under windows has same problems as 1.1.6
</I>&gt;<i> (no RichEdit, bad background clearing,strange items in Forms.controls list 
</I>&gt;<i> (my application thinks that there must be only that objects which the 
</I>&gt;<i> application add in it, but some of them has but type and casting throws an 
</I>&gt;<i> exception, the application works under MS winforms fully correct))
</I>&gt;<i> Image.FromStream - is also absent (i hope 1.1.8 fixes this bug too).
</I>
As you can see from the release notes RichEdit is still in prototype
mode.

The best thing to do is to file a bug report for every problem you are
aware of, so we can properly track this issue.
</PRE>
