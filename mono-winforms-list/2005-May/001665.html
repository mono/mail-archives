<PRE>I'm not sure what you mean by palette support missing, but I'm guessing 
you're talking about saving with less than 24bit?

Jonathan Gilbert created a patch in March (you can search the list archives 
for details), that was supporting that, however, since it seemed to break on 
big-endian systems it never made it into svn. I don't know the current state 
of it, but his latest version can still be found here: 
<A HREF="http://israel.logiclrd.cx/patch/">http://israel.logiclrd.cx/patch/</A>

Maybe you (or Jonathan if he reads this) can resurrect the patch and we can 
get this finally wrapped up. I'd love to have this commited, but I lack the 
equipment (and time) to test &amp; finish it myself.

Cheers,
  Peter

Subject: [Mono-winforms-list] Pallete modes for libgdiplus


Good day.

It seems, that at this time there is no support for pallete (8-bit and
1-bit) images in libgdiplus and so in System.Drawing. Does somebody work
for it? Or is it planned?
If there is no activity for this task, I can make it and supply the
patches. This functionality is hardly needed for my project.

Thanks.
I hope this is the correct list for such discussion.

</PRE>
