<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> yes, the TextBox in .NET is not so fast either, but I'm satisfied with the performance .NET's RichTextBox. 
</I>
In Windows case, the control is most likely a native control that comes
with a C# wrapper.

&gt;<i> It's good that you prefer to make things work, although I'm pretty
</I>&gt;<i> happy with the latest mono version. All controls I use work really
</I>&gt;<i> good (except TreeView and RichTextBox). I think you're not far from
</I>&gt;<i> the point you should think about some cosmetic and performance issues
</I>&gt;<i> to increase the acceptance of mono. But that's my extern opinion. My
</I>&gt;<i> client is not very happy about that (Rich)TextBox issue, but that's
</I>&gt;<i> not high prio resp. not so important I think.
</I>
As Rolf said, our goal right now is to be correct first, and since there
are still various areas that need to be corrected we are not likely
going to be able to spend much time on these cases in the immediate
future.

But the beauty of open source is that if this is important to your
customer you can work with him to study the performance problem, find
out the hot spots and if things go well, submit patches to improve the
performance.   This has been done repeatedly in Mono.

&gt;<i> Mono's progress in the past year was amazing - today I think that it
</I>&gt;<i> was a good decision to choose it in early 2006.
</I>
</PRE>
