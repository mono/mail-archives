<PRE>Hi,

I'm developing an application for school and college teachers in the UK
which allows them to keep track of lessons, timetables, trips and the
such. Much of the design is done, but I have a problem.

The simplest method for the timetable itself is a TableLayoutPanel with
a border to see what lesson on what day is being taught (so it's like a
grid).

Using SharpDevelop, if I double click on the grid, it defaults to the
Paint event for the panel - what I need it to do is to launch a child
window and then display the results in that cell.

I'm thinking of saying that if the click was between x, y, x1 and y1
(the bounding box for the cell), open the window and paste the results
back in (create a big label or something similar, resize and add).

This has a drawback in that the timetable has to be flexible enough to
add extra lessons (not all schools do 5 lessons a day) or breaks and
lunchs, so the bounds of the cells can't be hard coded, therefore, I
need to be able to find the cell boundaries. I can't find anything in
MSDN which says how to do this.

Second to that is that if I add a label on the fly then need to edit
that label, will a simple click event work for a label (I'm not sure if
they have them)?

TIA

TTFN

Paul
