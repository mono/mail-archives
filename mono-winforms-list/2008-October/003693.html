I see myself as a typical user. maybe im not that helpful &amp; and faithful guy
to Mono. but as a user i am obserbing the path this project is going as the
only source of cross-platform .NET . i mean the people in mono project
should ask themselve why they are doing that. in reality multi-platform java
already been there. why anybody or organization  (not typical me) should
bother themselve for a product full of bugs in a world with tight
competions?!
