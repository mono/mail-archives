<PRE>I don't think there is any &quot;get cell at point&quot; method for TableLayoutPanel.

What you could do is go ahead and fill each cell with a blank label that 
has a click/doubleclick handler.  That way, you don't have to worry 
about translating the click to a cell, as the click would occur on the 
label instead of the table.

</I>&gt;<i> I'm developing an application for school and college teachers in the UK
</I>&gt;<i> which allows them to keep track of lessons, timetables, trips and the

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The simplest method for the timetable itself is a TableLayoutPanel with

</I>&gt;<i> grid).

</I>&gt;<i> window and then display the results in that cell.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm thinking of saying that if the click was between x, y, x1 and y1
</I>&gt;<i> (the bounding box for the cell), open the window and paste the results
</I>&gt;<i> back in (create a big label or something similar, resize and add).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This has a drawback in that the timetable has to be flexible enough to
</I>&gt;<i> add extra lessons (not all schools do 5 lessons a day) or breaks and
</I>&gt;<i> lunchs, so the bounds of the cells can't be hard coded, therefore, I
</I>&gt;<i> need to be able to find the cell boundaries. I can't find anything in
</I>&gt;<i> MSDN which says how to do this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Second to that is that if I add a label on the fly then need to edit
</I>&gt;<i> that label, will a simple click event work for a label (I'm not sure if
</I>&gt;<i> they have them)?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> TIA
