Hello! This is my first post here. I'm following from a long time Mono's
development and I'm really excited with Mono 2.0's release, since it runs
many of my software just fine. However many of my applications are based on
weifen luo's DockPanel suite, a freeware library that provides a VS-like
interface. Unluckily, this library relies on P-Invokes to work, so I'm
looking for all-managed freeware replacements that provide that
functionality.

I have found the DockDotNet library on sourceforge and it is fully managed
and it almost works on mono. I don't know much about Mono development, but
it would be nice if some of the Mono hackers can try it and fix the problems
that it has on this platform. Its source code seems far from perfect, but it
could be the starting point for a managed advanced UI library that would
benefit many applications out there.

If this turns out doable porting complex apps to mono would be much simpler,
or maybe I'm missing other free libraries that already provide a cross
platform VS-like interface?
