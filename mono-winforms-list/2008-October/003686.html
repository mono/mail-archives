Well, although Mono isn't as stable as Java, it has the obvious advantage of
letting many existing .NET apps work on Linux and Mac with little to no
change. That certainly takes less time than remaking the app in Java (which
would probably have other disadvantages once done, too).

As for me, the path I'm going to take is forking my code a little bit for
Mono to work around annoying bugs. I made a &quot;IsMono()&quot; function that lets me
change the program behavior when needed. Actually, I even do it the other
way around too, by adding hacks specifically for the MS .NET framework which
Mono doesn't need (if (!IsMono()) ...), because Mono is actually less buggy
on a few particular things. That said, I'm keeping hacks to a minimum.
Forking is a quite good trade off, in my opinion. In my case, it's much less
hassle than forking my sites to work with IE, for example.
