Hi all

I've created an application which stores WinForms in XML files (using
Reflection, TypeConverter, etc..).
Additionaly, I've created also some custom controls (e.g. a knob) which I
also store in the before mentioned XML file.

I'm trying now to port this application to mono. The MoMA returned no
problems and the application itself is running fine under mono. But when I
try to open one of my XML files with a knob, the application crashes with no
message. This however doesn't happen for all kinds of controls, for some it
is working as expected, for some not.
I tried to gather more information using the &quot;2&gt; error.log&quot; argument from
the tutorial when running mono but the error.log remained empty.
I've also tried to set up MWF according this tutorial: 
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Guide:_Debugging_With_MWF">http://www.mono-project.com/Guide:_Debugging_With_MWF</A> Guide: Debugging With
MWF  but i was not able to compile it because the assembly
Mono.Webbrowser.2k5 was missing and I didn't find the according assembly.

Could you suggest me something what i could do next?
Any help will be much appreciated.

Thanks
/moudi
