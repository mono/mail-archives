<PRE>It's being worked on. But there are some larger design things that need to =
be solved, that's why there's little visible progress.

Cheers,
  Peter

I thought most of the system.windows namespace was un-done.

It would be nice if someone got it done, seems everyone only cares about we=
b
apps in the mono project.

Subject: [Mono-winforms-list] WinForms not working with simple programs

The answer to my question is probably &quot;RTFM&quot;... but if it is, *please*=20
point me toward a manual that explains this.  I've been searching for=20
hours and can't find an answer.

I installed Mono from CVS and set up wine, following the instructions on=20
the Mono web site.  I successfully compiled a simple WinForms app using=20
mcs (one that I had previously run on .NET), then tried to run it with=20
Mono and had strange things happened.  I got errors saying
&quot;err:menu:MENU_GetSysMenu failed to load system menu!&quot;
a blank form was displayed, and a box popped up on top of that form that=20
said:

&quot;The application has produced an exception.  Press 'continue' if you=20
want the application to try to continue its execution.
An exception was thrown by the type initializer for System.Drawing.GDIPlus&quot;

This box had three buttons (which appear to be blank until I click on=20
them): Stack Trace, Continue, Quit.  Clicking &quot;Stack Trace&quot; causes the=20
message &quot;Control notification Code 0 Id =3D Hwnd 65595&quot; to appear in the=20
console.  Clicking &quot;Close&quot; makes the form and the popup box go away, but=20
the app is still running in the console.  Clicking &quot;Continue&quot; makes the=20
popup go away, and another one appears saying &quot;GdipCreateFromHDC&quot; and=20
these messages appear in the console:

&quot;err:menu:MENU_CopySysPopup Unable to load default system menu
err:menu:MENU_GetSysMenu failed to load system menu!
err:menu:MENU_CopySysPopup Unable to load default system menu
err:menu:MENU_GetSysMenu failed to load system menu!&quot;

After hours of searching, the only thing I could think is that I was=20
using features that weren't implemented, so I downloaded this example=20
from the Mono wiki:

<A HREF="http://www.nullenvoid.com/mono/wiki/index.php/The%20TextBox%20Control.">http://www.nullenvoid.com/mono/wiki/index.php/The%20TextBox%20Control.</A>

It did the same thing, except that instead of a blank form it had the=20
text boxes as shown in the screen shots (same error messages, same popup=20
on top of the form).

My system:
Red Hat Fedora Core 1
AMD Athlon XP
Mono from CVS
Wine from rpm mono-wine-20030318-1.ximian.6.1.i386.rpm

BTW, I'm able to run console &quot;Hello World&quot; apps just fine, but when I=20
try Gtk# or Gnome# apps I get &quot;Unhandled Exception:=20
System.DllNotFoundException: libgtk-win32-2.0-0.dll&quot; and &quot;Unhandled 
Exception: System.DllNotFoundException: libgobject-2.0-0.dll&quot;  I know 
this problem is OT for this list, but I just thought I'd include it just 
in case the problems were related.  When I tried fixing this, the only 
information I found said it was problems with /etc/mono/config, but I 
checked mine and it matches what the other postings I read said it 
should be.

Thanks in advance,
Wayne
