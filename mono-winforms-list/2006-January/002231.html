<PRE>Greg,
 
I haven't had much luck with the win forms implementation.  I always get a
SIGSEV when my application exits.  I also get lots of gdi plus exceptions
when using System.Drawing with embedded resources (toolbar bitmaps, etc.),
and I have not yet found a solution.  So yes, there's a good chance that
what you are seeing is simply a bug in the implementation.  Sorry I can't
give you more constructive help.

erraticbehavior



Hi Everyone, 

 

I am new to the mono project and am trying to get it working for my current
project.  I have been able to write a basic windows form application and
that works well, but when I try to use an mdi form, it gets kind of funny on
me.  I have included links to the screen shots for the difference, video so
you can see the behavior, as well as the code.  

 

Basicly, the code is: 

Form1 oForm = new Form1(); 

oForm.MdiParent = this; 

oForm.BackColor = Color.White; 

oForm.Show();

 

When I create a few child forms and then close the mdi form I get the
following in the command prompt that I used to start the program: 

 

Mono System.Windows.Forms Assembly [Revision: 54007; built: 2005/12/6
14:35:24]

 

=================================================================

Got a SIGSEGV while executing native code. This usually indicates

a fatal error in the mono runtime or one of the native libraries

used by your application.

=================================================================

 

Stacktrace:

 

in &lt;0x4&gt; (wrapper managed-to-native) System.Drawing.GDIPlus:GdipDisposeImage
(in

tptr)

in &lt;0xffffffd8&gt; (wrapper managed-to-native)
System.Drawing.GDIPlus:GdipDisposeIm

age (intptr)

in &lt;0x10&gt; System.Drawing.Image:DisposeResources ()

in &lt;0x13&gt; System.Drawing.Image:Dispose (bool)

in &lt;0x10&gt; System.Drawing.Image:Finalize ()

in &lt;0xf0a2488&gt; (wrapper runtime-invoke) System.Object:runtime_invoke_void
(objec

t,intptr,intptr,intptr)

 

This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual
way.

Please contact the application's support team for more information.

 

I don't know if I am doing something wrong, or if there is something that I
am missing, or if the implementation is incomplete and what I am seeing is a
bug.  Any help or advise anyone can give me would be greatly appreciated.
