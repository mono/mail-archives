<PRE>Thank you for your respond.  You are right that I am using
&quot;Form.ShowDialog&quot;.  However, I am using it in both Windows, and Linux.
The reason I am using &quot;Form.ShowDialog&quot; is because I want to monitor for
the return of the form.

Is there a problem with &quot;Form.ShowDialog&quot;?

Thanks.

-Tri.

As far as I know there's no bug in Form.Show, so my guess is that you
call Form.Show on Windows and changed it to Form.ShowDialog while
porting to Linux which would explain the behavior you mentioned.

However I you are sure that this is not the cause for the behavior, then
please file a bug with a repro at <A HREF="http://bugzilla.novell.com.">http://bugzilla.novell.com.</A>

Kind Regards,

P.S. I cc'ed this message to the winforms list, so that more people
concerned with WinForm will notice to this issue.
