<PRE>I'd like to ask if there is anyone on this list who can help with deployment of VB.Net WinForms apps to OSX/Linux.  We'd like to
work with a few people familiar with Visual Studio 2005 off list and in the end publish back to the Mono Project the results of the
work for the benefit of others.
 
Alternative platform deployment is very new to us, but we're willing to put in the time and effort to learn, if we can get some help
navigating our way through the process of testing, debugging, and packaging our apps (they already work under Windows, but may need
tweaking to work elsewhere).
 
We understand that WinForms 2.0 is not quite complete within Mono, but trust that it's close and coming along, and that we'll
probably find some bugs along the way which we'll report as appropriate.
 
Thanks in advance.
