<PRE>Awesome, we love people who fix the bugs they find!

Generally a bug is opened in bugzilla and the patch is attached to it. 
This makes sure they don't get ignored on the list and are trackable. 
But if they're pretty minor, I can probably take them from the list and 
make sure they get committed.

Ideally, each .patch file will contain all the files for one 'bug'. 
That allows us to commit and test each change independently.

So maybe &quot;bug one&quot; patch file has changes to:
Form.cs
ChangeLog

and &quot;bug two&quot; patch file has changes to:
Control.cs
ThemeWin32Classic.cs
ChangeLog

Go ahead and patch the ChangeLog with your message saying what was 
changed and why (what it fixes) following the format of other messages.

If possible (and things like cosmetic changes aren't), it's also nice to 
provide NUnit tests that ensure the issue is fixed and never creeps back in.

Thanks for your help in tracking these down and providing fixes!
