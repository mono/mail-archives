<PRE>Hi,

I'm pretty new to Mono so hope you can help - the company I work for has
a .NET 1.1 Winforms app which it hosts inside a browser. Obviously this
needs .NET to be present on the client machine, and it only works with
IE. Is Mono likely to offer an alternative to this - ie. using the same
app DLL and running it inside Firefox, say? 
If so, I'd be grateful for any links - if not, then I guess it's off to
port to some other environment...

Best wishes,
Julia
