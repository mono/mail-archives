<PRE>Hey,

While trying to fox bug #324513, I notice that trying to scroll a control,
which has bigger bounds than any of its Parents controls, shows some drawing
issues.

Example: you have a VScrollBar with Height &gt; than its contaning form:

  __________
  |        |          | &lt;- This is the form (Parent)
  |____|_____|
           | &lt;- This is the scrollbar

This is because when we try to scroll a windows, we copy some area of it and
invalidate the 'new visible' one.
But we assume that the entire control is visible (that all its Bounds are
painted and available to scroll). But it's not the case in this case, where
the VScrollBar is not entirely visible,
because it's parents Bounds don't contain it.

The attached patch tries to detect all the non-visible regions of a control
(top, bottom, right, left) and then check if whe are trying to scroll part
of the non visible area,
which then is invalidated.

Carlos.
