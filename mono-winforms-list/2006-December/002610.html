Nice, the things you mentioned (Padding and TextImageRelation) are not 
implemented at all (Neither in button base nor in the ThemeWin32). But at 
least I got the padding working right now. TextImageRelation comes next since 
it involves a lot of drawing-work to be done.

&gt;<i> Thanks very much for tackling this and your persistence.

No problem this is a good opportunity for me to learn how it is to write a GUI 
and it is a much better &quot;under-the-hood&quot; experience than just looking at the 
source. :-)

@Miguel:
First thanks for your review and now just a short comment. I personally like 
writing &quot;this.&quot; in front of my members. In my opinion it makes source more 
readable since you can easily distinguish between instance member and local 
variables, but I guess that's my personal flavor and if it's not conform to 
the Mono coding guideline I'll stop writing it.

Kind Regards,
Valentin S.
