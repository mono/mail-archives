<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> I belive that there are bugs and limitations that should not be copied. For
</I>&gt;<i> example Mono runtime accepts 2.0 IL code in 1.x assemblies that is
</I>&gt;<i> definitely incompatible with MS.NET.
</I>
This is probably a bug on the runtime as well.

But it could also be said that we are lax in accepting a corner case
(that is highly unlikely to happen in the wild), while bug compatibility
on Windows.Forms is *very likely* to happen in the wild.

For your runtime example: only a hand-constructed IL file would possible
run into this &quot;feature&quot; and it would have to be something done on *Mono*
and later attempted to be ported to Windows, which market-wise speaking
is very small.

While the expected behavior of Windows.Forms is something that a vast
majority of .NET developers do use and tend to rely on.  These people
used the API in some form or another and worked around those limitations
in one way or another.  

We want to keep the list of differences to a minimum between .NET and
Mono for the .NET APIs, I do not want to come up with a large volume of
&quot;Things to look for when porting between platforms&quot;.
</PRE>
