<PRE>Hi guys,

Over the weekened I implemented and checked in changes to the MonthCalendar that
(hopefully) optimise the way the control is painted and invalidated, as well as
enable click-drag date selection.

It seems to make a difference to my machine, but things always run slowly on my
machine so I can't be sure if that's the cause or not.

Anyhow, I would love to get some feedback from anyone who has the time to test the
Monthcalendar about it's paint responsiveness and any selection bugs (which I hope
aren't there). For those that have the time to check it out, use the
winforms/monthcalendar sample and test on the second row of calendars (cause it has
a max selection count of 400 or so).

Thanks in advance.

JBA

P.S. This is the first control i wrote for MWF from scratch, so it's quite possible
that I may have done some things wrong, and I am quite open to constructive
criticism and tips :)
