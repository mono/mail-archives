<PRE>Paul,

Yeah, we are aware of those issues. We run into them every day yet it seems 
that there's always something more pressing to be worked on. I've had to 
resize my test app's window for the last 4 weeks to make my edit control 
show up, you'd think I'd have it fixed by now :-) Often, though, I keep the 
problem around until I have time to look into and fully understand what's 
happening, to make sure the 'fix' isn't just a 'workaround' that's hiding 
the real problem.

Peter

Subject: [Mono-winforms-list] Windows not the correct size


Hi,

I'm using MWF from the development branch of mcs here and have hit upon
a problem, which, IIRC occurs even in the normal branch.

If I have something like the following

using System;
using System.Windows.Forms;

namespace WelcomeGUI
{
   class Welcome4
   {
      static void Main( string[] args )
      {
         MessageBox.Show( &quot;Welcome\nto\nC#\nprogramming!&quot; );
      }
   }
}

This compiles fine and starts up as a small window with nothing in it at
all. If I expand the window slightly, all of the text appears as does an
OK button.

This can be further demonstrated with this code

using System;
using System.Windows.Forms;
using System.ComponentModel;
using System.Drawing;

public class FirstForm : Form
{
  private Container components;
  private Label howdyLabel;

  public FirstForm()
  {
    InitialiseComponent();
  }

  private void InitialiseComponent()
  {
    components = new Container();
    howdyLabel = new Label();

    howdyLabel.Location = new Point(12, 116);
    howdyLabel.Text = &quot;Howdy, Partner!&quot;;
    howdyLabel.Size = new Size(267, 40);
    howdyLabel.AutoSize = true;
    howdyLabel.Font = new Font (&quot;Sans Serif&quot;, 26,
System.Drawing.FontStyle.Bold);
    howdyLabel.TabIndex = 0;
    howdyLabel.Anchor = AnchorStyles.None;
    howdyLabel.TextAlign = ContentAlignment.MiddleCenter;

    Text = &quot;First form&quot;;
    Controls.Add(howdyLabel);
  }

  public static void Main()
  {
    Application.Run(new FirstForm());
  }
}

In this case, only the word &quot;How&quot; is displayed (something has gone badly
wrong here). Interestingly, it appears at the bottom of the window. If
the window is expanded side ways, the text jumps to the middle (where it
should be).

Okay, I know it's too early to start filing these into bugzilla, but
it's worth mentioning now.

TTFN

Paul

P.S. Clicking on the close window icon does nothing, apps currently need
to be exited by terminating them in a task window. Annoying, but not a
problem ;-)
