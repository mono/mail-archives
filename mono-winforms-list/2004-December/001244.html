Hi,

I'm about to finish off a compiling mono from scratch on a virgin
machine and it has been suggested by a friend at the ACCU that I also
add in a FAQ for mono.

I can think of a couple of questions, but are there any questions that
seem to crop up time and again where a FAQ may be useful?

Feel free to email to me off-list (or even on list!).

Also, would there be any problems with me registering a domain called
using-mono.org.uk (or something similar) as my contribution to the
bigger picture? (I'm guessing that the suits at Novell may object, even
if Miguel et al is cool with it).=20

It would have lots of building instructions, some C# example and
platform specific material as well as current status of the project
overall. Bandwidth depending, a mirror of the svn may even be possible.
All in planning, just depends on if Novell say it's okay. I would want
their blessing before I do anything like that with the name.

TTFN

Paul
