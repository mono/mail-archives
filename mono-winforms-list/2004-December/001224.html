<PRE>&gt;<i>Ok, what component/control should I take then? Maybe DataGrid*Style
</I>&gt;<i>components, they don't seem hard to implement - and it will lead us to
</I>&gt;<i>implementing the DataGrid component.
</I>Since I am preparing to switch from SWF to MWF as default, I already have 
some of those files created. Also, they may not seem hard, but they are. 
They need to be done in conjunction with the DataGrid control, to ensure we 
don't end up with stubs or code that doesn't interoperate. The 
DataGrid*Style functions have painting functions, tie into the UI and 
probably need to be used in conjunction with the actual DataGrid control.

Ashwin Bharambe wanted to do both Color and Open/Save file, I don't think he 
can work on both simultaneously, and both take quite a bit of time, both are 
rather important, how about dividing those between the two of you?



Cheers,
