Hi Peter,

&gt;<i> Yeah, we are aware of those issues. We run into them every day yet it see=
</I>ms=20
&gt;<i> that there's always something more pressing to be worked on. I've had to=20
</I>&gt;<i> resize my test app's window for the last 4 weeks to make my edit control=20
</I>&gt;<i> show up, you'd think I'd have it fixed by now :-)=20
</I>
I can appreciate that - I've been in the same situation on a number of
applications I have worked on in the past; the problem is well known but
the fix can be problematic as it could well break a lot more than it
fixes!

&gt;<i> Often, though, I keep the=20
</I>&gt;<i> problem around until I have time to look into and fully understand what's=
</I>=20
&gt;<i> happening, to make sure the 'fix' isn't just a 'workaround' that's hiding=
</I>=20
&gt;<i> the real problem.
</I>
Definitely!

Whereabouts in the source are these problems? I'd like to get involved
rather than just sitting back and reporting bugs (which I'm happy to do,
but my fingers are getting itchy!)

TTFN

Paul
