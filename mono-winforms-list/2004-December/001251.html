Many thanks. I thought that WM_HELP event was already handled becouse we 
have the HelpRequest method in CommonDialog and that somebody forgot to 
set the EX_CONTEXTHELP window style in class Form.

I was using TortoiseSVN for creating the patch - obviously didn't check 
the patch before sending it. Never used it before for creating patches. 
Sorry.

This is what I wanted to ask about but I forgot (apparently) the 
operator precedance. Thanks again.
