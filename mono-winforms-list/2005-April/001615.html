<PRE>The first patch is valid. The second is not. The logic looks like it =
still needs fixed (when should needs_redraw be set to false), but my =
solution does not seem to be working...

Also, the setting of 'needs_redraw =3D false' (line 3181) should be =
moved outside of the if block. Notice that it can never actually get =
inside the if block, since that is the only place needs_redraw is set to =
false.

      I noticed that support for double buffering has been included in =
Control.cs. This is nice, except that I think the two calls to DrawImage =
(lines 3177 and 3195) should pass ClientRectangle as the second =
parameter, rather than ClipRectangle of the paint event args. According =
to MS documentation, and actual behavior,  &quot;The image represented by the =
image object is scaled to the dimensions of the rect rectangle.&quot;=20
      Thus with the code as is, the code as is draws the ImageBuffer to =
the ClipRectangle. When the clip rectangle is the entire control, this =
makes sense. However, when the clip rectangle is just part of the =
control (like when a partially obstructing window is removed) the whole =
control is drawn to the clip area. (I can send an image if anyone wants =
to see).=20

Thanks,
Jonathan
