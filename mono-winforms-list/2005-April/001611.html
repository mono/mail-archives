<PRE>Hello Jordi,
Thank you for your answer.
I logged the bug at bugzilla as you said, and  I understand that the problem 
was meanwhile fixed in SVT. Can you please explain me how to 
identify/download the corresponding Mono patch at 
<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-patches/,">http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-patches/,</A> and how to install it 
into my actual Mono release ? Do I have to first download/install all Mono 
patches released since the last 1.1.6 official version ? Are the patches 
always available for both Windows and Linux platforms ?
And I have some more questions regarding the handling of Mono mailing lists, 
as I am new with Mono mailing lists : if necessary to attach a file to a 
message, can I just attach it directly to the email I send to the mailing 
list ? And how can I disable the automatic receiving into my email mailbox 
of messages posted by other users, regarding other topics than those posted 
by me (I dont know where to find my user profile) ?
Thanks in advance.
Regards,
Diana
