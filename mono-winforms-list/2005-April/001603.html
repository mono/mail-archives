Hi Jon,

	These patches look good to me. Please feel free to commit. As for your
bug, could you put a bug report in bugzilla?

Also could you remember to send patches as a diff file in the future
though?

Thanks
Jackson

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [Mono-winforms-list] Splitter
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>        I use the splitter in the property grid control, and made a few
</I>&gt;<i> changes to it. Most importantly, instead of resizing the controls as the
</I>&gt;<i> splitter is dragged, I display a bar on top of the controls (how MS SWF
</I>&gt;<i> does it) indicating the position and only resize the controls when the
</I>&gt;<i> mouse button is released. It works well running against .Net, but it has
</I>&gt;<i> a few idiosyncrasies with Mono.
</I>&gt;<i>        
</I>&gt;<i> 1. In horizontal mode, the splitter works well except that the bar is
</I>&gt;<i> not drawing correctly (some sort of painting issue).
</I>&gt;<i> 2. In vertical mode, the splitter works fine moving to the right, but
</I>&gt;<i> not to the left (when docked to the left). This appears to be a
</I>&gt;<i> MouseMove event issue though. When moving to the left past the original
</I>&gt;<i> position of the splitter, the mouse event args start out good (they
</I>&gt;<i> become negative), but after moving slightly to the left of the
</I>&gt;<i> splitter's original position, the mouse event args values become large
</I>&gt;<i> (63546 or some number like that, perhaps some sort of signed/unsigned
</I>&gt;<i> issue?).
</I>&gt;<i> 3. There are some other smaller issues, but the control seems to behave
</I>&gt;<i> slightly better than before since it doesn't try to resize the controls
</I>&gt;<i> every time the mouse moves. (Drawing the bar indicating the position
</I>&gt;<i> took a while to figure out. On windows, MS probably gets the DC to the
</I>&gt;<i> desktop and draws on it. I know of no cross platform way to do that. I
</I>&gt;<i> tried handling the splitter's siblings paint event, and drawing the bar
</I>&gt;<i> on each control. That didn't work. Currently, I create a form with no
</I>&gt;<i> border and with a checkerboard pattern background. I move this with the
</I>&gt;<i> mouse moves)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's not perfect, but it helped me in my work on the propertygrid. Give
</I>&gt;<i> it a try and let me know if you want me to check in the changes, etc. 
</I>&gt;<i>
