<PRE>Hi!
&gt;<i> 1. This a violation of Microsoft intelectual property. This is just not
</I>&gt;<i> right and you will not help any open source project doing that.
</I>
Alright, the questions seems rather stupid to me now. I was under the
impression that the
.NET Framework was a free package as well...

&gt;<i> 2. If you are looking for PropertyGrid techniques, there are examples
</I>&gt;<i> out there with source code for .Net and Java. Looking at any CIL is just
</I>&gt;<i> not the way to go.
</I>
I cant agree with you there. I have found lots of articles about Designers,
TypeConverters, etc... but they all only cover a small spot and you find
yourself using code you dont understand in no time. But if you have a simple
question (for instance: how can the color in the PG be selected by such a
cool DropDown?) there is nothing like the real thing and a bit MSDN. You
just take one look and know that you should use the
IWindowsFormsEditorService - now where else can you learn about that?

Greetz,

Ben
