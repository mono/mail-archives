<PRE>Peter,

thanks again. However I still can't get it to work.

Again, I've un-installed wine and wine-devel. I've re-installed wine,
wine is in /usr/lib/wine. mono is in /usr/bin.

I do what you say

./configure --with-wine=/usr -prefix=/usr
make
make install

I see winform.exe.so in /usr/lib and again all the links seem to be correct.

However when i run the app I now get

Could not stat /nt (No such file or directory), ignoring drive E:
Could not stat /home/kevinj/.wine/${HOME} (No such file or directory), ignoring drive F:
Warning: could not find wine config [Drive x] entry for current working directory /home/kevinj/temp/winforms; starting in windows directory.
Warning: L&quot;/usr/lib/winelib.exe.so&quot; not accessible from a configured DOS drive
Warning: L&quot;/usr/lib/winelib.exe.so&quot; not accessible from a configured DOS drive
wine: cannot find '/usr/lib/winelib.exe.so'

Any thing else you can offer?

Thanks

Kevin Jones
