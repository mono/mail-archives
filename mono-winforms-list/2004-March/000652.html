<PRE>&gt;<i>a)  [Peter] Is the level of the SWF support in 0.31 a matter of things
</I>you
&gt;<i>have yet to do with the Winelib approach, or is it due to the particular
</I>&gt;<i>branch of the codebase that is being conveniently packaged and released
</I>in
&gt;<i>.rpm's?  That is, if I were to grab a snapshot, go through build, etc.,
</I>&gt;<i>would I gain all of the SWF functionality that is listed in the go-mono
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;Class Status&quot; for SWF?  (&quot;76%&quot;).
</I>The Class Status is automatically generated, based on [ToDo] tags and
other stuff. It does not indicate that 76% of SWF are properly working.


&gt;<i>b) Are there some tuning tips, setup steps I've missed, or just plain
</I>&gt;<i>wackiness at my end?  As I mentioned in an earlier post, so far I'm
</I>seeing a
&gt;<i>lot of &quot;debug&quot; output, very poor redraw, some rendering issues, and also
</I>&gt;<i>some font oddities (italics on buttons changing to normal at press) -- 
</I>these
&gt;<i>seem to be a degeneration from the 0.28 hack.
</I>The debug output is normal. We've changed a lot since 0.28, not only the
wine integration, but also System.Drawing and libgdiplus. It is alpha
code, alpha code will have debug statements. We have 'hacks' in the code
that have printfs associated to ensure they are not forgotten, there are
printfs to support developing a particular feature, etc. The more complete
libgdiplus, SD and SWF get, the fewer debug statements you will see.

Cheers,
 Peter
