<PRE>XraniX reported a few days ago a particular error; his installs were from
the CVS modules.

I installed mono 0.31 and performed a ./configure, make, make install on
winelib 0.1 sourcecode from the go-mono home.  I had/have the latest wine
installed, and I had mono 0.30.2.

I had also (the previous day) made several attempts to build mono
(fullbuild) from CVS.  I didn't succeed with these, reaching a point where
&quot;assembly mcs.exe could not be loaded&quot; ... this despite mcs being present.
I couldn't figure this out by the end of the day, so I hopped on the 0.31
package distribution this morning for salvation.

After the package installs I ran into various and sundry issues such as
mscorlib reported as out of synch (have 10 looking for 14), etc.  Somehow I
have more or less resolved these issues by a combination of deleting
directories, de-installing/reinstalling packages, and giving the env
variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH a value pointing to my mono libraries.

mono 0.31 is now faithfully presenting a simple, simple, simple SWF on my
SuSE/x86:  a Form containing a TextBox.

However, anything more complex -- a few Labels, TextBoxes, and a couple of
Buttons yields the following.  By the way, this same type of &quot;more complex&quot;
test case WAS rendering ok on RedHat using the mono-wine-0.28.
