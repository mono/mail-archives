<PRE>Folks,

I'm trying to get Mono to work with Wine, and I've asked some of this
over on the mono-user list so you may have seen this there.

I'm running on Fedora Core 1 and I've grabbed the latest Mono RPMs for
the distribution from the mono web site. I also have the latest Wine.
And I've grabbed the winelib bits from mono.

Following various emails from Peter Bartok, I removed mono and wine
(including the -devel bits), I also removed the *.dll.so libs from
/usr/lib.

I then install wine and wine-devel followed by all the RPMs from the
download (Cairo, GTK#, icu, pixman etc.). I then build and installed
winelib from the source on the mono web site. Winelib sets up the links
from /usr/lib to /usr/lib/wine.

winelib.exe.so is in /usr/local/lib
wine is in /usr/lib/wine

Wine works (I can run wine notepad).
Mono works (I can compile and run .Net code)

If I try and run a WinForms app (it's one of the samples off the Mono
Winforms page), I get the following:

Could not load winelib.exe.so
Unhandled Exception: System.TypeInitializationException: An exception
was thrown by the type initializer for System.Windows.Forms.Control ---&gt;
System.TypeInitializationException: An exception was thrown by the type
initializer for System.Windows.Forms.Win32 ---&gt;

in &lt;0x0004f&gt; (wrapper remoting-invoke-with-check)
MyFormProject.MainForm:.ctor ()
in &lt;0x0001b&gt; MyFormProject.MainForm:Main (string[])

I've tried copying winform.exe.so into /usr/lib but then I get an error
telling me that winform.exe.so from /usr/local/lib.

I don't have an LD_LIBRARY_PATH exported (should I?)

I'm now stuck. I've un-installed and re-installed several times with no
luck. Any help would be gratefully appreciated.

Thanks,

Kevin Jones
