<PRE>Currently, there's no difference in the level of 'completeness' of SWF
between 0.28 and 0.31. I am tasked to have SWF complete by the time Mono
1.2 is released. You don't need to build out of CVS to always have the
latest, you should be fine by using pulling a new daily (
<A HREF="http://go-mono.com/daily/">http://go-mono.com/daily/</A> )whenever you want to check progress.

In theory, things shouldn't get corrupted by a refresh, but the safe way,
if you always need a working mono version, build the latest with a
different, private &lt;prefix&gt; dir for testing. That keeps your RPM version
of mono untouched until you update to a newer RPM.

Cheers,
  Peter

&gt;<i>Miguel said 0.31 supports SWF in an &quot;alpha&quot; form.  Is &quot;alpha&quot; to the same
</I>&gt;<i>level as indicated by the SWF progress chart of a week ago, or is it to
</I>the
&gt;<i>same level as the 0.28 mono-wine solution provided?  I.e. to get the most
</I>&gt;<i>recent support (yes, yes, I KNOW it's preliminary ... I DON'T CARE ...
</I>I'm
&gt;<i>just trying to indicate NOW what Mono will be capable of doing in the
</I>next
&gt;<i>year or two)   ... anyway, to get the most recent SWF support do I need
</I>to
&gt;<i>download and build off of CVS?  However, if were to do that, is there any
</I>&gt;<i>way that I can prevent a corruption of my presently working 0.31 install?
