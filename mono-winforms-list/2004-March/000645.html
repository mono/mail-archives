<PRE>As I've worked through various configurations and previous installs, I, too, have seen the same messages that Kevin is seeing.

Kevin, by any chance did you have a previous install of the mono-wine 0.28 solution?

That solution places a hidden .wine directory in one's home.  Peter, does that need to be blown away before a Wine, Mono 0.31 install?  Could its presence confuse the installs?

My task today is to try to deconvolute the problems I've caused on a Red Hat system when I went through the 0.31 install procedure without first having yanked out the 0.28 mono-wine.  [I've seen Peter's posts on the matter and will attempt to apply].  Further, I probably have the February 2004 Wine installed ... I'm suspicious that this may not be consistent with Mono-0.31 (just a hypothesis) as the Red-Carpet channel gives me the August 2003 version.

By the way, one thing with Red-Carpet and having mixed 0.28 and 0.31 ... Red-Carpet seems to get into a circular dependency and I'm not certain how to correct (other than try using rpm and some of the &quot;force&quot; flags); i.e. if I try to remove 0.28, RC says that it is going to remove 0.31 as it is dependent.  Then if I re-install 0.31, RC says it is going to install 0.28 because it is needed by 0.31.
