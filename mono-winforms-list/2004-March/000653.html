<PRE>&gt;<i>In a couple of posts I speculated Wine version might be a factor, and I
</I>kept citing an &quot;August 2003&quot; version as that which the Red-Hat mono
channel provided.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>My eyes may have been crossed ... I just used Red Hat to install Wine Feb
</I>2004.  This isn't the latest (there is a March release on wine-hq), but it
is working!

There is a difference between wine versions. There are references to two
internal wine structures in libgdiplus. In the latest wine version, one of
those structures was changed. If you were to try and run System.Drawing
(libgdiplus) with the latest version of Wine, you would get a Bad Drawable
X error. I'm working on a solution. If you were to use an older version of
wine (e.g. March of last year), you'd get the same error, because of
another structure in Wine having been changed.

Peter
