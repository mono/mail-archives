Hi Stefano,
 
In Windows, Maximized is not the same as full screen. However, it can 
sometimes appear the
same, if you have set the task bar to disappear when a form is maximized.
 
In other words, I think you are seeing differences in both platform and user 
setup.
 
Charlie

Hi,i'm trying to create a Kiosk application, but when i try to set a winform 
in this way
 
            this.FormBorderStyle = FormBorderStyle.None;
            this.WindowState = FormWindowState.Maximized;
            this.TopMost = true;

It doesn't fit all screen.
Infact the task bar and application bar at the top and bottom of the desktop 
are still showed.
In windows all works fine.
Could you help me ??
Thanks in advance
Stefano
