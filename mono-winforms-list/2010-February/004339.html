Hi,

Two questions which my frazzled brain isn't coping with...

I have a pile of resources for a project which the resource manager handles
quite nicely. I have an XML file which contains the name of the resource,
but stored as a string rather than as an Image (it's the name of the
resource).

Is there a way that I can have

pictureBox1.Image = foo.Properties.Resources.filename where filename is the
string that contains the filename? I've tried casting the string, but
nothing.

foo.Properties.Resources is showing all of the resources available and the
files are there.

Second...

I have an rtf text box and I have two rtf files held in the resources. I
created the rtf files in OpenOffice and can load them back in and the
formatting is there.

I try to load them into a form using

helptext.LoadFile(global::molarity.Properties.Resources.molarmass,
RichTextBoxStreamType.RichText);

and it comes out in plain text. No formatting or anything like that.

Am I missing something here?

TTFN

Paul
