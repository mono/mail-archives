Hi,

I'm the designer of a free software for a miniature strategy game (AT-43)
army buider. As I've designed this software with the tools I know well, I
chose VB.Net to deal with it.

Some screenshots
<A HREF="http://rcommunity.nazgulworld.com/index.php?page=screen">http://rcommunity.nazgulworld.com/index.php?page=screen</A>

This software is worth
- 6060 lines in business objects
- 5160 lines in interface objects
- 6050 lines codes generated by IDE
- 1000 lines in external library 


Some of the community member asked for a OSX and Linux version of my
software. As I've absolutely no knowledge, I decided to pass on that matter.
But I've noticed Mono for a while, I think that could be the way to make a
portable software for those OS.


I've tried to run my software (compiled with VB.Net) with Mono. It loads not
too bad but freeze and quit without any error message. The MoMA tool gave no
issue. Further more, many strings aren't correct.


I don't want to change my IDE (VB Express is nice and easy), neither asking
Windows users to install Mono. But I'm ready to track each line code that
would crash the software under each environement.


How should I proceed from here ?

Thx for your help
