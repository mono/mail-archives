Hi,

I've been asked to try and get a .NET 1.1 application working under Mono. 
It makes quite a few Windows API calls, but also calls several other DLLs
using PInvoke.  Most of these DLLs can probably be recompiled under Linux,
but probably not all.

&gt;<i>From looking around, it seems that it's not possible to call Windows DLLs
</I>via PInvoke using Mono, but I wanted to make sure this is the case.  Someone
mentioned something called &quot;ctypes&quot; as a way of doing this, but this seems
to be a Python thing.

I'd appreciate input on what my options might be available here, and whether
it's worth trying to go further.  A few other specific questions - answers
or URLs appreciated:

- Is there any way at all to get the equivalent of calls into User32.dll?  
Most of these are in User32.dll.  The application is very GUI-intensive.

- Is it possible to use Wine to run the DLLs?  I've seen references to this
idea, but I don't think I've found anything concrete.

- If the other DLLs could be recompiled into .so files under Linux, can I
use PInvoke without changing anything except &quot;.dll&quot; into &quot;.so&quot;, or do
parameter names and types need to be changed too?  (i.e. would this possibly
be a significant porting effort in its own right?)
