There's nothing wrong with the WinForms installation, the problem is
elsewhere and may not cause you any other problems. :-)

The -pkg option adds references to sets of pre-defined set of assemblies. 
On your box, some of the libraries from the 'dotnet' set are not installed. 
As they are quite exotic it's probably not an issue for you (well maybe
'oracle' is not so exotic).

So, is it a general fault in ubuntu's installer to use the default dotnet.pc
file, but not install all the assemblies that it references? [1]  As a
workaround I'd just edit the dotnet.pc to remove the missing assemblies. 
(Or create a dotnetGood.pc copy with the edits and reference it).

Andy


[1] To someone more experienced about the compiler: since the assembly
references in the .pc file are implicit (not specified by the user) should
the compiler just not produce an error report when any is missing but only
report a warning?  Or maybe the user would ignore the warnings thus and
swear at the compiler when the fault was with the installation...
