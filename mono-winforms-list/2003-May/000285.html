<PRE>Hello,

    I would like to hear from Alexandre and Aleksey about whether they
can get their existing Windows.Forms test applications running with the
new Wine setup.  To do this, you need:

	* Wine version as specified in the OpenLink download page.

	* Wine patches applied to Wine.

	* Install as documented in the readme.

    Now, the OpenLink code currently requires a modified Mono engine, I
think these can be avoided, but I need people to tell me whether this
works or not.  I have been unable to run applications with the new SWF.

    To do this, compile the latest System.Windows.Forms, and do:

	export SWF=1
	mono YourApp.exe

    The &quot;export SWF=1&quot; is the trick.  This tells the runtime library to
initialize the Wine library from managed code, without requiring
patches to the Mono runtime.

Miguel.
