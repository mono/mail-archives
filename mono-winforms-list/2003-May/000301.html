We're prepared to maintain the patches to keep up with Wine whenever
there is good reason for it (such as one of those you mentioned) at
least for now. Have you found or do you think there are any current
issues that would prompt migration?

The snapshot release current version is based on is already quite old so
I suppose we'd start migrating to a newer snapshot pretty soon if I
manage to do without Vlad in our Virtuoso-related developments. So far
I've been able to allocate almost 100% of his time for this.

All suggestions for next target snapshot are welcome. We need to choose
one that seems to be relatively stable. Watch this space for updates :)

Thanks,

Yrjänä
