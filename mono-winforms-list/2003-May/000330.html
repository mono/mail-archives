<PRE>Hello Mario,

Now I understand the situation better.
Sorry for providing useless advice in previous email.

&gt;<i>&quot;But then make sure that you distclean/clean the patched wine 
</I>&gt;<i>source before recompiling using &quot;make wine-shared&quot;.&quot;
</I>
&quot;distclean&quot; is a target in Wine's Makefile
# distclean:       also remove all files created by configure

IMO, Window is not visible and cannot be created due to 
some problems with win32server :

May be you can try to follow Aleksey's recommendation, but
I hope that Vlad will provide a new version of WineLib 
which will resolve the problems.

On Red Hat, I can run some applications using only WineLib build 
(make wine-shared &amp;&amp; make wine-shared-install) and without starting
win32server first. If you use Red Hat, I hope that I can help to
get test app running.
