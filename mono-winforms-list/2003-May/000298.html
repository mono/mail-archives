<PRE>Hi,

Yesterdays meeting was a sort of experiment. The meeting was good. I'm sure
more will follow in the near future but not sure when.

There was a little agenda (<A HREF="http://theoretic.com/mike/wine-notes">http://theoretic.com/mike/wine-notes</A>) we followed
but more things were discussed. Near the end of the discussion was a
part about Mono and Wine. It mainly was about using Wine as shared objects. 
Lots of solutions were proposed but about all were very hard to implement. 

In the end it was more decided that we should look at it again in the future
when Wine is more stable and Mono's SWF is more useable.
