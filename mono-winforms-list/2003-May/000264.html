<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> I'm really keen to see results of my work running on 
</I>&gt;<i> Linux, but it seems that my level of expertise in
</I>&gt;<i> Linux is not enough to set up all this required stuff
</I>&gt;<i> manually. So I'm wondering, are you going to produce
</I>&gt;<i> required binaries (monogui etc.) in the form of
</I>&gt;<i> packages just like it's done now for mono runtime and
</I>&gt;<i> mcs in the future releases ? 
</I>
I wanted to do this for this release, but I ran out of time.

Also, we had a deadlock:

	* I wanted to get approval to commit the init code
	  to Application.cs, but that would make the code
	  only with Winforms.

	  We need a better way of initializing the Wine
	  currently, but am not sure how.

	* Since the code was not on CVS, I could not build
	  wine packages.

I have also a few questions:  Maybe we should install the wine runtime
under a separate directory, say $prefix/mono-wine, to avoid conflicting
with an existing Wine installation (am not sure whether this is
required or not).

Miguel
