<PRE>Hello,

   This is a list of the error messages I get while trying to run a
sample Windows forms application.  The program corrupts the memory after
this point and Mono sits on a tight loop handling SIGSEGV.

It might be worth discussing these:

	 WARNING **: Failed to load library libuxtheme.dll.so (uxtheme.dll): libuxtheme.dll.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
	 WARNING **: Failed to load library libuxtheme.dll.so (uxtheme.dll): libuxtheme.dll.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

We should probably #ifdef the references to libuxtheme.dll in win32functions.cs

	WARNING **: Failed to load function UpdateLayeredWindow from user32.dll
	WARNING **: Failed to load function GetScrollBarInfo from user32.dll

I dont think we are using these, we should probably ifdef-them out
until we figure out why they are missing from Wine

SEARCH DefMDIChildProcAW
SEARCH DefFrameProcAW

	WARNING **: Failed to load function DllGetVersion from comctl32.dll

These are not currently used (only used to test if we are a given
version), it would be ideal if we could implement these. 

	WARNING **: Failed to load function IsDialogMessage from user32.dll

Missing from WineLib?

	WARNING **: Failed to load library libcomdlg32.dll.so (comdlg32.dll): libcomdlg32.dll.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

This is not currently built by the WineLib code, not sure how to fix this.

        Adding Control
        
This is where the code gets a segfault, I believe this is
CreateWindowEx, but I can no longer get a stack trace with the
failure.  The code just loops there now.
