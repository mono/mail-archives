<PRE>&gt;<i> Is there no chance that the Wine project would accept these patches

</I>
Currently no, the patches are not suitable for merging. Parts of them
may be able to be merged, somebody needs to look at it .... especially
the DllMain renames.

&gt;<i> Seems like being able to use Winelib in a 'pure library' mode is

</I>
This has been discussed many times, you are right that it would be
useful, however the technical challenges are great. In order to
accurately emulate Win32 at a binary level Wine has to carefully control
the runtime environment, this involves things like threads being Wine
aware. Basically being able to dynamically load Wine is something of a
holy grail, but at the moment nobody is seriously working on it.

thanks -mike
