only got to know about this meeting today. 

I'm reading the logfile now. Thanks for the link :)

&gt;<i> Hi,

</I>&gt;<i> Yesterdays meeting was a sort of experiment. The meeting was good. I'm sure

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There was a little agenda (<A HREF="http://theoretic.com/mike/wine-notes">http://theoretic.com/mike/wine-notes</A>) we followed
</I>&gt;<i> but more things were discussed. Near the end of the discussion was a
</I>&gt;<i> part about Mono and Wine. It mainly was about using Wine as shared objects. 
</I>&gt;<i> Lots of solutions were proposed but about all were very hard to implement. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the end it was more decided that we should look at it again in the future
</I>&gt;<i> when Wine is more stable and Mono's SWF is more useable.
