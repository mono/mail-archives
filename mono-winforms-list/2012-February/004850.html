<PRE>Hi all!

I'm almost finished with an application of mine that I developed with M
Visual Studio 2010 using c#.

The software uses a lot of SQLite transactions, all of which work perfect
compiled and run under Windows.
Now I try to make my app multiplatform, using Mono (for the first time). And
I can't seem to get Mono work with SQLite properly.

Run w Mono basically the first of almost any type of SQLite transaction
makes the app instacrashquit.:(

I have a reference for
using System.Data.SQLite;

as a starting point.

Mono adapter tool MoMa throws 100 errors about this current .dll

I downloaded a dll called 
Mono.Data.Sqlite;
but as funny as it seems, MoMa throws around 100 other problems about this
.dll too!

I'm sure I'm missing something as I'm pretty inexperienced yet especially w
Mono, porting and other systems than Win.

Please help me what to do next!

Thx!

Best Regards

ZAX
