<PRE>Hi all,

Just wanted to give you quick a heads up:  Hisham Mardam Bey has updated our 
libgdiplus library to work with the new Cairo 1.0 APIs over the last month 
or so. We've now reached the point where it is running without errors and 
since Cairo released yesterday, we are planing on switching over to the new 
Cairo 1.0 based libgdiplus tomorrow.

Some quick and dirty benchmarks have shown that operations with the new 
Cairo library are between 30% and 60% faster than before. This is great 
news, especially for MWF, application performance 'feels' much better now.

While we have tested the new lib quite thoroughly, however, it is always 
possible that we missed something and that you may run into a problem that 
didn't exist with the previous library. If you do, please let us know on the 
list or file a bug report so we can get it squared away. Your patience is 
appreciated during the switch-over.

Cheers,
  Peter, on behalf of the whole Novell Managed Windows.Forms team (Jackson, 
Jordi and Hisham) 

</PRE>
