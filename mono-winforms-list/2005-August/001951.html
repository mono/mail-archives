<PRE>Hi Jordi,

&gt;<i> A change in Graphics.cs done a few days bug exposed a bug that we had in
</I>&gt;<i> libgdiplus. I fix that bug in SVN revision 48839 for the new libgdiplus
</I>&gt;<i> library but not for the current libgdiplus since it going to be gone in
</I>&gt;<i> a few hours. 
</I>
Thanks. 

&gt;<i> You can get the new libgdiplus from the SVN libgdiplus-cairo-upgrade
</I>&gt;<i> branch or wait until late today or tomorrow when we will merge the
</I>&gt;<i> libgdiplus-cairo-upgrade into the current one.
</I>
Am I better off deleting the current libgdiplus I have and doing an SVN
checkout for the new libgdiplus and then when the new libgdi is
officially released, reverting to checking out libgdiplus as normal as
the libgdiplus-cairo-upgrade will be effectively finished with (as far
as users go)?

TTFN

Paul
