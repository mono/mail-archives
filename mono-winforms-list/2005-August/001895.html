<PRE>Hi!

I'm a student in University Of Kuopio in Finland. I'm about to do master's 
thesis concerning Mono and Windows.Forms. My plan was to make a simple game 
and compare performance of .NET and Mono with it. To achieve this goal I have 
to make a game loop that runs on maximum speed and then count the frames per 
second.

This is easy to do with .NET by overriding main forms &quot;OnPaint&quot;-method and 
calling &quot;this.Invalidate()&quot; at the end of it. This is very simple and 
effective but only seems to work with .NET. Mono doesn't start looping this 
way. It seems that Mono always needs somekind of event (from Timer for 
example) to call &quot;OnPaint&quot;-method.

I know this is not the only way to make it work, but I have tried many other 
ways too without results. I can make the loop work with Timer but its maximum 
frequency is too small for performance comparisons. So I need your help to 
make a game loop that runs as fast as it can on Mono!

I hope that someone understood what I'm trying to say here and propably could 
give me some hints.
