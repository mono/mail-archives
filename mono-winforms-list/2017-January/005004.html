<PRE>Hi, Sachsa,

i'm starting to learn C# on Linux. So i can't use Visual Studio.
&gt;<i> Actually i'm using Rider, but it haven't a visual editor for winforms.
</I>&gt;<i> Now i found <A HREF="https://github.com/mono/mwf-designer">https://github.com/mono/mwf-designer</A> . Is that the prefered
</I>&gt;<i> way to create winforms on Linux? The last commit there is 6 years ago.
</I>

Windows Forms is there in any mono installation, without the need to
install anything else, so I understand it is tempting. Unfortunately,
Winforms is currently considered obsolete, both by Microsoft (which has
offered wpf since long time ago), and Xamarin (which never completed Mono's
Winforms support at 100%). That said, you can use Winforms in Linux if the
available support meets your needs.

The best GUI to use now is probably Gtk#, which works in Windows, Linux and
Mac.The only woe here is that it is based in Gtk+ 2, while nowadays Gtk +3
is currently the thing to target. It still works for now, hope it also
works in the future.
