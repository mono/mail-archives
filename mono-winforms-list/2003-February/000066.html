<PRE>I have been looking into this problem as well but I have not made much
progress. It seems as though the existing implementation of threads in
Wine has some issues with the latest glibc. There is some new
information on the WineHQ site at <A HREF="http://www.winehq.com/news/?view=155.">http://www.winehq.com/news/?view=155.</A>
They even mention us :).

I have been trying to get the garbage collector to work under WineLib
first (before worrying about the Mono runtime) using this code:

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;gc/gc.h&gt;
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;

int PASCAL WinMain (HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, LPSTR
lpszCmdLine, int nCmdShow)
{
	GC_malloc (1);
	return 0;
}

I have tried recompiling the garbage collection library under WineLib
and linking with this instead of the pthread version. When compiled this
way it uses Win32 (Wine) threads instead of pthreads but it did not seem
to get much further than the pthread version.

I also tried using the Win32 implementation of pthreads at
<A HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/pthreads-win32/.">http://sources.redhat.com/pthreads-win32/.</A> It doesn't look like this is
compatible with the Wine source but it may be a starting point for
implementing the missing pthread functions in Wine.

Initially I was hoping we could add some code to monostub but I believe
a patch to the Wine source may be the best way to fix this problem.

I have started looking into getting WINE/WINELIB compatible with
pthreads and mono. If nothing else, I will document a better starting
point for those who follow. Wish me luck! Dennis
