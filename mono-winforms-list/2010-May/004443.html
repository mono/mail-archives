<PRE>If you want to custom paint the ComboBox chrome (not the item it shows), 
this is the way to go.

If you want to custom paint the ComboBox items (including the one 
currently shown in a closed ComboBox), Robert's example using OwnerDraw 
is the way to go.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Back when I was a lad and used the ol' 8 bit systems, I could create a

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> however, I can't see anything that says I can put a graphic in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> drop-down.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can it be done?
