<PRE>Hi,

I'm not sure if this a bug in mono, something not implemented or just
code provided by MS which is just wrong, but something is amiss here.

The code I've uploaded to
<A HREF="http://www.all-the-johnsons.co.uk/testing/designer.tar.bz2">http://www.all-the-johnsons.co.uk/testing/designer.tar.bz2</A> is available
from the MSDN website (can't recall the exact location). Works without a
hitch under VS 2005 (I have it running under VirtualBox here) and will
fire up under mono-2.6.4

Only problem is that it won't load the simpledesigner.xml file (it dies)
nor will it allow creation of a design (it comes up with an error that
something is not an instance which is annoying as I can't see anything
that would cause this problem).

Under mono, can anyone get this to run or is it a bug in mono (which I
can plop into BZ) or just something not yet available.

Warning : if you are trying to implement a winform designer, please do
NOT look at this code else thy shalt become tainted and your soul be
forever part of the MS collective...

TTFN

Paul
