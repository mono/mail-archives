Hi,

I'm trying to put together a small organic chemistry application which will
allow my students to create molecules which it will then name (or that the
program generates for the student to name). What I'm trying to do is this

Type in the name of the atom (say C). To either side, above and below a
combo appears which has in it a single (-), double (=) or triple bond (there
is a character for that - according to OOo, its U+2261). While this is okay,
if I want to do the same for the above and below, this will be hard as there
is not an equals sign twisted to 90 degrees or U+2261 turned through 90
degrees.

Back when I was a lad and used the ol' 8 bit systems, I could create a user
defined graphic which would show the || and ||| as a single character.
Today, I'm guessing a png or bmp file would do the same, however, I can't
see anything that says I can put a graphic in a drop-down. 

Can it be done?

TTFN

Paul
