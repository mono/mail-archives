Hi Jonathan, 

	Thank you!  Adding Mono.Posix to the References fixed things for my
Mac.  Now I must find out why it's still looking for
System.Windows.Forms on my XP machine. 

	Cheers!
 Dean

[1] it says: 
 &gt; 
 &gt; When debugging Winforms applications for Mono, many times it is
easier 
 &gt; if you can debug with Managed.Windows.Forms (MWF - Mono's version
of 
 &gt; System.Windows.Forms), instead of Microsoft's System.Windows.Forms.
To 
 &gt; accomplish this, you can load the MWF project file into your
solution, 
 &gt; which will allow you to debug into Mono's MWF code. 
 &gt; 
 &gt; This is what I am attempting to do but with little success. 
 The project files are likely out of date, so you may have to fix them

 first, like adding a reference to Mono.Posix. 
 You'll also have to do update the reference to MWF for any assembly
that 
 references System.Windows.Forms. If you are using 3rd party
assemblies 
 or assemblies you do not have the source for and make them all point
to 
 MWF, you will end up with errors like you saw that it cannot cast 
 between Control and Control, as one is the SWF Control, and the other
is 
 the MWF Control.
