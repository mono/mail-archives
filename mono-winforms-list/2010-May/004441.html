</I>&gt;<i> I'm trying to put together a small organic chemistry application which will

</I>&gt;<i> Type in the name of the atom (say C). To either side, above and below a
</I>&gt;<i> combo appears which has in it a single (-), double (=) or triple bond (there
</I>&gt;<i> is a character for that - according to OOo, its U+2261). While this is okay,
</I>&gt;<i> if I want to do the same for the above and below, this will be hard as there
</I>&gt;<i> is not an equals sign twisted to 90 degrees or U+2261 turned through 90
</I>&gt;<i> degrees.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Back when I was a lad and used the ol' 8 bit systems, I could create a user
</I>&gt;<i> defined graphic which would show the || and ||| as a single character.
</I>&gt;<i> Today, I'm guessing a png or bmp file would do the same, however, I can't
</I>&gt;<i> see anything that says I can put a graphic in a drop-down.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can it be done?

Set DrawMode of the combobox to DrawMode.OwnerDrawFixed (or *Variable,
depending on your needs) and handle combobox' DrawItem and MeasureItem
events.
