Hi,

What I think I would do is create my own CustomComboBox that inherits from
ComboBox, and override the OnPaint method to use the Graphics DrawString and
Transform methods (to add and rotate a bit of text). This should let you do
what you want in a flexible way. Images could also be added this way, if you
prefer.

PS: note there are a couple of known Unicode bugs in Mono WinForms, so you
might want to double check that this U+2261 character displays properly in a
ComboBox. If needed, the Graphics DrawLine method could be used as a
workaround.

</I>&gt;<i> however, I can't see anything that says I can put a graphic in a
