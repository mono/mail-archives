The 3rd solution could be to try the work-in-progress WinForms designer (as
explained on the link I gave), but I don't know how usable or mature it is.
I'll wait for it to be included in a stable release myself.
Personally, I develop my app on Windows with SharpDevelop, then try the exe
on Linux. Mono for Windows is helpful for debugging purposes too, as some
Mono bugs are there on all platforms.
