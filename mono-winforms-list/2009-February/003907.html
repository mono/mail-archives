<PRE>
First, I would like to thank all those who have put a tremendous amount of
effort into getting mono running on other platforms.  I have been aware of
the mono project for years, but have never had a need for it until now.

I am trying to run some basic WinForms applications using mono on Fedora 10. 
Thus, I installed mono 1.9.1.  Everywhere there is text on the applications,
whether the menu, buttons, checkbox controls, or anything else, my text has
been redacted.   In other words, there is no text there, just a black hole.

Now, I have been out of the Unix / Linux loop for years now, and have not
been very familiar with the current state of affairs.  I am sure this
problem I am having is a simple configuration issue, and I have tried
looking about, but have not been able to find an answer.

Anyone who can help me with this, I would greatly appreciate it.
