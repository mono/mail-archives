I found out just last week about the &quot;secret&quot; to properly size controls.
Some specific sizing problems can be Mono bugs, though, but I guess what you
need is:
<A HREF="http://mono-project.com/FAQ:_Winforms">http://mono-project.com/FAQ:_Winforms</A>
Top thing on that page. It's a font-related issue, and doesn't just affect
Mono or Linux, but any configuration that doesn't have the expected font. As
for me, it wasn't &quot;AutoScaleBaseSize&quot; (unlike what's said on the page) but:

this.AutoScaleDimensions = new System.Drawing.SizeF(6F, 13F);
this.AutoScaleMode = System.Windows.Forms.AutoScaleMode.Font;

I removed those lines, and the problem was gone. Basically, just look for
&quot;AutoScale&quot; in your Form file(s).

Redraw problems are most likely Mono bugs, which should be reported. That
said, if you have the Mono version shipped by default with Ubuntu, ie:
1.9.1, you're bound to encounter bugs that have already been fixed. Being
not particularly attached to Ubuntu myself, I actually moved from Ubuntu to
openSUSE 2 days ago, and am happy I made that move. Installing Mono 2.2 was
easy, and I have up-to-date software by default (such as OpenOffice 3.0
rather than 2.4, and so on). That said, if you're not as lazy as me, you can
also install/compile the latest Mono on Ubuntu yourself.
