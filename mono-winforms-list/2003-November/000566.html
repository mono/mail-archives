<PRE>Hi,

The MainMenu control seems to be working with the current cvs (but as
you can see from the screenshots it's a long way from finished or
correctly implemented.

When you say win2k are you talking about the mono or the .NET runtime ?
And can you give the exact exception it throws on your system.

As for a good IDE for C# under linux, there isn't a very good one,
&quot;yet&quot;.

I was hoping they would port #Develop to SWT# or GTK# but there seems to
be no activity on that front. Anjuta (www.anjuta.org) has some basic
syntax support for C# and is able to compile cs files, but doesn't offer
support for C# projects. 

I'm currenlty using Visual Studio .NET and SharpDevelop under windows
to design SWF applications. I use GLADE and Anjuta to design GTK#
applications under linux. 

There is a thread on the got-mono website on the subject:
<A HREF="http://www.gotmono.com/cgi-bin/yabb/YaBB.pl?board=PROJECT;action=display;num=1059764948">http://www.gotmono.com/cgi-bin/yabb/YaBB.pl?board=PROJECT;action=display;num=1059764948</A>

There is a lot of documentation on the mono homepage,
Also check this page: <A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com:8080/">http://www.go-mono.com:8080/</A>

It contains a complete handbook and an API reference aswell as a C#
language reference.

And of course there's the IRC channel (irc.gnome.org/#mono ; really nice
people there :p ) and the mailinglists if you need help or information.


I hope this helps you out.

</I>&gt;<i> 2) Where can i find IDE for C# under Linux ? It's rather bothering to

</I>&gt;<i> P.S.S. I woud like to say special thanx to people who developing Mono,
