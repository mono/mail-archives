<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> I already asked about this issue on IRC but I was wondering if it would
</I>&gt;<i> be possible to make mono (or the System.Windows.Forms-assemblies loader
</I>&gt;<i> -I have not checked how it actually works-) look for an environment
</I>&gt;<i> variable or an option. This would make it possible for the user to
</I>&gt;<i> choose which implementation he or she wants to use.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For example
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> export MONO_SWF_LIB=&quot;WineLib&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> mono Form1.exe
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> export MONO_SWF_LIB=&quot;Gtk&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> mono Form1.exe
</I>
I was thinking about this: maybe the runtime should have a mechanism
for picking up assemblies based on this.  This is a discussion that we
should address in more detail on mono-devel and plan.

In the meantime, I think that you could use MONO_PATH creatively and
some aliases, for example:

	mkdir /winforms/wine
	mv /usr/local/lib/System.Windows.Forms.dll /winforms/wine

	mkdir /winforms/gtk
	cp mcs/class/System.Windows.Forms/Gtk/*dll /winforms/gtk

And then use:

	alias wmono='MONO_PATH=/winforms/wine mono'
	alias gmono='MONO_PATH=/winforms/gtk mono'

Then you can switch between those two like this:

	wmono test.exe
	gmono test.exe

Miguel
