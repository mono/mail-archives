Hi,

As you can see from Alexandre Pigolkine's screenshots the implementation
of SWF for Mono on Windows also has rendering problems.

But one thing to keep in mind when comparing the .NET screenshots with
the Mono screenshots is
that I don't have the Windows XP styling engine enabled on my system.
This may cause minor
color differences. So if a color is more dark or bright then the other
control it may (but not for sure) be
due to the styling engine, if however you see a control which says
ForeColor=Red and the text is black,
trust me that's not the styling engine :p

Alexandre, would it be possible for you to disable the styling engine in
your XP ?
(Trough the menu you get when you right-click the desktop and select
properties from that contextmenu)
It would give us an even better view of the differences between the .NET
SWF and Mono SWF implemenation
on Windows.

Note: It seems the height property of the listbox control is ignored
when a horizontal scrollbar is to be viewed.

Timothy.
