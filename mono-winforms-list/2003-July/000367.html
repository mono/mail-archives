<PRE>This list isn't really the right one to ask such questions, it deals
mostly with implementing the System.Windows.Forms namespace, which is UI
related.

You'd be better off asking on mono-list.

As to your question, there are plenty of cases where Mono has been used,
but I have no idea about uptimes. Most of the work seems related to
functionality at the moment, rather than stability fixes, so I'd guess
there aren't too many problems.

Mono is still pretty new though. Your best bet is simply to try it.
