<PRE>Having seen the patched wine libs were now on the mono download page I wanted 
to finally try the System.Windows.Forms assembly, but I can't get it to run.  
Any help appreciated:

Here's what I've done:
1. Downloaded wine-20030318.tar.gz and patches from the wine patch site 
(ibiblio) and built and installed according to instructions there.

(NB There is a source code error after patching in line 695 where a variable 
HMODULE module is declared after other statements which is not allowed in C.  
I swapped lines 694 and 695 to cure.)

2. Rebuilt mono-0.25 from sources (using my currently installed version from 
an RPM caused mono errors finding the various wine .dll.so files)

3.  Built simple SWT example using mcs.

4.  Run using mono - reports the following and then EXITS leaving three 
threads running and no window appears:
  MonoWin32: Initializing WineLib

I tried setting env var 'SWT=1' as suggested in some places but this made no 
difference.

I notice the wine-patch archive includes patches to mono to build a monogui 
stub - is this still required?  (I couldn't get it to build; automake 
reported errors following instructions to patch mono)

My system is a SuSE 8.0 Linux with SMP kernel.
