<PRE>I posted this and Miguel answered previously with a workaround (I don't
know about a fix). I put Miguel's answer below.

Hello,

&gt;<i>      Sorry all, this is probably easy but I can't figure it out. I was
</I>
&gt;<i> running fine until I just updated from SVN (my source was maybe a week
</I>
&gt;<i> old). Now I get the following when I run a test app; obviously it  
</I>&gt;<i> can't find the X11 lib. SWF apps were working prior to my updating  
</I>&gt;<i> from SVN; did something change? I have libX11.so.6.2 in my  
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/X11R6/lib/ directory, and that path is in my /etc/ld.so.conf file
</I>
&gt;<i> (if that provides any info).
</I>
I had the exact same issue, I had to edit my LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to
/usr/X11R6/lib to make it work.

Am not sure why this is happening, I think the intention was to not
depend on the &quot;-devel&quot; packages which are the ones that ship the
version-less .so

In this process, someone forgot to test the code.

Subject: [Mono-winforms-list] An annoying problem

Hi,

Whenever I try to run a program compiled against MWF, I keep getting the
same error

Unhandled Exception: System.TypeInitializationException: An exception
was thrown by the initializer for System.Windows.Forms.XplatUI ---&gt;
System.DllNotFoundException: libX11.so.6.2

I know this has come up before and from what I remember when Miguel
flagged it up was that there was a problem within XplatUI.

Is there a work around or will XplatUI be getting fixed sometime in the
not too distant future?

TTFN

Paul
