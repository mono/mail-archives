<PRE>On 2005-06-08, Korn&#233;l P&#225;l scribbled these
curious markings:
&gt;<i> I have tried the code you sent on Windows using .NET Framework and Mono as
</I>&gt;<i> well. It worked but creating a window without a message queue will lead to
</I>&gt;<i> an unresponsive window.
</I>
As a matter of fact, that's precisely the point of that example. There's
several examples following it which fix the problem (though I have
problems with those, too). I would imagine that it's a problem with my
setup if it's not failing in the proper way, yes? I'm trying to learn
WinForms with Mono, and it's difficult if I don't see the same thing the
author describes.

&gt;<i> You should use only the following line in Main:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Application.Run(new Form());
</I>
Yep, that's mentioned as well.

Best Regards,
Christopher Nehren
