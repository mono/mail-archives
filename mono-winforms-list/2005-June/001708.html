<PRE>I'm guessing you're running this with Mono on X11, not on Win32. The fact 
that you're getting a Window at all is a particular Windows 'feature'. X11 
will not create a window until the message pump is running.

If you ran the same sample on Win32, with Mono and our MWF, you would see 
exact same results as with Microsoft's implementation (and as described in 
the book).
While it is thinkable to work around that somehow, by firing the message 
pump until the window shows up, I think that would cause more severe 
incompatibilities since some messages already have been processed.

Look at it this way: Mono's way of showing you on X11 how important a 
running message pump can be is way more impressive than on Windows :-) It 
really emphasizes the point by not even showing you a window, instead of 
showing a frozen window. Yes. I'm half kidding :-)

Cheers,
  Peter

</I>&gt;<i>As a matter of fact, that's precisely the point of that example. There's

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You should use only the following line in Main:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Application.Run(new Form());

</I>&gt;<i>Yep, that's mentioned as well.
