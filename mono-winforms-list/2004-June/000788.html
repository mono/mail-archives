Hi,

Other than for MessageBox, winforms in RC1 seems just about dead. I'm
trying to compile the very simple code available in Deitel's C# A
Programmers Introduction (the source is available from Deitel.com).

I can't even get the winforms example on the gotmono forums (which is
*really* basic) to run without a stack exception.

I'm using FC2 with the packages available in the mono-all.zip file.

TTFN

Paul
