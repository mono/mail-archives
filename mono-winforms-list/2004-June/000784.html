<PRE>I am trying, really trying, to get winforms working on
my SusE 91 linux box.  From the forums it sound like
that the easiest way was through Red-Carpet.  So I
installed all the mono packages.  I also update wine. 
I have a simple win form that has one button on it. 
When I start it up the form shows then another dialog
shows up, but the 2nd dialog is blank with some
painting uses.  It looks like a diagnostic dialog but
it is not printing out anything.

I am at my end of my rope.  The boss wants to see
something and I can just show him a grey box. NOT
GOOD!!!

Is there a &quot;up to date&quot; document that says how to get
winforms work on Suse 91?  Or what my problems is?
