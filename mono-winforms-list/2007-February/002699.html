<PRE>Hey Everybody,

I have been wanting to contribute in some way and the one thing I personally
thought could further the interests of the Mono community is a great place
for Forums and Blogs and Resources and other things related to Mono. There
are some good sites out there but I thought if everything was centralized,
similar to www.Asp.Net &lt;<A HREF="http://www.asp.net/">http://www.asp.net/</A>&gt;, it could really work.

So with this in mind, I created <A HREF="http://communityasp.net/mono">http://communityasp.net/mono</A> . I want to
make this site the best possible resource I can. It is still rough right now
( I have only been working on it for a day ) but I am willing to put the
work in to make it great.

I would love it if everybody would check it out and tell me what you think.
I would love to have your support in this project, and I hope it is
something everybody could be interested in. If anybody is interested in
helping to manage the site, or has any ideas for the design of the site, I'd
be glad for the help. I want this to be a place where everybody in the
community can be involved.

It is built using Telligent's Community Server. It has the capabilities to
send a newsletter out to all registered members, have forums for anything,
it creates a Blog for anybody that registers so the community can
participate. When you register your Blog will be located at
<A HREF="http://communityasp.net/Mono/Blogs.">http://communityasp.net/Mono/Blogs.</A> It has a File downloads section so the
community can put up any kinds of projects they can come up with to help.
And it has much more.

There will be other sites based from CommunityAsp.Net. I am setting up
<A HREF="http://communityasp.net/winforms,">http://communityasp.net/winforms,</A> <A HREF="http://communityasp.net/opensource">http://communityasp.net/opensource</A> , and
any other sites that could help the .Net community at large. This should
generate some traffic that could bring more attention to the Mono Project as
well, as these sites will all be related and interlinked. When you register
for any of the sites, your login persists between all of them so you don't
have to login differently on each site. If anybody has any ideas for a
sub-site of communityasp.net, I would love to hear about it.

Please tell me what you think.

Thanks,
Austin Winstanley
