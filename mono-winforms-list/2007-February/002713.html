<PRE>Hi all,

We have just uploaded a couple of screencasts showing the Plastic GUI client 
running on OpenSuse / Mono. A VMWare image is also available.

You will see most of the Plastic graphical features running (like switching 
from one branch to another with a right-click, 3D version tree and so on).

It is still a pre-release, because there are some minor problems with 
WinForms, but we are really, really close... :-D

I thought you would like to see it running on Linux/Mono... it looks great! 
Really, the only difference with a Windows/.NET environment is the Linux 
flavour... which is good!!

Find both the screencasts and vmware image at our blog:

Thanks!
