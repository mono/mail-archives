<PRE>You question can be better answered on the gtk-sharp-list mailing list 
than this list.

<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Mailing_Lists">http://www.mono-project.com/Mailing_Lists</A>

There is MonoDevelop which is written in C# and runs on Mono using gtk# 
as the GUI.  It was originally a port of SharpDevelop; however, 
MonoDevelop has changed so much it really doesn't have much in common 
between the two anymore.  Also, MonoDevelop will only run on Linux and 
other unix-like environments.  It does not run on Windows.  This is 
mainly due to some of MonoDevelop's dependencies.
