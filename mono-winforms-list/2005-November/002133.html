<PRE>Hi,

I need 1-bit, 4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit, 24-bit, 32-bit BMP support for
ImageListStreamer as it supports all of them. Currently it's most likely
that I will implement BMP saving entirely in managed code as MS GDI+ has no
support to convert images to indexed pixel formats. Even MS GDI+ LockBits
only has support for some pixel format conversions so I will have to do
conversion in managed code.

Unlike GDI that usually uses masks GDI+ only supports alpha channel so
images has to be stored in Format32bppArgb that requires conversion anyway.

ImageList_Read and ImageList_Write have poor BMP reader and writer
implementations that can be reproduced by preprocessing BMP headers before
GDI+ loads BMPs and modifying BMP headers after GDI+ writes them, but
probably it's easier to do everything using managed code.

Back libgdiplus:
MS GDI+ use the original image data and coverts pixel formats on the fly
when drawing. When using streams it reads pixel data every time you draw a
bitmap.

Using Format32bppArgb internally in libgdiplus can result in better
performance, but I think conversion should be done when loading and saving
bitmaps but Bitmap.PixelFormat should return the original pixel format for
compatibility.

</I>&gt;<i> exterior, appear to be using those different types, but internally, it

</I>&gt;<i> it is what Cairo itself uses (all Cairo supports for many operations, if I

</I>&gt;<i> LockBits/UnlockBits, the code would allocate a second buffer and translate

</I>&gt;<i> would return Format24bppRgb, Format32bppRgb or Format32bppArgb, but
</I>&gt;<i> anything other than Format32bppArgb would result in translations. This is
</I>&gt;<i> actually still the case for non-indexed Bitmap data!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I added to libgdiplus about 10 months ago was support for 1-, 4- and
</I>&gt;<i> 8-bit indexed images. Actually, most of the code was already able to
</I>&gt;<i> handle
</I>&gt;<i> 8-bit images, as it can still compute the pixel size &amp; stride &amp; such in
</I>&gt;<i> terms of the depth &amp; components, but a good amount of additional code was
</I>&gt;<i> required to do stuff like locking misaligned windows of 1- and 4-bit
</I>&gt;<i> images. Just recently, I augmented that original patch with a patch for
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> rotation code (which was previously broken in another way too -- it didn't
</I>&gt;<i> refresh the Cairo surface object, so anything that wasn't simply accessing
</I>&gt;<i> the bits directly would cause a crash). Bitmap.RotateFlip now fully
</I>&gt;<i> supports 1-, 4- and 8-bit images as well as the previously-supported
</I>&gt;<i> 32-bit. In fact, it works better than Microsoft's implementation, which
</I>&gt;<i> has
</I>&gt;<i> an annoying bug for 5 RotateFlipType values with 1-bit images :-) (This
</I>&gt;<i> snags up the test suite when running on Windows, since the original
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft GdiPlus.dll is used instead of libgdiplus, and thus RotateFlip
</I>&gt;<i> produces incorrect images for those combinations! I sent an e-mail to
</I>&gt;<i> Jordi
</I>&gt;<i> about this a couple of weeks ago, but he still hasn't replied...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The pivotal point of my support for 1-, 4- and 8-bit indexed images, apart
</I>&gt;<i> from alignment issues with LockBits, was, in order to make them usable
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> Cairo's drawing functions (such as what Graphics.DrawImage uses ;-), to
</I>&gt;<i> produce translations of 1-, 4- and 8-bit Bitmaps to CAIRO_FORMAT_ARGB32 in
</I>&gt;<i> temporary buffers released after the call completed. If you're planning on
</I>&gt;<i> completing this area, this would probably be the road to go for 15-,
</I>&gt;<i> 16-bit
</I>&gt;<i> bitmaps as well. You would simply need to do another check like I have
</I>&gt;<i> done
</I>&gt;<i> in functions such as GdipDrawImageRectRect, where if the image is not
</I>&gt;<i> already in format CAIRO_FORMAT_ARGB32, a function is called to translate
</I>&gt;<i> the image to that format. Glancing at the Cairo source code, it appears
</I>&gt;<i> that it can natively handle PixelFormat.Format24bppRgb (as
</I>&gt;<i> CAIRO_FORMAT_RGB24), but you will need to do the conversions for 15- and
</I>&gt;<i> 16-bit bitmaps.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hope this helps :-)
