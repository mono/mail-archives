My tests with Invalidate on Microsoft.NET shows one big problem.
If i try to repaint screen as fast as possible i have twice more FPS without 
Invalidate with same CPU usage(100%).
Furthermore if windows is fully hidden, then, if i use Invalidate,  CPU 
usage is 0% and no paint event appears (this is correct), but if part of 
window is showing Invalidate spend CPU time corresponding to square of 
viewable size.
I don't understand why microsoft don't use hardware acceleration in such 
cases.

Is something like this on mono too?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In general, also, Refresh() is preferable to CreateGraphics() for anything
