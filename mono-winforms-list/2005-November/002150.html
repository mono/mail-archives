GTK# works on Windows, and they are porting MonoDevelop to work on
Windows too, see <A HREF="http://www.mfconsulting.com/blog/archives/000106.html">http://www.mfconsulting.com/blog/archives/000106.html</A>
There are also eclipse addins, like one runs boo code.  I'm not sure if 
the C# eclipse addin runs on linux however or not.

That said, I would like to see how to use Tao Opengl's 
SimpleOpenGlControl in windows.forms on linux (needs access to window 
handle), and also how to run similar rich controls like sharpdevelop's
texteditor which needs things like GetCaretPos I think, or
embedding mozilla.
What is needed to support these is available in the xplatuit stuff in 
mwf I think, but I haven't seen examples, and when people have asked it
didn't seem to be part of mwf's goals to support stuff like opengl.
