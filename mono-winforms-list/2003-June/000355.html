<PRE>&gt;<i> I've been trying to get it to work for a while now, but it keeps boiling
</I>&gt;<i> down to #develop needing the .net framework to be installed and the
</I>&gt;<i> framework refuses to be installed on a win95 machine (wine). Wine does have
</I>&gt;<i> an option to emulate windows versions other than win95, but their emulation
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't fool the .net framework installer... #develop does give you the
</I>&gt;<i> option to use mono as it's build and execute runtime, but apparently not to
</I>&gt;<i> run on.
</I>
I played with the .NET installer on Wine a few months ago. Although I
got past that point, the installer kept hitting a problem and rolling
back the install.

&gt;<i> And you're right it will be a great step, i'll chuck windows right out the
</I>&gt;<i> door if that happens.
</I>
Why? What's wrong with using GTK# and Glade for cross platform
development?

I don't really understand what the big deal over SharpDevelop is.... it
will only generate SWF apps right? Which are not especially portable?
And the Win32 widget toolkit is rather primitive in several aspects (no
containment based layout for instance, maybe SWF fixes this).

Would make more sense to use more modern stuff. But maybe if your job
requires it for some reason, then it'd be helpful.
