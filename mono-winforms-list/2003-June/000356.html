<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> I've been trying to get it to work for a while now, but it keeps boi=
</I>ling
&gt;&gt;<i> down to #develop needing the .net framework to be installed and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> framework refuses to be installed on a win95 machine (wine). Wine do=
</I>es
have
&gt;&gt;<i> an option to emulate windows versions other than win95, but their
</I>emulation
&gt;&gt;<i> doesn't fool the .net framework installer... #develop does give you =
</I>the
&gt;&gt;<i> option to use mono as it's build and execute runtime, but apparently=
</I> not
to
&gt;&gt;<i> run on.
</I>
&gt;<i>I played with the .NET installer on Wine a few months ago. Although I
</I>&gt;<i>got past that point, the installer kept hitting a problem and rolling
</I>&gt;<i>back the install.
</I>
What did you do to get the installer to go past the initial OS check ?

&gt;&gt;<i> And you're right it will be a great step, i'll chuck windows right o=
</I>ut
the
&gt;&gt;<i> door if that happens.
</I>
&gt;<i>Why? What's wrong with using GTK# and Glade for cross platform
</I>&gt;<i>development?
</I>
Well, basically 1. I've never used GTK# and Glade and I know SWF. 2. I =
work
for a
MS buddy company and my superiors won't allow us to use non-standard st=
uff.

&gt;<i>I don't really understand what the big deal over SharpDevelop is.... i=
</I>t
&gt;<i>will only generate SWF apps right? Which are not especially portable?
</I>&gt;<i>And the Win32 widget toolkit is rather primitive in several aspects (n=
</I>o
&gt;<i>containment based layout for instance, maybe SWF fixes this).
</I>
No it doesn't. You can write webservices, console apps,
class libs, the whole trip. Allthough if you wanted to write a web serv=
ice
you're not gonna get any nice wizards like with VS.net. But maybe that'=
ll
come
later...

&gt;<i>Would make more sense to use more modern stuff. But maybe if your job
</I>&gt;<i>requires it for some reason, then it'd be helpful.
</I>
Yeah like you said, the job requires it unfortunately. A contracter tha=
t
works here
told me today they are forcing him to use VB.net and apparently they're=

gonna
make that the standard in this company. That's just bloody sad if you a=
sk
me.
I'm just gonna refuse to use it. It's simpler for a VB programmer
to learn C# than vb.net.
