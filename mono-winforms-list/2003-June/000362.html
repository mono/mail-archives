<PRE>Hello Sivakumar,

&gt;<i>     We,Final Year students of Bharathiyar University,Coimbatore-India
</I>&gt;<i> visited your website recently.The mono projects impressed us very much
</I>&gt;<i> and we have already heard about your MONO Projects.We have decided to
</I>&gt;<i> do our final year project in Mono ,that is,to CONTRIBUTE in Just In
</I>&gt;<i> Time(JIT),We have experiences in both  DOT NET(MS) and Linux(RedHat).
</I>&gt;<i>     We have already sent mails regarding this and we are waiting for
</I>&gt;<i> your response for the past two weeks.Give us a positive response so
</I>&gt;<i> that we can start immediately.
</I>
I am glad that you are interested in Mono.

The best way of participating in Mono, like in every other free software
project is to look into an area of your interest and start developing. 
You mention that you are interested in the JIT engine, which part of it
specifically?

There are always more optimizations needed there, but it is not the only
area where you can work on.  You might want to look at our
