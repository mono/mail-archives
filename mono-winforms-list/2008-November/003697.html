Hi im really interested in creating application that are capable of running
in .net and still having the transparency of the doing the same in Mono 2.0.
A basic copy paste form one platform to another.

For the winforms i managed to write everything carefully so that mono can
work with it as well. My issue now is that i cant seem to lay hands on a
embedded database that can run in .net and mono with little issue. 

My project basicaly is to use the Db just to store and read data. NOTHING
heavy! the most complicated is perhaps a Select * from table. :-D
I have used sql server compact, and well mono cant handel it. (Maybe im
wrong or doing something wrong)
also used vistadb and well... the express version of them gives me a &quot;value
cannot be null&quot; when filling a datatable using there dataadapter (I checked,
and all of my objects are none null. Moma tells me that there funtions that
arent implemented in mono, and other that are p/invoke calls.)

Please any help will be apreciated!!
