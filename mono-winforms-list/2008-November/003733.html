Hello everyone!

this week ik made the sitch from XP to ubuntu 8.10, before all that i asked
people on several forums, the question:

if im used to program C# in microsoft visual express. what is the best
program to work with in ubuntu?

many people answered me: monodevelop.

oke, it installed it( it seems that it can handle microsft express solution
Cheesy) and tried, but there are a few things that I cant get fixed. like
develop a user interface. MS &gt; just drop all the tools on the from place it
where you want.double click and code. but in monodevelop I cant get i done,
cant resize objects some messages about widgets (what is that?) and Gtk#
shizzle?

So there are a lot of beginners problems so my question is: are there some
tutorial from people who switched from microsoft studio express to
monodevelop, or just tutorials that explains how i have too use
monodevelop.\?

thanks

Jeltn,

Edit;

little extra question: if i made a Monodevelop project. and i save it. and i
went to school and plug my Harddisk in a M$ system with microsoft visual
studio C#, am i able to edit and work on this project or is ms visual C# not
able to handle monodevelop solutions?
