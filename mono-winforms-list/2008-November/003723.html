Thanks for the pointer.

I had compiled libgdiplus, but I do think that somethings amis with my glib. 
Regardless, WinForms 'magically' works now.  I believe it was related to my
system needing patches (it was quite out of date).  Patching didn't seem to
help, but the next day power went out and when I restarted the machine,
WinForms worked - so perhaps it just needed some patches and a reboot?

Not everything in my GUIs are working yet so I still have some kinks to work
out, but most of what I'm seeing seems pretty self-explanatory.
