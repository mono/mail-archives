Don't mix and match different mono and libgdiplus versions. When you do
so you get a unique combination that no one else use and, probably
unique (as unreproducible) bugs.

all of the above seems very unlikely to require an update.

Like I said don't do this, on any system.

--with-cairo=system is likely to work, but mostly untested (including
Solaris)

--with-text=pango is experimental and NOT complete. If it works you'll
get a few corner case that render better - but a lot of more common ones
are unimplemented. Also it's performance is much slower than the
cairo-based text being used.

Both options are UNSUPPORTED (see libgdiplus README)
