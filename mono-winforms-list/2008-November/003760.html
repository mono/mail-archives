<PRE>JvD a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm new to Mono. I have downloaded and installed Mono2 onto Ubuntu V8.04.
</I>&gt;<i> After that I wrote a small Winforms program adding 100 lines to a listview,
</I>&gt;<i> repeating that for 10 times. Running the program on WindowsXP, adding 100
</I>&gt;<i> lines takes between 15 and 30 msec each time. Running the same program on
</I>&gt;<i> Ubuntu and Mono the first cycle takes 1,5 seconds and the last one even
</I>&gt;<i> takes 15 seconds.
</I>&gt;<i> Can somebody help me in fixing this problem since this performance is way to
</I>&gt;<i> slow for my application.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>How did you install Mono 2 on Ubuntu 8.04? Did you pulled it from 
Jaunty? Because as far as I know, the current Mono version on Ubuntu is 
1.9.1, even if you installed the mono-2.0-devel package. Can you please 
confirm that you are running Mono versi&#243;n 2.0.1 by doing mono --version 
on a console?

I asking because this sound like a double-recursion bug present in older 
versions (up to 1.9.1_2, I think), but not on the current 2.0.1.
I am extensively using ListViews with thousands of items and haven't had 
any speed issue since 2.0.

Regards,
Ernesto
