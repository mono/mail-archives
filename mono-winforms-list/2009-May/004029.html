<PRE>That's even greater news :) Thanks for your effort over TextBox hell.

I lately found that libgdiplus on OSX fails to render characters
with Japanese default font. I wonder if pango-based implementation
may solve the issue (I seem to have filed a bug as #371861).

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> means it will, for the time being, be an option (getting the new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> features) that reduce compatibility.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The &quot;big deal&quot; is that the current work (old mine in SVN and Jonathan
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new patch) use the high-level pango API which is not complete enough for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some of the options offered by GDI+ (including many supported by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> libgdiplus). This means that the code needs to be re-written in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> low-level API before being ready for general consumption.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, this is the case.  There may be a kind of hybrid high and low level 
</I>&gt;<i> approach, but in any case, the low-level API will need to be used.  I 
</I>&gt;<i> did some work with it, and it does have some of its own challenges, but 
</I>&gt;<i> I definitely think it will be possible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> More recently, I've done a lot of work in the winforms code on the 
</I>&gt;<i> TextBox (and its cousins).  There are several issues with the current 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation there that prevent nice text editing with non-Roman 
</I>&gt;<i> languages even with the libgdiplus pango support enabled.  I've done my 
</I>&gt;<i> best to preserve as much of the old architecture as possible, so in my 
</I>&gt;<i> changes to the TextBox it is possible to easily select the old rendering 
</I>&gt;<i> code or the new rendering code at run-time or compile time.  It needs a 
</I>&gt;<i> little more cleaning up before I submit a patch here, however.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've recently taken a new job, so I won't be able to spend as much time 
</I>&gt;<i> working on this project as I have before, but I'd definitely like to see 
</I>&gt;<i> development continue.  Some of my former colleagues I think will be 
</I>&gt;<i> taking on some development in this area as well as it is very important 
</I>&gt;<i> to the group I was with.
