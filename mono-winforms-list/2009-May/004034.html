Thanks.

&#65279;Please make sure the attached patch are readable (by setting the right
MIME type) since the current ones are not [1] so the next time I have
time to review libgdiplus bugs I'll be able to test it quickly.

&gt;<i> I don't want to look pushy, but what do I do to make this problem see a 
</I>&gt;<i> little more attention from developers?  
</I>
&#65279;I'm busy on Moonlight right now and I don't have time to test this
properly at the moment. 

In any case you don't need more attention from developers ;-) but from
testers. &#65279;The sad fact being that libgdiplus is not built, from SVN,
often enough by people to detect many problems prior to releases. Which
means it won't get any serious testing before the 2.6 previews (next
September). With a bit of luck I'll be able to apply and test a few of
libgdiplus patches/fixes before then.

In the past I used to apply locally such changes, for a long time, to
see if I encountered any regression(s). However I'm not running any
SWF &#65279;based (or SD/libgdiplus related) apps these days so that won't
work. But please continue to test your patch and see if any other
developers, like MWF contributors, can help you testing it (and report
any problem).

&gt;<i> Can I cc: decision makers like Miguel or mono-devel-list?
</I>
of course :) however libgdiplus-specific subjects don't often make long
email threads ;-)
