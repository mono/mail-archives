I'm pretty sure the last patch I posted to the list has my latest 
changes to libgdiplus.  I can double check that over the weekend.

</I>
Yes, this is the case.  There may be a kind of hybrid high and low level 
approach, but in any case, the low-level API will need to be used.  I 
did some work with it, and it does have some of its own challenges, but 
I definitely think it will be possible.

More recently, I've done a lot of work in the winforms code on the 
TextBox (and its cousins).  There are several issues with the current 
implementation there that prevent nice text editing with non-Roman 
languages even with the libgdiplus pango support enabled.  I've done my 
best to preserve as much of the old architecture as possible, so in my 
changes to the TextBox it is possible to easily select the old rendering 
code or the new rendering code at run-time or compile time.  It needs a 
little more cleaning up before I submit a patch here, however.

I've recently taken a new job, so I won't be able to spend as much time 
working on this project as I have before, but I'd definitely like to see 
development continue.  Some of my former colleagues I think will be 
taking on some development in this area as well as it is very important 
to the group I was with.
