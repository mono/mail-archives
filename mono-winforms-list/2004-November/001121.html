&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have some questions to add:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> R you planning to join efforts or using some code from the pnet
</I>&gt;<i> implementation?
</I>
It's not easy for several reasons. From a technical point of view their
System.Drawing is far behind ours and the way that they also implemented
it is quite different to our one. 

I do not think that there is a problem is they take our effort and try
to re-use it, if they respect our licensing terms. They are already
doing that for other namespaces.

&gt;<i> Does the pnet implementation of SWF work with mono? Did anyone tried
</I>&gt;<i> to run the pnet implementation with mono?
</I>&gt;<i> How different is now the mono implementation of SWF in comparation
</I>&gt;<i> with the portable.net implementation?
</I>
I think that the best answer if give a try to both and get your own
conclusions.

I strongly believe that for beginning of the next year we will have a
grade of completeness that will allow to run most of basic / medium size
applications that use SWF.

Best Regards,

Jordi,
