&gt;<i> Hi Jackson,

</I>&gt;<i> sounds cool: 82% is ready?
</I>
Class status gives just an indication of how much of the total namespace
is implement but not all the classes require the same effort. It should
be interpreted and an indicator of the amount of work that has been done
or the amount of work that is left.

&gt;<i> But looks like the missing 12% are the realy hard one. Are there any
</I>&gt;<i> screenshots of the already implemented controls in the internet?
</I>
The missing part is not the hard really hard one because we have been
growing organically. There are parts that are trivial to implement that
are not done yet and others that are hard. But we did not leave the hard
ones for the end. For example, all the underlying infrastructure, the
control class, and other stuff is implemented and is not trivial.

Jackson has taken some screenshoots of some of the controls:

Note: the photos of him with girls do not belong to current set of
implemented controls :)

We expect to have a fairly complete version for the beginning of next
year. Notice that this is still an outgoing effort.

Regards,

Jordi,
