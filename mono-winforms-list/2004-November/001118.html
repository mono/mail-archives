<PRE>Hi

&gt;<i> I think, I have red, that you no loger use WineLib as foundation.
</I>
&gt;<i> It it right?
</I>
Sure is.

&gt;<i> What foundation do you use now? Gtk+ or something other?
</I>
Neither

&gt;<i> And why do you no longer use WineLib?
</I>
It was decided that using winelib was like trying to hit a moving target
and as it was too unreliable a solution, it was decided to write a
native implementation which calls a module to the underlying windowing
system - that means that as long as there a module for a platform, then
anyone with a port of the new SWF (it's actually Managed.Windows.Forms
now) on mcs can access it.

&gt;<i> It is so portable like Gtk+, Qt and so on.
</I>
True, but it's forever changing. GTK, Qt etc do bug fixes which are easy
enough to keep up with, winelib is under constant development which is a
different kettle of fish
