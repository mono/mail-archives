<PRE>Sorry about that guys, I accidently attached the wrong file (an old version
of the 
patch).  The attached file is the updated, correct version.

Subject: [PATCH] Patch for System.Windows.Forms.Application to match MSDN
specifications for Application Data

Hello all,

This is first contribution to Mono (and WinForms) so if I'm not necessarily
following protocol, I do apologize.

Attached is a patch for System.Windows.Forms.Application that fixes the
following bugs: 
&#149; In the following properties, MSDN specifies that the directory or registry
key is created if it does not exist 
(Mono only returned the path but did not create them if they did not exist):
o CommonAppDataPath 
o CommonAppDataRegistry
o UserAppDataPath
o UserAppDataRegistry
&#149; This is not documented in MSDN, but .NET handles the CompanyName property
differently than Mono does.
Specifically, if there is no AssemblyCompanyAttribute on the assembly or it
has a empty string value, 
CompanyName returns the name of the EntryPoint of the assembly's Namespace.&#160;
I will try and post a test
case for this later, but since I saw that 1.2.6 was being prepped, I figured
this would be as good a time as 
any to submit these patches.
I can commit these patches to the repo as long as I get the OK from someone
or someone else here can do it (not sure
how this is supposed to work).

Thank you,
Justin Cherniak 

P.S. I'm not sure if it is necessary for Managed.Windows.Forms, but I hereby
release these patches under the MIT X11 Licence.
