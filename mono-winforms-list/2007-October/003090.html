Subject: [Mono-winforms-list] NotifyIcon and ContextMenu redrawing
issues ingnome



Hi all, 

 

I'm not sure if this is the correct mailing list for reporting an issue
such as this, however it seems appropriate. 

 

When creating a test application that contains a windows form, a notify
icon and a context menu, I noticed that the notify icon does not get
redrawn if my context menu overlaps it partially. Other tray
applications (network manager, sound volume) seem to have worked around
the issue by placing their context menus _below_ the icon, instead of at
the place where the mouse click occurs. 

 

I have tried to reassign the same icon to the icon property every
second, so as to trigger a redraw - I just thought of maybe assigning a
different icon every second, haven't tested that yet, will do tonight -,
which had no effect. I also tried making the icon invisible, and then
visible, that works, however it is very noticeable by the user and is
therefore not really usable.

 

I am currently leaning towards finding some 'invalidateRect' function
(which would probably mean going native) or using custom code to place
my context menu below my notify icon. Both of which I think should not
be necessary, as the same code runs correctly on windows/mono. Are there
other applications that use notifyicons out there who have solved this
issue before? Additional info: I'm have seen this on Suse and Ubuntu,
both running in a VM, perhaps it is the vmware vga driver that is to
blame? 

 

Thank you for any help, 

 

Best regards,

Erik Renes.
