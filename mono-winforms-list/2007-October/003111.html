<PRE>Hello all,

This is first contribution to Mono (and WinForms) so if I'm not necessarily
following protocol, I do apologize.

Attached is a patch for System.Windows.Forms.Application that fixes the
following bugs:

   - In the following properties, MSDN specifies that the directory or
   registry key is created if it does not exist
   (Mono only returned the path but did not create them if they did not
   exist):
      - CommonAppDataPath
      - CommonAppDataRegistry
      - UserAppDataPath
      - UserAppDataRegistry
   - This is not documented in MSDN, but .NET handles the CompanyName
   property differently than Mono does.
   Specifically, if there is no AssemblyCompanyAttribute on the assembly
   or it has a empty string value,
   CompanyName returns the name of the EntryPoint of the assembly's
   Namespace.  I will try and post a test
   case for this later, but since I saw that 1.2.6 was being prepped, I
   figured this would be as good a time as
   any to submit these patches.

I can commit these patches to the repo as long as I get the OK from someone
or someone else here can do it (not sure
how this is supposed to work).

Thank you,
Justin Cherniak

P.S. I'm not sure if it is necessary for Managed.Windows.Forms, but I hereby
release these patches under the MIT X11 Licence.
