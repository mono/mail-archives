<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>if you want to run it on mac do the following
[On windows]
-create a new file &quot;BuildMac.bat&quot; in the same directory of your exe file
-inside the file type this:
PATH=&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Mono-2.10.4\bin&quot;;%PATH%
macpack -n:YOURAPPNAME -a:YOURAPPEXEFILE -o:. -m:winforms

-replace YOURAPPNAME with the name for your application you want to see on
mac. example &quot;Painter&quot;
-replace YOURAPPEXEFILE with the name of your exe file. example
&quot;Painter.exe&quot;

then save the file and double click it..
this will create something called MacPackage which is a folder structure
contains your exe and 
script that modifies some settings for your app to work on mac.

I assumed you're using winforms since you're new to mono, but if you're
using Gtk# then
-replace winforms with cocoa

now, you just copy the newly created mac package and run it on mac after you
install mono framework, that's all.

Note: winforms is very bad on mac, use Gtk# instead.beleive me you'll do so
after you've pulled all
your hair off.
