<PRE>Hi, Dan,


Thanks Baltasar,
&gt;<i> Since it's deprecated, what do you suggest I use instead?
</I>&gt;<i>

Ufff... here be dragons.

Winforms would be ideal if it was finished, since you would not have to
write any other code. Unfortunately, it is not. Take into account that
there is not support for WPF.

Okay, probably the best graphic toolkit available, when talking about
completeness, for C#/mono, is Gtk#. Gtk# is able to show windows and
graphics of any kind (Cairo), in Windows, Mac and Linux. It's a good
option, I think the best one currently, though it is also maybe
temperamental and capricious in how to show widgets to the user (it thinks
it knows better than you). Since you would paint in the window canvas
though Cairo, I think you're safe, though. You also have an installer for
each platform.
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/docs/gui/gtksharp/tutorials/">http://www.mono-project.com/docs/gui/gtksharp/tutorials/</A>

You can use Stetic, included in the MonoDevelop/Xamarin Studio environment,
or still use Visual Studio if you're ready to code the GUI by yourself
(this what I personally recommend).

QtSharp is cool, since it gives you access to Qt, a great toolkit, for C#.
However, I don't know how easy is to distribute a cross-platform
application with it.
<A HREF="https://github.com/ddobrev/QtSharp">https://github.com/ddobrev/QtSharp</A>

Xwt is an effort to create a truly toolkit which is native for each
platform. I don't know about its maturity, though.
<A HREF="https://github.com/mono/xwt">https://github.com/mono/xwt</A>

As you can see, there are lots of options, none of them totally good. I'd
stick to Gtk#: either create a specific UI for Linux, or even replace your
curent view with a Gtk# one, which will be cross-platform. I mean, provided
you are ready to &quot;re-code&quot;.

Anyway, you app with Cairo (included with Gtk#) could be interesting.
