<PRE>I don't understand how WinForm can be deprecated?

The whole point is to get to easily cross-platform deployment and fracturing the GUI element wrecks that capability.

I was gearing up to work on a Wayland back-end to WinForms ... is this a lost cause now?

Thanks a million, this is probably what I'll do in the future.

Thanks again,
Dan

Hi, Dan,


Thanks Baltasar,
Since it's deprecated, what do you suggest I use instead?

Ufff... here be dragons.

Winforms would be ideal if it was finished, since you would not have to write any other code. Unfortunately, it is not. Take into account that there is not support for WPF.

Okay, probably the best graphic toolkit available, when talking about completeness, for C#/mono, is Gtk#. Gtk# is able to show windows and graphics of any kind (Cairo), in Windows, Mac and Linux. It's a good option, I think the best one currently, though it is also maybe temperamental and capricious in how to show widgets to the user (it thinks it knows better than you). Since you would paint in the window canvas though Cairo, I think you're safe, though. You also have an installer for each platform.
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/docs/gui/gtksharp/tutorials/">http://www.mono-project.com/docs/gui/gtksharp/tutorials/</A>

You can use Stetic, included in the MonoDevelop/Xamarin Studio environment, or still use Visual Studio if you're ready to code the GUI by yourself (this what I personally recommend).

QtSharp is cool, since it gives you access to Qt, a great toolkit, for C#. However, I don't know how easy is to distribute a cross-platform application with it.

Xwt is an effort to create a truly toolkit which is native for each platform. I don't know about its maturity, though.
<A HREF="https://github.com/mono/xwt">https://github.com/mono/xwt</A>

As you can see, there are lots of options, none of them totally good. I'd stick to Gtk#: either create a specific UI for Linux, or even replace your curent view with a Gtk# one, which will be cross-platform. I mean, provided you are ready to &quot;re-code&quot;.

Anyway, you app with Cairo (included with Gtk#) could be interesting.
