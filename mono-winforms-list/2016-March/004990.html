<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand how WinForm can be deprecated?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The whole point is to get to easily cross-platform deployment and
</I>&gt;<i> fracturing the GUI element wrecks that capability.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Well, I'm not a Mono Team authority, but yes it is.
You can find an e.mail thread in which Miguel de Icaza reports that
WinForms is buggy and incomplete:

&quot;Hey,

Mono has an implementaiton of Windows.Forms, but it is both old,
unmaintainted and known to have some bugs.

Some people have been able to use it effectively, but we do not currently
have an active maintainer, so we encourage developers to pick something
like Gtk# instead.&quot;

I've been unable to find something like that quoted text in the oficial
mono pages for WinForms... due to this, people will continue to try to use
it as a valid asset.

&gt;<i>From what other people has been reporting here, using WinForms in a Mac is
</I>a complete nightmare, so you can only create cross-platform apps for Linux
and Windows, in any case, while Gtk# works for all three platforms.


&gt;<i> I was gearing up to work on a Wayland back-end to WinForms ... is this a
</I>&gt;<i> lost cause now?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I will answer that in a generic way: if the use you have to make of
WinForms is valid for your application, then you can do it. But if you find
something that does not work, then you're lost and alone.
