Hello,

I'd use the System.Windows.Forms.TabControl control, if only it didn't have
the following shortcomings:

1) There is no (easy) way to get rid of the dashed rectangle on the focused
tab
2) The tabs flicker on resize, especially a TreeView contained in the
TabControl (which doesn't flicker if not inside a TabControl)

About point 1, I guess I could focus a control inside the TabPage whenever a
new tab is focused, but that's a bit hacky... Mono doesn't show the focus
rectangle, but that's a bug that should be fixed (I just reported it along
with other tab bugs: <A HREF="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=515045">https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=515045</A>).

And about point 2, I read an article
(<A HREF="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/winforms/thread/aaed00ce-4bc9-424e-8c05-c30213171c2c">http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/winforms/thread/aaed00ce-4bc9-424e-8c05-c30213171c2c</A>)
that gives a tip to fix that, which works but introduces drawing problems
with my double-buffered Panels (not to mention that with my application, it
triggers an exception using Mono). On a side note, the flickering isn't as
bad with Mono, it's bearable.

So, in the end, rather than fixing these TabControl issues, I'm starting to
think using a custom TabControl (which I guess shouldn't inherit from
TabControl to avoid the issues above, but directly from UserControl) is the
way to go.

Is there a free and open-source custom TabControl that does this? And Mono
friendly, ie: no P/Invokes. I need no extra functionality other than that.

PS: that kind of issue makes me think GTK# would probably be less annoying
to work with. :D
But for this particular project, I'd like to keep using WinForms.
