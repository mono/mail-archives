Hi Andrea,

Flash on linux is a nsapi plugin that you often have to install for
yourself. You should I think be able to run firefox in this control,  so
i would think that if your normal firefox can run flash, then your
control running as the same user will be able to aswell.

Are you trying to use gecko or webkit?  Does your flash app run normally
on firefox?

Regards

Ian
