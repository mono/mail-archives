So once that final bug is resolved and there is a consensus that WinForms
works as designed, what are the plans, if any, to simplify the packaging and
deployment processes.

It's been awhile since I've tried to run Mono on Linux and I don't think
I've ever seen MonoDevelop functioning properly. I don't think I've ever
been able to cleanly install Mono in a Linux environment without needing to
know how to resolve dependencies (which can spiral out of control quickly).

I think the question I'm asking is this. Will Mono ever be packaged so that
a non-Linux developer, say a VB 6 developer or less-experienced C#
developer, might be able to throw RedHat, Fedora, Suse, or Debian up on a
computer and quickly start creating usable and cross-platform programs that
can be easily deployed?

This would be my goal. Get those VB programmers interested. Get the guy that
writes software for mom and pop businesses interested.
