<PRE>Yes indeed Ubuntu does handle dependencies well.

I currently have the setup as follows:

Use Synaptic to install mono/monodevelop/class library. (Makes
everything integrate nicely with the GUI, launching of apps, etc.)
Get the mono source, rebuild, and then install over top of the
Synaptic mono installation.
Rebuild each day, if no errors, install again.

The only problem I had was that I needed to specify the install path
for mono, I think it was /usr, but I'm not sure.

I've been following Monodevelop progress for a while, and it's really
getting good! My all time favorite time saver is code completion, and
with the latest release, it got a lot better. It still has some
quirks, but most have been fixed. GUI development had some
improvements too. When all the files/dlls finally get cached in
memory, Monodevelop speeds along nicely. I develop all of my cross
platform apps with monodevelop now.

So to answer your question, yes I believe that it is currently
possible to quickly develop cross platform apps right now. As for
packaging mono/develop, I don't see why the next release wouldn't let
you do as you describe. As I see it, the current release seems to fit
your case too.
