Subject: Oh god please no

I would have someone pick  their locks every night but never steal anything  making them think they left them unlocked.   I would pay  someone to  walk into  the bathroom before them  and remove all but one square of toilet paper from the  stalls.  I would unbalance their paper towel holder so when they went  to rip off  a piece the  paper towel holder would fling across the room instead.  I would  drill out all their  salt shakers so salt  would come out really  quick.    I  would pay people to  drive really  slowly in  front of  them.   I would pay 300 people to  call him  one  time  each and ask for Hank in a deep southern accent over a  long  period of time.
