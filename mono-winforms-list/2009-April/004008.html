Hi all again!

I'm not posting this to the bug report, because there might be quite a 
discussion about this patch.

After in-depth research I've come to conclusion that to fix alpha
blending code in all cases:

- mask image loaded from file
- mask bitmap created in memory (in ARGB or PARGB pixel format):
   a. data set with SetPixel
   b. data set using System.Drawing.Graphics drawing primitives

or any combination of the above, we need to ensure coherency in
bitmap's pixel format (ARGB or PARGB) and actual bitmap data in scan0.

Currently, PARGB is never reported by libgdiplus (unless it's user's
bitmap explicitly created with such pixel format).  But bitmap data is
in PARGB format in the following cases:

- 32bpp ARGB image loaded from png file
- image created with Graphics drawing primitives

If we manage to have the bitmap data in order with reported pixel
format we'll only need to add pre-multiplication code in a several
places where it's currently missing (GdipDrawImageRectRect,
draw_clamp_texture, etc.).

Most infamous is that we have to convert bitmap data to PARGB and
change it's PixelFormat before any drawing by cairo is done.

To see why it is so, consider this code which draws the same
transparent green line from the left-top to the right-bottom corner of
the bitmap:

Color color = Color.FromArgb(127, 0, 255, 0);

Bitmap bmp1 = new Bitmap(32, 32);
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 32; ++i)
     bmp1.SetPixel(i, i, color);

Bitmap bmp2 = new Bitmap(32, 32);
using (Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage(bmp2))
     using (Pen p = new Pen(color, 1))
         g.DrawLine(p, 0, 0, 31, 31);

Console.WriteLine(&quot;bmp1[15, 15]: {0} ({1})&quot;, bmp1.GetPixel(15, 15), 
bmp1.PixelFormat);
Console.WriteLine(&quot;bmp2[15, 15]: {0} ({1})&quot;, bmp2.GetPixel(15, 15), 
bmp2.PixelFormat);

In the current version we'll get

bmp1[15, 15]: Color [A=127, R=0, G=255, B=0] (Format32bppArgb)
bmp2[15, 15]: Color [A=127, R=0, G=127, B=0] (Format32bppArgb)

which is plain wrong.

The PixelFormat of bmp2 is Format32bppArgb right after the bitmap is
created.  But after we draw a line on it the bitmap data is actually
in PARGB format because cairo works that way.

If we now try to draw these &quot;mask&quot; bitmaps on two empty &quot;canvas&quot;
bitmaps, we're doomed to get different resulting images.  The first
bitmap needs pre-multiplication before drawing with cairo and the
second one doesn't.  To corretly handle this situation we ought to
change bmp2's PixelFormat to PARGB.

However, it's not enough to just change the reported pixel format of
the bitmap.  In a more complicated case where drawing techniques are
mixed in the same bitmap we'll need to adjust image data before
drawing with Graphics.

Consider this code which draws a semi-transparent white rectangle in
the top half of the bitmap using Bitmap.SetPixel and the same color
rectangle at the bottom half using Graphics.FillRectangle:

Color color = Color.FromArgb(127, 255, 255, 255);

Bitmap mask = new Bitmap(32, 32);
for (int y = 0; y &lt; 16; ++y)
     for (int x = 0; x &lt; 32; ++x)
         mask.SetPixel(x, y, color);

using (Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage(mask))
     using (SolidBrush b = new SolidBrush(color))
         g.FillRectangle(b, new Rectangle(0, 16, 32, 32));

Console.WriteLine(&quot;mixedmask: [10, 10]: {0}&quot;, mask.GetPixel(10, 10));
Console.WriteLine(&quot;mixedmask: [20, 20]: {0}&quot;, mask.GetPixel(20, 20));

Now if we run this code, we'll get something like this:

mixedmask: [10, 10]: Color [A=127, R=255, G=255, B=255]
mixedmask: [20, 20]: Color [A=127, R=127, G=127, B=127]

No matter if we pre-multiply the image data before drawing this mask
over background or not, we won't get the correct result.

So the pixel format of ARGB bitmap should be adjusted before any
drawing with cairo on the bitmap is done.  The most appropriate place
for this change to happen I think is the call to Graphics.FromImage().

This might be quite surprising for the user to have bitmap's pixel
format change after using it in Graphics.FromImage, but to remedy this
we would need to adjust all and every drawing primitive to change
bitmap's pixel format to PARGB before the drawing and restore it to
ARGB after that.  Another possibility is to have some internal flag
set when AGRB-&gt;PARGB adjustment is done and then restore pixel format
on the first call to Get/SetPixel.

Both these remedy options seem like overkill to me.  And let's not
forget current users get PARGB format upon loading any alpha-enabled
PNG image and seem to be quite happy about it.

I don't feel very good about such change and if there's possibility to
handle all drawing cases without introducing such subtle semantics,
I'm all ears.

Unfortunately, as is, this patch breaks 6 tests where an icon is
converted to bitmap and ARGB pixel format is expected (it's PARGB
now due to the way Bitmap(Image) constructor works and my change
in Graphics.FromImage).  Currently, I see no easy way to fix this
_and_ preserve the patch semantics, so I believe we can drop these
assertions.  I'm attaching a patch against mcs/class/System.Drawing trunk.

---------------------------------------------------
Here's the list of changes in libgdiplus, per-file:

pngcodec.c: Discarded pre-multiplication when loading 32-bit ARGB
   images.

jpegcodec.c, pngcodec.c: Disabled direct saving of PARGB images,
   reverse pre-multiplication is handled in image.c

alpha-premul-table.inc, general-private.h: Added reverse
   pre-multiplication table for saving images in PARGB pixel format.

   Code to generate the table is attached in
   gen-alpha-premul-rev-table.c

bitmap.c, bitmap-private.h: Added
   gdip_bitmap_format_needs_reverse_premultiplication,
   gdip_bitmap_get_reverse_premultiplied_scan0,
   gdip_bitmap_get_cairo_format_for_surface.

imageattributes.c: Added reverse pre-multiplication in
   gdip_process_bitmap_attributes to handle PARGB bitmaps; changed
   return type to GpStatus as premul. code might fail with OutOfMemory.

image.c, texturebrush.c: Added pre-multiplication where it was
   missing.

image.c: Added gdip_scan0_flip_x/y for better performance in
   DrawImageRectRect (avoid numerous premuls).

   GdipGetImageGraphicsContext will change image pixel format to PARGB
   if needed.

   Added reverse pre-multiplication before saving PARGB images.


When this patch is hopefully accepted I plan to add more unit tests to
cover various drawing methods.
