Hello, I've a very annoying problem with Mono 2.4 that is easy to reproduce:

- When updating an object in the form (a textBox for example) using a
listener or when catching special events like form closing, the form
sometimes completely disappear from screen (but is still present in the
taskbar). Refreshing, Updating or Showing it has does not make it visible
after that. Clicking 1 time in the taskbar icon to minimize it then again to
restore it makes it visible again, but it's really annoying!

I've remarked that this occurs when another form is present in the screen,
and not when the form is alone (see simple example below):

- I create a new Form in VS c# express 2008 (empty, I add nothing to it)
- I bind a function on the FormClosing event:

       private void Form1_FormClosing(object sender, FormClosingEventArgs e)
        {
            if (MessageBox.Show(&quot;quit?&quot;, &quot;quit&quot;, MessageBoxButtons.OKCancel)
== DialogResult.Cancel)
            {
                e.Cancel = true;   // cancel closing the window
            }
        }

This code makes the form disappear sometimes when closing it and clicking
&quot;cancel&quot;.
But this one never makes it disappear:

       private void Form1_FormClosing(object sender, FormClosingEventArgs e)
        {
                e.Cancel = true;   // cancel closing the window
        }


I also experienced this problem as said earlier when updating the textbox of
a form in a listener (TraceListener, that was my log window).

Is there a way to avoid this problem? I found no information on this issue
and it's strange as it's really easy to reproduce but maybe it only occurs
on windows? (only tested mono 2.4 on windows).

This problem is not present in MS.Net


Thanks for your help!

Yohan
