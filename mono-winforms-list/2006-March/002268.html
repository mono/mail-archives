<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt;The clear does as it should, but then won't allow a new number to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;entered. Have I used the correct method or is this a mono problem?
</I>&gt;<i> This was due to a bug in TextBox, not resetting the char count on a Clear(). 
</I>&gt;<i> I just fixed it in svn head.
</I>
Excellent :-) Looks like I'm going to have to move back to the source
version over the FC rpms on the laptop and main box at home. Oh well -
it was fun having the rpms ;-)

&gt;<i> &gt;P.S. Before anyone says, it's not very pleasant to look at when it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;compiled (and executed) and under Linux, the number box event handler
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;isn't doing as it should and rejecting non-numbers
</I>&gt;<i> That bug has already been fixed in svn and marked as fixed in bugzilla.
</I>
Thanks again for that Peter :-)

TTFN

Paul
