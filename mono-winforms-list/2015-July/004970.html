<PRE>Thanks for the quick reply.&#160; Unfortunately I'm new to all of this and I don't know what I'm doing so I'll try to explain
I'm running Windows 7.I downloaded Monodevelop Xamarin StudioWhen I start a project I choose New SolutionFrom there I chose .NET and Gtk# 2.0 ProjectI then select MainWindow.cs opened with Window Designer
I get a form to design and create code for the objects I place on the form. 
When I run the program I get a &quot;Window&quot; that contains all my buttons, etc. 

So that's where I'm at.&#160; 

I've placed a &quot;DrawingArea&quot; object (or widget?) from the toolbox onto the form. 

Now I would like to draw to that drawing area. 

So I need to find some documentation or tutorials on how to do that. 

That's where I'm at. 

So what am I using here?&#160; Is this a Gtk C# window?&#160;&#160; Or a Winform?
And can I use a standard Windows form in this studio?&#160; I used to have Microsoft C# studio and I could draw to a windows forms pretty easily.&#160; But it doesn't seem to work the same in the Monodevelop Xamarin studio. 

I just need to get past this graphics problem and I can get on with writing my code to draw the simulations I want to program. 

I just can't figure out how to draw to the &quot;DrawingArea&quot; object, or widget? 
I've been looking for a tutorial on how to do that and I couldn't find one. 

Thanks

 Hello,

You should either use WinForms or GTK#, not both.
If you want to use WinForms, then you should draw using GDI+, the same way you would in .NET.
If you want to use GTK#, then you should draw using GDK (<A HREF="http://docs.go-mono.com/?link=T%3aGdk.Pixbuf">http://docs.go-mono.com/?link=T%3aGdk.Pixbuf</A>).


RoboPi wroteHello,

I'm looking for help or tutorials on how to draw to a drawingarea on a Windows Form using C# in Xamarin Studio. &#160;I just need to draw simple shapes, line, rectangles, circles, and be able to fill them in with color. 

A simple sample code would be great.

I haven't been able to find anything on YouTube or Google. 
Any help will be greatly appreciated.
Thank you,
James
