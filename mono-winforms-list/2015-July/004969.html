<PRE>Hello,

I know I'm a bit late, but just in case, I'll reply anyway.

What I'd do is retrieve the Mono WinForms source code, then hack away to
figure out what's wrong... Then you can just swap the Mono WinForms DLL with
the one you built. Getting the WinForms project to build can be tricky,
though (haven't tried lately).

&gt;<i> Hi there,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have a Windows Forms custom control assembly which I have authored that
</I>&gt;<i> does not run under Mono and I&#8217;m stuck trying to figure out why.  I have
</I>&gt;<i> provided a link to the testbed exe and the DLL below.  Both target
</I>&gt;<i> Framework 2.0.  The DLL has a custom splitter, group bar, and navigation
</I>&gt;<i> bar that I have authored.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.ryanrogers.com/monotest.zip">http://www.ryanrogers.com/monotest.zip</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have ran both the DLL and EXE through Mono Analyzer and there were no
</I>&gt;<i> issues found.  Of course, I make no p/invoke calls or anything like that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have compiled under VS 2010 as well as Mono.  No warnings or errors
</I>&gt;<i> compiling with either.  I used the CSC.exe syntax out from VS and ran it
</I>&gt;<i> through the Mono compiler.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, it doesn&#8217;t matter whether I run the MS-compiled assemblies of the
</I>&gt;<i> Mono-compiled assemblies.  In both cases I see a stack overflow warning
</I>&gt;<i> (when run with &#8211;verbose), and the UI never launches.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Everything runs fine using the MS runtime.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have tried both the &#8220;latest&#8221; and &#8220;stable&#8221; builds of Mono, and get the
</I>&gt;<i> same result.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;m new too Mono, but a .Net veteran.  How do I get more info out of Mono
</I>&gt;<i> so that I can tell what is causing the problem?  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know it&#8217;s my NavBar / GroupBar control that is causing the issue, as
</I>&gt;<i> when I remove their creation from the testbed exe, it launches.  So
</I>&gt;<i> something these controls are doing is causing an issue, but I have no idea
</I>&gt;<i> what, and am not sure the best way to diagnose this using Visual Studio. 
</I>&gt;<i> They are quite complex controls so I need some way to diagnose this.  Do I
</I>&gt;<i> need to be running MonoDevelop?  Was hoping to avoid that...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are there some log files or logging options I'm overlooking?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any help or pointers would be most appreciated!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Ryan
