<PRE>
my project also built without changes and I was pleasantly surprised!

That was under fedora 7. Now under Fedora 8, I get a message when using

the System.Windows.Forms reference!

I checked updates to no avail!

Could be something missing in &quot;yum update&quot;

Which distro do you use?

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [Mono-winforms-list] Kudos Called For
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm a long-time Win32 veteran who's been working as a
</I>&gt;<i> winform/webservice/tools developer since .NET 1.0.  My company adopted
</I>&gt;<i> the new paradigm and the C# language for our flagship product
</I>&gt;<i> development back when a lot of folks couldn't even spell .NET, let alone
</I>&gt;<i> know what it was, and I've been at it full-time for six years now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When I first heard about mono, I loved the idea of an OS implementation,
</I>&gt;<i> but after checking in on its progress from time to time, I got the
</I>&gt;<i> feeling that it wasn't going anywhere very fast.  I figured that someday
</I>&gt;<i> mono might be useful for writing Linux console apps, using the GNU
</I>&gt;<i> equivalent of Microsoft's command-line compiler, but I didn't really
</I>&gt;<i> hope to see much more than that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With vacation time on my hands, and a newly-built x64 system running
</I>&gt;<i> openSuSE 10.3 to play with at home, I decided to take another look, and
</I>&gt;<i> I have to say that I'm amazed.  Truly amazed. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I decided to check it out with a fairly substantial winform application
</I>&gt;<i> called TimeLine, that I wrote to keep track of time spent on tasks at
</I>&gt;<i> work and submit weekly reports to a supervisor.   It's not a trivial
</I>&gt;<i> application.  I simply copied the solution from my XP-Pro workstation to
</I>&gt;<i> a Samba share on my Linux machine (I didn't have remote cvs set up yet),
</I>&gt;<i> told monoDevelop to &quot;build solution,&quot; and damned if it didn't build
</I>&gt;<i> as-is.  And then my application RAN, with only a trivial adjustment
</I>&gt;<i> needed to make it perfect.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So congratulations to everyone here who had anything to do with getting
</I>&gt;<i> this all to the state where it is today!  I look forward to becoming
</I>&gt;<i> personally active in OS development in the coming years -- something
</I>&gt;<i> that never really interested me much before now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Jerry Houston
</I>&gt;<i>     Vertafore Corporation
</I>&gt;<i>     Bothell, WA
