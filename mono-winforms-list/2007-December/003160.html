<PRE>There is a mono VMWare recording in the download section of the web site.
  It includes sharpchess.exe that runs under mono, it also includes &quot;ported&quot; source code.
   
  typing make compiles to completion, no problem.
   
  I did this useing the free vmwera player and the mono vmwear recording in a suse 10.2 windows on my normal windows machine.
   
  That might be a goo dplace to start, especally if you normaly use windows.
  I assume the vmware player will also work on any version of linux 
   
  If you need info on the vmwear recordings, let me know.
   
  The sharpchess.exe on the sharpchess web site shows no issues when examaned by Moma, so it should run fine on Mono.

  Hi Aatdark,

The source of my problems at this point is mono.  I've installed mono and monodevelop on this Debian box (running KDE), downloaded the SharpChess source code, opened that project in MonoDevelop, and attempted to run it without changing anything.  I realize it's probably naive of me to think it might work right out of the box like that, but I thought I'd give it a try.  I receive the following error which is quite beyond me, though it makes me wonder if perhaps what I need to do is install some more libraries:

Build: 1 error, 0 warnings

For the record, on the advice of another member of this list, I attempted to install mono* but could not, receiving the following error: 

  Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable 
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.

Since you only requested a single operation it is extremely likely that
the package is simply not installable and a bug report against 
that package should be filed.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies.
  batmon.app: Depends: gnustep-back0.11 (&gt;= 0.11.0) but it is not going to be installed 
              Depends: libgnustep-base1.13 (&gt;= 1.13.0) but it is not going to be installed

  wmclockmon: Depends: libglib1.2ldbl (&gt;= 1.2.10-18) but it is not going to be installed
E: Broken packages

Note that this is after updating everything, in some cases, to an unstable version.  (Before, when I had updated everything to only the most recent stable version, I was unable even to install monodevelop.)  

An alternative solution I was thinking of was embedding a program like xboard within a mono program that could send key presses to xboard and receive mouse movements and clicks from the user.  I'm not sure if that would be more or less complicated. 

Your help is much appreciated!

  Hi
is the source of your troubles mono or c#?
If it is c# you need to read a few c# .net tutorials.

If mono .. what is your current problem? IDE ? compiler ?
