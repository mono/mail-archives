I dont have it any more.  I re-tested and the issue appears to be fixed
on 10.5.2, however its worth noting that the BadMatch error codes you
were returning were undocumented in any public X sources I could find.
This is probably not best-practice.

We will ensure that we do that in the future.  Thanks.

</I>
How closely do these track to release versions, or is it a seperate
trunk?  While updated packages are interesting for me, we @ Mono do our
best to support shipped versions on OSX back to 10.3 even still.  We are
likely dropping binary support for 10.3 in the near future, but that
leaves us still having to support your ancient 10.4 builds as well.
