<PRE>&quot;What is the resx entry for the Cursor you tried in your example?&quot;
What do you mean? You should have everything you need in the solution
attached to the bug report.

&quot;Any ideas of where I might be able to post this to verify such a premise
and/or elevate it as a bug?&quot;
Well, I already reported the bug, so if it's the same one, there's no need
to report anything else. But you may post extra info on the bug report. It
may also help to bring up this issue on more popular mailing lists, such as
Mono - Dev. And you might want to  check out the ResourceManager class 
(<A HREF="https://github.com/mono/mono/blob/master/mcs/class/corlib/System.Resources/ResourceManager.cs">https://github.com/mono/mono/blob/master/mcs/class/corlib/System.Resources/ResourceManager.cs</A>),
or related classes...

I don't think I'll be able to help much, but feel free to ask for more info
if needed.

</I>&gt;<i> process (especially considering it shouldn't be necessary to
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;workaround&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I get the feeling the issue is in how it's handling/converting
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64

</I>&gt;<i> types when it tries to digest the resources.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any ideas of where I might be able to post this to verify such a premise
