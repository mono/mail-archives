<PRE>Sounds like your case is pretty much exactly the same case.  In my case I
find that it fails with Images as well as Icons (where the Cursor is
effectively the same as an Icon).

What is the resx entry for the Cursor you tried in your example?

What I did with that GetBMPImage Function is essentially the same as your
workaround, however, in my case, I have waaaay too many forms with images
and icons in this manner to try to replace them all with this sort of
process (especially considering it shouldn't be necessary to &quot;workaround&quot;).

I get the feeling the issue is in how it's handling/converting

application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64

types when it tries to digest the resources.

Any ideas of where I might be able to post this to verify such a premise
and/or elevate it as a bug?  It seems like it would be a fairly common
problem for ANY Windows Forms application generated from Windows to *NIX
and/or Mac.
