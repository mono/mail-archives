Hi,

Many moons ago I developed a piece of code on a completely different
operating system. It was quite a funky piece of code and I'd like to
re-release it as a winform application. Problem is that it had a very odd
thing on the window.

The software was a graphic carousel package, so there was a fast forward,
rewind, stop etc system attached to the window which looked like this

+-----------------------------------------------+
|<i> Picture title                            X |
</I>+-----------------------------------------------+
|<i>                                                 |
</I>|<i>                                                 |
</I>|<i>  piccy                                       |------|
</I>|<i>                                                 |  &gt;&gt;  |
</I>|<i>                                                 |       |
</I>|<i>                                                 |  &lt;&lt; |
</I>|<i>                                                 |       |
</I>|<i>                                                 |   #  |
</I>|<i>                                                 |       |
</I>+-----------------------------------------------+-----+

The bit on the right was attached to the window as a borderless panel. If
the picture was too large, it was scaled to fit, but the panel then appeared
inside of the window. Window moved, so did the panel.

I did think of creating a panel, attaching it to the window and then adding
an event so that when things moved, resized etc, the panel moved with it.
However, this is problematic.

Is this sort of thing possible using a winform or do I need to rethink my
UI?

TTFN

P.S. Sorry if the ASCII art gets messed up - I'm having to use webmail until
my main box is fixed
