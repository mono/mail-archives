What are the benefits of having the right panel be out of the main window?
Can it be moved independently or something? What would happen when
maximizing the app (unless you disabled maximizing)?

Wouldn't it be easier to just have the panel *inside* the main form, docked
right?
Or even as a thin top bar, so the width of the picture is never a problem.

</I>&gt;<i> The bit on the right was attached to the window as a borderless panel. If
</I>&gt;<i> the picture was too large, it was scaled to fit, but the panel then
</I>&gt;<i> appeared inside of the window. Window moved, so did the panel.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I did think of creating a panel, attaching it to the window and then
</I>&gt;<i> adding an event so that when things moved, resized etc, the panel moved
</I>&gt;<i> with it. However, this is problematic.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is this sort of thing possible using a winform or do I need to rethink my
