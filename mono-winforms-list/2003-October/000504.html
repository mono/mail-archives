<PRE>Hi,

I have been following both the wine-devel and mono-winforms lists for some 
time now. Normally I try to forward important wine related discussions to 
wine-devel but didn't have time for that last week. (couldn't access my 
mail..)

I will forward the gdiplus discussion to the wine lists. I think they will be 
very interested in a gdiplus implementation using Cairo. It is likely that in 
the near future even other parts of Wine will move over to Cairo 
(&quot;dibengine&quot;) but that is something else.
