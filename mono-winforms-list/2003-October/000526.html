<PRE>Please be prepared for extremely stupid questions as I start to understand the environement i am working on (2 days and counting).

I have Redhat 9.0, Gnome, Wine, Mono, Gtk, a baby called Xavier, a black cat and possibly one or two other things i didn't know were there.

I started with a simple WinForms C# example which i created in Visual Studio .Net and compiled both in Windows and then using mcs under linux. The exe created under windows runs under mono in linux as does the mcs compiled version under linux. It also runs under windows (which is very cool btw!).

Next i created a simple app that pops up a messagebox. Works great on windows, but under Mono/Linux i don't get a messagebox. It seems to fire an event &quot;Control Notification Code 0 Id = Hwnd 65571&quot;, but the messagebox itself never appears.

Having looked around i saw some examples where folk used &quot;glade&quot; (?) and even gtk# (?). However is it possible to just run the mono C# app under linux and get the messagebox to show up?

Cheers,
Steven.
