<PRE>Well, after almost giving up, i decided to push on one last time and try to=
 get things working. I managed to get the winform version working *eventual=
ly* with a LOT of fiddling (how i miss setup.exe !!). So much so that i wil=
l have to try to re-trace exactly what i did.

I ran the install mono wine setup from
<A HREF="http://www.nullenvoid.com/mono/wiki/index.php/MonoWinePackages">http://www.nullenvoid.com/mono/wiki/index.php/MonoWinePackages</A>

I found that it was looking for the hidden .wine directory in my home direc=
tory, but it wasn't installed there - it was in some other folder (etc i th=
ink). I copied that entire directory to my home dir and ran the app and it =
seems to work. The results of my first hello world winform are shown below.

&lt;blurb&gt;
So, yes, i'm glad i got this working, but not having used Unix sincein the =
early 90's and now trying Linux after working on Windows ever since, i see =
a lot of work to be done before this is prime time. I feel lucky that i act=
ually got the right combination to get it working, but it is far simpler on=
 Windows. RPM's are a step in the right direction, but installing packages =
for different flavours and versions of the OS from a number of sites on the=
 web with a hash of other dependencies really is a pain. This isn't having =
a go at any OS or platform or anything, just an opinion having spent the la=
st while trying to get this stuff running!
&lt;/blurb&gt;

I am going to try to fire up a &quot;install guide&quot; from people who know zilch a=
bout Unix/Linux, but want to test their C# apps on Mono. Will post a link i=
f i get it done anytime soon.

Now onto &quot;Hello ASP.Net&quot; :)
