<PRE>One of the great things about Mono is that you can put a few files and
assemblies on memory stick and have .NET applications that run without
the need for a .NET Framework (or Mono) installation.

 

Thinking it would be great to have a portable version of Query Analyzer
I looked at several .NET implementations.  However none would work with
Mono and thought one of these might be useful for testing purposes.

 

QASharp is available from Code Project.  Although the code isn't great,
it does things that challenge the SWF implementation.  I've read the
status page and am aware that the comments below will be caused by
implementations that are not complete.

 

1)       the ImageListStreamer doesn't want to read the images for the
application's ImageList control

2)       ActiveMdiClient is not implemented (though Mdi windows do not
seem to work at all for this application)

3)       RichTextbox properties are missing from the RTB implementation
(even as stubs)
