</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Yes, this is because GraphicsExpose is designed exactly for that 
purpose. It is fired when a destination area can't be copied (XCopyArea) 
to because the source area is obscured. I still fail to see why we need 
special obscured-areas-checking logic when we can just handle that message.

I do understand that if we do indeed handle the GraphicsExpose message 
we stand the problem that it might get delayed (X11 message roundtrip 
time) until after we perform the next ScrollWindow/XCopyArea, so because 
the destination area (for the previous ScrollWindow call) won't be 
repainted yet we will copy that garbage from it to the next offset.

However we currently have an explicit AddExpose just after the 
XCopyArea, so we are working around this problem by forcing a repaint on 
the queue, so that we are guaranteed to be repainted prior to the next 
ScrollWindow. And this just-works (tm) :-)

If we want to handle it &quot;properly&quot; we can either&quot;

1) Flush the paint queue prior to XCopyArea somehow
... or ...
2) &quot;Block&quot; the message queue until we get the last GraphicsExpose for 
the window, invalidate and then &quot;unblock&quot; the message queue.
... or ...
3) Something better

&gt;<i> And also, regarding our code:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * When using composite (Xgl or similar) it's not necessary to do this 
</I>&gt;<i> detection, since the window manager (*it seems*) is doing something that 
</I>&gt;<i> somehow already knows which areas need to get an expose event (in other 
</I>&gt;<i> words: only mwf overlapping detection is needed, not for x top level 
</I>&gt;<i> windows).
</I>&gt;<i> * The new code, at least in my laptop, without using composite, seems to 
</I>&gt;<i> work fine (no performance lost), and don't know if it's because 
</I>&gt;<i> XQueryTree on RootTree returns a minor number of windows (61 with no 
</I>&gt;<i> composite, instead of 89 with composite, using 5 terminals and a gtk+ 
</I>&gt;<i> application, for example).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
This I think is very implementation/environment/window manager/toolkit 
specific. E.g some toolkits/window managers might keep menu windows as 
hidden, but still mapped toplevels. I think this was referred to as one 
of the reason for the huge number of toplevels in some email I saw on a 
mailing list long time ago. Because of the variety of setups out there 
(window managers, toolkits, etc, etc) we can't really know with how many 
toplevels we are going to deal.

To give you an example of the problem - on my GNOME + Metacity desktop 
with a standard set of programs running (Firefox, terminal, pidgin, 
nautilus, thunderbird, etc) XQueryTree returns 228 toplevels.

&gt;<i> So, it seems that we should actually handle GraphicsExpose (which all it 
</I>&gt;<i> involves) *or maybe* try to detect if we are using composite - if we 
</I>&gt;<i> are, simply don't use this new code, but just do simple calculations, 
</I>&gt;<i> and if we are not using it, do the detection, since it won't harm the 
</I>&gt;<i> performance.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
My personal position on the matter is that short-term (as in for Mono 
2.0) we just handle GraphicsExpose instead of the new code and keep the 
AddExpose after XCopyArea to workaround the timing issue. Long-term we 
can look into adding a proper handling for the delays of GraphicsExpose 
if it's feasible.

&gt;<i> But I woould like people to tell me how this code (2.0 branch or trunk) 
</I>&gt;<i> behaves for them, in both cases (since I remember that Ivan was having 
</I>&gt;<i> performance problems with the new code even without using composite).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
As I mentioned above with my setup I have 228 toplevels and I get 
garbage everywhere when scrolling on a Core Duo 2 machine.


Tell me what do you think,

Cheers,
