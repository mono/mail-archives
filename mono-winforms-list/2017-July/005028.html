Subject: I think it's 36.

I  dunno....the  aircraft was flying well outside it's  designed limits, so the  on  board computer would have turned control  over  to the  pilot. It's  rate  of  climb was to extreme for the  designed limits. The weather at  the time was being influenced by the  extreme water temperatures  in a  relatively small  body  of  water.   The  violence within  the atmosphere was obvious to the pilot before  things went to pieces. The SST were well outside  the range  of normal variability....so...I  dunno.  One might think it would  be wise to avoid a so  volatile atmospheric conditions. So did agw cause it?....na....was it part of it.....yup
