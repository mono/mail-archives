Hello,
I'm a .NET developer and a fan of Mono since it makes possible to run
ASP.NET in the Unix world.
Unfortunately, I haven't been able so far to run the most popular ASP.NET
projects on my Mono-enabled server. Many developers don't test their
software properly before deploying. They think &quot;if it works with Visual
Studio it works anywhere&quot;.
I tried to install DotNetNuke and it didn't work at all.
I tried to install ASP.NET SysInfo and it didn't compile because of some
broken file references.
Months ago I tried to run LeonidasP2P but CSS files for themes didn't work.
These are just examples.

I'm then writing this message to offer FREE access to my web server running
openSUSE 11.0 w/Apache2_mod_mono to open source developers to test their
software on Mono too.

If you are an ASP.NET open source developer and you currently work only on
Windows/IIS, please contact me and I'll set up an access for you (using
SSH/SFTP) to my server to test your software on Mono using either xsp2 or
mod_mono, with unlimited access to MySQL database (if needed). You will be
able to see if and how your program works with Mono, and make proper fixes
if needed.

My address is
