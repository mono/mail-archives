<PRE>
I have read a number of articles and forum posts about running ASP.Net with
Mono.  I am being asked by management to provide a component view of the
server processes / components.  I am having a hard time putting that
together from the information I have read.

I know that mod-mono hooks itself into Apache so that any .aspx request is
handed over to mod-mono.  mod-mono then sends a request over to
mod-mono-server over TCP/IP, which is running outside of Apache, to serve up
the page.  I also know that mod-mono-server somehow uses XSP to help it
serve the page to the browser.

The things that I do not understand are:

1. Does XSP actually serve the info back to the browser or does it somehow
hand it back to Apache to return to the browser?

2. Which component (mod-mono, mod-mono-server, XSP) compiles the .aspx?

3. Where do ASP.Net Web Services run?  Apache, mod-mono-server, XSP, ...?

4. Is there some sort of diagram somewhere, that I have not found, that
shows the data / communications / component information for all of this
stuff?

Please, let's not have any posts about, &quot;If you would just read the docs&quot;,
&quot;These are stupid questions&quot;, &quot;That has been covered multiple times in this
forum&quot;, etc.  I have done plenty of reading and searching.  There are
articles out there that contradict each other.  There are also a lot of
articles that simply assume that you already know a lot of stuff.  If I have
not found that Holy Grail article then please point me to it.  I just need
some good old fashioned help from knowledgeable people.

Thanks in advance for the help.
