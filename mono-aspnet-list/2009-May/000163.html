This option sounds definitively interesting, and it would be fine for a
market take up of Mono to allow also &quot;dummy&quot;-Linux users (I'm one of these
;) to deploy easily on Linux too.
The possibility exists, as e.g. I think MindTouch Wiki uses Mono this way (I
hope I am not wrong):

So the idea to bridge win-lin is great, but it is a bit hard for many
willing guys...
