</I>Well, it seems they want to have the cake and eat the cake. Or, in other words, they rather have no 
idea what they are talking about. It's as if you wanted to host ASP.NET on Windows without 
installing .NET and IIS - not possible. I would ask them how they imagine running .NET code without 
.NET environment installed?

&gt;<i> through this site, and saw that you can embed Mono in your applications. 
</I>Yes, you can, but you still need to install Mono, of course. Unless you want to create a bundle, 
which will be a one, huge file with everything needed embedded. Even if you went along that route, 
you'd have to implement your own web server (you could reuse Mono's XSP code, but it's not a 
general-purpose webserver) and unless they pay you really good money, the whole task is not worth it.

&gt;<i> Does this mean I can run my asp.net pages on the Unix machine without them
</I>&gt;<i> doing anything to the server?  If so, can someone please explain how I go
</I>As described above, yes, it is possible. Is it practical? No. But if you insist, you can check this 
repository - <A HREF="http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/viewvc/trunk/gert/">http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/viewvc/trunk/gert/</A> - and hunt for Web tests in there 
which will show you how to host ASP.NET in a stand-alone application. Also, have a look at 
<A HREF="http://www.west-wind.com/presentations/aspnetruntime/aspnetruntime.asp">http://www.west-wind.com/presentations/aspnetruntime/aspnetruntime.asp</A> (old, but still stands). If 
you still want to embed Mono in your C application, take a look at 
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Embedding_Mono">http://www.mono-project.com/Embedding_Mono</A>

&gt;<i> about doing this, I have no idea where to even begin.  I tried to read the
</I>&gt;<i> tutorial on this site, but I am not that advanced of a programmer, I need it
</I>&gt;<i> explained in the simplest terms possible.  Any help would be much
</I>&gt;<i> appreciated.
</I>Well, I would recommend not taking the project unless you can convice them to install Mono (or ask 
them why they don't want to do so and, if they have any concerns, reflect them to this mailing list 
and we'll try to address them one by one)
