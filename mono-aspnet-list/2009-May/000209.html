Hi,

As a test, I'm trying to import some 'precooked' asp.net files into
Monodevelop and running into some snags.

The files (consisting of an aspx, aspx.cs, ascx, ascx.cs set) run fine 'as
is' on an apache localhost server with mod mono2.

However when I try to put them into a M-D solution and hit &quot;build&quot;, I'm
getting errors, for example : &quot;The name `lblTitle' does not exist in the
current context(CS0103)]&quot;

There appear to be significant differences in asp.net code generated by the
M-D templates, and the imported files (from VS 2005, I believe).

I have had some success pasting code snippets from the same source (a
textbook), building and running on M-D's built-in xsp server, and deploying
to a localhost directory for apache2 running mod mono. I had to modify some
of the code, to get it to work in Monodevelop though.

I'm using mono 2.4, and Monodevelop 2.0 (installed from the repos), on
openSUSE 11.1. Incidentally monodoc is broken in Monodevelop, if anyone has
a tip on that.

Any suggestions as to how I should proceed would be most welcome. 

If anyone is interested, the source asp.net can be downloaded from
<A HREF="http://www.apress.com/resource/bookfile/2299">http://www.apress.com/resource/bookfile/2299</A> -- this is a zip file with all
the source code in the book; I am currently trying out Chapter 14,
LinkTable* (4 files).

Thanks!
