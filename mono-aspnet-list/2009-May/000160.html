<PRE>
Like mentioned, I am a windows-based web developer.  Recently, I was
approached about doing a project and the person was insistent on using a
host that uses unix-based servers.  I told them I would prefer to develop
with ASP.net, and was told about the mono project.  Before this, I have
never heard about Mono at all.  Though they have control over this server,
they don't want to install the Mono runtime on the machine.  I looked
through this site, and saw that you can embed Mono in your applications. 
Does this mean I can run my asp.net pages on the Unix machine without them
doing anything to the server?  If so, can someone please explain how I go
about doing this, I have no idea where to even begin.  I tried to read the
tutorial on this site, but I am not that advanced of a programmer, I need it
explained in the simplest terms possible.  Any help would be much
appreciated.
