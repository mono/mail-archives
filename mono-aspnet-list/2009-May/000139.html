Hello everyone!

I have a big problem on my server and I trully speaking don't know who is
guilt.
I have an old site hosted by apache + mod_mono and it's woked fine.
Now I discovered beautiful module for Apache which is proxy_module. With
this module I can easily redirect all requests to certain virtual host to
another webserver. It was perfect way to redirect asp.net sites to xsp2
webserver.
I wrote another website and configured it to run through proxy to
<A HREF="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</A>
I started xsp2 --port 8080 in screen and leaved it detached.
Assume I have www.site1.com hosted by mod_mono and www.site2.com hosted by
xsp2.
Now www.site1.com working fine for all pages. By the way this is secured
site which has forms authentication and request login from first page.
When I try www.site2.com I could see index.html of that site. No problems.
But I have www.site2.com/contacts.aspx that should be hosted by xsp2. When I
have tried that address first I've got login form... ooups, but I have no
authentication settings in my web.config for www.site2.com
After it I have added
&lt;authentication mode=&quot;None&quot; /&gt;
&lt;authorization&gt;
&lt;allow users=&quot;*&quot;/&gt;&lt;allow users=&quot;?&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/authorization&gt;
And still I have login request.
After it I realized that login form came from www.site1.com
So I've got URL <A HREF="http://www.site2.com/login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fcontacts.aspx">http://www.site2.com/login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fcontacts.aspx</A>
I knew credentials of site1 I have tried it and I got 404 because
contacts.aspx does not exist on site1
When after it I tried www.site2.com/default.aspx I've got the page... it was
from www.site1.com/default.aspx, without styles of cause.
So it's some kind of mess!

What I've done wrong?

Best Regards,
NickSaves

PS
mono 2.4
xsp2 2.4
