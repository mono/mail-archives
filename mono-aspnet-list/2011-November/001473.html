The web app should restart (by recycling the appdomain) whenever
it detects that one of its dependencies has changed.

Currently, there is no way to shutdown a fastcgi-mono-server
process gracefully.

&gt;<i> Also, I can't find a page to follow the news or the state of

</I>
fastcgi-mono-server is basically unmaintained. It has received
some patches during the last years, but these documentations
and articles still apply.

&gt;<i> If I may ask one last question, how can I run fastcgi-mono-server as an

Well, simply don't run it as root.

&gt;<i> quite sure if mono will respect the setuid flag (haven't tried it yet) and
</I>
It will not. fastcgi-mono-server is just a script that won't pay
attention to setuid.
