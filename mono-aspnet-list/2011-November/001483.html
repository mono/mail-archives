<PRE>Those were my thoughts at first, but the scary thing is that
www.foo.com.tld redirects correctly to foo.com !
I tried putting the rewrite rules outside the context of the virtual host
(more specifically, in the server's context), but if I do that then the
redirects just don't work.
I also tried putting the rewrite commands inside a &lt;Directory
/home/dezege/Website&gt; and inside a &lt;Location /&gt;, both in the server's
context, but still no redirects.
In the end, my only option was putting the redirect instructions inside the
virtual host.
The trouble is that the problem is intermittent, and that it happens even
if I visit foo.com directly (which should be found by Apache, since it is
the ServerName of my main virtual host).
I just want to make sure that this is not a problem with mod-mono not
returning the Content-Type header sometimes, before I go ask to the apache
guys.

I also feel bad that I don't know how to read or generate any logs of
what's happening in the way mod-mono processes requests. Is there a
resource somewhere on mod-mono's logs?

Thanks a lot,

Marcelo Zabani.
