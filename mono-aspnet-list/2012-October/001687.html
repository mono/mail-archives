<PRE>Hello Dan,

Did you finally revert to using the MS stack?

I wonder if the issues described in this thread are still happening to
others :)

By the way, my setup back then also used fluent nhibernate, but I don't
remember the exact version, as it was a year ago.

Sergey.

&gt;<i> An update on where we are with this issue!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The libraries that we are now using are as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> mono 2.10.2
</I>&gt;<i> fluent nhibernate 1.2 (nhibernate 3.1)
</I>&gt;<i> MVC3
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We've spent the past couple of months trying to figure out why our
</I>&gt;<i> applications are leaking memory and have found a few worrying issues. I
</I>&gt;<i> won't go into details about some of the problems we've seen but will
</I>&gt;<i> concentrate on the leaks since they cause the web applications to gradually
</I>&gt;<i> grind to a halt.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I developed a test application (MVC 2 &amp; 3) which contained some simple
</I>&gt;<i> javascript to poll the server very quickly. Monitoring this with the mono
</I>&gt;<i> profiler we found that it never seemed to be garbage collecting the
</I>&gt;<i> CacheItems. However it didn't leak at the same rate as our full web
</I>&gt;<i> applications so something else was going on too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally with a lot of experimentation we have found that if we switch our
</I>&gt;<i> web applications to sessionless (sessionState mode=&quot;Off&quot; in Web.config)
</I>&gt;<i> they
</I>&gt;<i> no longer seemed to leak CacheItems and we found that running nhibernate in
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;thread_static&quot; mode did not seem to leak but &quot;web&quot; did. Since we couldn't
</I>&gt;<i> leave it as thread_static for the web applications we switched to our own
</I>&gt;<i> simplified CurrentSessionContext implementation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With those changes our web applications appeared to no longer leak, but in
</I>&gt;<i> fact the applications stopped leaking when running in XSP and as soon as we
</I>&gt;<i> deploy to mod_mono they happily start chewing up memory again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are also developing a daemon to run alongside the web applications that
</I>&gt;<i> uses the same fluent based data provider as the web application (although
</I>&gt;<i> running in thread_static mode) and the memory usage for that appears to be
</I>&gt;<i> solid, so we know it is not a problem with our data provider
</I>&gt;<i> implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> All the evidence seems to point towards the System.Web related libraries
</I>&gt;<i> (with hints of CacheItem and HashMap thrown in), but we are not familiar
</I>&gt;<i> enough with how it all works to even know where to begin looking, and
</I>&gt;<i> frankly we've wasted too much time on this already.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have been trying to solve these issues for so long now that we're having
</I>&gt;<i> to seriously consider deploying to .NET, despite the fact that we've
</I>&gt;<i> invested a lot of time in building a linux-based server module for the
</I>&gt;<i> daemon and web applications.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we are no longer seeing leaks using XSP, is there a possibility that we
</I>&gt;<i> could deploy our web application using that instead of mod_mono (by setting
</I>&gt;<i> up apache with mod_proxy)?
