If you read through the posts you'll see that Ubuntu apparently sticks with
the less-than-latest version of Mono because of the requirements of several
other packages included in the distribution, and the consensus seems to be
that this is not going to change any time soon.

If you want the a newer version of Mono you have to build it yourself or get
it from an alternate package source. I don't know of any step by step off
hand, but searching on &quot;pmono&quot; may help.

&lt;quote Also if 2.12 is the Latest Stable release then why aren't there any
packages available for it? or is 3.2 the latest stable release? either way
there aren't official packages available for it which is ridiculous.
&lt;/quote&gt;
