<PRE>I would also be interested in hearing any thoughts on FastCGI, mod_mono,
Mono.WebServer, etc. I've gotten a mixed story from blogs and sites like
serverfault, and much of the info may be out of date.

Mainly, I think it would really help to have an up-to-date summary of where
those components are and what needs to be done (if anything) to safely use
them in production. I'd be very willing to take on some tasks if we can
identify what's needed. If anyone knows who could provide a comprehensive
overview of where the different pieces stand, it would really help.

I will browse through the bug database to see what I can find, but it can
be hard to gain a sense of the bigger picture that way.

It sounds like the recent open sourcing of MVC and Razor may re-spark some
interest in this topic as well.
