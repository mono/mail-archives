<PRE>Good to know more people are willing to help!
I also find what you said very relevant: having a picture of the current
state of those projects would be extremely helpful. Can anyone here point
us somewhere?
If we won't be pointed anywhere on this and have to dig our way through bug
reports and other random sources of information, we should inform each
other of what we aim to do.

Anyone with more knowledge on these projects willing to give as a starting
point?
