<PRE>I've spent the last couple of days messing around with various mvc / hosting
/ etc. things and reading forum posts and I haven't been able to find
anything that works, so I thought I'd ask here.

I'm sure this is one of the most commonly asked questions, so my apologies.
Just point me in the right direction~

ok, so let's skip the whole building an mvc application for now, because
I've managed to do that. Got visual studio, created a start project,
compiled it and it's fine (on iis anyway).

The release folder I build has these files:

20      ./bin/MvcApplication1.dll
28      ./bin/MvcApplication1.pdb
52      ./bin
4       ./Views/Home/Index.aspx
4       ./Views/Home/About.aspx
12      ./Views/Home
4       ./Views/Web.config
4       ./Views/Account/Register.aspx
4       ./Views/Account/LogOn.aspx
4       ./Views/Account/ChangePasswordSuccess.aspx
4       ./Views/Account/ChangePassword.aspx
20      ./Views/Account
4       ./Views/Shared/Error.aspx
4       ./Views/Shared/LogOnUserControl.ascx
4       ./Views/Shared/Site.Master
16      ./Views/Shared
56      ./Views
1108    ./Scripts
4       ./Web.config
8       ./Content/Site.css
12      ./Content
4       ./Global.asax

So, now I want to run this under xsp2 to play with it.

So... I run xsp2, and:
Listening on address: 0.0.0.0
Root directory: /home/xs/projects/mono/mvc/sample
Listening on port: 8080 (non-secure)
Hit Return to stop the server.

And then try to go visit it:
--2011-05-06 03:54:44--  <A HREF="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</A>
Resolving localhost... 127.0.0.1
Connecting to localhost|127.0.0.1|:8080... connected.
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 500 Internal Server Error
2011-05-06 03:54:44 ERROR 500: Internal Server Error.

So... what now?

How can I see whats wrong?

Also, how should I be deploying this? :/

for reference, this is on a ubuntu server running 10.10, so it has the mvc2
stuff required to run the app...

Doug.
