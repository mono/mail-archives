[Assuming you're testing under Windows, as stated in
your bug report]

If MS.NET does not detect a UTF BOM, it will fall
back to the default locale's encoding. Mono for Windows
does not fall back. It will simply assume en_US -&gt; ANSI.

&lt;globalization culture=&quot;de_DE&quot; uiCulture=&quot;de_DE&quot; ... /&gt;
might fix it, but I didn't test it.

Right now you're mixing utf8 and iso-8859-1 files
(Default.aspx file is ISO, while test.htm is UTF8).
It only works correctly under MS.NET because your locale's
default encoding is matching the file encoding.
With other words: it works by accident.

If you want a consistent setup, then try not to mix
file encodings, use UTF8 or set &quot;fileEncoding&quot; and set
the &quot;culture&quot; attribute (to make Mono for Windows happy).

Also, don't touch the request- and resposeEncoding attributes
as they have nothing to do with the file encoding.
