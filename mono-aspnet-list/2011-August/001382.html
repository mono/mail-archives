It depends what you are looking for.

Remember that Mono is just .NET on other platforms. It does not matter if
you use Visual Studio, SharpDevelop, xacc, MonoDevelop, or Emacs to create
your code. It should build and run equally well on Windows, Mac, or Linux.
There is not much need for Mono specific web developer info.

MonoDevelop is patterned pretty closely after Visual Studio. If you are
comfortable with VS, I am sure you would pick-up MonoDevelop very quickly.
That said, although you can certainly click to &quot;add controller&quot; and the like
in your solution/project view, MonoDevelop does not have as many bells and
whistles for web dev as Visual Studio does.

MonoDevelop does not contain an ASP.NET visual forms builder or anything
like that. Also, the &quot;new project&quot; types are pretty bare bones and dated.
For example, the ASP.NET MVC project still assumes ASP.NET MVC 1.0.

That said, MonoDevelop will build your Visual Studio solution files
(including VS 2010) just fine. If you are the kind of person that writes
code rather than configures visual tooling, MonoDevelop should work well for
you.

I have created many ASP.NET and ASP.NET MVC (1, 2, and 3) apps using
MonoDevelop and it has always worked well for me. I tend not to rely too
much the visual and code generation capabilities of VS though so your
mileage may vary.
