<PRE>Hi Guys,

I've created a service in Visual Studio (C#) and it works perfectly within
the VS IDE.  I need to deploy this service to have it hosted on Ubuntu 14.04
using Nginx.  Nginx wants web content in /usr/share/nginx/html/ but I'm not
sure if a web service should be placed there.  Also, I'm clueless about web
services and don't know which files to deploy.

Questions:

  What files need to be copied to the hosting server and where are they
placed?

  What file permissions and ownership are required?

  Is there a specific directory structure needed on the hosting server?

I've been trying for 3 days to get this working.  I've found plenty of
articles on how to get a service working within an IDE but nothing about how
to deploy to anything other than IIS and what files are needed to make it
consumable by clients.  I've found several articles about how to configure
Apache, Nginx and XSD but no mention of which files are needed and where
they go.

If someone could please point me to articles that answer these questions I
would greatly appreciate it.  I haven't been able to find them.

Thanks very much and have a great day......
