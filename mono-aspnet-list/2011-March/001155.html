<PRE>I've got a set of web services that must have some form of authentication
passed from the mobile devices to these services to validate/identify them.
My original thought was to always pass the authentication key as the first
argument to every method.  This will work but to me seems like a major hack/
poor design.  Next thought was to bury the authentication key in the Soap
Header and decorate the methods with attributes that handle this.  Problem
here is it seems the &quot;Required&quot; flag in SoapHeaderAttribute is deprecated
and ignored.  Next thought was to try and move the services from ASP.Net to
WCF, but I can't seemed to even get mod_mono to process a simple
Service1.svc application.  Maybe I am just missing something in the
configuration, but I am worried WCF is not fully implemented yet.

So I need some advice,  if you were me today how would you accomplish this
in mono?  Thanks!
