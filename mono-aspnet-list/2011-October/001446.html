<PRE>I'm running fastcgi-mono-server4.exe on my hosted server, (I can't run xsp
directly and they don't have mod_mono installed) and pretty much everything
is working just great.

 

The only problem I'm seeing is when, after a short duration of inactivity,
my fastcgi process is stopped. when it's restarted by mod_fastcgi to handle
the next incoming request, the ASP.NET hosting code proceeds to re-compile
my whole website, which can take upwards of 15 seconds causing a significant
delay.

 

I have set MONO_ASPNET_NODELETE=1 and verified that all those assemblies are
being retained in my $TEMP directory. Is it necessary for ASP.NET to do all
that recompilation when it already has those cached assemblies lying around
from the previous compilation? Or would it be possible to just check the
timestamps and skip the compilation?

 

Thanks!

Piers.
