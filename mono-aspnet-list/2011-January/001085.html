<PRE>Greetings.

I'm having some issues getting a stable environment going.  The basic
gist of what I'm trying to do is to run Mono behind nginx.  Apache
doesn't scale well for my smallish VPS.

One of the problems that I'm having is posting to a web service.  I'm
trying to run BlogEngine.NET under it, and their latest version relies
more heavily on web services, especially in the administrative area.
nginx is giving a 405 error when an AJAX call posts to a URL formed
like &quot;/Users/Users.asmx/GetUsers&quot;.  Over on the nginx forums, the
cause for this is that nginx believes this to be a post to a static
file (albeit one that doesn't exist).  I posted a message over on the
nginx forums, as I couldn't get the posted workarounds to work, and as
of yet have not heard back from them.  Even expressly telling nginx to
send everything to the Mono FastCGI server doesn't work.

At one point, I had written a web service, but couldn't get it to
display anything but the &quot;overview&quot; page under nginx.  (The above was
probably the reason.)  Anyway, when I deployed that web service, I set
up nginx to proxy to xsp2 running on port 8082.  This worked well,
with the exception of all the URLs that tried to put themselves
together based on where they were running were exposing themselves as
&quot;services.djs-consulting.com:8082/Whatever.asmx/DoStuff&quot;.  (Kills the
auto-discovery stuff!)  I tried to run BlogEngine.NET the same way,
and it worked, but the login page tried to redirect me to that port.
When I took the port off, everything worked; the login had processed,
and I could do what I needed to do.  However, this port thing could
turn into a problem.

The top problem is pretty much moot; until nginx is modified to allow
posts like that, there's not much I can do.  Is there anything that I
can do about the second issue?  Is there some way, when proxying to
xsp2, to tell it the port on which it's actually seen vs. the one on
which it's listening?
