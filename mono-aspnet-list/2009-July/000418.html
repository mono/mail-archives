Hi all, 
I am a .NET developer till now on Windows os. 
I am very happy to discovered the mono project and I want to perform some
tests. The result is very good in general but from 2 days I have a lot of
problem with the events: &quot;handles clause requires declared with with events&quot;
in a simple radiobuttonlist (for example). I want to use the event
OnSelectedIndexChanged but I receive the error in the subject.
Following the suggestion of this forum I tried to declare the radiobutton 
(in my base class)

Protected WithEvents RadioButtonList1 As RadioButtonList

but the compiler says that it says it is declared two times withevents

or change the call of the event OnSelectedIndexChanged=&quot;...&quot;

For my poin of view  is a very nice world Mono but is really important to
use the events%-| to a good resault :-D

Main point is the difference between Windows os and ***ux os: in the first
environment we have no error about it, instead in my Suse distribution I
have that error.

Have you some idea or suggestion?

Thanks a lot!

Massimo
