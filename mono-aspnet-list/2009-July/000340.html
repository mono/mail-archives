<PRE>
My earlier post and subsequent research regarding virtual hosting has led me
to suspect that Mono may have a serious flaw. Perhaps I&#8217;m missing something
very basic, but judging by the absence of replies to my earlier post, maybe
not.

I&#8217;m convinced that ASP.net and Mono have a very bright future. ASP.net
removes many of the issues previously associated with writing complex web
applications. As long as Microsoft doesn&#8217;t screw it up it&#8217;s going to be very
popular.  Mono on the other hand opens this technology up to a much wider
audience. The two are a great combination.

Here&#8217;s the issue. In order for Mono to really grab the ASP.net market, it
needs to accommodate the ISP&#8217;s. If ISP&#8217;s can run their ASP.net web hosts on
a Linux server instead of the much more expensive Windows box, it will be
very beneficial. I&#8217;m not an experienced System Administrator, but I haven&#8217;t
been able to setup web hosting on Mono. Although setting up multiple web
sites is easy on Mono, setting up web hosts each with their own domain name
(ie www.example.com, www.example2.com etc), isn&#8217;t. With Apache, this is done
using VirtualHosts in the apache2.conf file and then setting the ServerName
to the web hosts domain name; however, when I tried this under Mono, Apache
won&#8217;t re-start. One poster suggested that this is an Apache problem rather
than a Mono issue, but VirtualHosts works fine in native Apache and it&#8217;s the
introduction of the Mono include statement (Include
/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/) that causing the problem so why would the
Apache people know how to fix it?

This is what I&#8217;ve tried (using many different variations of syntax):

Sites-available Settings
I followed the Mono documentation like this:
  In a file called example.com, I added
  Alias /example &quot;/var/www/example &quot;
  AddMonoApplications default &quot;/example:/var/www/example &quot;
  &lt;Location /example &gt;
	SetHandler mono
  &lt;/Location&gt;
I then run a2ensite exmple and then /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

Sites-available/default Settings
I tried adding this to the default file:
&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
	ServerName www.example.com
	ServerAdmin <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-aspnet-list">webmaster at localhost</A>
	DocumentRoot /var/www/example
	&lt;Directory /&gt;
		Options FollowSymLinks
		AllowOverride None
	&lt;/Directory&gt;
	&lt;Directory /var/www/example/&gt;
		Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
		AllowOverride None
		Order allow,deny
		allow from all
	&lt;/Directory&gt;
	ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error.log
	LogLevel warn
	CustomLog /var/log/apache2/access.log combined
    Alias /doc/ &quot;/usr/share/doc/&quot;
    &lt;Directory &quot;/usr/share/doc/&quot;&gt;
        Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride None
        Order deny,allow
        Deny from all
        Allow from 127.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 ::1/128
    &lt;/Directory&gt;

I don&#8217;t believe that something as well designed as Mono can be missing
something as basic as virtualHosting, so I&#8217;m probably doing something wrong.
I&#8217;ve spent days researching and experimenting this but have not found a
solution. My concern is that others will be turned away from such a good
technology because they too can&#8217;t find an answer. If someone can give me
some direction, perhaps it will not only help me but be a source of
information for others trying to find a solution to this issue.
