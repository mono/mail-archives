We are also experiencing these 503 errors after a random amount of time
(usually within 6 hours, and we only have a few calls every 60 seconds).
We're running Mono 2.4 on Unbutu.

mod_mono Control Panel reports:
0 requests currently being processed; limit: 20
Restarting Apache (reload, restart, stop/start) does not work.
