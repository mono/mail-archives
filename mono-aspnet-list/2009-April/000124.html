<PRE>
In a previous post i was trying to use the VBNC compiler and import the
mysql.data...
could not seem to make this work..

so now i am trying to precompile and put on server using mono 2.4

so now i precompile and put the .dll on the server and put the generated bin
folder on the server...also there is a PrecompiledApp.config file with the
following..&lt;precompiledApp version=&quot;2&quot; updatable=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;



when i try to look at a page i get the following...is there something
different that should be in my precompiledapp.config file


This is a marker file generated by the precompilation tool, and should not
be deleted!
