 &gt;&gt; I would suggest you consider using another database altogether. SQLite

 &gt; I would suggest you do some research before giving advice to other
 &gt; people. A simple Google search for the words &quot;Sqlite mono&quot; (who would
 &gt; have thought of those?) would have been enough.

Beyond that, FirebirdSQL has a very mature set of drivers for Mono, as well as 
feature rich support with NHibernate/Castle ActiveRecord/Fluent etc...

There's also PostgreSQL.

One bit of caution is that SQLite really won't scale well if there's a single 
database with many people connecting at once (for writes)... It'll go a little 
further than say Access/Jet but not nearly as much as a service based rdbms. 
It may be a decent database for certain implementations, and if you can 
segment the data into separate DBs it'll scale better under load.
