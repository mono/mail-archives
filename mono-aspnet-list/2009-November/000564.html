<PRE>
I'd like to post the solution to a bug that seriously had me scratching my
head. This may be answered already but I could not easily find the solution
to this on the web and had to resort to a painstaking process to discover
the issue.

If you see this error message:

System.FormatException: Input string was not in the correct format
  at System.Int32.Parse (System.String s, NumberStyles style,
IFormatProvider provider) [0x00000] 
  at System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebColorConverter.ConvertFrom
(ITypeDescriptorContext context, System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture,
System.Object value) [0x00000] 


The solution is to hunt for a asp control which has a property such as
ForeColor=&quot;Red&quot;, then removing this solves the problem. 

Example which gives the error:  
&lt;asp:Label ID=&quot;lblMessage&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot; Text=&quot;&quot; Visible=&quot;true&quot;
Font-Bold=&quot;true&quot; ForeColor=&quot;Red&quot; /&gt;

Example which works okay: 
&lt;asp:Label ID=&quot;lblMessage&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot; Text=&quot;&quot; Visible=&quot;true&quot;
Font-Bold=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;

Now I don't mind the fact that &quot;Red&quot; may not be supported as a colour,
however the part I find extremely painful is that the error message shown
does not tell me ANYTHING about where to hunt for the problem. 
We need to have a better error message for this so that developers don't
need to comment out lines of code one by one to see if the problem is
solved.

I'd much appreciate it if a kind soul could log this as a bug as I do not
have a login for Novell.
