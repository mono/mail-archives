<PRE>
I have an asp.net site that I am beginning to test in earnest using Mono on
openSUSE 11.1 and Apache. The site appears to work well however we have been
experiencing some problems in the last few days with the site becoming
unresponsive.

Based on the documentation I had added 'MonoAutoRestartMode Time' and
'MonoAutoRestartTime 00:06' to my configuration file as I thought perhaps
this would resolve our issues but it doesn't seem to. 

In the latest error the Apache log file is reporting that the maximum number
of concurrent requests has been reached (20 by default I understand) and
subsequent requests are dropped. What I don't understand is what is causing
the maximum requests to be reached as presently only a handful of users are
testing.

The log file indicates a number of errors predominantly '(32)Broken pipe:
write_data failed' and 'Invalid argument: Failed to acquire
/tmp/mod_mono_dashboard_BlueBox_2.lock lock' which I don't completely
understand. Can anyone help?

I have attached my configuration file and the latest Apache error log. 

Thanks. <A HREF="http://old.nabble.com/file/p26472293/bluebox.conf">http://old.nabble.com/file/p26472293/bluebox.conf</A> bluebox.conf
