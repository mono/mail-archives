The is no such list because it does not make any sense to have one.

The list would be huge because we're not supposed to respect
private members because they are simply unknown to us.
We DO NOT DECOMPILE code.

The only exception are the fields of [Serializable] classes
which we can obtain from the serialization stream.

If you feel like having to peek at private members, add
a big FIXME comment to *your* source code and don't forget
to test is thoroughly on all MS.NET and Mono versions
because such members could be changed w/out notice in future
versions.
