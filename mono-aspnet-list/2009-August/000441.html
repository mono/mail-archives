Hi,

My client requires SSL based LDAP authentication on the ASP.NET (2.0)
application we have written, which is going to run on Windows 2003 Server
through IIS6.  For the moment I am using a simple console application to
test my code - a lot easier and simpler that uploading the rather large web
application dlls each time.

&gt;<i>From everything I've read, it appears that Mono is the best solution to
</I>this, but I'm having a great deal of difficulty getting it to work.

I have added the novell.directory.ldap.dll and mono.security.dll references
to the console app, and included the dlls in &quot;installation&quot; directory on the
server.
I have installed Mono (2.4.2.3) but not included the GTK part, as I don't
believe it's necessary.
I have added the security certificate from the clients LDAP system into the
Trust store using certmgr.

But when I attempt a secure bind to the LDAP server, I receive a 91 Connect
Error, with the IOException of &quot;The authentication or decryption has failed&quot;
and TlsException of &quot;Invalid certificate received from server&quot;.

What have I missed?
Am I trying to achieve the impossible... or have I missed a simple step out? 
(Do I need to set an application setting or environment variable that I'm
not aware of?)

Many thanks for any help,
Cheers,
Tom
