<PRE>Hi all,

I have a web service running on a CentOS 5.2 server, with Apache
2.2.3, Mono 2.4.3 and xsp 2.4.2. This web service has a single method
that takes multiple &quot;complex&quot; objects as parameters (DateTimes etc.)
This service has been successfully running on said machine for around
6 months, with a client app POSTing data to it via HTTP.

A more powerful machine was purchased to run the web service; it has
CentOS 5.4 with Apache 2.2.7 but is otherwise completely identical to
the older box, down to the directory structures, configuration files
and options therein, etc. We copied the web service from the old
machine to the new, preserving all directories, with the expectation
that it would work exactly the same. However, on this PC, the web
service only accepts SOAP requests (attempting to POST to it raises an
exception that the method doesn't exist).

I have checked an cross-checked on both computers and the only
difference I can see is in the Web Service Test Form. On the old PC,
it specifies the &quot;supported operations&quot; as &quot;SOAP, HttpGet, HttpPost&quot;
while the new machine only allows &quot;SOAP&quot;. Additionally, if I check the
WSDL generated by the web service test form, on the old machine it
correctly generates the operations for GET and POST, while the new one
does not.

I am completely stumped here... have tried adding HttpGet and HttpPost
in the web.config file but that had no effect. If anyone could advise
anything - even something as &quot;small&quot; as exactly where I should start
looking for the cause of these differences - I'd be extremely
grateful.
</PRE>
