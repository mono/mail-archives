<PRE>

I have noticed that some pages are more likely to cause this problem than
others (although getting exact feedback from users is difficult).  The pages
in question have a cache instruction at the top:

&lt;%@ OutputCache Duration=&quot;1&quot; VaryByParam=&quot;*&quot; %&gt;

This is something I put in place a long time ago to ensure that pages were
*not* cached locally on a user's machine, as some users were commenting that
some pages were out of date and in the end clearing their local cache sorted
it.  However I have done more reading on the OutputCache and realise that it
is perhaps not a good idea to use it in this way.  Could it be what is
causing the problems?

I thought that the cache was a cache for a single user only, but perhaps it
caches the output for all users?  My thinking is that one user accesses a
page, it is cached for a second, and during a busy period if another user
accesses the same address within the 1 second they would see the first users
page output rather than their own (created from scratch)?   

Probably just clutching at straws...
