<PRE>I am trying desperately to get a nuget gallery hosted on Apache with mono. I
have mono and apache configured and a new empty .net 4 web app with
nuget.server created and copied to the linux server. I got as far as getting
the site up and running so the Default.aspx is displayed when browsing to
the site. However I can't get anything beyond that to work. If I try to view
available packages via the link on the main page (I copied some nupkg files
into the Packages directory), I get the following error:

Description: HTTP 404.The resource you are looking for (or one of its
dependencies) could have been removed, had its name changed, or is
temporarily unavailable. Please review the following URL and make sure that
it is spelled correctly.

Details: Requested URL: /nuget/Packages

On IIS, the routemagic.dll seems to be the key in making the /nuget path
work. However that simply isn't happening in Mono. I have no idea if this is
simply not a supported service on mono or if I'm doing something wrong.

All permissions are correct. I am calling mod-mono-server4 since the
nuget.server was built with .NET 4.

Any help or direction would be most helpful.
