<PRE>This has got me a bit stumped.  I have an ASP MVC 3 app that's current
running in production on Ubuntu 11.10 x86_64 server using Mono 2.10.5 from
the Ubuntu repositories.  In production, the first time the app is hit, it
goes through and compiles it; you can watch it with &quot;ps -ef&quot;, and
subsequent hits use that compiled version.  This is the expected behavior,
so hooray for that.

I'm working on the next version of the application, and in the interim,
have changed development machines.  I'm developing it on Windows 7, and
I've created a VirtualBox server mirroring the specs described above.  I'm
testing the application there in advance of putting it live, and I noticed
that every hit took longer than it should.  One page won't even pull up,
saying that the view cannot be found; I think this may be the compilation
timing out.  The more complex a page is, the longer it seems to take.
 Repeated hits to a page do seem a bit faster, but there's still a
compilation process being kicked off.  I suspected a permissions issue, but
I checked /tmp/www-data-temp-aspnet-0 directory (the output directory
specified in the &quot;ps&quot;), and there are several directories underneath that,
all with the compiled app, so that's not it.

The app has changed a bit.  The new release adds
globalization/localization, with Resources.resx and Resources.es.resx
providing the labels and images (a few).  Of course, there are upgraded
libraries and that sort of thing, but the globalization is the new thing.
 The /bin directory has the DLLs for the web app, the business logic layer,
supporting DLLs (no new ones), and a bin deployment of ASP MVC 3; and the
/bin/es directory has AppName.resources.dll (this part is new).

Do any of you fine folks have an idea what may be causing this?  I'm
hesitant to push this out with it behaving like this, in case it's not just
a configuration parameter I have wrong on the server.  (The virtual
host/mod_mono config is the same between servers, except for the server
name.)  I'd appreciate any help anyone could provide.
