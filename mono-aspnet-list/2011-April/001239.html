Many people seem to have problems using the TreeView control on Mono's ASP.NET. This can be read in different forums across the internet. However, most users are unable to provide a working sample, which demonstrates the real problem.

One of my web applications has never been working in Mono because of a bug in the TreeView control. Unfortunately, the application displays data from a private database which cannot be provided in form of a test case. It was a real pain to debug everything and isolate the real problem in form of a test project.

Meanwhile, I was successful in this area and created a bug report (s. <A HREF="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=685267">https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=685267</A>). The provided test case shows a very simple TreeView. When clicking the root item for the first time, the child items are NOT expanded. Additionally, the Page.IsPostBack property is false instead of true. This may lead to further problems when used in a real world application.

I have already started to debug System.Web.dll but haven't  found a solution yet. It seems that the PostBack operation does not work as expected. It is definitely not easy to debug this kind of problem. Maybe someone else could take a look into it.
