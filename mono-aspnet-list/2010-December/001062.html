I now notice that these exceptions are now logged in apache's error log.
cool. My most recent problem was i accidentally left in a reference i didnt
need while building the DLL and mono tried to load it. It was in the bin
folder BUT it isnt mono compatible. When looking in apache's error log it
claimed it couldnt load Lucence.Net (it can). I switched to 2.6.7 restarted
the server and it correctly informed me of the real DLL giving me problems.
Actually in this case it reference a dll i didnt have

** (/usr/local/lib/mono/2.0/gmcs.exe:22308): WARNING **: The following
assembly referenced from name.dll could not be loaded:
