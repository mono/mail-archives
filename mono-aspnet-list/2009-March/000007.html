Hi,
i'm hosting about 10 websites on a fc10 64bit using apache and mono.
With mono 1.9 everything worked fine , but now that i upgraded to 2.2 i've a
lot of problems.

The most important of all is that often websites are down showing the
message: 
&quot;The server is temporarily unable to service your request due to maintenance
downtime or capacity problems. Please try again later. &quot;

and in my httpd log:
&quot;Failed to connect to mod-mono-server after several attempts to spawn the
process&quot;

I tryed to configure http.conf for autorestart mono processes after several
request served or time elapsed but the problem still persist.

I think it could be a problem with files located in /var/run/mod_mono or in
/tmp because if i restart apache , mod_mono process are still executing . I
have to kill them manually and clean /var/run/mod_mono and /tmp before
restart apache again.

I tryed wirh apachectl too but the problem still remain the same, mod_mono
process doesn't restart.

After restarted all (apache , mod_mono and cleaned dirs) all websites works
fine for some hour but random, one of them shows the message &quot;The server is
temp....&quot;

Any idea?

Thx
