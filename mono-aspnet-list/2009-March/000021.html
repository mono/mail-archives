<PRE>Hello Everyone,

I want to know, whether we have already or in future have plans of
implementing windows azure services( cloud based platform) as part of Mono.
I developed an application with Azure( based on .net 3.5 sp1). It ran
without any issues with MOMA. But when I tried it with Mono develop, it says
the application is not supported. So I assume we have not developed the
apis.
So I thought, it would help the mono and suse community immensely if I try
implementing the APIs with regard to the azure services.

The azure runtime environment seems similar to ASP.net( with the xml config
files and couple of additional file like .cfdef,.cscfg).
It would be very helpful, if you could let me know whether this is a viable
project to start working on and please let me know where I can start
Probably some pointers from you,people who have actually implemented
asp.netfor Mono would help me immensely - regd the development runtime
and the apis

Thanks for helping me out.
-Keerthi
