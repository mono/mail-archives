</I>Sorry i can't help you. My experience with ASP hosting with mono is very
very frustrating.
I try to setup production asp hosting few years ago with mono1 and xsp.
After few weeks of tests i find it completely unreliable. Now i try another
time hoping mod_mono now is mature and stable. Imho it's still completely
unreliable for production. Probably when developers decide to leave xsp
approach and make something like asp_worker process for apache mono asp
hosting grow up beyond the stage of a nice toy.
If you are using single CPU machine i suggest you to take a look on
Grasshoper (<A HREF="http://dev.mainsoft.com/">http://dev.mainsoft.com/</A>).
But beware they want $$$KK if you are running more than one CPU.
For me asp hosting on linux is closed for another 2-3 years.
I hate java, but there is large numbers of free application servers so for
serious business applications i switch to J2EE.
