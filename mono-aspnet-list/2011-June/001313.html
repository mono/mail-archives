</I>&gt;<i> &quot;If you encounter any problems, please either file a bug report (for the

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>The instructions pointed to three support paths, the first one being the
Mono ASP.NET team and the second one being the referenced thread. The third
path came across as a &quot;last resort&quot;.  Regardless, I posted this to this
mailing list only as a suggestion/vote regarding Mono's ASP.NET improvement
path generally, e.g. that specific projects like Orchard should drive it,
because projects like Orchard can give Mono new opportunities to really
shine. Regarding specific support Orchard questions/issues I already know to
defer questions to the Orchard project team and/or to fork the code myself.

In other words, I understand your point, and you are absolutely right, but
that in itself doesn't make my suggestion wrong. I can take 'no' for an
answer. :) I kind of expected it; I imagine everyone is swamped.


&gt;<i> I agree that using Mono, especially mod_mono, is a PITA compared to Linux.
</I>&gt;<i> I am eagerly awaiting the announcement of your new initiative to see it
</I>&gt;<i> improve.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>It might actually happen (no joke) but I'm not yet in a position to announce
it. Being as I come from Windows and am trying to use Mono to leverage the
other platforms, I am still green on some of the best practices and
conventions therein, but I'm sure that Mono has an adequate QA'ing /
code-checking process to alleviate some of that.
