<PRE>It seems the first announcement made about Orchard running on Mono was the
last announcement, and this happened right just before the recent human
resources debacle. Now that some of the dust has started to settle (I
hope?), I thought I should post this.

IMO Orchard Project and Mono need to renew their relationship romance. The
documentation on Orchard running on Mono appears to be based on a patched
v1.0 and we're nearly at v1.2 now; needless to say, the current version of
Orchard (v1.1) doesn't work on Mono.

Further, support for running Orchard on Mono should target primarily OSX,
not Linux. Orchard seems to be targeting the WordPress community, but the WP
community seems to be largely a MacBook-toting community. In order for
Orchard to be adopted drastically by the &quot;standard web community&quot; as WP
already enjoys, IMO the site tooling should be the same as the design
tooling, and Mac seems to be the designers' choice OS.

IMO the automated building, deployment, and configuration of XSP on Mac's
Apache with the Mono installer should be reprioritized. Web designers in
general seem to opt for Mac, which for the last couple years has been touted
as &quot;the most ideal developer platform&quot; by developers of varying disciplines
and tools.

Thanks,
Jon Davis
