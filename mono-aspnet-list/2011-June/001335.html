<PRE>A bit hard to reply precisely due to the lack of details, but I'll try
anyway.

I may be wrong, but maybe you could do what you want regardless of the
language used by the game. The fact it's C# may not change anything in the
end, if it acts like a black box that you have to feed scripts. Unless it's
a .NET assembly that exposes public methods.

You say &quot;most of you&quot; don't know C#, meaning some do? In that case, that
sounds doable. If you don't know C#, though, you'll have to learn, and
making this program will naturally be harder than just directly writing C#
scripts for that sim game. So you may want to learn how these scripts work
first.
