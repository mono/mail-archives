The doc that Jan links to is excellent.

One small thing though is that you do not have to install MySql.Data.dll to
the GAC for a web app.  You can also just put it in the 'bin' directory.  I
prefer this myself as it means I can deploy to a virgin server without
having to prep the GAC and everything just works.  It also means, that I am
always using the same version of the connector in dev, testing, and
production.  I put MySql.Data.dll in my source code repository and it just
migrates through with everything else.

Also, just a reminder that Entity Framework is not supported under Mono.  It
sounds like SubSonic works well though and NHibernate works too.  Nothing
wrong with good old ADO.NET though if you have the time.
