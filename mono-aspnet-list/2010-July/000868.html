Hi,

Yes, I am using this on openSuse 11.0 and Mono 2.6.1.

The 0000-00-00 date issue is between .NET and MySQL (I use 5.0).

I run a WEB SITE for a property rental company (the intranet system for
managing bookings). The internet portion of it is small, but being expanded.

I also have a few smaller sites.

Many many days ago there were issues with CommandBuilders, but most are
resolved now. I still have unresolved issues with complex DataSet.Select()
filters (but I worked around them).

The performance is generally on par with the alternatives.

So, given that it's free and open source, I'd go for it.

Regards

Jan
