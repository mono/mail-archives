Hi,

I wrestled my own way trough, but a Google search for &quot;getting started mysql
connect net&quot; found this
<A HREF="http://downloads.mysql.com/docs/connector-net-en.a4.pdf,">http://downloads.mysql.com/docs/connector-net-en.a4.pdf,</A> which, if you sit
down and just read through all of it, will at least give a very solid
foundation of what you need to be aware of - as with all DBs, there is quite
a bit to beware of (see for example, 5.10 - 5.13).

As most hosting environments don't allow you to install DLLs in the global
cache, I got used to copying the MySQL DLL in the application's BIN
directory, where it SHOULD always be automatically accessible.

I may not be able to help with an issue specific to your site, but you're
welcome to ask, nonetheless.

Best regards

Jan
