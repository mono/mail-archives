Yes, I am doing it.

ASP.NET is fairly mature on Mono.  I have not run into any problems with the
built-in controls.  There are even some third-party ASP.NET controls
supporting Mono officially now.  There have been a few parser bugs over time
but nothing recently.  I stay pretty up to date on the 2.6+ versions.

The MySQL connector works well on Mono at least using plain old ADO.NET
(IDataReader and friends).  Linq-to-SQL is available for MySQL but is much
less mature.  Linq-to-Entities is not available.  NHibernate has been around
for some time though if you are looking for an ORM.

I have had an issue with '0000-00-00' in database Date fields causing
exceptions that required fiddling with the connection string.  I am not sure
that is Mono specific though as I think it is really the MySQL connector. 
In .NET, the minimum date allowed is year one, month one, day one so
'0000-00-00' is not valid.

You can certainly use Visual Studio to write the code.  I do most of my
ASP.NET development in MonoDevelop these days but that does not impact
anything.  I usually build the assemblies with xbuild (msbuild) right on my
server so the IDE I use to the code in is not really that important.
