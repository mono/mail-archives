Ok,

a last thanks to you Robert.

I found a solution to work it out. It's been like you said, the lack of
memory has been my problem. 'Cause of that I noticed, for every VH I add the
memory raises for about 50MB. I configured the VH that's been related to the
Site with the IP as the Apache's default site. On top to to that I removed
every module from Apache I didn't need + changed the config of the mysql
server. I guess, I won't not be able to run a third website, but at least
it's workin' now. Maybe there's some more possibilities how Apache handles
vhost, so they don't need that big amount of memory.

Anywaybe this can be useful for anyone else.

Best regards

Florian
