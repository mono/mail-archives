<PRE>This is a shot in the dark, but I had some problems like this lastnight when
configuring DbProviders for SQLite on linux/mono.  The problem ended up
being the assembly filename's casing. I know you're not using SQLite, but
this follows the same rules for all types of references.

I had System.Data.SQLite.DLL  and not System.Data.SQLite.dll.    Switching
the filename to use a lowercase extension worked.

I also noticed in your message you entered BLL in an assembly reference. I'm
guessing it's a typo. Assembly references typically use the Assembly Name,
which excludes the extension. Here, for example, is my reference related to
the db providers I mentioned earlier.

&lt;...  type=&quot;System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteFactory, System.Data.SQLite&quot;/&gt;

For many situations, you can leave out the version and signature and just
follow the pattern &quot;{fully qualified class name}, {assembly name}&quot; as long
as that assembly is accessible to your executable; (either in the GAC, the
PATH or in the same folder), it should be able to find it.

There may also be odd situations where CPU architecture of the assembly will
cause it not to be found. If a .NET assembly is hard-wired to CPU
architecture, then you need to make sure your executable matches that
architecture.  SQLite again is a good example.  If you're running default
.NET compilation on x64 platform, then it will run with native x64 runtime.
If you reference the 32bit SQLite assembly it will give you an error that it
cannot be found. You have to manually reference the x64 SQLite assembly.
Normally this isn't an issue when .NET assemblies are compiled to use ANY
architecture.

Good Luck!
