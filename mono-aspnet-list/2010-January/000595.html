Hi, 
I got a serious problem getting Apache to work together with Oracle on my
SLES 10 machine. I want to host a Mono application in Apache using Mod_Mono
which is no problem as long as I do not use an Oracle database. On my SLES
an Oracle 10g client is running and working as I could prove by checking
over TNSPING. I installed the client following this link from Novell:
<A HREF="http://ftp.novell.com/partners/oracle/docs/10gR2_sles10_install.pdf">http://ftp.novell.com/partners/oracle/docs/10gR2_sles10_install.pdf</A>
<A HREF="http://ftp.novell.com/partners/oracle/docs/10gR2_sles10_install.pdf">http://ftp.novell.com/partners/oracle/docs/10gR2_sles10_install.pdf</A> 
Moreover I defined the ORACLE_HOME, LD_LIBRARY_PATH and TNS_ADMIN variables
as far as they were not defined by the installer. I checked if it was
working but it was not. I defined those variables again in the Apache start
script and later in the Mod_Mono-Server start script via export. I checked
if they were present with a little ASP.NET website I created and saw that
they should be working. Nevertheless the error always was the same the:
libclntsh.so could not be found. So I checked the Mono linking to this file
(OCI.dll-&gt;libclntsh.so) which was fine, I tried to add LD_LIBRARY_PATH over
ldconfig by adding the path to /etc/ld.so.conf which did not work.
By the way running the mono server by hand (with xsp2 but in Apache's wwwrun
user) I got access to the database.
And now I am quite desperate and don't know what to do else. Is there anyone
who had a similar problem?

Thanks for any answer.

Ferdinand
