Hi,
JuanchoMan, I have a hosting server with multiple virtual hosts, and I found
out that when I copied my website to another virtual host &quot;USING THE SAME
CONFIGURATION!&quot; Guess what.. it worked... I already post the same question
as you, and nobody answered us... 

Maybe you can tell me something, when you deployed for the first time it
didn't took a long time and displayed and error related for being unable to
compiling lock an assembly or something like that?

That happened to me first...

Also I figured out that if you put the app_code on the of public_html with
the code inside... it will work...

This is silly I don't want it to work like that I want to have my website
inside another directory... like public_html/test

If someone has something to say about this, please share with us
