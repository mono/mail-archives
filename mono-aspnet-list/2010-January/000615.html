<PRE>Hi jmalcolm,

&gt;<i> I do not believe that MonoDevelop supports the Web Site
</I>&gt;<i> metaphor for ASP.NET.
</I>That's too bad. I was hoping to overcome a limitation [bug?] in Visual
Studio 2008 on x64Vista - IntPtr is the wrong size because the web
server hauled around by Visual Studio is x86. It is causing my calls
into the native APIs to fail.

&gt;<i> When you say the DLL &quot;won't run&quot; I am not sure what you
</I>&gt;<i> mean though.
</I>Agreed - a very bad description. Here's what I'm doing and seeing.

(1) Create a Web Application (taking defaults)
    - Default.aspx
    - Default.vb
(2) Press &lt;F5&gt; to build and run

Upon attempting to run, I receive the error, &quot;could not connect to webserver&quot;.

(3) Project Options -&gt; Run -&gt; General
    - Check 'Run on external console'

No error. Console output is:

Adding applications '/:.'...
Registering application:
    Host:          any
    Port:          any
    Virtual path:  /
    Physical path: /home/jeffrey/Projects/Mono-Web-Test/Mono-Web-Test/
xsp2
Listening on address: 127.0.0.1
Root directory: /home/jeffrey/Projects/Mono-Web-Test/Mono-Web-Test
Listening on port: 8080 (non-secure)

Unfortunately, no web server is listening:

$ netstat -a | grep 8080
$

Indeed, I timeout when attempting to connect to <A HREF="http://127.0.0.1:8080">http://127.0.0.1:8080</A>
using Firefox.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When you say the DLL &quot;won't run&quot; I am not sure what you mean though. &#160;The
</I>&gt;<i> DLL is the compiled code that will be called by your pages but you do not
</I>&gt;<i> execute the DLL directly. &#160;You should be trying to view your pages (for
</I>&gt;<i> example you may have a files with names like index.aspx or Default.aspx) in
</I>&gt;<i> a web browser. &#160;These .aspx files will have @Page directive at the top that
</I>&gt;<i> include a statement like Inherits that specifies what classes and methods
</I>&gt;<i> from the DLL are available to that page.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You interact with the pages, and the pages call upon the DLL. &#160;You need a
</I>&gt;<i> web server to serve the pages to your web browser. &#160;On Linux, the Mono test
</I>&gt;<i> web server is called XSP (or XSP2). &#160;There is also a module (mod_mono) that
</I>&gt;<i> allows the Apache web server to serve ASP.NET pages that will use Mono on
</I>&gt;<i> the server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My apologies if I completely misunderstood your comment that the DLL &quot;won't
</I>&gt;<i> run&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you really, really want a Web Site structure there are some
</I>&gt;<i> possibilities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you already have a Web Site structure, Mono should run it just fine using
</I>&gt;<i> either XSP or mod_mono on Apache as the web server. &#160;The question is just
</I>&gt;<i> how to author one and I am assuming that you do not want to create it all in
</I>&gt;<i> gedit, vi, or emacs (although you could).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At one point, in what seems like the distant past, I used Visual Web
</I>&gt;<i> Developer, the free ASP.NET IDE from Microsoft, to connect remotely to files
</I>&gt;<i> on a Linux box that was running Mono and Apache/mod_mono.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I told Visual Web Developer (on Windows) to connect to the web site files
</I>&gt;<i> via FTP and just used an open web browser to connect to the linux web server
</I>&gt;<i> and test the files. &#160;I did not use the built-in test web server provided by
</I>&gt;<i> Visual Web Developer. &#160;This solution requires two boxes of course: one
</I>&gt;<i> Windows and one Linux but I remember thinking it was great at the time. &#160;Any
</I>&gt;<i> of the changes I made in Visual Web Developer would be immediately reflected
</I>&gt;<i> on the Linux server each time I saved the files and I could see the results
</I>&gt;<i> right away in my browser. &#160;The Web Site itself was running on Mono.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These days, you could use something like VirtualBox to run a copy of Windows
</I>&gt;<i> in a virtual machine to run Visual Web Developer and connect back to the
</I>&gt;<i> host Linux machine running Mono and the web server. &#160;You would still need a
</I>&gt;<i> Windows license but at least you would only need one box and Linux could be
</I>&gt;<i> the OS running native on your hardware.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Instead of a remote project, you could also just run Mono/XSP on Windows by
</I>&gt;<i> running XSP on top of the local web site directory. &#160;Just use a browser to
</I>&gt;<i> connect to XSP instead of the web server Microsoft builds into Visual Web
</I>&gt;<i> Develop and your app will be running on Mono. &#160;This means using Windows
</I>&gt;<i> exclusively though and you said you are running Ubuntu.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One thing that some people confuse is the difference between using
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop and running &quot;on Mono&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you are using XSP or Apache/mod_mono as your web server for development
</I>&gt;<i> then your application is running on Mono regardless of what you use to
</I>&gt;<i> author the web site. &#160;You do not need to run MonoDevelop to create a Mono
</I>&gt;<i> app.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On Windows, you actually do not even have to have Mono installed to run
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop. &#160;The stock Windows binaries available at monodevelop.com are
</I>&gt;<i> built to run on MS.NET and not on Mono at all. &#160;By default, the apps you
</I>&gt;<i> build will also run on .NET although you can install Mono and tell
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop to use Mono instead of MS.NET for apps you write.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One last thing, I do not believe that the VB compiler for Mono is of the
</I>&gt;<i> same quality as the one for C#. &#160;If you are not set on the language, you
</I>&gt;<i> might consider using C# under Mono or compiling your code on .NET and just
</I>&gt;<i> bringing the assemblies over to Mono. &#160;I am sure the VB support is getting
</I>&gt;<i> better and better though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [SNIP]
