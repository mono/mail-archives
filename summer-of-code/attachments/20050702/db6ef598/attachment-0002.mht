Hey,

It seems I can't send messages to summer-of-code@lists.ximian.com .
Anyways, here is my smummary.=20

Temat: Diva - first week summary
Data: Fri, 01 Jul 2005 20:13:48 +0200

Hi,=20

Here goes the summary for this week (The Diva Project).=20

1) I created the novell forge repository for the project:=20

        http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/project/?diva

In the SVN you will find the following modules:=20

	* Gdv - this is the libGdv.so stuff I'm writing I C - the engine
library wrapping the GStreamer that will be used in Diva. The gdv-sharp
bindings will be placed here as well. Gdv is based on G-Object, like
GStreamer. This will make porting (&quot;sharping&quot;) easier.=20

	* GStreamer - this module will contain new plugins that one day will
eventually land in the GStreamer CVS. That includes all the elements
that are not yet in GStreamer but I need them in Diva.=20

	* Diva - the application itself, C#.=20

For now, only Gdv module is there. During this week I managed to
implement a basic timeline support. Right now one can create (for
example) the following &quot;movie&quot; layout:


TRACK 1: 1111111111111|2222222222|33333333333333333
TRACK 2:      444444444444444444444444444
TRACK 3:                  5555555555555555555555555


					LEGEND:
                                        1,2,3 - Clips captured from
                                        camcorder (AVI - Video &amp; Audio)

					4,5   - Music (Mp3 - Audio)

When played this timeline yields 3 videos played one after another with
some background music. There is already sound mixing and stuff. Quite
nice. A screenshot can be found here: http://diva.enove.pl/?p=3D4

Unfortunately, my design of the timeline is very seek-inefficient (in
other words - moving the cursor along the timeline [the basic
video-editing operation] is very slow and not accurate). Actually, I
need to take two steps back and go for another design.=20


2) In the upcoming week I want to work solely on the libGdv and finish
it (in it's basic form). That means - timeline support with a decent
seek support, &quot;project&quot; support, and the basic filter support. If I
managed to do it by Friday, I'm won ;)=20


3) The problems I'm having now (with the timeline implementation) are
related to data flow and time. Audio in GStreamer travels in buffers.
Sometimes the buffers are big (7kb), sometimes very small (512 bytes).
That depends on the type of source file of the sound clip. Now, 7kb of
sound samples is 1/25th of a second (Audio CD quality). And sometimes a
&quot;cut&quot; happens in the middle of the buffer. That means cutting &amp; storing
the buffers. And you can't really use a simple fifo here, cause the
buffers might by not continous. It's getting complicated when you add
video to that...=20

A more general specification of this problem is - should the timeline be
&quot;atomic&quot; or not. Currently my implementation is rather &quot;analog&quot;. That
means, that each time a timeline is played it actually CAN give slightly
different results. This is beacuse it's based on a grain (seed) of
1/100th of a second. That's okay with video (which has a resolution of
1/25th of a sec. or 1/30th of a sec. - PAL or NTSC) but fails with audio
(which has a much higher grain).

I've actually seen professional video editing software (ie. Adobe
Premiere) that's based on the frames-per-second grain of the video. That
means, (ie) that audio clips can be placed on the timeline with a 1/25th
of a second resolution. That really sucks (it's impossible to
synchronize certain short-time effects)=20

Whatever, I suppose this sounds very abstract to everybody ;) It'll get
better when I start doing the actual diva interface ;)=20

A one non-abstract problem I'm having right now is - I'd like to
showcase you something, but all the stuff that's in the SVN is based on
the (huge) media files I'm having on my disk (outside of SVN). I'm
looking for an ftp space with at least 50MB of storage space to upload
them there. All the time I'm working with full-resolution PAL video
captured from my camera, so the files are big.=20
