What do you mean? To install the compact framework libraries in Linux,
and direct the compiler to use them?

If so, two problems arise:
-- MS licenses forbid to install their libraries in anything but Windows.
-- Our compilers doesn't recognize/process the special options needed anyway.

Another possibility is to use mono with a profile that mimics the
compact framework libraries

Well we don't have such a beast, because
-- dotNET CF is so crippled that it should not be called dotNET (they
are correcting some bits like better XML and COM-Interop for the next
version), we would have to cut too many things to be as crippled as
them, and no one invested time on that.
-- but dotNET CF also implements very different ui controls in its
winforms implementation, it's not duplicated in mono either.

AFAIK, it is not, in the way you are asking...

&gt;<i> If it is not possible, is it possible to use mono in any other way to
</I>&gt;<i> develop on winCE/Pocket PC?
</I>
Well, there are reports of people installing some mono libraries or
excerpts from our library codebase as part of their .NET CF apps,
particularly our XML handling code...

&gt;<i> Any help would be greatly appreciated.
