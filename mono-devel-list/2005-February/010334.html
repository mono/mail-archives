<PRE>Hi,

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Class1.cs catches all the exceptions and prints the text of them into 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the results file, if I understand correct your question.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then, it should have been reported as differences, but I could not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> find that specific test case.
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I fished this example from the diff. How did you search this 
</I>&gt;<i> specific test case?
</I>
I don't know the exact command line but my text editor uses GNU diff
(anyways if any kind of diff will list if there is such differences
in results, as well as others ). But anyways,

&gt;<i> If you download this zip: 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/9584/XSLT-testsuite-03.ZIP">http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/9584/XSLT-testsuite-03.ZIP</A> 
</I>
Oh. so I had older committee draft version that was the newest
at the time I created standalone test runner, while you have newer
draft version. Ok, I will update the target test collection which
might be incorrect (that doesn't matter; we can report such test
bugs if any).

&gt;&gt;<i> BTW it would be very nice if you split the patches per individual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem you fixed. Also, &quot;svn diff&quot; format would be better.
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, I used diff -Naur to produce a patch. What's the way to make a 
</I>&gt;<i> patch in &quot;svn diff&quot; format?
</I>
Just try &quot;svn diff&quot; in your locally-changed repositry.

&gt;<i> Hm, MonoDevelop then has to solve this problem somehow. What will happen 
</I>&gt;<i> if a user defines her own enum where few members have an equal value? 
</I>&gt;<i> Then you must go further and forbid such enum members in the language 
</I>&gt;<i> like you forbid duplicated cases in switch statement.
</I>
Is there such an enumeration type which is not buggy?
