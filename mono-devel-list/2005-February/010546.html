Yeah, I am not sure how many people need to set a breakpoint on public
int foo = 0. :-).

For now, the thing of setting /optimize to true by default works.
However, if we were to add more expensive optimizations (for example,
csc will do a round of jump optimizations), it would be nice to keep the
`duh' type ones on by default.

(nb, I realize that jump optimizations are done by the jit, etc. But
there might be other more expensive optimizations that are not done by
the jit, or optimizations that are so expensive that they would only be
done at aot time, so that it would be cool to do them at compile time as
well.)
