<PRE>It's ok, I've figured out how to do it and it is now working fine.
However, the timeout property for the HttpWebRequest object doesn't seem
affect the timeout period.  I'm setting it to timeout after 500 (ms) but
it's taking about 4-5mins until it actually does.  Any ideas?
 
Thanks a lot
 
Andrew

Subject: HttpWebRequest over SSL


Hi all,
    We're experimenting with mono for a small app that uses a GET to
pull down page contents.  I have tested the code over http, and https
using .NET and it works fine.  However, when using mono the http test
works fine but the https fails.  I'm getting the following exception
thrown and trace:
 

Unhandled Exception: System.Net.WebException: Error getting response
stream (Write): SendFailure ---&gt; System.IO.IOException: The
authentication or decryption has failed.
in &lt;0x001ec&gt;

Anyone got any pointers to get this functioning, or is it a work in
progress?
 
Thanks
