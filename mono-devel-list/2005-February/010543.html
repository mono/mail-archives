<PRE>Hi,

Just a quick heads up to say the new and improved version of my svn
source grabber and builder script has now been uploaded.

This version is substantially better than the version I uploaded
yesterday and if you sing to it nicely, it may even make you a coffee
while it's building the source.

As always, it comes with no warranty or the such. It does work though.
If you have yourself set to be able to use sudo make install, edit the
script to replace the su -c &quot;make install&quot; lines with sudo &quot;make
install&quot; and sudo &quot;/sbin/ldconfig&quot;

Other fun things included is a bomb script for aborts and will check to
see if there is a Makefile in the base of the source tree and if there
isn't, it runs autogen.sh with prefix set to either /usr/local or if
you'd rather /usr (you're asked)

As always, faults and improvements are welcome.

TTFN

Paul
