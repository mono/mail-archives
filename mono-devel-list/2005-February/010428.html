<PRE>Both. We need it and we would be very much happy to help with it.

Could you shed some light on how much time it would take? I'm reasonably
familiar with the ARM/XScale instruction set and have access to the ARM
Procedure Calling Standard. I ported eCOS on to our custom XScale board
successfully (which I designed). I also have access to a couple of
XScale reference boards in addition to our own.


Is there an existing port to clone off of?  Malte's paper (in 2002)
referred to the fact that the PowerPC would have been a better reference
to start with (both being RISC instruction sets)

Do you think it could be done successfully in a couple of months?

Thanks

Krishna

I'm working on the JIT port in my spare time, so very, very slowly.
Absolutely nothing is ready for now :-(

Do you ask just because you need it, or because you could help?

Ciao,
