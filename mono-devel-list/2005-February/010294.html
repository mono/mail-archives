There was an msft blog that basically said they figured out some corner
cases where you could safely remove. I think one of the cases was `every
field is inited' to null/0/false/etc'. So that would have covered this
case.

But this was the only really horrible case I was able to find, using
grep. I didn't measure the amount of jitted code, but it was probably
very large. It was probably:

mov eax, 0xdeadbeef
mov [eax], 0

Which is likely on the order of 12 bytes (don't quote me, I haven't
looked it up). Take that times the number of fields there. *ugh*.
