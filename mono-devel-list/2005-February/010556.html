<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i>I didn't build from cvs, so I actually used ./configure, but yes, I did:
</I>&gt;<i>./configure --prefix=/usr
</I>&gt;<i>make
</I>&gt;<i>sudo make install
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>In Ubuntu, the root account is disabled so generally we always use sudo.
</I>
Sounds pretty stupid to me (from a security point of view - it's almost
as insane as Linspire doing *everything* as root!)

&gt;<i>However, for other reasons I enabled the root account. So, logging into 
</I>&gt;<i>root (with su), I also tried &quot;make install&quot; and got the same error.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>... which is quite odd now that I think about it... Why would it be 
</I>&gt;<i>complaining about /usr/local/lib when I configured using /usr? 
</I>
It shouldn't. Out of interest, which version of automake and autoconf
are you using there? It sounds like something is a bit bust. Have you
made it before in /usr/local?

&gt;<i>I originally tried configuring to usr/local/ but had some weird build 
</I>&gt;<i>errors so I redownloaded the source from mono-project.com/downloads and 
</I>&gt;<i>then built against /usr and it built without any problems.
</I>
It sounds like there is some left over from the previous build to me.
Check /usr/local/lib vs /usr/lib to see if any of the mono libs have
been put into /usr/local/lib. If they have, hose them.

TTFN

Paul
