</I>Class1.cs catches all the exceptions and prints the text of them into
the results file, if I understand correct your question.

&gt;<i> So maybe there is no reference (original) &quot;catalog.xml&quot;, right?
</I>Sorry, I again do not understand what you just said. If you mean that
there is no original catalog.xml, it's a part of OASIS test suite. My
catalog-out.xml is produced from the original catalog by a simple XSL,
so it ended up in the same dir.

&gt;<i> Well, apparently Xalan test collection is less than MS tests, so
</I>&gt;<i> it is great that now we can easily test MS test collections with
</I>&gt;<i> your testcode ;-) I'll modify Class1.cs as runnable under 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;standalone_tests&quot; (and file name as well ;-) and check into svn.
</I>Cool! Than probably it's better to use my XSL on the up-to date OASIS
catalog.xml to make updated catalog-out.xml, see the attached file.

&gt;<i> BTW am on reviewing your patch and committed some of them. Now
</I>&gt;<i> the error (well, different result) cases are 438, from 557.
</I>&gt;<i> It is very nice :-) I'll continue my review and mail you later.
</I>Yes, I hope that changes in this patch are very simple, so there will be
no problems with them. There is another patch, which I named
&quot;notsogood.patch&quot;, there we will probably have problems.

&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Atsushi Eno
</I>Thank you, too.
I'm still working on the enum issue, BTW, so you will hear from me today.
