<PRE>Hi,

So I've largely finished applying the patch. I still have some
pending stuff:

xslnumber.patch
	I need more precise understanding about number formatting
	which is expected in XSLT spec (or please point the related
	spec section number in your patch).

xsforeach.patch
	I need clarification on the purpose of this patch.
	Performance?

xsltcompiledcontext.patch
	I need clarification. What if there are foo-bar and foo_bar?

xslstylesheet.patch
locationpathpattern.patch
	I need clarification on the purpose of these patches.
	With OASIS's stable archive I could not find any improvements.

xmlwriteremitter.patch
	I should reject this patch. It is enough to invoke
	String.Replace() just once (because it replaces all
	the matching string occurence). Also, two WriteComment()
	without object creation is better than allocating another
	string object in general.

parser.patch
	It actually broke the build. We already have ErrorOutput
	maybe for the same purpose.

whitespacenodes.patch
	Let me read the spec in depth. Without related spec section
	it is impossible to determine if the patch is fine (and that
	part is one of the difficult part of XSLT).

For now, am going to make our standalone tests runnable with the
new archive and/or reuse your test runner. I prefer mine only
because there are several options, but in the meantime it is easier
to reuse Class1.cs.

I believe all the rest part of the patch is in svn, but tell me if
there was missing. In general very nice patches :-)

Thanks,
Atsushi Eno
