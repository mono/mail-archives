Yes, I fished this example from the diff. How did you search this 
specific test case?

&gt;<i> There is no &quot;catalog.xml&quot; in testsuite/TESTS/MSFT_Conformance_Tests
</I>&gt;<i> in that OASIS test archive, unless I am specially filtered ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> catalog.xml is only in testsuite/TESTS/Xalan_Conformance_Tests in

</I>
If you download this zip: 
<A HREF="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/9584/XSLT-testsuite-03.ZIP">http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/9584/XSLT-testsuite-03.ZIP</A>

there is catalog.xml in testsuite/TESTS directory. That's the one I used.

&gt;<i> BTW it would be very nice if you split the patches per individual
</I>&gt;<i> problem you fixed. Also, &quot;svn diff&quot; format would be better.
</I>
Hmm, I used diff -Naur to produce a patch. What's the way to make a 
patch in &quot;svn diff&quot; format?

&gt;<i> What I am really afraid is that the bug will result in incorrect
</I>&gt;<i> listing (as I wrote in MSDN feedback) of the enum type on reflection
</I>&gt;<i> based code editor like MonoDevelop. It is clear and present danger.
</I>
Hm, MonoDevelop then has to solve this problem somehow. What will happen 
if a user defines her own enum where few members have an equal value? 
Then you must go further and forbid such enum members in the language 
like you forbid duplicated cases in switch statement.

Thank you.
Andrew Skiba.
