If somebody needs to set a breakpoint on the ctor, they will set it
there (by explicitly writing public C () {}, and adding a breakpoint),
not by breaking on a field init.

Breaking on something like this is about as uninteresting as it gets. I
see no reason to support it.


&gt;<i> &gt;For now, the thing of setting /optimize to true by default works.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think so, it is only about 'how is it expensive&quot;. We simply do

</I>&gt;<i> warning CS0219. It is also not expensive. Should we optimalize such code 
</I>&gt;<i> out by default as well?
</I>
If the code was not compiled with --debug and not with /o+, I think it
should be removed. Without --debug, there is no way the user wanted to
run the code in a debugger anyways, so why not just remove the
variable? /o+ says that the user is willing to make some sacrifices in
debugability for optimization.

Remember, in the msft jit, if you are *not* in debug mode, the following
code:

int a = GetFoo ();

Console.WriteLine (a);

int b = GetBar ();

Console.WriteLine (b);

The variables `a' and `b' will use the same stack slot or register.
However, if you are running in a debugger, they will use different stack
slots. Why? because somebody running under the debugger might want to
see what the value of `a' was when they are at the end of this block.


&gt;<i> &gt;(nb, I realize that jump optimizations are done by the jit, etc. But
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;there might be other more expensive optimizations that are not done by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the jit, or optimizations that are so expensive that they would only be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;done at aot time, so that it would be cool to do them at compile time as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;well.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I think jump/try/catch optimalizations are done by ILASM and not primary

</I>
The msft compiler does not use ilasm.
