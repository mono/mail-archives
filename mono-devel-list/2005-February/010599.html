<PRE>Hello Everyone,

I am new to MONO and embarking into a totally new environment. I am an
experienced developer with considerable experience in C/C++, Java on
both WIndows and Linux platforms. I have used VB to some degree but
prefer Delphi over it (;-))

Anyway, I have been browsing the MONO website documentation and found
that various API's have &quot;To be added&quot; assigned to them. My question
targets the System.DirectoryServices classes and was wondering if they
can be used to build LDAP applications yet?

Novell's iFolder Client seems to be built using MONO and it does access
an LDAP store so I was hoping that I could get come feedback from those
who have tried building LDAP applications before.

Any feedback/comments is appreciated,
Thanks,
Shaffin Bhanji.
