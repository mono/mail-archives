The first two arguments apply. However, the third argument does NOT apply
in the reverse direction. The purpose of mono is to be able to run any
application that the Microsoft runtime can run. It is NOT to achieve 100%
standards compliance, or to create its own separate niche in the linux
market. If a user writes a program and gets it to work under Microsoft
.NET, and subsequently, that program does not work in mono, that is a bug
in mono. The reverse is NOT true: a program which works in mono and does
not work in MS.NET is a buggy program.

The patch _should_ be accepted. The reverse patch should _not_ be accepted,
ever. Miguel agrees with my point of view, by the way.
