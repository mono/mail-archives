<PRE>                                         Hi,

  Currently, we never unload assemblies even if all appdomains using them are
unloaded, so this isn't a big problem now. Later, when assemblies are unloaded,
we will fix this as well.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm also not sure how this ties in with the GC implementation, that is,
</I>&gt;<i> if the method wrapper cache induces a live reference to a particular
</I>&gt;<i> method and the parent class, which somehow might stop an AppDomain from
</I>&gt;<i> being unloaded. But if it doesn't cause the GC to improperly unload an
</I>&gt;<i> AppDomain, then their is still the issue of not recollecting dead
</I>&gt;<i> wrappers from the method wrapper cache. I'm not sure how XSP works, but
</I>&gt;<i> if it is anything like IIS, then this could be a potential memory leak.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, since their is only a single method wrapper cache and
</I>&gt;<i> guarding mutex, thread contention between threads (from different
</I>&gt;<i> AppDomains) competing for access to the one and same cache could occur.
</I>&gt;<i> This problem is exacerbated when one considers that the different
</I>&gt;<i> threads may be trying to acquire method wrappers to methods that may be
</I>&gt;<i> exclusive to a particular AppDomain.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So unless I have missed something in the code, it seems this problem
</I>&gt;<i> could rear its ugly head at some point in the future.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If this is indeed an issue not handled elsewhere, the proposed solution
</I>&gt;<i> would be to encapsulate the cache and other supporting variables and
</I>&gt;<i> objects in a context structure per AppDomain. Then the code in marshal.c
</I>&gt;<i> would then be modified to use the marshaling context for the current
</I>&gt;<i> AppDomain.
