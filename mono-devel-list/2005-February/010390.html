<PRE>First, just wanted to let everyone know that I'm working on getting
Mono compiling in MSVC.  I've mainly been working in VC 6, but ran
into a couple conflicts with source that required the updated platform
SDK.  I get undefined errors without the SDK, and problems with some
of the SDK headers when it is included, something to due with defining
the platform your targetting, I believe.  I'll post errors if anyone
thinks they can help with it, but barring that I'll be trying it in
VS.Net in the next day or two to see if it resolves the issues.  I'd
really like it to work in 6 though, for backwards compatibility.

To speed up my project creation though, I was wondering if anyone had
a dependancy tree for the libraries, and/or a list of the libraries
themselves.  I've been able to piece together most of it by reading
through makefiles, I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Thanks ahead of time, hope you all can use this somehow when I'm done!
