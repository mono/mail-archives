Yes, the fact that the index could be signed is an issue, but in
any case for now both the index and the string *must* be local
variables of the method, so that SSA can track their assignments.

</I>
All the messy work of analyzing branch conditions and applying them
to dominated BBs is already coded, and should not be changed.
Inserting string lengths into the evaluation graph would be enough
(integer variables are obviously already there).
Then the evaluation graph must be traversed when getchar opcodes
are found (just like now for ldelema).

</I>
Maybe I'm just picky, but it seems to me that the check is performed
on the index before the shift.
So, for strings with a length in the range 0x40000000-0x7fffffff
any index in that range would be valid when checked, but become
negative just after the shift (defying the bounds check).
Is this true?

Ciao,
