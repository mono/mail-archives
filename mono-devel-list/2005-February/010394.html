Error messages may help or give a clue to people that might know the answer.

You might want to read the toplevel configure.in and the win32 makefile
in libgc, too.
With automake we use helper libraries, but there is no reason you need to
do the same: if you can, you should just build almost all the files into
a mono.dll shared lib. Anyway, the helper libs we use are:

libgc/libmonogc.la
mono/utils/libmonoutils.la
mono/os/unix/libmonoos.la // you want the win32 version here
mono/os/libmonoos.la
mono/metadata/libmetadata.la
mono/metadata/libmonoruntime.la
mono/mini/libmono.la

You should just skip mint and the arch directory and the other libs that
aren't important for a first cut. The libs first on the list are
usually pre-reqs for libs further down.
At the end of the process there should be only one shared library,
mono.dll. All the others are just built only as temporary libs
used by the build tools like genmdesc.
