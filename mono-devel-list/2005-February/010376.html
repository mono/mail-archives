<PRE>Hi all,
   I know I will be critized for building mono on windows but I do not have 
a nix machine available to me at this point.  Here is what I have done so 
far.  I downloaded the latest stable release of mono and installed it on XP. 
I downloaded the latest cygwin setup and installed the pieces that need to 
be installed.  I got the latest mcs, mono, and xsp source from svn (using 
tortoisesvn).  I started my cygwin bash shell and cd'd into the directory 
containing all my source for mono.  then cd'd into the mono directory 
specifically.  I ran the following command ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr/local 
which generated my make file, I do believe.  I then ran the 'make' command 
and it built a lot of source but failed on building mcs with the following 
command:

csc.exe /nologo /optimize -d:NET_1_1 -d ONLY_1_1 /debug:full /target:exe 
/out:mcs.exe cs-parser.cs @../build/deps/mcs.exe.response
The error that occurred is that it could not find csc.exe.  If I am 
understanding things correctly it is looking for the Microsoft csc compiler 
because I was able to compile the mcs directory with vs 2003 with no 
problem.  I made sure my path environmental variable contained the latest ms 
.net framework directory which didn't help.

I'm almost to the promised land but I am getting hung up on the reference to 
csc.exe.  Any help would be appreciated.  My forehead is completely flat from 
beating my head against the proverbial wall today.  I think I need a beer or 
maybe a swig of something a little stronger. 

Forgot to mention that I navigated to the directory where csc.exe is located 
(%system)\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v1.1.4322 and typed in csc.exe to just see 
if It(cygwin) would run it.  (Yes I have never worked in the 'nix environment 
before, can you tell?)  It would not.  I looked for a run, exec, execute, 
shell command, anything that would allow me to run that from my bash 
environment to no avail.  Okay, I'm off (My wife would say in more ways than 
one.  :) )


Thank you for any help you may be able to provide,
