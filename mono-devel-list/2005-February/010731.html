&gt;<i> More specifically, it will look like
</I>&gt;<i> Windows, which might as well be ass on Gnome/KDE. :-)
</I>
Worse, it'll look like Windows 95, which looked like ass even on Windows
95...  XP isn't exactly a Mac, but when an app does its themeing correctly,
it's a hell of a lot better than the 95 look.


&gt;<i> What's my point in all this?  I'm not sure I have one.  It's more to
</I>&gt;<i> enlighten you to the potential problems you may see, and that there are
</I>&gt;<i> reasons that developers won't be use System.Windows.Forms even after
</I>&gt;<i> it's complete.
</I>
Just to throw in my 2c, I for one actually _like_ a lot of things about
SWF's model, especially the Whidbey version.  Perhaps that's just because
I've not yet done more than the simplest of playing in GTK#, but if there's
anyone else like me around, then there _will_ be a core of developers who
are interested in doing what is necessary to make SWF _not_ look like ass on
other platforms (Linux in my case) to the extent possible.
