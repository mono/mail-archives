<PRE>Well, there isn't a &quot;solution&quot; file because it's MSVC 6, and that's a
VS.Net thing, but the workspace can be imported into .Net just by
opening it up and clicking &quot;yes&quot; a few times.   ( I may provide both a
VS 6 workspace and a VS.Net solution next release, just to
uncomplicate things a little.)

I'll get on it as soon as I get some free time (busy week, at the
moment), but I may be able to have it done by next weekend.  The
reason I worked on 1.0.5 first was to minimize any errors to things I
was doing rather than things that were just bugs.

&gt;<i> *) genmdesc needs to be built as part of the build process,
</I>&gt;<i> since it depends on the currently defined opcodes etc. Using an
</I>&gt;<i> old version may make the build fail. This is less of a problem for

</I>
The genmdesc actually has a project in the workspace that I left in
during my final cleanup.  The work it does isn't automated yet, but I
think I can work that into my next release.

&gt;<i> *) The changes to mini-exceptions.c: it's not enough to comment
</I>&gt;<i> out the code, since it would make stack walking crash: luckily
</I>&gt;<i> it's not a feature that gets used for simple tests, but you'll
</I>&gt;<i> need to find a way to implement the missing bits.
</I>
That one is going to be a little more difficult, as I've never written
code for stack walking before.  I'll do some research, and try to get
it working though.

Thanks for your input everyone, this has turned out pretty well so
far, hope the svn build doesn't give me much trouble so I can get that
out and working, I'd love for these changes to be in a release, make
it easier for anyone that wants to use VS to develope in.
