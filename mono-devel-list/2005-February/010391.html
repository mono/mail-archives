  Subject: Problem compiling from source on Windows XP.


  Hi all,
      I hope that you can offer me some resolution. Here is my environment

  Windows XP SP 2
  uname = CYGWIN_NT-5.1
  GLib 2.0

  From bash shell I did a mkdir in /usr/local for a new directory name src.  I CD'd into this directory then I got latestt code via svn for mono, mcs and gtk-sharp.  Once this was done I CD'd into the mono directory and issued the following command:

  ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr/local --with-preview=yes

  This seemed to run fine.  I then issued the command

  make get-monolite-latest

  This downloaded a file and seemed to pass just fine.  So then I issued the make command.  After a bit of compilation it bombed out in mono/mono/utils/mono-hash.h and mono-hash.c.  It couldn't find the glib.h header file which is located at /usr/local/glib-2.0. (I've included the exact error file generated by make 2&gt;error.txt)  Thinking that maybe the 1.1 unstable branch was to blame I re-issued the ./autogen.sh command leaving off the --with-preview=yes.  This resulted in the same error.  I then included the path the glib.h file in my user Include environmental varaible to no avail.  Same error.  Does anyone know how I can get past this error.

  I had attempted to compile from source last night with the source being on a different drive then my cygwin installation where I ran into a different problem of the make not being able to recognize csc.exe so I removed all source from that directory and checked out all code directly within cygwin.  I'm now getting a different problem which my compile last night was able to get past.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

  Sincerely,
