<PRE>Hi,

I've been fixing my mono area on my home website (which somehow seems to
be broken again with the bloomin' menus - but they're being fixed now -
again!).

The text errors have been fixed with information for Mac users (and even
something for Win32 users) being added.

The svn grabber script has been altered now. The old one was a hack, the
new one is a more capable hack!

Basically, the old one would just grab from svn. The new one checks if
the modules requested are on your HD. If they're not, it checks them
out. If they are, it does an update

Next up, it will compile the code for you and then install (via su -c.
If you have yourself set as sudo, feel free to edit the script). I've
added this in so I can set the grab and compile up as a cron job.

Okay, that's the good news. The bad news is the script isn't complete.

First, it assumes you've done a compile before - I need to add in a
check for (say) ~/mono/makefile. If it's not there, run ./autogen.sh.
This needs repeating for the other modules. I should have something up
for that tonight/tomorrow - I need to fix the menu system first on the
website.

Second, there is no check to ensure the compile was happy. If anyone can
suggest how best to see if the compile has completed without an error (I
have a feeling I'll need to listen for a signal from gcc and/or mcs on
that - not sure which though - I imagine SIGETERM would be the one), I'd
appreciate it.

(as if you don't already know it!)
