<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt; Why should gtk-sharp depend on esound-devel or is it something else
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which gtk-sharp depends on which depends on esound-devel?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't have that package installed here and have no problems compiling.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Requiring esound-devel to build is different from requiring esound-devel
</I>&gt;<i> to install.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> libesd.la is distributed as part of esound-devel, that's why it is
</I>&gt;<i> needed for building from source.
</I>
I'm fully aware of that. I build from svn at least daily and don't have
esound-devel on any of my RH or FC3 systems.

TTFN
