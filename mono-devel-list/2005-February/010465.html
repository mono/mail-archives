I'm not sure what you mean, but if CEE_LDFTN or CEE_LDVIRTFTN
have been seen, it's not safe to remove a method's code, since the
resulting pointer could have been stored anywhere.

&gt;<i> Q: How to track delegates?

</I>
For methods that can be dynamically recompiled or whose address is taken
with ldftn-like instructions, we need to keep the trampoline around
and patch it to jump to the new code.

&gt;<i> Q: How could raw IP -&gt; MonoJitInfo ptr translation be more efficiently 
</I>&gt;<i> made from within signal handler?
</I>
This has a surprising cost in exception handling, too (the profiler signal
handler should likely just store the ip and not do much processing).

&gt;<i> A: I thought of adding a pointer to the MonoJitInfo structure -ptr_size 
</I>&gt;<i> bytes before the first opcode of the method. Within a signal handler it 
</I>&gt;<i> should be quite easy to obtain the starting address of the current 
</I>&gt;<i> method as bp-1 points to after the method call opcode and e.g. on amd64 
</I>&gt;<i> one opcode before r11 gets loaded with the call target...
</I>
This is not a solution: the amd64 call sequence needs to be changed to
not do that, since it's too slow (and you wouldn't handle virtual calls
that way etc).
For a number of reasons, the jit info lookup should also become
lock-free, so ideas and patches to make this function faster are welcome.

&gt;<i> Q: How to interface with C# code?
</I>&gt;<i> A: I thought about adding some new class in a custom Mono namespace that 
</I>&gt;<i>  returns a wrapper around the MonoJitInfo structure. (Read only of 
</I>&gt;<i> course and probably without the information about the code location, but 
</I>&gt;<i> with information about optimizations, weight, recompile-times, probably 
</I>&gt;<i> other profiler data..)
</I>
I don't see the need to expose MonoJitInfo to C# code, we're also not
going to make that structure larger: it needs to remain light-weight
for the default case (it will actually be shrinked).
