We get bugs like this reported every so often. It is pretty clear that
there is production code relying on the thing.

I don't like it one bit, but I'd rather not get get the bug again.

The issue seems to be that because there was no Find (array, predicate),
where predicate is a Predicate &lt;T&gt;, people relied on using two different
types.

In theory we should thus be able to ignore this problem in generics.
However, because code that used IndexOf might now use IndexOf&lt;T&gt;, it
seems logical to keep compat with the old code.
