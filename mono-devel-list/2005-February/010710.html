<PRE>Hi,

As part of expanding my mono coverage on my homesite (which is getting
blasted now by people visiting the build pages), I'm adding howto
compile instructions for Win32 (cygwin), Solaris (x86), OSX and when
someone manages it, ARM/XScale at some point in the next day or so.

What I'm also considering doing is putting up short programs
demonstrating how to do things in mono (such as MySQL database work and
some MWF material). Can anyone see the value in this and more over,
anyone fancy doing some small demonstration code to show how to (say)
write something with gtk-sharp or even some really basic string and
maths manipulation?

I should have the SQL stuff up by the end of the week with some very
simple MWF code as well (possibly even to integrate with the SQL stuff,
but as the MWF data pieces aren't there yet, that may have to hold off).

<A HREF="http://www.all-the-johnsons.co.uk/mono/">http://www.all-the-johnsons.co.uk/mono/</A>

(there may even be another version of the monoupdater script for the end
of the week...)

TTFN

Paul
