<PRE>I was having some horrible trouble compiling Mono from SVN as well as the 
latest source release.... until today when I tried one last SVN time before 
giving up for quite some time and trying to come up with a bug-report.... 
and it worked!

Btw I think it might have been my NPTL + AMD64 + Gentoo setup that was 
causing it, since I hadn't really made the whole system NPTL the last time I 
compiled Mono on the laptop.
So yeah... kudos to whoever patched the SVN sources to make it work, you 
made my day! [Since I love C# and didn't wanna revert to SSH-devel to my 
desktop which is horrible for OpenGL as you can imagine.. nor did I want to 
have to use Windows]
Enough ranting and what-not...

Thanks!
