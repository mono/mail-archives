<PRE>Hi there guys, 

I have been trying to make a sharp wrapper for libsvg-cairo and it was
quite easy. The most dificult part was for me to understand the XPath (I
think it is XPath, but I'm not sure).

But hey, 

I had to make some changed to the gapi-fixup.cs, the reason is simple
there wasn't any remove-node, and I had to remove some nodes, by hand
was far to easy, but hey no cheating.

Then I came across another problem, that i didn't fixed completly.
When a guy defines the .metadata he assumes that there is some kind of
order, as it must be.

For instance, if you want to move a node and then change some property
in it. That implies that the node is in the place you want. If the
move-node is executed before the attr or after has a great deal of
implications.

In the current version, all atributions are made first and only then are
nodes moved. That is in my opinion wrong.
Reason: If you are going to move a node and change some properties it
makes more sense to move it first.

(I should be sleeping for many hours, so excuse me ).

So a fix is to place the attr action after all the others that imply the
manipulation of the tree.

I send here the complete file, to make things more clearer (I hope).

PS: I asked in #mono what to do, and kangaroo told me to send it here.


Cheers,
SpigaZ out...

If only I had some spare time....
