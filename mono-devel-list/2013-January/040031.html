<PRE>Do you see these issues when running with the soft debugger attached?
If so, that was a bug which was fixed a few days ago. If you're seeing
the issue without the debugger, a small testcase would be great for
figuring this out.

</I>&gt;<i> would have to do some exploration to find all the right pointers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does the code in GetFunctionPointerForDelegate emit a managed wrapper that

</I>&gt;<i> anything obviously related to threading, but I imagine it'd be taken care of
</I>&gt;<i> at a lower level in any case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We could easily be convinced the bugs we saw were GC or threading related,
</I>&gt;<i> as they could only be explained by corruption of things that shouldn't be
</I>&gt;<i> corruptible, like reflection and array bounds.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or is there additional code or attributes we should be using to ensure
</I>&gt;<i> correct operation?
