<PRE>We are not using the debugger.

We're not sure how the library in question creates its threads. We
don't have access to its source code and it's proprietary. Putting
together a full repro would be hard.

The callback is a simple function which picks up a logged string and
sends it to NLog by way of an Rx Subject. That's a lot of moving
parts, but they all work fine when the callback comes from one of our
threads.

Am I correct in assuming that the GetFunctionPointerForDelegate should
automatically register the thread it's called on with mono? I have
enough facts at hand to call the registration function manually if
need be, but it would be awkward indeed.
