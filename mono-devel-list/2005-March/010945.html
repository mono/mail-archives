True.

&gt;<i> As far I am concerned, we can work off-line to begin with.  It will take

</I>&gt;<i> with the overhead of an SVN module yet.  Still, we should really have 
</I>&gt;<i> version control from the beginning.
</I>
Hmm, I can only think of some darcs-like version control system if we want to 
work off-line but with VCS support. Later, we can still change to svn.


&gt;<i> As for development environment, I am constrained to keep my primary 
</I>&gt;<i> workspace in M$ using Visual Studio, but I have a VMWare partition with 
</I>&gt;<i> Linux and a (fairly) current Mono install.
</I>
Ok, I don't have Visual Studio here.. Is it possible to use NANT as build system 
in VS?

&gt;<i> Along with these additions to the language, I think we might want to go 
</I>&gt;<i> back through and evaluate certain structures in the existing language 
</I>&gt;<i> set.  For example, are variant types really necessary?
</I>
Yes, we have to agree on some initial starting set. AFAIK variants were heavily 
used in DB code, but since everything's an object now...

&gt;<i> Another question that comes up concerns the runtime.  Is the rtl simple 
</I>&gt;<i> enough to let the compiler translate the Delphi like structure into CLI 
</I>&gt;<i> library access, or will we need to build a something.objectpascal 
</I>&gt;<i> library that needs to deploy with any applications?  Again, my lack of 
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge of the newer versions is bugging me.
</I>
AFAIK Borland ships some library. I guess this is particularly needed for the 
meta-class concept, we do not find in C# / Java. (And who else has virtual 
constructors?)
