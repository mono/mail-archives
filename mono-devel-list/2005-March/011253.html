</I>Well, I did that, but I was having hard time trying to get it working:

[mybox MJ12node]#  mono --profile=heap:outfile MJ12nodeMono.exe

** (MJ12nodeMono.exe:22297): WARNING **: Error loading profiler module 
'mono-profiler-heap': libmono-profiler-heap.so: cannot open shared 
object file: No such file or directory

---

I have written lots of text about this issue and then realised that 
actual filename (as compiled by the library) is 
libmono-profiler-desc-heap however README was asking to use just 'heap', 
so it could not find file
as it was looking for libmono-profiler-heap.so --- it was hard to 
understand whats going on because humans tend to skip the middle part of 
the word, so it was not immediately apparent that 'desc' was missing.

The reason for this is what appears to be incorrect README entry:  Run 
mono --profile=heap:outfile, then run mono-heap-prof-view

It should read as: Run mono --profile=desc-heap:outfile, then run 
mono-heap-prof-view

---

Anyhow it seems to be running now, so I am happy that it worked after 
all and I hope I will be able to grasp what leaks memory, will keep you 
posted and thanks for help  :)
