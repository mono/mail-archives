<PRE>Hello Eyal,

&gt;<i> We are now about ready to start sending code which is specific to our
</I>&gt;<i> configuration to the Mono trunc.
</I>
Great news!

&gt;<i> The code we will send will be surrounded by '#if J2EE' or '#if !J2EE'. We
</I>&gt;<i> will be both making additions to existing files as well as adding new files.
</I>
I have been thinking about this.  I believe that J2EE might be
confusing;  Maybe it should be called &quot;JVM&quot; or &quot;TARGET_JVM&quot;, which is a
more accurate description of what the patch does.

&gt;<i> We would probably start with our specific code for System.Xml - we have
</I>&gt;<i> relatively fewer changes there.
</I>
Sounds great.

&gt;<i> What is the approach you would like us to adopt? We could post the changes to
</I>&gt;<i> the dev-list, or we could commit them directly to svn.
</I>
Lets use the same approach that we follow for all the other patches: we
get the patches into mono-devel-list (for now, it would be good to CC
the maintainer, in this case Atsushi, as there are some reported
problems with the lists today, following a server migration).

Then after approval (which we typically time out if nobody objects) we
get those changes into the repository.  

For smaller changes, you can commit directly, but you must be ready to
answer or fix things if the patch introduces a regression or the
maintainer would like the code reworked.

It should not take long I think.

best wishes!
Miguel
