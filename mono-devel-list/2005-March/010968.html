This is quite interesting.  I've gone back and searched my archive of 
the list looking for references to Chrome, Pascal, Delphi, etc.

While I found several people asking if there was support for Pascal or 
if it was planned, there was not a single message about compatible, 
existing solutions.  Not commercial, open source, or even vaporware.

This doesn't mean that it didn't happen, my archive isn't all that old.


And to paraphrase Todd:

I have no interest in any  Proprietary, Closed Source, Compiler 
technology.  Closed Source without cost is just another way of promoting 
product lock-in, while giving warm-fuzzies to those who only look at the 
superficial level.

Oh well, I'll stop my rant now.
