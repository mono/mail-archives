<PRE>We have a pretty big set of .NET solutions/projects that we would like
to build in the latest Mono and get running on Linux/OSX. They consist
of C#, VB.NET, and one small C++ project that does some native Windows
interfacing.  At this point it's about .25 million lines of code.  Is
there a utility somewhere that can create a Mono &quot;make&quot; compatible
environment: generate makefiles, etc?  I'm assuming we may have to rip
the C++ features out of the code to get a Mono version going at first
(it's only a small subset). 

Once we get the ball rolling with this project we'll probably be
contributing quite a few fixes back to Mono and maybe some features.  We
have a large test suite that utilizes quite a bit of the .NET Framework
and VB.NET.

Do you guys have a good example of an architecture for building cross
platform .NET code, with respect to utilizing each platform's unmanaged
strengths where possible (like Windows or OSX specific APIs, for
example)?

We're also interested in investigating the .NET 2.0 compatible branch of
Mono.  Does anyone have any comments on its stability at this point?  I
couldn't find this on the web site.
