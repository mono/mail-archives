<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> support for debian would be nice.
</I>
In what way? It has already been successfully built for debian.
Instructions for building from source

As my chosen distro is not supporting mono (looks like someone at RH has
thrown their toys out of the pram), I may have to build the rpms and put
them up there. I have enough space and bandwidth to do the same with any
non-prebuilt versions (such as .deb files) should someone want to do
that.

TTFN

Paul
