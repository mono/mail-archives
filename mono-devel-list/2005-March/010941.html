I have ported JFlex to C# and made it available as a sourceforge project:

<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/csflex/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/csflex/</A>

There is one release there, and I have successfully used it in conjunction
with my other port of Java CUP (C# CUP, not currently on sourceforge but
downloadable at <A HREF="http://israel.........../cup_gui/">http://israel.........../cup_gui/</A>) to make a parser for a
significant superset of the C# language.

I don't know how .jay compares to C# CUP, but I do know that C# CUP and C#
Flex interoperate seamlessly (as do Java CUP and JFlex on the Java side of
things). You shouldn't have any problems making it serve tokens to Jay with
a simple adapter or what have you, but if it is an issue, I can certainly
recommend C# CUP. It is a table-driven LALR(1) parser generator. Beware of
the backtracking option, though; I added it myself, and while it works
perfectly in some cases, in others it seems to end up with a completely
incorrect sequence of tokens. I have yet to figure out what the problem is.
The reason it is not a sourceforge project is that I have yet to hear back
from the project author. Maybe I'll just give up on that and make it
available as is my right anyway according to the license. :-)

Good luck with your project,

Jonathan Gilbert
