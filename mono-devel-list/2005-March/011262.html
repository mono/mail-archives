</I>It appears I have located at least one place in software that results in 
huge memory consumption
and it appears to be close to what I got reported by users of my 
software. Here is GC printout:

Note last few iterations -- memory usage grown BIG time all of a sudden, 
and what I find
interesting is that GC says that it increased heap after allocating 0 
(zero) bytes!!! 8-O

I am digging in now to try to get more information about where in my 
software exactly it happens and
any possible explanations to whether what happens is expected (you never 
know, maybe my
code tried to allocated gigabyte of RAM?)

Alex

p.s. Adding some nice formatting to big numbers would make them more 
readable...
