I would suggest that you look into this document:
<A HREF="http://www.mfconsulting.com/product/monoinstaller/MonoForWin32Developer.html">http://www.mfconsulting.com/product/monoinstaller/MonoForWin32Developer.html</A>

Notice the order in which you see things being install.  You don't have 
to install Visual Studio if you don't want to but at the very least if 
you are going to do applications that build using Microsoft C# compiler 
(csc.exe) then get the .NET Framework SDK 1.1

I recommend you this because the Gtk# Win32 Installer for the .NET 
Framework SDK includes a code sample of a Glade#/Gecko# application that 
you could use to guide your future efforts.  If you only want to have 
the Mono 1.1.4 for Windows installed on your computer, then installing 
the GRE will do.

The Gecko Rendering Engine (GRE) as we are trying to implemented on 
Windows is in an early stage.  I have decided not to couple the 
installer of the GRE with the installer of either the Mono 1.1.4 
Installer or the Gtk# Runtime and SDK installers for Windows.  The 
library modules that bind the embedded Mozilla GRE are distributed and 
already part of the respective GAC (MS and Mono where appropriate), so 
you just need to install the GRE and then just compile the Browser 
Sample I mentioned above.

Hope this helps.

Paco
