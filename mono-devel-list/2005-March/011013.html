<PRE>&gt;<i>Who uses Pascal anymore?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I use it on a daily base.

&gt;<i>Hasn't everyone (that's serious) moved on to C++, Java and/or C#?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I also write C# programs. (I leave out Java and C++ in this mail)

&gt;<i>Are there jobs in Pascal anymore?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, there are. But most are not &quot;plain&quot; Pascal, they are Delphi. Ever 
used Delphi for GUI or Server applications? C# is a really good language 
(it also shares the same father Delphi has) with lots of potentical. But 
everybody has a prefered language he wants to write programs in. My is 
Delphi, but I also write programs in C# if I think C# is the better 
language for it. For example I write an ASP.NET application in C# and 
not in Delphi.NET because I want it to work in Mono, too. But I write an 
GUI application in Delphi because Delphi's VCL is still a killer framework.

&gt;<i>It makes little sense to hack up something such as a Pascal compiler (no small task, btw) if no
</I>&gt;<i>one except the three people working on it will use it--or care if it exists.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>That depends on marketing.

&gt;<i>If someone has academic interests I would say go for it;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Have you ever looked at Delphi. If your knowledge comes from &quot;old&quot; 
Pascal then you do not know that Delphi has envolved the Pascal language 
for years. Ever heard of &quot;virtual constructors&quot;, one of the features I 
really like in Delphi because it can make life really easy. If you want 
virtual constructors in C# you must use the Activator and Reflection. 
And even then it is more or less a undertake without compile-time type 
checks.

&gt;<i>Pascal is definitely a great language;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Sure, but the Delphi language is a more powerfull language.
