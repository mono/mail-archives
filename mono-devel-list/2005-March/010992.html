<PRE>Well,

Concerning the amount of debate spawned by a simple attempt start this 
project, I've come to a couple of conclusions.

1) Very few people care about the project
2) Official support will be limited
3) Opposition from commercial interests exists

Personally, I don't feel that these are enough reason to stop an open 
source project, but at the same time, I don't feel that a NEW project 
can succeed in the current environment.  I'd love to be proven wrong, 
but I don't have the time or money to evangelize enough to overcome the 
opposition.  Besides if I did spend the time evangelizing, I'm not 
programming and what good would that be?

What should we do about this then?

I would love to be able to develop a Pascal compiler, but I don't see it 
happening in conjunction with Mono at this time.

On that note I will say this much.  I am not a politician, I am a 
programmer.  If people can work out the politics to get a Pascal 
Compiler project started, I will be happy to participate.  What I will 
not do is spend anymore of MY TIME on debate about whether MY TIME is 
best spent on this project or on something else.  It is simply MY TIME 
and I will spend it where I choose, big impact on the community or not.

--Grant
