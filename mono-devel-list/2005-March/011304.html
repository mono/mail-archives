<PRE>I was just wondering what is the degree of support for &quot;unsafe&quot; code in 
Mono?

I had a few modules with unsafe code compiled in VS 2003 and they seem 
to run okay,
but I have not found much about whether this apparent support for 
&quot;unsafe&quot; code is 100% complete,
or mostly working etc?

My primary interest is using pointers to read/modify data directly in 
heap using &quot;fixed&quot; command
to make sure GC won't move data. My experience shows that &quot;unsafe&quot; codes 
has some very nice performance
gains that are very important for my application, should I be wary of 
using that code in Mono?

regards,

Alex
