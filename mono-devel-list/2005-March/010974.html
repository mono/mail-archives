<PRE>Mr. Willibald

Upload you source code to svn under some Open Source licence and you
will see patches flowing in (if you are patient enough).

Otherwise I am forced to interpret your calls for co-operation as a
vicious intention to &quot;hiring&quot; some Mono developers to work for you.
alt.jobs.offered would be the right place for you not the mono lists.

I am recommending a dose of &quot;The Cathedral and Bazaar&quot; if you are too
overwhelmed and confused about what Open Source is all about.

Regards,
Jambunathan K.

&gt;<i> Willibald,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But you have the command line preview...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why is it not in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mono cvs, if it's the standard Pascal compiler? Everything's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there, except some Pascal compiler.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why would it be in the Mono cvs? Chrome is a closed-source commercial
</I>&gt;<i> product, it's not open source. I made that clear in my original post.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hmm, before starting coding a new compiler I want to hear
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what Miguel says about all this. If it's true that Novell
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; already chose Chrome to be the standard Pascal compiler and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; does support it with internal resources,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please do not read more into my words then i said.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think a new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compiler will be superfluent and will never have the official
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; blessing of Novell.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Letting alone any Open Source vs. Commercial debate, i think that in
</I>&gt;<i> general it's superfluous if 35 different groups reinvent the wheel
</I>&gt;<i> simultaneously, just for the sake of &quot;doing it themselves&quot;. I honestly
</I>&gt;<i> believe that Chrome will bring a lot to the table for Mono Pascal
</I>&gt;<i> developers, and there's a lot to be gained by working together rather
</I>&gt;<i> then against or parallel each other, duplicating the effort.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As i said before we're open for input, feedback and assistance with
</I>&gt;<i> Chrome on /many/ levels, not necessarily restricted to pure testing and
</I>&gt;<i> feedback, and i'd be very interested in getting people involved in
</I>&gt;<i> actual coding tasks related to the project (although, one month before
</I>&gt;<i> release of our 1.0 version it's doubtful that it would make sense to
</I>&gt;<i> have someone new come in and - say - rewrite the core parser ;-).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Stuff that needs work (and would directly benefit Mono in particular)
</I>&gt;<i> are things like integration with MonoDevelop (which we have planned but
</I>&gt;<i> currently don't have resources to spare on, as we do have a very small
</I>&gt;<i> team working on Chrome), which should be a very fun project for one or
</I>&gt;<i> two people that want to get involved with both Chrome and Mono (we've
</I>&gt;<i> got quite a bit architecture in place already from our VS integration
</I>&gt;<i> that could be leveraged, so this wouldn't be to extensive a project
</I>&gt;<i> either).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also interesting to do would be testing and prepping the compiler under
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;more exotic&quot; platforms supported by mono (which, to me means
</I>&gt;<i> non-x86-Windows/Linux &lt;g&gt;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Honestly, this is really bad news, as mono will have some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; open source VB and C# (maybe sometimes C) compiler, but a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; closed source Pascal one.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Commercial&quot; doesn't necessarily mean &quot;bad&quot;. We're very dedicated to
</I>&gt;<i> Chrome, and i can promise you right here and now that Chrome will not
</I>&gt;<i> ever be a Kylix. I can also promise you that if for whatever reason
</I>&gt;<i> RemObjects would decide to discontinue Chrome (which i cannot anticipate
</I>&gt;<i> happening), chances are good that we would make it available on some
</I>&gt;<i> open source basis to ensure it continues to live (given there's
</I>&gt;<i> community interest). Not, as i said, that is see this happening; our
</I>&gt;<i> commitment to Chrome is very firm.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm a burned child with closed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; source Pascal compilers on Linux, so please forgive me that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm somewhat skeptical about yours.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I understand that very well. But again we are not Borland, and Chrome is
</I>&gt;<i> not Kylix.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Additionally you do not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seem to have any use for us other than forgetting about the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; open source Delphi compiler and supporting your closed source
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one without getting anything (some fun part - whatever) back.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> See my comment on that above. I don't think this is true, as we'd be
</I>&gt;<i> very happy to get people involved with the project with tasks that are
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;fun&quot; and go beyond testing and feedbacking (though they'd necessarily
</I>&gt;<i> /start/ with that)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Basically this would be another situation as the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Borland-&gt;Kylix 'community' is in now. A dead end:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's no such thing as 100% certainty, surely not in this industry and
</I>&gt;<i> not anywhere else in life. That said, i can guarantee you with 99%
</I>&gt;<i> certainty that this is /not/ going to happen with Chrome.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And no one told the mono
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; community about it - or did you post any Chrome news on this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; list over the last few months? I can not remember a single
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; post. If mono is that important for you, I guess you should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have -
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> See Todd's reply: we certainly have. Looking back thru my inbox, i
</I>&gt;<i> actually do see /you/ participating in discussion about Chrome, a
</I>&gt;<i> several months back ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let me close by saying that i think and hope that there's room here for
</I>&gt;<i> open source (Mono) and commercial (Chrome) software to co-exist and
</I>&gt;<i> support each other for mutual benefit - rather then working against each
</I>&gt;<i> other.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's not my place to judge the use of anyone's personal time, but given
</I>&gt;<i> the fact that we all have a limited amount of it, it would seem to me
</I>&gt;<i> it's much better spend working together rather then rewriting things yet
</I>&gt;<i> again, just for the sake of it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But that's just MHO.
