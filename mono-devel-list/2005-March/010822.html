Sorry that you once more had to point me to something I should have
found, but somehow the config file slipped through my search when I
grepped for all libintl occurences.

Anyways the dll mapping is a very good thing! Because on windows the
libintl is actually installed as intl.dll.a. 
So I didn't delete the dllmapping but changed from libc.so.6 it to intl.
And now i18n works like a charm on windows!!

So I don't know which would be the best long term solution. Others are
more qualified to answer this. But I would suggest to keep the dll
mapping option and add a test to the package that detects on build time
for which platform it is compiled and either locates the appropriate
libraries directly or has a list with predefined mappings for the
detected platfrom.

Thanks for all who helped me with all my i18n problems on windows/linux
now a major blocker for my mono development is solved!

Fabian
