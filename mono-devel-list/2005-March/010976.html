You know what. I read this. Didn't reply. Wanted to. But I didn't. I
reread it and just cant believe it.

Dude.

Come on!

First of all, Marc (we are all friends here I hope) is just posting that
'Hey, we have a product, isnt opensource, but it is free, and it does
what you want, so if you just need the functionality, use it'. Notice
that he isn't attempting to *SELL* you his product, he is just pointing
out that it exists, and that he (personally) doesn't see the need to
replicate functionality. This is just your typical idealistic vs
pragmatic argument, nothing more nothing less.

As for &quot;hiring&quot; some Mono developers, all I saw was his wish that people
be as involved as possible, and he seemed *VERY* willing to work with
individuals looking to become potentially involved. At no point did he
offer a job, or anything like that (at least not that I saw).

And correct me if I am wrong (and I might very well be very very wrong)
but didn't you (Jambunathan) leave Novell (being payed to work on
opensource software) to another place, that pays you more money? So what
issue could you possibly have with someone attempting to make some cash
from his time? If it is all about Open Source, then why was the more
money worth it? If I am totally wrong than I apologize, and I must have
confused your situation with someone elses, again, I preemptively
apologize if that is the case.


Regardless of all this. To *FLAME* someone who is just making people
interested in a Pascal compiler for mono aware of a possible solution to
their problem is insane. And this is coming from someone who flames
without a second thought and loves it. So something is seriously wrong
here :)
