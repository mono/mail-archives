<PRE>Hello,

    Regarding the debate that started over Pascal in the list, I was
asked to comment on it.

    The Mono team will work to ensure that every compiler for the CLI
will work flawlessly on it, and we will work with the various groups
that produce them to address problems in Mono or their compilers.
Proprietary and open source compilers.

    If someone wants to write free implementations of those compilers,
we wish you very much luck.

    In this *particular* case, I would say that if you want to make an
impact in the world, you might have a better chance of achieving this by
taking gcc 4's GIMPLE internal structures and make it output CIL instead
of writing a new Pascal compiler.

    There is an existing good one (RemObjects), and you are free to
compete with it, but your energy might be better employed in something
that would have a larger impact than competing with the niche Pascal
market.

Miguel.
