<PRE>&gt;<i> Rather then reinventing the wheel and writing another Pascal compiler
</I>&gt;<i> for Mono, why not get involved with Chrome a bit more and help us make
</I>&gt;<i> sure Chrome will suit the needs of Mono developers? We could use
</I>&gt;<i> assistance and feedback from the Mono crowd on many levels.
</I>
I'm not quite sure I understand where you see us fit in the Chrome project. 
Doing compiler related things is - obviously - out of the question. So this 
leaves beta-testing and writing some class libraries. IOW: The fun part (as I 
see it) is already taken, which leaves the non-fun but necessary parts.

BTW: I wasn't aware of the fact that you give your command line edition away for 
free.

&gt;<i> I've spoken with Miguel extensively on several occasions about Chrome
</I>&gt;<i> and our support for Mono, and he was very enthusiastic and supportive of
</I>&gt;<i> our goal of making Chrome /the/ next generation object pascal compiler
</I>&gt;<i> for Mono, and a well-accepted part of the mono family.
</I>
I did not know that Chrome is so closely bundeled with Mono - but OTOH why 
doesn't mono ship with Chrome if it is considered to be the standard object 
pascal compiler for Mono? Or did I miss something here? Is there/Will there be a 
Chrome mode available in MonoDelevelop?
