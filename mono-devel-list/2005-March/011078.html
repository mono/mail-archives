<PRE>Hi Kelly,

They don't. Scripts can call C library functions, but
don't need to be be transferred during a library call.
Scripts can also register event handlers, but the
information about which events the script is waiting
for can be transferred as part of the script object.

&gt;<i> For instance, I assume threads are implemented as

</I>&gt;<i> object, of course) and you cannot possibly expect

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;persist&quot; these things unless the managed objects
</I>&gt;<i> specifically know how to do this (i.e. are designed
</I>&gt;<i> to support this functionality).
</I>
I agree. In order for this to work at all care has to
be taken that scripts can't get too entangled with the
server they are currently running on. As a note of
encouragement, this system currently works using
interpreted byte code. The text, stack and heap of the
script is contained within a single 16K blob which can
be shunted across to another server. The complication
with the proposed mono implementation is that the
stack, heap and text aren't so neatly packaged.

&gt;<i> Or am I missing the point?
</I>
No, I think your concerns are all valid.

Cheers,

Jim.
