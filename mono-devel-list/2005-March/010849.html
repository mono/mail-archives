<PRE>Hi guys,

There are some guys who send patches to module owners privately.
But I don't think it is good way to want them applied (I hope no
one would object ;-). Please post patches to mono-devel-list
so that everyone can review and/or point out some basic things
like &quot;check our coding convension&quot;, &quot;make sure not to break NUnit
tests&quot;, &quot;add ChangeLog&quot; etc.

There were not a few chances that the discussion on those patches
went complicated and/or long, and/or went in wrong direction,
and/or tried to doubt ECMA standard or MS.NET behavior sanity.
For the last case, nothing will happen if such discussion was
done only between the sender and the owner.

Love,
Atsushi Eno

</PRE>
