<PRE>I can offer a C# parser and lexer for Pascal as well. 
It is not in the perfect form for a compiler, as I was
using it for some other things, and it is not quite
complete (and won't be anytime soon).  However, it may
prove to be a decent starting point.

It is a recursive descent parser with a lexer that can
handle IFDEFs and such, except for the D5 and later
ones.

Let me know if you'd like me to send it (and to whom
to send it).  I don't currently have a web site
available to put it on, but I can give it to anyone
who would like to put it on theirs.  I also have no
license requirements for this code and am perfectly
willing to give it away to anyone who wants it.

</I>&gt;<i> While I have nothing against the Free Pascal guys, I

</I>&gt;<i> confident in this path.  It seems like their
</I>&gt;<i> compiler is trying to be 
</I>&gt;<i> compatible with every flavor of pascal out there and
</I>&gt;<i> almost making it. 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that we would be better off in picking just
</I>&gt;<i> one single 
</I>&gt;<i> (specific) language definition and working with it
</I>&gt;<i> exclusively.  Perhaps 
</I>&gt;<i> we could expand compatibility to other flavors of
</I>&gt;<i> pascal later, once we 
</I>&gt;<i> have an actual working implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  4.&gt; Take (g)mcs and make it understand Delphi
</I>&gt;<i> I would love to be able to leverage all of the
</I>&gt;<i> talent that has been used 
</I>&gt;<i> to make the mcs and gmcs compilers.  Even if we
</I>&gt;<i> could merge a new parser 
</I>&gt;<i> onto the gmcs back-end it would simplify the task
</I>&gt;<i> greatly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, the optimization work being done on the
</I>&gt;<i> gmcs compiler is a 
</I>&gt;<i> great attention getter for me.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3.&gt; has the nice benefit of the compiler being
</I>&gt;<i> self-hosted (?) - I mean 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the source of the compiler itself would be in
</I>&gt;<i> Pascal and a good unit 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; test. Drawback: We need a Delphi.NET command line
</I>&gt;<i> compiler for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bootstrapping during the first time (Perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> there's some free community 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; version?) and we'll have to introduce significant
</I>&gt;<i> modifications to the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; FPC code base.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4.&gt; Maybe some of the (g)mcs developers can help
</I>&gt;<i> us out here, explaining 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what would have to be done? But due to the
</I>&gt;<i> differences between C# and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Delphi chances are good that we have to modify the
</I>&gt;<i> used IR.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BTW: Theoretically we could even mix languages ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I guess we agree on a managed implementation..
</I>&gt;<i> True, I think that managed is the better choice.
