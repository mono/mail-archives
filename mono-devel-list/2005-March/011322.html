<PRE>Hi, I'm trying to get Mono and Microsoft's .Net Framework playing
nicely with each other with Remoting.  (For the most part, it works
remarkably well!)

There are a few issues with various types not being recognized by one
or the other.  (Mostly it seems that .Net isn't very consistent.)

I've filed a bug (#74295), including a potential patch, that appears
to correct the problems I've found so far - but I don't know enough
about how remoting is supposed to work to know if my fix even
approaches the Right Thing.

Here's the URL to the bug...

    <A HREF="http://bugs.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=74295">http://bugs.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=74295</A>

So my patch adds support for the XSD versions of the problem types to
the SoapTypeMapper class.  This works - though there is the issue
about it breaking compatibility with non-patched versions of Mono.  I
do have a fix that maintains compatibility, but it feels really
kludgy.  Let me know if you'd like to see it.

Now, there might be more issues than just the few I've discovered.
(I've searched a fair amount, but .Net's serializations seem so random
that I don't know if there's some weird condition I've missed.)
Should support just be added for *all* of the XSD types in the
SoapTypeMapper class?  Microsoft has a page showing XSD-&gt;.Net type
mappings...

    <A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconDataTypeSupportBetweenXSDTypesNETFrameworkTypes.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconDataTypeSupportBetweenXSDTypesNETFrameworkTypes.asp</A>

I'm happy to punch out a patch if it seems like adding all of those
mappings to SoapTypeMapper is the Right Thing to do.
