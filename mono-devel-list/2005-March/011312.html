I think everyone on the list is pretty accommodating.  No one's gonna 
get upset if you do something that people aren't used to.  :)

&gt;<i> I see a lot of messages both top and bottom quoted
</I>
And responses inline too.  Your preference.

&gt;<i> I see HTML messages etc.
</I>
I guess if people have a preference they prefer text only, but I don't 
remember anyone ever having serious issues with HTML.

 &gt; And actually what bothers me, is that in  the archives there are some
&gt;<i> messages, in which every line ends with &quot; =&quot;. What is this?
</I>
Has to do with the character encoding, I think.  Not sure what you might 
do about it.

&gt;<i> Also, what is the policy about replaying? To the list? Private? I
</I>&gt;<i> already posted a question and received both a private answer and
</I>&gt;<i> another one in the list. Do we have to keep the list volume low, and
</I>&gt;<i> skip some answers to the list?
</I>
Replies should generally go to the list so everyone can benefit from 
reading them.

Another thing that comes to mind is that if you send a patch, try to 
make sure your email app sends it as plain text.  On Windows you might 
have to associate the file extension with Notepad or something...  There 
are other general rules for sending patches, like always modify the 
appropriate ChangeLog and follow the Mono coding style (not that I 
always remember these), and send it to the whole list.
