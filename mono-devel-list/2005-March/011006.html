1)      If someone wants to write an open source Pascal compiler, they should do it. If it gets to an advanced enough state, and has the support needed, I see no reason why it could not be added to the Mono SVN; of course that is not my decision to make, but in the past similar projects such as Janet have been welcomed with open arms. Otherwise, it could also be put on sourceforge.
Be forewarned that it will take a lot of work, just getting a basic Pascal compiler should be easy, but supporting more complex things (attributes, security (CAS), interfaces, disposability/gc, modules, etc) may be very difficult. For Borland compatibility, other DLLS and namespaces will also need to be written.
Also many of the hard core Borland Pascal programmers I know have already made the move to C#.

2)      I have written a little bit about Chrome in my &#147;Monkey Business&#148; column, and I found out about them from this newsgroup. They have also made a lot of &#147;improvements,&#148; I especially like the &#147;design by contract&#148; additions. They are not the official Mono Pascal, nor could I ever see them becoming such. I appreciate the fact that they are spending time money and effort to be Mono compatible.

3)      I think giving away the command line compiler is cool and does eliminate *some* of the need for an open source Pascal compiler. Remember Microsoft gives away a command line C# compiler with the free .NET Framework. That did not stop Mono from writing their own C# compiler. If you really want to write a Pascal compiler, you should not let Chrome stop you.
