<PRE>Hi all,

I am (brand-)new to this list, so I am not replying to Willi's last e-mail...

Having read the whole thread about a free managed Pascal compiler I
want to share some thoughts on this. If there is already a different
place to post mails to (Willi?) I apologize for this.

So here it goes...
A colleague at the research center where I work as a grad student has
worked the past 1-2 years on a Object Pascal front end (parser +
semantic analyzer) for a re-engineering tool. He has been using the
ANTLR parser generator (www.antlr.org) which generates recursive
descent parsers and has also a very good scanner generator, so you can
easily deal with the &quot;..&quot; in (array) ranges and other things that
might be more complicated in other parser generators. ANTLR also
supports syntactical and predicated look-ahead which makes it possible
to specify a grammar that is stricly seen no LL(k) grammar. My
colleague has been implementing in Java but ANTLR can also generate
parsers in C#, so his grammar spec file should be almost completely
reusable for a C# implementation.
Although I have access to our (internal) CVS repository I need to make
sure it is open source, first.

As I have some experience in writing parser generators with ANTLR I
can only recommend it, there is almost no loss in flexibility compared
to a hand-written recursive descent parser. I even used ANTLR to
manually call (!) selected productions in the generated parser! ANTLR
also supports building abstract syntax trees (similar to JJTree of
JavaCC) but I haven't tried that, yet.

Philipp
