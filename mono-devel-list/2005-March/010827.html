<PRE>Its not easy :-) Before I had Paco's CD, when I first started, I built
my entire build from scratch. It took me over 1 1/2 months to get every
last part of Mono built. That includes mono, mcs, GTK#, and tons more.
It also includes all the WIN32 dependencies, package config hacks,
environment variable changes, and so much more. My builds are still far
from being anything Paco's as well, with mine being built with the
latest official version of MinGW, and not the one included with Cygwin
which is much older and hacked to run with the &quot;gcc -mno-cygwin&quot; under
the cygwin. Even with Paco's cd, building mono, especially if you want
update all the time and keep building, can quickly become a huge chore
and pain. Only if you plan on building it to help patching the mono
runtime itself, or need a feature that just came out, I would just wait
until the next release. 

Now that doesn't exclude GTK# and maybe even MCS sometimes. The runtime
isn't usually going to break at this point with new classes on top of
it. The worst I have seen is a few classes that might stop working, but
usually grabbing a recharge package from <A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/daily/">http://www.go-mono.com/daily/</A>
will get you running again if you trying to stay up to date.

Hope that helps :-)
