<PRE>Hi!

To bring this discussion to an end: We'll neither change the world nor making an 
impact in the world; We don't know if we'll ever reach our goal or even if we'll 
create something useful - BUT we do think positive and because it's a fun 
project we can cut our teeth on, we'll start planing some GPLed (largely) 
Delphi.NET compatible managed compiler for Mono (in C#). Maybe we'll support 
other syntax extensions too, but that's not the initial goal.

The 'how','what' and 'when' parts still need to be decided (some probably next 
week); Of course we won't do this on the mono-devel list, but we'll report back 
here.

Some final remarks: While I agree that C# is the next-big-thing, the only 
feeling I have about C#'s constructors is I /hate/ them. Furthermore this will 
be a spare-time project (at least on my part) so no financial interest there. 
The good thing about .NET is that we'll be able to use all the tons of C# code 
written for it and the nice mono framework...
And at last: If there is some open source managed VB compiler, there simply has 
to be a Delphi one ;-)

regards,
Willi
