<PRE>Hello,

</I>&gt;<i> BTW, You can use partial classes for really ugly constructs.
</I>
Hmm, then I think we have fifty-fifty game here. I don't think I
can convince you and vice versa.

It also means other points of view are welcome.

&gt;&gt;<i> If those warning output REALLY annoys developers, I'd just add
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /nowarn:169 as well as 162, 612 and 618.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure whether every developer is annoyed by these warnings.
</I>
I wonder what is the actual need to fix warnings then.

&gt;&gt;<i> Well, aside this code, there is possibility that those extra fields
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might be used from other assemblies. For example, I used to have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> XQueryCommandImpl type and field in System.Xml.dll and referenced it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from System.Data.SqlXml.dll via reflection.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK, then please declare this field/method as internal. It is easier to 
</I>&gt;<i> see that the field is hacked from outside.
</I>
I can easily do that, but I don't understand why we have to change
a member's access modifier just for avoiding warnings (I don't think
the difference between private and internal is for such intent).

&gt;&gt;<i> Please don't send me but post it to the mail list so that everyone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can have a chance to try.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Only System.XML and System.Web have problem is so many warnings. The 
</I>&gt;<i> rest of
</I>&gt;<i> assemblies is OK. So, I addressed only you and Gonzalo.
</I>
I think the reason why we have such a lot of warnings only in those
assemblies is because we have large part of NET_2_0 implementation
(rather than just a stub) mainly in sys.xml and sys.web. That's part
of why I think your patch matters for otheres, not only for Gonzalo,
Lluis and me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But csc is really not good in this area. They made some improvement 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> for 2.0. But even
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> simple cases are still not detected.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, csc 2.0 seems added some additional code analysis. But I doubt
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if the remaining check is &quot;better&quot;. It sounds like design principle
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> difference.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it is bug, consider this
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> class X {
</I>&gt;<i>    int x;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    public X (int x)
</I>&gt;<i>    {
</I>&gt;<i>        this.x = x;
</I>&gt;<i>    }
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any of csc 1.x, 2.0 versions don't report warning for this code.
</I>&gt;<i> But mcs reports: warning CS0169: The private field 'X.x' is never used
</I>&gt;<i> And I think it is 100% correct.
</I>
Well, for this case it looks fine (maybe it should be like &quot;X.x
is assigned but never used&quot; though).
