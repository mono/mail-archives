<PRE>Hi everybody,
         I am new to this developer list. I have done
something using mono. I have developed a web Service
using C# language in Dot Net platform that invokes
matlab and executes decesion support tool(actually it
does power system optimization) that is developed in
matlab , and then gets back the result from matlab. I
have developed an asp.net web page that connects to MS
access database and reads data from three tables in MS
access, displays all the data in datagrid ,and creates
three jagged array reading data from these tables in
database, which it actually sends to Web service and
Service sends back the result(that is the optimized
result)to client.I have developed both of these in
Visual Studio.Net and deployed on IIS web server. I
can develope the web service in Linux and deploy it on
 xsp web server in linux , but the decesion support
tool,already developed in matlab, is calling methods
from a dll .So it will not run in Linux . For that
reason I have not tried to deploy the web service in
linux. I have developed an asp.net Web page (in C#
language) that reads data from three text files (Here
each text file corresponds to a data table in MS
access) and deployed on xsp Web  Server in Linux and
it displays all the data in datagrid and then creates
three jagged arrays reading from text files ,send the
array to the Web Service deployed on IIS and getbacks
the result that it displays on listboxes. Now if I try
to connects to MS access database from C# program in
linux i am facing problem .Please give me advice .At
the end I want to say that it is much more easier to
develope web service        using mono in linux or
VS.net in Windows than java Web Service using Java Web
Service Developer pack. One limitation of java Web
Service is that if Client program try to send some
multi dimensional array to web service it can
not,instead it need to transform multidimensional
array into one dimensional,because SOAP does not
support multidimensional array and it support jagged
array. Since C# support jagged array ,so  client can
send any multidimensional array through jagged array
to Web Service in C# and get back the same through
jagged array.
