Marc, there will always be people interested in a free (as in
speech) compiler, a gratis one simply does not fit their needs.
And this is not just idealism, often it is pragmatism: being
allowed to fix the thing on you own, independently of the vendor's
priorities, is a thing of great value. Great enough to make you
join the effort ow writing a free compiler.

The promises of the vendor, even if sincere, are not enough for
many, that's it: one thing is a promise, another thing is having
the source code yourself!

So, while everybody here respects your business interests and
your business model, since you are obviously not making money on
the command line compiler (it is already gratis), why not opening
its source code?
I guess you'd receive much more than what you'd have given in the
long run, but I'm not a business man so I stop here.

Anyway, keep in mind that I suggested to open the code of the
command line compiler only, which seems to be gratis anyway so
it should not be a source of revenue for you.

Ciao,
  Massi
