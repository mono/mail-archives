<PRE>There's not a single answer.

Sometimes we just let the problem in 'nativeland',  either by
duplicating some windows native library outside windows (libgdiplus.so
is our version of gdiplus.dll for use in System.Drawing), or having
multiple platform-dependent versions (GTK for X and for Windows) just
wrapped needing at most some p/invoke remapping in the dll config file
(mono specific extension).

Sometimes  we have some (kept to the possible minimun) run time
checking for platform to choose code paths (p/invokes are resolved
only at first-call).

And sometimes (mainly in the makefiles) we use some defines or
specific targets/rules, so that some things aren't built or are
differently built according to the target platform.

One of the trickiest parts in developing for multiple platforms are
the mass of unit tests, and we have thouroughly used Nunit's support
for categories to be able to keep the situation manageable.

Well I may not give any better hope, but I hope it helps.

As for your Idea with attributes, we just have the p/invoke remapping,
but nothing with a conditional behaviour...

Fun, :)
