This is at best your misinformed opinion.
If by 'official support' you mean that someone has an idea on a list
and the mono team has to implement it, then yes, there is no official
support.
We support as best as we can any program that targets mono, very much so
if it's free software, since we can more easily see how a bug is triggered
and reproduce it more easily as well.
I also personally bugged several different OSS compiler writers that target
the CLI to provide us with feedback and their test suites so we can fix any
bug in mono that is triggered by their peculiar uses of the runtime.

As it is it's hard for us to provide any support for an open source compiler
that doesn't exist. Write the code and if it triggers issues in mono we'll
fix them.

&gt;<i> 3) Opposition from commercial interests exists
</I>
Why should you care about someone else's commercial interests?
Write the code instead of making up excuses: you'll spend your time
in a better way.
