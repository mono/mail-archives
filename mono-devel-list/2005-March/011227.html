Can you try that desc-heap thing I described? Having somebody take an
initial look at that would really help me.

If Sqlite is leaking, you might want to file a bug, or see if it is your
own fault. 

&gt;<i> While we are on the subject I noticed that I was not able to determine 
</I>&gt;<i> amount of memory used by my process from the process itself using the

</I>&gt;<i> System.Diagnostics.Process.GetCurrentProcess().WorkingSet/(1024*1024);
</I>&gt;<i>         }
</I>
Maybe it makes sense to use RSS for that. Do people have any thoughts?

(This would also be for S.Environment.WorkingSet, which is a much easier
way to get what you want).
