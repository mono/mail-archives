<PRE>&quot;  Only Miguel or a Novell official can speak about Mono and patents.  &quot;

I probably I misinterpreted this: why isn't anyone free to speak about
Mono and patents?
Mono is GPL'd -- why would a &quot;Novell official&quot; be in a better position
than anyone else?

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1)      Only Miguel or a Novell official can speak about Mono and patents. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2)      All patents needed to produce a version of ECMA .NET are RAND
</I>&gt;<i> (Reasonable and non-discriminatory). It seemed at one time Red Hat was
</I>&gt;<i> concerned about how reasonable the terms might be. I think the agreement
</I>&gt;<i> with HP combined with the non-discriminatory terms kills this argument.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore I think anyone can duplicate ECMA .NET without patent problems
</I>&gt;<i> related to .NET 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3)      I think patents not related to .NET could still be a problem. For
</I>&gt;<i> instance my understanding is that MS has some patents related the &quot;SendAPI&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> where when a file is sent over the network, the network and file system use
</I>&gt;<i> the same kernel buffer. In the old days, I guess the file was copied to a
</I>&gt;<i> user buffer first, consuming a lot of time. This is just an example, so it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't matter if I am wrong here. The point is that is MS held such a
</I>&gt;<i> patent, it would not be required for ECMA .NET, so not covered by the RAND
</I>&gt;<i> agreement. If Mono used the patented technique it would not be protected by
</I>&gt;<i> the ECMA agreement.
</I>&gt;<i> This is a basic problem with software patents; almost any program beyond
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;hello w orld&quot; will violate somebody's patents. I do not think this level of
</I>&gt;<i> patents is what bothers Red Hat. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4)      Not all of .NET is part of the ECMA standard. System.Windows.Forms,
</I>&gt;<i> System.Data, and VB.NET are major pieces not included in the ECMA standard,
</I>&gt;<i> MS has never given anyone permission to use these patents, but have said
</I>&gt;<i> they are open to negations. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5)      I far as I know, MS has NO patents on .NET. they applied for a
</I>&gt;<i> patent that covered the entire namespace two years ago, as far as I know,
</I>&gt;<i> that patent is still pending. This does not include patents that are not
</I>&gt;<i> part of .NET, but that coul dbe used to implement .NET (see #3) 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 6)      See point #1.
