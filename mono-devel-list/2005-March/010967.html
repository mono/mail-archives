<PRE>&gt;<i> I have no interest in either pascal, delphi, or any of this, but for
</I>&gt;<i> what it is worth the Chrome guys have been around for a while. They have
</I>&gt;<i> spoken to me about MonoDevelop integration, and have posted many times
</I>&gt;<i> on this mailing list.
</I>
I'm not that new to the list, but it never ocurred to me that mono does have an 
official Pascal compiler and it was Chrome. Many companies are posting to this 
list about their products, but honestly I don't remember one of RemObjects 
stating that the mono-pascal compiler was available for download anywhere..
(And why it's not in svn if it's an integral part of mono??)

Note: Saying Chorme is ready doesn't ring a bell if you a.) don't know what 
Chrome is and b.) that Miguel decided to use it as standard Pascal compiler for 
mono.

  One of the guys hangs out in #mono very frequently
&gt;<i> too, so as far as 'not telling the mono community', I don't think that
</I>&gt;<i> is accurate in the least.
</I>
How do you guys manage to get some work done while at the same time hanging 
around in #mono? I can not do that, so I do not monitor #mono.
