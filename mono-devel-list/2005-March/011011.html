<PRE>Why?

Who uses Pascal anymore?

Hasn't everyone (that's serious) moved on to C++, Java and/or C#?

Are there jobs in Pascal anymore?

It makes little sense to hack up something such as a Pascal compiler (no small task, btw) if no
one except the three people working on it will use it--or care if it exists.  If someone has
academic interests I would say go for it; but for those of you who need to pay bills I would
say--this is a bad idea--your wives will be leaving you for C# programmers who get paid, or who
after graduation have jobs waiting for them.

This sounds exactly like something I would have posted back in college; then came graduation and
then paying my own bills.  Suddenly, all of those eclectic (non-paying) languages that I dreamed
about in college ceased to matter--Pascal being one of them.  Yes, yes, I can hear the Delphi
crowd--in the commercial space--Delphi is dead, in ten years no one is going to remember Delphi.

Pascal is definitely a great language; I suggest; however, that if you want to make an impact that
you find something to do with your time (and hard work) that will live after you are tired of
working on it.  There are ``plenty'' of green untouched areas to help with on the Mono project; I
suggest you try your hand at something that won't be quickly thrown away but will rather stand the
test of time.  C# (love it--or--hate it) is MS' baby, and they will force it down our throats, C#
will, by force, have a future.

Instead of Pascal, you might try hacking F#, a .NET Ocaml knock off, it should have a more
promising future than Pascal/.net and you might get eventually get paid.
