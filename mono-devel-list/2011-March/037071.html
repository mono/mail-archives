<PRE>Hi Guys!
I am looking for a way to contribute to the WPF implementation. The issue is
that I have to do it on company time and convince them that it would be good
for them. So I did try the Mono Migration Analyzer on latest stable version
and it gave me a nice report that the scared our executives too much :D, but
I thought I could make it a little less scary if I tried checking it against
the latest changes from the Olive branch.  
No other alternatives are available for me, because they only &quot;business&quot;
option is rewriting the GUI from scratch and I cant convince them otherwise.
So here is the deal, I was not very successful in building the Olive branch
yet, but I need to give the report next Monday, can someone offer any ideas
on building it, as the readme has not been extremal helpful or maybe even
can give me the binaries for checking (not stable but at least usable on
MMA). 
Dissuading from using this path is not really necessary, unless you can tell
me that there is nothing useful in there or even build-able. Unfortunately
then I wont be able to work on this project much :(
Regards,
Ignas (Breakable)
