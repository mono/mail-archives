<PRE>I think you are misunderstanding the state of the &quot;WPF implementation&quot;.

It is basically non-existant.  Although there are some classes that have 
been stubbed out, very little has been implemented.

For example, look at everything that throws NotImplementedException in 
UIElement.cs:

<A HREF="https://github.com/mono/olive/blob/master/class/PresentationCore/System.Windows/UIElement.cs">https://github.com/mono/olive/blob/master/class/PresentationCore/System.Windows/UIElement.cs</A>

I doubt it even will display an empty window, much less have any 
controls implemented.

Based on the time we spent on WinForms (~10 people x ~4+ years, + 
contributions), a complete-ish WPF implementation is probably at least 
100,000 man hours away.
