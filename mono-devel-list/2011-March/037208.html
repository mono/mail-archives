&gt;<i> Dear&#160;Team Mono,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am very excited to contribute in open source community through the

</I>&gt;<i> of&#160;&#8220;Mono&#8221; at <A HREF="http://mono-project.com/Gsoc">http://mono-project.com/Gsoc</A> and have seen project ideas for
</I>&gt;<i> GSoC 2011. I am interested in two projects. The reason for my interest is
</I>&gt;<i> that I have previously worked on .NET related projects both in VB and C# and
</I>&gt;<i> want to develop skills of IDE development.&#160;I am writing you to let you know
</I>&gt;<i> my understanding of the project&#160;and required knowledge of technologies. I
</I>&gt;<i> would like your feedback on it.&#160;My understanding of the requirements is as
</I>&gt;<i> follows:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;Debugger Visualizer&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.&#160;&#160;Implement a debugger visualizer (Can &#8220;Debugger Visualizer&#8221; template from
</I>&gt;<i> .NET framework be used?)
</I>
There is no debugger visualizer infrastructure in .NET, only VS, and
MD doesn't implement the VS API. MD has its own visualizer
infrastructure.

&gt;<i> 2.&#160;&#160;A DataType assembly will be loaded into the debugger visualizer at
</I>&gt;<i> runtime and display the desired properties in a presentable form.
</I>
That sounds like more like the DebuggerTypeProxy. That's also a
possible GSoC project, but would have to take place in the Mono
framework, not the MonoDevelop IDE.

&gt;<i> 3.&#160;&#160;I need to specify which visualizers are to be implemented.
</I>
Yes, this is only an idea for a GSoC project. You would have to define
a project that is big enough for the GSoC period, and it can consist
of several smaller tasks, such as a number of different visualizers,
or you could find other debugger enhancements and combine them into
the project. You'd need to describe what visualizers you want to
create, explain why they're useful, and so on.

&gt;<i> &#8220;Translation Resources Editor&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Implement an editor for different language resources to help people edit
</I>&gt;<i> resources files without modifying XML files directly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. The program should load strings from .resx file and provide an interface
</I>&gt;<i> to enter the required translations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, it says &quot;Should extend or share code with the Gettext addin.&quot; I am not
</I>&gt;<i> quite sure about this at the moment. Does it mean that this Resource Editor
</I>&gt;<i> is required to be integrated with Gettext? Any help is appreciated in this
</I>&gt;<i> regard.
</I>
MonoDevelop already has a &quot;Translation&quot; addin, which has a GUI for
editing Gettext translation catalogs. The idea here is that the resx
translation editor would be able to re-use some of the code
(particularly some of the GUI) from the Gettext addin.
