</I>Patch looks good except for the missing cleanup on shutdown. The way is to
hook it up on _wapi_cleanup.

Signal delivery is never reliable. You patch will probably behave even worse
on osx which doesn't implement posix real time extensions.

The worst part is that to do this reliably, one can only depend on OS
specific
features.

On linux use signalfd with a thread doing a blocking read on it. On OSX you
need to use mach primitives. Other posix-based systems with suck with the
signal version until patches are submitted.
