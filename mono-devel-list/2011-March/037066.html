<PRE>Hi!

I'm currently getting ready to apply as a student for GSoC 2011 and
particularly found an interest in your organization. First of all I'd like
to know if the MonoProject is going to participate for GSoC, this time also.
I've done some open source development work with another project. But I'm
interested in expanding that contribution in hopes of gathering more
experience. Also I'm currently in the process of covering the C# language.
C# is not entirely new to me because I'm reasonably familiar with C, C++ and
Java and I find adapting to C# is not that difficult because of my
familiarities with other Object Oriented languages.So principally I hope
that contributing to this project will help me to put to use what I'm
currently covering to a great extent.
I'm familiar with C, C++, Java and a little bit of python. also I'm more
comfortable developing in the Windows platform. Is development in Windows
possible for Mono?
And what can I do to get more familiar with the Monoproject? What facets
should I look into? How should I prepare?
And what are the other prerequisite skills that I'd have to prepare if I am
to develop for Mono?

Thanks!
