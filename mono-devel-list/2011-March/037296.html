We're always interested in new ideas! You should post your idea on the
mailing list and ask for feedback. Don't just say &quot;I want to work on
X&quot;, be more specific, tell us what you want to do, think about how
you'd do it, sell your idea to us and get us excited about it!

That doesn't mean you have to decide now which one to do. We've
already had several different proposals submitted by one student, it's
not a problem. We evaluate them and talk to you to figure out which
one is best.


&gt;<i> For Applying in the same organization for different projects,i have to use

</I>&gt;<i> waiting for a quick response...
</I>
It's always one application per project. A soc proposal is for
describing a project so we can evaluate it, so don't make it multiple
choice :)
