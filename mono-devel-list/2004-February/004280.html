<PRE>Greetings folks,

Here is a patch to provide windows registry support
for mono.

The patch uses the win32 API to manipulate the
registry. Obviously this is not very useful on Linux.
Is there registry support available in WINE?

The patch includes some 50-odd unit tests. They run on
windows/.NET, and they run on Windows/Mono.

Recommendation for using the tests:
 - Create a dummy account on your system.
 - Run the tests from within that account. The tests
almost all use the HKEY_CURRENT_USER, and thus any
registry damage which could occur can be dismissed by
deleting the account.
 - A configuration file is used by the tests to define
what registry keys are safe for use in testing. Make
sure that this file has the same name as the unit test
DLL. 
 - When the tests are started, the test constructors
check for the existence of the registry keys it will
use. If these keys exist the test constructor throws
an exception to prevent possible damage to you
registry. If your system configuration would be
adversly affected by these tests, change the settings
to some safe values.
 - I've run these tests without any adverse effects on
my system, and don&#146;t bother to create a separate
account any more. Having said all that, I'm sure its
not foolproof. Be careful.


Features:
    - basic open/create/delete keys
    - get sub keys
    - delete sub trees
    - get/set values
    
What is not included in this
    - Not all the possible exceptions are being
generated, I have not exhaustively mapped them all
out.
    - OpenRemoteBaseKey


comments welcome,
regards,
Erik
