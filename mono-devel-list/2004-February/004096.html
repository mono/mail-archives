Yes, the winelib that Mono used was &quot;re-jigged&quot; so that it could be
loaded through &quot;normal&quot; means (dlopen(3)).  By default, Wine likes/needs
to be in charge of loading libraries, as Windows makes several
guarantees about DLL loading that Unix shared libraries don't.  (For
example, Windows ensures that all DLLs get notified when a thread is
created and destroyed, among other things.)

The last time I remember seeing this come up on Wine Traffic, the
consensus was that Wine would likely never officially support the
loading of Wine libraries through non-Wine means, though this may have
changed since then.  You can find the archives here:
