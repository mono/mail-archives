I forgot to mention this, but in C++ the static member would also need
to be declared as &quot;volatile&quot; for double-checked locking to properly
work, IIRC.

The problem is that the code (double-checked locking) *does* work.  On
x86.  And probably numerous other platforms.  But it's not *guaranteed*
to work on *all* platforms.  That's the problem.

See: <A HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/cbrumme/archive/2003/05/17/51445.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/cbrumme/archive/2003/05/17/51445.aspx</A>

To quote (liberally) from Chris Brumme's blog:

	if (a == null)
	{
		lock(obj)
		{
			if (a == null) a = new  A();
		}
	}

	....

        However,  we have to assume that a series of stores have taken
        place during construction  of &#8216;a&#8217;.  Those stores can be 
        arbitrarily reordered, including the possibility of delaying
        them until after  the publishing store which assigns the new
        object to &#8216;a&#8217;.  At that point, there is a small window before
        the store.release implied by leaving the lock.  Inside that
        window, other CPUs can navigate through the reference &#8216;a&#8217; and
        see a partially constructed  instance.
        
In other words, &quot;Oops,&quot; because the memory model is (1) weaker than
developers expect, and (2) not reproducible on commodity hardware.

&gt;<i> and btw.  is reading or writing a native/simple/non-object ( i don't
</I>&gt;<i> know the exact term for this. i mean something like int, char and so on)
</I>&gt;<i> an atomic operation?
</I>
It's atomic if the object's size is less than a machine word.  So Int32
can be assumed to be read atomically on all platforms, but Int64 can not
(it'll be atomic on 64-bit platforms, but not in 32-bit x86).

Though, strictly speaking, this is machine/hardware/architecture
dependent.  You probably wouldn't want to assume this, but it's a fairly
reasonable assumption for most platforms.

&gt;<i> for example if i have two threads, one writes to a variable randomly 1
</I>&gt;<i> or 10. the other thread reads the variable in a loop and writes it to
</I>&gt;<i> the screen. can i be sure that i will only see the numbers 1 and 10? 
</I>
For all platforms I know of, yes.  But I don't know of all possible
platforms, and there's a potentially infinite number of future
platforms, so this isn't guaranteed to be true.  It will *probably* be
true, because if it weren't, a whole number of potential software
optimizations becomes difficult, but it's not a sure thing.
