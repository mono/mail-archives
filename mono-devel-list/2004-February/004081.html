<PRE>&gt;<i> As a side note, what do you need to test the existance of a framework
</I>&gt;<i> for? The only use I am able to see for this is the ignorring of a test
</I>&gt;<i> that fails on a specific framework due to a bug. I would really rather
</I>&gt;<i> see this implemented with [KnownFailure] sort of thing. The
</I>&gt;<i> [KnownFailure] concept actually has alot of use in other contexts (eg,
</I>&gt;<i> known not to work until the blah team finishes foo feature).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Really, the only reason to test for a framework should be if you are
</I>&gt;<i> integrating with it (for example, a profiling tool that makes custom
</I>&gt;<i> calls for each fx). If that is not a case, it would be better to have a
</I>&gt;<i> bug filed in our bugzilla and an annotation made to the test case.
</I>
If it's the case that there's an actual bug which might be fixed in short
order, I'd leave that test in place and ignore it. But if it's a case that a
feature has not been developed and won't be developed for a while - or
possibly never - then I think I'd decide to provide the functionality
through some other means. A good example of this is porting to the compact
framework where you don't get .NET remoting and some parts of Reflection are
missing &quot;by design&quot;.
