<PRE>Did I really say I could get iterators working in operators and properties?  
Perhaps I was a little optimistic, as they say.  I will continue to 
investigate but I'm not making any more rash promises.  This looks like a low 
priority problem as it can be easily worked around by implementing the 
iterator (ie using the yield keyword) in a normal method and calling that 
from the operator/property, so I may be able to come up with something before 
someone who knows what they're doing has time to look at this.

I have found where the error comes from (csparser.jay) and why 
(iterator_container is not set when entering a operator / getter), but I 
havent yet found out whether changes are necessary in other places, and I 
don't really understand jay.

I have filed a bug for this problem (#54902)
