<PRE>Ben,

Following the particular theory of testing you describe, you would
definitely not have a need for this feature. But some people follow
other approaches. For example, I like to do TDD and to only write unit
tests insofar as they are needed to drive the design. After that, I
focus on acceptance tests. But other folks continue to work at the unit
test level until they have full &quot;coverage&quot; - in whatever sense it
matters to them. I could discuss this at greater length, but I'm afraid
that it's not particularly on topic here.

Open software like Nunit - or Mono for that matter - needs to satisfy
the people who use it. Arguments like &quot;Nobody should want this&quot;
generally lose out in the face of folks who actually have a use for a
feature, particlarly if one of them is prepared to implement it.

</I>&gt;<i> particulary 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; TDD, this may not make sense. However, a large part of the

</I>&gt;<i> shouldnt go about probing the storage format of your settings.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Tests really shouldnt assert things about how the code looks inside.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can see the argument here in a setup where, say, you could 
</I>&gt;<i> use a MySQL db or a MSSQL db and were expected to interop 
</I>&gt;<i> with other programs. However, I think that the best way to do 
</I>&gt;<i> this case is just to build seperate assemblies for each 
</I>&gt;<i> provider and only run the tests on platforms where the 
</I>&gt;<i> provider is supported. However, you dont need to change NUnit 
</I>&gt;<i> to support this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Your thoughts on known failures are interesting. It had not 
</I>&gt;<i> occurred 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to me that there may be a difference between something that doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work on a platform - and never will - and something that is 
</I>&gt;<i> expected 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (hoped?) to work some time in the future. For some projects, the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; distinction is not important but it probably is for others. 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll have 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to think on that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, I am not thinking of this in terms of platforms, I 
</I>&gt;<i> am talking about known failures in general. I really dont 
</I>&gt;<i> like [Ignore] because it makes you *not* run the test.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You could extend this to allowing the decleration of groups by saying:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [Group (&quot;FILED_BUGS&quot;)]
</I>&gt;<i> [Note (&quot;see bug#12345&quot;]
</I>&gt;<i> ..
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And then run on the command line like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> nunit /ignore-group:FILED_BUGS
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> or you could do:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> nunit /known-fail:FILED_BUGS
</I>&gt;<i> (so maybe you would get a gold star or something if one of 
</I>&gt;<i> the known failures was made green ;-).
