<PRE>Hi,

I worked a little bit on a fully managed implementation for the char class.

Its features are now:
- completely standalone (uses no internalcalls)
- extremely fast (about 250% to up to 1000% faster than Mono AND MS impl.)
- eats LOADS of memory

and thats also the problem... How much memory usage might be acceptable? Is
this class used a lot in the Mono Framework (I think I've seen it in
System.XML impls), but is that speed really neccessary?
Also I can't compile mono on my machine. Perhaps somebody could do that and
then try to run some apps to see what effects it has.
What would especially be interresting (I have no knowledge at all about the
mono runtime) - are we going to save any memory by no longer using the
internalcalls (I would assume these need to get their data from somewhere,
too ;)

Andreas
