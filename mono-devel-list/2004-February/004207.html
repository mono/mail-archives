<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> I've explored GTK and I saw that drawing in Gtk.DrawingArea involves using 
</I>&gt;<i> Gdk.Drawable which in turn requires learning some of Pango (?)... I guess 
</I>&gt;<i> Pango implements what I think it is the functionality of System.Drawing, no?
</I>
Gdk implements the drawing primitives, it is fairly low-level.

Pango is a text-setting facility that you can use to render.

&gt;<i> Now, I'am confused what library I should use to &quot;draw&quot;...
</I>&gt;<i> Should I use System.Windows.Forms (with Mono-wine or something?) or should I 
</I>&gt;<i> use GTK and use that Pango thing?
</I>
Gdk for now.  I have a patch that lets you use Cairo (it was posted to
the gtk-sharp-list) to draw, which is simpler to use than Gdk.

In the future we will integrate System.Drawing and/or Cairo into Gtk# so
it will be a familiar API.

&gt;<i> I dont know what is being made in this direction so I dont know what to do....
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another question is what should I use to do image manipulation (resize, 
</I>&gt;<i> chopping, do thumbnails, etc) in a server (in ASP.NET for example) without 
</I>&gt;<i> installing the whole X package ?
</I>
Work is underway to have a complete System.Drawing implementation.  CVS
should let you do this.

Miguel.
