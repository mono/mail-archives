<PRE>&gt;<i> Does we have some way of smartly link only used pieces of code, like what 
</I>&gt;<i> the following product does?
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
No, it pulls everything in.

Notice that the above linker is good, but not perfect.  

&gt;<i> I see it as having negative aspects when dealing with programs that revolve 
</I>&gt;<i> around the plugin pattern (pieces glued by configuration files at run-time).
</I>
For exactly this reason ;-)

&gt;<i> But as pointed out by some people (mainly developers for 
</I>&gt;<i> download-and-try-before-you-buy software), forcing people to first install a 
</I>&gt;<i> (big) runtime to be able to run some software they are interested to try 
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes makes those people lose the interest.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does we have plans to do some tool like that?
</I>
I do not have plans, this sounds like a perfect space for a small ISV
to offer a solution (and be responsible for the support ;-), but you
could use some free available tools to construct such a thing.

There is a PE-file manipulation library that can do this and more that
was posted to the Rotor mailing lists a few weeks ago.

Miguel.
