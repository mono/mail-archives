<PRE>Hi All.  
 
I'm new to the list, fairly new to mono, and definitely a newbie when it
comes to porting.  I'm an expert J2EE developer, intermediate .NET
developer, and rusty C developer.  Lately, I've been working primarily in
the embedded C arena, and would love to be able to port mono to a target
platform.   I'm not necessarily interested in a JIT runtime compiler, but
rather just interested in having the ability to compile c# to a native
application.   
 
Before I head down this path, I just wanted to know whether or not it would
be possible.  What is the minimum system requirements for porting mono?  I'm
looking for a recommendation (yeah or nah) given the following specs (and
given your experiences):
 
- 166 MHz (MIPS) 32 bit RISC Processor
- 16 Mb DRAM
- 4 Mb Graphic Dram
- 4 Mb Flash EPROM
 
If possible can someone give me an idea about the level of difficulty and
time estimate (minus the reading - which I know is substantial.  btw. I have
a comp. eng. background, with hardware, assembly lang, os dev, experience)
 
Thanks in advance for any advice...
- Mike Stanley
 
P.S.  Out of curiosity has anyone attempted to port mono to the new TI
and/or ARM based Palm OS devices?
