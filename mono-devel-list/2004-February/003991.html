<PRE>I have a object pool that holds database connections which I would like
other programs to make use of.  So a common example would be a a client
application making a soap request to a server which grabs a connection
from the pool to run its queries.  While this first request is still
being processed, another person via soap request some other information
from the server, which grabs another connection from the pool.  Since
these request seem like a start and stop of a process, does the
connection pool get re-instantiated with each request?  So if I hit the
server, does it turn on the pool and then turn it off at the end of my
request, subsequently doing that each time a user hits hits a page?  If
so, is there a way that I can make the pool stay open between requests
so that it can appropriately pass off connections for use (which seems
like the best way - so you do not have to continually start and stop
database connections).

How would something like this be done in C#/.NET?  Is it a way I compile
a .dll or does it have to do with the way XSP/Apache/IIS service a
request?

Thanks advance,

~ Matthew
