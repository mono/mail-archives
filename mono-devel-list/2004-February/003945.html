</I>I agree with your thoughts. I think it is good idea to mark GDIPlus as
internal class. Also, I'm concerned about the size of gdipFunctions.cs
(pointed out by you in other mail). We need to do something about it. In
my opinion, this class can be used to house the commonly used functions
and we should have separate internal classes to house internal static
wrapper methods used by each and every class of S.D. However, I'm OK to
house static wrapper methods used by abstract classes in there.
