But according to section 1.9, paragraphs 1 and 6, the compiler is
allowed to move non-volatile reads and writes up or down past volatile
reads or writes.  I don't think paragraph 11 is relevant; we're
discussing volatile pointers to non-volatile objects, not volatile
objects.

And no amount of &quot;volatile&quot; will help, unless the compiler surrounds
accesses to volatiles with memory barriers (a memory barrier is a
special instruction which guarantees that modifications to memory made
by one processor are visible to another processor).  My guess is that
most compilers do not automatically emit memory barriers for volatile
accesses (for instance, in a quick check through the Alpha code
generator in the gcc 2.95.3 source tree I happened to have lying about,
I didn't see any evidence that it used memory barriers for anything
besides synchronizing data and instruction caches on a single
processor).

I recommend reading:
