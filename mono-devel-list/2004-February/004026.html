<PRE>This is not meant to be a criticism of Ben personally, but I see this so
often that someone must be teaching this somewhere or it has been
ingrained from other people constantly using it, especially on Slashdot.
Frankly I am about to _lose_ it!

There seems a tendency for people to mix up _lose_ and _loose_, which
mean completely different things.  Normally, since English as a language
is quite _loose_, I can usually forgive this, especially on the internet
as English is not everyone's first language. However, for (I assume)
quite intelligent people, getting this wrong should not be a daily
occurrence!

Thank you for reading if you have got this far and go nuts on my grammar
if you wish since I'm being a word nazi! :))

Cheers,
Chris
