&gt;<i>  Hola,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Right now, the GDIPlus class in gdipFunction.cs is marked as public.
</I>&gt;<i>  Is there a reason for that? Do we need to expose anything public that
</I>&gt;<i>  is in that class? It seems like its main use is a storage container
</I>&gt;<i>  for internal static wrapper methods to hook onto P/Invoke. If there
</I>&gt;<i>  is a need for some method in that class, would it make sense to keep
</I>&gt;<i>  GDIPlus only for the P/Invoke functions and create a new class to
</I>&gt;<i>  house those other methods?
</I>
Hola Duncan,

They should be internal. Also, System.Windows.Forms.Win32_WineLess and
System.Windows.Forms.Win32 and any other class that encapsulates
internal implementations should be internal also.

I do not see any reason to keep them public.

Jordi,
