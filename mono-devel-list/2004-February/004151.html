I heard somewhere that GC in MS .NET have some special optimization for
dealing with short lived objects.

However mono performance isn't that bad with boxing. I have an application
that uses boxing *very* extensively (the Nemerle compiler, it uses
parametric polymorphism simulated with casting everything to object;
and yes we're planning code generator using generics) and it doesn't
perform *that* much better on MS runtime.
