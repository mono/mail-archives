What about a different explanation? Because to me it looks like that
with a crippled memcpy managed implementation you can get as bad results 
as you want. Attached a first cut that doesn't try to optimize away the
unaligned accesses. It beats the icall on my system until about 50-55
and is about 10% slower with lengths between 80-100 (and 10% is
definitely within the improvements we can gain in the jit). Also note
that it takes 3 80-char copies with the icall to gain back the time lost
with a single 10-char copy. Note it doesn't handle overlap, so I'm not
going to commit it: the few calls in stringbuilder that do need overlap
should be changed to call another function so the common case is handled
faster. I had hoped you would do that, but it looks like you wanted to
show how to write orrible and slow code instead.

Trivially optimized with about 5 lines of C code. Anyone out there who
wants to start some jit hacking? No asm knowledge required, the results
should look something like:
Old:
$ mono -O=all,-intrins benchmark/bulkcpy.exe
Elapsed : 4046 ms.
New:
$ mono -O=all benchmark/bulkcpy.exe
Elapsed : 1359 ms.

Nope. Well, you're free to spend your time porting it, maybe you'll
learn something. Once you have ported it we'll show you why it is not
needed.
