<PRE>Hola,

Right now, the GDIPlus class in gdipFunction.cs is marked as public. Is
there a reason for that? Do we need to expose anything public that is in
that class? It seems like its main use is a storage container for
internal static wrapper methods to hook onto P/Invoke. If there is a
need for some method in that class, would it make sense to keep GDIPlus
only for the P/Invoke functions and create a new class to house those
other methods?

Duncan.
