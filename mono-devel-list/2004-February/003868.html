<PRE>Q: Is there anything small that I can do to contribute to Mono?

A: Maybe.  In the fashion of all things that &quot;should be simple, but I
just spent hours working on this @#$% thing!&quot;, Yes, there should be
small things you can do to contribute, but only because they *look*
small.  That doesn't mean that they *will be*. :-)

Bugs in bugzilla are always something that can be looked at.  Resolving
them might not even be required; just running CVS-current and checking
to see if the bugs still apply (cleaning up bugzilla) would likely be
useful.  At least, this is useful for the Gnome bugzilla site, judging
by mailing list messages...

Fixing sugzilla bugs would also be good.  As well as running the
regression tests, and fixing any bugs that they show.

Some of these will be easy; some of these will be hard.

Writing test cases would also be useful, so that we can keep our class
libraries in good shape.  This should be simple to do, and will be very
helpful in the long run, though test cases aren't always the most
interesting things to be writing...

On the VB front, if you're into compilers I'm sure the mbas compiler
could use some additional help; talk with Nick Drochak
&lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">nickd at mono-cvs.ximian.com</A>&gt; and Rafael Teixeira
&lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">rafael at mono-cvs.ximian.com</A>&gt;.

The Microsoft.VisualBasic assembly could also use some help, IIRC.  I
know that Rafael Teixeira has been working on this (judging from
mono-cvs-list), so talking with him might be good, too.
