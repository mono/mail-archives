<PRE>I am attempting to successfully compile both mono and
mcs (and eventually gtk-sharp 0.16) on windows (XP
SP1) with cygwin and I have had some success with a
successful build of mono 0.30.1 by slightly modifying
these instructions I found on the mono-devel list:

<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-devel-list/2004-January/003439.html">http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-devel-list/2004-January/003439.html</A>

The snag I am having is when I try to compile the mcs
0.30.1 source.  When I run make I get the following
error:

$ make
make[1]: Entering directory
`/home/jgerdes/src/mcs-0.30.1/build'
make[1]: Leaving directory
`/home/jgerdes/src/mcs-0.30.1/build'
cd: can't cd to jay
make: *** [all-recursive] Error 1

I have noticed that the source does not contain the
jay directory but the cvs version does.  I am
currently just trying to get a downloadable release
version of mcs compiled and I was wondering if anyone
has seen this issue and how they went about solving
it.

I also would suggest putting some sort of updated
instructions on how to get all of these great tools
compiled on windows on the mono site.  It would be
very helpful for everyone trying to work with them on
windows.  I will be more than happy to send on the
instructions I have once I get them working fully.

Thanks,

Josh
