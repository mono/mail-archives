<PRE>Thanks!  

Miguel/Paolo... You've been very helpful and have given me enough to make
the argument to those who have ultimate control over my available time for
such an effort.  I will keep the list posted on any status.  In the
meantime, I've started to begin reading :-)  *cough* luckily *cough* I have
a 2 hour a day train commute so there is some time for reading.

You'll definitely here from me again (its just a question of how soon and
how much)...

Keep up the good work guys.  The (continued) success of Mono will have a
tremendous impact.  (and it has been one of my favorite projects to watch
since its inception)

- Mike

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm new to the list, fairly new to mono, and definitely a 
</I>&gt;<i> newbie when 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it comes to porting.  I'm an expert J2EE developer, 
</I>&gt;<i> intermediate .NET 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; developer, and rusty C developer.  Lately, I've been 
</I>&gt;<i> working primarily 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the embedded C arena, and would love to be able to port 
</I>&gt;<i> mono to a target
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; platform.   I'm not necessarily interested in a JIT runtime 
</I>&gt;<i> compiler, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rather just interested in having the ability to compile c# 
</I>&gt;<i> to a native
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; application.   
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> C# need the runtime to run, so you basically always need the 
</I>&gt;<i> jit anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Before I head down this path, I just wanted to know whether 
</I>&gt;<i> or not it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be possible.  What is the minimum system requirements for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; porting mono?  I'm looking for a recommendation (yeah or nah) given 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the following specs (and given your experiences):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - 166 MHz (MIPS) 32 bit RISC Processor
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - 16 Mb DRAM
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - 4 Mb Graphic Dram
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - 4 Mb Flash EPROM
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The current minimum sizes for the runtime is roughly 1 MB for 
</I>&gt;<i> the runtime and 1 MB for corlib. Of course both contain a lot 
</I>&gt;<i> of code that may not be needed for the applications that will 
</I>&gt;<i> run on the device and runtime memory usage could be shrinked 
</I>&gt;<i> a lot, too: we just haven't spent the cycles to optimize for 
</I>&gt;<i> size, yet.
</I>&gt;<i> In the end, it depends on what kind of applications you need 
</I>&gt;<i> to run: you can run them on mono/x86 and measure memory 
</I>&gt;<i> usage: it would be a fairly close estimate of how much it 
</I>&gt;<i> would take on mips. You could also use the profiling tools to 
</I>&gt;<i> see how memory use and speed could be improved to see if it 
</I>&gt;<i> would be ok on the embedded platform.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If possible can someone give me an idea about the level of 
</I>&gt;<i> difficulty 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and time estimate (minus the reading - which I know is 
</I>&gt;<i> substantial.  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; btw. I have a comp. eng. background, with hardware, 
</I>&gt;<i> assembly lang, os 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dev, experience)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since mips is very close to ppc, you can probably do a basic 
</I>&gt;<i> port in a couple of weeks. Supporting exceptions and some of 
</I>&gt;<i> the other advanced features will take a month or two (of 
</I>&gt;<i> course you need to double or triple the estimates for 
</I>&gt;<i> unscheduled late night debugging sessions...).
</I>&gt;<i> I have already written the low-level code to emit mips native 
</I>&gt;<i> code, so a chunk of the work is already done:-) Your 
</I>&gt;<i> background is very good for this sort of porting work, too.
</I>&gt;<i> Please also take a look at the porting document as suggested 
</I>&gt;<i> by Miguel and feel free to ask me (or on the list) any jit 
</I>&gt;<i> and runtime porting question you may have.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; P.S.  Out of curiosity has anyone attempted to port mono to 
</I>&gt;<i> the new TI 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and/or ARM based Palm OS devices?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Malte/Serge started a port of the JIT to ARM, but I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> know what is the status and it hasn't been submitted for 
</I>&gt;<i> inclusion in cvs. The port was for Linux: handling the PalmOS 
</I>&gt;<i> weirdnesses would undoubtly increase the complexity of the port.
