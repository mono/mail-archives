Depends on what test methodology you use. 

What you are talking about Ben is a pure black-box approach. If that is
the case - then sure! But if you have a white-box approach or a mixture
between bb and wb then it is very valid to &quot;look inside the box&quot;.

Everyone who has tested anything more than a simple Hello World
application knows that a pure black-box approache does not catch all
faults. Usually one uses several different methodologies and techniques
- but you know that Ben ;-)
