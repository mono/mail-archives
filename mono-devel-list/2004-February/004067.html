<PRE>Hi

There is a project in microsoft research called ILX that proposes 
functional extensions to IL like closures.
They implemented a Caml in .Net using ILX.

The adress is:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I assume that you meant I would emit these types at runtime. Even still,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>(though I appreciate your example) your code is little more than mapping
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>lisp primitives through a consideribly dense layer of object-oriented code,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>which goes against the purported point of the CLI, which is to allow lots of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>different languages to be implemented in a common runtime environment,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Why do you care about the implementation? It's like complaining that
</I>&gt;<i>many functional systems are implemented through &quot;a considerably dense layer 
</I>&gt;<i>of C code and assembly&quot;. The CLI offers a fairly comprehensive instruction
</I>&gt;<i>set and some runtime methods: using them you can implement C#, VB,
</I>&gt;<i>javascript, cobol, scheme, python, java etc... Sure, some of the
</I>&gt;<i>implementations may incur a speed hit when implemented on the CLR,
</I>&gt;<i>because of the need to implement special semantics that differ from the
</I>&gt;<i>expected ones. But the hit is most of the time reasonable if you're
</I>&gt;<i>willing to spend some time on the compiler (and it's repaid by being
</I>&gt;<i>able to easily interface with code written in other languages).
</I>&gt;<i>I guess what you're looking for is a runtime that implements lisp
</I>&gt;<i>primitives, so you can write your lisp compiler almost with no code:-)
</I>&gt;<i>That's nice, but you wouldn't get any interoperability and any of the
</I>&gt;<i>above languages would run a lot slower on that VM.
</I>&gt;<i>If you have proposals for how to integrate 'lisp primitives' with teh
</I>&gt;<i>CLR, please, present them as many people here would love to discuss the
</I>&gt;<i>issues. Just complaining that the CLR doesn't provide lisp primitives
</I>&gt;<i>(when they can most likely be easily implemented with Re.Emit...) is not
</I>&gt;<i>helpful (last time I checked hw lisp machines are not in much use nowadays, 
</I>&gt;<i>maybe there are a few reasons...).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Oh, I dunno. It's debateable. Developing a new compiler for mono could be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>considered mono related. The fact that it would work on any CLI compliant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>runtime is incidental. Besides, I didn't see any more appropriate mono-* list,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>and I figure you people have implemented a runtime, so you must be pretty
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>familiar with it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think mono-devel is appropriate for discussing how to make the mono and
</I>&gt;<i>the CLR better at handling different languages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Take a look at the DynamicMethod class from Net 1.2
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Thanks, Zoltan. Do you know if this class performs well enough to be used
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>as the primary function-calling mechanism of a language?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Function calls are a little more costly with delegates than with direct
</I>&gt;<i>calls (usually 2-3 times slower for empty methods): if your functions
</I>&gt;<i>actually do something it's not much of an issues (of course, where it
</I>&gt;<i>matters, you could build smarts in your compiler to do away with the
</I>&gt;<i>otherhead).
