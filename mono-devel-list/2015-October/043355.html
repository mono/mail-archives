<PRE>Hello team,

We want to try to get this release out by November 16th, so the focus at
this point is to address any major regressions left, or a critical/major
bug.

Other bugs, as interesting as they might be, will have to wait until a
Service Release fix.   I am moving cards that have not been merged with a *High
risk* tag at this point to the Service Release 1.

I anticipate that we have two scenarios:

*Major Problems found*: those are bugs that are too hard to workaround,
regressions that we did not identify, major problems in the software: we
respond with a HotFix.   If the situation is widespread and affects many of
our users, we deliver the updates as a Service Release 1 to our users.

*Normal Problems found: *We proceed as expected and get the bugs fixed.

*Actions*

*Team Leads*: I need your help, please help me move non-critical,
non-regression, non-important cards from the Cycle6 board to the Service
Release board:

From:
<A HREF="https://trello.com/b/U7vszrR9/platform-cycle-6-baseline-release">https://trello.com/b/U7vszrR9/platform-cycle-6-baseline-release</A>

To:
<A HREF="https://trello.com/b/FxUPE5pc/platform-cycle-6-service-release-1">https://trello.com/b/FxUPE5pc/platform-cycle-6-service-release-1</A>

*Green Lanes*: there are a couple of pull requests that will make the test
lanes go green, I am ok with merging those.

*Engineers: *please review the eight cards that have failed QA (Column 4)
in here:
<A HREF="https://trello.com/b/U7vszrR9/platform-cycle-6-baseline-release">https://trello.com/b/U7vszrR9/platform-cycle-6-baseline-release</A>

*Alexis/Cody*: we need to get to the bottom of the stock build issue that
is crashing Xamarin Studio on Drag and Drop/Stock Icon issue.

*Your Patches: *Please make your case by posting on this thread for any
patches that have not been moved to &quot;Ready to Test&quot; that you think needs to
be handled now.


Miguel.
