<PRE>I would expect this to look at http caching headers in response when
caching such as expiration, whether something is cachable (public/private) etc
but don't see any of that code (or maybe I missed it). Can you point to
where it is in your implementation?

</I>&gt;<i> Caching of
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> HttpWebResponses is the first one we took a look at. It would appear that
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft takes advantage of the internet explorer caching. Since it would
</I>&gt;<i> appear
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> that an HttpWebResponse is fully populated when it is returned from the
</I>&gt;<i> cache and the only content in the urls that are cached are the bytes that
</I>&gt;<i> come in on
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the wire, Microsoft must return things from the cache at a very low level
</I>&gt;<i> and and let the response populate the normal way. This did not seem
</I>&gt;<i> possible to
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> emulate when I looked at mono. I also wanted to cache to a directory so
</I>&gt;<i> that the urls can be inspected or deleted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  After looking at the code for awhile I realized that I could save
</I>&gt;<i> additional information from the response, ie: headercollection,
</I>&gt;<i> cookiecontainer, Status
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> code etc in the same file as the responsestream. A response can be
</I>&gt;<i> serialized but not all of it, most importantly the responsestream is not
</I>&gt;<i> serialized. I
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> wrote a prototype with some helper functions, the only change to existing
</I>&gt;<i> mono code would be in  HttpWebRequest.GetResponse. Before calling
</I>&gt;<i> BeginGetResponse
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I call a function that tries to retrieve the url from the cache. If it is
</I>&gt;<i> not there, BeginGetResponse is called as normal, the response is grabbed
</I>&gt;<i> from
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> EndGetResponse and passed to a method to insert into the cache. This
</I>&gt;<i> insert method will open a filename in a directory designated as mono_cache
</I>&gt;<i> with the name
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> produced by calling HttpUtility.Encode so it is a legal filename. Also you
</I>&gt;<i> can only read from the responsestream once, which means that if read from
</I>&gt;<i> it, save
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> it to a file, then the responsestream is no longer accessible from the
</I>&gt;<i> WebResponse when it is returned to the calling code. If sream copy worked
</I>&gt;<i> it could be
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> used here. One way to fix the problem is to call GetResponseStream(), read
</I>&gt;<i> it to the end, which produces a string, then finally convert the string to
</I>&gt;<i> bytes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then you can serialize the bytes to the open file, serialize the
</I>&gt;<i> headercollection and ultimately individually add any field you want in the
</I>&gt;<i> response when it
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> is retrieved from the cache, then close the file. Then create a new
</I>&gt;<i> WebConnectionData instance and populate it with headers and all the
</I>&gt;<i> relevent fields from
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the old response, finally passing the bytes of data to a memory stream
</I>&gt;<i> constructor and assign it to the WebConnectionData's stream member. Then I
</I>&gt;<i> construct a
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> new HttpWebResponse, passing the WebConnectionData and other arguments
</I>&gt;<i> which are taken from the existing request and the recently retrieved
</I>&gt;<i> response. The
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> response is then returned to getResponse then finally to the calling code,
</I>&gt;<i> good as new. Next time the url is requested the cached file is
</I>&gt;<i> deserialized, one
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> member at a time then a WebConnectionData is setup and finally, a
</I>&gt;<i> HttpWebResponse is constructed with the info read from the file, the
</I>&gt;<i> WebConnectionData and
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> from the members of the new request. I concentrated on prototyping caching
</I>&gt;<i> of HttpWebResponses. Only a simple cache algorithm, no Ftp, no File etc. No
</I>&gt;<i> cache
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> aging etc. There are many other things that would have to be done for this
</I>&gt;<i> to be usable.
</I>&gt;<i>   Using the prototype I requested www.google.com and it took .1601419 sec
</I>&gt;<i> to retrieve and cache it, including all the mechanics described above. The
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> second time returning it from the cache, building the HttpWebResponse took
</I>&gt;<i> .0007671. This is a 288 times speedup. That kind of performance increase,
</I>&gt;<i> from a
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> prototype that is not yet optimized, is compelling. I must add that I
</I>&gt;<i> measured the same experiment with google under the .Net 4.5 implementation
</I>&gt;<i> and the
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> speedup is 769x. Obviously thats something to work toward. Even falling
</I>&gt;<i> short of that level of speedup, some implementation of response caching for
</I>&gt;<i> mono
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> would greatly benefit the users who need better performance of services,
</I>&gt;<i> rest etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So far this is the only mono code that would change to support caching,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> from HttpWebRequest.cs:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   public override WebResponse GetResponse()
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   {
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    WebResponse response = ResponseCache.TryRetrieve (this);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    if (response == null)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    {
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     WebAsyncResult result = (WebAsyncResult) BeginGetResponse (null, null);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     response = EndGetResponse (result);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     response.IsFromCache = false;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     HttpWebResponse response2 = ResponseCache.TryInsert
</I>&gt;<i> ((HttpWebRequest)this, (HttpWebResponse)response);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     response.Close ();
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     return response2;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    return response;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The code can stand some improvement. It is a prototype and it shows.  I
</I>&gt;<i> have included the file ResponseCache.cs which the above
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> code hooks into. We were wondering whether anyone has tried to implement
</I>&gt;<i> response caching before and whether there is any intent to in the future.
</I>&gt;<i> What are
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> your thoughts about the approach described above and shown in the
</I>&gt;<i> ResponseCache.cs file and the 3 other files I included. Bear in mind it
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> would be refactored so that it fit into the mono architecture a bit
</I>&gt;<i> better, it needs to be generalized, different strategies for different
</I>&gt;<i> concrete response
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> types need to be plugged in, configuration. and a plethora of things I
</I>&gt;<i> missed. If you feel this approach has merit I can detail all that
</I>&gt;<i> seperatly. If you
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> feel a different approach would work better, please let us know, in the
</I>&gt;<i> end were looking to make mono more robust in some of the ways that are
</I>&gt;<i> expected but
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> not yet implemented.
</I>&gt;<i>  The main thing I want to show here is how it is possible, to wedge a
</I>&gt;<i> cache strategy into mono's request pipeline without changing or
</I>&gt;<i> destabilizing
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> mono itself. The cache implementation could change also, which is one way
</I>&gt;<i> that this is code falls short is it totally violates open-closed.  Is this
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> viable approach? There would of course be much more to do, that I have not
</I>&gt;<i> even mentioned here. Your comments would be appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The files can be found here.
