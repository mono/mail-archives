<PRE>Hello,

in the last weeks i was playing around to get the Mono runtime  3.0.10
built with openwrt and work on a MIPS based router (TL-WDR4300,
technical details here: <A HREF="http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300">http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300</A>).
Already the building required some patching, some of them openwrt
specific, some of them mono specific, probably i'll publish them later.
  After some experimenting and recompiling, the runtime seems to be
working on the target hw, but apparently the floating point support is
broken, so i couldn't get further than a simple helloworld application.
During searching about the issue, i found this bug:
<A HREF="https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=7981">https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=7981</A> , which probably has
the same root cause, but it seems the bug is not assigned to anybody
although it's more the 7 months old.
 Surfing on the internet i find references which say the MIPS arch is
supported ( <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Supported_Platforms,">http://www.mono-project.com/Supported_Platforms,</A>
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Release_Notes_Mono_3.0#MIPS_port">http://www.mono-project.com/Release_Notes_Mono_3.0#MIPS_port</A> ,etc), and
some others where it says it's &quot;not supported&quot; or &quot;community supported&quot;,
see Zoltan Varga's comments in the linked bug report for instance. So
now i'm wondering whether the MIPS arch is officially supported or not?
And If it's generally supported then which CPU versions are supported?
Big- and/or little endianess is supported? Hard and/or soft FPU-s are
supported?

 And more specifically: as i really just getting familiar with the Mono
internals (nice piece of sw btw:), i can't really see how much work is
needed to make this work properly on my CPU (MIPS 74kc, without hard
FPU), so i'm interested in any hints and estimation regarding to this.
(Naturally i'll attach test results, configurations, stacktraces when
it's needed, for now you can see a trace attached to the linked bug...)

Thanks in advance, best regards:
zgyarmati
