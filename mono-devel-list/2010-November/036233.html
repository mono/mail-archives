<PRE>Thanks!   Raphael said exactly the same thing to me.  Now I have two questions:

- How much does the async stuff in C# 5.0 resemble the Cilk spawn-sync
model?  And how much async stuff is implemented in the mono trunk?

- I don't know anything about CIL other than it is roughly equivalent
to Java bytecode -which Raphael told me it isn't and CIL is kind of a
low-level OO language on its own!

- Now I need to understand more about CIL, could you please point me
materials to start?  Also what is the relationship between CIL and
Java / LLVM bytecode?

Thanks again for your help!

</I>&gt;<i> I guess I am also confused as to why you would need to have C# to C# as an
</I>&gt;<i> intermediate step.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are you thinking that you would want to manually edit and maintain the
</I>&gt;<i> generated C#? &#160;I mean are you really seeing your modified C# as a Domain
</I>&gt;<i> Specific Language (DSL) that is really just a code generator?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would seem easier to modify the C# compiler to directly generate CIL
</I>&gt;<i> (Common Intermediate Language) that calls your runtime library.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can call your runtime library from CIL just as easily as you can from C#
</I>&gt;<i> code. &#160;The C# compiler already spits out CIL. &#160;Just modify it to spit out
</I>&gt;<i> CIL that calls into your runtime library. &#160;This will be much easier than
</I>&gt;<i> what you are proposing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure how familiar you are with CIL. &#160;It is what all .NET languages
</I>&gt;<i> like C#, Visual Basic, and Boo are compiled down to. &#160;It is often described
</I>&gt;<i> to be like assembly language but it really is not. &#160;It is really a pretty
</I>&gt;<i> high-level OO language in it's own right.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> CIL is like assembly in that it lacks many structured language features,
</I>&gt;<i> like looping constructs, and instead uses jumps and conditional branches
</I>&gt;<i> (like goto and if statements if you like) to achieve equivalent results.
</I>&gt;<i> However, it is fully object-oriented and supports classes, fields, and
</I>&gt;<i> methods with full support for inheritance, polymorphism, and virtual
</I>&gt;<i> methods. &#160;Access levels like public and private or modifiers like static
</I>&gt;<i> (singleton) are all supported as well. &#160;It also has a wide range of
</I>&gt;<i> operators and a complex type system with integers, floating point types, and
</I>&gt;<i> even arrays and generics. &#160;CIL has full access to the .NET framework and
</I>&gt;<i> method calls are by name and argument signature. &#160;You can easily call into
</I>&gt;<i> your library from CIL just as you would from C#.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do not believe that you need to have C# as an intermediate step.
