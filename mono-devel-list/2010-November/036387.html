</I>The best option, imho, is to use the forms authentication framework (unless you have a very
specific application which absolutely needs to use the Unix/Windows user database). You can take
advantage of the Membership and Role providers in your MVC application - implementations of them
exist for basically every RDBMS and also for LDAP, plain XML, plain text files (alas, Mono's
implementation of the ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider is just a stub - patches welcome, of
course :D). If you can't find a provider that suits your needs, it's easy to create a custom one,
tailored to your environment.
If this is not desirable, you can easily roll out your own authentication provider using any
database (from LDAP/ActiveDirectory to any RDBMS) as the backend and just the forms authentication
ticket/cookie services to keep the user logged in.
If you wanted to authenticate users on Linux using their physical account credentials then things
will get a bit complicated. In order to be absolutely compatible with the multitude of ways to
authenticate users on Linux you'd have to use PAM and that would require either to grant your
application special rights or use a daemon to which the application would talk in order to
authenticate the users. If you want to keep your server/application users in one place and use the
same credentials on Linux, Windows and your MVC app, then I'd recommend looking at OpenLDAP to
implement your own directory server.

Hope that helps a bit,
