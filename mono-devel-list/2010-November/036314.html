I take that as a challenge.

Sounds like fun.

Do you have anything like a &quot;new runtime hacker's orientation&quot; document?
I still don't really understand a lot of the basic concepts in Mono.

For instance, I'm trying to figure out why ldftn/calli is 70 times slower
than delegates in a kernel I'm working on, and it seems to be spending
most of that time in common_call_trampoline, but I can't figure out what
that function is supposed to do.
