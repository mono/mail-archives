<PRE>
I have cross compiled mono 2.8 with libgdiplus for the s3c2410 processor I am
running. It is an arm920t (armv4t architecture).  I use scratchbox with a
recent codesourcery toolchain.

I have two test applications that I wrote in visual studio targeting .net
2.0.  The first is a console app with a basic &quot;Hello world&quot;.  It works
perfectly.  The second is a winforms app with a single form that has a
simple label that gets updated with a timer control to show the current date
and time. (basically a digital clock).  Running it, I get the following
error:

* Assertion: should not be reached at tramp-arm.c:48

Checking /mono/mini/tramp-arm.c, the function in question is
mono_arch_patch_callsite, which has two blocks of code, where one of them is
supposed to run.  I'm not sure exactly what it's checking here, but neither
block gets executed, so it hits the assertion.  Can anyone shed some light
on what might be the problem?

One note that may or may not be of interest, but because the codesourcery
toolchain is multilib, I have to specify -march=armv4t on the CFLAGS passed
to configure mono.  This appears to be working, as my console app works
fine.

I do have a running X server, which I've tested with other native apps, so I
know at least that part is functional.

Thanks,
Matt
