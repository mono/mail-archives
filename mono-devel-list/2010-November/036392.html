<PRE>I don't think you should use the MONO_MWF_MAC_FORCE_X11 flag to try these changes, as then you wouldn't be using the native Mac driver anymore, which means you wouldn't notice any changes before and after the patches, then.
In the first place, as Ralph was trying to get his app to work on Mono, I proposed him to look into the MONO_MWF_MAC_FORCE_X11 flag, and he replied:

&quot;Thanks for the X11 solution tip. I tried it and it does seem more
stable but it does not support a Mac native Clipboard which is a
mandatory in my case.&quot;

Objet: Re: Mono Winforms on Mac: Clipboard patches

Hi,
I gave a first look at the clipboard patch. I applied the patch in my
version and tried it.  Honestly I have to  say that I never saw
clipboard (copy and paste) working on WinForms/OSX, and unfortunately
I did noticed any change (but no regressions either)  in the behavior
of tests launched after the patch have been applied: this either by
setting   MONO_MWF_MAC_FORCE_X11=1 or by unsetting it.

I want to remark that the code in the static constructor of XplatUI.cs
tests only for the existence of the environment variable
MONO_MWF_MAC_FORCE_X11 but not for its value: I do not now if setting
MONO_MWF_MAC_FORCE_X11=0 is considered a valid option or not.

I will continue to look after the other changes,
Matteo
