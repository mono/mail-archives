<PRE>I've been using mono for years but i've been a fairly crappy citizen  
about giving back. I'm basically a rpm only consumer, never having  
built from source, so my approach is mostly one trying to find  
workarounds to bugs. Yeah, i know selfish and lazy...

Lately i've been doing a lot of ASP.NET MVC2 work under mono 2.6.7 and  
keep running into small issues. I have the source for mono and use it  
spelunk about to figure out what's going on, but generally just use  
that knowledge to figure out work around. I'd really like to provide  
patches for the things I come across, but I'm intimidated by the scope  
of getting an environment in which I can test things out. Maybe it's a  
lot easier than I imagine, so i figure i should ask here if there are  
some pointers for the things that hold me back:

1) any recipes to getting an environment for building and testing mono  
under Visual Studio (2k8, but i can use 2k10)?
2) what code do i build and create patches against? Since i'm on  
2.6.7, so i use the mono-2-6-7 branch or is that frozen and i should  
use mono-2.8?

thanks,
Arne Claassen
