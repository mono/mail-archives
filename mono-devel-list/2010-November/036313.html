</I>&gt;<i> Is this the kind of thing that is due to be addressed in Mono 3.0?  Anybody
</I>&gt;<i> working on it now?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It is one of those &quot;It would be nice to have&quot;, but we have plenty of large
tasks that are taking our time, including our new garbage collector, various
ports and supports to platforms that help fund the Mono team and many bug
fixes.

Although I could say &quot;we accept patches&quot;, I understand that patches to
implement full tail call optimizations are beyond the means of most hackers.
  Hence, let me propose that another way of making sure we have the spare
cycles to look into this is to take bugs away from us.

By going to bugzilla and fixing bugs, and implementing features that other
members in the community need, you release us from doing some of that work.
  It also has the advantage that you do not have to be a runtime expert to
help, you can pick any of the bugs that we have in our plate in any space
that you are an expert on, or you want to become an export on.
