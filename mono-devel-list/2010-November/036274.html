<PRE>Yes it is troublesome to work with NuGet in Mono, as:

1) it uses extensively .NET 4.0 features, some of which still aren't
implemented in Mono, or are in development, so unreliable.
2) lots of things are tied to PowerShell (not in NuGet itself, but on common
packages like for MVC Scaffolding), and we don't have it on Mono.
3) NuGet is sometimes downright buggy, after all, it is still in development

I'm trying to use just the Core for now, but with little success so far, so
my fork is already beginning to look like it a real Fork, I'll try to learn
some Mercurial (I prefer Git) to see if I can push upstream the needed
changes, as I make things work.

I'll move my attention to porting the NuGet packager (sometimes it means in
truth to implement something in Mono, thus it is hard to make it work with a
stable distro packaged Mono).

Said all that, I need to admit that I have little time to work on that
project, so progress is slow and help is welcome.
