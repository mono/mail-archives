</I>&quot;Not as bad&quot;, are you serious?, you must read the NDA again, is very, 
very clear and specific, there is no room for misunderstandings.
&gt;<i> out to be. Everyone who is been the loudest are not under an NDA, and
</I>&gt;<i> the people I talk to who are under the NDA seem to hint that it is not

</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>The reason way is *still* not as big of a deal, is just because this is 
a new NDA targeting iphone OS 4 SDK, which is still not a big target, 
people using OS 3 SDK NDA can still use the tools that they want..
&gt;<i> Somehow I think that if the Mono guys have been able to do what they've
</I>&gt;<i> done with .NET and Microsoft, that Monotouch will come out Ok.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>Sure, let hope that all this end up successfully for MT,  adobe, unity, 
etc (I really hate ObjC)..but my point is that until we know a 
definitely answer from Apple, the future of MT is at least uncertain, 
and is good to take some responsibility when someone says something like 
&quot;sure, you can develop using Monotouch, ...&quot;


&gt;<i> *IANAL, nor am I on the Mono team, nor do I speak officially for anyone.
</I>&gt;<i>    YMMV. HAND.
