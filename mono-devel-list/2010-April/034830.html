I tried to compile Mono 2.6.4 (trunk of 2.6 branch) with Clang/LLVM trunk
(1.5/2.8) and it seemed to work without a hitch.  All I did was set CC to
/usr/bin/clang.

Is there any reason that I should not be building Mono with Clang/LLVM? 
Does it bring any advantage?

The build was on a setup that is just for playing around so this kinda falls
into the &quot;see if it works&quot; category.  That said, it would be very nice if
compiling Mono was faster and less resource intensive.  This machine is
often busy with a few such tasks and I compile Mono trunk fairly often to
see how things are coming along.

The web is all abuzz about LLVM.  Would it make the parts of the Mono
runtime that are written in C any more performant?  If it does, and if this
is a relatively safe operation, I would consider building Mono this way on
machines that are less experimental.

Anybody have any idea?

PS.

I tried the same build (Mono 2.6.4 with Clang/LLVM trunk) on a CentOS 5.4
box and it failed.  The test system mentioned above is running Ubuntu Lucid
Lynx (due out in a week) and it also built on Ubuntu Karmic.
