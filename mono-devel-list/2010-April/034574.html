<PRE>Hello Fran&#231;ois,

&gt;<i> Le Thu,  1 Apr 2010 02:27:57 +0200, Andreas F&#228;rber a &#233;crit :
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Haiku has no full serial support, especially no TIOCOUTQ or TIOCM_*.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Provide a no-op implementation similar to null-gc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, TIOCOUTQ is not found on opengroup.org, neither are TIOCM_*
</I>&gt;<i> which seem to be from SysV.
</I>
This one's still at v2, so I haven't reworked it yet.

&gt;<i> As I said, there is no reason to skip serial support because of  
</I>&gt;<i> that...
</I>
The patch fixes a blocking compile issue, so as long as Haiku doesn't  
provide the defines/symbols used or you tell me which available ones I  
might use instead, I need such a patch to compile at all.

Even if Haiku gets new ioctls to provide serial support, a null  
implementation may still be useful for other platforms. There's  
console-null and null-gc, for instance.

&gt;<i> TIOCOUTQ can be easily added to Haiku, or the BSD variant FIONWRITE.
</I>
I have virtually zero knowledge of ioctls and no opinion on which  
ioctls or non-POSIX things you might want to add to Haiku. I was under  
the impression that Mono works under BSDs though.

Since Miguel suggested a serial-PLAT split, you might even add a new  
BYOUROWNIOCTL that I could use in a serial-haiku implementation. What  
did BeOS do? R5 did have a SerialConnect app.

&gt;<i> As for TIOCMGET and friends it should be possible to #ifdef it out to
</I>&gt;<i> return -1 with errno = ENOSYS. The calls already have provisions to
</I>&gt;<i> return errors.
</I>
Wasn't that pretty much what my initial version did? That was rejected  
on the Mono side.

&gt;<i> Unless used by a low level app like a serial flasher app
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see why one would need to use modem lines directly, so for  
</I>&gt;<i> most
</I>&gt;<i> apps it shouldn't be needed...
</I>
My test machine has one serial port only, and that's occupied for  
kernel debug output, I fear. So I'd need to use QEMU, and it's no fun  
compiling Mono under emulation (tried it for sparc32). I don't have  
any C# serial apps to test ATM anyway.
