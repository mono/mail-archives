<PRE>Hey,

Join us in the #monosoc channel on irc
(<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/IRC">http://www.mono-project.com/IRC</A>). Also, I believe the deadline for
proposals is tomorrow so you should probably submit a proposal asap
which can be updated/modified later on as required. If you miss that
deadline, there's not a chance of the project being selected.

Alan.

&gt;<i> Dear Mr. de Icaza and the Mono Developer Community,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First, I would like to salute you for producing an excellent, open platform
</I>&gt;<i> for software development. Second, I would like to apologize for bothering
</I>&gt;<i> anyone who is not interested in a student's proposal to improve it. I
</I>&gt;<i> appreciate your time and any feedback you might give.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am proposing to expand Mono's C++ interop support to enable the creation
</I>&gt;<i> of managed wrappers directly around native C++ objects. This would make C++
</I>&gt;<i> libraries callable directly from managed code without the need for wrapping
</I>&gt;<i> them in a flat C API, COM interface, or requiring the use of mixed binaries
</I>&gt;<i> (C++/CLI). In fact, this could also provide a way to implement the C++/CLI
</I>&gt;<i> language, including IJW, in a cross-platform manner.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The first place I read about calling C++ functions directly from managed
</I>&gt;<i> code was on Mono's &quot;Interop with Native Libraries&quot; page. It suggested
</I>&gt;<i> setting the EntryPoint of the DllImport attribute to the C++ mangled
</I>&gt;<i> function name to call that function directly through P/Invoke. However, it
</I>&gt;<i> wasn't until I read this blog post by Jim Springfield that I realized that,
</I>&gt;<i> not only could this be a viable technique, but that by messing with virtual
</I>&gt;<i> tables, native C++ classes could effectively be subclassed by managed code.
</I>&gt;<i> This technique could allow for seamless managed wrappers around native C++
</I>&gt;<i> classes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Jim Springfield's example is tied completely to Microsoft's Visual C++
</I>&gt;<i> compiler, and this illustrates the largest problem with this approach: that
</I>&gt;<i> C++ ABIs are different among different compilers and even between different
</I>&gt;<i> versions of the same compiler. To help ameliorate this issue, I have taken
</I>&gt;<i> the basic principles in Springfield's design and abstracted out any
</I>&gt;<i> ABI-specific components into an abstract class. A different subclass of this
</I>&gt;<i> CppAbi class can then be implemented to support each compiler's different
</I>&gt;<i> name mangling schemes and other idiosyncrasies. At runtime, the correct
</I>&gt;<i> CppAbi instance can be chosen when loading the C++ library depending on
</I>&gt;<i> platform or other conditions. Reflection.Emit is then used to generate the
</I>&gt;<i> P/Invoke code and implement trampolines to facilitate virtual method calls.
</I>&gt;<i> Eventually I hope to support seamless exception handling and other features
</I>&gt;<i> supported by C++/CLI on Windows.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I realize this sounds very ambitious, but I've already implemented a
</I>&gt;<i> proof-of-concept based on a simple C++ class, similar to the one Jim
</I>&gt;<i> Springfield uses in his example. It is hosted on Google code at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/cppinterop/.">http://code.google.com/p/cppinterop/.</A> Please note that this really is just a
</I>&gt;<i> proof-of-concept-- I've only implemented the Itanium C++ ABI, and only in
</I>&gt;<i> part. If you are using a recent version of GCC to compile C++, you should be
</I>&gt;<i> able to compile the example and call it directly from managed code. I've
</I>&gt;<i> only tested this on an Intel Mac running OS X 10.4.11.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would include some details about myself, but I feel like this email is
</I>&gt;<i> already long enough. So if there is anything in particular you would like to
</I>&gt;<i> know, or any feedback you might have, please feel free to contact me. Thank
</I>&gt;<i> you very much for your time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sincerely,
