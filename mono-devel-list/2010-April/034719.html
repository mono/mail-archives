<PRE>I would think that you could develop your own bindings, as there are
at least 3 other implementations that I know of. However, like most of
us, IANAL. The MonoDroid and the efforts by Koushik Dutta[1] may be
one and the same, but I don't know right now. On Novell's side, there
is quite literally no information other than &quot;we're working on it and
here's the name.&quot; I'm eagerly watching Koush's RSS for anything
Android + Mono related. It appears that the last part of the puzzle
which is still missing, is a tool to generate the C# bindings from the
Java API.

As for the LGPL, the mono runtime binaries installed on the phone
should easily be user replaceable. And if it's an open source app,
then there's no problem at all.

If anyone has any more info, please reply. I'd imagine that many
people are waiting for any information at all.

Joe

</I>&gt;<i> Would I be allowed to develop my own java bindings (obviously they wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> be as high-quality as Novell's commercial product) for mono on android and
</I>&gt;<i> deploy mono-based applications without licensing Novell's commercial
</I>&gt;<i> product? Would I subsequently be able to release said bindings under an
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate open source license?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems natural to assume so, but you need to be a lawyer to understand
</I>&gt;<i> software licensing these days.
