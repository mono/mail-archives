<PRE>Koush responded to my tweet saying that he stopped working on it when Novell
announced their own plans for Droid bindings. I don't think he ever
committed the binding generator code to his git repository. It's a pity,
because as a hobbyist mobile developer I certainly couldn't afford the
licensing fee for a commercial monodroid license, but given even basic
bindings without the kind of Visual Studio/MonoDevelop tooling support one
would expect in the official MonoDroid, I could certainly make due. It would
be easy to allow the user to replace the runtime on their phone - just
distribute the code for the bindings and the eclipse project to build the
android package that installs it. I believe that would satisfy the
requirements of the LGPL. Or am I missing something?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Would I be allowed to develop my own java bindings (obviously they
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be as high-quality as Novell's commercial product) for mono on android
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; deploy mono-based applications without licensing Novell's commercial

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It seems natural to assume so, but you need to be a lawyer to understand
