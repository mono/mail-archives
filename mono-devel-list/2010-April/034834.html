In all seriousness, I think that it's not as bad as people are making it 
out to be. Everyone who is been the loudest are not under an NDA, and 
the people I talk to who are under the NDA seem to hint that it is not 
as big of a deal as it is made out to be.

Somehow I think that if the Mono guys have been able to do what they've 
done with .NET and Microsoft, that Monotouch will come out Ok.

*IANAL, nor am I on the Mono team, nor do I speak officially for anyone. 
  YMMV. HAND.
