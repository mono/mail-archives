Thanks Miguel.

I really appreciate the reply.  I thought it was worth asking as somebody
may have already done the benchmarking or might have more technical insight
into the safety or performance issues.

I assume that some pretty key pieces of Mono, such as the GC, are in C so I
am surprised to hear that you would not expect much bang for buck if the C
performance improved.  I was especially interested in how System.Drawing
might be impacted since I believe that libgdiplus is C.

I built Mono 2.6.4 with Clang/LLVM trunk on OpenSUSE 11.2 and I noticed that
TLS was normal instead of __thread so that is a strike against Clang/LLVM at
this point I would think.

I assume the article you are talking about is the recent Phoronix benchmark. 
I saw that after posting and, I agree, it seemed to indicate that Clang/LLVM
was mostly lagging recent GCC in performance and was certainly a lot more
unpredictable in terms of results.

It might just make sense to wait for a little more consistency from
Clang/LLVM before benchmarking or considering it for anything real.  That
same article seemed to show a pretty nice performance lead when compiling so
Clang/LLVM is worth keeping an eye  on though.
