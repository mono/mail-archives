IMHO this would be a good contribution (but I can't speak for mono 
maintainers). I've even seen some opensource projects which forbid 
building within the same tree, to avoid breaking out-of-tree builds by 
mistake. Out-of-tree builds also make it much easier to clean build 
artifacts (like the files that ./autogen.sh and ./configure generates), 
so another advantage of forcing out-of-tree builds is that .gitignore 
files get much simpler (i.e. just ignore build/*).
