Very interesting indeed Bryan. And very much the type of fire and forget
development and deployment process I am trying to work towards myself here.

For what it is worth I have been building embedded Linux platforms with
Yocto (and prior to that OpenEmbedded) and am finding this an excellent
build environment to manage commercial, source-controlled,
license-aware, cross-platform builds of embedded Linux.
 
Most of our recent deployments have been Freescale i.MX based, but I too
have been looking at the RPi because I have a strong belief in the
disruptive nature of a $25-$35 price-point for a full-fat embedded Linux
platform. Opening the door of the embedded arena to students and
hobbyists via RPi / Arduino / Intel Galileo and so forth is going to
reap  huge rewards for society in terms of innovation in our future, imho.

As such, I've been maintaining the meta-mono layer for the Yocto
project, which builds Linux Mono 3.4.0 for various targets, including
RPi, in a controllable and maintainable manner.

I put this walkthrough together on Mono + Yocto recently as I believe
there must be a substantial number of enterprises out there with the
.NET skill-sets, legacy .NET code, and the desire to deploy to Linux
targets.

And this is a little older, but gets a Yocto build up for RPi -

Hopefully of interest.
