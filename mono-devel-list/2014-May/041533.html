<PRE>Hello.

I'm trying to build mono under Yocto. Recently (so I've heard) there
were some changes such that the autotools scripts are being run from
outside of the source tree.

I presume this is something like:

cd mono
mkdir monobuild
cd monobuild
../autogen.sh


[<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">cmorgan at localhost</A> monobuild]$ ../autogen.sh --prefix=/home/cmorgan/mono-prefix
grep: configure.in: No such file or directory
../autogen.sh: line 125: mono/mini/Makefile.am: No such file or directory
../autogen.sh: line 126: mono/metadata/Makefile.am: No such file or directory
Running aclocal -I m4 -I .  ...
aclocal: error: 'configure.ac' is required

**Error**: aclocal failed. This may mean that you have not
installed all of the packages you need, or you may need to
set ACLOCAL_FLAGS to include &quot;-I $prefix/share/aclocal&quot;
for the prefix where you installed the packages whose
macros were not found


This doesn't appear to work because several things in autogen.sh
assume that the files are present in the current working directory.
Some other steps however do use $srcdir.

My question is whether it seems like a reasonable idea to correct
autogen.sh to remove the assumption that builddir == sourcedir. If so
then I'll go down this route and send a patch. If not then I'll use a
Yocto work around for projects that don't/can't support doing that.
I'm not big on papering over issues so I do prefer the first option
but I didn't want to start work if it turns out that it may be a
nearly impossible task.

Chris
