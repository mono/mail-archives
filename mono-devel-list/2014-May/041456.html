</I>&gt;<i> To build Mono on Windows, you will need to use Cygwin to build you entire
</I>&gt;<i> stack. &#160; Cygwin is a Unix-on-Windows system that will let you properly build
</I>&gt;<i> Mono.
</I>
Any pointers on how to get that to work?  I am nothing, if not helpful at documenting some process and then sharing it for others - I was motivated to get this working, I spent about a day on it last Sunday, and failed.  I never got a successful build.

I tried cygwin 32 bit, 64 bit...  I tried git checkout with sourcetree somewhere on C: but I found there were line endings problems, and I found some things on the internet suggest you need to use cygwin binaries (install cygwin git) to checkout to a cygwin mount (for example in your home directory) and in fact, I found that solved the line endings problem, so I think that was a good move...  

I was following suggestions from here:
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Compiling_Mono_on_Windows">http://www.mono-project.com/Compiling_Mono_on_Windows</A>

In particular, I installed all those packages, I used ./autogen.sh --host=i686-pc-mingw32, and I included a few additional packages including gettext, which really *should* be dependencies for git.  The best progress I ever got: make would run like a half hour or so, and then fail.  I forget the exact error messages now, there were about a dozen failed attempts, and eventually I just ran out of time and gave up.
