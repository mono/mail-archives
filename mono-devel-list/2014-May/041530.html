<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know whether it's relevant, however we recently upgraded an
</I>&gt;<i> ASP.NET WebForms application from 2.0 to 4.0 and there were numerous
</I>&gt;<i> little gotchas on the. NET runtime.  Granted a lot of these were with third
</I>&gt;<i> party libraries, but I would be concerned that this could simply cause some
</I>&gt;<i> applications to just not work.  Therefore causing people to need to setup
</I>&gt;<i> parallel mom installations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That said, I don't know anything about the approach you're suggesting as
</I>&gt;<i> to whether the same issues could occur.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>They could happen, there is nothing on my approach that would magically fix
it.

But we have limited bandwidth, and we are struggling to maintain pre-async
code in the class libraries.

The lack of await turns every programmer into a glorified accountant,
bookeeping things everywhere.  And we have a series of bugs that we have
struggled for months to solve due to what amounts to poor bookkeeping in
our part.

So we can either try to suck it up and fix the bookkeeping --in a piece of
code that is basically impenetrable-- or accelerate our pace of development
by killing the old stack.
