<PRE>It would be nice if the Makefile could turn the prefix argument
mandatory, or making it /usr/local by default.

I regularly build from CVS, and today I found out that I installed
accidentally on /usr/lib.

REgards!

</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, here are some of the goodies in the new build system:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	* Unified build system for Windows and Linux. Windows is still fairly
</I>&gt;<i> untested, but &quot;should work.&quot; Unfortunately I don't have a Windows
</I>&gt;<i> machine to test on, but Gonzalo can get corlib to build I think and
</I>&gt;<i> that's about as complicated as it gets.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	* Profile support. 'make PROFILE=profilename' or 'export
</I>&gt;<i> PROFILE=profilename ; make' will work. Profiles are defined in
</I>&gt;<i> build/profiles/profilename.make ; right now there isn't too much going
</I>&gt;<i> on. The 'bootstrap' profile will build the way makefile.gnu did on
</I>&gt;<i> Linux, by setting MONO_PATH and using mcs/mcs.exe; the default profile
</I>&gt;<i> will build against the existing system libraries and compile with 'mcs',
</I>&gt;<i> which should reduce a lot of 'corlib out of sync' warnings.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	* Important variables are shared among makefiles now; you can edit
</I>&gt;<i> build/config.make (see build/config-default.make for a template) and
</I>&gt;<i> give global settings, or just have a much saner time of writing new
</I>&gt;<i> makefiles.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	* Response files, stamps, and other build trivia now all land in
</I>&gt;<i> build/deps/, making the library build directories cleaner.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	* Test libraries now live in class/Library/Library_test.dll, not
</I>&gt;<i> class/Library/Test. 'make test' will build the test DLL, 'make run-test'
</I>&gt;<i> will actually run the nunit tests. Set the variable TEST_HARNESS to run
</I>&gt;<i> with a program other than nunit-console (for example, nunit-gtk).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	* Standardized recursive targets: all, clean, install, test, run-test.
</I>&gt;<i> Read build/README.makefiles for definitions of what they should do
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	* (Relatively) sane 'make dist' target; 'make distcheck' support; cute
</I>&gt;<i> 'make monocharge' and 'make monocharge-lite' targets. They're made
</I>&gt;<i> possible because 'make install' now supports DESTDIR a la automake,
</I>&gt;<i> which I'm sure someone cares about.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	That's all I can think of at the moment. If there are any problems,
</I>&gt;<i> please tell me; I'm more than willing to fix them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Share and enjoy,
</I>&gt;<i> 		Peter

Whip it, baby. Whip it right. Whip it, baby. Whip it all night!
