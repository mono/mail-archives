Peter,

I am having trouble getting the nunit tests to run.  So far I've found the
following problems:

1) nunit-console.exe and NUnit.Framework.dll and NUnit.Util.dll all need to
be in the same directory for nunit-console to work.  At least that's the way
i get it to work.  Otherwise, nunit-console.exe can't find its dll's.

2) to test corlib_test.dll on .NET we need to link (with /r) it with
corlib_res.dll, which it doesn't seem we build anymore.  If we link it with
our corlib, it doesn't work either.

Now, these two things might be just naive workarounds for the problems we
see, but that's the solutions we had in the old .build files.  If there's a
better solution, I'm all for it.  Otherwise, can we get a corlib_res.dll
back into the build and link corlib_test.dll with that?

Thanks,
Nick

P.S.  Nice meeting you. Hope the bike ride back wasn't too scary.
