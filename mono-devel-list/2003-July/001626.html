<PRE>I believe that this patch also addresses a problem on os/x. I have been debugging handles.c and wait.c. The pthread_wait_* calls are returning an 'invalid argument' return code when being called by the _wapi_*wait functions.

In a nutshell, since these calls were correctly generating the timeout threshold (abstime), I was thinking that the remaining two params (condition and mutex) were somehow invalid. 

This resulted in a pegged-cpu situation in OS/X when falling back to non-shared handles.

  Subject: [Mono-devel-list] handles.c patch



  I eventually realized that one reason things were slow for me is that the thread management thread was in a busy loop because mutexes weren't initialized so calls continually failed.

  I am not 100% sure this is the correct fix but it addresses my test case. I am currently configuring with shared handles disabled. The fix makes everything twice as fast for me having removed a busy thread.

  I assume this matters on HP because initializing mutexes to zeroes isn't the right thing to do yet presumably is OK on other platforms.
