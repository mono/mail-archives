<PRE>I was wondering about using macros after all the repititions but had just
done it the long way as it was before.

But clearly the changes are trying to do the same thing so we should just
end up with one way of doing it. Maybe someone from ximian should comment on
their preference and then we can work together to one solution and submit
the result.

and making some instructions work better


Hi Bernie,

I have some similar changes re. NATI .  I tried to factor out as much code
as possible and came up with a couple of macros to handle the result types
correctly. I copied an example for +,-,* and / at the end of this message.

Our changes might conflict, do you think we could merge them before checking
in?

-Laurent
