<PRE>Hello,

Aleksey, thanks for your nice works!

&gt;&gt;<i>I would appreciate if someone can take a look at this patch, review it and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>commit to CVS. Also it would be great if someone can run the new tests
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>on Windows (I don't have MS .NET myself).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I'll do both and also maybe Atsushi can review the XML parts (to take a
</I>&gt;<i>break from XSLT). However this may take some time as I won't be home for a few days (if it can stop raining...).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>No problem. I have already asked Ben to wait until I improve somehow
DTD and XML Schema stuff (and in fact he has been going on awful works 
that I couldn't have done :-) )

&gt;&gt;<i>Also I would be interested in helping with implementation of XML and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>XML Security stuff in Mono. It seems that there are a lot of things to do (for example, I had little success with using XML entities or running some xpath expressions). I wonder if there is someone else working on this stuff.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Great news! Get in touch with Atsushi for the XML parts and myself for the security parts (use my home address for quicker responses). We're both often on IRC (#mono at irc.gnome.org) but at different times (Japan and Canada).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It is great if you're interested in xml libraries :)
As Sebastien wrote, we cannot talk so often (but anyway I won't
appear as usual Japanese...) I usually appear UTC afternoon
(but not every day).

Well, I think, current XmlValidatingReader can handle default
attributes, but I haven't hacked normalization (it depends on
attribute's type) and entity handling yet. These days I was
working only on XML schema stuff, but I'll look at them tonight.

Atsushi Eno
