<PRE>Sorry for the AF_INET6 miss, I'll check twice next time.

Here is a patch for the socklen_t issue. Does it address all of what you
were talking about ?

Jerome.

Subject: [Mono-devel-list] socket-io.c patch for machines that don't
have IPV6



I attach a patch for socket-io.c so it compiles on machines that don't
support IPV6. There was some code using PF/AF_INET6 that wasn't properly
ifdef'd.

This patch also actually makes all the line endings in the file
consistent as they were a mixture of CRLF and plain LF.

I am not 100% sure the code is completely correct since it uses &quot;int&quot;
rather than socklen_t in several places - but I haven't tested that out
yet.
