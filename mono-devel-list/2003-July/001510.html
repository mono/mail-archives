<PRE>Hi,

I'm not sure what you are meaning with this. But if you mean that you cannot
remove the enumeration after compiling because somebody might use
enum.ToString() then you are right.
However there is no case in which anybody should use ToString on that enum
anywhere.
The enum in this case basically serves as an auto-(re)indexing int field

You're forgetting enum.ToString().

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've read your answer, but it seems that at quite some points
</I>&gt;<i> you overlooked advantages (maybe I'm also wrong with any of
</I>&gt;<i> these, but I don't think so). So I added some addidional
</I>&gt;<i> comments to it
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; right now there is nearly no localization support in the
</I>&gt;<i> Mono class
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; libraries and all strings (mainly for errors) are
</I>&gt;<i> hardcoded into the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; source-files.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks for this proposal, I have some comments in this
</I>&gt;<i> email about the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specifics of the proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Initially, I wanted to use it, but it meant that we would have to:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * deviate from the standard practice (something I would not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   mind, if there were strong enough arguments for)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The basic arguments are:
</I>&gt;<i> * Much faster
</I>&gt;<i> * Much smaller Assembly size (see below)
</I>&gt;<i> * Much smaller RAM need
</I>&gt;<i> * More safe when programing because of compile errors for e.g. typos
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Create and maintain a new infrastructure for localization.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Not bad per-se, but it would minimize the reuse of existing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   knowledge that people might acquire or obtain from the NET.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Reimplement the chunks we already have for handling resources
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   in corlib to cope with all the CultureInfo bits.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is not neccesarily true. The sample implementation I did
</I>&gt;<i> is using System.Resources namespace to get it's localized
</I>&gt;<i> data internally. More specifically it ALLOWS to use it if you
</I>&gt;<i> want, but does not force you to if there is a better solution
</I>&gt;<i> somebody wants to implement. And you can change this solution
</I>&gt;<i> at any time without having to change anything in the sources.
</I>&gt;<i> You could even use the now-used string tables and still save
</I>&gt;<i> a litte memory (see below: Strings as 16bit).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I also want to avoid loading all the strings in memory, but it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible to do so:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; with a call like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Print (MS.GetString (MonoString.GenericENullNotAllowed));
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We should use the Resource infrastructure in .NET here:
</I>&gt;<i> there are many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; issues related to loading the proper assembly given the selected
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; CultureInfo, and the code is mostly implemented.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The file format for resources allows for this case: it is
</I>&gt;<i> possible to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fetch the information without having to load all the strings to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; localize.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What we need to do is improve the implementation of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ResourceSet.GetObject.  Basically we should define an
</I>&gt;<i> internal method
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the ResourceReader that can do lookups based on strings, without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; having to use the resource enumerator.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK - but IMHO your solution just has two flaws:
</I>&gt;<i> * Reimplement the chunks we already have for handling resources
</I>&gt;<i>    in corlib to cope with all the CultureInfo bits (which is
</I>&gt;<i> exactly what you wanted to avoid above)
</I>&gt;<i> * Sooner or later you will always come to the
</I>&gt;<i> GetResourceStream function, which actually provides a memory
</I>&gt;<i> stream, which is: loading all things into memory (and if you
</I>&gt;<i> want to provide a complete second infrastructure for strings,
</I>&gt;<i> then the work that has to be done would be IMHO FAR more work
</I>&gt;<i> than anything you might have to do to implement something
</I>&gt;<i> like my suggested
</I>&gt;<i> solution)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We already have an API that can load a string from an index, so the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only thing we have to do is perform a binary search on the
</I>&gt;<i> strings in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the file (like Monodoc does now for its help).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry but IMHO this it total overkill. You want to perform a
</I>&gt;<i> binary search DIRECTLY on a file containing an estimated
</I>&gt;<i> 200KB string values EVERY time we do a string lookup. Are you
</I>&gt;<i> sure this won't totally fry your HDD. And what about if the
</I>&gt;<i> assembly we are accessing is on e.g. a network share that has
</I>&gt;<i> slow access times? IMHO you will need to load string index
</I>&gt;<i> that into memory in any case to perform a binary search (or
</I>&gt;<i> probably ANY other search)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I already said: Even with a binary search you will just
</I>&gt;<i> get search speeds of O(ln n) while my solution would get O(1)
</I>&gt;<i> and that is without taking into account that you have to do
</I>&gt;<i> the binary search on STRINGS, not on int's
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The Advantages are:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; * Smaller Assemblies (probably leads to faster runtime
</I>&gt;<i> performance
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; in Jit also because Jiting a constant int should be faster than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Jiting a constant string)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, the space that you save on strings, say the string:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Null not provided&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Would be encoded into an enumeration:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Null_Not_Provided
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And that would end up in the metadata as well, so the
</I>&gt;<i> change in size
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is only half the size (strings are stored in 16-bit ucs-2 encoding).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't even think about savings from not-having-to store as
</I>&gt;<i> unicode ;) - that even adds to data savings :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think you are overlooking a LOT of things here:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First example:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Mono now: Key = &quot;Null not provided&quot;, Translation = &quot;Null
</I>&gt;<i> not provided&quot; 2. Suggestion: Key = Null_Not_Provided,
</I>&gt;<i> Translation = &quot;Null not provided&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In that case key equals about the size of Translation. As you
</I>&gt;<i> said we only need half the size for the enum value. So we
</I>&gt;<i> need: 1. Memory: SuggestionKey * 2 * 2 (we also need it in
</I>&gt;<i> the lookup table) + Translation 2. Memory: SuggestionKey * 1
</I>&gt;<i> + Translation SAVING is: SuggestionKey * 3 If you want to
</I>&gt;<i> store the string somewhere to not have to hardcode it into
</I>&gt;<i> each individual class to prevent e.g. spelling errors (seems
</I>&gt;<i> to be what MS
</I>&gt;<i> does) this even grows to a saving of:
</I>&gt;<i> SuggestionKey * 4
</I>&gt;<i> with inlining? active at compiling to a saving of: SuggestionKey * 6
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Second example (IMHO somewhere about what it could be in
</I>&gt;<i> reality): 1. Mono now: Key = &quot;Null not provided because we
</I>&gt;<i> have never provided null&quot;, Translation = &quot;Null not provided
</I>&gt;<i> because we have never provided null&quot; 2. Suggestion: Key =
</I>&gt;<i> Null_Never_Provided, Translation = &quot;Null not provided because
</I>&gt;<i> we have never provided null&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This should show the savings at a SuggestionKeySize about
</I>&gt;<i> half of the size of the string itself (I would estimate this
</I>&gt;<i> to be a good total average): 1. Memory: SuggestionKey * 2 * 2
</I>&gt;<i> (we also need it in the lookup table) * 2 (double the size) +
</I>&gt;<i> Translation 2. Memory: SuggestionKey * 1 + Translation SAVING
</I>&gt;<i> is: SuggestionKey * 7 !!!!!! for the other options described
</I>&gt;<i> above it would even save: SuggestionKey * 8 or SuggestionKey * 12
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A saving of SuggestionKey * 7 (with the settings of the
</I>&gt;<i> second example) would in reality mean a saving of about 70%
</I>&gt;<i> TOTAL size (including the
</I>&gt;<i> translation)
</I>&gt;<i> In the first example we would save about 60% size
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also for extremely memory limited devices you probably can
</I>&gt;<i> remove the enumeration completely after compiling (all enum
</I>&gt;<i> members are compiled into int's), which increases savings even more.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All that I stated now are just savings in assembly size. At
</I>&gt;<i> runtime the savings are EVEN HIGHER! At runtime Mono should
</I>&gt;<i> never need to access the enumeration keys (everything is int
</I>&gt;<i> now) so the need for RAM is probably about 80% LESS than the
</I>&gt;<i> current solution!!!! That all with more programing safety and
</I>&gt;<i> much higher access speeds at much lower CPU usage.
