<PRE>
I attach a patch for socket-io.c so it compiles on machines that don't support IPV6. There was some code using PF/AF_INET6 that wasn't properly ifdef'd.

This patch also actually makes all the line endings in the file consistent as they were a mixture of CRLF and plain LF.

I am not 100% sure the code is completely correct since it uses &quot;int&quot; rather than socklen_t in several places - but I haven't tested that out yet.
