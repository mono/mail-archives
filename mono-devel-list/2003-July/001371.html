Yes, that code is broken, but your patch is not correct, because it
could cause int64 and doubles to be aligned on 8 byte boundaries,
which is incorrect on x86. so you need something like:

#ifdef __x86__ /* add other archs as appropriate */
#define DOUBLE_ALIGNMENT 4
#define INT64_ALIGNMENT 4
#else
#define DOUBLE_ALIGNMENT 8
#define INT64_ALIGNMENT 8
#endif

And then use INT64_ALIGNMENT or DOUBLE_ALIGNMENT in the function.
The rounding up needs to be done using sizeof (gpointer) as you point
out: since I guess that's what most of the platforms do.
I didn't apply the marshal.c chunks of your patch.

Thanks for the fix.

&gt;<i> actually think the second thread should actually wait for initialized to

</I>
No: if initialized was set it can return, if it's not set but
initializing is set it means it's a recursive call from the same thread
that was already initalizing the type and we need to return to avoid a
deadlock.

</I>
Well, there are interesting issues. For the normal code (and once the
above issues with sizeof(gpointer) and alignement are fixed) there
should be no issue, because the runtime should lay out all the fields as
necessary for the platform. In some cases, though, the marshal code
should insert unaligned. opcode prefixes so that the execution engine
uses the appropriate code that doesn't trigger the unaligned fault
handlers. I'm afraid, though, that that neither mint nor the jit use
the unaligned prefix, yet, but as I said, if the rest of the code is
fixed, you should not hit this case normally.
