<PRE>Hello,

I've builded Mono on my FreeBSD 4.8. It had compiled succesfully with
some warnings. Moreover, I had to add signbit function manually in
some very simple way, because I've compiled it with gcc 2.95.4.

But when I'm trying to compile something (any source file) with mcs,
it does nothing. You can spend a year waiting for some output from
the compiler.

I didn't try to run smth with Mono yet, cause I don't have any
compiled code, but there are already some problem with compiler, so
something is already wrong.

What kind of problem it can be? In general, I'm not a specialist in
Unix programming, I just want to have working Mono interpreter and C#
compiler.

BR,

Fedor
