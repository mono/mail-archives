<PRE>JAcob,
Thanks for these useful words of advice. With some help from another guy
from some other forum, I was able to install all the RPMs. I did not know
that I am going to need xsp stuff for ASP.Net. I laso mostly deal with web
apps and server side apps. So GUI is not of great importance to me right
now. 
Now the next step for me is to simply compile a HEllo World application on
Linux. If that works then I can figure out the stuff. I will keep everybody
posted. I will document everything that I do in this learning porceess. And
at the end I will post this document for others to learn.

Naveen

Naveen,

Having just recently installed RedHat 7.3 for the
first time about a month ago to see what all the Mono
noise was about, I understand where you're comming
from. From experience, I can tell you that you are
probably going to become good friends with the search
button. : )

I never did come accross any &quot;dummies&quot; guide that I
could really understand. Linux is so different, and
everyone allways assumes you know what their talking
about when they say &quot;just download the latest tarball
and run make and make install.&quot; Here is some of the
limited advice I can give you to help get you started.

- There are plenty of forums out there on general
Linux stuff. One that I used to get started was the
one at www.linuxiso.org. Whatever you do, don't just
post a question without searching for every word you
can think of that relates to your question. In
general, try to do as much research as possible, and
if you still get stuck, ask for help on a specific
problem, like: &quot;I can't seem to get the mypackage.rpm
to install. Here is the command I'm running.... and
this is what happens.&quot; You'll get much more usefull
advice this way. It's probably also good advice for
posting to this mailing list.

- Download the following files from
<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/download.html">http://www.go-mono.com/download.html</A> (I'm assuming by
linux 9 you mean RH9)
mono-0.25-1.ximian.*.*.i386.rpm 
mono-devel-0.25-1.ximian.*.*.i386.rpm 
Someone correct me on this if I'm wrong, but it looks
like the garbage collector is included in these new
rpms. I upgraded from 0.24 using these two files, and
it worked fine. To install the rpms, open a command
prompt window and type something like this:
cd /home/user/monodownload/ 
rpm -i mono*.rpm
This will get the basic framework installed.

- To do ASP.NET, install the xsp mini web server. (I'm
currently only working on web stuff, so I can't tell
you what you would need for the GUI libraries to
work.) For instructions on installing it (there's no
rpms) search the forums on www.gotmono.com for &quot;xsp
make install&quot;. Doing this the first time was kinda
scary, but it really is easier than it sounds.

At the start, there were moments when I wanted to
throw my computer out the window and take a vow never
to touch Linux again. It was worth it though.

Regards,
-Jacob
