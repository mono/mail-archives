Hi,
Linux 9.0 do you mean Red Hat Linux 9.0 ?
In that case it's not at all hard to get everything to work.

There are 2 easy options
1) RPM based install
2) Red-Carpet install

Since I assume you are familiar with the Windows operating system,
think Red-Carpet as a tool simular to Windows Update
(www.windowsupdate.com)

How to get Red-Carpet

Download these files if you are using Red Hat 9
<A HREF="http://www-files.ximian.com/red-carpet/redhat-9-i386/rcd-1.4.3-0.ximian.6.1.i386.rpm">http://www-files.ximian.com/red-carpet/redhat-9-i386/rcd-1.4.3-0.ximian.6.1.i386.rpm</A>
<A HREF="http://www-files.ximian.com/red-carpet/redhat-9-i386/red-carpet-2.0.1-0.ximian.6.1.1.i386.rpm">http://www-files.ximian.com/red-carpet/redhat-9-i386/red-carpet-2.0.1-0.ximian.6.1.1.i386.rpm</A>

Then you can run these files by double clicking them in your Window
Manager or you can install them trough the console (as root)

rpm -Uvh red-carpet-2.0.1-0.ximian.6.1.1.i386.rpm
rpm -Uvh red-carpet-2.0.1-0.ximian.6.1.1.i386.rpm

After installing you need to run red-carpet
- Open a linux console, log in as root or use the su command to become
root and type red-carpet

Red-Carpet will load and you can then select Mono and Gtk-Sharp from the
Channels list. 
Then goto &quot;Available software&quot; and select Mono and GTK-Sharp from that
list and mark the packages for install (right-click --&gt; mark for
install)

Once you've done that you can just click &quot;Run Now&quot;, it will download
and install Mono for you.

This approuch although a bit more work than the normal RPM install
will allow you to update automatically when mono 0.26 or any other
version is released.

If you are using another linux surf to
<A HREF="http://www.ximian.com/products/redcarpet/download.html">http://www.ximian.com/products/redcarpet/download.html</A>
and select the linux version you have.


If you don't want to use red-carpet goto
<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/download.html">http://www.go-mono.com/download.html</A> and download all files for RH9

Then install them by either double clicking them in your Window manager
or using rpm -Uvh nameofrpmfile in the console (as root)

The installation of applications on linux is indeed not always
very easy, that's why I hope one day Mono will bring xcopy deployment to
the Linux operating system.

After installing mono,
you can create a simple C# application and compile it with 

mcs mycsharpapp.cs

then you can run it with 

mono mycsharpapp.exe

(both commands in the console of course, and you don't have to be root)

Hope this helps you out.

Tim.
