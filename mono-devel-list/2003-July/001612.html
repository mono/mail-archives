<PRE>Aleksey,

&gt;<i> I would like to propose a patch that provides XML Canonicalization
</I>&gt;<i> transforms implementation for System.Security.Cryptography.Xml
</I>
Great! That's the BIG missing piece in S.S.C.X.

&gt;<i> The patch (see attached file) includes C14N implementation that later
</I>&gt;<i> could be extended to support Exclusive C14N as well.
</I>
Even greater to support WSE!

&gt;<i> Also there are about a dozen new test cases from C14N spec.
</I>
Still better - I'm curious to see how it will do in .NET (AFAIK MS still has
some C14N issues).

&gt;<i> The code more or less mirros the C code I wrote for LibXML2
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://xmlsoft.org">http://xmlsoft.org</A>) and xmlsec (<A HREF="http://www.aleksey.com/xmlsec">http://www.aleksey.com/xmlsec</A>) libraries.
</I>
I had the chance, a few months back, to get a look at xmlsec and that's
pretty good stuff you did!
Seems that we're lucky that you're interested in C# :-)

&gt;<i> I would appreciate if someone can take a look at this patch, review it and
</I>&gt;<i> commit to CVS. Also it would be great if someone can run the new tests
</I>&gt;<i> on Windows (I don't have MS .NET myself).
</I>
I'll do both and also maybe Atsushi can review the XML parts (to take a
break from XSLT). However this may take some time as I won't be home for a
few days (if it can stop raining...).

&gt;<i> I have tried to contact Sebastien Pouliot (who seems to be the
</I>&gt;<i> maintainer for this module) but he did not respond.
</I>
Sorry I'm on vacations right now :-) so I read my office's email too often
(not more than once a day ;-).

&gt;<i> Also I would be interested in helping with implementation of XML and
</I>&gt;<i> XML Security stuff in Mono. It seems that there are a lot of things to do
</I>&gt;<i> (for example, I had little success with using XML entities or running
</I>&gt;<i> some xpath expressions). I wonder if there is someone else working
</I>&gt;<i> on this stuff.
</I>
Great news! Get in touch with Atsushi for the XML parts and myself for the
security parts (use my home address for quicker responses). We're both often
on IRC (#mono at irc.gnome.org) but at different times (Japan and Canada).

System.Security.Cryptography.Xml is almost complete except for (most of) the
Transform classes - see <A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/crypto.html">http://www.go-mono.com/crypto.html</A> for more details.
As you can see I far more inclined to crypto than XML ;-).

There is also an incomplete implementation of MS Web Service Enhancement
(WSE) but it's not yet commited into CVS due to some licensing issues in
WS-Security (Miguel is looking into this...).
