<PRE>
I attach quite a large patch for interp.c to primarily cope with 64 bit big endian machines though it also includes some fixes to instruction handling particularly for OVF instructions - and generating exceptions for some other operations properly. I have tried to get instruction behaviour correct re handing of native int correct as per the spec. Also every exit now goes via a label (exit_frame) partly for debugging and also because in some experiments I wanted to add code for it.

No doubt there may be issues with the way I have done things but I though I'd post it for review.
