<PRE>Aleksey,

&gt;&gt;<i>Still better - I'm curious to see how it will do in .NET (AFAIK MS still
</I>has
&gt;&gt;<i>some C14N issues).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Hm... Not to my knowledge. At least there were no reports in xmlsec
</I>&gt;<i>mailing list and I know that many people use xmlsec with MS .NET.
</I>
I've been using the .NET framework for quite some time - I made a XKMS web
service (both client and server) two years ago (using the .NET beta 2).
There are still a few bugs in version 1.0 but I'm unsure about 1.1 (from
mono's unit tests I know that some were fixed) as I just installed 1.1 on my
new computer.

&gt;&gt;<i>Sorry I'm on vacations right now :-) so I read my office's email too often
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>(not more than once a day ;-).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Ops.. My mistake, I've intentionaly decided not to use your home email :)
</I>
NP but vacations isn't my only distraction from mono - it may take me more
than 1 day to answers email when working ;-).

&gt;<i>Well, the transforms are the most complicated part because you can
</I>&gt;<i>optimize a lot. I have looked at
</I>&gt;<i>the current code and it seems that we can do some performance
</I>&gt;<i>improvements. I'll probably send you
</I>&gt;<i>my suggestions later (it's my second day with C# and Mono and I am still
</I>&gt;<i>learning).
</I>
Post them to the list - I'll catch them there. This way other peoples can
review them (patches or suggestions) and (maybe) commit them if I'm too
busy.

&gt;&gt;<i>There is also an incomplete implementation of MS Web Service Enhancement
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>(WSE) but it's not yet commited into CVS due to some licensing issues in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>WS-Security (Miguel is looking into this...).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I decided not to implement WS-S in xmlsec because of exactly the same
</I>&gt;<i>reason. Don't want to
</I>&gt;<i>be sued by IBM/Microsoft :)
</I>
That's the reason Miguel is investigating the license issues with Ximian
management.
I hope we'll have a GO soon to commit into CVS. It would be a shame to fall
behind the new web services standards right now (when we just got both
client and server web services running on mono).
