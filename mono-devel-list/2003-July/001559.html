***

Can anyone provide light or clarification on the issues with building
mono / mcs 0.25 from source packages or via CVS with FreeBSD 5.1 and Mac
OS X? The sources for Mono 0.25 (and current CVS) successfully build on
FreeBSD 5.1. mcs 0.25 is a chicken/egg problem. mcs 0.24 and latest
monocharge give errors ranging from the infamous &quot;bus error&quot; that dumps
a core to various NullException's. About as far as I can get, either
with 0.25 or from the latest CVS sources, is 'mono --trace mcs.exe
foo.cs' will begin parsing but eventually hang in the tokenizer. This
happens regardless of the given size or complexity of a .cs file.
Various historical posts indicate issues either with libgc or
threading/signal differences. I've also encountered some of Reggie's
issues previously but my /usr/local is so mucked up after attempting to
iron out the issues last night I think I'm going to have to remake all
of /ports to restore some lib sanity.

At this point, I'm interested in getting CVS to build correctly and
regularly on FreeBSD 5.1 and Mac OS X 10.2/10.3 (Dev Preview) and to
keep it that way moving forward. Any plans for a bsd.make or osx.make in
mcs/build/platforms at some point? I'm willing to assist anyone working
on this area with test/config work, dev/porting work or perhaps most
important, documenting the process and dependencies.

Mono, Gtk# and the Mono tools should run well on FreeBSD and OS X as it
makes progress to 1.0. A good start might be to document the minimum and
recommended versions of the libs, tools and utilities, ie., X version of
gcc, x version of autoconf, etc. Even better may be the versions Ximain
uses if they do daily builds for particular platforms and any
deviations/patches to those versions.

System info, debug output, a bug report in bugzilla, etc on the issue at
hand, building CVS successfully on FreeBSD 5.1 and Mac OS X 10.2/10.3,
can follow on/off-list if anyone has the time or desire to give an me
assist.

&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    The new build system was a step in the direction of simplifying the
</I>&gt;<i> existing framework for building the &quot;MCS&quot; module, but as you noticed,
</I>&gt;<i> it does not address the common problem of the runtime and the class
</I>&gt;<i> libraries being out of synchrony when updating from CVS.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    I have added a new target in the `mono' directory (the one driving
</I>&gt;<i> the runtime build) to also drive the build for the `mcs' directory.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    To use this, do:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	cd mono
</I>&gt;<i> 	./autogen --prefix=/usr/local
</I>&gt;<i> 	make fullbuild
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    The above works for me to upgrade from a Mono 0.25 installation to CVS.
