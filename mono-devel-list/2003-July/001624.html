<PRE>Re: [Mono-devel-list] handles.c patchThis still fails.

As I said I wasn't sure my patch was quite right. But it is the private_list's shared_cond &amp; shared_mutex that I am initializing (though maybe in the wrong place) not the shared ones. _wapi_handle_timedwait_signal waits on these if _POSIX_THREAD_PROCESS_SHARED is undefined and they don't seem to be initialized anywhere else.

  &gt; I eventually realized that one reason things were slow for me is that

  &gt; weren't initialized so calls continually failed. 

  Strange... 

  &gt; I am not 100% sure this is the correct fix but it addresses my test 
  &gt; case. I am currently configuring with shared handles disabled. The fix 
  &gt; makes everything twice as fast for me having removed a busy thread. 

  This shouldn't actually do anything, because the shared mutex code 
  should be disabled.  Please try the attached patch instead and see if 
  that has the same effect. 

  &gt;  
  &gt; I assume this matters on HP because initializing mutexes to zeroes 
  &gt; isn't the right thing to do yet presumably is OK on other platforms. 

  I'll save your suggested patch for when I get the time to make the 
  shared mutex code work.  The new Linux thread libraries support 
  process-shared objects. 

  Thanks,
