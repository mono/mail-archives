<PRE>According to <A HREF="http://mono.ximian.com/monobuild,">http://mono.ximian.com/monobuild,</A> the runtime tests on Mac OS
for the PowerPC have been timing out for quite some time, and the same tests
on Mac OS for Intel have been outright failing. I have access to both of
these platforms, and I've been considering trying to track down the source
of these problems.

 

So far, I've only been building Mono on Intel, and aside from the name of
the test that is failing (handleref), I don't know too much about it, other
than the fact that some sort of signal is being triggered. Does anyone know
more about this, or am I pretty much on my own?

 

Also, this is sort of a noob question, but is there any way to either hook
into Monobuild or into the Subversion repository so that I can trigger a
build on my own machines when things are updated? My development work tends
to expose a number of bugs in Mono, and I don't always have the time to
track them down (although I do most of the time). It would be nice if
continuous integration process that I'll be setting up over the next few
days (I finally have something to continuously integrate!) could also check
to see if bugs had been fixed in the main repository.
