<PRE>Hi again,

On 3/30/07, Joe Shaw &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">joe at ximian.com</A>&gt; wrote:

I got a little ahead of myself here: I'm obviously looking at the code
for System.Net.Sockets.Socket here.

&gt;<i> I don't know much about the Socket class and how the async IO
</I>&gt;<i> works, but it boils down to the fact that BeginReceive() is being

</I>&gt;<i> is being called enough (or possibly at all) to balance the load.
</I>
I actually noticed something else:

The object array in question has an average size of 10.6 megs, but it
only holds 56 references to SocketAsyncResult at the time of this
snapshot.  So this seems to indicate to me that the enqueues and
dequeues do ultimately match up, but that the allocation pattern is
bad and probably not interspersed.  That is,

enqueue, enqueue, dequeue, dequeue, enqueue, enqueue, etc.

would mean that an array could be as small as 2 items and still work
for N items, assuming a 1:1 match..  But if the pattern is instead,

enqueue, enqueue, enqueue, enqueue, dequeue, dequeue, etc.

then it would have to be at least N.  Now pretend N is a million. :)

Joe
