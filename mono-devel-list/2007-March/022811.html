<PRE>Hello Pablo,

&gt;<i>  I've just downloaded, compiled and tested latest from SVN. We had several
</I>&gt;<i>  problems, many of them regarding to the list view, which are now fixed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  But the bad news is: the tree view is broken (it doesn't even show up),
</I>&gt;<i>  there are many problems on form resizing (our wizard was working correctly
</I>&gt;<i>  two weeks ago or so and now is totally broken).
</I>
Do you by any chance have a small test case that would illustrate the
problem?    

We are sorry for the inconvenience, but a big patch has landed on trunk
to fix several issues in Windows.Forms and trunk might have regressed in
a few areas.

&gt;<i>  Maybe it will also help if somebody (I would do it myself) could check the
</I>&gt;<i>  fixes before they are integrated (branch per task would greatly help
</I>&gt;<i> here...
</I>&gt;<i>  :-P )
</I>
Our problem is that we do not have a large enough test suite of
Windows.Forms applications.   We clearly need more, and we are going to
get someone in charge of QA, but we do not have that person yet.

</PRE>
