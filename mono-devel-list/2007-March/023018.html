<PRE>Hi,

Yep, that's your problem right there. ;)  Also, if you look at the
&gt;<i> summary you posted, you'll notice that in the course of 1 second, you
</I>&gt;<i> have 9 resizes going from a size of 2.8 megs to 322.6 megs.
</I>

Yup, i had noticed that ;) There is something fishy, but i can't find out
what it is. I've run heap-shot and attached and emailed the results in
already. Hopefully they'll make sense to someone. By the looks of it,
there's some kind of problem internal to mono which is resulting in this
rapid memory usage as on MS.NET this doesn't happen. There could easily be a
bug in my own code and MS.NET just handles it better, but i have no idea
what is causing the problem to start off with, so i can't fix it.

Im not using remoting as such, I assume that internally AsyncSockets make
use of the remoting framework. I do make heavy use of those, but i'm using
them in the way they're supposed to be used.

Any further advice would be brilliant.

Alan.
