<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> When I checked about using the interpreter, I've read somewhere that it wasn't
</I>&gt;<i> up to date anymore (maybe the info was too old and it's now up to date to
</I>&gt;<i> execute everything, anyone can confirm ?).
</I>
It still builds, but no maintenance has gone into it.   It is also
missing important things like generics support, that was never updated.

But the main problem you have with the interpreter is that the
interpreter *also* needs to generate dynamic code.   All the trampoline
code is emitted at runtime so you need to have that.   

So in short: the interpreter just generates *less* code than the JIT,
but it still generates code.

I heard from an embedded customer of ours that they are looking at
pregenerating all the trampoline code but am not sure this is a long
term strategy.

Miguel.
