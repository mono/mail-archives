<PRE>Hi Jordan,
     Source code would be helpful here (I think you are using an svn server
somewhere...). If Moma is correct, then you should be able to run on mono
with little effort. I would suggest installing the latest mono 1.2.3, and
giving it another go. If you're problems were mainly winforms related, they
may be fixed as a *ton* of progress was made between 1.1.18 and the current
release.

The error you pasted below is not really helpful. Normally some more
description is given if a particular method/class is missing. If it can't
find the 2.0 System.Windows.Forms assembly at all, perhaps the 2.0 profile
is not installed (this seems very unlikely).

Beyond that, the source to your app (or a link to some binaries) is probably
required for additional help. BTW, if you need 'lightweight help' and don't
to send an email you could try the IRC channels (
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/IRC">http://www.mono-project.com/IRC</A>). Particularly #mono-winforms may be useful
to you.

Thanks,
Jonathan
