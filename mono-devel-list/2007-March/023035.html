<PRE>Ok, i did a quick bit of testing on my code.

Firstly, the 54 instances of SocketAsyncResult do make sense. Typically
there will *always* be a pending BeginReceive on every socket i have opened.
Therefore 54 instances of SocketAsyncResult would correspond to 54 open
connections, which is pretty standard stuff.

Every call to socket.BeginXXX or socket.EndXXX goes through a TCPConnection
class, so i added a count there so i could see how many calls to each
BeginXXX and EndXXX method i actually make. The results were pretty much as
expected. There was always a difference between BeginReceive and EndReceive
pretty much equal to the number of sockets i have open. The difference
between BeginSend and EndSend was always close enough to zero, which would
also make sense as most messages i'm sending would only be a few bytes in
size. The difference between the BeginConnects and EndConnects is always 5.
This is right as i've set it so i only connect to at most 5 people at any
one instant.

So i can rule out a bug in my code that's causing millions of BeginXXX's
without corresponding EndXXX's. There'd typically be between 80 and 120
Begin/EndReceive calls a second, which isn't that much really. A similar
amount for Begin/EndSend.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; That huge object array, in turn, is referenced by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; System.Collections.Queue -&gt; System.Net.Socket.Socket , specifically
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; readQ member.  So basically it means that the readQ member in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; System.Net.Socket.Socket is a huge Queue, which internally has an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; object array, which apparently has millions of SocketAsyncResult
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; objects inside.  So how those are being allocated?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; These objects are created a lot[...]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I got a little ahead of myself here: I'm obviously looking at the code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for System.Net.Sockets.Socket here.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I don't know much about the Socket class and how the async IO
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; works, but it boils down to the fact that BeginReceive() is being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; called probably millions of times, but it doesn't look like Complete()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; is being called enough (or possibly at all) to balance the load.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I actually noticed something else:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The object array in question has an average size of 10.6 megs, but it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only holds 56 references to SocketAsyncResult at the time of this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; snapshot.  So this seems to indicate to me that the enqueues and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dequeues do ultimately match up, but that the allocation pattern is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bad and probably not interspersed.  That is,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; enqueue, enqueue, dequeue, dequeue, enqueue, enqueue, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would mean that an array could be as small as 2 items and still work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for N items, assuming a 1:1 match..  But if the pattern is instead,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; enqueue, enqueue, enqueue, enqueue, dequeue, dequeue, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then it would have to be at least N.  Now pretend N is a million. :)
