<PRE>I'm the main developer of Open Dental Software, www.open-dent.com.  I've
been talking about porting it to Linux for 4 years, and now is the time.  I
have developed it as a C# WinForms program in VS 2005.  I ran the Moma
utility, and the list of necessary changes looks nice and short (eight
missing methods) since I purposely avoided using WinForms 2.0 classes.  So I
compiled from VS, and then copied all the files over to my Linux computer in
usr/local/opendental/ .  I'm using SUSE 10.2, which has Mono 1.1.18 on it.
Then, when I run &quot;mono OpenDental.exe&quot;, I get this error:
 
System.Windows.Forms version 2.0.0.0 could not be loaded, etc.
 
I thought maybe it was one of the issues that Moma was warning me about.  So
I fixed the four that would have happened during startup.  Didn't help.  Did
I launch wrong or something?

I'm going to do my very best to not send any unnecessary emails to this
list, and only ask for help when I'm totally stumped.  While I'm waiting for
an answer, I'm going to go install Prj2Make# and try it from that angle.
Thanks in advance to anyone who's willing to help enlighten me.
