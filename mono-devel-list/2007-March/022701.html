<PRE>Hi,
For OProfile I am just implementing part of the project as a graduate
course project. I am implementing the memory map from mono JIT 
to OProfile. How OProfile handles this data and match it with the 
anonymous methods it has, is implemented by someone else in the Lab 
and still not complete yet. Now we are able to get reports about mono 
apps using opreport and it will give us each method sampled with its fully 
qualified name. The problem is with callgraphs. OProfile gave us the call 
graphs for mono itself (runtime, GC) but always gives us the name of the 
managed methods isolated i.e. alone. Here is a sample form the output 
for a recursive mono benchmark. As you can see we have a problem 
when it comes to JIT.App which is the managed code. 
But the mono methods are well. So this looks like as if Ack, Fib and 
Tak are running separately in different stacks and also isolated from the 
mono runtime itself. Otherwise we should have at least seen Main
method as it calls each one of them respectively. May be the problem is
related to our OProfile patch but I just wanted to avoid any surprises:)

Thanks.

Yes, we use the frame pointer.

There can be a finalizer thread, too (if it's not disabled).

Interesting!

But why should OProfile ignore the gc and finaliser stacks-threads?
IMHO, one of the great things of OProfile is that it's a system-level
profiler, which samples everything... what if in my application those
threads play an important role performance-wise?
Of course it's possible I'm missing something...

However, I had the impression that the only thing that OProfile needs to
know is the mapping from memory regions to methods in the source code.

BTW, are you basing your work on the OProfile/Java integration done
by IBM, or are you restarting from scratch?

Ciao,
  Massi
