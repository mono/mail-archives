<PRE>Hey!

&gt;<i> Also, I uploaded to updates to the class doc. I'm just wondering if
</I>&gt;<i> anyone has had a chance to read them over. I'd like to know if I
</I>&gt;<i> should continue documenting things in that style.
</I>
I got them, I just need to review them.

&gt;<i> Finally, I'm hoping to add some new contributor features (thus the
</I>&gt;<i> creation of the Contributing menu) and would like anyones opinion on
</I>&gt;<i> whether the creation of a small list window to display the
</I>&gt;<i> contributions pending for upload would be something people would want.
</I>&gt;<i> It is something I would use. 
</I>
It sounds useful, but I think that we need a couple of improvements in
general to Monodoc to make contributions more useful.

I think that there are a couple of things that could improve things:

	* A WYSIWYG editor.

	* Maybe a &quot;live&quot; connection to get documentation updates, so
	  when something is documented any consumer of Monodoc would
	  be able to get the data.

We also need someone that can act as an editor and can help me with the
reviews of all the pending contributions.   We have many pending
contributions that I have not accepted because for each one, I have to
review that the contribution is not a direct copy of MS documentation,
so I tend to put those off.

Miguel.
