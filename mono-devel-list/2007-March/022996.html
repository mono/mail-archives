<PRE>This is fantastic!  I had just been working on my own C++ binding in the
spirit of Boost-Python, but I think mine is not quite as far along as
yours so I'll gladly drop it and use yours.  Can you please tell us what
the license is for yours though?  It doesn't seem to say on the webpage
or in the source files.

&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I worked on a C++ binding library for mono, very close to
</I>&gt;<i> boost::python/luabind syntax, I had few minor modification to do in Mono
</I>&gt;<i> sources. The patch is attached.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was wondering if it was possible to include them in mono.
</I>&gt;<i> The missing thing was the possibility to bind a pointer argument to an internal
</I>&gt;<i> call. It is required in order to make all the C++ wrapper/proxy statically
</I>&gt;<i> linked through template metaprogramming.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (The only other possibility of doing it, using pointer to function member
</I>&gt;<i> removed the possibility to deduce type of function arguments, resulting in a
</I>&gt;<i> heavy syntax when declaring exported class in C++).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can check the binding library at : <A HREF="http://dev.kalimdor.org/entropia/node/10">http://dev.kalimdor.org/entropia/node/10</A>
</I>&gt;<i> It's still in development (like there is few non trivial to fix memory leak,
</I>&gt;<i> i.e. the wrapping code that should stay alive when mono is running), but right
</I>&gt;<i> now it works fine at exporting C++ class to C# and C# class to C++.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Later, I would like the registration code to auto-generate C# header.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, I still have a mono debugger for embedded mono (more or less in
</I>&gt;<i> pause, but if lot of people are interested in it, I could start working on it
</I>&gt;<i> again).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think with all that Mono could be a really great scripting language, offering
</I>&gt;<i> blazing speed compared to all the usual non-JIT script languages, with all the
</I>&gt;<i> advantages of C#.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sincerely,
</I>&gt;<i> Virgile Bello
