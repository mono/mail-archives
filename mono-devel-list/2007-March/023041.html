<PRE>Hi,

I just compiled the latest SVN head, and once again monotorrent works
perfectly (well, as perfectly as to be expected ;) ). No more crazy memory
usage, which means it was a mono bug after all. I just wish i knew what
exactly had gone wrong inside mono. For the amount of time i spent trying to
figure out what it was, i feel cheated that someone else fixed it before i
could ;)

Anyway, thanks for the help joe, i couldn't have gotten as far as i did
without you.

Alan.

</I>&gt;<i> Ok, i did a quick bit of testing on my code.

</I>&gt;<i> Firstly, the 54 instances of SocketAsyncResult do make sense. Typically

</I>&gt;<i> Therefore 54 instances of SocketAsyncResult would correspond to 54 open
</I>&gt;<i> connections, which is pretty standard stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Every call to socket.BeginXXX or socket.EndXXX goes through a
</I>&gt;<i> TCPConnection class, so i added a count there so i could see how many calls
</I>&gt;<i> to each BeginXXX and EndXXX method i actually make. The results were pretty
</I>&gt;<i> much as expected. There was always a difference between BeginReceive and
</I>&gt;<i> EndReceive pretty much equal to the number of sockets i have open. The
</I>&gt;<i> difference between BeginSend and EndSend was always close enough to zero,
</I>&gt;<i> which would also make sense as most messages i'm sending would only be a few
</I>&gt;<i> bytes in size. The difference between the BeginConnects and EndConnects is
</I>&gt;<i> always 5. This is right as i've set it so i only connect to at most 5 people
</I>&gt;<i> at any one instant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So i can rule out a bug in my code that's causing millions of BeginXXX's
</I>&gt;<i> without corresponding EndXXX's. There'd typically be between 80 and 120
</I>&gt;<i> Begin/EndReceive calls a second, which isn't that much really. A similar
</I>&gt;<i> amount for Begin/EndSend.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That leaves me with the question of how the hell a SocketAsyncResult is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 10 megs in size! The size of the largest single object in my entire code is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a 16kB byte[] buffer. If each SocketAsyncResult is 10 megabytes in size, i
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have to question the internal workings of mono, as i know from profiling my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; own code does *not* create objects anywhere near that size.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm going to do a bit of profiling to count how many socket BeginXXX
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; calls are made from my own code as compared to the EndXXX calls to see how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they match up.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is there any way of finding out what exactly is inside those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SocketAsyncResults that is 10 megs in size? I can verify that the exact same
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code running under Mono 1.2 and earlier does *not* exhibit the same
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; behavior, everything works fine. I only came across this bug after updating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; my mono installation to 1.2.3. This is why i think it's a mono bug,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; however i can't reproduce the problem in the form of an NUnit test.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks again,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Alan.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; That huge object array, in turn, is referenced by

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; readQ member.  So basically it means that the readQ member in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; System.Net.Socket.Socket is a huge Queue, which internally has an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; object array, which apparently has millions of SocketAsyncResult
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; objects inside.  So how those are being allocated?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; These objects are created a lot[...]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I got a little ahead of myself here: I'm obviously looking at the code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; for System.Net.Sockets.Socket here.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't know much about the Socket class and how the async IO
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; works, but it boils down to the fact that BeginReceive() is being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; called probably millions of times, but it doesn't look like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Complete()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; is being called enough (or possibly at all) to balance the load.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I actually noticed something else:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The object array in question has an average size of 10.6 megs, but it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; only holds 56 references to SocketAsyncResult at the time of this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; snapshot.  So this seems to indicate to me that the enqueues and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; dequeues do ultimately match up, but that the allocation pattern is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; bad and probably not interspersed.  That is,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; enqueue, enqueue, dequeue, dequeue, enqueue, enqueue, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; would mean that an array could be as small as 2 items and still work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; for N items, assuming a 1:1 match..  But if the pattern is instead,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; enqueue, enqueue, enqueue, enqueue, dequeue, dequeue, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; then it would have to be at least N.  Now pretend N is a million. :)
