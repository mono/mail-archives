<PRE>Hello,

As I worked on a C++ binding library for mono, very close to
boost::python/luabind syntax, I had few minor modification to do in Mono
sources. The patch is attached.

I was wondering if it was possible to include them in mono.
The missing thing was the possibility to bind a pointer argument to an internal
call. It is required in order to make all the C++ wrapper/proxy statically
linked through template metaprogramming.

(The only other possibility of doing it, using pointer to function member
removed the possibility to deduce type of function arguments, resulting in a
heavy syntax when declaring exported class in C++).

You can check the binding library at : <A HREF="http://dev.kalimdor.org/entropia/node/10">http://dev.kalimdor.org/entropia/node/10</A>
It's still in development (like there is few non trivial to fix memory leak,
i.e. the wrapping code that should stay alive when mono is running), but right
now it works fine at exporting C++ class to C# and C# class to C++.

Later, I would like the registration code to auto-generate C# header.

By the way, I still have a mono debugger for embedded mono (more or less in
pause, but if lot of people are interested in it, I could start working on it
again).

I think with all that Mono could be a really great scripting language, offering
blazing speed compared to all the usual non-JIT script languages, with all the
advantages of C#.

Sincerely,
Virgile Bello
