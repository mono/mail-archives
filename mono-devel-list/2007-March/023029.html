<PRE>Just to let you know since I did something very similiar for XBOX360 :
Even if I was able to make glib and then mono compile on XBOX360 (it was a bit
painful but doable) and it generated valid code to execute at runtime,
nevertheless memory protection against execution of user allocated area totally
prevented me to continue (you can check the blog post I did about that on
<A HREF="http://dev.kalimdor.org/entropia/">http://dev.kalimdor.org/entropia/</A>).
When I checked about using the interpreter, I've read somewhere that it wasn't
up to date anymore (maybe the info was too old and it's now up to date to
execute everything, anyone can confirm ?).
So, before going on, check that either the console can run unsigned code loaded
in memory (which I doubt since they tend to avoid that, since it would quickly
run into hacking of the console) or that mono interpreter is now working again.

Hope that helps, do not hesitate if you would like some other infos.

Cordially,
Virgile

Quoting John Matzen &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">john at ayxia.com</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> I'm trying to port the mono runtime to a device called a Wii.  Although it
</I>&gt;<i> has a PowerPC based CPU, I think getting it running with the interpreter
</I>&gt;<i> first would be the best approach rather than attempting to patch up the
</I>&gt;<i> existing PowerPC JIT, but I can not seem to find any documentation that
</I>&gt;<i> would describe how to begin fixing up the build system so that I can compile
</I>&gt;<i> it with the Wii's build tools (which are not gcc based).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any ideas on where to start?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!
</I>&gt;<i>
