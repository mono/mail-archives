<PRE>I ran it again, and came up with this (startling ;) ) figures for
allocations:

1) type=System.Runtime.Remoti...ing.MonoMethodMessage 4185 1024.1M 256603.6
0.5
     System.Threading.ThreadPool:QueueUserWorkItem

                    System.Timers.Timer:StartTimer


What the hell? 1 gig of allocations from a System.Timers.Timer? Whats going
on here!?


type=System.MonoType 2826  542.8M 201403.8   0.6

Half a gigabyte of System.MonoType's? What causes these to be allocated, and
what can i do to stop this?

Alan.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Alan,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; So, the thing is i can't track down what's causing the memory usage in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; monotorrent. I have no idea how to even start. I've tried using the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; built in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; profilers, but they require a graceful exit before they output their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; data,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and unfortunately i can't get them a graceful exit ;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would use the two external memory profilers for this: heap-buddy and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; heap-shot.  Both are available from Mono SVN and straightforward to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; build and use.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; heap-buddy is a summarizing profiler.  It collects allocation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; statistics while the program is running and writes out the aggregate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; info to a file which you analyze with a command-line tool after it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; finished running.  It is robust against your app exiting ungracefully.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The tool has 4 basic modes: summary, history, types and backtraces.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Summary gives you high-level info: how many objects/bytes were
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allocated, the final size of the heap, the number of GCs, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; History gives you a timeline of each heap resize and GC, telling you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the sizes of the heap, the number of objects and their size, and how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it changed over time.  You can see, for instance, that if your heap
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; resizes 5 times in a row without a GC all within 2 seconds that you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have a run away allocation pattern. :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Types will show you all the value types that have been created, how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; many total instances, the total bytes, the average size of one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instance, and the average age (ie, the number of GCs) it lived for.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you're dealing with runaway memory, this will tell you what it is.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The average age is good for finding memory leaks.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Backtraces is like types, except it's more granular.  It shows you the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; same info as types, but it breaks the types up by the call trace that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allocated them.  This is good when you're trying to find out what is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allocating all those damn strings. :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The other tool is heap-shot, which is a snapshotting profiler.  When
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you use it, you send SIGPROF to your running process which causes a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; file to be written out with all the information about allocations at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that point.  Afterward you can use the GUI to see where all the memory
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; has gone.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The basic display mode shows you all the types, along with the number
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of instances and the number of bytes these use.  This is pretty
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; similar to heap-buddy's types mode, except that it shows you the info
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for a snapshot in time, rather than the aggregate over the whole run
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the program.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The beauty of this tool is in the &quot;Reverse references&quot; mode, which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tells you what objects hold references to a given type.  So, if you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reverse the references for &quot;string&quot;, you might see that 100 instances
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of &quot;string&quot; are being referenced by 50 instances of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; System.IO.FileInfo, and are using 2k of memory.  As you drill down,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you might see reference leaks (like those damned static ArrayLists and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hashtables) that continually grow without bound.  These two tools
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (especially heap-shot) have helped us reduce memory usage in Beagle
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tremendously.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've blogged about both tools in the past (mostly heap-buddy).  You
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can search for them on <A HREF="http://joeshaw.org.">http://joeshaw.org.</A>  Lluis wrote heap-shot and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; has blogged about it as well.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Good luck,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Joe
