<PRE>Hi,

I finally managed to get heap-buddy working on my mac, it took a while, but
i got there ;) After testing monotorrent for a while with the debugger
enabled, nothing happened. Then i realised i wasn't using mono 1.2.3. A few
minutes later i fired up monotorrent using mono 1.2.3 and within seconds had
runaway memory usage. Here's the stats, maybe they'll make sense to someone,
or fire alarm bells for someone else:


I attached the seperate HeapBuddy reports to the email.

Alan.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, the thing is i can't track down what's causing the memory usage in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; monotorrent. I have no idea how to even start. I've tried using the
</I>&gt;<i> built in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; profilers, but they require a graceful exit before they output their
</I>&gt;<i> data,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and unfortunately i can't get them a graceful exit ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would use the two external memory profilers for this: heap-buddy and
</I>&gt;<i> heap-shot.  Both are available from Mono SVN and straightforward to
</I>&gt;<i> build and use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> heap-buddy is a summarizing profiler.  It collects allocation
</I>&gt;<i> statistics while the program is running and writes out the aggregate
</I>&gt;<i> info to a file which you analyze with a command-line tool after it's
</I>&gt;<i> finished running.  It is robust against your app exiting ungracefully.
</I>&gt;<i> :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The tool has 4 basic modes: summary, history, types and backtraces.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Summary gives you high-level info: how many objects/bytes were
</I>&gt;<i> allocated, the final size of the heap, the number of GCs, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> History gives you a timeline of each heap resize and GC, telling you
</I>&gt;<i> the sizes of the heap, the number of objects and their size, and how
</I>&gt;<i> it changed over time.  You can see, for instance, that if your heap
</I>&gt;<i> resizes 5 times in a row without a GC all within 2 seconds that you
</I>&gt;<i> have a run away allocation pattern. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Types will show you all the value types that have been created, how
</I>&gt;<i> many total instances, the total bytes, the average size of one
</I>&gt;<i> instance, and the average age (ie, the number of GCs) it lived for.
</I>&gt;<i> If you're dealing with runaway memory, this will tell you what it is.
</I>&gt;<i> The average age is good for finding memory leaks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Backtraces is like types, except it's more granular.  It shows you the
</I>&gt;<i> same info as types, but it breaks the types up by the call trace that
</I>&gt;<i> allocated them.  This is good when you're trying to find out what is
</I>&gt;<i> allocating all those damn strings. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The other tool is heap-shot, which is a snapshotting profiler.  When
</I>&gt;<i> you use it, you send SIGPROF to your running process which causes a
</I>&gt;<i> file to be written out with all the information about allocations at
</I>&gt;<i> that point.  Afterward you can use the GUI to see where all the memory
</I>&gt;<i> has gone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The basic display mode shows you all the types, along with the number
</I>&gt;<i> of instances and the number of bytes these use.  This is pretty
</I>&gt;<i> similar to heap-buddy's types mode, except that it shows you the info
</I>&gt;<i> for a snapshot in time, rather than the aggregate over the whole run
</I>&gt;<i> of the program.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The beauty of this tool is in the &quot;Reverse references&quot; mode, which
</I>&gt;<i> tells you what objects hold references to a given type.  So, if you
</I>&gt;<i> reverse the references for &quot;string&quot;, you might see that 100 instances
</I>&gt;<i> of &quot;string&quot; are being referenced by 50 instances of
</I>&gt;<i> System.IO.FileInfo, and are using 2k of memory.  As you drill down,
</I>&gt;<i> you might see reference leaks (like those damned static ArrayLists and
</I>&gt;<i> Hashtables) that continually grow without bound.  These two tools
</I>&gt;<i> (especially heap-shot) have helped us reduce memory usage in Beagle
</I>&gt;<i> tremendously.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've blogged about both tools in the past (mostly heap-buddy).  You
</I>&gt;<i> can search for them on <A HREF="http://joeshaw.org.">http://joeshaw.org.</A>  Lluis wrote heap-shot and
</I>&gt;<i> has blogged about it as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good luck,
</I>&gt;<i> Joe
