<PRE>Hi,

It's not the SocketAsyncResult itself that's 10 megs in size, it's the
object array that holds them that is 10 megs in size.

I think this is a good idea, and if that doesn't work out, I would use
Mono's tracing facility to see how often the methods I mentioned in my
last email were being called and in what order.  And if that doesn't
work, instrument the class libs themselves.

</I>
It's probably in the sockets code, so take a diff of
System.Net.Sockets.Socket between 1.2 and 1.2.3 and see what, if
anything changed.  If you can narrow it down to a specific change
between the releases, that will hopefully make it easier to write a
test case.
