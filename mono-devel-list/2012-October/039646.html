<PRE>Hello Leszek,

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> do not hesitate to contact me if you like, but the idea seems rather
</I>&gt;<i> vague to me.
</I>
I have a lot of work lately... I plan to write to polish Mono developers 
(and C#/.NET/Mono programmers) and ask whether you want to start the 
Mono conference in Poland.

&gt;<i> Mono development is currently lead by Xamarin which is also
</I>&gt;<i> open to accept ideas and patches from community. How this really works,
</I>&gt;<i> you can observe at github: <A HREF="https://github.com/mono/mono.git">https://github.com/mono/mono.git</A> The amount
</I>&gt;<i> of community driven patches probably increased with git and github as it
</I>&gt;<i> simplifies submitting and merging patches.
</I>
OK, but I often hear from my friends (programmers) that the Mono project 
is growing too slowly and because of their origin has some deficiencies 
that result from the lack of openness in Microsoft.

Mono community is much smaller than... C++ or Python community in Linux 
World.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the Microsoft side, the actions that helped Mono development were
</I>&gt;<i> open sourcing some parts of .NET (for example DLR, lately Entity
</I>&gt;<i> Framework) using useful licence (Apache 2.0, for that matter). One could
</I>&gt;<i> probably create wishlist containing another parts. For example Nuget,
</I>&gt;<i> which theoretically admits Mono existence, but support is severely
</I>&gt;<i> limited (for example try to create package).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I know (from my sources) that there is a chance for a lot more input 
from Microsoft to Mono.

&gt;<i> But the most important question here is: what is the role of the
</I>&gt;<i> foundation here?
</I>
I'm not a programmer, but I appreciate those who build openess. And Mono 
Project developers and Mono/C#/.NET programmers are this kind of people. 
Aegis foundation wants to support projects that build interoperability. 
C#/.NET and Mono Project is a gateway to programming for Windows Azure 
Cloud in Linux. C# is (apparently) simple and accessible programming 
language that can be taught in schools - young programmers can develop 
apps for both Windows and Linux environment.

This year Aegis foundation In cooperation with Microsoft has created a 
platform for innovation on Windows Azure. Platform was created to 
develop open solutions in a closed service.

Maybe, together, we can try to push Mono forward? Even if a little...

</PRE>
