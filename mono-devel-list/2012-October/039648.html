The conference may be interesting. At least I would probably like to
take part in it;)

</I>
I see your point. Situation is going better lately, for example Mono has
already been noticed and respected by many OSS C# projects like
ServiceStack, Nancy etc (which had their origins in .NET). The role of
MonoTouch (and Android) and its popularity may be important reason here.
Nonetheless it could always be better ;)
