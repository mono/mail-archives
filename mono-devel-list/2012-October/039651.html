&gt;<i> We are investigating running mono to enable C# as a computing language in

</I>&gt;<i>

Mono only uses one extra thread for finalization. Making all code that runs
on the finalizer thread happen on the main thread would be challenging.



&gt;<i> To get even more exotic, and I suppose this would require a patch to mono
</I>&gt;<i> itself, we would want the memory allocation to be customized to take
</I>&gt;<i> advantage of the NUMA on the machine, allocating memory only which is
</I>&gt;<i> advantageous to the socket on which our current process is running.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Can't a numactl wrapper do all of this?

Finally, we may want to tweak the parameters sent to the LLVM compiler to
&gt;<i> optimize for runtime speed, even at the cost of very slow compilation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Tweaking llvm parameters require changing mono's source code and pretty
much voids any guarantees that the resulting code will work.
A lot of LLVM optimizations for some reasons produce bad code when used
with mono. Zoltan can better explain this, I guess.


Where do we start in understanding the above changes and whether they are
&gt;<i> already supported? The documentation for LLVM and the garbage collectors is
</I>&gt;<i> excellent at describing the high level approach, but I am at a bit of a
</I>&gt;<i> loss when understanding how to tweak the details.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
For such a thing, you need to dig into the runtime source code as those
internals are not documented.
