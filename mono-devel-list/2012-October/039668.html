<PRE>Personally, I would like to see mono-winforms finished -- the web page (<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/WinForms">http://www.mono-project.com/WinForms</A>) suggests that support for WinForms 1.1 and 2.0 is done, and is now in a maintenance/bug-fixing state, but if my experience is any indication, it needs a LOT of bug fixing. &#160;I used to spend my precious time-off fixing mono-winforms bugs, and hope I have the time and energy to do more in the future, but so much needs to be done.

While we're at it, I'd like to see mwf-designer (<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/WinForms_Designer">http://www.mono-project.com/WinForms_Designer</A>) completed too. &#160;The last time I tried to use it, it crashed left and right.

Maybe you could start by going through the bug-report database :-)

Subject: [Mono-dev] Do You (Mono developers) have some wish list?
 
Hello again,
As I write in previous thread, Our fundation is thinking how we can support Mono project. We are talking about Mono project with MS and with other dvelopers. And question is:

Do You have some wish list for Microsoft or for developers at all (developers able to participate in Mono)?

We are trying to build such a list and when it will be done, we will try to encourage MS and devs to cooperate.
