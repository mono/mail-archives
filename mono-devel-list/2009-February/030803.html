<PRE>Generic type variance has landed in gmcs SVN [1]. This is a C# 4
feature. It can be enabled by passing -langversion:future. While type
variance is cool, I want to talk about -langversion:future. I see this
as being a sentinel langversion for features as yet unreleased by
Microsoft. Those features could be announced additions to the language
(as with generic type variance, or the &quot;dynamic&quot; keyword) but they
need not be. Mcs has done an excellent job of tracking the official C#
language, and it will continue to do so, but the Mono project has a
world-class compiler entirely at its disposal. We need not confine
ourselves to the blessed specs of Microsoft or Ecma. We could &quot;trick
out&quot; C#, indulging in sugars of our own device, so long as we keep our
creations in -langversion:future. Those projects which are willing to
sacrifice compatibility with csc in order to partake of our forbidden
fruit can write code in this New C#. This C#++. This
-langversion:future.

To be clear, I am not advocating VM changes. Anything to come out of
this compiler would remain binary-compatible with the .NET runtime.
Language features and APIs only. I have loads of ideas - I actually
keep a list where I jot down every language feature idea I come up
with - but I want to hear from the list. Do you like the idea? Do you
have concerns? Do you have a language feature you've always wanted?

I will start the ball rolling with a simple feature:

Problem: While the 'typeof' keyword is very convenient for getting
Type objects, it is much more difficult to get any other kind of
reflection data. For example, to get a MethodInfo object, one usually
does:

&gt;<i> static readonly MethodInfo methodInfo = typeof(Foo).GetMethod(&quot;Bar&quot;, new Type [] { typeof(string), typeof(int) });
</I>
Not only is this an eyesore, but we have a method name in a string. If
I refactor that method, I will have to remember to update this code as
well.

Solution: The &quot;reflect&quot; keyword. This is like the typeof keyword, but
you can use it to reflect upon anything.

Examples:

&gt;<i> Type fooType = reflect(Foo);
</I>&gt;<i> MethodInfo barMethod1 = reflect(Foo.Bar(string));
</I>&gt;<i> MethodInfo barMethod2 = reflect(Foo.Bar(string,int));
</I>&gt;<i> FieldInfo batField = reflect(Foo.bat);
</I>&gt;<i> PropertyInfo bazProperty = reflect(Foo.Baz);
</I>&gt;<i> ConstructorInfo fooCtor1 = reflect(new Foo());
</I>&gt;<i> ConstructorInfo fooCtor2 = reflect(new Foo(string));
</I>&gt;<i> ConstructorInfo staticFooCtor = reflect(static Foo());
</I>&gt;<i> EventInfo fooEvent = reflect(Foo.Changed);
</I>
And if I refactor any of these members or types, my IDE will update
this code as well.

Your turn.
