I really like this proposal. (Although I see why the people is worried
about maintaining the features, this may be worth it because it may be
an interesting incubator of proposals to Anders H. for next versions,
no?). I have a big pile of ideas that I was gathering in order to blog
as a 'C# wishlist', so I could contribute them to this discussion.

My suggestion is to use the wiki hosted in mono-project. We could create
a page with an index with links to all ideas (sub-pages). Every idea
could be voted up (+1) or down (-1) by the community, giving comments or
feedback about the vote, maybe causing the idea to mutate.

And after some time, the best ideas could be then created in Bugzilla
and tracked there...

Regards,
