Swing would be intersting... and it also handles cross platform easer
than winforms... though I would look into something like SWT.... the
api is already avalible... for both so a clean room clone could be
made of both.

&gt;<i> well, I still don't know if anyone would be so interested in the idea, but
</I>&gt;<i> the basic idea has more or less boiled down to this:
</I>&gt;<i> it would be potentially useful if someone would go and port Swing (and
</I>maybe
&gt;<i> also parts of AWT) to Mono.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> there is an implementation located in GNU ClassPath, which could be
</I>used as
&gt;<i> a starting point if anyone were interested (and can tolerate the plain
</I>GPL,
&gt;<i> although an alternative liscense would be preferable I would think...).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> another possible advantage of Swing is that the API already exists and is
</I>&gt;<i> well-established, likely making it be less uncertain (trying to win
</I>support
&gt;<i> for some obscure and unknown API, ...), as well as making it much
</I>easier to
&gt;<i> specify and implement (the edge cases would be necessary variations
</I>between
&gt;<i> the Java framework and .NET framework, ...).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> it could also exist almost purely inside managed code, potentially only
</I>&gt;<i> needing the use of native code for the Canvas (could be implemented as
</I>a set
&gt;<i> of interfaces, or as an abstract class), allowing some level of
</I>independence
&gt;<i> from the underlying VM (and, in particular, not require necessarily
</I>linking
&gt;<i> against 3rd party GUI libraries...). so, the GUI-proper can be made
</I>&gt;<i> self-contained...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> why it matters IMO, is that there are some things that, from what I am
</I>&gt;<i> aware, GTK and friends has not done in the past (such as rendering the
</I>GUI's
&gt;<i> to GL textures and allowing the user to supply their own mouse and
</I>keyboard
&gt;<i> input into the backend, ...). but, then again, it is also worth noting
</I>that
&gt;<i> I have not messed with GTK much in years (nor have I really investigated
</I>&gt;<i> GTK# in any real detail).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> my primary reasons for not using GTK much being:
</I>&gt;<i> it is not nearly so workable on Windows (PITA to get built, ...);
</I>&gt;<i> does not mix well with my general approach to application architecture;
</I>&gt;<i> does not play ideally with OpenGL-based apps (and probably worse with
</I>&gt;<i> DirectX / Direct3D, though I don't really use these personally as they are
</I>&gt;<i> not available on Linux...);
</I>&gt;<i> ..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OTOH, Swing, would allow user-supplied &quot;Canvases&quot;, which would allow
</I>&gt;<i> render-to-texture and like, ... (and does not look like it will try to
</I>&gt;<i> hijack the main-loop or other such things...).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> looking into it, MS had also ported Swing to .NET in the past, but had it
</I>&gt;<i> under a &quot;non-commercial use only&quot; liscense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> but, alas, my looking into all of this has been only superficial, and I am
</I>&gt;<i> not likely to work on such a project (at least at this point in time),
</I>since
&gt;<i> it would be &quot;outside my area&quot;...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> in my case, I may well (eventually) start making use of Swing in my
</I>&gt;<i> projects, but this will be mostly because my Java support is likely to be
</I>&gt;<i> functional well before my .NET support is, and probably also because I
</I>could
&gt;<i> pump it into a GL texture, which would allow it to play better with my
</I>&gt;<i> existing overall project design... (likely render-to-texture and draw the
</I>&gt;<i> GUI as an overlay, ...).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (for the time being, I have my own GL-based GUI framework in C-land, but I
</I>&gt;<i> don't really expect this to be long-lived...).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> however, I am also aware that this may not mix with the politics /
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;best-interest&quot; of the existing community (which I would guess has a lot
</I>&gt;<i> invested already in GTK# and similar?...), and so I will probably not
</I>press
&gt;<i> the issue much further.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> or such...
