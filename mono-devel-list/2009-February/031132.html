<PRE>Attached is a patch for <A HREF="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=477447.">https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=477447.</A>
Would someone mind reviewing/applying it? I would attach the patch to the
bug itself, but I can&#185;t access Novell&#185;s Bugzilla right now.

Here&#185;s the text that I would have added as a comment:

I am still unable to create a concise test case that exposes this bug, but I
have supplied a patch that fixes the issue.

It seems that, in certain cases, an AnonymousMethodStorey used by an
anonymous delegate may not always be available in the AnonymousMethodStorey
associated with that delegate. The attached patch detects this situation and
attempts to compose an expression that accesses the desired
AnonymousMethodStorey indirectly.

I know that it may be a tough sell to get code committed for which no test
case can be supplied, but a review of my patch should reveal that the only
code paths affected are those in which the compiler would have crashed,
anyway, so there shouldn't be much danger in applying it.
