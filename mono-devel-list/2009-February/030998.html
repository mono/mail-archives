<PRE>Hey.
&gt;<i> Take the reverse situation, why would Mono devs care on supporting 
</I>&gt;<i> application X because some users would like to run X on Mono ?
</I>It depends on what the mono team sees as the goal of mono.
If it is to provide a nice programming environment for linux programmers 
to make linux applications,  then no reason to change.
If it also is to make it easy for .net applications to run on linux, and 
to have windows .net developers try mono, and adopt mono as one of their 
platforms,
then it would make sense to cahnge.

&gt;<i> Also, all of the applications cited are open-source AND free software 
</I>&gt;<i> which allow you to patch them freely.
</I>They are all opensource, and I have submitted patches (except for xunit, 
upcomig). The reason I bring this up is not to make my life easier. I can
make all these tools work for me and move on.  I bring it up because I 
feel mono is a really great project, and I would love to make it work more
out of the box, even for programs that sometimes cross the line of what 
they &quot;are allowed&quot; to be doing.

You could also say that from the 3 projects I would like to use on 
mono,  100% of them didn't work because of this.
That means there are probably a lot of  other projects out there using 
this as well, that don't know about mono, and didn't receive
a patch for me to provide mono compatibility.

Anyway, I think most arguments for and against have been made, and from 
this point the mono team should just do what it
feels is right.

Bye, Lucas
</PRE>
