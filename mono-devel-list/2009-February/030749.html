It's pretty common practice for there to be a README file in each of 
those areas under trunk.  There are probably documents explaining the 
main Mono modules, but I doubt there's anything that documents EVERY 
module under trunk (since many of them are just personal experiments, etc).

Hopefully somebody else can answer the next part of your question.
