I'd be very cautious with that idea. I've been told enough that mcs is
a `production` compiler :)

I mean, sure it's fun to experiment language changes and improvement.
But who decides what will go in and what not? And when it's in, who is
going to maintain it? Most people that will work on a patch for the
fun of it won't maintain the feature for a long time. If it's
perfectly ok for a feature that is needed, or for some libraries, it's
not really the case of mcs. Then it triggers some questions, like what
if a change to the parser (or some place else) for a `future` feature
gets in the way of a fix for the normal version of mcs?

Anyway, am not completely against the idea, I already wrote about how
I'd like to have a more extensible mcs, but in the current state of
affairs, again, I'd very cautious.
