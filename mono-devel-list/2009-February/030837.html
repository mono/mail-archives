<PRE>It sounds like the general reaction is cautiously favorable. New
language features would be nice, but they would require a commitment
to maintenance. As I see it, whether we are willing to invest ongoing
effort in a feature depends on the strength of the feature. A
sufficiently &quot;killer&quot; feature will motivate its own upkeep.

So what is (are) the killer feature(s)? I would be interested in
organizing a forum for proposing and discussing language features. If
for no other reason than as an excuse to talk about language design
with smart people. This forum could start as an informal bake-off of
ideas and brainstorms. If momentum builds behind a particular feature,
we could formalize a proposal for its inclusion in the compiler. This
allows the exploration of many ideas without the looming specter of
feature-creep.

If other people are interested in geeking out over language features,
I suggest we get ourselves a little organized. We could hold forth
right here, on this list, or we could create our own Google Group.
Bugzilla is maybe another option. Maybe. Thoughts?
