<PRE>I just want the compiler to inline the functions in IL in a similar way
that a C++ compiler would do it, I know that the &quot;correct&quot; way is for
the JIT to do this, but this has other semantic problems that need to be
overcome. In the short term however having the ability to do this easily
through the compiler would be a boon.

So I'm not expecting the C# compiler to output anything other than IL
but just eliminate the calling overhead and not relying on the JIT to do
the inlining.

I'm not sure how you expect this to work.  Inlining is the
responsibility of the JIT and there is no way for GMCS to force the
JIT to inline something without a change in the JIT.
