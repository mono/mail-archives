<PRE>
Running a two-week old SVN HEAD version of Mono and have been using the full
AOT compilation feature as well as the mono_aot_only mode of running the
system so that I can execute managed code on the iPhone. I have been
successful in doing so and have been instantiating and executing various
managed code methods to verify the functionality.

Last night I fully AOT compiled an assembly that has a method with some
generics code in it. I basically add a few strings to a List&lt;string&gt;
collection. When running this method an assert was triggered and looking at
the stack trace it seemed to have stopped when it tried to compile a
runtime_invoke_void_* method (not sure about the exact name of this
method)... which was created as an &quot;extra&quot; method when previously compiling
the generic code. 

Now, the assert was triggered because I was running with mono_aot_only =
TRUE but the code was trying to invoke a JIT compilation. 

Does this mean that generics isn't supported right now for full AOT
compilation? or does it mean that I haven't initialized the system correctly
(either at compile time or at runtime)?

If it is not supported are there any goals for when this would be available? 

Thanks,
