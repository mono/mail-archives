If you want to contribute to mono, only 2-4 projects are relevant:

<A HREF="http://mono-project.com/Compiling_Mono_From_SVN">http://mono-project.com/Compiling_Mono_From_SVN</A>

The incubator of .NET 3.x features (not mentioned on this
wiki page) is called &quot;olive&quot;. Note that, IIRC, the repository
protocol has changed from http to svn, so the links mentioned
on the wiki page must start with <A HREF="svn://.">svn://.</A>
