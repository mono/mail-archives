<PRE>Hey Miguel,
&gt;<i> It seems to me that talking to upstream developers and get them to 
</I>&gt;<i> provide a more robust implementation from the get-go would be a much 
</I>&gt;<i> better outcome.   Have them probe for .NET version, fall back to Mono 
</I>&gt;<i> and if none of those are available, gracefully degrade the functionality.
</I>This should defenitely happen, and we're talking to the upstream 
developers to deal with this situation in a better way.

The main theme of my message is not how to get these 3 projects from 
running on mono, but if we can make the N others
that we do not know about run on mono as well.

I'm not advocating for _not_ implementing more proper behaviour upstream.
&gt;<i> I did not get the feeling (or maybe it is part of my lost email) that 
</I>&gt;<i> I have heard the &quot;againsts&quot; yet.
</I>So far I think it can be summarized as:

1)  It takes nonzero time, and there are a zillion more important things 
to do.
2)  It could break projects that are mono-only and rely on the same hack.
3)  In the original comment on the bugzilla issue, it was noted that the 
&quot;field is shared with the runtime&quot;, and that
     that would make a fix ugly.

I actually think #1 is a good argument against,  #2 is not very likely, 
but not totally impossible either, and to what extent #3 is a problem,
I don't know.

Bye, Lucas
