<PRE>All,

 

Not sure the best way to submit this, please correct me if there is a
better way to do this (via bugzilla?)

 

I encountered a problem when casting a long to an IntPtr, which is
something we have ended up doing a lot (we want to keep binary assembly
compatibility between x86 and x64, only changing the native code on the
different architectures). We encountered a problem with Mono as there
has been a check introduced into the IntPtr constructor from a long,
this is checking the range of the long to ensure it is in range,
unfortunately the check is incorrect. A long can easily hold from
Int32.MinValue to UInt32.MaxValue (and not Int32.MaxValue as it
currently in there).

 

See attached patch (contributed under the MIT X11 license) to introduce
the one extra character that makes the range check correct.

 

Can I also say that I think the check should really be in a Debug.Assert
so that it disappears in non-Debug versions, the check is good for
sanity checking but superfluous on released code.

 

Regards

 

Russell
