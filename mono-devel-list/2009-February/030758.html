<PRE>Hi Jon &amp; List,

Here's another take at this implemented as you suggested.

Couple of questions though:

&gt;<i> 1. Somehow find out which is preferable for &quot;normal&quot; UnixSignal usage:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   a. One pipe/UnixSignal instance for the lifetime of the UnixSignal.
</I>&gt;<i>   b. One pipe/UnixSignal instance for the lifetime of a WaitAny()
</I>call.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm assuming &quot;normal&quot; is that a UnixSignal will last for the life of
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> application; that is, UnixSignal instances won't be short lived.
</I>&gt;<i> Meanwhile, I'd expect WaitAny() to be comparatively infrequent, but
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> less clues about how it's used in practice.
</I>
We're using SIGRT* raised a bunch of times a second for the update tick
of a game server, I'm talking 20-30Hz. For our use case I think a) is
preferable, though I've implemented this as b) as suggested just now. 

What are your thoughts?

&gt;<i> You might need to change wait_for_any() to actually perform error
</I>&gt;<i> checking on the read(h-&gt;read_fd, &amp;c, 1) call, as this could now error
</I>&gt;<i> if
</I>&gt;<i> multiple threads are calling WaitAny().
</I>
What kind of error conditions are you expecting in this instance?

And finally, here's some comments on mph_int*:

Obviously the signal handler can be executing concurrently with the
other functions in signal.c that are guarded by the mutex; to keep a
consistent view of pipecnt in the signal handler I have used atomics:

1. There does not appear to be an equivalent to InterlockedIncrement in
the glib functions (returning the value after atomic inc), so there is
code in setup_pipes that would race if it were re-entrant. It isn't
re-entrant due to the global mutex being held but this needs tidying to
avoid confusion. Effectively, I need to: if
(InterlockedIncrement(pipecnt) == 1) { setup pipes }. 

2. Conversely, I needed an atomic decrement. Having looked at the glib
functions I could only find g_atomic_int_dec_and_test in 2.4. Is this
OK, or is there an a g_atomic_int_dec ? This is to achieve: if
(InterlockedDecrement(pipecnt) == 0) { teardown pipes }.
g_atomic_int_dec_and_test clearly does the job, but it's a little
inconsistent with InterlockedDecrement with respect to the mph_int*
macros.

Cheers
-Tim
