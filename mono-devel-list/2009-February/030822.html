<PRE>Yes but this is only for a very small class of functions that we know
will work correctly within these constraints... its not for everyone I
know, but it is still a feature that we would like to have.

Apart from the fact that if you're inlining a method from a different
assembly by &quot;importing&quot; it you're not only depending on the interface
of the assembly not to change in the future, but also on the
implementation, which is a very bad idea.
