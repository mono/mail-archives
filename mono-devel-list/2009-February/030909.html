<PRE>well, I am not THAT worried/fussy, but it is better to steer clear of known issues, and if there is an unintended patent issue, people are far less likely to notice if it is somewhere unrelated to the context of the original claim...

  The only good response to that email is summarised pretty well by this blogpost.

  <A HREF="http://www.jprl.com/Blog/archive/development/mono/2009/Jan-19.html">http://www.jprl.com/Blog/archive/development/mono/2009/Jan-19.html</A>

  The only addition I'll make is to ask this question: Have you ever created/distributed a CD which contains a hyperlink? If so, you've just infringed a patent!

  If something so trivial can be patented, than I think it's safe enough to assume that if your application is more than 1000 LOC, you've unwittingly infringed on at least one patent. So if you really are worried about patents, then you really should not be a software developer.

  Alan.
