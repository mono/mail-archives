#2 is more likely than you think. There are applications out there that
employ such hacks with proper safeguards. Such a change would make 2-3
improperly coded applications work, but it would risk breaking n other
applications that are correctly written to check for .Net and Mono! (though
&quot;correctly&quot; is a bit stretched when talking about such hacks).

Another issue is that such a change invites the wrong mentality: &quot;My
application relies on undocumented .Net internals and does not run on Mono.
I blame Mono.&quot; This is just plain wrong.

A fifth issue is that undocumented .Net behavior may change at any time. If
Mono is patched, these applications will remain open to future breakage. If
the applications are patched, no such danger exists.

This bug should be taken to the developers of the original application.
