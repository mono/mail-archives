<PRE>I love the iphone.  I recently got one (my first apple computer if you think about it).  Now, I would like to develop my own applications for the iphone, but I do not know where to start.  I have done an internet search and found stuff, but there is nothing that can get a C# developer who is used to windows to use and develop iphone apps on a Mac in C#.  

What would be the minimum requirements for a computer to develop iphone applications with?  Will a Mac Mini with Intel running Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard suffice?  How much RAM and Hard Disk space do I need?

I would rather write these iphone apps in C# than Objective-C.  This is where Mono comes in mind.  I believe you can use static compilation in Mono using AOT compilation and a tool called Linker.

I've seen a tool from unity3d, but that tool is expensive.  After shelling out for the iphone, a mac mini, the apple developer program, i don't think there will be much left.  Unity Indie for $200 and the iPhone Publishing Basic for $400 for a total of $600.

So, what does one need to build applications for the iphone in C#?
What tools must I install on the Mac (the iphone SDK and Mono of course) to do this?  What steps must I take to build these apps?

Thanks,
Daniel
