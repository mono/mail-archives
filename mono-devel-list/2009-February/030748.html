<PRE>
Apologies to those who have an intimate understanding of the SVN repository.

I have been considering helping with developing mono, but the main
inhibition at this stage is to know where to find things, becuase the SVN
repository has sooo many folders. I don't know where to start to find what.

So I was wondering if anyone can point me to a document/page that explains
the purpose of each directory under /trunk, that would basically give me an
orientation to the repository layout. Or if such a document doesn't exist,
could someone consider making such a document? - I don't expect a huge
thing, possibly just a few short words to explain the purpose of each
directory, e.g. what is the purpose of &quot;DemoLib&quot;, what is the purpose of
&quot;Deveel.Pim&quot;, what is the purpose of &quot;Dumbarton&quot;, etc.

On a related issue, is there somewhere an &quot;Orientation to helping develop
mono&quot; page, which gives a brief explanation of how to get involved, because
I couldn't find that either. All I could find was
<A HREF="http://mono-project.com/Mono_Contribution_HOWTO">http://mono-project.com/Mono_Contribution_HOWTO</A> which doesn't really explain
such things as what part(s) of the repository should be checked out to do
basic things, or a policy on where things are to be checked-in, etc.

Thankyou.
