<PRE>Rodrigo,

 

IntPtr objects are very awkward to use and optimise badly, we unwrap an
IntPtr to an internal type called Ptr, that is an enum based on a long,
as this generates much better code within loops and generally inlines
better (on both Mono and MS.Net) we also keep this as a long so that we
have the same assembly on both x86 and x64 (which limits our testing).

 

IntPtr is also fairly horrible to work with when you are doing any maths
when working with memory operations (which we are doing a lot).

 

Now this is not a problem and works very well on both Mono and MS.NET ,
when this patch is applied.

 

I do not see the objection to this patch as an IntPtr  can safely hold
values that are over 2Gb and they are valid addresses, also converting
from a pointer to a long does not sign extend it, which is perfectly
valid and at times you do want to convert back to an IntPtr.

 

This is a perfectly safe and sensible patch.

 

Russell

Russel,

I think the issue is that you're using long to represent pointers when
you should be using IntPtr only.

2009/2/11 &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">russell.kay at realtimeworlds.com</A>&gt;

All,

 

Not sure the best way to submit this, please correct me if there is a
better way to do this (via bugzilla?)

 

I encountered a problem when casting a long to an IntPtr, which is
something we have ended up doing a lot (we want to keep binary assembly
compatibility between x86 and x64, only changing the native code on the
different architectures). We encountered a problem with Mono as there
has been a check introduced into the IntPtr constructor from a long,
this is checking the range of the long to ensure it is in range,
unfortunately the check is incorrect. A long can easily hold from
Int32.MinValue to UInt32.MaxValue (and not Int32.MaxValue as it
currently in there).

 

See attached patch (contributed under the MIT X11 license) to introduce
the one extra character that makes the range check correct.

 

Can I also say that I think the check should really be in a Debug.Assert
so that it disappears in non-Debug versions, the check is good for
sanity checking but superfluous on released code.

 

Regards

 

Russell
