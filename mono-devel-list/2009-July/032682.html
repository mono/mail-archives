<PRE>I decided to give xbuild a try today and was pretty impressed on how well it was working. I have a project with a few .config files checked into revision control that wind up being read-only. When I run xbuild it errors out trying to overwrite a read-only file from a previous run in the output directories. I'm not if this is a bug or not. I am owner of target file and modebits are all -r--r--r--.
