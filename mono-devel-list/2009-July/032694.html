<PRE>But it's a pretty straight forward use case. I sync my code from revision control. In this particular case, I'm using perforce. Perforce brings files down from the depot read-only. To edit, you must &quot;check out&quot; files. My log configuration is sync'd up read only. I build and the file gets moved into the output directory. I build again and it fails. I cannot confirm how msbuild on windows is dealing with this, but it definitely allows it.

My opinion is that since this is not some random file, but a file that the build is being asked to create, it should get overwritten. It's certainly a usability issue.
