<PRE>Hello,

So, just to make everything clear beforehand, the whole ParallelFx patch
only add new classes and so, apart from the build system, no legacy files is
touched.

At first, the process I was thinking of about the whole patch is that people
interested to review would apply it directly to a clean local tree, be able
to build it as a whole, run the unit tests on their box see if they pass and
then check more in depth what part they are interested in and comment on
that (maybe via a reviewboard-like application to avoid polluting the list
?).

Miguel seems to have the same idea as me apart that I commit the new types
directly instead of providing a patch.

What I'm afraid with Rodrigo proposal after thinking a bit is that it's
going to be messy tracking down each small patch comments thread, will
probably take months if it's a global review and sometimes hard to do
because a patch may depends on another (again, my feeling on the matter).

About the source place, I was advised to let the 4.0 files in System.Core
and just make corlib.dll.sources link to them. Does everybody agree ? (there
is concern about the troublesome work that will be needed with Subversion if
the files have to be moved back to corlib folder afterwards).

Well, in the end, I'm a bit confused on how exactly do this.

&gt;<i> Hello J&#233;r&#233;mie,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    I would like to complement the other posts on this thread.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    In general, if we only have new classes that are being added and do
</I>&gt;<i> not touch other parts of the code, we should be OK in just checking in
</I>&gt;<i> the files into SVN.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    It would be ideal though if you could actually place the files in
</I>&gt;<i> the real assembly in your local system (mscorlib.dll) and make sure that
</I>&gt;<i> the result builds, this would at least guarantee that you do not depend
</I>&gt;<i> on things like LINQ.
</I>&gt;<i>
