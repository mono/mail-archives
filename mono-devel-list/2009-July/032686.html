<PRE>2009/7/27 J&#233;r&#233;mie Laval &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">jeremie.laval at gmail.com</A>&gt;

&gt;<i> Hello folks,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ParallelFx[0] is a library designed to help programmers write more easily
</I>&gt;<i> parallel and concurrent code on .NET platform. As part of Summer of Code
</I>&gt;<i> (this year and last year), I coded a free reimplementation of this library
</I>&gt;<i> to work on top of Mono.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Up until now, the code was living in mono-soc-2008 repository[1] hosted on
</I>&gt;<i> Google Code. Since .NET 4 beta has been released (and as it bundles
</I>&gt;<i> ParallelFx into the BCL [2]) it seems about time to move the development of
</I>&gt;<i> ParallelFx into Mono trunk with the 4.0 profile.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The patch (<A HREF="http://is.gd/1P4n7">http://is.gd/1P4n7</A>) contains 2 of the 3 parts of ParallelFx :
</I>&gt;<i> the TPL (Task Parallel Library) and DSC (Data Structures for Coordination).
</I>&gt;<i> Modified/added namespaces are `System.Threading', `System.Collections.Concurrent'
</I>&gt;<i> and `System.Threading.Tasks'.  The last component, PLinq, is working but
</I>&gt;<i> hasn't yet been ported to the 4.0 API and thus isn't suitable for
</I>&gt;<i> integration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's quite a big patch but I would very much welcome any input on it and
</I>&gt;<i> especially if it's ok for inclusion. As you will see, some parts are still
</I>&gt;<i> unfinished but the point of the patch is to move the code into trunk and to
</I>&gt;<i> avoid duplicate efforts by other Mono developers who would think the code
</I>&gt;<i> isn't existing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>The patch is just ridiculously huge to be reviewed. No one will even bother
with a 12 thousand monster. I suggest you to split them into smaller chunks
so we can discuss about them. My take is that you should start with the
trivial bits (such new intertaces) which can be reviewed quite fast, then
move to simple ones like new exceptions and other simple types and do the
complex parts later.

A quick check shows a bunch of interfaces and exceptions. There is some junk
like class/System.Core/System.Threading.Tasks/Internal/.svn/entries that
doesn't belong to a patch.

The patch, as is, can't be reviewed as it's too big to have someone make
sense of it. And even after comments, it will be hard to review how those
were applied.

So here is my suggestion, can we start with System.Collections.Concurrent?
Send a patch per new public type and we can start reviewing it.
