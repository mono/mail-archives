<PRE>Hello,
 
Can anybody help me to understand why, on simple performance tests, I see so
different results between .NET and Mono on various Linux platforms? Are my
tests incorrect? Did I have no luck and simply fall on some
methods/functionality better implemented by MS? And why is there such a
difference between Suse and Debian for the IPAddress dictionary?
 
Any help appreciated (please, no trolling, no political debate - just ideas
about how to improve things or ideas to point out methodology errors I would
have made in my tests)
 
Regards,
Lionel
 
 
 
A few hints on how I did my tests:
- the OS are: a bare XP SP3, a bare OpenSuse (kernel 2.6.27), a Debian with
a lightened kernel (2.6.30) - &quot;bare&quot; = the OS is up-to-date but no other
software installed
- all OS were running as vmware guest (in vm workstation 6.5) with two
&quot;cpus&quot; (dual-core T7200) and 512Mo of RAM

- Mono version was 2.4.2.3 on Suse, and 2.5 (compiled from SVN r140059) on
Debian. .NET version is 3.5
- On Suse and Debian, I both run the tests with the exe compiled with csc
(.net) and with the exe compiled with gmcs - the results were the same.
 
You'll find attached the sample code I used - I test basically a dictionary
of int, a dictionary of IPAddress and the IPAddress.ToString method. The
duration of the test (in millisec are:
 
int32 Dictionary test
4812 DotNet
9493 Mono on light Debian
9815 Mono on Suse
 

IPAddress Dictionary test
13500 DotNet
29533 Mono on light Debian
41732 Mono on Suse
 

IPAddress.ToString test
2453 DotNet
16665 Mono on light Debian
17747 Mono on Suse
