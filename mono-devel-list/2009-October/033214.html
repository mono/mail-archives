<PRE>Yes, the testing conditions were the same for all virtual machines (xp,
suse, debian): nothing else was running (and only the base service/daemon -
no web server, no database and so on: just the bare OS). Besides, I ran the
tests several times and the figures were stable.

What is the background noise on the CPU load in the VMWare environments? Are
all the CPUs running at the same spare capcity, and the same/similar CPU
utilisation during the tests, or are tasks running in the background, system
updates etc.. on the Linuxes that's eating resources?

Cheers,

Euan.

You're benching different Mono versions. Mono 2.4 was branched
in January, whereas r140059 is pretty up-to-date.



 
Besides, while measuring Dictionary&lt;T, K&gt; performance has some relation to
actual program performance, I doubt whether anyone will call
IPAdress.ToString() often enough to even notice the speed difference...
