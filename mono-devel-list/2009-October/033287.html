<PRE>Hey,

Unity Technologies creates a game development tool called Unity. Mono is 
an essential component of Unity.

We are looking for a mono runtime hacker to join our team, who can help 
us achieve the following:

- more quickly be able to support new platforms by taking care of 
porting mono to the platforms in question

- reducing mono's memory and size footprints.
Many games can be developed using only a small subset of what Mono 
provides. Currently they still have to pay for a large part of the stuff 
they don't use. We want to get into a situation where games that don't 
use much, can get a lower footprint.

You can work remotely, or choose to work at one of our offices 
(Copenhagen, San Francisco, Vilnius, Kaunas, London)

You can expect a relaxed working atmosphere at Unity. We're a bunch of 
hackers that just love creating cool tech, and care about having a work 
environments in which developers feel comfortable, and can be productive.

Please feel free to contact me directly at <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">lucas at unity3d.com</A>, if you're 
interested, or would like some more information.

Bye,

   Lucas

</PRE>
