What is the background noise on the CPU load in the VMWare environments? Are all the CPUs running at the same spare capcity, and the same/similar CPU utilisation during the tests, or are tasks running in the background, system updates etc.. on the Linuxes that's eating resources?

Cheers,

Euan.

You're benching different Mono versions. Mono 2.4 was branched

in January, whereas r140059 is pretty up-to-date.


 Besides, while measuring Dictionary&lt;T, K&gt; performance has some relation to actual program performance, I doubt whether anyone will call IPAdress.ToString() often enough to even notice the speed difference...
