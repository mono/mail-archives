<PRE>Hi guys!

After some time of inactivity, due to the growing responsibilities and
duties at my regular job, and the failure of my previous main project
(Minosse RDBMS, some of you might remember it...), recently I decided
to restart developing.

Last day I released the first sources of the project DeveelDB, a fully
featured SQL-compliant relational database management system, purely
written in C# language for Mono: the aim of the project is slightly
different than my previous attempt (Minosse, as I was saying), since
this time I'm not focusing on creating an enterprise RDBMS, but
instead an embeddable database management system based on SQL model.
DeveelDB is the result of a collaboration between me and Tobias
Downer, author of &quot;McKoi SQL Database&quot;, an ambitious and very well
written Java SQL database server: actually, at the present moment,
most of the resulting code of DeveelDB is derived by the porting of
Mckoi v1.0.3.

The result is pretty fine: the code works for 99% with very good
performances (which can be optimized by tweaking the fsync operations,
SQL parsing and some other bits of code).

You can have a look at the first released code at the project page on
Google Code: <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/deveeldb">http://code.google.com/p/deveeldb</A> .

Unfortunately, at the present moment, there's still a very small
portion of the code which doesn't work properly (and when I say
&quot;small&quot;, I mean 50 lines of code on 110k), which I identified and I'm
not able to fix.
Because of this reason I would like to invite every developer who
would be interested in the project to collaborate with me for the fix
of the latest issues on the project and the release of the version 1.0
of DeveelDB.

Cheers!
Antonello
</PRE>
