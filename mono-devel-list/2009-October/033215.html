<PRE>There has been some chatter lately about the sgen garbage collector. Does anyone know how sgen performs relative to the current libgc?

Calling 'ToString' is just a GC benchmark. Yes, the current mono GC is slower than the .NET GC in this scenario. Your other tests also do a fair bit of allocating, so it's quite possible the entire performance loss you're seeing is just from the GC kicking in. If you want to test how fast you can add elements to a Dictionary, pre-allocate all the objects first and then time just the addition.

Alan.
