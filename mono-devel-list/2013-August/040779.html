<PRE>Well that seems to have been a huge waste of time.  I built up a Fedora 18 machine, installed all of the packages necessary for building, pulled the source for mono, did a configure, make and a make install.  All went fine.

I then tried to use rpmbuild and again, I get the following error (just like I did on Ubuntu):

Error: line 51: Unknown tag: Recommends: libgdiplus0 &gt;= 2.6

At this point, should I assume that deploying Mono is best done with a tarball instead?

Subject: Re: [Mono-dev] Building a Mono RPM

So as a bit of background, this is what I&#8217;m doing.  I am building an embedded Linux platform running Wind River, which I believe is Fedora based.  The tools for building the OS came on a Ubuntu VM.  I am trying to build Mono (succeeded there), and then an installer for Mono so that I can install Mono on the embedded device.  I&#8217;ll follow that with an installer for our application.  I was told that RPM was the mechanism for installing packages on Wind River, so I went down that road.

What it sounds like you&#8217;re telling me is that for building an RPM package for Wind River, I should be using Fedora and no Ubuntu, because Ubuntu has outdated RPM infrastructure since it doesn&#8217;t use RPM for package management.

Is this all correct?

I guess I can build up a Fedora machine to do the work for the installer, it just means that now I need two dev OSes to build this target (three if you count Windows where we actually do the app development).

Is there any guide or documentation for building a Mono RPM for Fedora?

Subject: Re: [Mono-dev] Building a Mono RPM

It just sounds strange that you are trying to build an RPM package on a system based on DEB packaging, in Ubuntu it would be easier to package a .deb package to target Debian-based distros like Debian/Ubuntu/Mint/etc... or switch to Fedora as your distro for building and packaging if you are targeting the Fedora/Red Hat/Centos/etc... family of distros that use RPM files.

You can look at projects of apps that depend on Mono like MonoDevelop(<A HREF="http://monodevelop.com/">http://monodevelop.com/</A>), Banshee (<A HREF="http://banshee.fm/">http://banshee.fm/</A>), F-Spot (<A HREF="http://f-spot.org/">http://f-spot.org/</A>) are packaged for Debian/Ubuntu (not sure they are packaged for Fedora/Red Hat nowadays).

Hope it helps,

Rafael Teixeira

Let me preface this with the fact that I&#8217;m pretty new to Linux.

I have pulled the Mono source and successfully built it on 32-bit Ubuntu.  I was able to successfully take the binaries generated from a &#8220;make install&#8221; and copy them to a different Linux distribution and actually run a Mono app on that target.  That seems like the wrong way to approach it though.  I suspect I should be distributing an RPM file.

So I decided to try to build the RPM file today, and I&#8217;m having very little success.  The first issue I had was that rpmbuild would give an &#8220;Unknown command: recommends&#8221; error.  So I went into the spec fiel and commented that line out, just to see where it went from there.  Now it complains that it can&#8217;t find mono-3.3.0-tar.bz2.  I can only assume that I need to generate this file, but I&#8217;m not sure exactly how.  Is there a script that will do it, or do I just tar up the installation?

Is there any documentation on how to build an RPM starting with just a clean OS build, or at least from a system where Mono has been compiled and installed?
