<PRE>When I was contemplating making a simple UI using mono, I took a look at the
UI frameworks out there like GTK and what not. I am a die hard WPF fan.
Every single time I look at a UI framework other than WPF, I always come
back to the fact that I am taking 10 steps backwards. With that said, I was
thinking about making a small WPF like framework just to support the UI I
was making. I even took a look at how Dependency properties are implemented
under the hood on several articles online. In the end, I am never deploying
to a non windows machine, and also, I have just posted an article on
codeproject on an ongoing work about how to run the .NET framework on
windows without actually installing it. The actual redistributable I have
made is a flat 45MB. 

Another thing I don't understand and fathom is how people do not flock to
WPF. You see people sitting here trying to solve complex UI problems using a
hammer and nails, when they have a Nuke in their arsenal, which is WPF. You
can't beat WPF, I don't care what anybody says; nothing on the market comes
close. Not even QT. The layout system in WPF is just phenomenal, and the
fact that I can develop a completely custom drawn control without actually
drawing primitives and lines myself is something not to be taken lightly.
