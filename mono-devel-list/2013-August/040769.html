<PRE>Let me preface this with the fact that I&#8217;m pretty new to Linux.

I have pulled the Mono source and successfully built it on 32-bit Ubuntu.  I was able to successfully take the binaries generated from a &#8220;make install&#8221; and copy them to a different Linux distribution and actually run a Mono app on that target.  That seems like the wrong way to approach it though.  I suspect I should be distributing an RPM file.

So I decided to try to build the RPM file today, and I&#8217;m having very little success.  The first issue I had was that rpmbuild would give an &#8220;Unknown command: recommends&#8221; error.  So I went into the spec fiel and commented that line out, just to see where it went from there.  Now it complains that it can&#8217;t find mono-3.3.0-tar.bz2.  I can only assume that I need to generate this file, but I&#8217;m not sure exactly how.  Is there a script that will do it, or do I just tar up the installation?

Is there any documentation on how to build an RPM starting with just a clean OS build, or at least from a system where Mono has been compiled and installed?
