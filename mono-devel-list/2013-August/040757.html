<PRE>I followed these instructions:
<A HREF="http://shana.worldofcoding.com/en/mono_cygwin_tutorial.html#footnote1">http://shana.worldofcoding.com/en/mono_cygwin_tutorial.html#footnote1</A>
and
<A HREF="http://ivanz.com/2006/03/14/compile-mono-svn-head-on-windows/">http://ivanz.com/2006/03/14/compile-mono-svn-head-on-windows/</A>

Neither of them work.

They both assume prior knowledge of what cygwin even is.  It was all new to
me, so I've now spent 2.5 days just getting to a point of having autogen
run.  There were loads of packages missing.  One said to install gcc.  That
wasn't available - I had to google for a few hours and find I had to
install mingw-gcc and set up a link to it from gcc.  I couldn't work out
how to install gettext at all.  It wasn't listed in cygwin packages, so
I've used the --enable-nls=no.  If we don't need nls (what is nls???) then
why not make this part of the standard script?

What am I after?

A simple, pre-validated way to get to a point where I can debug the class
libraries.  The runtime prebuilt - skip the gcc step, just give me binaries.

I'm not a C++ programmer, I'm a C# programmer.  So I have nothing much to
bring to the run-time.  But I (like many other C# devs I would imagine)
will find bugs when porting my apps to Mono, and as a C# dev would be quite
happy to go and fix said bugs as I find them.  The one I've found is going
to take an hour to fix.  However If I have to spend 2 or 3 days just
getting it to compile before I can even start work, well I have paying work
to do!

The other thing I need is to know where to put unit test code.  I've found
code style guidelines, but no project structure guidelines.  When browsing
the source I couldn't find a single unit test.  I'm sure they're there
somewhere!

I love Mono.  I want to see it improve.  Doing the above (and it needs to
be someone experienced to do it) would probably add hundreds of developers
to the bugfixing crew.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can, with a fair bit of work, get the VS project files/solutions: look

</I>&gt;<i> quirks. However to my knowledge you cannot debug these through VS, unless
</I>&gt;<i> something like Mono Tools for Visual Studio is alive and maintained unknown
</I>&gt;<i> to me.
