<PRE>Hi Alex,

Thanks for the information; I sometimes need to dive into the C code to get it to compile under MSVC and your heads up is a time saver. You may want to fork+branch and do a pull request if you think these fixes are not temporary hacks.

profiler-cov is a .vcxproj file, and AFAIK not generated from makefile as the .csproj files are, as you seem to believe. This nevertheless sounds like a good idea.

I&#8217;ll work part time on the port of a large C# application to run on Mono+Linux over the coming months; while the target is Linux I think I&#8217;ll have the need to build/test on Mono+Windows too and improve the project file generation with MSVS2012. I take due note of your post

Regards,
J-M

Subject: [Mono-dev] Small issues with the Windows msvc builds, and how I got around them

Referring to commit 29c42bf0dc&#8212; just a few tips on how I got the -sgen configurations to compile in 32bit release mode with Visual Studio 2012.
&#160;
First issue&#8212;
&#160;
msvcrt apparently doesn&#8217;t implement _strtoull(). According to this Connect article[1], the functionality exists as _strtoui64().
&#160;
So, as a comment in the Connect article suggested, in eglib\src\glib.h I added this at around line 275 inside of the _MSC_VER ifdef&#8230;
&#160;
#define strtoll&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; _strtoi64
#define strtoull&#160;&#160;&#160; _strtoui64
&#160;
Second issue&#8212;
&#160;
The profiler-cov project links to mono-2.0.lib, but for the -sgen builds, it should be linking to monosgen-2.0.lib. I know the .csproj&#8217;s are generated from the makefiles so this isn&#8217;t a &#8220;real&#8221; fix, but all it took for me to get the project to build was to make the project link to the correct library.
&#160;
The x64 build fails miserably because the __asm keyword isn&#8217;t supported by Microsoft&#8217;s x64 compiler.
