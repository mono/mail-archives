</I>This is the obstacle all of us contributing to Mono encountered at some point. I think Nick and I 
came to a conclusion regarding the issue. If Nick doesn't have time to implement them, I will - but 
not right away and not now. This is an opensource project, created and developed by community - 
usually people submit patches in areas they are interested in, and that works best - as everybody 
will do their best to implement code as good as they can, because they themselves are going to use 
it and they themselves know the context in which they are using it.

&gt;<i> I would think a simple patch that avoids MissingMethodExceptions would
</I>&gt;<i> be a good thing and easy to accept.
</I>On surface, yes, in reality - no. We really try to avoid stubbed methods committed for the sake of 
having them but with no functionality. It is very likely that after comitting, the stubs will remain 
  unimplemented for unknown time, thus providing a false ilussion that Mono supports this or that 
API, which will cause (for instance) MOMA reports to show false positives etc. etc. NOT accepting 
stubs has also the effect that people (including ourselves in the team) are motivated to actually 
implement the code, IMHO.
