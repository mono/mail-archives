Correct me if I am wrong, but Ben once did a patch that used typed
allocation for all AppDomains (not only the root one).   

If I remember correctly the problem was that to avoid crashing we would
have to leak any vtables that were created on the AppDomain, as we did
not have have a way of tracking all objects that might still point to
this vtable.  

I am not sure I understand from the description above how would leaking
the vtables kill SGen.
