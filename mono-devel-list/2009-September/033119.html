Marek, if you can't do it now because you're busy with other things,
then it's easy to imagine that Nick can't do it now because he's also
busy. Also, Nick probably has less knowledge about ASP.NET internals
which raises the cost of implementation for him.

I would think a simple patch that avoids MissingMethodExceptions would
be a good thing and easy to accept.
