Take a look at HttpServerUtility.cs. It already has the 2.0 and 1.x
methods to transfer a request in place. As for the events, if you are
sure that all of them are executed in the new request, you could create
an internal method in HttpRuntime that takes the HttpWorkerRequest
object of the current request and calls 'Process (httpworkerrequest)'
and then do a Response.End ().
