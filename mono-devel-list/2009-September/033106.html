&gt;<i> Hello group,
</I>Hello,

&gt;<i> This is my first time submitting a patch.  So if anything I have done is 
</I>&gt;<i> out of the norm, please let me know so that I can correct it.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are two API's related to IIS 7.0 that were added as part of the 
</I>&gt;<i> .NET 2.0 SP2 release that I need supported for an Open Source project 
</I>&gt;<i> that I work on (<A HREF="http://urlrewriter.codeplex.com">http://urlrewriter.codeplex.com</A>). 
</I>&gt;<i>  (<A HREF="http://urlrewriter.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=7187">http://urlrewriter.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=7187</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The patch that I am submitting is for the following APIs:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     * HttpRuntime.UsingIntegratedPipeline { get; }
</I>&gt;<i>     * HttpServerUtility.TransferRequest(string,[bool],[string],[NameValueCollection])
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since both of these API's are IIS 7.0+ specific and that they require 
</I>&gt;<i> the Integrated Pipeline to function.  I have the first property 
</I>&gt;<i> UsingIntegratedPipeline always returning false, since it is currently 
</I>&gt;<i> impossible to put Mono in to the core of IIS 7.0, so Integrated Pipeline 
</I>Technically Mono has always been using what IIS 7 calls &quot;integrated pipeline&quot; - there are no plans 
to make Mono run in the IIS core, so we should try to implement whatever functionality makes sense 
in Mono context without looking whether or not it works in this or that IIS mode. I'd say 
UsingIntegratedPipeline could return 'true' without harm.

&gt;<i> can't currently be supported.  So I hoped to achieve the 2nd best option 
</I>&gt;<i> of API completeness.  The second method TransferRequest relies on the 
</I>&gt;<i> Integrated Pipeline so again it will not be supported.  So I have the 
</I>&gt;<i> method just throwing the publically available exceptions shows on MSDN. 
</I>&gt;<i>  This second method will always throw PlatformNotSupported, for API 
</I>&gt;<i> completeness with the .NET 2.0 SP2 framework.
</I>This method, as well, can be implemented to perform its function on Mono just fine. If you feel like 
giving it a try, I'd welcome a new patch which implements it. If not, I will accept the patch as it 
is now and implement the API fully at some point.

&gt;<i> Please let me know what the next steps are or if there is anything that 
</I>&gt;<i> I need to change in order to get this patch moved into production.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Nick

best regards,
