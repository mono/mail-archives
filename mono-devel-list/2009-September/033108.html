<PRE>Hi Marek,

I am a little hesitant to to implement this for Mono for the following
reasons.

*Number 1* is the description Microsoft provides for it
&quot;Gets a value that indicates whether the current application is running *in
the integrated-pipeline mode of IIS 7.0*.&quot;

*Number 2* is that the key feature of the integrated-pipeline is that
outside processes still run through the .NET framework first, such as, you
can use IHttpModules to process request/response data from for example PHP
code, I don't know enough about Mono/XPS to get something like this
working.

Many developers use the UsingIntegratedPipeline flag to indicate if they are
running in IIS 7.0 integrated mode or the older &quot;classic mode.&quot;  I really
feel that getting both the &quot;classic mode&quot; and integrated mode working under
Mono would be a huge undertaking, especially in regards to some of the built
in support for their Rewriter Module that they have added in to the .NET 2.0
SP2 framework.  Also because a number of sub-routines change in
ASP.NETdepending on this one flag.

I would like to commit the patch as is for now, to complete some of the
missing parts of the API, and I will look in to what it will take to really
get this supported in the Mono framework.

Thanks,
Nick

P.S. I know of a dozen places where having integrated mode turned on will
allow you to do things that you weren't allowed to before.  For example when
integrated mode is enabled you can directly add headers using *
HttpRequest.Headers.Add*, instead of getting an exception thrown.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HttpServerUtility.TransferRequest(string,[bool],[string],[NameValueCollection])
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Since both of these API's are IIS 7.0+ specific and that they require the

</I>&gt;<i>  can't currently be supported.  So I hoped to achieve the 2nd best option

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> second method will always throw PlatformNotSupported, for API completeness
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the .NET 2.0 SP2 framework.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This method, as well, can be implemented to perform its function on Mono
