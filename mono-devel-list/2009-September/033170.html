<PRE>It is my privilege to again apologize for the delay in the release of 2.6 preview 1.  There have been many build issues to work through.  The first preview of a new version is probably always hard like this.  I have hopes for a release today but in light of recent hurdles I have less confidence in my own hopes.


Yes, there will be a mac build in 2.6-p1

All I can tell you is that Mono 2.6 Preview 1 should be out soon, so you may
want to wait for it.
Whenever it's out, it should be available from here:

</I>&gt;<i> First off - thanks for Mono ! It is because of Mono Touch that I'm now

</I>&gt;<i> I really want to use DbMetal for generating Linq classes for my Sqlite

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So - what I would really like is if I could get a version of the current

</I>&gt;<i> Will it be there ? Or could maybe somebody tell me where to find a built
