<PRE>Hi,

  This is very tricky problem. The runtime waits for all application threads
to finish before exiting in order to have a predictable shutdown and to be
compatible with ms.net. If we didn't
wait for them, and started to free up the runtime data structures, then one
of the running threads could  access the freed data and crash/misbehave. You
might want to try to
close the file descriptor the thread is waiting on, that might break the
wait.
