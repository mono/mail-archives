<PRE>Hello group,
This is my first time submitting a patch.  So if anything I have done is out
of the norm, please let me know so that I can correct it.

There are two API's related to IIS 7.0 that were added as part of the .NET
2.0 SP2 release that I need supported for an Open Source project that I work
on (<A HREF="http://urlrewriter.codeplex.com">http://urlrewriter.codeplex.com</A>).  (
<A HREF="http://urlrewriter.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=7187">http://urlrewriter.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=7187</A>)

The patch that I am submitting is for the following APIs:

   - HttpRuntime.UsingIntegratedPipeline { get; }
   -
   HttpServerUtility.TransferRequest(string,[bool],[string],[NameValueCollection])

Since both of these API's are IIS 7.0+ specific and that they require the
Integrated Pipeline to function.  I have the first property
UsingIntegratedPipeline always returning false, since it is currently
impossible to put Mono in to the core of IIS 7.0, so Integrated Pipeline
can't currently be supported.  So I hoped to achieve the 2nd best option of
API completeness.  The second method TransferRequest relies on the
Integrated Pipeline so again it will not be supported.  So I have the method
just throwing the publically available exceptions shows on MSDN.  This
second method will always throw PlatformNotSupported, for API completeness
with the .NET 2.0 SP2 framework.

Please let me know what the next steps are or if there is anything that I
need to change in order to get this patch moved into production.

Thanks,
Nick
