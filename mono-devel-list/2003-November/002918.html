<PRE>Hi!

To get running Mono on *BSD systems we must make patches to Mono sources :(

Patches for FreeBSD are available here:
<A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/lang/mono/">http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/lang/mono/</A>

Why not merge them with Mono sources?

There will be no problem with new releases of Mono and countinous patching to get it compile.

There is statement on Mono webpage telling everybody that Mono runs on FreeBSD - it's not true! It must be patched first.

In my opinion if Mono wants to be good it must support as many platforms as possible - &quot;OUT OF BOX&quot;!

Java was marketed as &quot;portable&quot; - but unfortunately it wasn't at all!

There were no native Java JIT for BSD systems available for really long time.
Recently there is native Java port available for *BSD - but it is based on old version of Java.

Because of lack of portability(sic!) Java is dying. (my personal opinion)

I don't want to see Mono going the same way as Java went...
