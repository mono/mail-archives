glib should include iconv if your platform doesn't have it, I thought.

UTF16 is what the CLR specifies for &quot;Unicode&quot;, and as the MS runtime
always seems to use LE (whether because it's x86-platform-endian or by
choice) it makes sense to always use LE in mono.  (Page 141 of my copy
of Partition II mentions x86-endian storage for enum array elements of
fixed args that are not bool or char.  It doesn't seem to specify the
endianness of unicode chars anywhere.)

&gt;<i> Also it seems a bit odd to have both ICU (which I do have at present) and

</I>
I could have used ICU, but that would have made it a strict dependency
not an optional one.  As glib is already a strict dependency I chose to
use that one.  I suppose strenc.c could check for ICU and use that if
possible.
