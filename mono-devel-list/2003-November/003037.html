<PRE>Hi all, 

to clear this up for myself (not being a c-programmer shared libs
are/were foreign to me) I wrote a little sample based on Daniel's work
creating a shared library, then using it in a c program and finally
DLLImporting it into a csharp program as well. I needed much more time
getting it to work in c than csharp but that is likely due to the fact
that the last time I delved into the subject was in CS141 back in
1996...

;-)

What I found out:

&gt;<i> I think the problem in this case is that the runtime doesn't have a
</I>&gt;<i> mapping set up to find the library; you're going to need to edit
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/mono/config and add a &lt;dllmap&gt; entry. (As far as I know, there's no
</I>&gt;<i> way to extend this scheme, which seems like it could be a big problem
</I>&gt;<i> for third-party apps to me).
</I>
This doesn't seem to be true. I simply set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include
the lib dir in question and things worked. I think I needed to do this
to compile/run the c-program as well...

I also ran into the &quot;mono wants to append 'lib' to the to-be-imported
library name problem&quot;. To solve it, I just renamed the lib (libtest.so)
and then did [DllImport(&quot;test&quot;)] instead.

It works now for me in my simple c and csharp app. Maybe this
mini-tutorial can help someone else out there to understand it too. 

Regards,
--chris

ps: yes, i know the c-code and the makefile probably are horrid, but it
works for me :-P

pps:btw, if its relevant: I am testing this on a Mandrake 9.1 system
with gcc 3.2.2 and 0.28 mono from redcarpet.
