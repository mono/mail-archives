Well, it is good to know that I'm not alone.

My working hypothesis was that the problem is due to there being
several different boxes that answer to the name anoncvs.go-mono.com.
However, there is only IP address:

<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">gs234 at belldandy</A>:~$ host anoncvs.go-mono.com
anoncvs.go-mono.com is an alias for cvs.hispalinux.es.
cvs.hispalinux.es is an alias for reypastor.hispalinux.es.
reypastor.hispalinux.es has address 213.229.161.44
<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">gs234 at belldandy</A>:~$ 

However, there might be several different machines lurking behind that
IP address.  I loaded up cvs.hispalinux.es in my browser in order to
find out who I should talk to about this; but the resulting page is
entirely in Spanish, a language that I do not know.  Can someone who
does know Spanish tell me who I should email?

PS &lt;<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/anoncvs.html">http://www.go-mono.com/anoncvs.html</A>&gt; says that one can also use
anoncvs-spain-1.go-mono.com, anoncvs-spain-2.go-mono.com or
anoncvs-us-1.go-mono.com, but none of those hostnames seem to exist.
I wanted to file a bugzilla bug about this, but no category on
bugzilla.ximian.com seemed appropriate.
