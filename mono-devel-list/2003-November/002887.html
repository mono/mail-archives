<PRE>I'd be more than willing to take a section of the code and writeup
skeleton's for them.  Suggestions where to start (what are you doing
first?)?  

We really need a complete list of what ObjectSpaces provides, a check
list of sorts.  It would need to be pretty detailed (lots of layers). 
And from that we can easily pick implementation paths.  Just like with
Mono, not everything is there yet, but almost every feature that is
relied on is.  In my mind that would help make ObjectSpaces seem
smaller, thus easier to manage.  

I completely agree with your point the ProviderBase classes.  The point
is to get something running, and we can then continue to fix up all the
sections as they become apparent.
