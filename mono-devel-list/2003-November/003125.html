<PRE>I have a few questions about how code that uses the Boehm GC interacts
with libraries that were not compiled against the Boehm GC
library/headers.

I am seeing some odd behaviour when using Platform Invoke (P/Invoke) in
Mono to invoke native libraries from Mono. From what I can see, it seems
like there is some sort of memory corruption going on.

The native library makes use of:
 - malloc(), free()
 - pthread_create()
 - pthread_cond_init(), pthread_cond_signal(), pthread_cond_wait()
 - sem_init(), sem_wait(), sem_post()
 - msgsnd(), msgrcv()

The questions I have are:

1. Is memory that I allocate with malloc() in libraries that were not
compiled against boehm seen by the garbage collector? (will it ever be
collected out from under me?)

2. Will boehm just &quot;ignore&quot; any threads that were created by
a version of pthread_create() that was not wrapped by boehm?

3. Will anything bad happen if the libraries that I invoke use
pthread_cond_wait()?

thanks.
