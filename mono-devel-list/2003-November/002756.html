<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Don't get me wrong Miguel, 
</I>&gt;<i> I wasn't judging IBM, I was just wondering the implications, if it's just
</I>&gt;<i> for their DB2 customers, then that's that. However, if the reason was the
</I>&gt;<i> second, this would imply (among others) that we can expect more .NET support
</I>&gt;<i> / products from IBM(apart from Rational), which would be great.
</I>&gt;<i> .NET is a great world, but so far, Microsoft hasn't had that much
</I>&gt;<i> competition. Having more big companies in the world would increase
</I>&gt;<i> competition, increase adoption, increase Mono usage by those companies(e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> IBM is heavily promoting linux, so Mono would be an obvious choice), and
</I>&gt;<i> increase innovation. 
</I>
Yup, understood.  I just wanted to avoid going down the path of
speculation :-)

The CLR is now the Microsoft platform.   The path on which they will
build their future.  Any vendor that wants to sell products or services
on Windows will have to interop with .NET in one way or another.

The new launch of Longhorn has just stressed this: it is all being done
in managed code.

Miguel
