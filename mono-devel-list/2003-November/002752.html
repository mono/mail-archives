<PRE>I'm wondering what IBM's reason is to support .NET... in any case, by
providing .NET support IBM confirms .NET's increasing market adoptance...
but I only can see I few reasons:

- Keep their DB2 customers who are switching to .NET
- Beginning to cover their ass as they are completely Java focused...

I began to think about the last option when I was reading today's issue of
SDTimes, on p.35 - p.36, which discuss Java's ongoing troubles...
IBM's competition would sure be great in the .NET world...

Anyone any opinions on this subject? Is IBM providing support for its
customers or for themselves?

Greetz,

</I>&gt;<i> Hello!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Very interesting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;- Take advantage of DB2's native stored procedure capability by
</I>&gt;<i> developing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;on the Windows
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;platform and deploying across all supported DB2 platforms
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How could they do that without a CLR for every DB2 platform ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Unless there are small print characters at the end of document ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Funny.  I asked this exact same question at the `Embedding the CLR'
</I>&gt;<i> panel during the PDC to the IBM guy (he was an invited expert in the
</I>&gt;<i> panel).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> They said that they had no plans at this point of supporting Mono on
</I>&gt;<i> other platforms and mostly focused on getting the reliability on
</I>&gt;<i> Windows for now, but that the option was not closed.  Something along
</I>&gt;<i> those lines.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The IBM DB2 developer explained that DB2 does not host the CLR directly
</I>&gt;<i> on the same process as the database.   It hosts it on a separate
</I>&gt;<i> process, and they have some IPC mechanism to talk to it.  That allows
</I>&gt;<i> them to host three scripting languages: Java, the CLR and their own,
</I>&gt;<i> without having each one fighting for more control than they can provide.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I obviously would love to see IBM embed Mono as their offering on Unix,
</I>&gt;<i> but it is early to tell.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Miguel.
