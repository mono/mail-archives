<PRE>Well, you've got a point, without a doubt.
But Miguel also has a point in that Mono should be releasing a stable
release very soon now... I believe Mono has a lot of momentum right now, by
waiting too long, that momentum could decrease, having the same result by
losing a large user base...

As we cannot have both ( complete .NET 1.0 support and a release very soon )
we must find an optimal solution...

Greetz,

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [Mono-devel-list] Version moniker for Mono Release
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've been thinking a bit about the moniker of &quot;Mono 1.0&quot; that is currently
</I>&gt;<i> being used to describe the planned first stable/public/non-development
</I>&gt;<i> release of Mono.  I suggest we take some time to think about that before
</I>&gt;<i> using it willy-nilly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe from a marketing point of view this might have some problems.
</I>&gt;<i> We
</I>&gt;<i> are implying, regardless of how much we qualify ourselves in ReadMe's,
</I>&gt;<i> descriptions of contents and caveats, that Mono 1.0 is the same as .NET
</I>&gt;<i> 1.0.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe a large number of people who are exposed to Mono first as a 1.0
</I>&gt;<i> product will have a negative impression. I think there will be many
</I>&gt;<i> Windows
</I>&gt;<i> developers (including ISV's) that will see &quot;Mono 1.0 Released!&quot; and think,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Hey, I'd love to run my app on Linux if I could.&quot; They will install it,
</I>&gt;<i> try
</I>&gt;<i> to run their .NET app they've already built on it, and *most likely* find
</I>&gt;<i> out it doesn't work for them.  They will then come away with a negative
</I>&gt;<i> impression that &quot;mono doesn't work.&quot; Initial impressions are hard to
</I>&gt;<i> change.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, some will file bugzilla reports and some will even become significant
</I>&gt;<i> contributors.  However, those will be a *very* small percentage. It seems
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> me a significant risk to possibly alienate such a large user base. We need
</I>&gt;<i> to be aware that we are not only targeting developers who are building
</I>&gt;<i> apps
</I>&gt;<i> geared for Mono, but there is a significant number of people with apps
</I>&gt;<i> already built, in progress, or whatever that are waiting to run them on
</I>&gt;<i> Linux.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The suggestion of calling it &quot;Mono Core 1.0&quot; is on the right track, I
</I>&gt;<i> think.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I think the name needs to more strongly reflect the reality that
</I>&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;<i> will contain a subset of whatever an equivalent version of .NET has.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In addition, consider the situation 5 or so years from now when we have
</I>&gt;<i> say,
</I>&gt;<i> Mono 1.8 and .NET 2.3.  What is anyone new to .NET/Mono supposed to make
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> that?  Even the core hackers will be hard pressed to remember what's in
</I>&gt;<i> what.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I think we should discuss it and carefully consider it.  Names do
</I>&gt;<i> have a significant impact.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Comments?
</I>&gt;<i>
