<PRE>Matthew,

Having woken up with a bit of a gnarly hangover this morning, I actually
decided I should put my fingers to my keyboard and started tapping out
some files for ObjectSpaces.

It looks to me that there's a damned lot that needs doing, but I've set
myself a personal goal of trying to generate a complete set of files
with the correct method signatures by the end of November.  I reckon
generating a complete set of signatured files is an excellent way to
understand how the various bits fit together, and if you want to take on
some of the files, great, otherwise I'll keep on tapping and you can use
your energy on more interesting bits of ObjectSpace.

The noisiest issues circulating in my mind are whether the
implementation can rely on other ADO.NET 2.0 features (particularly the
ProviderBase stuff and generics), although I don't see any reason why it
shouldn't use Mono's provider factory in the first instance and then
sway to the providerbase when and as it's implemented in Mono.

Ps I've drawn a UML Visio diagram to try and grapple with my
understanding of ObjectSpaces which you can take a peek at
<A HREF="http://www.tebiki.co.uk/downloads/ObjectSpaces_Design.vsd">http://www.tebiki.co.uk/downloads/ObjectSpaces_Design.vsd</A> or
<A HREF="http://www.tebiki.co.uk/downloads/ObjectSpaces_Design.jpg.">http://www.tebiki.co.uk/downloads/ObjectSpaces_Design.jpg.</A> I'll try to
update it as my understanding evolves, but the MS documentation is so
pants its difficult to tell which is ObjectSpace's arse and which bits
are its elbows at the moment.

It sounds like you've got everything.

For now I'm just going to spend some time looking through their 
documentation which can be found by going to Longhorn's SDK 
(<A HREF="http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com">http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com</A>) and searching for ObjectSpaces.  
A LOT of stuff will come up.  Perhaps then I'll have a better idea of
how to _really_ get started.  

Keep in touch.

~ Matthew
