<PRE>I've been playing around with mono for some time, and I've managed to
get it installed and partially running under Mac OS 10.3.  Has anyone
figured out the cause or probably cause of the Bus Errors that seem to
plague Mono when running on the Mac?

 

What I'm really trying for is to get xsp running so I can start doing
some asp.net development for a Mac system.  However, running XSP under
mint or mono gives me the less than helpful Bus Error.  I've seen the
same error running anything through the JIT engine, and also when trying
to run even a simple VB program.  I hope to this weekend start looking
at what could be the cause, but I thought I'd ask on the list if anyone
else had looked into this problem already, and could give me more
information.

 

Thanks.

 

Ryan Gregg
