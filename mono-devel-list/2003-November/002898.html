<PRE>I would be willing to help out, given that we can get enough information
out of MS on it.  I haven't looked at the docs myself, but I'll do that
tonight.

</I>&gt;<i> I completely agree with your point the ProviderBase classes.  The point

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Having woken up with a bit of a gnarly hangover this morning, I actually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decided I should put my fingers to my keyboard and started tapping out
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some files for ObjectSpaces.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It looks to me that there's a damned lot that needs doing, but I've set
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; myself a personal goal of trying to generate a complete set of files
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with the correct method signatures by the end of November.  I reckon
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; generating a complete set of signatured files is an excellent way to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; understand how the various bits fit together, and if you want to take on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some of the files, great, otherwise I'll keep on tapping and you can use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; your energy on more interesting bits of ObjectSpace.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The noisiest issues circulating in my mind are whether the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implementation can rely on other ADO.NET 2.0 features (particularly the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ProviderBase stuff and generics), although I don't see any reason why it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; shouldn't use Mono's provider factory in the first instance and then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sway to the providerbase when and as it's implemented in Mono.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mark 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ps I've drawn a UML Visio diagram to try and grapple with my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; understanding of ObjectSpaces which you can take a peek at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.tebiki.co.uk/downloads/ObjectSpaces_Design.vsd">http://www.tebiki.co.uk/downloads/ObjectSpaces_Design.vsd</A> or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.tebiki.co.uk/downloads/ObjectSpaces_Design.jpg.">http://www.tebiki.co.uk/downloads/ObjectSpaces_Design.jpg.</A> I'll try to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; update it as my understanding evolves, but the MS documentation is so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pants its difficult to tell which is ObjectSpace's arse and which bits
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are its elbows at the moment.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Considering I haven't taken an active part in Mono yet, is there any

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For now I'm just going to spend some time looking through their

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (<A HREF="http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com">http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com</A>) and searching for ObjectSpaces.  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A LOT of stuff will come up.  Perhaps then I'll have a better idea of

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Keep in touch.
