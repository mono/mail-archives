<PRE>Hi,
   Me and one of my friends are student of the Universiy Laval (in 
Quebec, Canada) in computer science.  In winter we will finish our studies.
In our program, there is a course named ( traducted! ) &quot;Initiative 
personal works&quot;.

Both of us had experience with .NET and Linux. Therefore, we wants to 
take Mono as a subject for this course but we need a detailed project to 
work on. Do you have any suggestion ?
We need to concentrate our work on a task wich could be &quot;finished&quot; in 
approximately 3 months.

Another &quot;problem&quot;  is that we have to be evaluated. The usual projects 
for this cours needs to be sponsored by enterprises. At the end, they 
must &#233;valuate the work done.  So, we need to get a score for this project.

In the even that we work in a project like Mono,  how our work could be 
evaluated?
