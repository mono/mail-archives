To follow up on the message I just posted...

I've stubbed all of System.Data.Mapping.  I spent a few hours today
laying out diagrams for the Namespace (good old pen and paper), and it
makes perfect sense.  Every class has direct relation to the 3 required
files to make ObjectSpaces work (Map.xml, OSD.xml, RSD.xml).  I know I'm
jumping a bit a head of myself not really knowing my Thanksgiving plans
too much, but I'm going to try and have a mass majority of it up and
running by the end of next week.  It shouldn't actually be too hard, its
mostly populating classes from Xml data, and tossing them into
collections.  Then ObjectSpaces gets access to everything through
MappingSchema.

So yeah....I've run out of things to say.  Let me know how all of this
sounds and where you're at (and everyone else from the ObjectSpace
collective).  I believe you and Mark are working on the same areas?  Has
anyone claimed the other namespaces
System.Data.ObjectSpaces.Query/Schema or
System.Data.Mapping.RelationalSchema?
