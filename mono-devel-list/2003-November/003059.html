<PRE>The bus errors are caused by the GC.  It seems to be broken on OS X and 
from what I read here before and around the net, on all BSDs.  It does 
work, however, if you choose not to use a GC.  Unfortunately, this 
means mono will never release memory until it is terminated.

Also, the JIT is incomplete.  You must use the interpreter at this 
point on OSX.  There has been some recent work done on the PPC JIT, but 
I don't know its status beyond that it doesn't work yet. :)
