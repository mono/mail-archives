<PRE>So there isn't anything in the calls I listed that would strike you as
possibly leading to memory leaks/corruption?

Are there any defines I can use to help track down where the corruption is
coming from?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have a few questions about how code that uses the Boehm GC interacts
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with libraries that were not compiled against the Boehm GC
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; library/headers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am seeing some odd behaviour when using Platform Invoke 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (P/Invoke) in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mono to invoke native libraries from Mono. From what I can 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; see, it seems
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like there is some sort of memory corruption going on.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The native library makes use of:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - malloc(), free()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - pthread_create()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - pthread_cond_init(), pthread_cond_signal(), pthread_cond_wait()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - sem_init(), sem_wait(), sem_post()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - msgsnd(), msgrcv()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The questions I have are:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Is memory that I allocate with malloc() in libraries that were not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compiled against boehm seen by the garbage collector? (will it ever be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; collected out from under me?)
</I>&gt;<i> Assuming the GC library was not compiled with -DREDIRECT_MALLOC,
</I>&gt;<i> memory allocated with malloc is neither collected nor traced.  The
</I>&gt;<i> malloced objects should not disappear out from under you.  The collectable
</I>&gt;<i> objects they refer to may.  (The collector tries not to trace malloced
</I>&gt;<i> memory.  Under win32, it sometimes ends up tracing it anyway, which is
</I>&gt;<i> benign for correctness, but not performance.  It can
</I>&gt;<i> never collect memory allocated through the system malloc.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. Will boehm just &quot;ignore&quot; any threads that were created by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a version of pthread_create() that was not wrapped by boehm?
</I>&gt;<i> I believe that's correct (for the collector, not me personally :-) ),
</I>&gt;<i> provided the collector is initialized from the main thread,
</I>&gt;<i> and you are not on a platform on which the collector can enuumerate
</I>&gt;<i> all threads.  (Currently that happens for win32 with the collector
</I>&gt;<i> in its own dll.)  The collector currently needs to know about the
</I>&gt;<i> main thread.  (It currently has no way to find the stack base of
</I>&gt;<i> an arbitrary thread, and hence &quot;knows&quot; that it is initialized from the
</I>&gt;<i> main thread, so that it can register the initializing thread.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note that if the ignored threads change pointers in/to the garbage-collected
</I>&gt;<i> heap, all bets are off.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. Will anything bad happen if the libraries that I invoke use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pthread_cond_wait()?
</I>&gt;<i> If the collector knows about it, I suspect that the pthread_cond_wait() call may
</I>&gt;<i> terminate after the collector stops and restarts the thread.  But that's OK, since
</I>&gt;<i> the pthread spec allows that behavior anyway.
