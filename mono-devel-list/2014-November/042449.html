<PRE>I am glad to see others trying to build a Mono for Windows Installer.&#160; 

Removing un-needed static libraries could make the installer much smaller.&#160; Unless, you are doing embedded. Well, if you are doing embedded, you are most likely building mono yourself anyways.&#160;&#160; Mono's static library is huge.&#160;&#160;&#160; Usually on Windows, these static libraries would have a .lib extension, but since these libraries were originally built using gcc, they probably have a .a or .dll.a extension.&#160; If you include glib/gtk 2.0, there are static libraries there we do not need for gtk+ libraries.&#160;&#160; However, keep those static libraries which can help re-building mono from git.

We could also save space in the installer if we only include the latest 4.5 profile.&#160; Another words, remove 2.0, 3.5, and 4.0..
Just my 2 cents.

 &#160;
 Jo Shields is currently working on revamping the Windows Installer in his repo: <A HREF="https://github.com/directhex/newbuilder">https://github.com/directhex/newbuilder</A>
 I contributed the WiX setup files for creating an MSI installer. Jo sent me this link for a preview build (the usual caveats apply): <A HREF="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz6-k9ELOQf3YTE1RHV3Y0dNaFU/view">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz6-k9ELOQf3YTE1RHV3Y0dNaFU/view</A>
  
 
 That sounds great. Maybe I will try to bolt that onto the Appveyor script then. I'd love for the CI builds to just result in an MSI anybody can grab and use easily.
 
 
 &#160;
 Btw. while developing the WiX setup&#160;I used the binaries from your AppVeyor build, it all worked fine :)
  
 
 Really good to hear that thanks Alex :) 
 
 
 &#160;
 Can you maybe also make changes to <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/docs/compiling-mono/windows/&#160;(just">http://www.mono-project.com/docs/compiling-mono/windows/&#160;(just</A> click the &quot;edit page on github&quot; link), so it reflects what is necessary right now to build Mono on Windows? I think that page is pretty outdated right now.
  
 
 
 Yes it's definitely on my TODO list. I was hoping to grab the content of my CodeProject article and massage it into that page. Things have just been so hectic here I haven't had the chance yet :)


 
 Cheers,
 
 Alex
