<PRE>Hello Mono team,

As you know, Microsoft .NET 4.0 cannot marshal generic delegates. This is a
problem because .NET 4 is the last version of .NET that works on Windows XP
which is still widely used (please, I don't want to argue about this - it's
a fact). On the other hand, I remember having seen many years ago at these
very lists that Mono had been actually able to do it before .NET 4.0 was
released. I've also read that it was subsequently artificially disabled in
order to maintain compatibility with .NET.

So, given the above, my question is: now that .NET has been open-sourced, do
you think you'd be able to convince Microsoft to accept a contribution from
you about that piece so that they can release it in a .NET 4.0 update?
