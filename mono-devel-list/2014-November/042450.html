IN THEORY, the current state of things is:

Check out newbuilder.git

Run ./mono-MDK-windows

This will download Mono from git, a compiled Mono MDK (used as the
&quot;source&quot; for a lot of the non-runtime components), and GTK# for Windows
(ditto). I didn't feel like learning how to build GTK# and F# and
IronPython and Boo and IronRuby on Windows.

However, this will likely break because I make assumptions relating to
the upcoming 3.12 release (my target right now), and master differs in
important ways (i.e. the 4.5-only thing). It also assumes VS2013 is
installed, doesn't massage the Cygwin environment the way the Appveyor
config does, needs an older Mono (for bootstrapping) in $PATH, and so on.

Step 1 is getting it good enough to do everything right in my Windows
VM. Then I can subtree it into the regular github/mono/release.git repo,
and people are encouraged to send pull requests to fix
not-running-on-Jo's-laptop assumptions. FWIW the existing Windows build
system in github.com/mono/release.git/windows-installer/ has a LOT of
running-on-a-former-employee's-desktop assumptions, so at least things
aren't moving backwards per se.

The current status with a primed 3.12 build (`defs/mono download
mono-3.12.0-branch` and `defs/managed-components download
<A HREF="http://path-to-3.12-MDK`">http://path-to-3.12-MDK`</A> where I don't think those MDK builds are public
right now) *should* be fully functional. I did a lot of work on
Thursday/Friday to integrate all the junk we ship with Mac (Boo, IPy,
IR, F#) but haven't tested all those changes as I ran out of time.
Monday is testing/fixing, and posting a &quot;this should work, honest&quot;
preview rather than a &quot;this might partially work&quot; preview.
