<PRE>Here's the diff between my trimmed version and the original: <A HREF="http://www.mergely.com/9E70e5Ls/">http://www.mergely.com/9E70e5Ls/</A>
 
Hmm, I actually think that most of the removed methods don't matter (as they aren't called anyway). I just wanted to make the file only contain the code that is necessary.
The only &quot;real&quot; changes I had to make where accesses to internal fields in NumberFormatInfo, I just replaced them with accesses to the public properties that read them.
Maybe it makes more sense to correct those accesses directly in the referencesource, so we can reference it from there?
As a general guidance, when should we copy something to the Mono tree vs. editing referencesource? And if we copy, should we keep unneeded methods or remove them?

Hey Alex,
In general, the approach works.
I am curious as to what is that you had to remove, and why.   Can you describe the needed changes?   (I saw the diff, but it is hard to tell what happened with it).
I thought that Numerics was pretty much standalone.

Hey, I've been trying to port System.Numerics (BigInteger, Complex classes) from referencesource to see and feel what the process looks like.
It mostly went fine, but there was one file (number.cs) I couldn't reference directly from the submodule and had to copy to the assembly folder in the Mono tree.
 
I had to remove a bunch of code from that file to trim it down to only what is needed for System.Numerics to compile (all the tests pass now as well).
Question: is this a valid approach or is there something better? Note that ifdefing the file wasn't feasible as it originally sits inside corlib and has many other unrelated methods in it.
 
Here's the commit with the WIP: <A HREF="https://github.com/akoeplinger/mono/commit/d7c461155a975a35f76b79ebcc3fe33407bd5dce">https://github.com/akoeplinger/mono/commit/d7c461155a975a35f76b79ebcc3fe33407bd5dce</A>
