<PRE>I beg to differ :)
 
The same argument could be made the other way round: if someone only watches GitHub and not the mailing-list, they also miss out.
I filter the notifications from GitHub exactly the same way as I do the mails on this list (and the threading option in mail clients really helps here), so for me it doesn't make a difference.
 
Anyway, sorry for sidetracking this thread, I can deal with whatever works best for the Mono team.
We should take a fresh look at the PRs anyway as soon as the MS referencesource integration is done.

Hey Alex,
I covered this on this mailing list a few weeks ago.
Discussing in a pull request is a terrible idea, as it keeps the discussion away from the various people that might need to weigh on a particular topic.   The discussion often involves the person submitting, and a couple of curious people, but it does not reach all the stake holders.   It requires constant monitoring and constant care.  And if someone does not have the time to go and click through every discussion on pull request for every project that matters, decisions happen in what amounts to closed doors.
Sure, it is open.   Just like having a discussion in a caffe is, and making decisions without other stake holders.
So while initially I was lukewarm at the idea of discussing things on pull request, now I think it is actively damaging to open source projects.

Tip: you can &quot;unwatch&quot; the repo on GitHub, then you only get notifications for threads you participated in.

I'm a bit torn about mandating that every PR discussion needs to happen on this mailing list, mainly because I really like GitHub's UI and being able to track back the PR discussion from the commit.
 
... and I really don't feel comfortable with mailman sending me my plaintext password in 2014.

Hello,
I think we need to have a deeper discussion on the PR1297.
I do not think that we should have these discussions on the pull requests, this is a great example of another pull request discussion that just got lost.   GitHub is very spammy with notifications, so I personally just filter that out (and so do many other people).
Pull requests should be discussed in this mailing list.

It'd be great to get PR1297 and PR1319 sorted in time for 3.12, plus a

bunch of recent Windows/MSVC commits so I can work towards a stable

3.12 Windows installer:
