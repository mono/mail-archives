<PRE>Well the issue with the NuGet-based BCL libraries like System.Console is that the actual implementation still depends on Windows internals, e.g. a very quick peak with a decompiler on the new System.Console NuGet library reveals dozens of DllImport(&quot;api-ms-win-core-file-l1-1-0.dll&quot;) and corresponding P/Invokes. I can't see how that would work on other platforms.
 
The things they're testing with Mono is akin to their support for the &quot;full&quot; Desktop .NET framework, which is a different story than CoreCLR.

As I follow the github discussions in some of the asp.net vnext subprojects, I see them testing on Mono (in MacOS X) as part of the development process, but yet some things are lagging a bit... :)

So, after thinking about this further.  The question I have is not really about CoreCLR.
What I want to know is, the libraries that Microsoft are making available via their nuget (myget at the moment), are these going to be tested again .net, mono and CoreCLR? I.e will the libraries be cross platform?
Thanks

Martin



I just asked about CoreCLR on Linux during today's ASP.NET vNext community standup and the answer was:
&quot;CoreCLR runs on Windows. On Linux you use Mono.&quot; (<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oafQVI4Lx4#t=706">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oafQVI4Lx4#t=706</A>)
 
That should clarify it pretty much :)

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note: the following is based on discussions with David Fowler (one of the MS devs) et.al. in JabbR and other places. I'm not part of MS/vNext team or Xamarin, so I may be totally wrong :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;CoreCLR is intended to be Windows-only too from what I've heard, as it doesn't make much sense for Mono (you can already do side-by-side deployment of Mono).&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Where have you seen this, do you have a link you can send? This is a major missing piece of the puzzle for me. I've been hoping that with vNext, applications would be truely cross platform, but it seems we are still very much reliant on Mono's class implementations.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've read an article[1] that says the CoreCLR (&quot;Cloud Optimized&quot;) is to be &quot;Cross Platform&quot;. If that is the case, and there are no plans to make a linux compatible version and just use mono, they could easily say the same about the .NET 4.5 class libraries as they are available in mono.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You should keep in mind that CoreCLR is just that - another runtime implementation (they based this off of the old Silverlight runtime which was side-by-side deployable). What they now put on top is the class libraries distributed via NuGet, resulting in this self-contained experience. As I said, it's just one of the options alongside .NET CLR and Mono CLR, like this picture from your article shows: <A HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-filesystemfile.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-84-75-metablogapi/7356.image_5F00_70B63F1D.png">http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-filesystemfile.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-84-75-metablogapi/7356.image_5F00_70B63F1D.png</A> (the article never says the CoreCLR is cross-platform, just the vNext application itself)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So either, when Microsoft refer to &quot;Cross platform&quot;, they are only referring to applications that rely on no class libraries and only corlib (is that a thing can an application be purely reliant on no class libraries?). Alternatively, they are relying on Mono to create a CoreCLR (I wouldn't be surprised if they've ask for Xamarin's help in doing that).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The end result should be that you can run your app on .NET, CoreCLR and Mono and the app doesn't care. The problem with the web frameworks like MVC etc. up until now was that they were tightly coupled to System.Web, which is not open-source and very difficult to reimplement in Mono (and to be honest likely also lagged behind because Xamarin's focus is on mobile). The new vNext stacks don't rely on System.Web anymore and just use the basic class libraries that are well implemented on Mono too (like corlib, System.Net etc. as they're important to Xamarin). It should be a much much better experience given that Microsoft actively tests the vNext stack on Mono. Now if **your** application code relies on something that isn't implemented on Mono then that's a problem, sure.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am aware that you can side-by-side in mono, however, I thought that one of the other big benefits of vNext was the reduction in footprint, specifically around the memory footprint per request. So you can opt-in/out of specific features.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe they'll make this whole CoreCLR/small-footprint - experience available on other OSs as well, but from what I've heard this is targeted at Windows for now.
