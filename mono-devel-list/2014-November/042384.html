<PRE>Hi All,

I'm planning on taking on the porting of part of System.Web, so I thought I
would make people aware so that we're not all working on the same thing.

My process is to start with importing HttpApplication in it's entirety,
then pull in the surrounding classes so it compiles.  I can then start
running some tests to see how close we are.  Until the fork is in, I've
copied them into my local instance, and changing them there, so the sooner
we get the fork setup the better.

So far, I've noted that there are a few things that this work will be
dependent on.

First, we need to the fork and sub-module up and running for the reference
source, so I can doing pull requests on there.

Second, come up with a way to exclude code without deleting it (I'm
assuming we won't to go down the #ifdef route rather than simply removing
the code from the fork).  I'm thinking there's probably something we can
use already, so just need to know what that is.  (something like #if !MONO
??)

Third, Miguel had an idea of how to do the String resources so we don't
need to refactor large amounts of the referencesource.  The script needs
work, and is probably a job in it's own right.

Finally, as I won't be replacing every file, some will just have large
amounts of additions/fixes, it's probably worth getting the legacy #ifdef's
before I send a pull.

I have around a week to get this done, if I don't manage to get it
completed, I will be able to do some work, just not full-time.  I will
however make my fork available for people to continue it.

Please let me know your thoughts, and if you think there may be a better
way to do this.
