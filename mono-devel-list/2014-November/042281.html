<PRE>Hi All,

I thought I'd break this into a separate review as there as has been some
questions raised on it's validity.

After reviewing, since we're implementing the change that forces the use of
Request.InputStream over the GetBuffer* methods, the only people who will
hit the MissingMethodException as those no following the correct
convention.  Therefore we can hold of on putting this in until all the
other methods are there.

Therefore I'm going to close this PR for now.  If anyone has any other
opinions, please let me know.  Also, if you want to implement them, feel
free.

What I realised when trying to implement these is that the
BufferlessInputStream needs to store things, or we need to get a second
type BufferedInputStream.  On top of this, I'm not sure of all the places
where all the exceptions need to be raised etc.  Finally, I'm not sure how
to test this inside a unit test, so it seems like something that would be
an &quot;implement and hope&quot; type PR.

As it's not required for MVC, I'm pushing this down my list for now.

Thanks,
Martin
