<PRE>Yeah, I think having something in-box with Mono just for convenience makes less sense these days given that we have NuGet.
I'd actually advocate removing everything from the Mono distribution that does not also ship with the .NET BCL (except maybe things like Mono.Simd which requires specific runtime features).
The world is moving towards a more modular approach and (just like .NET Core) we should leverage NuGet where we can.

I agree with removing Npgsql from Mono.  Or either convince someone to commit the latest version of Npgsql to mono.  It would have to build with mono's build system though.  Francisco?
 
The main reason it was included in mono was so you could have an out-of-the-box experience with mono connecting to Postgres.

The latest XamarinStudio/MonoDevelop MVC template installs it from NuGet, so I think it should be fine to remove. It might not work perfectly until the System.Web from referencesource is integrated, but the same applies to the existing (outdated) copy we ship currently. This is something I've been working on.  MVC 5.2.2 (the one available on NuGet) just doesn't work at the moment due to this pull <A HREF="https://github.com/mono/mono/pull/1349">https://github.com/mono/mono/pull/1349</A> being required (and I haven't had chance to fix the things that Miguel wanted).In addition, the old notes on getting MVC 3 working on mono, said to remove the MS supplied versions of the dlls IIRC, so these would stop working on upgrade (and replacing with the nuget ones for MVC3 probably won't work).
