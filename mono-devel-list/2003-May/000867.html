<PRE>How can the corlib and runtime be out of sync after one build?  It's
possible because of a &quot;deficiency&quot; within mono.  A deficiency I'd like
to correct, and would welcome suggestions for fixes (hey lupus!).

Mono attempts to bind methods &quot;early.&quot;  Put another way, if we have the
following two methods declared:

	[MethodImpl (MethodImplOptions.InternalCall)]
	private static extern void NeverCalled ();

	[DllImport (&quot;does-not-exist.dll&quot;)]
	private static extern void AlsoNeverCalled ();

Mono will issue a &quot;corlib out of sync&quot; warning for NeverCalled() and an
equivalent &quot;can't find library does-not-exist.dll&quot; warning for
AlsoNeverCalled().  Even though these functions aren't used (just
present in the IL), mono generates a warning.

.NET, on the other hand, permits both of these to be defined and never
issues a warning for either one.

What I would prefer to see is that the warnings are only issued IF THE
METHOD IS ACTUALLY INVOKED.

Implementing this is what I could use some suggestions for.

How's this apply to you?  You built a new corlib.  MCS, merely seeing
the *declarations* for the InternalCall (NeverCalled()), will issue a
&quot;corlib out of sync&quot; warning.  In this case, it's completely groundless,
and can be ignored.

This also applies to apps that have their own internal calls (XSP, IIRC)
and apps which DllImport Win32 DLLs but have a runtime check so they
don't invoke Win32 functions inappropriately.  Both of these
circumstances generate useless warnings.

In general, you can ignore the &quot;corlib out of sync&quot; warnings when you're
*building* corlib (or anything else that may declare InternalCalls). 
It's only when you're running the application *using* the InternalCalls
that the warning actually needs to be headed.

So, you're seeing normal behavior.  Install your new corlib, make &amp;
install the runtime, and all *should* be well.  (If it isn't well,
recompile corlib under the new runtime, which should remove the
warnings.)

Thanks,
 - Jon
