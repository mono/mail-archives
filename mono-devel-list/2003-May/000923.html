<PRE>Nick,

Honestly, I have _no clue_ how to get this done in NAnt (Miguel, I
explained this more in the email from last night).

I think Miguel will agree that two build systems are harder to maintain
than one. I have suggested (again, privately) that we rely on the
makefile system on Windows.

I actually have no problem using NAnt, as long as we just dump the
makefile system. If you can figure out a simple way to do it on NAnt, it
would get my vote, however I don't think I have time right now to
dedicate to that. (Tag! You're it!)

Miguel should be taking care of the makefiles soon, it turns out that
the task was very simple, and so he will just do it rather than spending
time reviewing/correcting my changes.

Nick: can you isolate the problem that is causing compatibility issues,
and post a small sample here and tell what compilers (csc1.0, csc1.1,
mcs) it works on and the errors that others give?

Sincerely,
Ben Maurer

OK, I put this in, but anyone who builds on widows with 1.1 is going to
have issues.

We need to get the build system supporting this #if's straight away.
(Tag, you're it).


Good night,
