<PRE>Hello,

	PEAPI does support custom attributes now, or at least they are in the
documentation. 

	I am not sure how reliable PEAPI is yet. From my preliminary use it
seems very good, but I have not done that much testing. Perhaps it would
be best to wait a few months untill the ilasm assembler is completly
done and tested before we make a decision. This would allow us to ensure
it is bug free and do some performance testing.
