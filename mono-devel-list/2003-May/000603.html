<PRE>CORBA may be an option.  Remoting.Corba is an open-source implementation
of CORBA for use with the .NET Remoting infrastructure.  It's probably a
better answer than SOAP for Java/C# integration.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At the moment the only ready to go solution seems to be SOAP but somehow
</I>&gt;<i> SOAP seems a poor match when really what you want is a very tight
</I>&gt;<i> coupling between code written in Java and code written in C#.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When I looked at this problem first I thought about:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. CORBA.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. A Java implementation of .NET remoting.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. A C# implementation of Java RMI.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It was only after trying to look for solutions based around there ideas
</I>&gt;<i> that I fell back on SOAP.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While I found a few products such as JnBridge, iHub and Ja.NET that
</I>&gt;<i> attack the problem by providing a mechanism for Java to work with .NET
</I>&gt;<i> remoting I couldn't find anything in the open-source domain.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I had even less luck with CORBA - I naively assumed Microsoft would be
</I>&gt;<i> providing CORBA bindings for their .NET languages like C# but this
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't seem to be the case.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Similarly I didn't come across anybody trying to get RMI to work with
</I>&gt;<i> C#, either commercial or open-source based.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Have I missed anything - or is this a good summary of the state of
</I>&gt;<i> things at the moment?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I did like the look of Intrinsyc's implementation of .NET remoting for
</I>&gt;<i> Java and it is reasonably priced (at least when used with J2SE - it's
</I>&gt;<i> much more expensive to use with J2EE) but while I'm not a strict
</I>&gt;<i> open-source ideologue I do much prefer to go for solutions where I can
</I>&gt;<i> look at the source.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While quite recent, I wonder if Lluis Sanchez's super work on .NET
</I>&gt;<i> remoting will provide a basis from which to build an open-source
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of .NET remoting for Java? Have people already been
</I>&gt;<i> looking at this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> SOAP, CORBA, remoting and RMI - are there other options to examine?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any thoughts or suggestions would be much appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best wishes - yours,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> George.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PS sorry if you feel this is inappropriate to the development group, I
</I>&gt;<i> posted here as I didn't get the feeling there was already an open source
</I>&gt;<i> solution to what I was thinking about and as such it'd be more the
</I>&gt;<i> subject of future development - something Mono developers might already
</I>&gt;<i> have been thinking about or working on.
