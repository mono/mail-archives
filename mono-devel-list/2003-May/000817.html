I have been doing some experimentation into getting at least mint going on HPUX 11.0 using HP's C compiler and also using 64 bit mode (and this is big endian which makes more difference). I have got things where most of mono/tests pass under mint and also mcs can build itself and reproduce the .exe. I have some experimental changes to the interpreter which speeds it up somewhat (the compiler build has gone from 30 minutes to about 5 minutes) though not all of that is in a releasable state and there may be some reason why some of them are a bad idea.... 

This is all based off 0.24. 

So I have a bunch of changes and fixes that I'd like to start submitting for inclusion into the main version if possible and wasn't sure about the process for this. The areas I had to touch are in metadata, io-layer, arch, interpreter and a few tests themselves and configure.in.There are some differences in how things need to be done using HP's compiler for example you can't have embedded assembly you need separate explicit .s files. Apart from the trampolines and so on the biggest changes were in interp.c itself (some porting some performance).

Anyway I'd like to at least contribute some of the stuff I have found and would like to know how (and I'll probably have questions on how I should relaly do some things).
