Would I be right in thinking that this is purely the &quot;index feature&quot;,
(as in a book index), and that work on &quot;indexing&quot; for the search feature
hasn't yet started? Or are you planning to reuse the same backend for
both features?

A few posts recently are all very ambiguous (without staring at a fair
bit of code) as to which indexing they mean. It appears as if all recent
indexing discussion is to do with creating the index feature, rather
than creating an indexer API for the providers to use to populate data
for the search feature.

I only ask because I have &quot;look at indexing for the search feature&quot; on
my mental todo list for the browser/providers. However, it's something I
don't want to spend a weekend looking at sometime if anyone else ends up
doing a chunk of searching work before I get chance...

Miguel, do you think it would be appropriate to add a line/subsection to
each item in browser/TODO with details of who, if anyone, is working on
each feature?

&gt;<i>   Once the data is populated, a compact index is
</I>&gt;<i> written out.  Then this is used to present a list that the user can
</I>&gt;<i> browser, or can be used to dynamically search the index. 
</I>
Again, I'm a little confused as to whether this means there's now an API
for providers to add data to a search index?

Regards,

Lee.
