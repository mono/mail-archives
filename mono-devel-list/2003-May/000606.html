I think that the best option is what lupus said. I think that a lot of
features needed by palm support that would be very useful in the global
environment. Specific features (like IO) must be iside an assembly (for
example: Mono.Palm.IO) and that assembly can be used by a palm-specific
application. Think that it's great that any application made for
&quot;mono&quot; could run in any architecture.
