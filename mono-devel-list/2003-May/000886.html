Indeed, it needs some time to Expand All nodes. It is, however, only
necessary to do this once. It's not easy to do this in a worker-thread
(when using gtk-sharp). This way the &quot;Expand All&quot; could be made as a
background process.

Agree 
&gt;<i> As for the Index: I have checked in my code for creating an index, but

Sounds like an excellent idea to me

&gt;<i> Now, the shortcomings (and you are free to get involved here):

</I>&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;<i>       * I have not written the widget to display this information.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         Since the index might contain millions of rows, it is not
</I>&gt;<i>         possible to load the information in memory, nor use the
</I>&gt;<i>         standard &quot;Gtk.TreeModel&quot; stores, because it would just consume
</I>&gt;<i>         too much memory to just display.
</I>&gt;<i>         Few options:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>               * Create a wrapper that would allow C# code to implement
</I>&gt;<i>                 the tree models with managed code, without having
</I>&gt;<i>                 to &quot;populate&quot; them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>               * Create a new list-widget (not hard to do, but would be
</I>&gt;<i>                 a duplication of effort) for browsing it.
</I>&gt;<i> So could you rework your patch a bit to cope with this?
</I>&gt;<i> You did a great job.  I wonder if I can get you interested on taking

&gt;<i> some of the other pieces missing in Monodoc (there is a &quot;NOTES&quot; file

Okay,

I have to warn you about my free time that is going to get reduced in a
few days :). I have both a new job and exams coming up within two weeks.
ps. Thats why I gave myself two weeks off (which I am filling with
reading the sources of Mono at this moment -- My new job will be about
.NET and OpenSource, so it wont hurt --)
