<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> For example, the Palm port
</I>&gt;<i> will most likely exist as a stand-alone application (from the PalmOS point
</I>&gt;<i> of view), with threading, interprocess communication, etc being managed by
</I>&gt;<i> that application itself, since the OS provides no support for those
</I>&gt;<i> features.
</I>
So if I understand correctly you're not proposing to do a fork but more like
writting a standalone lib that would implement missing APIs on top of PalmOS?
For example, implementing mono/io-layer (essentially a Win32 subset impl.) using
PalmOS interfaces? So with such a lib in place it would be possible to compile
Mono for PalmOS5 without changing a line in the Mono itself.
Sounds good in theory, but may be extremely difficult in practice.
Besides it's simply not enough to do a port.

&gt;<i> If the entirety of the Mono community is interested enough in
</I>&gt;<i> supporting the PalmOS to make development of these kinds of features (which
</I>&gt;<i> really are only useful on tiny systems) 
</I>
I believe many people on the list will be interested.
This would benefit development for other small systems like WinCE and embedded Linux
(and in the future maybe QNX and Symbian).

&gt;<i> If you *really want* Palm-specific discussions on this list, I'll be happy
</I>&gt;<i> to send them here, but I'm not sure they'll be more than noise to most
</I>&gt;<i> people.
</I>
In any case I agree with Paolo that one of the Mono lists would be a more appropriate
place to talk about this stuff.

Sergey
