<PRE>Ok, most parts of this patch are now in CVS. But I avoided to add extra
size fields.

</I>&gt;<i> unmarshalled byte[] array is always 4.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Also I've found an other bug while hunting down this one. The
</I>&gt;<i> problem is quite simple. I have a fixed size structure and the internal
</I>&gt;<i> size of the last field is computed from the total length of the
</I>&gt;<i> unmanaged data and the offset of the field. This might not always be
</I>&gt;<i> true and there might be trailing bytes because of the layout. I've
</I>&gt;<i> included marshal8.cs to test this. (It also tests bug #42240)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	To fix an other bug (related to the one above), I had to add the
</I>&gt;<i> field &quot;size&quot; in MonoMarshalField and MonoClassField. I had to insert it
</I>&gt;<i> to know the size of fields (particularily the last one). I guess it
</I>&gt;<i> would have been added anyway to handle some kind of field
</I>&gt;<i> reordering/alignment, in case of automatic layout. I guess this update
</I>&gt;<i> needs to be reviewed more than other ones :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	The diff includes all the previous updates (parent's blittable
</I>&gt;<i> state, marshaling of object hierarchy, explicit structure size and
</I>&gt;<i> internal layout fix, OffsetOf fix). It's kinda hard to separate them as
</I>&gt;<i> many of them are related. I pull one off, many others come with it :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Note that all marshal*.cs tests pass successfully (even the
</I>&gt;<i> current marshal7.cs that does not pass with current CVS).
