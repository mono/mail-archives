<PRE>I appreciate that feedback. However, I have to disagree. There are some
features of the Mono core that, as you say, would be useful &quot;across the
board&quot;, but the Palm port will need to be fundamentally different from the
desktop port, and I'm not sure that &quot;peripheral&quot; or &quot;support&quot; code will mean
naything to the vast majority of Mono developers. For example, the Palm port
will most likely exist as a stand-alone application (from the PalmOS point
of view), with threading, interprocess communication, etc being managed by
that application itself, since the OS provides no support for those
features.

I hope the community doesn't split -- there's no need for anything so
drastic. If the entirety of the Mono community is interested enough in
supporting the PalmOS to make development of these kinds of features (which
really are only useful on tiny systems) a general priority, that's great.
But I don't believe that's the case. And rather than waste space in the
mainstream development with development issues of interest only to a single
machine, I thought it'd be useful to collect that machine-specific
development in a different place.

If you *really want* Palm-specific discussions on this list, I'll be happy
to send them here, but I'm not sure they'll be more than noise to most
people.

&gt;<i> Trying to do a fork of mono is a very bad idea: any feature that may be
</I>&gt;<i> needed to run mono on palmos5 is probably a good feature that we want in
</I>&gt;<i> mono anyway (like, reducing memory usage, discarding jitted methods that
</I>&gt;<i> have not been used for a while, more complete ARM porting etc.).
</I>&gt;<i> So, instead of needlessly splitting the community, discussions about the
</I>&gt;<i> port should happen on this list.
