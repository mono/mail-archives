The best way is a diff against the current cvs (though the last release
should be mostly fine).
The options to use with diff are: -u -p -N.
I have the following in my ~/.cvsrc file so that I don't have to
use them all the time:
---cut cut---
cvs -z3
diff -u -p -N
---cut cut---
Note, if you have new files you probably need to attach them to the mail
message, as I think they don't appear with cvs diff unless you do cvs
add first (and that doesn't work with anon cvs).
You can mail the patches to the list (in plain text) or add them as
attachments to a bugzilla report (if you want comments or think we
should comment on the patches send them to the list).
Thanks.
