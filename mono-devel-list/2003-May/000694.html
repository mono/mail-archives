<PRE>I am not sure if this reached the list or not, but I did find a message
on the mailing list about libxslt
(<A HREF="http://archive.neotonic.com/archive/mono-list/msg/12404">http://archive.neotonic.com/archive/mono-list/msg/12404</A>), which says
that downloading the libraries was the right thing.  

I am just curious if the versions below are correct or if this might be
what is causing the hand in Windows while doing the xsl transform?  Also
the program I am using seems to work fine on Red Hat 8 under mono 0.24.

Is anyone using Windows and xml/ xslt transform?  If so are you
experiencing any hangs?  What versions of libxslt and libxml2 are you
using?  Thanks!

Hi,

 

I am building a little utility that downloads an xml (in my case rdf)
file and xslt file and applies the transformation to the xml file.  The
download piece works okay (minus a few work arounds for deserializing my
config file) but then I get to the transform and get some problems.  I
am currently testing this on Windows 2000 with the mono 0.24 setup
binaries while I rebuild my mono install on my Linux box.

 

The first problem is a missing libxslt.dll assembly.  I tried to
download this through cygwin but I kept getting a missing libxslt.dll
error.  I fixed this by downloading libxslt.dll (libxslt-1.0.29.win32)
from <A HREF="http://www.zlatkovic.com/projects/libxml/binaries.html">http://www.zlatkovic.com/projects/libxml/binaries.html</A>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.zlatkovic.com/projects/libxml/binaries.html">http://www.zlatkovic.com/projects/libxml/binaries.html</A>&gt; , which brought
the second problem, a missing method in libxml2.dll
(xmlPathOrderDocElems).  I then downloaded libxml2 (libxml2-2.5.7.win32)
which seemed to fix the missing method problem.

 

When I go to run my utility now though the system seems to cycle for
awhile (5-10 minutes), freezes for a bit and then finally returns.  The
first time it returned I got an error message popup:

            Glib-ERROR **.gmem.c:141:g_malloc (): 

            Failed to allocate 8192 bytes aborting.

 

And I get an abnormal program termination at the command line.

 

So I guess my question is am I using the right xslt libraries?  Also I
was wondering if it would be possible to include them in the setup file?

 

Thanks in advance!

 

 

Clayton Harbour
