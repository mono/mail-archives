<PRE>perhaps someone who has actually built an rpm package can shoot me down,
but:
shouldn't the monodoc rpm installation fail (or complain) if certain
dependencies aren't met?
the rpm -ivh monodoc  went smoothly ... but when I ran monodoc, there
was a neverending list of things (should I call them silent
dependencies?) which kept it from working properly...

to save people the trouble I ran into (which was thankfully figured out
tonight):
if you have a Red Hat 8 (prob also 9) &quot;personal desktop&quot; installation,
make sure to install additionally the gnome *-devel packages. (this
might also affects other installation types)

I also write this here, because there might be a lot of &quot;personal
desktop&quot; users without gnome development experience, who were excited
like me and wanted to jump right into gtk# development
Alright, the GIST:
Shouldn't the monodoc rpm installation complain if you are missing the
devel packages? (it didn't for me). Also I had an issue with
libgtkhtml3... which was also a &quot;silent dependency&quot;
Anyway, the monodoc application is a real treasure for me as I try to
learn gtk#
Thanks!
Philip
