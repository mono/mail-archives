After I got mcs bootstrapping in mono, many months ago, I though
about moving part of the reflection.c code to the managed world.
My plan was to do it after mono 1.0, though. A great deal of
optimizations and bug fixes went into reflection.c and I'm afraid a
rewrite at this point would mean losing a lot. Note that some of the
tweaks are needed to get the Reflection API to output a corlib
assembly, because the standard R.Emit stuff wouldn't allow for that.
Also, at this point, I don't think PEAPI is up to the task, last I
checked it didn't support custom attributes, IIRC.
I'm not sure how much moving the code to the managed world
interfers with the ability to emit and execute code at runtime:
you'd have to change ILGenerator to at least having two backends
(one for fixups for running the code and one for output to PEAPI).
This may have a noticeable overhead in the end, that we'd like to avoid.
Is there a particular reason you want to move the code to the managed
world? If there is no pressing need, I would hold on on this for the
next few months.

Thanks.
