Wow! Great news.

</I>
How difficult do you think is to separate the releasable stuff from the
rest?

&gt;<i> So I have a bunch of changes and fixes that I'd like to start submitting
</I>&gt;<i> for inclusion into the main version if possible and wasn't sure about
</I>&gt;<i> the process for this. The areas I had to touch are in metadata, io-layer,
</I>&gt;<i> arch, interpreter and a few tests themselves and configure.in.There are
</I>&gt;<i> some differences in how things need to be done using HP's compiler for
</I>&gt;<i> example you can't have embedded assembly you need separate explicit .s
</I>&gt;<i> files. Apart from the trampolines and so on the biggest changes were in
</I>&gt;<i> interp.c itself (some porting some performance).
</I>
The best way is to send separate patches for changes that are logically
separate, like:
*) a patch for the arch/hppa directory (codegen and trampoline)
*) a patch for io-layer
*) a patch for 64bit or endian issues in metadata
*) a patch for the test cases
*) a patch for configure.in and the build issues

If the interp changes are both endianess/64bit issues and performance
enhancements, do you think you can split them? It would make it easier
to merge in the changes that way.

&gt;<i> Anyway I'd like to at least contribute some of the stuff I have found
</I>&gt;<i> and would like to know how (and I'll probably have questions on how I
</I>&gt;<i> should relaly do some things).
</I>
Feel free to ask any questions on this list.
Thanks!
