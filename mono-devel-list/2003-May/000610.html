<PRE>yes, I believe it's possible in theory, under certain constraints. memory on
the Palm is not protected (in the conventional sense of process-protected
memory). the OS is allowed to shuffle blocks of memory around pretty much at
any time, which means that pointers can be easily invalidated. to prevent
this, there's a &quot;lock&quot; call that is used to fix a block of memory (such as a
resource chunk) to prevent it moving until it's no longer needed. in
addition, the calling context of the 'genned code has to be known -- it's
nontrivial to access application-global or application-local variable
storage from an ARM routine.

so...if the 'genned code were to be called from inside an ARM routine, and
didn't access any variable storage outside that routine, and didn't need any
OS support while it was running, and was of a known maximum length before it
was called, then it should be possible to run it on the Palm.

&gt;<i> BTW, is it possible at all (under PalmOS5) to generate ARM code
</I>on-the-fly.
&gt;<i> If it's possible but requires some PalmOS specific code to be added to the
</I>codegen
&gt;<i> then I will be happy to integrate such changes - would be a good start and
</I>since
&gt;<i> codegen is generally useable outside of Mono adding Palm-ism seems fine
</I>and useful
&gt;<i> in this case.
