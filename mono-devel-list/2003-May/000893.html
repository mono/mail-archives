<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Would I be right in thinking that this is purely the &quot;index feature&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> (as in a book index), and that work on &quot;indexing&quot; for the search feature
</I>&gt;<i> hasn't yet started? Or are you planning to reuse the same backend for
</I>&gt;<i> both features?
</I>
This is purely an index/table-of-contents feature.  The search engine
should use its own body-text indexing.

&gt;<i> A few posts recently are all very ambiguous (without staring at a fair
</I>&gt;<i> bit of code) as to which indexing they mean. It appears as if all recent
</I>&gt;<i> indexing discussion is to do with creating the index feature, rather
</I>&gt;<i> than creating an indexer API for the providers to use to populate data
</I>&gt;<i> for the search feature.
</I>
It has both currently: the populating API is there, and the code to
write it out to disk is there.

This is only used to implement the panel on the left in this screenshot:

&gt;<i> Miguel, do you think it would be appropriate to add a line/subsection to
</I>&gt;<i> each item in browser/TODO with details of who, if anyone, is working on
</I>&gt;<i> each feature?
</I>
Yes, that makes sense.  

&gt;<i> Again, I'm a little confused as to whether this means there's now an API
</I>&gt;<i> for providers to add data to a search index?
</I>
There is an API for adding data to the table-of-contents index.

Miguel

</PRE>
