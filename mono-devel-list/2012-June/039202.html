<PRE>A pull request on github would probably be simplest. We can review,
comment and merge from the web interface which simplifies the workflow
and ensures the commit doesn't get lost. I assume you're familiar with
how to do pull requests, but in case you aren't you just have to:

1) Fork mono on github
2) Create a new branch in your fork with all the change you want in
your pull request
3) Submit a pull request for that branch
