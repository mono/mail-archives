That's ok I guess, and i guess i also agree that WPF is dying if not dead.

I have one WPF app i wrote (an administation tool for a website, 
basically a photo and description uploader).  I had already started 
porting that to GTK# (I got as far as prompting the user for a database 
login and confirming that login on the remote server), which is when i 
ran into my first bug about a month ago and decided rather than work on 
porting my project I'd work on getting mono more functional first.

One thing i'd love to see in gtk# though, and i don't know if i'm going 
to have to write this myself, is an html editor control.  It doesn't 
have to be super complex, maybe something like a rich text editor which 
supports fonts that could convert just things like bold, italic, and 
underline to html.  In WinForms i was able to use a free 
HtmlEditor-control which was based on a WebBrowser control, but i don't 
think a webbrowser control is an option with mono.
