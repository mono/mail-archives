<PRE>I was talking about the&#160;Remove_Owned test that was modified by the previously enclosed patch.
I've encountered no failures with the&#160;OneClickComboBoxCell test in the form that it exists in the git repo.

Steven, about the strange test issues you mentioned, were you talking about
the OneClickComboBoxCell method, or not? Because I just realized this test
passes when run individually, but fails when run along with others.
