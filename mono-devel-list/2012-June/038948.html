<PRE>Wow...open-source helps me keep my sanity too, though not as directly as it helps you! :-)
More power to you...I would like to be able to retire &amp; just work on open-source code all day. &#160;You're living my dream. :-)

-Steve

</I>I guess that is a luxury i have ;-)..&#160; i don't/can't work anymore since i lost my mind.&#160; I have something they call schizoaffective disorder, which is the 'best of both worlds': I'm schizophrenic and i'm bipolar..&#160; But physically i'm fine, i just can't keep a job because, for example, paranoia in my last full time job caused me to stop showing up to work because i was convinced the boss was going to hang me (Yes, i thought i would die.. The funny thing is, if i think about it, he had nothing negative to say about me).&#160; It had someting to do with the fact that he was the C.E.O. i reported to, and 'executive' sounded in my disturbed mine like 'executioner'.&#160; Oh, I'm full of stories, but this is the wrong place for them..

Suffice it to say, I now have plenty of time for hobbies like this.&#160;
    I can't afford rent or anything, but i get about $2,000/month from
    the government plus medical insurance to sit around and do
    nothing....

p.s. Working on mono has been good for me, i haven't had a
    hallucination in at least 2 weeks, which my therapist was really
    impressed with (she was the one who pointed it out, because i always
    e-mail her when i experience something odd).&#160; Goes to show the
    reason i went from just a mild mood disorder when i was working to
    full blown schizophrenia was that i wasn't keeping busy enough.&#160;
    Keeping busy here is good for me.
