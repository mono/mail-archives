<PRE>Well, that sample ran fine on my side, so I guess we have a problem. &#160;Any idea how to resolve this issue?

Re: using themes...sure, that's a long-term solution, but since mono-winforms is no longer officially supported, and Microsoft has moved on to WPF, I'd say the chances of this happening are between slim and none. &#160;Still...enclosed is a newer version of the same patch, one that uses&#160;ThemeEngine.Current.ColorGrayText instead.

Please let me know if there's anything else I need to do on this bug, especially since it's a visual change &amp; so it's pretty much impossible to make a unit test for it.

BTW, I couldn't find any bug reports for this issue.

Steven Boswell

Subject: Re: [Mono-dev] Patches for mono-winforms
 
The one solution I uploaded doesn't have the hang, but it has the
never-called event handler.
I haven't tried anything else since then.

I did notice issues with the disabled look of some controls, too (probably
have some related bug reports still up on Novell bugzilla). I think this
should all be handled within System.Windows.Forms.Theming, but it's not
always the case with existing code. Ideally, we should gradually move
theme-related code from System.Windows.Forms to
System.Windows.Forms.Theming. Just saying that for the information, not
saying we should do both fixing and moving things in the same patch.
