<PRE>Once I get done with this round of WinForms bug-fixing, I plan to get back to my original project -- C# bindings to the Qt application-building library.

Recently, the kde-bindings list's &quot;Qyoto&quot; project reached an important milestone -- the current code builds and runs on both Linux and MS Windows. (That took FOREVER, and I learned a lot about cmake in the process.)

However, Qyoto involves several levels of indirection between C# and Qt, and so I've been looking at mono-cxxi, given its relative leanness. &#160;(For one thing, I have a better chance of getting my head wrapped around mono-cxxi's source code, since there's so much less of it. :-)

That's ok I guess, and i guess i also agree that WPF is dying if not dead.

I have one WPF app i wrote (an administation tool for a website, basically a photo and description uploader).&#160; I had already started porting that to GTK# (I got as far as prompting the user for a database login and confirming that login on the remote server), which is when i ran into my first bug about a month ago and decided rather than work on porting my project I'd work on getting mono more functional first.

One thing i'd love to see in gtk# though, and i don't know if i'm going to have to write this myself, is an html editor control.&#160; It doesn't have to be super complex, maybe something like a rich text editor which supports fonts that could convert just things like bold, italic, and underline to html.&#160; In WinForms i was able to use a free HtmlEditor-control which was based on a WebBrowser control, but i don't think a webbrowser control is an option with mono.
