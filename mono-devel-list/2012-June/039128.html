<PRE>My master branch contains two unrelated winforms changes (one change for
idle, one change for DataGrid - not DataGridView don't worry i'm not
duplicating work), it's becoming clear that they are not going to
receive priority and i have no problem with that.

But i do have at least one non-winforms fix which i'd like to at least
get reviewed.  That's not going to happen since the winforms changes
have to go thru first.

Is it considered a safe thing to:
1) Backup the files that i changed for each fix
2) Delete my fork
3) Create a new fork
4) Create branches for each change and submit them separately

I think this would help me get past my current state of 'i can't really
do anything until my master branch is approved or rejected'...

I probably won't do this today, but if I don't hear back i might do that
sometime this week.

-Rob
