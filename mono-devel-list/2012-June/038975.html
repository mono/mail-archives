<PRE>I submitted two unrelated fixes on the same pull request today which had 
other fixes queued.  I know that makes it more complicated to pull in 
the changes if they're determined to be acceptable in the end, but it 
was a cold and rainy day here today so i was stuck inside ....

Here are the two i addressed today :
<A HREF="https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=5511">https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=5511</A> (I reported and fixed 
this)
<A HREF="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=322563">https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=322563</A> (i addressed part of 
it, i think the rest may already be addressed, but there is a slight 
imperfection with that part which i'm not sure how to fix just yet).

Tomorrow's weather doesn't look much better, but as of this moment i 
have nothing else that i'm working on, and i'm not going to start 
something new between now and bedtime.

-Rob

p.s. I know i don't need to contact the list with this stuff, but 
yesterday i sent six messages to the list, so if i didn't send at least 
one today (this one) i figured someone might think i died or something.
