<PRE>Enclosed is a new patch, mostly for discussion purposes, since there's no unit test &amp; I don't know how I would write one for this.

Today, after using my application in a particular way, I got it to crash, putting up an &quot;Exception caught&quot; window. &#160;I can't reproduce the problem outside of running it in the MonoDevelop debugger, and there appears to be no way to copy the contents of the stack-trace tab in the exception-caught window (really? how the heck did THIS get missed?), so I can't post the full details. &#160;But it starts at System.ComponentModel.Finalize() with a tool-strip-item (the one I selected seconds before the crash), and ends in System.Drawing.GDIPlus.CheckStatus(Status), where it reports &quot;A null reference or invalid value was found [GDI+ status: InvalidParameter]&quot;.

I have no idea why a copy of my menu-item is getting finalized; I certainly didn't make a copy of it. &#160;The good news is, this crash is consistently repeatable, if I just use my application in the same certain order.

Digging through the stack trace, I arrived at System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripItem.set_InternalOwner, where the owner was being set to null, and right afterwards,&#160;CalculateAutoSize() was being called. &#160;Why would anyone need to calculate the size of a menu-item that isn't even connected to a menu any more? &#160;So, for me, the bug fix was obvious: check if the owner isn't null before calling&#160;CalculateAutoSize(). &#160;That's what the enclosed patch does.

With this patch, the bug doesn't reproduce, and the menu-item I selected is still there and doing fine.

Any thoughts on the correctness of this bug fix? &#160;Or how one would write a unit test for it? &#160;Or how to copy the contents of the stack-trace tab in MonoDevelop's exception-caught window?
