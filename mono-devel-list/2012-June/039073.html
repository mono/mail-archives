<PRE>Just to make sure, you mean you get these issues with .NET, with Mono, or
with both?
Anyway, to clear things up, as far as GDI+ and WinForms are concerned, the
goal is to be as compatible with them as possible, not to make something
better or more powerful. Ideally, the same things should work or fail on
each framework. We don't want things that work only on Mono and not with
.NET, especially for compatibility stacks like these.

</I>&gt;<i> may have been a factor).    This only happened on Win32, and caused 
</I>&gt;<i> crashes in the apps when it occurred.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If there really is an issue with gdi+ objects being busy because they 
</I>&gt;<i> are being accessed from both threads, then perhaps (and i haven't looked 
</I>&gt;<i> at the code yet) -- well, perhaps the calls to gdi+ should be made 
</I>&gt;<i> thread safe or at least thread &quot;safer&quot;.  i.e. Something as simple as 
</I>&gt;<i> creating a gdi+ lock or something similar, and before anything tries to 
</I>&gt;<i> access gdi+ acquire the lock (at least on win32, which is the only place 
</I>&gt;<i> this seemed to be an issue).  IT should be better to make an app wait 
</I>&gt;<i> for a thread to finish using gdi+ (wait for the lock) then for otherwise 
</I>&gt;<i> the application to crash altogether in a WmPaint command.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> i know winforms, unofficially offically, is dead, but this seems like a 
</I>&gt;<i> simple enough thing to try to correct.
