<PRE>Steven,

What I like to do with generating unit tests (and i'm new to this too) 
is this;
(1) before making any changes, clone the git tree twice, one i put in a  
directory called 'mono-orig', the other i just put in 'monosrc'.  I like 
to pre-compile them both long in advance, so when i make changes later 
the 'make' and 'make install' get done a lot quicker.
(2) All my changes go into monosrc, i tend to leave mono-orig untouched.
(3) When i generate unit tests, I clone those tests into the mono-orig 
directory tree. Then i run the tests 'before' any changes and 'with' the 
changes.  That is, the test should fail without any changes, otherwise 
they don't demonstrate that your patch did anything.  They, obviously, 
should pass when they have your changes in them.

I know Stifu said this, but I just wanted to share how i did it.
