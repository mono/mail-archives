</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The order to apply them in (then i'll get into what it fixes after):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd suggest the DataGrid patches first because they are in the middle

</I>&gt;<i> IdleAndDataGrid.Whitespace.Jun10.patch until you've applied ALL the
</I>&gt;<i> patches prior to Jun 10 (including idle patches), those patches in the
</I>&gt;<i> Whitespace patch don't fix anything other the prettying up the code,
</I>&gt;<i> but they depend on both set of patches in sequence..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the sequence i'm suggesting they must be applied in if they are
</I>&gt;<i> applied at all are:
</I>&gt;<i> (1) DataGrid1.Jun3.patch first
</I>&gt;<i> (2) DataGrid2.Jun4.patch second
</I>&gt;<i> (3) DataGrid3.Novell322563.jun4.patch third
</I>&gt;<i> (4) DataGrid4.Novell322154.jun6.patch
</I>&gt;<i> -- but don't do the other one i said not to do at this point --
</I>&gt;<i> now to the idle fixes, these next ones (5-9) are meant to all be
</I>&gt;<i> applied as part of essentially one patch for it to work, but is broken
</I>&gt;<i> up so you can see progression.
</I>&gt;<i> (5) Idle1-3.Jun2 (sorry for forgetting patch extension), This contains
</I>&gt;<i> 3 commits in one but they were all related, and makes life easier by
</I>&gt;<i> being summarized into one like this.
</I>&gt;<i> (6) Now you should do IdleAndDataGrid.Whitespace.Jun10.patch
</I>&gt;<i> (7) Next, do Idle-Win32IdleEnable.jun11.patch
</I>&gt;<i> (8) Idle-RaceConditionFix-Jun12.patch is next
</I>&gt;<i> (9) Idle-TestFixForIdle.jun12.patch is last
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There, I have 9 attachments, and above is the sequence to apply them in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The below numbering system matches the above patch order
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #1: from the commit message:
</I>&gt;<i> The sample code in
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=MONO79788">https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=MONO79788</A> was crashing on
</I>&gt;<i> me if I clicked on a row header (where the + was). I investigated and
</I>&gt;<i> found that it was because, when the table had no data to display yet,
</I>&gt;<i> and if you clicked on a row header (that's the area to the left of
</I>&gt;<i> what would be the data), as part of assigning the current cell, it
</I>&gt;<i> would call ensure cell visibility function, which would call
</I>&gt;<i> ScrollToColumnInPixels which would try to get the next pixel offset by
</I>&gt;<i> looking at CurrentTableStyle.GridColumnStyles[CurrentColumn].Width,
</I>&gt;<i> but when no data was being displayed there were no columns. So while
</I>&gt;<i> current column had a value of zero, there were no items in the
</I>&gt;<i> GridColumnStyles Array/List, even at zero index. The fix for this was
</I>&gt;<i> before indexing into GridColumnStyles to Check The Length to make sure
</I>&gt;<i> we're not going beyond its bounds. It is probably perfectly acceptable
</I>&gt;<i> if we're beyond the bounds to just leave this value at zero for the
</I>&gt;<i> offset.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #2 From the commit message:
</I>&gt;<i> Xamaring bug 5511: This fixes this and some side issues..
</I>&gt;<i> First, fixed the crash by creating two additional stacks for when
</I>&gt;<i> navigating to and from other sub tables... Both were 'style' stacks
</I>&gt;<i> which tracked per column styles. Those needed to be updated and reset
</I>&gt;<i> on a per table basis. Second, When navigating forward or back, EndEdit
</I>&gt;<i> needed to be called so that we don't leave an editing cell open when
</I>&gt;<i> we navigate, otherwise there was the possibility and reality that the
</I>&gt;<i> edited cell would still be visible and editing on the next table
</I>&gt;<i> either forward or back. To recreate this on the sample code, presuming
</I>&gt;<i> you can get past the initial crash which was fixed here, this could be
</I>&gt;<i> illustrated without the endedits that were added as follows : Run: 1.
</I>&gt;<i> click + 2. click pb 3. click + 4. click pb 3. click + 5. click pd 6.
</I>&gt;<i> click back 6. click pc 7. See 0 highlighted in column header from
</I>&gt;<i> previous table Finally, I modified some previous submissions on a
</I>&gt;<i> related problem so that they had more &quot;Love for Spaces&quot; (whitespace)
</I>&gt;<i> without changing the actual code other than that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The above may have fixed, i think it was 5510 too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #3: From the commit
</I>&gt;<i> This solves PART of Novell Bugzilla Issue #322563
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=322563">https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=322563</A> What this
</I>&gt;<i> accomplishes is that it hides the non browsable columns (columns that
</I>&gt;<i> were not part of the original dataset, in the test case) from view in
</I>&gt;<i> the DataGrid. Unfortunately, i can't see an obvious way to hide
</I>&gt;<i> the'parent rows' display of those non browsable columns value. That is
</I>&gt;<i> if You viewed a subtable off hidden field pb_Id=0 it would show that
</I>&gt;<i> value (pb_Id=0) on the top of the datagrid where it shows the previous
</I>&gt;<i> rows. The remaining issue seems to be a non major issue since it is a
</I>&gt;<i> non functional issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #4: From the commit
</I>&gt;<i> Novell #323154
</I>&gt;<i> Decided to include this in same branch (same pull request) as earlier
</I>&gt;<i> changes due to it affecting the same DataGrid.cs -- i didn't want any
</I>&gt;<i> conflicts. Here's a copy of what i wrote up earlier about this: the
</I>&gt;<i> problem report is here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=323154">https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=323154</A> I found by
</I>&gt;<i> deduction that the repaint wasn't cancelling the active edit box after
</I>&gt;<i> the row was deleted .. So while the table updated, the edit box with
</I>&gt;<i> the old value didn't go away... The repaint was initiated from an
</I>&gt;<i> Invalidate call which stack trace looked something like this:
</I>&gt;<i> System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid.CalcAreasAndInvalidate() at
</I>&gt;<i> System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid.RecreateDataGridRows(Boolean recalc) at
</I>&gt;<i> System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid.OnListManagerItemChanged(System.Object
</I>&gt;<i> sender, System.Windows.Forms.ItemChangedEventArgs e) at
</I>&gt;<i> System.Windows.Forms.CurrencyManager.OnItemChanged(System.Windows.Forms.ItemChangedEventArgs
</I>&gt;<i> e) at System.Windows.Forms.CurrencyManager.UpdateIsBinding() at
</I>&gt;<i> System.Windows.Forms.CurrencyManager.ListChangedHandler(System.Object
</I>&gt;<i> sender, System.ComponentModel.ListChangedEventArgs e) at
</I>&gt;<i> System.Data.DataView.OnListChanged(System.ComponentModel.ListChangedEventArgs
</I>&gt;<i> e) at System.Data.DataView.OnRowDeleted(System.Object sender,
</I>&gt;<i> System.Data.DataRowChangeEventArgs args) at
</I>&gt;<i> System.Data.DataTable.OnRowDeleted(System.Data.DataRowChangeEventArgs
</I>&gt;<i> e) at System.Data.DataTable.DeletedDataRow(System.Data.DataRow dr,
</I>&gt;<i> DataRowAction action) at System.Data.DataRow.Delete() at
</I>&gt;<i> System.Data.DataView.Delete(Int32 index) at
</I>&gt;<i> System.Data.DataRowView.Delete() at grid.ProcessCmdKey(Message ByRef
</I>&gt;<i> msg, Keys keyData) (etc) ProcessCmdKey is from user code in sample in
</I>&gt;<i> bug report... After the delete (as seen above), the first thing the
</I>&gt;<i> DataGrid gets back is an OnListManagerItemChanged... Before that would
</I>&gt;<i> call RecreateDataGridRows(), if it was going to do that, i inserted a
</I>&gt;<i> check to see if we're editing, and if so, i cancel the edit (because
</I>&gt;<i> we're reloading dataset), here is a summary of what my patch will look
</I>&gt;<i> like in ONListManagerItemChanged in DataGrid.cs in
</I>&gt;<i> System.Windows.Forms directory: if (rows == null || RowsCount !=
</I>&gt;<i> rows.Length - (ShowEditRow ? 1 : 0)) + { + if (is_editing) +
</I>&gt;<i> CancelEditing (); RecreateDataGridRows (true); + } This solved the
</I>&gt;<i> problem reported. It is now identical to windows .net behavior from
</I>&gt;<i> what i can see, as far as this problem report goes anyway. MS .NET
</I>&gt;<i> Crashes as well as mono in the sample code if you press a key twice to
</I>&gt;<i> delete two rows when there was only one row to delete (index out of
</I>&gt;<i> range). This is not necessarily a good thing, but it's user code from
</I>&gt;<i> the bug report which causes that, not anything inherently different in
</I>&gt;<i> mono.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #5-#9 are all about fixing bug From Novell #321541 which if i have the
</I>&gt;<i> right number is adding the ability to have the idle event handler only
</I>&gt;<i> send idle events to the thread the idle handler was assigned in.  So
</I>&gt;<i> if you have 2 threads, and they each assigned an idle event handler,
</I>&gt;<i> they would each get their own idle event handler called when that
</I>&gt;<i> thread went idle.  Or if only one thread had an idle event handler
</I>&gt;<i> assigned that same idle handler wouldn't be called for EVERY thread,
</I>&gt;<i> it would only be called on the thread it was assigned on.  This is so
</I>&gt;<i> it more closely matches the windows .net behavior.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll include each of the individual commit messages though they were
</I>&gt;<i> all towards the same goal
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #5 had three commits:
</I>&gt;<i> This addresses a 6-year old Novell bugzilla issue: 321541...
</I>&gt;<i> Created a hashtable of per-thread event handlers for idle.. Assigned in
</I>&gt;<i> to that hashtable when the regular Idle eventhandler was assigned by
</I>&gt;<i> mapping it by ManagedThreadId. The hashtable had to use a separate
</I>&gt;<i> object (different class) rather than an EventHandler directly, because
</I>&gt;<i> an eventhandler apparently cannot be assigned to another object, it
</I>&gt;<i> can only be a part of a class. It also couldn't be checked for null or
</I>&gt;<i> called from outside the class so i handled that as appropriate (by
</I>&gt;<i> secondary callers). This has been checked against the code in 321541
</I>&gt;<i> and the code appears to work fine now. I have also confirmed no new
</I>&gt;<i> unit test failures have been introduced by this change. There were 3
</I>&gt;<i> failures before, and are three failures now. Also, This includes a
</I>&gt;<i> unit test, which will fail without this patch. Here's a shortcut to
</I>&gt;<i> the Novell bug: <A HREF="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=321541">https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=321541</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Per suggestion, Changed a Hashtable to a generic dictionary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This change is to properly use the GenericDictionary to use
</I>&gt;<i> the EventHandler type directly rather than the temporary class that
</I>&gt;<i> was being used in my first attempt at this.
</I>&gt;<i> (so some of the changes from the first commit you don't see here
</I>&gt;<i> because they were thrown away by the second and third in a rewrite)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #6 is a bunch of whitespace fixes for Datagrid and idle which has to
</I>&gt;<i> be applied at this point in sequence.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #7 Enables the idle message to work on Win32.  When i tested on Win32
</I>&gt;<i> i realized the Idle event handler was never called, so i fixed that so
</I>&gt;<i> when it went idle it would call it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's the commit from #7:
</I>&gt;<i> This patch will enable the idle event to be called when the applicati&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i> &#8230;on is idle on Win32. This was necessary to make an earlier unit test
</I>&gt;<i> from the same set of patches work on win32. Plus, it's a good idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #8 This is important, essentially this had a lock set to stop a race
</I>&gt;<i> condition that was happening with the test. There was an 'if something
</I>&gt;<i> == null assign something to something new... And two threads were
</I>&gt;<i> hitting this code at the same time and this was causing one thread to
</I>&gt;<i> assign it, and before it would start working with it, thread 2 would
</I>&gt;<i> reassign it, and this resulted in a stack dump (exception) in
</I>&gt;<i> add_Idle, this fix seemed to stop that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's the commit message
</I>&gt;<i> This code fixes a possible race condition which during my testing seemed
</I>&gt;<i> to be hit about once every twenty runs or so. Sometimes if two threads
</I>&gt;<i> were assigning the idle handler at the same time, and it's the first
</I>&gt;<i> assignment, they will both try to assign a new dictionary. This
</I>&gt;<i> resulted in funny behavior, such as immediately after an add, the item
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't be found. After applying this fix, a lock around that
</I>&gt;<i> particular check/assignment, I reran the tests about 50-75 times and
</I>&gt;<i> never ran into this race condition again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #9 the last one is just some test changes after what i was told about
</I>&gt;<i> mono requiring that all threads create the forms in the same thread.
</I>&gt;<i> This only seemed to be a problem on windows, from what i recall, and
</I>&gt;<i> only occasionally.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The commit message reads:
</I>&gt;<i> Due to a WinForms requriement (which only seems to occasionally be a
</I>&gt;<i> problem on Windows), where all Controls (including Forms) must be
</I>&gt;<i> created on One Thread, and then to do work on them from other threads
</I>&gt;<i> only by use of invoke ( According to :
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/FAQ:_Winforms">http://www.mono-project.com/FAQ:_Winforms</A> ), I modified my unit test
</I>&gt;<i> accordingly to be in compliance.
