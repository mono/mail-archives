<PRE>I am not an expert, just have a suggestion, and i don't know that my
suggestion is any better than your solution.  But i figure it couldn't
hurt to share.

&gt;<i>From what i saw someone replied to your message here about how to do it:
</I><A HREF="https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-list/2012-June/msg00023.html">https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-list/2012-June/msg00023.html</A>

The realloc's i agree may be bad, so not knowing anything else, i wonder
if you couldn't pre-alloc a buffer up front of length x 2 (from 8 bit to
16 bit in theory is double size, presuming that's the difference between
utf8 and utf16 and i don't know).

Something like (and this is pseudo code, untested, and probably won't
work anywhere near as written)

buf = malloc (length * 2);
memset(buf,0,length*2);
bufpos=0;
while (bufpos &lt;= length) {
  ut =
g_utf8_to_utf16(text+bufpos,length,&amp;bytes_read,&amp;words_written,&amp;error);
  if (there is an error) break;
  memcpy(buf+(bufpos*2), ut,
(bytes_read&lt;(length-bufpos)?bytes_read*2:(length-bufpos)*2);
  bufpos+=((bytes_read+1)*2);
}

That was pulled out of my head, and i am not familiar enough with utf
strings to know if it would work.  I'm just guessing your converting
from something that's 8 bits to something that's 16 bits so it would be
length*2 to alloc.

Use my code above more as a guide of what _i_ have in mind whether or
not it is right, someone else should feel free to correct me.

I am _not_ an expert, just a newbie with a little bit of c programming
experience in my very distant past.

</I>&gt;<i>
