<PRE>I don't know if there are any written, official rules on this subject, but...

1- You may just contact the assignee and ask him/her what's up (you should
be able to grab his/her e-mail address from the bug report)
2- If the bug has been assigned to someone for months or years, it's
probably safe to steal the job... If in doubt, again, just contact him/her

And lastly, yes, you can contribute to any part of Mono. Again, don't
hesitate to contact the concerned people first, to make sure you're not
wasting your time or stepping on someone else's toes.
