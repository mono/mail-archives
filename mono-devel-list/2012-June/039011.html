<PRE>Maybe you're running an older version of my unit test, before I added code that ensured the event-handler was being called. &#160;I've attached a fresh copy of patch #1.

Enclosed is a reworked version of patch #4, one whose behavior has been tested against .NET. &#160;Apply the unit test patch, see that you get a unit test failure, then apply my patch, and see that the unit test no longer fails. &#160;Also enclosed is a ComboBoxTest project containing the unit test, so you can run it under .NET easily.

Also, I noticed that bringing up a dialog box before calling Application.Run() tends to make Mono freak out. &#160;Maybe that's the problem with your DgwTest project? &#160;The enclosed ComboBoxTest project waits until the Form's Load event to bring up dialog boxes.

I will go and redo patch #3 so that it works under .NET, and try to come up with unit tests for patches 2 and 7. &#160;Those require user interaction...if I can figure out how to fake a mouse click, I should be able to do this. &#160;Looks like the accepted method is to create a subclass and then call OnMouseClick() directly.

&quot;Um...you're not supposed to get the &quot;Event handler!&quot; message-box with an
unpatched Mono. &#160;The patch's main purpose is to make sure that event handler
gets called. &#160;Or do I misunderstand what you're saying?&quot;

Then isn't the test wrong? If the event handler doesn't get executed, then
the unit test still passes. I just tried commenting the event handler and
run the test with .NET, and it passes.

By the way, I think there may have been issues with patch 3... Now the
concerned 2 tests (SelectedColumnsTest and SelectedRowsTest) don't pass
anymore with .NET, it seems.

I get: 1-14
&#160; Expected: 0
&#160; But was:&#160; 2

Can you confirm? I did stumble across this error while reviewing your patch,
but then I thought it ended up passing. I must have made a mistake
somewhere.

I didn't actually find your GitHub account, just referenced your e-mail
address and that's it. :p
C# Qt bindings is a cool project. I was gonna mention CXXI, but you already
know about it.
