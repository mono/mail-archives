<PRE>Now that I have all of the Winforms patches (for Datagrid and Idle)
extracted into individual patches -- which i did for the earlier e-mail,
I can clean them up and submit them one at a time, to github, if that
would be preferred?  OR I could submit them, one at a time (i.e. as we
get to them), to this mailing list, if that would be preferred?  I
suggest one at a time, because i noticed earlier that a change in one
commit will break the application of the other patches to the same
file(s).  When i say one at a time, i mean one datagrid patch at a time,
and one idle patch at a time (if not just one idle patch altogether,
since they are essentially one patch).

There is absolutely no rush either way, these patches in most cases have
been in the problem report database for years.  I just want to make the
job as easy as possible for whomever winds up reviewing them, whenever
they get to them, whether it's stifu or someone else if he genuinely
does decide to quit because of me :-( .
