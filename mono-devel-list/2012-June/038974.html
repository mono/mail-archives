<PRE>Thank you!

Is there any chance of getting my previous two bug fixes pushed into the 2.10 release branch?
I figure that's the fastest way to get them into the versions found in yum repositories.

And what differences did you notice? &#160;I'll at least put them on my list of things to consider.

I just tried to run your&#160;DgwTest project, both with latest mono, and with my patched 2.10.5 installation, under Fedora Core 16. &#160;I compiled it with 2.10.5, and it ran fine with both versions of mono. &#160;I then compiled it with latest mono, and it ran fine with latest mono. &#160;So I don't know what to tell you.


BTW, enclosed is an updated version of patch 2. &#160;I noticed the problem while debugging my own application today. &#160;DataGridView.EndEdit(DataGridViewDataErrorContexts context) calls Focus(); there are no source-code comments to explain why, but my best guess is that it's to force the current editing-control to unfocus, since there is no explicit method to unfocus a control in WinForms. &#160;Unfortunately, that's not the sort of thing you want to happen while processing a Leave event. &#160;In addition, DataGridView.EndEdit(DataGridViewDataErrorContexts&#160;context) doesn't yet do anything with the passed-in&#160;DataGridViewDataErrorContexts parameter. &#160;So my new patch keeps the call to EndEdit() that I added to DataGridView.OnLeave(), but with a parameter of&#160;DataGridViewDataErrorContexts.LeaveControl, and in EndEdit(), I guard the call to Focus() with &quot;if (context != DataGridViewDataErrorContexts.LeaveControl)&quot;. &#160;That seems a lot more sensible, and the problem I
 was having with my application went away. It's still not suitable for check-in, what with missing a unit test and all, but I wanted to keep all interested parties up to date on my progress.

Finally, in case anyone is interested, here are two more mono-winforms bugs I noticed today, that I'll probably try to fix at some point:

1) Modifying DataGridViewComboBoxColumn.Items doesn't propagate the changes to its cells, like it does in .NET. &#160;Mono will propagate changes made to DataGridViewComboBoxCell.Items to its owning column, though.
2) The value of the Control.Focused property isn't consistent during an OnLeave event. &#160;Under .NET, it appears to always be false. &#160;Under Mono, I've seen both true and false.

Thanks to all for putting up with me. :-)

Steven Boswell

I've just pushed patch 3
(<A HREF="https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/bcb49c60cdb9e9797fa91473955fe71828805643">https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/bcb49c60cdb9e9797fa91473955fe71828805643</A>).
Thanks.

By the way, I have noticed a few remaining subtle differences with .NET, but
I guess we have enough on our hands as is...
