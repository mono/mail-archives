<PRE>I was not implying that you were writing too much, just trying to give you
all the info you might need.

  I was not aware of that (probably because i don't get those e-mails).  I
apologize for writing too much.

I'm not working on any current issues, hopefully it'll be quiet from me for
a while.

 Just so you are aware, many of the devs will be emailed by github when a
pull request is created with all of the necessary info. I'm not saying
don't email the list about it, just wanting to make sure you knew that
notification happens.

Subject: [Mono-dev] Patch for 6 year old bug ;-) - Submitted to github

 Ok, I just submitted to github my patch for a 6 year old bug.  I'm a
little uncomfortable with not being able to test on every possible
platform, but i don't really have all the platforms available to me.  I
confirmed it works well enough on X11.  I also included unit tests.

I fully understand if it takes another 6 years to be accepted.

If anyone wants to review it and has a github account, it's here:
 <A HREF="https://github.com/mono/mono/pull/312">https://github.com/mono/mono/pull/312</A>
You should be able to see the code changes.

Feel free to leave a comment there if you're unhappy with the way i did
something.
