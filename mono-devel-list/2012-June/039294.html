<PRE>I managed to get XSP to build on MacOSX but it was not pretty.

When i downloaded it from git (<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">git at github.com</A>:mono/xsp) autogen was
failing at the configure script.  What i did was just comment out the
parts that were failing, then build and install and i was left with a
working fresh compiled XSP.

I had another issue though: It wasn't using my development version of
mono (which the environment variables were pointing at), it was using
(it appeared) the system-wide installed version.  That probably had
something to do with the lines i commented out of the configure script
which had to do with detecting mono and mono installed assemblies.

I think i saw the latest patch to XSP was 4 months ago, so i wonder if
it's still being maintained or no one knew of the mac issues, or, more
likely, i'm missing a parameter to autogen.sh (I didn't _see_ anything
about it in a README but i might've missed it).
