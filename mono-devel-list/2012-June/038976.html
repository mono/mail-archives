<PRE>I'm sure we're all glad you didn't die. :-)

Cold...rain...sounds nice. &#160;It's 6:30pm here and still 90 degrees outside with zero humidity. &#160;Oh, the joys of the high desert. &#160;Something tells me I'm going to get a lot of open-source programming done in the next four months.

A six year old bug, huh? &#160;Mono _is_ competing with Microsoft! &#160;ROTFL

Subject: [Mono-dev] I'm probably extending the delay on my pull request by doing this, but..
 

I submitted two unrelated fixes on the same pull request today which had other fixes queued.&#160; I know that makes it more complicated to pull in the changes if they're determined to be acceptable in the end, but it was a cold and rainy day here today so i was stuck inside ....

Here are the two i addressed today :
<A HREF="https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=5511">https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=5511</A> (I reported and fixed this)
<A HREF="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=322563">https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=322563</A> (i addressed part of it, i think the rest may already be addressed, but there is a slight imperfection with that part which i'm not sure how to fix just yet).

Tomorrow's weather doesn't look much better, but as of this moment i
    have nothing else that i'm working on, and i'm not going to start
    something new between now and bedtime.

-Rob

p.s. I know i don't need to contact the list with this stuff, but
    yesterday i sent six messages to the list, so if i didn't send at
    least one today (this one) i figured someone might think i died or
    something.
