<PRE>I work in a shop where our apps are written with C# and WinForms. &#160;Thank God for Mono; I'm allowed to do all my work under Linux with Mono, and my code works fine under MS Windows and .NET.

Recently, I ran into a showstopper bug in mono-winforms, and finally decided to look through the code. &#160;I fixed the bug quickly. &#160;That led me to looking for the source of other, non-showstopper bugs I've encountered, and those went quickly too. &#160;Enclosed is an archive with all of the bug fixes I made, which were made against the latest version on GitHub. &#160;(I originally made these bug fixes against version 2.10.5, the most recent one in Fedora Core 16's yum repos.)

Patch 1 implements the EditingControlShowing event in DataGridView. &#160;Before, it wasn't called at all. &#160;I had to split a DataGridViewCell.StyleEditingControl() method off of DataGridViewCell.InitializeEditingControl(); under .NET, ComboBox.Items is initialized before EditingControlShowing is posted, and this split was necessary to get Mono to work that way too. &#160;Styles modified in the EditingControlShowing event are now applied to text-box and checkbox controls too, not just combo-boxes.

Patch 2 resolves different behavior between .NET and Mono when the user leaves a DataGridView. &#160;Under .NET, the last-edited cell is committed; under Mono, changed made to the last-edited cell are lost. &#160;It was a one-line fix.

Patch 3 fires the DataGridView.SelectionChanged event when the selected rows/columns changes. &#160;Before, the values of the SelectedRows and SelectedColumns properties were semi-random during the SelectionChanged event; now they're accurate.

Patches 4 and 5 fix two different exception-throws I encountered when ComboBox.Items.Remove() is called with an item that's not in the combo box. &#160;.NET doesn't throw any exceptions in this case.

Patch 6 fixes the implementation of BackColor on ToolStripItem objects. &#160;Now it behaves like it does under .NET, i.e. the BackColor setting on menu items etc. shows up.

I would very much appreciate it if you would consider committing these changes. &#160;My MS-Windows-oriented co-workers were impressed by how quickly bugs in Mono can be found and fixed. &#160;Who knows, maybe I'll get some converts to open-source. &#160;(It amazes me that this sort of thing still has to be evangelized...sigh.)
