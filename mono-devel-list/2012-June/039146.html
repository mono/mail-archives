<PRE>OK, I can now run Mono under MS Windows. &#160;The last version of my test-project (attached again, for your convenience) now dies where it's supposed to in an unpatched Mono, i.e. it gets past 1-1.

I'm already checking with OS I'm on in this test. &#160;Apparently that wasn't enough. &#160;My guess is that I'm running into some other&#160;incompatibility&#160;between .NET and Mono, one way outside the scope of my bug fix. &#160;But the enclosed test-project checks both for MS Windows and for the absence of Mono before using the god-awful P/Invoke-based mouse click.

Rob: I'm trying to build latest Mono on MS Windows, and have applied the patch you posted yesterday. &#160;I'll let you (and everyone else) know how far I got. &#160;Hopefully I'll be able to run the enclosed test-project against it successfully &amp; FINALLY get this patch committed.

MY GOD, building Mono under MS Windows is slow. &#160;I don't realize how spoiled I am by Linux until times like this.

Steven Boswell

Subject: Re: [Mono-dev] Patches for mono-winforms
 
Hah. To run the application with Mono on Windows, you should use the Mono
command prompt, and run the application using the &quot;mono myapp.exe&quot; command.
The default window icon is different, which will confirm the application is
run with Mono.
For what it's worth, P/Invokes should work with Mono on Windows. So if you
have to use P/Invokes, maybe you shouldn't check with framework the
application is running on, but which OS you're on.

&quot;And re: getting bug fixes accepted, and WinForms not being a priority for
the Mono project...what about the bug fix for GetFileSystemEntries() I
posted a week ago?&#160; That's not WinForms, and I haven't heard a peep about
it.&quot;

I don't know. I'm not on the Mono team, and only deal with WinForms.
