<PRE>Ok, I've corrected the Whitespace issues...  You will only see the 
changes in pull request one of two because pull request 2 is on a 
different branch even though it contains some of the same commits.

I've also now labelled my pull requests in the sequence they are 
intended to come in..

I know my first three pull requests were pulled in by the infamous 
Miguel Di Icaza, whom i heard of years ago before i was even a mono 
user.  Not sure if i  need to wait for him to have free time to review 
these changes, and i understand he's busy so i'm not rushing anything.

My code was only tested on X11, is that an issue?  If so, i started a 
build on Win32 (With CygWin) and may be able to test on my Mac 
afterwards too.  I'm not sure about other platforms (what's a 'carbon').
