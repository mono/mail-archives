<PRE>Hi Nishant,

Yes, the end goal is to remove the Mono-specific FileStream, and replace it with the one in corefx. We wouldn't use a nuget package, but would take it directly from the sources of corefx: we have corefx as a git submodule in mono, so we can cherry-pick any source file we need/want, and compile them as part of our build process.

The initial MonoIO purpose was to have a abstraction layer that is usable from managed, and that can be used from FileStream, or anything else that needs it. The managed (C#) methods are very close to the Win32 API, which we have to emulate in the runtime on Unix systems. It serves a very specific purpose, but we would like to replace it with how it is done in corefx (not meaning that we want to modify it, but more that we want to get rid of it)

Mono does have a fork of corefx (<A HREF="https://github.com/mono/corefx">https://github.com/mono/corefx</A>), but we try to keep it as close as possible from upstream by regularly upstreaming what we can, and downstreaming every week or two. I am currently working on trying to integrate mono more to upstream corefx, so it's easier for both projects to evolve side by side.

I am on the IRC channel now, so if you want to ask any question feel free to ask them there, but I like email too, because the information I give you is accessible more broadly and is more persistent.

Thank you,
Ludovic

@Ludovic - is there any specific time that you hang out on one of the mIRC channels, i would love to talk to you there for sometime to ask all my questions at once.

Thanks,

Hi Ludovic,

Thanks for your reply. So is my understanding correct that the end aim is to remove the Mono-specific FileStream type and replace it with the FileStream class defined in CoreFx (perhaps imported via a nuget package reference) ?

What is the purpose of MonoIO ? And is there an equivalent in CoreFX?

Does mono use a fork of the CoreFX code? Or is it imported directly via nuget?

I think I want to go ahead with the FileStream project and would like to come up with a detailed plan of action that I can put in my proposal.

Thanks,
Rohit

Hi Nishant,

Our current implementation of System.IO.FileStream lives at <A HREF="https://github.com/mono/mono/blob/master/mcs/class/corlib/System.IO/FileStream.cs.">https://github.com/mono/mono/blob/master/mcs/class/corlib/System.IO/FileStream.cs.</A> It has strong dependencies on System.IO.MonoIO which lives at <A HREF="https://github.com/mono/mono/blob/master/mcs/class/corlib/System.IO/MonoIO.cs">https://github.com/mono/mono/blob/master/mcs/class/corlib/System.IO/MonoIO.cs</A> and which depends on the runtime for the different icalls implemented in <A HREF="https://github.com/mono/mono/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=filename%3Aw32file&amp;type=Code&lt;https://github.com/mono/mono/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=filename:w32file&amp;type=Code">https://github.com/mono/mono/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=filename%3Aw32file&amp;type=Code&lt;https://github.com/mono/mono/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=filename:w32file&amp;type=Code</A>&gt;.

Out current implementation of System.Diagnostics.Process lives at <A HREF="https://github.com/mono/mono/blob/master/mcs/class/System/System.Diagnostics/Process.cs.">https://github.com/mono/mono/blob/master/mcs/class/System/System.Diagnostics/Process.cs.</A> The runtime implements the different icalls in <A HREF="https://github.com/mono/mono/search?p=1&amp;q=filename%3Aw32process&amp;type=Code&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93&lt;https://github.com/mono/mono/search?p=1&amp;q=filename:w32process&amp;type=Code&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93">https://github.com/mono/mono/search?p=1&amp;q=filename%3Aw32process&amp;type=Code&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93&lt;https://github.com/mono/mono/search?p=1&amp;q=filename:w32process&amp;type=Code&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93</A>&gt;.

The end goal is to get rid of most of our mono-specific code both in managed and in the runtime (System.IO.MonoIO, the w32process and the w32file files), but we would first need to add support to CoreFX for the different platforms that we support that they don't (Android, iOS, Haiku, etc.)

I would be the one to look over these 2 projects, so if you have any question, I would be very happy to answer them.

Thank you,
Ludovic

Hi,

Any guidance here would be appreciated!

Hi,
I am a grad student in India and I came across this board from the GSoC idea page for Mono. I would love to help in the Microsoft .NET and Mono integration initiative, as I have plenty of experience in C# and .NET Framework/.NET Core along with other tools like NuGet. Please let me know of a good way to get started!

I was hoping to get in touch with Ludovic Henry and talk to him about a plan of action. The projects that catch my eye include:

1) Import System.IO.FileStream from CoreFx
2) Import Process from CoreFx

I have a few boiling questions that i would love if someone could help answer for me so I can start working on writing the proposal.

It would also be great, if to get familiar in this area, someone could point me to a few bugs which I can fix before GSoC to get my hands dirty.


Thanks,
Nishant
