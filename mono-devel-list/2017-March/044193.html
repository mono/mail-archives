<PRE>You made up a few assumption which are incorrect based on my understanding.

* WinForms run on Linux (Mono has an implementation, but it hasn't been
evolved or actively extend right now).
* GTK# was not created. GTK/GTK+ were there already, so Mono just wraps them
up with C# bindings, aka GTK#. It is a way to interop with native operating
system APIs. You can see Qt/Cocoa bindings too.

To know more about the history, you might visit a page I maintained
<A HREF="http://corefx.strikingly.com">http://corefx.strikingly.com</A>

Now to address your questions. 

1.- Don't ever try to compare .NET Framework/.NET Core/Mono in the hard way.
They have overlaps but relationship such as &quot;superset&quot; does not exist. They
each have a unique API surface.

1.1.- Mono supports more native API bindings and platforms at this stage
than .NET Core. When .NET Core grows to a large size, then one day you can
only use .NET Core. .NET Core is not a &quot;simple implementation&quot; at all. It is
the new (though not brand new) CLR implementation from Microsoft.

1.2.- What do you mean by &quot;new Mono&quot;? Like any migration, you need to assert
API surface used by your app and then fill the gaps manually. Some is easy
while others are hard. Try it.

1.3.- What do you mean by &quot;without adapt the source code&quot;? I don't think you
will get Java style compile once run anywhere yet.

1.4.- Xamarin apps run on mobile OSs (or macOS). Their relationship with
.NET Core right now is that .NET Standard libraries can be consumed by
Xamarin projects. No more imagination please.

2.

2.1.- What are the &quot;2 platforms&quot; you refer to? If you mean Mono and .NET
Core, then all efforts right now are focused on .NET Core at least at
Microsoft side. Mono plans to adopt .NET Core bits (instead of open source
.NET Framework source files) but in most cases just for compatibility
purposes. All developers should use .NET Core if possible, and fall back to
Mono if you really have to (IMHO).

2.2.- Again, try. No real answer could be given to this.
