I don’t think that there is much to be done about this at the Mono run time level.

The thunking API is certainly simpler given that you just have to provide MonoObject *.

You could likely provide some helper functions that could query an exclusively  MonoObject * argument list and unbox reference types on the fly.

</I>
Which language are you calling into the embedded API from?

In my own case my wrappers are produced a code generator which understands how to generate argument lists both for property thunking and for method invocation using mono_runtime_invoke.
