</I>&gt;<i> number gets used up quickly. Obviously the right thing to do would be to 
</I>&gt;<i> make sure mod-mono-server doesn't hang when it runs out of worker 
</I>&gt;<i> threads (if this was even the problem), but barring a fix there, this 
</I>&gt;<i> did the job.
</I>It would be a good thing to make sure that the thread pool exhaustion was
causing the problem, but even without doing it - I think such rate limiting is
a good thing to have.
 
&gt;<i> In my case, I was having problems when the number of concurrent requests 
</I>&gt;<i> went above 20 or 25. (I forget the details. I've been using this patch 
</I>&gt;<i> for around 3-4 months... modulo changes I made today.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The patch by default limits the number of concurrent requests passed to 
</I>&gt;<i> mod-mono-server to 20. After that, it holds onto (by default) up to 20 
</I>&gt;<i> more, checking periodically until the initial 20 decreases or a timeout 
</I>&gt;<i> (hard-coded at 10 seconds). The two 20's are configurable with 
</I>&gt;<i> MonoMaxActiveRequests and MonoMaxWaitingRequests.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This will only work on Apache2 since it relies on the shared memory 
</I>&gt;<i> dashboards.
</I>Great stuff :) - please commit, thanks!

best regards,

marek
