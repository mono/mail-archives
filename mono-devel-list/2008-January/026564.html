Reportedly you can run recent versions of a Win32 Mono build under
recent versions of Wine, so theoretically all you'd need to do is
install the Win32 Mono under Wine and run your app with the Win32 Mono.

The downside to this is that you're using the Win32 Mono, and thus can't
use any Unix-specific functionality (such as Mono.Unix.Native.Syscall).

The Winelib-based glue the wiki suggests would also work, but would also
be more difficult.  One of the earlier Mono System.Windows.Forms efforts
was built upon Winelib, and it was very problematic getting Mono and
Winelib to interact properly (but I don't recall the specific details).
