This patch has been committed.

For future reference, this patch would not have been enough in
isolation, as MonoPosixHelper would not know about the values you just
added (and thus would generate an error when given these values instead
of translating them appropriately).

So in addition to the Mono.Posix patch, you also need to patch
mono/support.  This is (usually) fairly straightforward:

	cd mono/support
	make refresh

The downside is that `make refresh` depends upon create-native-map,
which is in mono-tools, so you'd have to build &amp; install mono-tools
first before you could refresh mono/support to get the new values you
added to Mono.Unix.Native.MountFlags.
