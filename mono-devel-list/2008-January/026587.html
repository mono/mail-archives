Agreed.  Options.Parse() should return either a List&lt;string&gt; or a
string[] (probably the latter).  I suspected this was a bad idea when
all of the unit tests needed an extra .ToArray() at the end...

&gt;<i> A better approach, I think, would be have a Parse() method that parses

</I>&gt;<i> parameter.  I like using an out parameter because it signals that
</I>&gt;<i> Parse() is doing more than just producing an array.  
</I>
I don't see how an out parameter would be better than a return value,
especially considering that every other .Parse() method in the framework
actually returns a value.

However, a `bool TryParse(string[] args, out string[] result)' might be
useful if the use of exceptions is undesirable.  (However, w/o
exceptions how would the user know what the problem was?)  I'm less sure
about this idea.

&gt;<i> Another thing I think is really important is better error handling for
</I>&gt;<i> typed options.  If the call to TypeConverter.ConvertFromString()
</I>&gt;<i> fails, the exception thrown needs to identify the name of the option
</I>&gt;<i> that failed as well as its value.  I would create a specific exception
</I>&gt;<i> class to convey this (with the original exception inside) so that the
</I>&gt;<i> case can be caught and handled separately in the user's code.
</I>
Throwing something other than InvalidOperationException would probably
be good, so that the offending option can be more easily identified.

Thank you for the suggestions.
