Attached is an updated patch set which supports both the existing/new
Stdlib.signal() semantics (as the previous patch set did) in which the
signal handler is invoked on an internal helper thread, and adds a new
Mono.Unix.UnixSignal type to permit polling and/or blocking as lupus
originally suggested.

The one thing I don't like (but can't think of a workaround) is the
interaction between UnixSignal and Stdlib.signal(): as currently
implemented, UnixSignal and Stdlib.signal() can't handle the same signal
simultaneously -- if UnixSignal registered to handle e.g. SIGINT, then
Stdlib.signal() will return SIG_ERR, with errno set to EEXIST.

However, the alternate IS possible: UnixSignal can handle e.g. SIGINT if
Stdlib.signal() was previously called to handle it (and will
consequently replace the original Stdlib.signal() handler).  The
&quot;original&quot; Stdlib.signal() handler will be replaced when the UnixSignal
instance is destroyed.

(One workaround I can think of would be for Stdlib.signal() and
UnixSignal to use the same data structures, but I want to keep the
registered_signals array as short as possible to keep down the signal
handler execution time.  Plus one concern: what *should* happen if one
thread creates a UnixSignal instance for SIGINT, then calls
UnixSignal.WaitOne(), then another thread calls
Stdlib.signal(SIGINT,SIG_IGN) while WaitOne() is blocking?

Of course, this could be used as an argument to dump Stdlib.signal()
support entirely, but it needs to stick around to permit setting SIG_IGN
on a given signal.  I suppose Stdlib.signal() could be restricted to
just accepting SIG_IGN, SIG_ERR, and SIG_DFL and error out if any other
delegate instance is passed, so that people use UnixSignal for all
significant signal usage, but I don't like this either as currently each
UnixSignal.WaitOne() call requires a separate pipe, while
Stdlib.signal() uses a single pipe multiplexed across all registered
signals...)

Thoughts?
