<PRE>Hello,

    I do not speak for Linden, you should direct these questions at
them,   but here are some guesses:

&gt;<i> May I ask questions about Mono in Second Life as below?
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Which language will residents input for script after Mono is
</I>&gt;<i> applied ?
</I>
LSL.

&gt;<i> 2. I know LSL still works. But can it still be inputted as a supported
</I>&gt;<i> language? 
</I>
Yes, your LSL code now gets JITed using Mono instead of being
intepreted.

&gt;<i> 3. Do residents have to download software for Mono ? Or just input the
</I>&gt;<i> language Mono supports as simple as what LSL does currently.
</I>
They can keep doing it in the same way;   My understanding is that you
only need to check a checkbox in the SecondLife viewer, and your LSL
script will be executed with Mono instead of the current LSL engine.

&gt;<i> 4. Is the language Mono supports more difficult than LSL and thereby
</I>&gt;<i> most of residents can't work well on it? 
</I>
Currently only LSL is supported;   I believe they plan on opening up
SecondLife to new languages in the future.

&gt;<i> 5, May I understand the language is still LSL for residents, but the
</I>&gt;<i> virtual-machine changes into Mono ?
</I>
Its an internal change that offers more speed for now;   More features
will be available in the future.

</PRE>
