<PRE>I was wondering if anyone knows of any companies that offers mono
development consulting/support. We tried novell but found out they no
longer are offering support for mono and will be taking that off the
website and was told to look in the open source community for support so
Im not sure , does anyone know of any company that offers commercial
support for mono given that we have a lot off issues and work we would
need to get done with mono and don't have the time to get someone
internally up to speed to work on that for now. As an aside the other
thing that is confusing is what novells financial interest in mono is if
they dont offer commercial support considering novell supplies a large
portion of the contribution to this open source project.

 

 

thanks
