We can't arbitrarily add gurantees: only things defined in the pthread
and posix standards are allowed in a signal context, we can handwave as
much as you want, but those are the limitations.
And I didn't say you can't use signals in a mono app, you can (by using C
signal handlers).

&gt;<i> The alternative -- requiring that all signal handlers be written in C --

</I>&gt;<i> Beagle, etc) have a C library to properly handle session ending (SIGTERM

No, it would simply require that Mono.Posix provide a sane interface
instead of the current broken one. I'll propose one below.

&gt;<i> So why can't setting a volatile variable within a signal handler be
</I>&gt;<i> supported?  And/or use a Constrained Execution Region to *ensure* that
</I>&gt;<i> the signal handler is JITed before the signal is emitted (does mono even

</I>
The issue is not in the setting of a volatile variable, it is in the
need to execute managed code. CERs have no relevance to this issue.
As you may not be familiar with the details, I'll explain them.
Installing a C# signal handler means creating a delegate and then
marshaling it to unmanaged code as a function pointer. The function
pointer then enters managed code and executes the delegate.

The first problem is that all this code needs to be already compiled to
native code as running the jit in the signal handler breaks all the
signal context limitations. In particular this means that both the
target method and the delegate Invoke function itself are already
compiled. In addition to this, any runtime service that they may use
must be signal context safe. At the minimum this requires that the same
delegate object instance that is marshaled is actually executed
(as this involves a number of delegate invoke optimizazions in the
runtime that we won't make signal context safe as it doesn't make
sense). After this of course the delegate method itself must be
very simple. I'll ignore multicast delegate issues.

Once you start to realize all these restrictions you know that
there is no way that you can make sure that any average C# programmer
follows half of them. The existing Mono.Posix signal interface just
tricks people into thinking that they can do this safely, while they
can't.

But let's assume that all the above is doable (and making a runtime
guarantee that it is would also mean that the runtime will be severily
constrained in the changes it can do for a lot of implementation details
that actually matter for performance like delegate invocation).
The next thing to consider is the code that the callback needs to
execute. The first thing it does is to ensure the application domain
for the thread where the signal handler executes actually matches the
appdomain the delegate comes from, if it isn't it may need to set it and
do several things that we can't guarantee are signal context safe
(like the recently discussed deserialization of the culture info).
If the delegate is of an instance method we also need to retrieve
the object reference, which may require taking locks (for a non-moving
collector we'll need a handle as we can't embed the object address in
the native code stream).

Given the above, there is basically no chance that anyone could
correctly install a signal handler and if it was possible it would
constrain and likely slow down many parts of the mono runtime.

All of this can be easily overcome with a sane interface for signals
provided by Mono.Posix (the implementation can be in either the helper
lib or in the runtime).
This would export a class like (pseudo code):

	class UnixSignalHandler {
		IntPtr flag_var_ptr;

		pulic UnixSignalHandler (int signal) {
			flag_var_ptr = Install (signal);
			if (flag_var_ptr == null)
				throw new Exception ();
		}

		~UnixSignalHandler () {
			Uninstall (signal, flag_var_ptr);
		}

		public bool IsSignalled {
			get {
				if (*(int*)flag_var_ptr) {
					*(int*)flag_var_ptr = 0;
					return true;
				}
				return false;
			}
		}
	}

Install is implemented in C and will reserve a slot in an array for
storing a variable which is set in the actual signal handler
and return its pointer after calling signal().
The class should also implement the Dispose pattern, imho.
IsSignalled could be also made non-destructive.

This class can also be trivially extended with a Wait() method
(which is much more useful and allows a non-polling behaviour)
which can read from a pipe (the signal handler will write a byte to it)
or use sem_wait (the signal handler will sem_post on a semaphore:
this has more portability issues as the POS OSX doesn't allow easy
creation of semaphores). This would be enabled with a different
constructor (maybe it should be the default behaviour and we'd have a
separate ctor that takes a pollable bool).
With the pipe implementation multiple signals can be waited on
with a single call (using select on the C side) and timeouts can be used
as well.

This API implements what 99% of the users need from signal handlers
in a safe and portable way.
