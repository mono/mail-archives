<PRE>hmm, we talked to novell consulting and they pretty much said they dont
want do to anything related to giving mono support no
matter what money we offer them and I presume there currently isnt any
partner support so we would be left with trying to get support
through suse support. I presume they would give us mono support through
our suse support agreement?

Subject: Re: [Mono-dev] mono support

Hello,

&gt;<i> I was wondering if anyone knows of any companies that offers mono
</I>&gt;<i> development consulting/support. We tried novell but found out they no
</I>&gt;<i> longer are offering support for mono and will be taking that off the
</I>&gt;<i> website and was told to look in the open source community for support
</I>
We used to have a SKU for providing support, but when we had it, barely
anyone used it.   So it was discontinued.

You can gain support today as a SUSE customer, which reuses the existing
support organization.

Ideally though, we would like to have a network of partners that can
provide support for developers and that have a relationship with our
engineering team to be able to escalate L3 issues to us.

&gt;<i>  As an aside the other thing that is confusing is what novells
</I>&gt;<i> financial interest in mono is if they dont offer commercial support
</I>&gt;<i> considering novell supplies a large portion of the contribution to
</I>&gt;<i> this open source project.
</I>
The logistics to provide direct tech support are too complicated.  You
can still get support if you engage for example the consulting
organization of Novell, but it comes with a relatively high price tag.
