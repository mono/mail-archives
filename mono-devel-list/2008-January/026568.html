Fair point.

</I>
Now what do you mean by &quot;non-standard,&quot; i.e. what's the &quot;standard&quot;
here?  .NET?  Windows has no signals, so .NET won't expose such a
concept.

On the other hand, the Mono.Unix.Native types have existed for quite
some time and intend to follow the Standard C and POSIX interfaces as
closely as possible.  signal(2) is part of the C standard, and is thus
exposed via Stdlib.signal().  It's as standard as you're going to get.

&gt;<i> Note that polling a variable is a fine way to handle signals in many C

</I>&gt;<i> where want_to_die is set by my SIGTERM/SIGINT/etc handler.  Involving

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This reminds me, though: what happens to things like socket

</I>&gt;<i> they get interrupted and return EINTR/EAGAIN, which is why you pop
</I>&gt;<i> back to the mainloop and get a chance to poll your signal variable.
</I>
The same thing would happen if you use the low-level Syscall methods --
-1 would be returned and Stdlib.GetLastError() would return Errno.EINTR
or Errno.EAGAIN.  The higher-level Mono.Unix types like UnixStream
ignore EINTR.

However, this does raise an interesting problem with a thread-based
approach: since signal dispatching would happen on another thread, there
is no guarantee (and no way to guarantee) that the signal will be
dispatched before the system call returns:

        1. Thread 1: Syscall.write()
        2. kernel dispatches signal to process
        3. Thread 1: Syscall.write() returns -1/EINTR
        # some future point in time...
        4. Thread 2: Dispatches signal originally raised in (2).

Thread 1 can't safely check e.g. a variable after the EINTR return (in
the normal C fashion) because it might not have been set by the signal
handler yet.  It would instead need to wait on a semaphore/condition
variable, which the signal handler could set, to ensure that the threads
are properly synchronized.

On the plus side, the signal handler thread can actually use
semaphores/etc. as it's not running within signal handler context.

So perhaps it would make more sense to expose lupus' approach and layer
Stdlib.signal() atop of it.  Though to do that we'd need a better name:
there is already a Mono.Unix.Native.SignalHandler type, and trying to
describe the difference between SignalHandler and UnixSignalHandler is
something I don't look forward to.  Perhaps instead:

        public class Signal  : System.Threading.WaitHandle {
                public Signal (Signum signal);
                ~Signal ();
                public Signum Signum { get; }
                public bool IsSignaled { get; set; }
        }

though the WaitHandle base type might be pure crack (not sure);
regardless, IDisposable should certainly be implemented.
