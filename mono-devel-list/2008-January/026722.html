<PRE>  Ximian, the company that used to sponser Mono, and still does after being swallowed by Novell, used to sell a product called I think, &quot;Ximian Connector,&quot; which was also aquired by Novell.
   
  The product allowed, I think, Linux clients to connect to Exchange servers.
  I don't know what it cost, or if it is even still supported by Novell.

Hi,

I am in the unfortunate position of having to run Windows because my company
uses exchange and will not open IMAP or POP so I can read mail from
Thunderbird. So I run VMWare on Windows with an OpenSuse VM. I run CygWin
and use SSH to forward the display back to Windows/Cygwin. It works amazing
well as long as I close things regularly, because there are some memory
leaks somewhere.
