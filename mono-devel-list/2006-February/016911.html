mono_method_verify () has been superseded by verification during
JIT time. The latter is more correct and complete, though a few
checks are still missing.

There are several rules to enforce, we haven't yet scheduled a
full audit to make all the checks and make sure they are correct.

Mono development is driven by user needs and user contributions,
so contributing fixes and features is the best way to get something
done. We'll help with advice, code reviews, and actual code, since
full verification is one of our mid/long term goals anyway. Plus
it helps to know that some people actually need the feature.
I suggest starting with a comprehensive list of test cases that we
can use as a test suite for the verification process.

&gt;<i> open CLI assembly verifiers I could use instead?
</I>
There is no complete and tested verifier, so your best bet is to
help us improve the mono one. Also note that a verifier is not enough
to ensure secure execution: you need also the CAS runtime support
that Sebastien has been working on (activated with the --security switch).
