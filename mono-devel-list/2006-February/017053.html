The website updates are scripted.  I'll need to update these anyway, so
I'll add a feature of &quot;latest version&quot; for these older distros.

I believe it boils down to that I can't compile gnome-sharp2 because it
depends on libpanelapplet, which isn't available on win32.  Without
gnome-sharp2, I can't compile gtkhtml-sharp2, which I'm able to do with
1.0.10, because 1.0.10's gnome-sharp doesn't require libpanelapplet.

Now, if I could use gecko-sharp on win32 (which I haven't figured out
how to do this yet), then yes, the only missing piece would be
gconf-sharp2.
