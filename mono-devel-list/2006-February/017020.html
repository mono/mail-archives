<PRE>Gert, thanks for a great copyright infringement. It'd be even nicer
if you didn't omit the entire first mail that you sent me.

For my private favor (such as &quot;Yes, I prefer POX much over SOAP&quot; and
&quot;Yes I'm not a fan of already-failed compatiblity by Microsoft itself&quot;),
I'll reply to you privately.

Many tests were someone else's bad, so I thought it's not something
you should fix. However the reason of the failure largely looked
identical so I thought that it'd be best to ask you to take care of
them.

If you don't think it is no problem, then I don't understand why
you didn't CC to the list from the first stage. If I were you,
I wouldn't have done that in the same message. That is what I
said &quot;bad&quot;.

You can start marking bad lines in my messages but legally
you cannot make it public. It is even non-publicated authority,
and you didn't absolutely do it &quot;by mistake&quot;.

Atsushi Eno
