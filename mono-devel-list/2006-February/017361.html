I would, except that list appears to be a ghost town. I'll check with them as 
soon as my subscription clears, though.

There's a fundamental problem here: Any documentation you could write for the 
base classes must necessarily be a derivative work of the original ECMA 
documentation. I think trying to avoid copyright infringement here will be 
difficult at best.

I've written to the ECMA to ask what the rules are on licensing the contents of 
their standards. It might be better, though, if either a Novell employee or a 
Swiss native would give them a call.
