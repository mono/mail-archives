<PRE>It depends a lot on what you want to do, but why not just use C#? It can
compile at runtime and interact with your existing code no problem. I've
done this before in MS .NET 1.1 and 2.0, and I'd assume it works in mono as
well. This article is a good place to get an idea of what you're getting
into: <A HREF="http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/RuntimeCompiling.asp">http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/RuntimeCompiling.asp</A> 

The main advantage of using this method is that if it makes sense for you,
it's really easy to do. I've seen it used to make plugin interfaces before
which sounds like it's along the lines of what you want.
Thanks,

Subject: [Mono-dev] Mono embedded scripting language advice

Hi.
I have an app in which I have a small 'console' text area in which I'd 
like to have users enter small snippet of code in a scripting language, 
that I can then execute.  I'd also like to define some 'functions' 
up-front that will access my app's (C#) classes.

Can someone recommend an implementation of a scripting language that is 
known to work with Mono? (and is stable)
I tried boo, but the latest version crashes on 'print &quot;hello world&quot;' 
with the latest release (and svn) versions of mono
(on FedoraCore 4).
Next I tried IronPython Beta 3 - which crashes on startup with a 'not 
implemented' exception.
The Mono JavaScript page says it is under heavy development and one of 
the future plans is &quot;Access to Mono's base class library&quot;.

What other options are there that are known to work reliably? 
(I don't know VB, but I understand it is not really a scripting 
language, right?).

Thanks,
-David.
