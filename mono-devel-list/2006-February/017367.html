<PRE> 
Thanks Jacek!  For now I have decided that DateTime.UtcNow is good enough
for my purposes, and I have created an implementation of
System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch using System.DateTime as the underlying counter
mechanism.  I have attached the code, if anyone is interested or if you want
to include it Mono (I'm not familiar with the process to formally submit
code for Mono), since Mono does not currently have an implementation of this
class.

Jonathan

Subject: RE: [Mono-dev] high-resolution timer in Mono?

Hello!

QueryPerformanceCounter() does not provide that high resolution either (only
on 2 or more processor machines resolution is exactly 1 processor tick +/-
call cycles) otherwise its the very same as for DateTime.UtcNow (but not
DateTime.Now - which takes some extra overhead) for details check blogs on
MSDN.  

Please check the link below for project NGmp on sourceforge.net (it's CIL
binding for GMP and MPFR multiprecision numeric libraries) - first files
will be released later today -  for some utility code which will help you on
both Unix/Linux and Windows x86 platforms with very pecise time measurments.
Method GetProcessorTicks() in class Utilities implemements P/Invoke wrapper
for call to native rdtsc x86 instruction which allows for reading internal
x86 processor cycle counter thus providing the ultimate timer resolution
which can be thought of. The measurment overhead is roughly 100 processor
cycles on .NET after compiling assembly with ngen (Mono --aot option does
not work with my code due to some bugs which I am going to file to bugzilla
today).

Not that I know of, but anyone wanting to develop one would want to
implement the new System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch class from .NET 2.0. It was
designed to wrap/replace QueryPerformanceCounter(). I guess a lot of people
wanted that.
