Welcome aboard!

&gt;<i> I have set up a bugzilla account and joined the mailing list. I plan
</I>&gt;<i> do download the source this weekend and try to start hacking away at
</I>&gt;<i> some bug fixes. Before doing so I had a couple of questions:
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 1. When I fix a bug, how do I submit the bug fix?
</I>
a. If the bug is filled in bugzilla then you should attach a patch
(diff) to that bug entry. You can also change the bug summary to start
with &quot;[PATCH]&quot; so it will get more visibility (to be reviewed).

If the bug isn't filled into bugzilla, then you should first fill the
bug, then attach the patch.

If you're unsure if it's a bug or not, then you can ask on this mailing
list.

&gt;<i>  Do I commit it directly to source control (SVN)? 
</I>
No, you can't (at least not right now). Read
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Contributing">http://www.mono-project.com/Contributing</A>
for more details.

&gt;<i> Or is there a procedure to follow?
</I>
There is a lot of useful information on the wiki
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/">http://www.mono-project.com/</A>

You can also search the mailing-list archive for more information.

&gt;<i> 2. What should I include with bug fix? (Regression Test? Sample App?
</I>&gt;<i> Ect?)\
</I>
When possible (which should be near 98% of the cases) please add one (or
more) unit test(s) that will be added to our test suite (to avoid future
regressions).

&gt;<i> 3. Is the any place I should introduce myself? (Mailing list ??)
</I>
Mono-devel-list is the right place (and you already did introduce
yourself ;-)

Note that the mono-bugs mailing list is only meant to receive the
changes in bugzilla. You shouldn't send email to that list.

Cheers!
