<PRE>Hey Zoltan,

Not sure if you were answering me or, more probably, the complete
thread, anyway...

I think there are other issues to consider (like code duplication,
reuse, total time...) but personally I don't mind either solution.

</I>
Can this be re-phrased as &quot;can't have maximum performance with all
security checks&quot; ? as I believe we *could* have a fast (but not as fast
as it could be) JIT with all checks - just like MS has (at least if we
had the same resources ;-).

&gt;<i> 'We are missing some checks' is a far cry from security.
</I>
Can't disagree with that. In fact 'We have all the checks' is still a
far cry from security ;-)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Zoltan suggested that we should implement a proper verifier, but if the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; right way of doing verification is by sending the method to the JIT,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; then we should go down the path I proposed (email pasted at the end).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I second this. It would be very very useful for us if mono wouldn't g_assert

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I believe it would be useful to many people - even if most don't realize

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IMHO, &quot;limits&quot; it usefulness (I admit the &quot;limit&quot; is probably rather low
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as there are very few applications supporting partial trust today).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anyway the truth (please feel all free to prove me wrong ;-) is that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; security, especially runtime security, hasn't been very popular with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contributors - in any form (e.g. code, samples, reviews, test cases...).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I may be biased but I'm glad that Novell is investing in this (ok I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; totally biased ;-). However Mono could use a little more global support
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and/or contributions in this domain. I guess we could see this as either
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a participation or a patience game ;-)
