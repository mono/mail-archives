Sounds good.
Would you mind extracting the IL template source in their own files?
Maybe something called testtype.iltmpl.
This way it's easier to look at them.

Note that at least some templetes are invalid:
in make_bin_test.sh the signature of Main() is parametrized, but this is
not allowed, since only no args or string[] is accepted.

</I>
The attached Makefile is what I temporarily use, it doesn't count
that all the cil files have been compiled and that we really threw the
exception (need a cmdline option for that).
Or, another option that would make testing much faster:
instead of having independent il programs, make them compile
to a library and generate a C# driver program that calls each function
with a try {} catch (ExpectedException) {} clause. This can't be done
for all the tests, though ...
