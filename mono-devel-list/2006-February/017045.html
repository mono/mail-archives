As a sanity check, you should make sure your DriveInfo members reflect
the final .NET 2.0 DriveInfo members.  I wrote UnixDriveInfo during one
of the .NET 2.0 betas, so it's entirely possible that they added/changed
the members.

If I knew of one, I'd have used it. :-)

I'd love to know an answer to this one.  This information might be
available via some ioctl(2) call, and if that's true you'll have more
trouble than me, since you'll need to add the appropriate Win32 calls to
I/O layer and use an internal call, since mscorlib.dll can't depend on
Mono.Posix.dll...

HAL?  Alas, that isn't POSIX; it's only used by Gnome afaik.

This is another area that doesn't seem to be well supported by POSIX.
