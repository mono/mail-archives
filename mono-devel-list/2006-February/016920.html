I believe it would be useful to many people - even if most don't realize
it today. Until then Mono is &quot;restricted&quot; to run trusted code which,
IMHO, &quot;limits&quot; it usefulness (I admit the &quot;limit&quot; is probably rather low
as there are very few applications supporting partial trust today).

Anyway the truth (please feel all free to prove me wrong ;-) is that
security, especially runtime security, hasn't been very popular with
contributors - in any form (e.g. code, samples, reviews, test cases...).

I may be biased but I'm glad that Novell is investing in this (ok I'm
totally biased ;-). However Mono could use a little more global support
and/or contributions in this domain. I guess we could see this as either
a participation or a patience game ;-)
