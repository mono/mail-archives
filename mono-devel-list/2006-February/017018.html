I'll take it to the list them, fine by me. More comments inline.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Can you have a look at the attached patch ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; No, I don't think the patch is ready for others' review. Too big as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; compared to the practical purpose, and should be split into several
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; small patches.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ok, I'll try to do that. But again, one of the reasons why 
</I>&gt;<i> the patch is so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; big is because I added numerous test cases for the changes I made.
</I>
Care to comment on this ?

&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Lluis have applied some patches such as from Kosta,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I know, and my patch even includes tests for the bug fixes 
</I>&gt;<i> by Kosta's patch (which did not include tests at all).
</I>
Same here ?

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and fixed remoting bugs those days. I don't think the reason your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; patch is not applied is because he is extra-busy.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If I'm only limited to supplying one-line fixes, then it's 
</I>&gt;<i> just not possible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to fix any serious bugs. You must understand that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think your comment here is linked to whatever I have written.
</I>
Perhaps not, but you're referring to other patches that you think are more
likely to get committed.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I'm also pretty unaware about XmlSerialization code. I even had
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; no clue to fix some bugs reported to bugzilla, which is practical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and not just for minor compatibility stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The bugs that are fixed by my patches are definitely not just for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compatibility !
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As long as I read the patch, the only significant but totally minor
</I>&gt;<i> fix is to handle &quot;name-escaped&quot; items. And it could be made in
</I>&gt;<i> smaller patch.
</I>
I'm sure I can split up my patch in 10 different bug reports (one of which
is #77500), each showing a significant bug.

&gt;<i> &gt; Also, you explicitly asked me to look into the test 
</I>&gt;<i> failures on .NET 2.0. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; looked into it, and fixed a few Mono test failures. 
</I>&gt;<i> Ofcourse, it's not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; always possible to fix a bug with a one-line change.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I asked you as a System.Xml hacker was to *fix* test failures
</I>&gt;<i> at least whatever you have added, which had been messing NUnit
</I>&gt;<i> tests. It was rather like asking &quot;please fix the build that you
</I>&gt;<i> broke&quot;, not something else.
</I>
I know I &quot;broke&quot; the unit tests on .NET 2.0 (and only there). That's why I
asked for you opinion on this (through the mono-devel mailing list).

&gt;<i> Thus I said I'd appreciate if you would
</I>&gt;<i> also take care of others as well. If you don't want, I wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> ask you to touch extra broken stuff.
</I>
Not sure I understand what you're saying here, sorry language barrier I
guess.

I definitely want to fix the other issues too. I just don't want to spend a
large amount of time on fixes that will not get committed, that's all. 

Again, I'm not trying to offend you or anyone else here: I just want to know
if I should quit trying to get fixes in svn.

&gt;<i> I erased a bunch of lines in the first draft to the reply to you.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm largely copying it from there. I'd recommend you not to read
</I>&gt;<i> more.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First of all, you should ask Lluis to have a look at your patch.
</I>&gt;<i> Asking others to have a look at the patch without telling the
</I>&gt;<i> maintainer is highly discouraged. If I were to review the patch,
</I>&gt;<i> it would have ended up to have Lluis review the patch again,
</I>&gt;<i> which is totally duplicate task.
</I>
Make sense. Point taken.

&gt;<i> Asking anyone other than the maintainer to review the patch
</I>&gt;<i> privately is highly discouraged. You could always do that in
</I>&gt;<i> mono-devel-list.
</I>
I did, I just asked you if it would be possible to review the patch so I'd
know whether I can continue in the direction or not.

I asked this because I have a few days off, and I wanted to know up front if
I should bother continue working on fixing the XML serialization issues.

&gt;<i> I really don't understand why you keep sending private messages
</I>&gt;<i> like this. It rather looks like that you always write something
</I>&gt;<i> that you cannot write publicly, or you think that it is OK to
</I>&gt;<i> say anything bad to me privately, which is wrong.
</I>
I'll copy my email to you here:

========================

Hi Atsushi,

Can you have a look at the attached patch ?

I've asked Lluis to review it too, but I guess he's very busy (well, you
probably too but you can't blame a guy for trying LOL).

I'd like to continue fixing issues in System.Xml.Serialization, but I've
quite a lot of changes queued locally (apart from this patch) that still
need approval, and it's getting unmanagable. I have a few days off, and I'd
like to make good use of these days (for mono).

If you have no time, no problem.

Gert

========================

Please explain: which line in this email is BAD ?

Should I start marking the &quot;BAD&quot; lines in your email for fun ?

&gt;<i> My private favor is that MS XML Serialization design is HYPE.
</I>&gt;<i> It does not even handle usual structures such as choices of
</I>&gt;<i> sequences (I even blogged about that for years).
</I>
Then you're saying web services are HYPE too, because they rely on XML
serialization ?

&gt;<i> Also, since MS XmlSerializer implementation had improved much
</I>&gt;<i> in .NET 2.0, compatibility is anyways broken and it is to silly
</I>&gt;<i> to mind it.
</I>
So you're saying that we should not even attempt to be compatible with .NET
2.0 ?

&gt;<i> Thus I dislike silly compatibility fixes, especially
</I>&gt;<i> when someone asked to handle numeric values as a valid
</I>&gt;<i> enumeration values (since it becomes always invalid).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One of the reason why I respect Lluis is because he takes care
</I>&gt;<i> of the worst components in System.Xml. XML Schema sucks as well,
</I>&gt;<i> but I maintain it because there is no other hacker that can
</I>&gt;<i> handle it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let me summarize my private favor: I totally don't care about
</I>&gt;<i> XML serialization stuff, except for test failures.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My best advice is to ask best proper person, Lluis, to review
</I>&gt;<i> your patch when it got ready. He is a graceful hacker to take
</I>&gt;<i> care of such mostly-for-compatibility patches.
</I>
I have no doubt on that!

Gert
