We followed the same practices as are observed in the mono source code. 

We use Visual Studio 2005 as a development environment.  We can target 
different versions of mono and also different versions of the .NET 
framework.  Attached is the latest version of the targets file that we 
use. 

If you search the archives of this list I have posted previously 
instructions on how to use it.
