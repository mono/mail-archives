<PRE>    Hello Aaron,

    I'll reply your message inline :

&gt;<i> Hello everyone.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;offtopic ramble=&quot;always&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm bombing you mailing list with this request because I am a nasty little 
</I>&gt;<i> Win32 programmer who knows virtually nothing about Linux. I'd like to get 
</I>&gt;<i> the Open Source project I'm working on to run under Linux, so I thought 
</I>&gt;<i> maybe you guys could help.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To be straight up and down from the outset: at this point I'm not 
</I>&gt;<i> interested in installing and learning about Linux. I've seen some stuff 
</I>&gt;<i> come and go in my time and although I know Linux is here to stay, I just 
</I>&gt;<i> don't have the time and energy to invest in learning a whole heap of new 
</I>&gt;<i> technologies - I do it at work and I do it for my project, that is enough! 
</I>&gt;<i> I need to gain enough information to get my project to work under Linux for 
</I>&gt;<i> the people who want it, nothing more. Learning Linux is on my list of 
</I>&gt;<i> Things To Do, just not near the top. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK so now you know a bit about me and where I'm coming from. I'm writing an 
</I>&gt;<i> audio application on SourceForge called VioLet Composer, and some people 
</I>&gt;<i> would like to see it working under Linux. OK, so here's what I know (it 
</I>&gt;<i> isn't much)...
</I>
    
    I took a look on your project and it looks cool. Congratulations for
the effort of porting to Mono.


&gt;<i> 1) The guts of my program, written in C# using basic Windows Forms, should 
</I>&gt;<i> work OK if someone were to convert it to a Mono project.
</I>

    Windows Forms 1.1 compatibility should be ok, and 2.0 is under
development, so stick to 1.1 and you will save a lot of headache.


&gt;<i> 2) My audio routines, done with PortAudio, should be able to be replicated 
</I>&gt;<i> without me rewriting the whole app. I've got a C# binding for PortAudio 
</I>&gt;<i> that works under Windows, thanks to some cut and paste work and a friendly 
</I>&gt;<i> W32 OSS developer.
</I>
    I have found a class called AudioPortal which uses DirectX
assemblies, you should get rid of it to be mono compatible, maybe you
could use SDL, there is a mono binding called SDL.NET
( <A HREF="http://cs-sdl.sourceforge.net">http://cs-sdl.sourceforge.net</A> ) it will work under most of the
platforms that mono is available.


&gt;<i> Now what I really need is someone who is enthusiastic about Linux, audio, 
</I>&gt;<i> and deployment, and has some spare time to work with me. Failing that, if 
</I>&gt;<i> someone could fill in the following enourmous blanks in my picture of the 
</I>&gt;<i> world:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) What's the Linux equivalent of a DLL, and can they be written using 
</I>&gt;<i> Mono? Is there a Mono project to build PortAudio.dll for Linux?
</I>

    The DLL (*.dll) equivalent on Linux is called SO (*.so) . 

    It looks like PortAudio project has been stalled since 2003, so
maybe SDL.NET would be a good alternative.


&gt;<i> 2) What's the likely hood that naive statement #1 above is true? I haven't 
</I>&gt;<i> done anything fancy with web services or databases, just some controls that 
</I>&gt;<i> I paint myself and an audio output class (which was previously done with 
</I>&gt;<i> DirectX and in preparation for this has now been part-way converted to 
</I>&gt;<i> PortAudio).
</I>

        Maybe you could have some minor problems with the controls you
paint yourself, but it's better to try it first.


&gt;<i> 3) How does one deploy for Linux these days? Do you all still run makefiles 
</I>&gt;<i> and stuff (groan...)? Does Mono have Linux equivalents for locations like 
</I>&gt;<i> $rootdrive:\$docs+settings\$current user\application data? (That would be 
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/$username/etc right?)
</I>


    To distribute the source code you could use nant it will work under
Windows (there are visual studio plug-ins for this) and on linux also.

    To distribute the binaries



&gt;<i> I guess really what I'm asking is, would anyone like to take my source and 
</I>&gt;<i> make it go under Linux, then tell me how they did it and what I need to do 
</I>&gt;<i> to make the fortnightly release. :-) Failing that bear with me while I ask 
</I>&gt;<i> a whole heap of dumb questions about installing Linux and Mono... :-D
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/offtopic&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hve a nice day,
</I>&gt;<i> Aaron.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PS You guys rock for making and using Mono in the first place. If you had 
</I>&gt;<i> only been a few months earlier I might have been doing this the right way 
</I>&gt;<i> from the start. :-)
