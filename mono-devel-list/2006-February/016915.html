<PRE>Hello Paolo,

&gt;<i> &gt; I've been experimenting with calling
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mono_image_verify_tables and mono_method_verify a la
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pedump, but I think verification is erroneously
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; failing, especially when verifying branching. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> mono_method_verify () has been superseded by verification during
</I>&gt;<i> JIT time. The latter is more correct and complete, though a few
</I>&gt;<i> checks are still missing.
</I>
A few weeks ago I asked about something related to this, currently when
the JIT encounters something it does not like, it bails out in the form
of a g_abort, and the question was whether there were any reasons not to
try to recover from this gracefully and return an exception.

Zoltan suggested that we should implement a proper verifier, but if the
right way of doing verification is by sending the method to the JIT,
then we should go down the path I proposed (email pasted at the end).

Miguel.

                               Hi,

  There are no problems with these AFAIK, it is just a _lot_ of work.
IMHO, instead of
modifying the JIT, we should implement a proper verifier which we need anyway.
