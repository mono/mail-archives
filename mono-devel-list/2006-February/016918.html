Hello,

&gt;<i> I've been working with Mono on Windows for a while, and now I'm
</I>&gt;<i> transitioning to Linux. I'm fairly new to Linux though. I recently
</I>&gt;<i> installed Suse 10, which seems to have Mono pre-installed by default.
</I>&gt;<i> However, it is not the latest version of Mono. What is the easiest
</I>&gt;<i> way to upgrade a Mono installation? I tried using the Linux installer
</I>&gt;<i> for x86 from <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Downloads,">http://www.mono-project.com/Downloads,</A> but it is not
</I>&gt;<i> clear to me whether this is going to update my existing installation
</I>&gt;<i> or create a completely new installation. How can I make sure that it
</I>&gt;<i> updates?
</I>
The installer is for people who want to try Mono quickly.

If you have SUSE, pick the RPM packages for your specific distribution
from the Downloads page, they come in a zip file with lots of rpms on
it.

Then upgrade your Mono installation like this:

rpm -Uvh *.rpm

(In the directory where you unziped the downloaded file).



Is that right?
  I have suse 9.2 pro (to $90 version)
  My understanding is that upgradeing th ethe latets version will break the applications that come with Suse, and that you need to use a profile to add a second version of Mono.
  I have not upgraded yet because someone posted infor on installing under a proffile, but not how to use it afterwards. I could not find anything on profiles in the documnets.
  I am sure I am being dumb here, but I have been using Windows for decades, what do you expect.
  Dennis
