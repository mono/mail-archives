<PRE>Hi, I tried to create a bug but was unsuccessful.  I created an account at Novell, wrote the bug, but when I submit, it fails.
 
I was wondering if you could help me out on one thing.
 
As you know, my problem is when I cast a long to a double on the ARM.  My float ops seem to work.  It's only the cast (for now :) that causes me a problem.
 
By looking through the IL, I think its the opcode conv.r8 that may code me a problem.  But I'm trying to understand the code path of where in the jit is this done.
 
Can you help me out on this?

Reporting a bug is the way to go.Anyway, it's a really bad idea to use floating point under ARM as the performance is terrible.In the long run you are better by eliminating it's uses.

I know you guys must be busy with Mono 2.0 but I appreciate your responses. I would like to investigate this more thoroughly as I would like to prove to my teammates that MONO is the way to go on the ARM. I've proved it already by using other components.  This casting issue (gint64 to double, where gint64 is signed long long, 8 bytes) makes my XSP server crash.  Is  there some doc about jit, opcode conversion, etc..  I trying to find the link between the generate IL in my test app and the conversion in the mono source&#201; Also, am I reporting my issue on the proper page?  Should I open a defect for more inspection?

The 2.0 release has some issues with soft-float.It shoule be due to the way we convert float ops to soft-float calls.

I noticed there was some kind of test under the mini folder named basic-float.cs.  I noticed that some tests do exactly why my app test does. I ran the tests and noticed that all tests that want to convert a long to double fail, which is my problem. When running on the ARM, I added a trace in mono_lconv_to_r8.  When I look at the return value (which is a gint64 casted to double), the value is OK. Can someone tell why the casted value is OK in mono_lconv_to_r8 but not in the tests?  Should I look for something else?

In order words, the result of my test program is the same with 1.9.1 and the branch 2.0. Could someone point me when in MONO I could find the code that handles the cast from long to double?

I haven't tried you fix yet since I'm working from the branch 2.0 and not the current head. I used the work around that was provided.  I got things to compile but now I have a runtime issue. I get the following error at runtime: ** (Loader.exe:1116): WARNING **: unknown opcode r4const in mono_arch_output_basic_block()** ERROR **: file mini-arm.c: line 3242 (mono_arch_output_basic_block): should not be reachedaborting...Trace/breakpoint trapI'm running a sample test on floats and doubles as specified in the in the first part of the e-mail. I've looked into the file mini-arm.c and it would seem (if I'm reading this right) that the ARM_FPU_FPA needs to be defined. I will try this but in version 1.9.1, there was a FPU check in the configure script.  I've looked in the config.log but don't see this. Am I making sense?

Yes, enable-minimal does exactly what you want.Thou the issue you found should be properly handled by the configure script.Massi, do you mind taking a look at that? If you have too much stuff on your hand this week Ican take a look at how to add proper configure foo around.

It is interesting what you say since I was actually going through all the changesets since 1.9.1 and I noticed many fixes regarding th earm, softfloat, ... I will get the latest code and try it out.  Thanks.

A lot of bugs with soft float has been fixed for the 2.0 release and even more work went in the current development branch.Please test with the 2.0 snapshot builds and report your bugs so we can fix then in time for the release.

Hi, I'm trying to run mono 1.9.1 on the arm (ARM9).  I have an issue when I try to cast a long to a double.  It simply does nothing. 
&#183;         I'm using soft float in FPA (actually, the configure script seems to detect it properly -&gt; it defines ARM_FPU_FPA).
&#183;         I'm using GNU EABI.
&#183;         When I do a mathematical operation on doubles, it works (Test in C#).
&#183;         When I print (Console.WriteLine) a double, it works (Test in C#).
&#183;         When I cast an int to a double, it works.
&#183;         I tried to define ARM_FPU_NONE and it generates an ExecutionEngineException (so, obviously, I dropped it.)
&#183;         I tried to define __ARM_EABI__ and it generates an ExecutionEngineException (so, obviously, I dropped it.) When I cast a long to a double, it doesn't work. Here is what I do: int i = 1234;long l = 1234;float f = 1234.56;double d = 1234.56;double result = 64; result = (double)i;Console.WriteLine(&quot;Result (cast from int):  &quot; + result); -&gt;  It shows me 1234.  This is good. result = 64;result = (double)f;Console.WriteLine(&quot;Result (cast from float):  &quot; + result); -&gt;  It shows me 1234.56.  This is also very good. result = 64;result = (double)I;Console.WriteLine(&quot;Result (cast from long):  &quot; + result); -&gt;  It shows me 64 ????  This is not good. Am I missing something? Any other pointers?
