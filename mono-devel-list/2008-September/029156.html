<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> So Fedora doesn't do noarch packages?  
</I>
No, we do have noarch packages. Non-architecture specific things (like
fonts and config scripts) go in them.

&gt;<i> What Geoff was getting at is bi-arch installations.  In Debian and in
</I>&gt;<i> openSUSE we can install both architectures at once.  Packages that are
</I>&gt;<i> managed-only are marked as noarch and shared between 32 and 64-bit, so
</I>&gt;<i> this scenario doesn't work well for the other major distros.
</I>
Correct. Fedora/RedHat certainly build for a specific architecture.
Upshot, compile it on a 64 bit platform and it's done with 64 bit
optimisations from the compiler and you end up with a package which
works optimised under 64 bit systems.

&gt;<i> To summarize a bit: we've recommended that only API-stable libraries go
</I>&gt;<i> into the GAC and that anyone who wants to use an API-unstable library
</I>&gt;<i> should package their own copy of it so that API-incompatibilities do not
</I>&gt;<i> break them.  This is a good policy.
</I>
And one I totally agree with. It's even how we package in Fedora. If
it's unstable, it goes in %{_libdir}/package_name. 

&gt;<i> The idea of moving the gac to /usr/share and putting package-specific
</I>&gt;<i> libraries in /usr/share/{package} has been kicked around for a while and
</I>&gt;<i> is worth discussing rationally.  It breaks tradition, but that tradition
</I>&gt;<i> was forged in pre-bi-arch days and maybe we should change it.
</I>
True. Given the neutrality of mono, it would seem to be the logical
place for API stable binaries.

&gt;<i> Side note: I've always thought /usr/lib64 was a bad move.  /usr/lib
</I>&gt;<i> should be your native arch (whatever that is) and /usr/lib32 should be
</I>&gt;<i> the foreign arch.  But this breaks third-party 32-bit packages working
</I>&gt;<i> properly on a 64-bit machine so we are stuck with /usr/lib64.
</I>
I can see the logic in that, however, I've always thought that /usr/lib
should be the architecture specific lib with /usr/lib32 being the 32 bit
lib on a 64 bit box (and vice versa!).

TTFN
