The other issue with calling fork() is that, to quote an ancient IRC
discussion:

&lt; lupus&gt; fork is tricky and likely won't work
&lt; lupus&gt; anything can happen: the child process is not setup to execute mono code
&lt; lupus&gt; an immediate exec may or may not work

Alas, I didn't get any further details, but that was enough for me to
remove fork() from Syscall: if it can't ever be reliably called, then it
shouldn't be callable.

My guess is that since Mono is multithreaded, and locks/etc. are
required to generate JITed code, it's possible that &quot;during&quot; your fork()
call another thread is busy JITing away, holding the JIT lock, and after
the fork() call the new process will have only a single thread, and
those locks would still be &quot;held&quot; (even though there's no thread holding
the locks in the new process), resulting in deadlock when you try to JIT
the Syscall.exec() call.  This would be Bad, and decidedly non-trivial
to debug should this ever happen.
