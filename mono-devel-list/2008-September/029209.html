<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Perhaps some members of the Mono team use gui-compare, but I think end-users
</I>&gt;<i> / third-party developers appreciate an easy way to consult the API
</I>&gt;<i> compatibility level of certain types/members.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The only painful part of the online class status pages (that I see) is that
</I>&gt;<i> the masterinfo files are not automatically updated (after changes to
</I>&gt;<i> mono-api-info). This could be scheduled as part of the win32 buildbot
</I>&gt;<i> though.
</I>
Well, the masterinfo files are really static.   Every time there is a
new release, someone goes scavenging for all the files, and runs
mono-api-info on the given assemblies and then we version the result.

The actual masterinfos that we have are all listed in
mono-tools/gui-compare/InfoManager.cs.  Just grep for &quot;Uri&quot; there.

So its merely an issue of fixing the build, and running more
mono-api-diffs and generate more web pages for each of the profiles we
want to compare.   I think those should be:

	1.1
	2.0
	3.5 SP1

On a side note: the generation of the masterinfo files is less that
stellar.  We have used a mix of the Reflection-based tools, and the
Cecil tools to extract the information, and they are *slightly*
different.

In the last batch (done for 3.5SP1) I used the Cecil tools for half the
assemblies (those that lived under Windows/) and reflection ones for the
ones that live under &quot;Reference Assemblies&quot; because the Cecil ones
required an assembly resolver that did not work.

So the result is mixed.

&gt;<i> Does gui-compare use the same &quot;masterinfo&quot; input files (for .NET) as
</I>&gt;<i> corcompare?
</I>
Yes.

</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What was the reason for discontinuing the (online) class status pages?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We never really discontinued it, at least in my case, I stopped caring. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> They were just difficult to maintain, and doing quick changes were not
</I>&gt;<i> reflected quickly (we had to wait a few hours for either the process to
</I>&gt;<i> run, or setup a local system which was never well documented and was
</I>&gt;<i> messy). 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Chris Toshok wrote gui-compare, which was very useful to quickly iterate
</I>&gt;<i> over an API and have since then barely used the Web UI.  I am not sure
</I>&gt;<i> if others have done it, but I think some of us just stopped using it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that a web version has a lot of value, and would love to keep it
</I>&gt;<i> around, but in its current form its painful to deal with.   The other
</I>&gt;<i> bit that is important to point out is that it has not been upgraded to
</I>&gt;<i> deal with the various new profiles, that is something that would have to
</I>&gt;<i> be done as well.
