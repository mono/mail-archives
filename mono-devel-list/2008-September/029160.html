<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; So what happens if I install 32-bit and 64-bit mono on a 64-bit box, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; get 2 of every .dll?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No. When you update via yum, the correct package is installed for your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; architecture. If you then decide to use a non-Fedora RPM, then that's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when things go potty and you get 2 of every dll.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think you're missing something.  openSUSE 64-bit has a `linux32`
</I>&gt;<i> program to launch a new program as a 32-bit app instead of as a 64-bit
</I>&gt;<i> app.  This is useful for things like configure scripts or when you want
</I>&gt;<i> to build a 32-bit-targeted binary on a 64-bit platform.
</I>
Fair enough for SuSE. 

Different distos do things differently. I think the point here is not so
much where the binaries/libs go, but more the configure scripts. If they
didn't have hardwired lines like $(prefix)/lib but used $(libdir) then
really any distributor could build correctly for any platform as the
libs would always end up in the distros correct place.

&gt;<i> Similarly, openSUSE has a mono-core-32bit package which provides mono32,
</I>&gt;<i> which runs Mono as a 32-bit program instead of as a 64-bit program.
</I>&gt;<i> This is particularly useful if you need to P/Invoke to 32-bit only
</I>&gt;<i> shared libraries...
</I>
If it's a win32 dll, the advice is to put it in /usr/lib/somewhere.
Under fedora, if I want to run monodevelop (say) then the monodevelop
script in /usr/bin points to %{_libdir}/monodevelop/monodevelop.exe
rather than $(prefix)/lib - this would go against the packaging
guidelines.

&gt;<i> Consequently, it should be quite possible to have *two* mono's
</I>&gt;<i> installed, one 32-bit and one 64-bit, and use e.g. linux32 or mono32 to
</I>&gt;<i> control which one is executed.
</I>
We have that already. Before it (literally) exploded, by 64 bit box used
the 32 bit version of Firefox - mainly as I needed to use flash and
gnash wasn't cutting it.

&gt;<i> Yum architecture shouldn't matter, as you have both installed, and
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;non-Fedora RPMs&quot; shouldn't matter, as they're both from Fedora.
</I>
What I meant was (say) someone installed the Fedora (rawhide) Mono.
Currently this is at 2.0RC1 on a 64 bit box. If they then went and
installed a mandriva RPM (or SuSE RPM) which needed GAC. There is no
g/tee that the mandriva RPM installed to /usr/lib64 or if it installed
to /usr/lib that GAC would be found.

&gt;<i> So what happens there?  Do you get two copies of every core assembly, or
</I>&gt;<i> just one?
</I>
You get a mess unless you're careful!

&gt;<i> For example, openSUSE's mono-core-32bit packages only
</I>&gt;<i> provides /usr/bin/mono32, libMonoPosixHelper.so, libikvm-native.sl, and
</I>&gt;<i> libmono.so{,.0,.0.0.0} all compiled for 32-bit processors.  There are no
</I>&gt;<i> duplicate assemblies.
</I>
But on a 64 bit box, they're not correctly optimised on compilation
which can result in a slow down.

TTFN

Paul
