<PRE>So Fedora doesn't do noarch packages?  Interesting!  I will admit I've
always had a bad feeling about sharing packages across architectures.

What Geoff was getting at is bi-arch installations.  In Debian and in
openSUSE we can install both architectures at once.  Packages that are
managed-only are marked as noarch and shared between 32 and 64-bit, so
this scenario doesn't work well for the other major distros.

The document that describes our recommendations is here:
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Guidelines:Application_Deployment">http://www.mono-project.com/Guidelines:Application_Deployment</A>

To summarize a bit: we've recommended that only API-stable libraries go
into the GAC and that anyone who wants to use an API-unstable library
should package their own copy of it so that API-incompatibilities do not
break them.  This is a good policy.

The idea of moving the gac to /usr/share and putting package-specific
libraries in /usr/share/{package} has been kicked around for a while and
is worth discussing rationally.  It breaks tradition, but that tradition
was forged in pre-bi-arch days and maybe we should change it.

Side note: I've always thought /usr/lib64 was a bad move.  /usr/lib
should be your native arch (whatever that is) and /usr/lib32 should be
the foreign arch.  But this breaks third-party 32-bit packages working
properly on a 64-bit machine so we are stuck with /usr/lib64.

</I>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt; If you're on a 64 bit box, /usr/lib64/mono. Anything else,
</I>/usr/lib/mono
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So what happens if I install 32-bit and 64-bit mono on a 64-bit box, I
</I>&gt;<i> get 2 of every .dll?
</I>
No. When you update via yum, the correct package is installed for your
architecture. If you then decide to use a non-Fedora RPM, then that's
when things go potty and you get 2 of every dll.

TTFN
