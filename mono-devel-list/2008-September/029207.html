<PRE>Miguel,

Perhaps some members of the Mono team use gui-compare, but I think end-users
/ third-party developers appreciate an easy way to consult the API
compatibility level of certain types/members.

The only painful part of the online class status pages (that I see) is that
the masterinfo files are not automatically updated (after changes to
mono-api-info). This could be scheduled as part of the win32 buildbot
though.

Does gui-compare use the same &quot;masterinfo&quot; input files (for .NET) as
corcompare?

Gert

Hello,

&gt;<i> What was the reason for discontinuing the (online) class status pages?
</I>
We never really discontinued it, at least in my case, I stopped caring. 

They were just difficult to maintain, and doing quick changes were not
reflected quickly (we had to wait a few hours for either the process to
run, or setup a local system which was never well documented and was
messy). 

Chris Toshok wrote gui-compare, which was very useful to quickly iterate
over an API and have since then barely used the Web UI.  I am not sure
if others have done it, but I think some of us just stopped using it.

I agree that a web version has a lot of value, and would love to keep it
around, but in its current form its painful to deal with.   The other
bit that is important to point out is that it has not been upgraded to
deal with the various new profiles, that is something that would have to
be done as well.
