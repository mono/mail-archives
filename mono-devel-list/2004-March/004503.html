<PRE>No one seems seems to be chiming in about MSBuild, so I'll make a few 
comments. I've been pretty unhappy with the various build tools out there 
from the standpoint of compiling C# projects, so I looked at MSBuild a few 
days ago. It looks as good as anything else, and it would be nice to have a 
Free implementation of it.

In particular, it would be useful to write the tools with an object-oriented 
interface so that IDE's could use the facilities of the build system.
