<PRE>Hi,
    I was wondering if there was any way to start external processes using
any of the mono class libraries.  I know that in .NET you can run an
external process using the System.Diagnostics.Process class, but I'm not
sure if it is available in mono or if the functionality is implemented in a
different namespace.
 
Thanks a lot.
 
Andrew Gleave
