</I>
Getting the DLL to work is rather redundant as the class I want to use 
isn't yet working (System.Drawing.Bitmap). I see there are still debug 
Console.WriteLines in there and I doesn't work for even the simplest 
load from a file operation.

I was going to check what the status was on the class. If no-one else is 
actively doing anything I guess I'll have to do it myself.
