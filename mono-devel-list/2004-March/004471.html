Sounds like Platform Invoke, depending on how you define &quot;unmanaged
objects.&quot;  Unmanaged C++ objects?  Or &quot;object&quot; meaning &quot;memory&quot;? 
Something else?

Simple enough -- you want to write a compiler that translates the XSD
into a set of types.  Look into System.Reflection.Emit.  Looking at the
source to &quot;mcs&quot; might be helpful as well.

My &quot;slight kickoff&quot; is above, though you haven't provided much
information about what *exactly* you're trying to do.

One thing to keep in mind is that Mono is a statically-typed
environment.  Which means that you can't have existing, pre-compiled
code directly reference a set of classes you'll be generating at
run-time, as the classes won't exist yet. :-)

A workaround would be to define a set of interfaces/base classes that
your generated code will implement/derive from, and that existing code
can compile against.  Regardless, your design will need to take this
into consideration.
