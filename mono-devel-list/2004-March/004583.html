<PRE>MessageHello John,

Carlos is working on the SslServerStream. Once it is finished XSP would make
an excellent test bed for it.
And supporting SSL on XSP is a worthy feature in itself ;-).

P.S. my 2c - Gonzalo, or some other hackers, may have better ideas for XSP.

  Subject: [Mono-devel-list] How to contribute (small amount's) to XSP dev ?


  Hey guys,

  I was thinking I might like to get back into a little ASP.net work and was
wondering if i might be able to spend some time helping out with XSP.

  I don't generally have large amounts of time to do much, but I can usually
get at least an hour or two a week to do some mono related hacking.

  I was basically curious about what the latest was with XSP, how you guys
decided on what to do next, and where (if at all) there was a list of small
things yet to be done are?

  Regards,

  JBA
