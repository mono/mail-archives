<PRE>Hi all

I'm building monodebugger from CVS to use it with monodevelop. I ended up with 
this error:

make[3]: Entering directory 
`/home/hofhy/mono/monodebugger/debugger/frontends/scripting'
../../../mcs/jay/jay -ctv &lt; skeleton Parser.jay &gt; Parser.tmp &amp;&amp; mv -f 
Parser.tmp Parser.cs
/bin/sh: line 1: ../../../mcs/jay/jay: No such file or directory
make[3]: *** [Parser.cs] Error 127

I looked for mcs/jay/jay but I could only find monodebugger/mcs/jay/jay.1 so I 
modified monodebugger/frontends/scripting/Makefile to make it say jay.1 on 
line 113. Probably this is not the correct solution because now even after 
some chmodding and running as root I am getting:

make[3]: Entering directory 
`/home/hofhy/mono/monodebugger/debugger/frontends/scripting'
../../../mcs/jay/jay.1 -ctv &lt; skeleton Parser.jay &gt; Parser.tmp &amp;&amp; mv -f 
Parser.tmp Parser.cs
/bin/sh: line 1: ../../../mcs/jay/jay.1: Permission denied
make[3]: *** [Parser.cs] Error 126

I must say that this might be totally incorrect thinking because I am just a 
beginner in C# and have little understanding on how mono works on the inside. 
I actually want to build monodevelop to practice some things I learned from 
lessons .net in mono and eventually writing some documentation on it because 
there seems to be little for beginners like me. I have build monodevelop in 
previous versions but the most recent version uses monodebugger. I would like 
to enable the debugger as this would be very helpfull for me.

If there is any preveious tread about this I would be glad to hear about it.


Thx in advance !
