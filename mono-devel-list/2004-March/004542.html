Like Jon, I say `dont publish now' mostly due to the patent issue (As he
said, it is nearly at the point where reading Mono related articles is
just annoying).

However, I *would* encourge you to start writing; you are looking to
take on a pretty big task. If you start writing now, you have more time
to get reviews/comments from hackers and more importantly, the Novell
team.

Of course, you have to be prepared to keep it up to date, so that by 1.0
you can publish. However, I am sure you are aware of that.

Good luck, you seem to have alot of great ideas!

-- Ben
