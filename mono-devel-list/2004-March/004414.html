mono keeps a local copy of compiled assemblies in its runtime folder. 
So, when you compiled mono, the runtime was already modified and so a 
new version was added but the libraries you used to compile mono for the 
first time was still in the runtime folder.

I think this time you will have to download the monolite and copy the 
corlib.dll to you &lt;monodir&gt;/lib folder. And compile mcs from sources.

To avoid that in future, the order you could use ( I use it for my own 
development) is the following:


cvs update mcs -d
make in mcs.
if there is any modification in runtime version you will get it when 
trying to compile the first assembly after compiled mscorlib.dll as it 
will have a newer number as your mono runtime. You will get the same 
error as you said.

go to mono folder.
cvs update
make make install.

now go back to mcs and do a make install ( and this will copy the new 
mscorlib.dll to mono system allowing you to continue )

or copy the mcs/class/lib/mscorlib.dll to you monoinstall/lib folder and 
continue with make in mcs folder.

I personally use the make install as this diminishes my typing :)


I hope it helps
