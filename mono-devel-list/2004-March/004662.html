Silly question, but what's the license for Rhino?  A cursory look at the
site didn't bring enlightenment.

The current convention is that managed assemblies are under the MIT/X11
license.  Which (of course!) isn't consistent; Gtk# is LGPL.

Better summary: all assemblies in mcs/class are MIT/X11.

Regardless, I imagine that GPL libraries won't be accepted, LGPL
libraries might be, and MIT/X11 (or BSD without advertising clause) will
be accepted.
