<PRE>Hey guys,
 
I was thinking I might like to get back into a little ASP.net work and
was wondering if i might be able to spend some time helping out with
XSP.
 
I don't generally have large amounts of time to do much, but I can
usually get at least an hour or two a week to do some mono related
hacking.
 
I was basically curious about what the latest was with XSP, how you guys
decided on what to do next, and where (if at all) there was a list of
small things yet to be done are?
 
Regards,
 
JBA
