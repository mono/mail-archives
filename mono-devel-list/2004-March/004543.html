<PRE>Hello!

&gt;<i> I thought about contributing some Mono articles to some Windows based .NET 
</I>&gt;<i> sites such as CodeProject, CodeGuru and some of the C# websites out there.  I 
</I>&gt;<i> think it would be cool if people were tempted to download Mono, try to build 
</I>&gt;<i> their applications, and either have lots of success, or submit lots of bug 
</I>&gt;<i> reports :)  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have quite a lot of text already written in a report I'm working on, but I 
</I>&gt;<i> wondered if anyone wanted to help, offer ideas, or point me towards stuff that 
</I>&gt;<i> they have already created that could be dropped in, or edited.  I have thought 
</I>&gt;<i> up the following structure:
</I>
This is a wonderful outline for a replacement for the Monkeyguide.

If you write this article, I wonder if we could also get our hands after
publishing to include it as part of our documentation?  I know that Erik
wanted to work on something along these lines.

Your table of contents is very interesting from that perspective, and I
think very very valuable.

The audience you have selected is not the same as the Slashdot crowd who
as Jon and Ben point out have resorted to bring up legal issues every
time and they tend to dominate the discussion.

For instance, I presented Mono to a Microsoft crowd recently, and the
kind of questions and topics they are interested in are very different
than what you see on the Linux/open source sites, where the hate for
Microsoft grows large, and any tool they have at their disposal is used
(like the recent `RelaxNG is patented because I saw XML mentioned on the
patent' nonsense).

Miguel.
