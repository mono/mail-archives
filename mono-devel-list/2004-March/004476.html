<PRE>Thanks Jon...

to be more precise, the goal of my work is to dynamically (at runtime)
integrate type information into the Mono runtime and thus allow Mono
programs to use externally defined types as if they were available in the
managed environment. The external types could come from C / C++
applications, and they must have a well-formed type-description given as an
XSD-schema, which resides somewhere in a kind of metadata.

At the moment, everything is quite fuzzy for me, so I'm happy about every
kind of help. So, thank you for your answer, now i know where to start. I
hope I'm getting more into Mono the next days and can contribute to the
Mono-project in the future...

best regards,
august

</I>&gt;<i> One thing to keep in mind is that Mono is a statically-typed

</I>&gt;<i> run-time, as the classes won't exist yet. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A workaround would be to define a set of interfaces/base classes that
</I>&gt;<i> your generated code will implement/derive from, and that existing code
</I>&gt;<i> can compile against.  Regardless, your design will need to take this
</I>&gt;<i> into consideration.
