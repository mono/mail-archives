<PRE>Hello

For my thesis I have to implement a runtime mechanism that allows managed 
programs to use unmanaged objects and vice versa. If I'm rigth the best 
way to do this is to implement COM, XPCOM or ORBit.
My questions about that are:
Which of these technologies is the best to solve my problem (if you think 
I should use one of this)?
Has there be done any work in mono to use unmanaged objects?

I would be glad if you could give me some information what I should do 
first and where to get more information how I could do my task.

Thanks,

Friedrich
