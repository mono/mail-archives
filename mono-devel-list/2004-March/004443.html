<PRE>So I procrastinated from doing school work by tracking down this bug...

I just got Ivan Hamilton's email, but since I have my email ready to go, 
I'll send it anyway. :)  Plus, I have a slightly different take on 
fixing the bug, although I think Ivan's fix is just as good.

</I>
The problem was in creating any reference-type array (except string and 
object) with more than 6 nulls.  Nulls, being a type of constant (and 
the only constant that can appear in these reference type arrays), 
tricked mcs into thinking the array could be initialized from a static 
field of values, which mcs would only do if there were more than 6 values.

Attached is a patch that I can commit if the appropriate people think 
it's ok.

While I was looking at this, two possible improvements to array creation 
came to mind.  Do null elements of arrays need to be initialized?  The 
CIL specs don't seem to say, which I guess means yes.  (Though numeric 
elements are initialized to zero.)  The other thing is that filling in 
the array elements uses a local variable to hold the array while it's 
being created.  Is there any performance boost to be gained by using 
dup's instead of ldloc's?
