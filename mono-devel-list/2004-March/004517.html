<PRE>Marcus,

Thanks for the note.  Having a single build format that could unify
development on windows and linux w/ Mono would be great IMO.  I know there
is communication between the MSBuild team and the Nant team, but I'm not
sure how far they are going to go to make the two tools work with one
another.  The most we could probably expect are complimentary tasks that
invoke each other's tools.

I agree also that having a programatic API to access the tool is essential.


Louis

No one seems seems to be chiming in about MSBuild, so I'll make a few 
comments. I've been pretty unhappy with the various build tools out there 
from the standpoint of compiling C# projects, so I looked at MSBuild a few 
days ago. It looks as good as anything else, and it would be nice to have a 
Free implementation of it.

In particular, it would be useful to write the tools with an object-oriented

interface so that IDE's could use the facilities of the build system.
