<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> What's wrong with Runtime vs SDK separation as it is done in .NET ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why do you want to isolate DirectoryServices, Drawing, ASP.NET, ADO.NET, SWF
</I>&gt;<i> and Remoting?
</I>&gt;<i> Is this related to the patent issues ? Unless there are legal problems, I
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't split mono at all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The great thing about .NET is that you don't have to worry about
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies or system differences. You just assume that all the core stuff
</I>&gt;<i> needed to run your app is there ready to use.
</I>
There are various ideas at play here.  The first one is that Mono today
implements two separate stacks:

	<A HREF="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/tmp/two-stacks.png">http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/tmp/two-stacks.png</A>

For instance, the desktop app developers do not really need the ASP.NET
stack installed in their machines;  And the same goes for those doing
web sites: they do not really need to pull in Gtk#, Gtk and Wine to have
a fully functional system.

Today we have kind of a &quot;soft&quot; dependency in other packages, and things
only work if you have installed them before to avoid making Mono a huge
download.

By splitting things up, we can actually get the proper dependencies in
place, and let people choose what they want and need.

We will likely have a `meta' package mono that will basically pull every
dependency.
