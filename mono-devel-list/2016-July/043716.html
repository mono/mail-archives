<PRE>I have been trying to get a good looking demo to show off Mono to some
folks new to the technology. I used the NerdDinner app as it exercised a
number of interesting things. However, there is one problem that is
causing some grief. I am able to register an account and sign on. However,
it does not appear that whatever signing on does is not working. The sign
on results in SetAuthCookie() being called, but when I click on something
that ends up driving a method with the [Authorize] tag, I get redirected
to the login form again. This is on mono 4.4 on s390x. When I run it on
4.0 on Intel it works fine.

I do not understand the mechanics of the auth cookie and how it is used so
am not sure it is some endian issue, something that has changed with mono
4.4, or something entirely different.

I am looking for suggestions to look within the Mono code to determine
where the problem may be.
