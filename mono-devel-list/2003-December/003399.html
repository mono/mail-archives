Yeap, but finalizers called by vm should only handle unmanaged resources 
as the destruction of other managed objects may already have occured and 
vm can't garantee that your references to managed objects are still valid.

In my case, I'd like to still be able to clean up my managed objects. :(

Uhmm, that's sound interesting...
I will check that.


Thanks Jarek.

Also, sorry for the delay in response.
