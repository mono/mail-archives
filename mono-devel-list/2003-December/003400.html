Uhmmmm, what you said does really make sense.

I also thought this way: I could just leave the pool as it is and so the 
dispose(false) of the tcpclient object would release the unmanaged 
connection. The only problem is a side effect of this: The server logs a 
message about the EOF in the client connection. But I think this would 
be a side effect that we could live with. I think the other providers, 
like sql server does exactly this, but sql server doesn't logs about the 
eof in the client connection.


Thanks Reggie and sorry for late response.
