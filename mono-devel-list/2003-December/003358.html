Nah, it's fine ;-)

This is a brilliant idea! Not only will I add basic information as
you've suggested, I think it will also be perfect to write down pending
tasks for interested contributors to work on, as there is still a lot of
work to be done.

Thanks for the suggestion ;-) I'll write it up tomorrow.

Unfortunately, I don't think I'll ever be able to escape the &quot;burden&quot; of
packaging Cairo. Even though it seems perfectly reasonable to track CVS
Cairo when we're not doing a release; many of our contributors and
users, who regularly build from CVS, simply cannot keep up an additional
dependency. This is why I've decided to only update my Cairo
dependencies when I can also provide new packages, so that there
wouldn't be an extra hurdle imposed on potential Mono contributors and
users.

An aside: Recently, Carl announced that he will be uploading 'official'
development snapshots in <A HREF="http://cairographics.org/snapshots/.">http://cairographics.org/snapshots/.</A> In the
past, I've been making my own Cairo tarballs during the Mono release
cycle; in the future, I'll always be using Carl's tarballs instead.

It is obvious that this is not the optimal solution, let's try to see if
we could improve the situation after the holidays.

Thanks again,

Duncan.
