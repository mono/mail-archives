<PRE>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi all!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm working in getting connection pool in Npgsql.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But I'm facing a little problem I wasn't aware before:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When I close the connection, if it is being pooled, I return it back to
</I>&gt;<i> pool. Ok, but what happens when the client program exits? I mean, if it
</I>&gt;<i> specify Npgsql to use a pool, it opens a connection, close it and so
</I>&gt;<i> exits, who will release the connection from the pool?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know that the Stream object handle the unmanaged tcp connection and on
</I>&gt;<i> its dispose(false) method it will release the unmanaged connection
</I>&gt;<i> cleanly, but even with this, Postgresql still logs about receiving eof
</I>&gt;<i> from the client connection.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was checking the bytefx and sqlclient code about connection pool and I
</I>&gt;<i> couldn't see anything about this too. So I suppose that with their code
</I>&gt;<i> this also happens.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Pedro, guys, do you have any idea about that?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was thinking about some way to register an eventhandler which would
</I>&gt;<i> notice me about the app domain unloading where I could check the
</I>&gt;<i> connection pool and release any connection there is in it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would this be possible? There may be some other clearer solution?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I don't think I see the problem here.  The only unmanaged resource we are
really concerned with is the connection to the database.  The database has
to be able to cleanly handle a dropped connection so domain unloading will
dispose the socket connections for us.    The rest of the pooling is
completely managed and doesn't need disposing.

Am I missing something obvious here?

Reggie
