<PRE>Hi,

I managed to get some spare time today to attempt this again but I am
still getting the same error.

The steps I took was to download monocharge-20031208 and properly
install it (I think/hope - I copied the dlls to /usr/lib and the exe's
to /usr/bin). At least now invoking mcs --version or mono --version
returns a newer version number than it used to. In particular

Mono C# compiler version 0.29.99.42728

Then I entered the mono directory (module) that I had freshly downloaded
from anon CVS and ran autogen.sh followed by make.

When I execute the &quot;make fullbuild&quot; step, mcs.exe builds fine but
building mscorlib.dll quickly bombs out with the following error message
from mcs.

error CS0509: class `System.Reflection.MonoGenericInst': Cannot inherit
from sealed class `System.MonoType'

Obviously I need to study C# a heck of a lot more (at present I don't
know much more than &quot;hello world&quot; style knowledge). I don't know how to
debug the cause of this compilation failure as it is starting to stretch
my C# knowledge. For example the MonoType class is indeed marked as
sealed in my copy of mcs/class/corlib/System/MonoType.cs and hence I
didn't think the MonoGenericInst class could derive from it (as the
error message says). Obviously there's a gap in my C# knowledge
somewhere in this department.

Does anyone have any further suggestions? If someone more knowledgeable
than me could point me in the right direction of what I should be
investigating (i.e. is it possibly pickup up reminants of a previous
install, or does it look like an incomplete CVS update i've made etc
etc) I'm more than happy to go off investigating on my own for a while.

Thanks,
