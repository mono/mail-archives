<PRE>Hello Fawad,

Sigh.

Every week, someone comes up to me (on AIM, on IRC, on bugzilla, on the
mailing list), and reminds me of this problem. I just want to make sure
everyone knows that I am fully aware of this problem.

The reason why I haven't fixed this bug is because I haven't found time
to update and package new Cairo and libpixman packages. Doing the
packaging for the 4 distributions require a fair bit of time, and it
also doesn't help that I'm on holiday in Hong Kong right now.

I'll bake new tarballs and update the header file once I get back to
Boston after Christmas. For now, either roll back to the release RPMs
from 0.29, or just keep a patch on your local tree.

Happy holidays,

Duncan.
