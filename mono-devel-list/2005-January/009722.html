<PRE>Sorry to be a pessimist here. BUT in the past Borland has promised a lot
and delivered very little. Especially to their C++ community.

I was a customer of Borland since Verion 1 of Builder, until version 5,
which I spent many many pounds on. I stupidly purchased Kylix and even
then believed their promisses.

If they are monitoring this group then Hi. However I would suggest that
the Mono developers should continue their brilliant work with making Mono
an open source .NET platform, which they have so far managed to do
brilliantly.

If other software vendors wish to support it then maybe they should do
some of the running and make their apps complient, instead of expecting
others to run to them. (Ahh Microsoft how are you. Sorry went off on one
then...).

I am sure that Borland are trying very hard at the moment however I would
have thought because of their loyalty to Delphi customers they would be
very wary of doing anything that would stop backward compatability which
would seem to me to be a big hurdle for Mono integration.

Of course I maybe completely wrong and the Mono guys and girls are as we
speak integrating the Borland RTL, and Borland have placed a department of
developers to work on this very issue.
