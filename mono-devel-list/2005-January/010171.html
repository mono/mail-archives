Bounds checking will always work. It is a requirement of the CLR.

I don't think abcremoval can optimize this case.

this should never happen anyway if the configuration file is valid.

</I>
I know what are the consequences of a catch{} clause. But I really
really think that those exceptions are not a problem in this case. And
even if one of those exceptions is thrown, the error is being reported
anyway.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So out of performance, readability and correctness reasons I vote for 
</I>&gt;<i> replacing.
</I>
When I browse other people's code I often see things that I would have
implemented in a different and more elegant way (more elegant to my
opinion, of course). But I try not to touch that code unless it is
clearly buggy, unnecessary slow, uses too much memory, or it is
difficult to understand. Since that RReader code does not have any of
those issues, I keep thinking that it is not necessary to change it,
even if your solution is more elegant (BTW, I didn't write the original
code myself).

I just don't want to lose time reviewing patches that don't fix real and
reproducible bugs. But since now I've already lost that time (and even
more time writing this mail), you can commit the patch if you want.

Lluis.
