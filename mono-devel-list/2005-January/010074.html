</I>
This is a possibility as we have to write a compiler
for the scripting language anyway, but it would
complicate the compiler and make the future use of
other languages much more difficult. I suppose
theoretically we could write a tool which analysed CIL
and injected the code in to the output of any CIL
compiler allowing language inter-operation, but that
is even more hairy. On the plus side, this approach
could me made to work a lot like the current system
and so minimise changes outside the scripting engine.

&gt;<i> *) use the threadpool as initially suggested: you
</I>&gt;<i> will queue all the scripts for execution. 
</I>
Would you queue the scripts themselves and allow them
to wait on events for much of the time, or queue the
events themselves and switch script state manually?

&gt;<i> If a scripts takes lots of time to run, the other 
</I>&gt;<i> scripts will be queued to other threads: since this 
</I>&gt;<i> should happen rarely it should not be a problem, 
</I>&gt;<i> unless you also need to guarantee against denial of 
</I>&gt;<i> service attempts.
</I>
Would it be possible to use another thread to watch
for scripts which are performing denial of service
attacks and terminate their execution?

&gt;<i> Note that this means that the scripts will run 
</I>&gt;<i> concurrently.
</I>
Yes, which means that it may require lots of changes
to the rest of the system to support calls from
multiple threads.
