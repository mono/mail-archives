<PRE>Hi, 
 
I am currently working on my diploma thesis and need your help. I spent 
the last three months reading into the source code of Mono and now the 
time has come to try some things by changing mono code. 
 
Before I can start coding I need your help concerning threads: 
 
On several places in the code there are &quot;EnterCriticalSection&quot; statements, 
but until now I couldn't figure out which things need to be protected when 
accessed and which not. It seems that only writing is protected by mutexes 
and not reading - am I right? 
 
Which functions are called by multiple threads and which ones are called 
only by the starting thread --&gt; to see which ones need synchronization 
--&gt; or is synchronization only done by synchronizing the access to shared 
data structures. Which datastructures are shared? 
 
Is there any documentation about it?  
 
Thanks very much 
 
Christoph
