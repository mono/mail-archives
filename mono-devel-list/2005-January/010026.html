<PRE>&gt;<i> To avoid this the JIT _could_ produce code to replace SystemManager.
</I>&gt;<i> SecurityEnabled by false when --security isn't enabled. In this case the
</I>&gt;<i> permission creation/demand would be treated as dead code (and possibly
</I>&gt;<i> totally removed by optimizations).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	??? is it worth it ???
</I>
Before reading this paragraph I was just suggesting this.

At some point someone from a Microsoft team told me their painful
experiences with having the CAS be enabled by default for every
application and how much this hurt their performance, so I think that
this is absolutely worth it.

&gt;<i> We could also replace SystemManager.SecurityEnabled by false when it's
</I>&gt;<i> false. I.e. true can become false, but false can't become true.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a little more &quot;funky&quot; but it's a behavior of the MS runtime (at
</I>&gt;<i> least for 1.0 and 1.1, didn't try with 2.0) that I didn't understand
</I>&gt;<i> before today (not that I really tried to ;-).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         Short story: the MS runtime defaults SystemManager.
</I>&gt;<i>         SecurityEnabled to TRUE and you can switch it off anytime (if
</I>&gt;<i>         you have the rights to do so). However the results are
</I>&gt;<i>         &quot;undefined&quot; if you turn it back to TRUE.
</I>
Makes sense to me.

Miguel
