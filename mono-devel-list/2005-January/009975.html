I've attached a patch that does everything other than making this heap
walk based.

I would really rather use a hackish interface that I know is non-buggy
right now than to spend a few days working on a generalized heap walk
that will probably require the brave souls who are using my code to fix
up Beagle, etc, to spend time with weird corner cases that pop up. I am
fine with the condition that a change in the GC will break my code.
