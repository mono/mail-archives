&gt;<i> This stuff needs to be documented and the way to do it is to 
</I>&gt;<i> read the code, use grep and annotate it. Anyone can do it. 
</I>&gt;<i> Would you like to contribute? 
</I>&gt;<i> If you don't plan to contribute in the effort and just need a quick 
</I>&gt;<i> help on a data structure in particular, just ask explicitly 
</I>&gt;<i> what you need. Asking a list of all the shared data is not going to 
</I>&gt;<i> get an answer, because this stuff isn't documented yet and doing so 
</I>&gt;<i> _now_ is not scheduled for any of us: it takes time. You can help by 
</I>&gt;<i> taking 
</I>&gt;<i> a data structure and documenting that for starters, if you want. 
</I>&gt;<i> Plus, having more eyes on the code can only help find and fix the bugs 
</I>&gt;<i> that lurk in there. Right now, if I had a document describing what is 
</I>&gt;<i> shared and which locks protect what, I wouldn't tell you, because 
</I>&gt;<i> that would prevent you from reading the code and telling us about the 
</I>&gt;<i> bugs you found;-) 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> lupus 
</I> 
Thanks, I will ask again when I know exactly which data structures are 
concerned. 
 
I am working on a local copy of the 1.0.2 version, so annotating anything 
there won't help anybody ;-), and probably the most bugs I would find 
would result from my code and not from yours because I have still little 
insight in Mono. 
 
Ciao Christoph
