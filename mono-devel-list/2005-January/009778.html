<PRE>Hello Nick,

&gt;<i> That's what I have been doing mostly recently for the tests running on
</I>&gt;<i> cygwin/ms.net.  I am using the technique Sebastien mentioned, namely the
</I>&gt;<i> [Category(&quot;NotDotNet&quot;)] attribute.  This allows fairly
</I>&gt;<i> fine-grained control
</I>&gt;<i> for simply excluding tests if used properly.  You just run the tests with
</I>&gt;<i> 'nunit-console.exe /exclude=NotDotNet'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is fine for the .NET side where we are just confirming our
</I>&gt;<i> test suite,
</I>&gt;<i> but on the mono side things are different.
</I>
Yes we have a big unit/regression duality in the tests ;-).

&gt;<i> I planned to go
</I>&gt;<i> through the tests
</I>&gt;<i> again and put [Ignore(&quot;Bugzilla 39932&quot;)] and such on tests that
</I>&gt;<i> fail there.
</I>
I don't think using [Ignore] is a good idea because:
(a) the tests won't be executed under the MS runtime (with run-ondotnet).
The tests risk to bitrot a long time - to the point of not working
correctly on newer MS runtime by the time it is fixed on Mono (e.g. rarely
used classes);

(b) there is (or was) no easy way from nunit-console to &quot;try&quot; to execute an
ignored test. So this gets a little harder for people who intend to fix the
bugs in that category (as they have to change and recompile the test
assembly).

Using a different [Category] for those tests doesn't have those
inconvenients.

&gt;<i> Eventually we would get the tests to run without failures by doing this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The downside of this strategy is that someone has to go in and remove the
</I>&gt;<i> Category and/or Ignore attributes when bugs are fixed.  This is a tedious
</I>&gt;<i> and fairly uninteresting task that begs for automation (or paid
</I>&gt;<i> staff which
</I>&gt;<i> amounts to about the same).
</I>
No a fun task :( but I think it would be easier to run, periodically, the
tests in the &quot;NotMono&quot; category and see if some have been &quot;indirectly&quot;
fixed than messing with [Ignore].

&gt;<i> What would be a nice addition would be a
</I>&gt;<i> .config(urable) attribute that would exclude/include tests. Something like
</I>&gt;<i> this would be really cool:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [RunWhenBugFixed(&quot;34883&quot;)]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This attribute could lookup in a .config file for:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;BugFixed number=34883 /&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And run the test if found, and ignore otherwise.  The .config
</I>&gt;<i> file could be
</I>&gt;<i> generated automagically from bugzilla (extra points for using the Bugzilla
</I>&gt;<i> WebService for this instead of a file) (extra double supersize points for
</I>&gt;<i> writing said WebService if it doesn't exist).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think it is important to track which bug causes the test to be
</I>&gt;<i> ignored, so
</I>&gt;<i> the test can be easily found and re-activated. I also think the
</I>&gt;<i> best we have
</I>&gt;<i> right now is to use [Ignore(&quot;Bug 39392&quot;)] and also so slice up the test
</I>&gt;<i> methods if necessary moving just the Asserts that fail to a new
</I>&gt;<i> test method.
</I>&gt;<i> We don't want to be t0o heavy handed in ignoring these tests.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any comments on this?
</I>
That's a very good idea. Anybody interested in implementing this should
contact the NUnit developers and work with them to include this (or make
this a separate tool) so we can still benefits from their future versions
(and not lock ourselves with a Mono specific tool).

Sebastien
