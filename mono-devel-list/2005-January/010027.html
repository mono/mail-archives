A couple of things...

1st, I like the idea of Escape Analysis a lot.
Even without having seen any paper about it, this is an obvious
optimization... it's true that a generational GC would help as
well, but this is a more &quot;direct&quot; approach to the problem (in any
case complementary to a generational GC).
In any case it's something I'd like to see, if nobody implements
it eventually (after the more urgent things that I should do) I
would do it myself.

But (2nd) I cannot see how Paolo is blocking you.
It is probably true that Escape Analysis is expensive, so it
makes sense only with profile guided optimizations, but this is
not a good reason not to code it now, knowing that sooner or
later we *will* have that... and moreover, couldn't it be used
with AOT anyway?

Ciao,
  Massi
