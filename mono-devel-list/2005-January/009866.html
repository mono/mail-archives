It depends. Some structures can't change once inited, so they
don't need locking on read. Or there may be bugs. If you were
not so vague we could be of more help here (there could be also bugs
in this area, of course).

&gt;<i>   Which functions are called by multiple threads and which ones are called

</I>&gt;<i>   --&gt; or is synchronization only done by synchronizing the access to

</I>
Many.

&gt;<i>   Is there any documentation about it?   
</I>
I think Zoltan wrote something about it when he reviewed the code, you
may want to google it. But it may be outdated, since it was a long time ago.
If you have any specific concern about some data structure, tell us.
We need to do a full audit for threading issues before the next release 
anyway.
