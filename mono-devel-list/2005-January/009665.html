<PRE>Hello Hans,

&gt;<i> We are currently implementing .NET debugging support in X-develop 
</I>&gt;<i> (www.x-develop.com). Interfacing with the MS .NET framework is pretty 
</I>&gt;<i> easy with the documented COM debugging API (ICorDebug and friends).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> X-develop supports coding against Mono. Therefore we would like to 
</I>&gt;<i> investigate the possibility of implementing support for debugging 
</I>&gt;<i> C#/VB.net applications with Mono as well. Unfortunately Mono does not 
</I>&gt;<i> implement the Microsoft COM debugging API. Is there another documented 
</I>&gt;<i> debugging API, preferably managed?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your help.
</I>
There is a work-in-progress debugger being developed for Mono which is a
managed API.   Those are the good news.

The bad news is that we have not tested the debugger enough, so it is
known to have bugs and it also has limitations due to the lack of
real-world use.   I guess the upside is that having an IDE with
debugging support will expose the bugs faster.

The other downside is that the debugger and the debugger API only work
against the development version of Mono (Mono 1.1.xx, maybe even only
SVN).

The debugger API is available in the module `debugger' from our SVN
server.  If you guys are interested in working on this area, and
probably give us some feedback we can arrange a SVN account for you.

Miguel.
