Well, with your patch you would have never realized that bc wasn't
working. Then somebody else would have spent that time debugging
whatever error this bug could induce.

I don't think that one exception out of 16.000 calls is a problem.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reproducible bugs. But since now I've already lost that time (and even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more time writing this mail), you can commit the patch if you want.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You're talking about losing time? How much time did I lose just because

</I>
I'm sorry you lost that time, but this doesn't mean that the original
code was incorrect. What if the ++ operator stops working? do we need to
add a check for this as well in the Read() code? We don't need to. We
can write code assuming that ++ will work, as well as we can assume that
array bounds check will work. If any of those stop working somebody will
have a hard time debugging it, but it doesn't mean that code written
with those assumptions is wrong.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Lluis, I have no problem if you clearly say 'no, this won't go in, 
</I>&gt;<i> because I don't like it'.
</I>
I didn't say I don't like the patch. I said that you can commit it. I
agree in that it's more elegant. 

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll commit it, if it turns out that abcrem handles this case

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> P.S.: You really don't want to know how much time I need for writing 
</I>&gt;<i> emails like this.
