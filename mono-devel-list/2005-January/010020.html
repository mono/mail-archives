<PRE>I've got a linux box that runs mono, and most if not all apps I've
tried to run, ran well, without a hitch.

My question is I need to have potentially large file uploads occur etc.

My requirements are...

I'd prefer to stick to port 80, because its by far the most open port
(in regards to firewalls and such) but not hinder current web activity
etc.

My client machine thats going to be doing uploading isnt a browser, so
if I could get the backend running on linux+mono (and perhaps
xsp/mod_mono), I could chunk the files up on the client machine and
reassemble on server or something.

Its a strange sort of project, so I understand if nobody has done
anything quite like this before, but I was curious if anyone had
suggestions which direction to go.

I know as far as straight file uploads go, its kinda hit and miss
especially with large files.

Thanks in advance
Weston Weems
