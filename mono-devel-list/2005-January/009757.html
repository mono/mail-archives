<PRE>&gt;<i> Hi Ben,
</I>&gt;<i> thanks a lot for your really interesting and quick response.
</I>&gt;<i> The core of my thesis consists of extracting and analyzing process
</I>&gt;<i> information from Subversion repositories. I have defined several metrics
</I>&gt;<i> and I am trying to use them against Open Source projects hosted on
</I>&gt;<i> Subversion. The goal is to show that the enormous information available
</I>&gt;<i> in the repositories can be used for software engineering studies. For
</I>&gt;<i> example, it would be interesting to find how much Agile Metodologies are
</I>&gt;<i> in use in the Open Source community.
</I>
Very interesting.

&gt;<i> Apart to be an interesting result, this fact becomes strange when you
</I>&gt;<i> notice that we have (for miguel, for example):
</I>&gt;<i>  -  2 occourrencies of commits distant less than 1 second;
</I>&gt;<i>  -  1 occourrencies of commits whose distance is between 1 and 2 second;
</I>&gt;<i> -  2 occourrencies of commits whose distance is between 2 and 3 second;
</I>&gt;<i> -  3 occourrencies of commits whose distance is between 3 and 4 second;
</I>&gt;<i> - 57 occourrencies of commits whose distance is between 4 and 5 second;
</I>&gt;<i> - 15 occourrencies of commits whose distance is between 5 and 6 second;
</I>&gt;<i> - 13 occourrencies of commits whose distance is between 6 and 7 second;
</I>&gt;<i> the distribution then tends slowly to zero.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Essentially I need to understand how it is possible to have really close
</I>&gt;<i> commits.
</I>&gt;<i> Is there a tool that gives you the ability to prepare a serie of commits
</I>&gt;<i> (each one with his own message) and then run all the operations
</I>&gt;<i> automatically?
</I>Not really, it is usually just fast typing (miguel is an especially
special case, because he works in the Boston office, which is where our
server is. So, there is basically no network lag).

-- Ben
