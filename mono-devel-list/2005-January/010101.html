Hi,

this is really great news !

&gt;<i> Caveats
</I>&gt;<i> ---
</I>&gt;<i> * Debugging is only supported on Linux with kernel 2.6 or later since
</I>&gt;<i> Mono.Debugging supports only that environment (AFAICS).
</I>
That's correct (the only exception is the kernel from Red Hat 9).

&gt;<i> * I have only tested debugging with the Mono svn head sources.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * The Mono.Debugger assembly must be installed in the GAC.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Multithreading is not supported due to some problems with the
</I>&gt;<i> Mono.Debugger assembly.
</I>
What are these problems ?

&gt;<i> * There are some instabilities (breakpoints not being hit, processes
</I>&gt;<i> staying around, incorrect source positions displayed, incorrect stepping
</I>&gt;<i> behavior, exceptions, occasional debug output profanity ;-), etc...),
</I>&gt;<i> most of which are caused by bugs in the Mono.Debugger assembly.
</I>
I'm sure I can help here fixing these bugs.

&gt;<i> Future plans
</I>&gt;<i> ---
</I>&gt;<i> I am at the point where I can not improve the Mono debugger proxy
</I>&gt;<i> program without modifications to the Mono.Debugger assembly. I do not
</I>&gt;<i> want to develop/send patches just yet since the problems I am
</I>&gt;<i> experiencing with Mono.Debugger can not be fixed with small patches. If
</I>&gt;<i> the maintainer(s) of the Mono.Debugger assembly are interested I am
</I>&gt;<i> willing to discuss design issues and bugs in the Mono.Debugger API,
</I>&gt;<i> propose possible solutions and develop patches.
</I>
Well, some time ago I was thinking myself about some kind of a proxy
program for the debugger to communicate with MonoDevelop - it's really
cool to see that you've written one :-)

Sure we can make changes and fix problems in the debugger, let's just
discuss what you need.

Martin
