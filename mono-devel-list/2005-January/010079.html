<PRE>Hey,

&gt;<i> The major problem are:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         * &quot;Over protection&quot; for some resources (this isn't a security
</I>&gt;<i>         problem but may impact performance);
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>                 E.g. Microsoft's System.Reflection.StrongNameKeyPair
</I>&gt;<i>                 implementation requires UnmanagedCode permission (maybe
</I>&gt;<i>                 because it call an unmanaged API, maybe not...).
</I>&gt;<i>                 
</I>&gt;<i>                 Mono's implementation of StrongNameKeyPair is completely
</I>&gt;<i>                 managed and the class, by itself, doesn't do much. So we
</I>&gt;<i>                 could possibly (if the code using the class is properly
</I>&gt;<i>                 protected!) skip the check.
</I>
This is something that we encountered elsewhere: basically our
implementation would allow more things than the Microsoft runtime would
allow, and might give people a false sense of portability.

But this in particular seems to impact only a very small subset of users
(definitely none of those are using Mono today) that I think we might
want to do this as a `value add' of our implementation: remove the
check, as we do not have the unmanaged code requirement.
 
&gt;<i>         * &quot;Over protection&quot; can also be misleading as sometimes a
</I>&gt;<i>         permission is used because of it's end effect - not it's true
</I>&gt;<i>         meaning. A common pattern is to require UnmanagedCode because
</I>&gt;<i>         you only want highly trusted code to execute (yes there are
</I>&gt;<i>         better ways to do it).
</I>&gt;<i>                 
</I>&gt;<i>                 E.g. Environment.MachineName requires UnmanagedCode
</I>&gt;<i>                 permission, while other similar properties (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i>                 UserDomainName, UserName, ...) doesn't. 
</I>&gt;<i>                 
</I>&gt;<i>                 The UnmanagedCode requirement is documented (in this
</I>&gt;<i>                 case) but it doesn't tell why it is required!
</I>
This might be also a Microsoft limitation;  The question really is
whether we introduce a potential hole, and my feeling is not.

&gt;<i> However I really don't want to mix (source wise) the security test cases
</I>&gt;<i> with the current unit test case. This is mostly to allow easier tracking
</I>&gt;<i> and reviews in the future. So I propose that the new source tests files
</I>&gt;<i> ends with Cas.cs (or CasTest.cs if something depends on tests ending
</I>&gt;<i> with *Test.cs).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> E.g.	EnvironmentCas.cs	or
</I>&gt;<i> 	EnvironmentCasTest.cs
</I>
I agree, this sounds better.
