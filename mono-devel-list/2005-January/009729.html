Hello,

&gt;<i> DefineLocalVariable:

</I>&gt;<i> scopes. Could it be possible to pass a StartOffset/EndOffset (and with 
</I>&gt;<i> it an index) ?
</I>
Good point.  I guess you mean the following case:

	void Test (int a)
	{
		if (a &lt; 3) {
			long b = a * 8;
			Console.WriteLine (b);
		} else {
			long b = a * 4;
			Console.WriteLine (b);
		}
	}

I just tried this with mdb and what happens is that it shows two local
variables with the same name `b' (and it correctly gets their scope).  I
consider this an important bug and will try to fix it soon.

&gt;<i> MarkSequencePoint:
</I>&gt;<i> Some code within a method could be written in another file (for example 
</I>&gt;<i> include files), MarkSequencePoint doesn't seem to allow to say which 
</I>&gt;<i> file it was defined in, also how do I say where (and the debugger) it ends? There could be 
</I>&gt;<i> multiple statements on a line.
</I>
Well, at the moment, Mono's debugging API is only used for C# code and
there a method can't be in multiple files.  We could change that, of
course.

&gt;<i>From the debugger's point of view, a method is always in one single
</I>source file - if a part of a method is in an include file, the debugger
currently ignores that (as if there was no source code available for
it).  This could be changed at a later time.

MarkSequencePoint only marks the beginning of a statement.  A statement
ends where the next statement begins.  To mark the end of a statement,
just call MarkSequencePoint again with the end offset / line number.

Column numbers are currently ignored since MCS doesn't support column
numbers.  This is a long overdue wishlist item.

&gt;<i> OpenMethod:
</I>&gt;<i> Do the StartRow/StartColumn/EndRow/EndColumn do anything? Because for 
</I>&gt;<i> our compiler part of a method could be in another file/location (for 
</I>&gt;<i> example field initialization code within a constructor)
</I>
For which language is your compiler ?

The StartRow/EndRow specify the &quot;bounds&quot; of the method's source code,
ie. if the user tells the debugger &quot;show me the source code of method
Foo&quot;, it'll display row StartRow till row EndRow.

Field initialization within a constructor is a good point - I think what
we should do is add a file argument to MarkSequencePoint.  Then,
StartRow/EndRow would still be in the same file, but you could have some
lines from different files in the method.

&gt;<i> CreateOutput:
</I>&gt;<i> the GUID parameter, I'm not sure what this is, should this be the same 
</I>&gt;<i> as the Module guid?
</I>
Yes.

Lemme know if you have any more questions.

Martin
