Absolutely, patently untrue.

Many many patches are accepted everyday from various contributors.

Just because you are incapable of understanding the standardized method
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

There exist generally two paths.

1) File a bug in bugzilla, make sure the summary starts with [PATCH] and
attach your patch. Note. PATCH, not modified file, or code snippet, but
unified diff PATCH.
2) Email the list here, again with the Subject starting with [PATCH] and
attach your patch. Same note as to what a patch is from above applies
here as well.

Posting entire files, and rewritten methods to this list is a sure fire
way to get ignored.
