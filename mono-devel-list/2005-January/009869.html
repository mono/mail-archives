<PRE>Hello, I've recently discovered that when I am removing my web application
and uploading a brand new copy that it seems that I need to kill the process
to mod-mono-server before the new copy of the application will begin to
work.  It looks almost as if it gets hung up waiting for something to load.
I've only seen this happen a few times, no errors that I can see though.
Also is there a way to time out mod-mono-server.exe after X time of
inactivity?  Seems kind of silly for these processes to be running if there
inactive?  Also I've noticed my one ASP.NET/C# project, it has a 800px wide
header graphic, nothing fancy, but under IIS it loads fine, but under
apache/xsp/mod_mono it appears to only load the graphic every-other time,
even though the time when it appears broken, if you right click and look at
image source, the file and path exist and are correct, although I'm not
noticing the problem with my last upload, other people that I've had look at
it are saying they still see the problem.

 

Thanks in advance!
