This stuff needs to be documented and the way to do it is to
read the code, use grep and annotate it. Anyone can do it.
Would you like to contribute?
If you don't plan to contribute in the effort and just need a quick
help on a data structure in particular, just ask explicitly
what you need. Asking a list of all the shared data is not going to
get an answer, because this stuff isn't documented yet and doing so
_now_ is not scheduled for any of us: it takes time. You can help by taking
a data structure and documenting that for starters, if you want.
Plus, having more eyes on the code can only help find and fix the bugs
that lurk in there. Right now, if I had a document describing what is
shared and which locks protect what, I wouldn't tell you, because
that would prevent you from reading the code and telling us about the
bugs you found;-)
