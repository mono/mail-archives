<PRE>Hi Jambunathan,

First, I've missed you in the last weeks, I'm happy you came back.

Second, You've been reading my mind, don't you... I was thinking of
doing just that. Since Marco Ridoni made some huge contributions,
years ago, I could not keep mbas in sync with mcs, what I had done
after the fork for some months...

Well, mbas was forked so that mcs development would not be hampered,
but I still think they can share a lot of code. I would prefer that
logic to be shared as libraries but certainly Miguel prefers the
current 'single-piece' design for mcs, so maybe we could use them as
netmodules, or just shared source, for the time being.

Another possibilties I am studying: 
- using the boo compiler pipeline with a VB.NET parser.
- advance current mbas to a better stage, and then see what can be
refactored/componentized between it and mcs.

Anyway, I would love to see your bmcs code (BTW I would prefer a name
like mvb for such experiment).

Have you already tackled the case-insensitive-symbol-resolution issue?
It's surely something that should be componentized (made pluggable -
strategy design pattern) , as the parser/tokenizer currently are in
mbas.

Best wishes for you too,
--

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here are e a few strong reasons why I indulged in such an experiment:

</I>&gt;<i> Also two years is too much of a time that the code bases have diverged
</I>&gt;<i> significantly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I see, during the last two years, the VB.NET compiler code has

</I>&gt;<i> VB.NET specific semantics.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With the new approach 1) the effort spent on (1) gets reduced
</I>&gt;<i> significantly 2) The trees could be get in sync so that pulling in
</I>&gt;<i> partial classes or generics supoort in feature would be relatively a

</I>&gt;<i> that can be built to either C# compiler (mcs/gmcs) or VB.NET compiler
</I>&gt;<i> (bmcs). Or atleast it will show up avenues for building a reusable
</I>&gt;<i> code emission library from the current compiler for building new .NET
</I>&gt;<i> langauge compilers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would be spending some time pampering this new beast. It is going to
</I>&gt;<i> be essentially a night job and develop in bits and pieces.
</I>&gt;<i>
