<PRE>I suppose I should have made myself clearer.  I copied
Microsoft.Web.Services2.dll to my Linux machine and tried to run it on
mono with my application.  The application is very simple and only
derives from SoapService, and SoapClient.  No authentication or
encryption going on.

I was just wondering if there was a way to massage something to get
Microsoft's dll running on mono.

Subject: Re: [Mono-devel-list] Microsoft.Web.Services2 on Mono

Based on what I have heard and what I understand, the API is not
stable between anything other than service-pack versioning.

WSE is the test bed and toolkit for early adopters of web services
with various WS-* protocols. WSE 3 will probably have a closer API to
WSE 2 than 2 did to 1, just because the specifications themselves are
solidifying. But the stable API is meant to be Indigo - my
understanding is that no WSE major releases are planned after Indigo
v1.

Now with Indigo being unstable, WSE is a better target for providing
support for these web services adopters within the mono environment. I
am hopeful that a fair bit of logic within a WSE implementation would
be applicable to an Indigo/MessageBus implementation as well.
