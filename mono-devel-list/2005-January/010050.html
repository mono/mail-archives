<PRE>Hi Every1,

  I have a Web Service which calls several Sql Server stored
  procedures. After deploying this service to a linux box that runs
  apache and mono I've realized that the service ran much much slower
  on this machine than it did before on a windows machine with IIS and
  .NET. My investigations showed that the following lines could be
  blamed for this performance issue:

         DataSet ds = new DataSet();
         ds.Locale = CultureInfo.CurrentCulture;

         SqlDataAdapter adapter = new SqlDataAdapter( this.Command );
         adapter.Fill( ds );

  As you may know I use this code to execute a stored procedure. I
  tryed to call several SPs, but all of them were very slow so I guess
  the problem is mono related. Very slow means that on Windows the
  following lines are executed in less than some milliseconds on Linux
  they take at least ten seconds (!!!).

  And I forgot to tell you that I use the
  same SQL server (same connection string) both from Linux and
  Windows, that's why I suspect that the this problem is caused by mono.

  Is there any explanation for this performance loss?

Thanks in advance!
Peter Neumann
