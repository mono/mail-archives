I don't mean to be rude, but this question suggests that you need to
read an introduction to multi-threaded programming.  It doesn't have to
be a .net-specific text, but &quot;.NET Multithreading&quot; by Alan L. Dennis
(ISBN 1-930110-54-5) is recommended on our web site.

&gt;<i>   Which functions are called by multiple threads and which ones are called  
</I>&gt;<i>   only by the starting thread --&gt; to see which ones need synchronization  
</I>&gt;<i>   --&gt; or is synchronization only done by synchronizing the access to  
</I>&gt;<i>   shared data structures. Which datastructures are shared?  
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;<i>   Is there any documentation about it?   
</I>
And this one just needs you to read through the code.
