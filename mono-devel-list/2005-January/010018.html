<PRE>Hi,

I'd like to report a bug that occurs with XSP and Internet Explorer.

What is the bug?
The server answers &quot;SERVER ERROR: Your client sent a request that was not
understood by this server&quot;

When does it happen?
It never occurs with XSP 1.0.1.0. and whatever browsers.
It never occurs with XSP 1.0.5.0. and FireFox or Mozilla
It occurs with XSP 1.0.5.0. and Internet Explorer

How often?
The error occures when it's an important request (many data) or when 
there are many
requests in a short time. That lets me think that the problem is caused 
by a too big flow
of data coming from Internet Explorer to XSP.

I also used Ethereal to capture communication (TCP/HTTP) between IE and XSP.
I made one capture without the error and another with the error (by 
sending several
times the same request in short time). Then I compared and realized 
there were almost
the same. That confirms what I suggest before.

Anyone knows how to fix the bug? I'll make a bug report on bugzilla on 
request...
