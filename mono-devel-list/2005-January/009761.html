Hi all,
I'm working on bug 71062, and as I am at it I wanted to make abcrem
safe against over/under-flow of integer values.

To see what I mean, look at the attached program, and execute it
with and without the -O=abcrem flag.
You'll note that the program behavior is different :-(

Please do not point that the program is lame, and that just testing
if an unsigned int is &gt;=0 is *asking* for an exception... I know,
this is a test program, and the test fails.

Short explanation: abcrem is convinced of two facts:
- In all &quot;signed&quot; tests, the index *always* grows.
- In all &quot;unsigned&quot; tests, the index *always* decreases.
abcrem guesses this looking at the operations performed on the
index variable: in the 1st case, only an addition of a positive
constant, and in the 2nd case the opposite (well, abcrem is much
more complex than that, but you get the idea).

What really happens is that, due to over/under-flow, the actual
index value has a different behavior.

Now the abcrem code (in my tree) has knowledge of all the sizes
and &quot;nature&quot; (signed/unsigned) of all local variables, and I
wanted to use this knowledge to solve the problem.

&gt;<i>From now, I'll call &quot;+k&quot; a sum with a positive constant or a
</I>difference with a negative constant, and &quot;-k&quot; the reverse.
The idea is that abcrem should only handle operations that are
&quot;safe&quot;in the sense that they do not produce over/under-flow.
By &quot;handle&quot; I mean &quot;try to guess the effect, and use it when
deciding to remove a check&quot;.

I would do the following:
- For signed values, handle both +k and -k operations, but only
  if k is &quot;small&quot;. See later for the definition of &quot;small&quot;.
- For unsigned values, handle only +k operations (the idea is
  that a +k operation cannot harm, because we know the index is
  growing, while a -k operation can *always* reach 0 and go the
  other way round, undetected, no matter how k is small).

The problem is, what does &quot;small&quot; mean?

For integers of size 1 or 2 bytes, IMO small means &quot;1&quot;.
This because abcrem removes the check if and only if there is
already a branch that checks that the index does not pass the
array length. If we go on with increments of &quot;1&quot;, we can be
(reasonably?) sure that we will be stopped by that branch before
the index becomes negative.

If, on the other hand, the index is a proper int, it is much
harder to make it overflow (in my test program I had to use a
very large constant).
In general, the constant must be &quot;&gt; (MAX_INT - length)&quot; for an
overflow to be possible.
Which value would you find reasonable to use in this case as a
&quot;guard&quot; (so that if k &lt; value, the operation is handled)?
I wanted to stay with a very low one (like 4).

Comments appreciated...

Ciao,
  Massi
