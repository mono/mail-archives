This code used to be synchronous (see SVN history) and had to be changed
to make it work correctly in every case.

Wrong. The handshake must be done async if the read/write that initiates
an handshake is async. Believe me, we tried, for a long time, in
Mono.Security ;-)

Anyway I don't see how you come to the conclusion that SslStream use a
synchronous method for doing it's handshake. Does your code works around
the 2.0 API ?

&gt;<i> I understand Mono version of this class will be implemented on the basis of 
</I>&gt;<i> the Mono.Security.
</I>
&quot;basis&quot; is well said. It will be based on Mono.Security, but it's still
undecided if this is gonna be a total rewrite (which would requires lot
of time and tests) or a thin wrapper around existing code (easier but we
still have the same issues, like high amount of memory allocations).

A few people have attempted both approach but never complete the task.

&gt;<i> 2) Implement IAsyncResult interface in such a way that it will be possible

</I>&gt;<i> the extension of the MemoryStream class.
</I>
That's probably much easier and has a lower chance of affecting the
current users of the SSL/TLS code.

&gt;<i> In any case the good knowledge of Mono.Security internals is required. So
