<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> True, but we also need to suport ~/App_Browsers, and that requires us
</I>&gt;<i> to implement the support for the .browser format anyway. But I agree
</I>&gt;<i> that using whatever we have today internally is perfectly fine
</I>&gt;<i> (especially with resources like
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://browsers.garykeith.com/downloads.asp">http://browsers.garykeith.com/downloads.asp</A> where the files are kept
</I>&gt;<i> fairly up to date).
</I>
I agree, but considering that:

	* It would be slow and more bloated.
	* That a simpler solution exists.
	* That there are bigger fish to fry than adding support for
	  corner case browsers that are not captured by our file.

I would suggest that this is of a very very very tiny priority.   And
even if we were to implement this, I would turn it off by default, so it
would effectively not be used.

&gt;<i> True. I've just thought about yet another optimization. What if we
</I>&gt;<i> shipped a file (for internal use only) that contained full collection of
</I>&gt;<i> UAs paired with their hash and the serialized browser caps objects? We
</I>&gt;<i> could then load the file to prime the UA cache I talked about and use
</I>&gt;<i> hash values to look for matches. Any new UAs, not found in our cache,
</I>&gt;<i> would of course be treated the &quot;long way&quot; first. What do you think?
</I>
Am not sure how you could have hashes considering that its a trivial
regular expression.

</PRE>
