<PRE>Hi Charlie,

Like you I am more familiar with Windows, but it appears to me that many of
the virtual folders on Windows have analogues in the *nix world. For
example, looking at Nautilus on my Ubuntu system, there is a Computer and a
Desktop entry.

As for the usefulness of the library, I cannot say: as I understand it,
there seemed to be from the moma results a need to access the WIndows Shell.
Providing a manner to do this in a cross-platform manner would certainly
make porting to non-Windows system easier. The question is whether there are
already ways to access the needed functionality in Mono, using
Icon.ExtractAssociatedIcon etc.

It would be useful to hear from the people who are using the Windows Shell
API under .NET to find out what they are using it for; it could be that this
library is overkill.

Cheers
Steve
