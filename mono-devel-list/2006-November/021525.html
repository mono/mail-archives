<PRE>Hi all,

I just had the opportunity to take a look at Eclipse CDT: an extension to 
develop C/C++ code... Well, it looks really great, and it has an integrated 
Debugger that makes it a real solution for Linux systems. In fact I've just 
seen it running under Ubuntu and goes great... (well, it was an small 
project btw, I wonder whether it would work with a bigger one).

I'm aware of the great job Lluis is doing with Monodevelop but, wouldn't it 
be a good idea to have an extension for Eclipse? Wouldn't it be great for 
Mono being able to be an alternative platform for a very well known IDE??

Taking into account the importance Eclipse is getting as an alternative IDE 
to VStudio/Microsoft... I think it is worth a look...

BTW (always the same question... :-P), how is the debugger going?

pablo
