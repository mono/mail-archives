<PRE>Hello everyone,

As part of our ongoing effort to make Mono's log profiler useful for
more scenarios, I'm planning to make it possible to interact with the
profiler at runtime - you can enable, disable, and tweak specific
profiler features in certain sections of your application, so you get
exactly the data that you're interested in. In order to do this, the
log profiler needs to be able to change its event flags and installed
callbacks dynamically at runtime.

# The Problem

It is currently impossible for any profiler to reliably change its
setup at runtime because Mono's profiler API (metadata/profiler.h)
only allows modifying the most recently installed profiler. Mono
supports having multiple profilers active at the same time, and we do
in fact use this feature in the Xamarin platform products. There's no
way around it: We need to rethink the profiler API. All functions must
take an explicit MonoProfiler* parameter.

This isn't the only problem with the current API.

Another issue is that multiple callbacks are installed through the
same function. For example, mono_profiler_install_exception installs
callbacks for thrown exceptions, exceptional method exits, and
exception clauses. When I had to add an extra parameter to the
exception clause callback recently, I introduced
mono_profiler_install_exception_clause for version 2 of that callback.
This means that new code will pass NULL to the third parameter of
mono_profiler_install_exception from now on. This just adds confusion.
It would be much clearer if the old function had been called
mono_profiler_install_exception_clause and I'd just been able to
introduce a mono_profiler_install_exception_v2 function. New users of
the API will likely wonder why mono_profiler_install_exception_clause
isn't part of mono_profiler_install_exception since the API has a
precedent of bundling related callbacks into the same installation
function.

There are also multiple callbacks in the API that aren't guarded by
event flags. For example, the code buffer callbacks should logically
be guarded by MONO_PROFILE_JIT_COMPILATION, but that's a change we
can't make now as it would be breaking. Another curiosity is that the
GC handle callbacks are guarded by MONO_PROFILE_GC_ROOTS even though
it's entirely likely that someone would be interested in GC handles
but not GC roots (see: Alan McGovern's GC handle profiler). It's also
odd that the exceptional method exit callback is guarded by
MONO_PROFILE_EXCEPTIONS when in fact most uses of this callback have
little to do with profiling exceptions and everything to do with
keeping track of method entries/exits as with the normal method
enter/exit callbacks (which are guarded by MONO_PROFILE_ENTER_LEAVE).

We also have callbacks that serve no actual purpose, and never will.
For example, the notion of a 'class unload' does not exist in the Mono
runtime. Never has, probably never will. Entire images are unloaded at
once, so this callback is literally never invoked. I'd actually say
having that callback there adds negative value to the API. The
managed/native transition callback was never implemented, either.

Finally, some features in the API have not been maintained or tested
for years. The call chain sampling API is a great example of this.
Another example: Did you know that the profiler API supports two
coverage modes which are mutually exclusive? You might think that
MONO_PROFILE_COVERAGE is the flag that you're supposed to be using.
Nope; it's MONO_PROFILE_INS_COVERAGE. The former is implemented in a
very platform-specific manner that has resulted in it not being
maintained, tested, or ported fully to new platforms.

In short, the current profiler API is pretty bad. We need a new API.
Of course, the elephant in the room is backwards compatibility. The
question is: Do we introduce a new profiler API and make the old one
'simply' call the new one? Or do we just replace the old API entirely,
backwards compatibility be damned?

# The New Profiler API

The new API would not be all that different from the old one. The main
changes would be:

1. All functions in the API take an explicit MonoProfiler* parameter.
2. Callbacks can be changed safely at runtime.
3. One installation function installs exactly one callback.
4. You will no longer need to specify event flags.
5. Unmaintained and unfinished features (see above) will be removed.

As an example, old code might look like this:

void
mono_profiler_startup (const char *args)
{
    MonoProfiler *prof = malloc (...);
    profiler_specific_setup (prof);
    mono_profiler_install (prof, my_shutdown_callback);
    mono_profiler_install_enter_leave (my_enter_callback, my_leave_callback);
    mono_profiler_set_events (MONO_PROFILE_ENTER_LEAVE);
}

New code would look like this:

void
mono_profiler_startup (const char *args)
{
    MonoProfiler *prof = malloc (...);
    profiler_specific_setup (prof);
    mono_profiler_install (prof);
    mono_profiler_set_shutdown_callback (prof, my_shutdown_callback);
    mono_profiler_set_enter_callback (prof, my_enter_callback);
    mono_profiler_set_leave_callback (prof, my_leave_callback);
}

We would still use flags internally so we don't slow the runtime down
with unnecessary profiler API calls, but that will be completely
hidden from users. All a user would have to worry about is (un)setting
callbacks, which can be done at any point during an app's lifetime.

Transitioning to the new API should be fairly painless. I'd estimate
it to take an hour or two at worst for e.g. the log profiler.

# Approach One: Backwards Compatibility

In this approach, we would introduce a new metadata/profiler-v2.h
header. This header would provide the new API and have no dependencies
on the old one. The old API would remain in metadata/profiler.h and
people's code would continue to compile and work. We would need to
bridge the old API to the new one and make sure that it's done in a
backwards-compatible way.

The advantage here is fairly obvious: Nobody likes having to rewrite
their code because the authors of a library decided to change the API,
especially if that change doesn't carry an obvious benefit to users,
which it could be argued this change wouldn't for most (all?) current
users of Mono's profiler API.

On the other hand, this is a significant maintenance burden, both in
the short and long term. Writing the code to bridge the nonsensical
aspects of the old API with the new one would be tricky to say the
least. In addition, there's the risk that any change to the new API in
the future could break the old API.

# Approach Two: Replacing the API

In this approach, we replace the old API in metadata/profiler.h with
the new one, with zero regard for backwards compatibility. People's
code would fail to compile, and old compiled profiler modules would
fail to run. In both cases, the failures should be fairly loud - a
compiler error, or a dynamic linker error.

The advantage of this approach is that it's significantly less effort
to implement and maintain. It also avoids any potential confusion for
new users of the API, in that there's only one set of functions to
use.

If we go down this route, all projects that use Mono's profiler API
would need to change their code slightly, and people would need to
compile separate versions of their profiler modules if they want to
support older Mono versions.

# My Opinion

I'm strongly in favor of the second approach. Frankly, as the person
who'll be implementing and maintaining the new API, I don't
particularly enjoy the idea of having to also maintain the old one in
a backwards compatible fashion. I think there are much better things I
could be working on in Mono's profiling infrastructure.

I also firmly believe that this is the only time we'll have to do such
a drastic breaking change to the profiler API. This isn't a proposal
to jump on some fancy new API design fad. Using a mutable global
variable as an implicit parameter to an entire API was pretty bad
design, even by 2002 standards. Just by passing an explicit
MonoProfiler* argument to all API functions, we open ourselves up to
much easier, backwards-compatible expansion of the API in the future.

Finally, as I mentioned earlier, transitioning to the new API would be
very easy, and users would have to do it sooner or later anyway, as we
wouldn't want to keep the old API around forever, even in the first
approach. Also, in the grand scheme of things, this probably won't
affect that many people, unlike breaking changes to the core embedding
API.

What's everyone's thoughts on this?

Regards,
Alex
