<PRE>So the possible issue with option #2 that I see is in distribution for
3rd party profilers like privateeye. I don't see this as a huge issue
but it might be useful to at least be able to load the old API still
(not work) so the old version of the profiler could realize it is on a
newer version and exit (or the runtime could recognize this and give a
reasonable error message.

Also a wonderful feature would be the ability to dynamically hook

mono_profiler_install_enter_leave (pe_method_enter, pe_method_leave);

As it is quite expensive. I imagine though this would be non-trivial.

&gt;<i> Hello everyone,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As part of our ongoing effort to make Mono's log profiler useful for
</I>&gt;<i> more scenarios, I'm planning to make it possible to interact with the
</I>&gt;<i> profiler at runtime - you can enable, disable, and tweak specific
</I>&gt;<i> profiler features in certain sections of your application, so you get
</I>&gt;<i> exactly the data that you're interested in. In order to do this, the
</I>&gt;<i> log profiler needs to be able to change its event flags and installed
</I>&gt;<i> callbacks dynamically at runtime.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # The Problem
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is currently impossible for any profiler to reliably change its
</I>&gt;<i> setup at runtime because Mono's profiler API (metadata/profiler.h)
</I>&gt;<i> only allows modifying the most recently installed profiler. Mono
</I>&gt;<i> supports having multiple profilers active at the same time, and we do
</I>&gt;<i> in fact use this feature in the Xamarin platform products. There's no
</I>&gt;<i> way around it: We need to rethink the profiler API. All functions must
</I>&gt;<i> take an explicit MonoProfiler* parameter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This isn't the only problem with the current API.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another issue is that multiple callbacks are installed through the
</I>&gt;<i> same function. For example, mono_profiler_install_exception installs
</I>&gt;<i> callbacks for thrown exceptions, exceptional method exits, and
</I>&gt;<i> exception clauses. When I had to add an extra parameter to the
</I>&gt;<i> exception clause callback recently, I introduced
</I>&gt;<i> mono_profiler_install_exception_clause for version 2 of that callback.
</I>&gt;<i> This means that new code will pass NULL to the third parameter of
</I>&gt;<i> mono_profiler_install_exception from now on. This just adds confusion.
</I>&gt;<i> It would be much clearer if the old function had been called
</I>&gt;<i> mono_profiler_install_exception_clause and I'd just been able to
</I>&gt;<i> introduce a mono_profiler_install_exception_v2 function. New users of
</I>&gt;<i> the API will likely wonder why mono_profiler_install_exception_clause
</I>&gt;<i> isn't part of mono_profiler_install_exception since the API has a
</I>&gt;<i> precedent of bundling related callbacks into the same installation
</I>&gt;<i> function.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are also multiple callbacks in the API that aren't guarded by
</I>&gt;<i> event flags. For example, the code buffer callbacks should logically
</I>&gt;<i> be guarded by MONO_PROFILE_JIT_COMPILATION, but that's a change we
</I>&gt;<i> can't make now as it would be breaking. Another curiosity is that the
</I>&gt;<i> GC handle callbacks are guarded by MONO_PROFILE_GC_ROOTS even though
</I>&gt;<i> it's entirely likely that someone would be interested in GC handles
</I>&gt;<i> but not GC roots (see: Alan McGovern's GC handle profiler). It's also
</I>&gt;<i> odd that the exceptional method exit callback is guarded by
</I>&gt;<i> MONO_PROFILE_EXCEPTIONS when in fact most uses of this callback have
</I>&gt;<i> little to do with profiling exceptions and everything to do with
</I>&gt;<i> keeping track of method entries/exits as with the normal method
</I>&gt;<i> enter/exit callbacks (which are guarded by MONO_PROFILE_ENTER_LEAVE).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We also have callbacks that serve no actual purpose, and never will.
</I>&gt;<i> For example, the notion of a 'class unload' does not exist in the Mono
</I>&gt;<i> runtime. Never has, probably never will. Entire images are unloaded at
</I>&gt;<i> once, so this callback is literally never invoked. I'd actually say
</I>&gt;<i> having that callback there adds negative value to the API. The
</I>&gt;<i> managed/native transition callback was never implemented, either.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, some features in the API have not been maintained or tested
</I>&gt;<i> for years. The call chain sampling API is a great example of this.
</I>&gt;<i> Another example: Did you know that the profiler API supports two
</I>&gt;<i> coverage modes which are mutually exclusive? You might think that
</I>&gt;<i> MONO_PROFILE_COVERAGE is the flag that you're supposed to be using.
</I>&gt;<i> Nope; it's MONO_PROFILE_INS_COVERAGE. The former is implemented in a
</I>&gt;<i> very platform-specific manner that has resulted in it not being
</I>&gt;<i> maintained, tested, or ported fully to new platforms.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In short, the current profiler API is pretty bad. We need a new API.
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, the elephant in the room is backwards compatibility. The
</I>&gt;<i> question is: Do we introduce a new profiler API and make the old one
</I>&gt;<i> 'simply' call the new one? Or do we just replace the old API entirely,
</I>&gt;<i> backwards compatibility be damned?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # The New Profiler API
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The new API would not be all that different from the old one. The main
</I>&gt;<i> changes would be:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. All functions in the API take an explicit MonoProfiler* parameter.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Callbacks can be changed safely at runtime.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. One installation function installs exactly one callback.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. You will no longer need to specify event flags.
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Unmaintained and unfinished features (see above) will be removed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As an example, old code might look like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> void
</I>&gt;<i> mono_profiler_startup (const char *args)
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i>     MonoProfiler *prof = malloc (...);
</I>&gt;<i>     profiler_specific_setup (prof);
</I>&gt;<i>     mono_profiler_install (prof, my_shutdown_callback);
</I>&gt;<i>     mono_profiler_install_enter_leave (my_enter_callback, my_leave_callback);
</I>&gt;<i>     mono_profiler_set_events (MONO_PROFILE_ENTER_LEAVE);
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> New code would look like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> void
</I>&gt;<i> mono_profiler_startup (const char *args)
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i>     MonoProfiler *prof = malloc (...);
</I>&gt;<i>     profiler_specific_setup (prof);
</I>&gt;<i>     mono_profiler_install (prof);
</I>&gt;<i>     mono_profiler_set_shutdown_callback (prof, my_shutdown_callback);
</I>&gt;<i>     mono_profiler_set_enter_callback (prof, my_enter_callback);
</I>&gt;<i>     mono_profiler_set_leave_callback (prof, my_leave_callback);
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We would still use flags internally so we don't slow the runtime down
</I>&gt;<i> with unnecessary profiler API calls, but that will be completely
</I>&gt;<i> hidden from users. All a user would have to worry about is (un)setting
</I>&gt;<i> callbacks, which can be done at any point during an app's lifetime.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Transitioning to the new API should be fairly painless. I'd estimate
</I>&gt;<i> it to take an hour or two at worst for e.g. the log profiler.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # Approach One: Backwards Compatibility
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In this approach, we would introduce a new metadata/profiler-v2.h
</I>&gt;<i> header. This header would provide the new API and have no dependencies
</I>&gt;<i> on the old one. The old API would remain in metadata/profiler.h and
</I>&gt;<i> people's code would continue to compile and work. We would need to
</I>&gt;<i> bridge the old API to the new one and make sure that it's done in a
</I>&gt;<i> backwards-compatible way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The advantage here is fairly obvious: Nobody likes having to rewrite
</I>&gt;<i> their code because the authors of a library decided to change the API,
</I>&gt;<i> especially if that change doesn't carry an obvious benefit to users,
</I>&gt;<i> which it could be argued this change wouldn't for most (all?) current
</I>&gt;<i> users of Mono's profiler API.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, this is a significant maintenance burden, both in
</I>&gt;<i> the short and long term. Writing the code to bridge the nonsensical
</I>&gt;<i> aspects of the old API with the new one would be tricky to say the
</I>&gt;<i> least. In addition, there's the risk that any change to the new API in
</I>&gt;<i> the future could break the old API.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # Approach Two: Replacing the API
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In this approach, we replace the old API in metadata/profiler.h with
</I>&gt;<i> the new one, with zero regard for backwards compatibility. People's
</I>&gt;<i> code would fail to compile, and old compiled profiler modules would
</I>&gt;<i> fail to run. In both cases, the failures should be fairly loud - a
</I>&gt;<i> compiler error, or a dynamic linker error.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The advantage of this approach is that it's significantly less effort
</I>&gt;<i> to implement and maintain. It also avoids any potential confusion for
</I>&gt;<i> new users of the API, in that there's only one set of functions to
</I>&gt;<i> use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we go down this route, all projects that use Mono's profiler API
</I>&gt;<i> would need to change their code slightly, and people would need to
</I>&gt;<i> compile separate versions of their profiler modules if they want to
</I>&gt;<i> support older Mono versions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # My Opinion
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm strongly in favor of the second approach. Frankly, as the person
</I>&gt;<i> who'll be implementing and maintaining the new API, I don't
</I>&gt;<i> particularly enjoy the idea of having to also maintain the old one in
</I>&gt;<i> a backwards compatible fashion. I think there are much better things I
</I>&gt;<i> could be working on in Mono's profiling infrastructure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also firmly believe that this is the only time we'll have to do such
</I>&gt;<i> a drastic breaking change to the profiler API. This isn't a proposal
</I>&gt;<i> to jump on some fancy new API design fad. Using a mutable global
</I>&gt;<i> variable as an implicit parameter to an entire API was pretty bad
</I>&gt;<i> design, even by 2002 standards. Just by passing an explicit
</I>&gt;<i> MonoProfiler* argument to all API functions, we open ourselves up to
</I>&gt;<i> much easier, backwards-compatible expansion of the API in the future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, as I mentioned earlier, transitioning to the new API would be
</I>&gt;<i> very easy, and users would have to do it sooner or later anyway, as we
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't want to keep the old API around forever, even in the first
</I>&gt;<i> approach. Also, in the grand scheme of things, this probably won't
</I>&gt;<i> affect that many people, unlike breaking changes to the core embedding
</I>&gt;<i> API.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What's everyone's thoughts on this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Alex
