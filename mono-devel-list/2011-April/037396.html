</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok thank you. For some strage reason mcs doe not build when I use
</I>build-mingw32.sh, although it is enabled.
Anyway I tried to build using &quot;make EXTERNAL_MCS= ... EXTERNAL_RUNTIME=... &quot;
(refering to a copied Mono-2.10.1 install) which ended up with errors like:
MCS [basic] mscorlib.dll source file $PATH_MSYS/noconfig could not be found.
I think it's related to the misinterpretation of /options by MSys which
expects -options.
I tried to change all occurences onf such commands but might screwed it up
somewhere along the way.
The error is now:
MCS [basic] mscorlib.dll
Assembly\AssemblyInfo.cs(54,12) error CS8088: Your .Net Runtime does not
support 'AssemblyVersionAttribute'. Please use the latest runtime instead.
.....
and (translated from the german output)
Unhandled Exception: System.ArgumentException: The constant does not match
the defined type.
in System.Reflection.Emit.TypeBuilder.SetConstantValue(Module module,Int32
... )
...
in System.CSharp.Driver.Main(String[] args)

If this is not a known error pattern please do not dig too much into it. It
might be very well my own fault.
However, I'm asking myself whether or not I could try to go with the mcs as
it is distributed for windows.
A very small &quot;Hello world&quot; test showed that my compiled mono seems be able
to run assemblies from the distribution, including dmcs.exe. Is this
worthwhile or is it doomed to fail?
