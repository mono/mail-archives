<PRE>Hi,

One suggestion: I would strongly advise using either jay (what Mono
uses for mcs) which is LALR or Coco/R (<A HREF="http://ssw.jku.at/Coco/">http://ssw.jku.at/Coco/</A>) which
is LL(1) for the parsing. These are pure .NET tools, so you won't have
to use Java or similar (as is the case with ANTLR).

Regards,
Alex

&gt;<i> I have published the updated proposal here : <A HREF="https://gist.github.com/905344">https://gist.github.com/905344</A> .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ==========================================================
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's my the draft of GSoC Proposal for FreshBuild.
</I>&gt;<i> I'd welcome any feedbacks and anyone who would like to be my mentor.
</I>&gt;<i> And I need a more impressive name for this ambitious project.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> FreshBuild : Add MSVC and GCC Supprot to XBuild/MSBuild and Translate
</I>&gt;<i> Makefiles to MSBuild project Files

</I>&gt;<i> IRC: Sharp
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # Abstract:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;This project is to improve the XBuild so as to provide MSVC and
</I>&gt;<i> GCC support and translate makefiles to MSBuild project files.It is
</I>&gt;<i> intended to simplify the building process and cut down building
</I>&gt;<i> problem on both the Windows and Linux platforms.Also,many opensource
</I>&gt;<i> projects would benefit from the MSVC compiler in performance, which
</I>&gt;<i> can usually produce faster bytecode than GCC.FreshBuild is based on
</I>&gt;<i> XBuild and would eventually merged back into it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # Benefits:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;Building is not easy.Many opensource softwares are based on the
</I>&gt;<i> GNU tool chain,which use makefiles as their build scripts. To build
</I>&gt;<i> those softwares on Windows,you have to install Cygwin to use GCC and
</I>&gt;<i> Make,even though the MSVC compiler is available.And to use GNU
</I>&gt;<i> Make,you have to &#160;write makefiles.While Java and .Net developers would
</I>&gt;<i> prefer to some easy to use ,more advanced and XML based build systems,
</I>&gt;<i> such as Ant,Maven and MSBuild, which is a lot more friendly to us.In
</I>&gt;<i> my own experience, I often get mad when I am required to install GCC
</I>&gt;<i> and a lot of other compile tools while installing a small Ruby gem in
</I>&gt;<i> Windows.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;Mono is made up of C and C# source code ,and ,just like many other
</I>&gt;<i> opensource projects, it currently use GNU Make to build
</I>&gt;<i> itself,including compiling,generating docs and running unit tests.It
</I>&gt;<i> also provides XBuild,the counterpart of MSBuild,to build C# projects.
</I>&gt;<i> However ,it has fallen behind since the MSBuild 4 has been updated to
</I>&gt;<i> support VC++ compiler,which unified the building process on windows
</I>&gt;<i> platform.This project would help Mono to build itself with XBuild on
</I>&gt;<i> both Windows and Linux.So you do not have to worry about Cygwin when
</I>&gt;<i> you are in Windows.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;To migrate the GNU Make based projects ,I really hope to develop a
</I>&gt;<i> makefile to MSBuild project file translator ,which would help me to
</I>&gt;<i> get rid of those makefiles.I have been planning this for
</I>&gt;<i> years,especially every time building problem occurs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # Deliverables:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;1.A MSBuild extension to support MSVC on windows,which is the same
</I>&gt;<i> as the official one .
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;2.A MSBuild extension to support GCC on both Windows and Linux
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;3.A makefile translator.
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;4.A visualizing tool to edit MSBuild project files (which is less important)
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;5.A build server for FreshBuild &#160;(which is also less important)
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;6.Some docs ,some examples and a test suite.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;For such a project,I don't have to worry about tests.So I would
</I>&gt;<i> take compiling the ruby installer as my goal.I shall translate its
</I>&gt;<i> makefiles and compile it with MSVC in the end.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # Project Details:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;Some Backgrounds:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;MSBuild is an Ant-like build system for Visual Studio,which
</I>&gt;<i> supports VB and C# and is very extendible.Ever since VS2010 and
</I>&gt;<i> MSBuild 4,it supports C++ projects.XBuild is the opensource edition of
</I>&gt;<i> MSBuild.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;-- I would start from XBuild,add MSVC and GCC support to it and
</I>&gt;<i> implement some missing features if necessary.It is not difficult,but
</I>&gt;<i> it needs a lot of tests.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;-- I would also provide a MSBuild project file editor and a build
</I>&gt;<i> server if possible.It may be developed in WinForms,
</I>&gt;<i> Silverlight/Moonlight or HTML.If time is not enough,I would cancel
</I>&gt;<i> this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;-- As to the makefile translator,It is a challenge for
</I>&gt;<i> me.However,Microsoft also provided a NMake(the previous MSVC build
</I>&gt;<i> tool) file to MSBuild project file converter. Since the capacity of
</I>&gt;<i> MSBuild is a superset of GNU Make and it's so easy to extend ,it is
</I>&gt;<i> possible to develop such a translator.I 'll write a makefile parser
</I>&gt;<i> ,analyze the makefile structure ,do some replacement,and then generate
</I>&gt;<i> the XML form build scripts.I have some experience in developing a
</I>&gt;<i> compiler with Antlr,it would help.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; -- All code will be hosted on a GitHub repository. Once the project
</I>&gt;<i> is finished, it will be merged back into XBuild.It would be writen in
</I>&gt;<i> C#.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; -- MSDN would be the best document for this project, so my document
</I>&gt;<i> would focus on the Linux cases. I would also provide some GCC samples.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; -- As I mentioned before, the final goal of this project would be
</I>&gt;<i> compiling the Windows Ruby installer with MSVC.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; -- The development process is divided into multiple stages and
</I>&gt;<i> during each stage it is mostly iterative and test-driven .I will
</I>&gt;<i> firstly do some experiments,read the manual ,make up the test suit and
</I>&gt;<i> then try to pass it.At last I would fix the remaining bugs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # Project Schedule:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;I wouldn't wait for the summer vocation to start the
</I>&gt;<i> development,though I would be less active before it.And during the
</I>&gt;<i> development process, I am eager to communicate with my community
</I>&gt;<i> users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;My schedule is made up of 14 weeks,started soon after from April 8,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;Week 1 : Learn about the usage of MSBuild,go through the source of
</I>&gt;<i> XBuild and try to do extend it.Considering I have some experience
</I>&gt;<i> using and extending the MSBuild ,it wouldn't be a matter for me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;Week 2-3 : Create sample VC++ projects for tests,and start to
</I>&gt;<i> develop the MSVC extension for XBuild.I just need to follow the
</I>&gt;<i> MSBuild api in MSDN ,still ,it would not be a matter to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;Week 4-6 : Create sample GCC projects from the &#160;VC++ projects,dive
</I>&gt;<i> into the GCC Manual and try to compile some softwares by Cygwin.I have
</I>&gt;<i> to do a lot of reading,so it would cost two weeks.And then I will
</I>&gt;<i> spend one week to develop the GCC extension .And I would also try GNU
</I>&gt;<i> Make.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;Week 7 : Study the GNU Make grammar and read through its
</I>&gt;<i> manual.Also I should do some experiments on it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;Week 8-11 : Start writing the translator.I would write a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> unit tests and develop the parser with Antlr.And I need to solve a lot
</I>&gt;<i> of problems.Also,I need to try it on Linux.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;Week 12-13 : Develop the MSBuild Project file editor and build
</I>&gt;<i> server.If necessary ,I would also need to fix some bugs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;Week 14 : Hunt bugs and get feedback from community users.

</I>&gt;<i> # Bio:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;I am a junior student in the South China University of
</I>&gt;<i> Technology.This is my first Google Summer of Code Project. I learnt
</I>&gt;<i> computer programming (in Delphi) since my junior high school time.I
</I>&gt;<i> have a lot of experience in C#,Java,PHP and Ruby.I have great interest
</I>&gt;<i> in developing advanced compilers and high performance servers.I've
</I>&gt;<i> wrote a Javafx-like language grammar and a matlab language grammar
</I>&gt;<i> with antlr.I like opensource softwares ,but sometimes have problem in
</I>&gt;<i> compiling,installing and fixing dependencies,which costs me a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> effort and makes me angry.So I came up with this project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # Eligibility:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;In many ways,I am an eligible student.I can provide identification
</I>&gt;<i> if required.
