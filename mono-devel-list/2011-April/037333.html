<PRE>Hi,

Proposal looks good to me. Generally, mentors are selected after you
submit your proposal, so I suggest just going ahead and submitting
this to GSoC!

On a side-note, Mono is actually written in C, not C++. I don't know
if there's any C++ code anywhere, though.

Regards,
Alex

&gt;<i> Here's my the draft of GSoC Proposal for FreshBuild,would there be
</I>&gt;<i> anyone like to be my mentor ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> =========================================================================
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> GSoC Proposal for FreshBuild
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personal Information
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Name: Jiacheng Jiang (Sharper than Blade)
</I>&gt;<i> Email: <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">sharper.than.bladez at gmail.com</A>

</I>&gt;<i> FreshBuild : Add MSVC and GCC Supprot to XBuild/MSBuild and Translate
</I>&gt;<i> Makefiles to MSBuild Project Files
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Abstract
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    This project is  to improve the XBuild so as to provide MSVC and
</I>&gt;<i> GCC support and translate makefiles to MSBuild project files.It is
</I>&gt;<i> intended to simplify the building process on both the Windows and
</I>&gt;<i> Linux platform and cut down building  problems.Also,many opensource
</I>&gt;<i> projects would benefit from the MSVC compiler in   performance, which
</I>&gt;<i> can usually produce faster bytecode.FreshBuild is based on XBuild and
</I>&gt;<i> would eventually merged into it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Benefits to the Mono and other Open Source Communities
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Mono is made up of C++ and C# source code ,and ,just like many
</I>&gt;<i> other opensource projects, it currently use GNU Make to build
</I>&gt;<i> itself,including compiling,generating docs and running unit tests.It
</I>&gt;<i> also provides XBuild,the counterpart of MSBuild,to build C# projects
</I>&gt;<i> .However ,it has fallen behind since the MSBuild 4 has been updated to
</I>&gt;<i> support VC++ compiler,which unified the building process on windows
</I>&gt;<i> platform.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Building is not easy.Many opensource softwares are mostly
</I>&gt;<i> targeting on Linux,such as ruby ,nginx,memcached and so on. To build
</I>&gt;<i> those softwares on Windows,you have to install Cygwin and use GCC,even
</I>&gt;<i> though the MSVC compiler is available.And to take the advantage of
</I>&gt;<i> GCC,you have to use GNU Make,which requires you to write
</I>&gt;<i> makefiles.While Java and .Net developers would prefer to some easy to
</I>&gt;<i> use ,more advanced and XML based build systems , such as Ant,Maven and
</I>&gt;<i> MSBuild.I really hope to develop a makefile to MSBuild project file
</I>&gt;<i> translator to migrate the GNU Make based projects,which would help me
</I>&gt;<i> to get rid of those makefiles.Mono would then be able to be built by
</I>&gt;<i> FreshBuild.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Deliverables
</I>&gt;<i>    1.A MSBuild extension to support MSVC on windows,which is the same
</I>&gt;<i> as the official one .
</I>&gt;<i>    2.A MSBuild extension to support GCC on both Windows and Linux
</I>&gt;<i>    3.A makefile translator.
</I>&gt;<i>    4.A visualizing tool to edit MSBuild project files
</I>&gt;<i>    5.A build server for FreshBuild
</I>&gt;<i>    6.Some docs ,some examples and a test suite.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    For such a project,I don't  have to worry about tests.So I would
</I>&gt;<i> take the ruby installer as my target.I'll translate its makefiles and
</I>&gt;<i> compile it with MSVC.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Project Details
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    MSBuild is an Ant-like build system for Visual Studio,which
</I>&gt;<i> supports VB and C# and is very extendible.Ever since VS2010 and
</I>&gt;<i> MSBuild 4,it supports C++ projects.XBuild is the opensource edition of
</I>&gt;<i> MSBuild.I would start from XBuild,add MSVC and GCC support to it and
</I>&gt;<i> implent some missing features.It is not difficult,but it needs a lot
</I>&gt;<i> of tests. I would also provide a MSBuild project file editor,in
</I>&gt;<i> Winforms.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    As to the makefile translator ,It is a challenge for
</I>&gt;<i> me.However,Microsoft also provided a NMake(the previous MSVC build
</I>&gt;<i> tool) file to MSBuild   project file converter. Since the capacity of
</I>&gt;<i> MSBuild is a superset  of GNU Make and it's so easy to extend ,it is
</I>&gt;<i> possible to develop such a translator.I 'll write a makefile parser
</I>&gt;<i> ,analyze the makefile structure ,do some replacement,and then generate
</I>&gt;<i> the XML form build scripts.I have some experience in developing a
</I>&gt;<i> compiler with Antlr.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Project Schedule
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    I wouldn't wait for the summer vocation to start the
</I>&gt;<i> development,though I would be less active before it.And during the
</I>&gt;<i> development process, I am eager to communicate with my community
</I>&gt;<i> users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    My schedule is made up of 16 weeks,starting from April 8,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Week 1-2 : Learn about the usage of MSBuild,go through the source
</I>&gt;<i> of XBuild and try to do extend it.Considering I have some experience
</I>&gt;<i> using and extending the MSBuild ,it wouldn't be a matter for me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Week 3-4 : Create sample VC++ projects for tests,and start to
</I>&gt;<i> develop the MSVC extension for XBuild.I just need to follow the
</I>&gt;<i> MSBuild api in MSDN ,still ,it would not be a matter to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Week 5-7 : Create sample GCC projects from the  VC++ projects,dive
</I>&gt;<i> into the GCC Manual and try to compile some softwares by Cygwin.I have
</I>&gt;<i> to do a lot of reading,so it would cost a two weeks.And then I will
</I>&gt;<i> spend one week to develop the GCC extension .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Week 9-10 : Study the GNU Make grammar and read through its
</I>&gt;<i> manual.Also I should do some experiments on it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Week 11-13 : Start writing the translator.I would write a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> unit tests and develop the parser with Antlr.And I need to solve a lot
</I>&gt;<i> of problems.Also,I need to try it on Linux.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Week 14-15 : Develop the MSBuild Project file editor and build
</I>&gt;<i> server.If necessary ,I would also need to fix some bugs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Week 16 : Hunt bugs and get feedback from community users.

</I>&gt;<i> Bio
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    I am a junior student in the South China University of
</I>&gt;<i> Technology.I have a lot of experience in C#,Java,PHP and Ruby.I have
</I>&gt;<i> great interest  in developing high performance compilers and
</I>&gt;<i> servers.I've wrote a Javafx-like language grammar and a matlab
</I>&gt;<i> language grammar with antlr.I like opensource softwares ,but sometimes
</I>&gt;<i> have problem in compiling,installing and fixing dependencies,which
</I>&gt;<i> costs me a lot of effort and makes me angry.So I came up with this
</I>&gt;<i> project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       Eligibility: In many ways,I am an eligible student.
