<PRE>hello all

Im in the middle of a crucial project, so any help will be really welcomed

1) I have designed so far a GUI, which will be working eventually on a linux
server. The desired function of the GUI is to deliver specific linux
commands to the terminal, as well as reading from it, with the latter
staying hidden if possible.

For instance, by pressing a button on the GUI, i would like the &quot;ls&quot; command
to be delivered and executed in the backround terminal, or the GUI to be
displaying the terminal status. At this point, the &quot;sudo&quot; command is not
necessary, only the transmission of the message is.

So my main question is if a Mono command like the one described above
exists.


2) Additionally, id like the commands above to be delivered by a similar GUI
based on Windows, or be read by the connection window (server static IP, ssh
connection and putty window)

For this case, im thinking to build 2 same looking GUI's, but with different
code where it's necessary for the transmission of the message, 1 for linux
and 1 for windows.

Is this goal feasible?


So far the GUI shows only the functions it should be giving. It is written
in VB2010, which will be converted to Mono shortly. If any of u guys want to
have a peek, tell me so i can send it.


Big thanks for ur time
