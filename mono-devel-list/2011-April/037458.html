Try ODBC.&#160; Mono has support for ODBC via System.Data.Odbc namespace in assembly System.Data.&#160;&#160; I'm sure Sybase has an ODBC driver too.&#160; If not, there is always FreeTDS.

Mono.Data.SybaseClient was removed because no one maintained it.Besides, Mono.Data.SybaseClient only worked with ASE, it did not work with ASA.

If you are interested in maintaining this provider, I suggest forking it and creating an account on github to commit your changes and provide a download link for others to get it.

    Hi,

    

    Probably it was removed because it doesn't work with ASE 15.5, which
    is the current version.

    I tried it, and it just didn't work.

    

    If you find a driver that works, let me know.

    I wanted to try how compatible Sybase is with MS-SQL, since they
    have a common ancestor.

    Couldn't get Sybase to work with Ubuntu 10 (worked fine on 9), but
    10.10's anyway a desaster.

    Looking forward to v11, coming April 28/29. Else I'm switching back
    to good old Debian.

    

    My understanding is that Sybase sells their .NET driver, but that
    only together with a support contract (&amp; accompanying download
    login) that you don't really need, and there is no telling whether
    that .NET driver works on Linux.

    

    All in all pretty bad if you only want to evaluate it, because
    right-now you can't.

    

    Kind regards

    

    Stefan

    Hello,
      

      
      I see that the Mono.Data.SybaseClient driver was removed from
        the Mono source tree on March 2, 2010 with the commit message
        &quot;Moved depreciated library.&quot; &#160;Was this driver depreciated in
        favor of another driver for connecting to Sybase or was it
        simply removed due to lack of a maintainer? &#160;
      

      
      I ask because I recently began using this driver from 2.6.7,
        and it works great (and it's blazingly fast) except that it does
        not support VARCHARs greater than 255 characters (this was added
        in Sybase 12.5x, I believe). &#160;
      

      
      I've changed the request and response capability flags in
        Tds50.Connect() so that they match those found in jtds. &#160;I'm now
        getting the same server response (verified with wireshark) as
        with jtds which includes the entire, non-truncated varchar, but
        for some reason, the driver doesn't process the response packets
        correctly--IDataReader.Read() always returns false even when the
        db returned results.
      

      
      I'll keep digging into this, but I would certainly appreciate
        any advice.
      

      
      

      
      Regards,
      

      
      Troy
