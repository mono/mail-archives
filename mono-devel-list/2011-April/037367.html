<PRE>Hello all,

Thanks for your feedback.

Miguel:

&gt;<i> Are you also planning on adding the table dumping features?   They are
</I>&gt;<i> not necessary if we keep monodis around.
</I>
I will probably work on this last, but I hope to get around to it, yeah. That way we can remove monodis and the burden of maintaining it, instead of just adding to the maintenance burden.

Jb:

&gt;<i> As I wrote in my earlier mail, there's a lot of code that can be lifted from:
</I>

Thanks, I've seen that and I am referring to it. My goal of being character-for-character the same as monodis means that I'm not using your existing code as is.

&gt;<i> ildasm should be in mcs/tools, ilasm is in mcs just for historical
</I>&gt;<i> reasons. Also I don't think we should require python for the tests, a
</I>&gt;<i> simple Makefile should be enough.
</I>

Thanks, I've moved it to tools, and I've rewritten by tests in Make.

Marek:

&gt;<i> Another drawback is that it's very easy to crash/SIGSEGV monodis with 
</I>&gt;<i> broken metadata/MSIL. If the new version could be made more robust that 
</I>&gt;<i> would be great too.
</I>
Hopefully it will be. When I get around to it, I could get hold of some broken files and perhaps implement some kind of error recovery logic, but that's for the future.

Regards,

Chris Seaton
