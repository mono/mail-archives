Sadly yes... it blocks us from creating useful WCF diagnostic xml logs.

I've never seen such a problem in .NET 3.0, 3.5 and 4.0. MS probably 
fixed it.

&gt;<i> Furthermore, the only solution I know of to fix this (or knew of circa 2002), was to use a finalizer on TraceListener, which MSDN states TraceListener does not provide.
</I>
As mentioned in my first post, the finalizer approach doesn't work. The 
Stream object could be already finalized before the TextWriter is disposed.

&gt;<i> Consequently, I believe that TraceListener is not supposed to flush the stream at all, and if you really want the stream to be flushed you should set Trace.AutoFlush=true, either programmatically or via .config file; MSDN kindly provides the .config file snippet here:
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Autoflush does not work for XmlWriterTraceListener, because its 
Dispose() calls XmlWriter.Close() which gives additional outputs 
(enclosing EndElements) to the TextWriter. Here again, the TextWriter 
could be GC-ed before XmlWriter is being disposed.

Though if there is no viable approach, I'd take another approach, to 
create my own critical-finalizable Stream, TextWriter and XmlWriter 
which refers each other. I wanted to confirm there is no easier way, as 
it is messy :/
