<PRE>Hello everyone,

    My name is Jiangcheng Jiang ,or you may call me Sharp.I&#8216;ve been
planning to improve the XBuild so as to provide MSVC and GCC support
as a GSoC project.More importantly,I would like to develop a Makefile
to MSBuild Project translator to take place of GNU Make.This project
is intended to simplify the building process on both the Windows and
Linux platform and reduce building  problems.Also,many opensource
projects would benefit from the MSVC compiler in terms of performance.

    Here are my goals:
    1.A MSBuild extension to support MSVC on windows,which is the same
as the official one .
    2.A MSBuild extension to support GCC on both windows and linux
    3.A makefile translator.
    4.A visualizing tool to edit MSBuild projects
    4.A build server for freshbuild

    For such a project,there would always be plenty of test projects
for me.And I would take the ruby installer as my target.
    I am eager for you feedbacks.

Sharp (Jiacheng Jiang)
