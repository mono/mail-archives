<PRE>Hello,

I see that the Mono.Data.SybaseClient driver was removed from the Mono
source tree on March 2, 2010 with the commit message &quot;Moved depreciated
library.&quot;  Was this driver depreciated in favor of another driver for
connecting to Sybase or was it simply removed due to lack of a maintainer?

I ask because I recently began using this driver from 2.6.7, and it works
great (and it's blazingly fast) except that it does not support VARCHARs
greater than 255 characters (this was added in Sybase 12.5x, I believe).

I've changed the request and response capability flags in Tds50.Connect() so
that they match those found in jtds.  I'm now getting the same server
response (verified with wireshark) as with jtds which includes the entire,
non-truncated varchar, but for some reason, the driver doesn't process the
response packets correctly--IDataReader.Read() always returns false even
when the db returned results.

I'll keep digging into this, but I would certainly appreciate any advice.


Regards,

Troy
