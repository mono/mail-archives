<PRE>Hiii,
I am Darshan Modani,  a Computer Science a graduate student. I am GSOC
aspirant. I consider myself to be good in C# and thats what my area of
interest is. Until GSOC list of accepted organisations was released i didn't
knew about Mono-project. I really feel the concept and idea is great. I
installed my mono-framework on mac-osx, and was amazed to find ASP.NET
working on mac.

I am very much  interested in mono-project and would like to contribute.
Browsing through the list of project ideas, i found that improvements in
mono-develop IDE interests me such as Webkit based HTML editor, CSS support
or JS support. I clearly understand the project requirements but still very
skeptic. I am proficient in C# but very new to mono. 

Any suggestions and some pointers before applying would be greatly
appreciated. 
Also I want to know the mentors of the projects Webkit based HTML editor,
CSS support or JS support under Web Tools.

Thanks
Darshan
