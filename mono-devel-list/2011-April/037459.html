We're using Sybase 15.5 and the database server apparently goes into
backwards-compatibility mode depending on the capability flags that the
driver sends, but in this compatibility mode, it does not support any
features added after about version 12.5x.

If you find a driver that works, let me know.

</I>
I had that idea, too, and I've seen it suggested in some pretty old forum
postings and mail lists, but the protocols seem to have diverged too much
over time because I haven't been able to get it working with either the Mono
or .NET MS-SQL server drivers.  The jtds driver covers both servers because
it does a lot of conditional processing based on both the jdbc connection
string and packets returned from the server.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
So far, I've only been working in .NET on Windows, but I'll try it in mono
on linux if/when I get it working.

My understanding is that Sybase sells their .NET driver, but that only
&gt;<i> together with a support contract (&amp; accompanying download login) that you
</I>&gt;<i> don't really need, and there is no telling whether that .NET driver works on
</I>&gt;<i> Linux.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
We've got a Sybase support contract, so I've been able to test their .NET
driver.  It works, but it is horribly slow.  It is slightly faster than
their OLEDB driver in some cases and slower in others.  But I don't think it
will ever work on linux because the Sybase ADO.NET driver is actually just a
managed wrapper around their unmanaged windows driver.

I'll keep you informed if I'm able to make any more progress with updating
the mono driver to work with 12.5 and greater.


Cheers,

Troy
