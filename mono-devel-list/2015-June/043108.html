<PRE>Hello guys,

I'm trying to cross-compile (from Ubuntu 14.04) Mono for ARM following this tutorial <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/supported-platforms/arm/">http://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/supported-platforms/arm/</A> but the links that show how configure ScratchBox are outdated and I can't find anything on the internet on how to successful setup an environment and cross-compile mono for ARM...

The idea is to build it as a static library so I can use it embedded as suggested here: <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/docs/advanced/embedding/">http://www.mono-project.com/docs/advanced/embedding/</A>

For the sake of information, the target ARM device runs a proprietary striped down distribution based on debian and we have no access to its terminal or any kind of access to the OS. It is a payment terminal from www.ingenico.com&lt;<A HREF="http://www.ingenico.com">http://www.ingenico.com</A>&gt; and it has an ARM9 processor and uses a proprietary SDK that looks like uses GNU ARM 4.3.4 toolchain with an IDE based on Eclipse as you can see in the following picture:

[cid:<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">image001.jpg at 01D0A9E2.F3665F60</A>]

The only way we have to use mono on it is by adding it as a static lib and import the header in order to embedded it, create a thin C layer that will only bootstrap the .net app (all their API calls will be PInvoked after add Mono to it).

Anyone has has a good documentation on:


1.      How to setup a cross-compile environment on Ubuntu

2.      Compile Mono to ARM as an static library

Any help would be very appreciated.

Thank you very much!

Best regards,
