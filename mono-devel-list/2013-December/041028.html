<PRE>The problem is that there is no anything simular to MEM_RESERVE and
MEM_COMMIT from Windows (flags for VirtualAlloc/VirtualAllocEx), so there
is no way to properly reserve a large block of virtual address space. BTW,
windows threads reserve a lot of address space using MEM_RESERVE and then
use SEH/VEH to detect, when memory should be commited, so it uses the same
&quot;overcommit&quot; mechanics. You can create a lot of threads with large stacks,
try to use it and get out of memory exception when, actually, trying to
push something on your stack.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Whether or not you think allowing overcommit is a good idea is very much
</I>&gt;<i> dependent on whether you think a good return from malloc should allow you
</I>&gt;<i> to use the memory you just asked for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In fairness, the problem is typically worst in multi-threaded programs
</I>&gt;<i> that can't handle segmented thread stacks - they have to reserve enough
</I>&gt;<i> space for reasonable levels of stack depth and stack-local data so they
</I>&gt;<i> have to reserve VM space to ensure that malloc doesn't place another block
</I>&gt;<i> after the heap that's actually in use.  Laziness is actually allocating the
</I>&gt;<i> space and relying on the OS to allow overcommit and not actually back such
</I>&gt;<i> memory until needed, rather than just reserving a VM range and allocating
</I>&gt;<i> on fault.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The prod servers I had showed no use of swap, about 6gig out of 32
</I>&gt;<i> physical in use (with the rest as buffers) - and thread starts and allocs
</I>&gt;<i> were failing.  Needless to say all the machines we'd used for dev, qa, and
</I>&gt;<i> load testing had overcommit 0 and we got mugged as a result.
