<PRE>Good Morning.

Bug 10784 (
<A HREF="https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?format=multiple&amp;id=10784">https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?format=multiple&amp;id=10784</A>) is a
major blocker for me, and a big obstacle for larger applications moving
from .NET to Mono. Because I need this fixed, I am prepared to fix it
myself.

I'm wondering if anyone knowledgeable in this area could answer these few,
short questions just to confirm a few things.

Removing the offending assertion from class.c, and running generated test
cases that previously triggered it, I did not notice any incorrect
behaviour in terms of reflection, the 'is' operator failing, or the wrong
implementation of functions being used. Is there anywhere that I should be
looking in particular or any particular type of tests I can use to expose
an underlying fault that removing this assertion causes?

Is it possible that this assertion is vestigial or unnecessary?
