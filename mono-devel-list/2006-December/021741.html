<PRE>Hi,

I've developed and installed a webservice application.
Testing it connecting from the LAN it works well, when I NAT the 
server making it reachable from internet I start having problems.
Using the test form, if I test it using the domain name I receive a 
Name Resolution error.
Looking on the net I've found that mono webservices needs to be able 
to resolve the dns name used for calling it, and this can be the 
source of the Name Resolution error, I can fix it with a dns workaround.
If I test it using the public ip address (that is converted into the 
private ip address by Squid) after a while I receive a 
&quot;System.Web.HttpException: The request timed out.&quot;
I think that the second step (after name resolution) is that 
webservice needs to be able to contact the resolved ip or the ip used 
to call it.
If this is true it can be a problem cause it's usual to have a server 
not directly connected to internet but only natted and usually this 
server is not able to reach the public ip used to call it.
I tried the same webservice under m$ framework 1.1 with the same 
network settings and it seems to work correctly.
I don't think mono can have this limitation so probably I'm missing 
something. Could someone give me an hint?
