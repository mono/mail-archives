Subject: [Mono-dev] revert of r104029/30/31

&gt;<i> Gert,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please *post* your patches for review *before* committing them!
</I>&gt;<i> Those changes were obviously untested since they broke the unit tests.
</I>
Sorry about that. I was too confident that these changes were harmless, my 
mistake.

I'll look into this, and - if you want - post an updated patch for review.

&gt;<i> They also mix formatting changes (not all in respect of mono style) with
</I>&gt;<i> code changes (parameter names) making this harder, than it has to be, to
</I>&gt;<i> review.
</I>
I'm pretty sure all the formatting changes respect the &quot;mono style&quot;, but 
feel free to correct me.

I know we had a &quot;discussion&quot; on whether braces for the class/namespace 
should go on a separate line or not, and I know you thought they should go 
on the same line. However, both the mono guidelines and several committers 
on #mono confirmed that they should go on a separate line.

I don't think I want to spend an hour or two splitting up the argument name 
changes with the formatting changes, so if you prefer to keep the sources in 
the state they were before my changes then I'll just revert my local 
changes.

My formatting changes were limited to:

* changes loads of spaces to tabs
* removing loads of trailing tabs
* moving braces on class/namespace declaration to separate line (probably 
less than 2% of my changes)

&gt;<i> Also note that such *big* changes always cause a lot of conflicts for
</I>&gt;<i> the code maintainer(s), since they often have uncommitted code or patch
</I>&gt;<i> in testing. So a bit of warning before committing is a *minimum*.
</I>
True.

Gert
