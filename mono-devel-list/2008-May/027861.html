<PRE>
Hopefully this question was not asked before but during my efforts to connect
to a mysql database I encountered a problem. After a connection has been
established the program is not able to quit anymore. At the end of the
Main-Method it simply keeps running.

The following sample code is not able to exit (after a connection has been
established succesfully). If an error occures the program will exit.

(This small example is inspired from the mono page
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/MySQL">http://www.mono-project.com/MySQL</A>)
-------------------------------
IDbConnection dbcon = null;

string connectionString =
  &quot;Server=localhost;&quot; +
  &quot;Database=dbname;&quot; +
  &quot;User ID=user;&quot; +
  &quot;Password=password;&quot; +
  &quot;Pooling=false&quot;;
dbcon = new MySqlConnection(connectionString);
dbcon.Open();

dbcon.Close();
dbcon = null;
-------------------------------

I executed this sample program with mdb (mono debug) and it showed me that
for the connection 3 threads got started from which only 1 stoped normally.

I am using mono 1.2.6 with MySql Connector 5.0.8.1 (Ubuntu repo).

Under windows the sample program (and similar ones) exit without problems,
even with the MySql Connector from the Ubuntu repos.

Am I doing something wrong or is this a serious problem?

Thanks for every single answer,

- Clas
