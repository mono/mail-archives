</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Gert,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please *post* your patches for review *before* committing them!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Those changes were obviously untested since they broke the unit tests.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry about that. I was too confident that these changes were harmless, my 
</I>&gt;<i> mistake.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll look into this, and - if you want - post an updated patch for review.
</I>
I'm not interested in reviewing a HUGE patch that mix the functional and
non-functional changes together. It's huge, hard to read, easy to
miss(*) and I already have spent too much time on this one (trying to
post-commit review it, reverting it, writing about it...)

(*) the fact that unit test caught one error does not mean there are no
others - and I don't believe the changes are worth regression(s).

&gt;<i> &gt; They also mix formatting changes (not all in respect of mono style) with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code changes (parameter names) making this harder, than it has to be, to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; review.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm pretty sure all the formatting changes respect the &quot;mono style&quot;, but 
</I>&gt;<i> feel free to correct me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know we had a &quot;discussion&quot; on whether braces for the class/namespace 
</I>&gt;<i> should go on a separate line or not, and I know you thought they should go 
</I>&gt;<i> on the same line. However, both the mono guidelines 
</I>
Please show me where in
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Coding_Guidelines">http://www.mono-project.com/Coding_Guidelines</A>
since all examples keep them on the same line ? (and this is not a code
block either ;-)

So it's one of the case that's unclear ? just like some other stuff that
was changed (or removed) since the original style guide ? 

I don't mind if, in doubt, you follow your own interpretation. However
please DO NOT start modifying existing code based on them (own
interpretation).

Fact is that the *style* is there to help everyone, just like doing
*small* patches are. Yes some old SD code breaks a *lot* of rules and I
slowly fixed some when the code needed fixing. 

Why ? because breaking the &quot;as small as possible commits&quot; rule makes
merging harder and SVN history less useful. Updating the current code
style is not gonna offset the cost of this (even less if it requires a
full review because it includes other changes as well).

&gt;<i> and several committers 
</I>&gt;<i> on #mono confirmed that they should go on a separate line.
</I>
&quot;confirmed&quot; ? how ? who ? Maybe they just tell you what they do, or what
they like ?

Seriously we have a document for this. It's not perfect (and feel free
to start _another_ discussion about this) and there are a lot of rules I
didn't like (but I learned to follow them).

But like I said in doubt just *dont* touch it.

&gt;<i> I don't think I want to spend an hour or two splitting up the argument name 
</I>&gt;<i> changes with the formatting changes, 
</I>
I understand this because I don't want to spend an hour or two to find
other problems in the diff (and it's clear it's something that needs to
be done).

&gt;<i> so if you prefer to keep the sources in 
</I>&gt;<i> the state they were before my changes then I'll just revert my local 
</I>&gt;<i> changes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My formatting changes were limited to:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * changes loads of spaces to tabs
</I>&gt;<i> * removing loads of trailing tabs
</I>&gt;<i> * moving braces on class/namespace declaration to separate line (probably 
</I>&gt;<i> less than 2% of my changes)
</I>
Even if 100% of the changes are ok and were made without other changes
(parameters) I still think (and would have told you) that it was not
worth the time you invested in this.

&gt;<i> &gt; Also note that such *big* changes always cause a lot of conflicts for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the code maintainer(s), since they often have uncommitted code or patch
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in testing. So a bit of warning before committing is a *minimum*.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> True.
</I>
Yes, a lot of time could have been saved with a quick email (or ping on
IRC).

Sebastien
