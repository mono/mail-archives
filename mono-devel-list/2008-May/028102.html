<PRE>In preparation of integrating Visual Studio compilation of the runtime
as part of the cygwin make process I have done some cleanup with the
solution and projects files in MSVC.

I still have more to do as not all projects are building completely,
but they were pretty busted when I found them ;)

The main point of this patch was to unify the output directories for
each project and configuration.

Working :
eglib
libgc
libmono
genmdesc
monoburg
mono

Broken and Disabled :
test-invoke
test-metadata
teste
monodiet
monodis
monograph
pedump

test_eglib works for all eglib targets but not for the non eglib
targets.  I would like to get that working with a link to the real
glib so we can have comparison tests.

I will continue to work on the broken projects if this is approved.
Let me know if they are all still needed.

The non-eglib targets for x64 are completely shut off simply because
we have no glib for x64.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions.  Also is the OK to commit?

Thanks
