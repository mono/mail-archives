<PRE>Hi,

Thanks for the review.

threads_initialized is required by CorExitProcess. It is intended to shut 
down the runtime (including calling finalizers) properly and is called by 
msvcrt.dll (there are a lot of versions with different names) as well. I 
think that mono_thread_suspend_all_other_threads () is required for proper 
shutdown but CorExitProcess may be called at any time so 
mono_thread_suspend_all_other_threads () can fail with with an exception 
because the critical section was not initialized. I think that the only 
situation when threads_initialized is needed is when Mono itself calls 
&quot;exit&quot; (implemented in msvcrt.dll) while initializing that will call back to 
CorExitProcess on the same thread so there should not be a race.

If I'll implement CorBindToRuntimeEx I'll most likely add an initialization 
lock in coree.c that will eliminate any possible races in initialization and 
shutdown (including CorExitProcess) functions but I think the current code 
is good for now. Note that a proper CorBindToRuntimeEx implementation would 
need to eliminate calling &quot;exit&quot; on failures because the current 
initialization routines assume that they are are in mono.exe that has to be 
terminated on failure.

The renaming is not needed but I forgot to clean this up in the original 
check-in and makes naming convention inconsistent. I'll commit that as a 
separate revision.

Note that tests having Msvcrt in their names are not woring on Mono yet.

Hi Korn&#233;l,

What is the reason of your changes in threads.c? I can't see it making any
diference and it's possibly racy as there is no membar around the new static
variable.

@@ -203,7 +221,7 @@
  IMAGE_DOS_HEADER* DosHeader;
  IMAGE_NT_HEADERS* NtHeaders;
  DWORD* Address;
- DWORD dwOldProtect;
+ DWORD OldProtect;


Please avoid this variable renaming as it bloats the patch. If renaming is
really needed, it should be a separate patch.


Thanks,
Rodrigo

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mixed-mode assembly support is currently (temporarily) disabled in SVN.
</I>&gt;<i> This patch is supposed to fix the issue reported by Jonathan and reenable
</I>&gt;<i> mixed-mode assembly support.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> May I commit this patch?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also note that I have added some mixed-mode assembly tests in r102861 that
</I>&gt;<i> can be compiled using Visual Studio 2005 or later.
</I>&gt;<i> MixedModeLibrary/NativeApp is a special case because it tests _CorDllMain
</I>&gt;<i> and loads mono.dll so has to be executed without mono.exe.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>  Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * domain.c: Open exe_image anyway so that it can be fixed up. Add a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mono_close_exe_image function that closes exe_image.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * image.c: Fix reference counting when DLL image is loaded using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> LoadLibrary
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> outside of image.c.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * threads.c: Add threads_initialized that enables coree.c to call
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mono_thread_suspend_all_other_threads at any time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * coree.c: Some improvements and add mono_set_act_ctx that loads manifest
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> file from the main assembly when process is created from mono.exe. This 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> required for MSVCRT support but may be used by other assemblies as well
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> example for XP Visual Style support.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Please review the patch and if you like it, please approve it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Jonathan, please try this patch if it fixes the issue you have reported.
