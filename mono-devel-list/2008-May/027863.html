What version of mono are you running?

Looking at our SVN version I assume you're hitting the g_warning which
would say something like:


_wapi_thread_set_termination_details: error looking up thread handle ...

but you don't include the exact error so its hard to say.  This is
something that shouldn't happen unless the runtime has become
inconsistent with its threading state.  Is your server open source?  can
you make a smaller testcase that exhibits the problem (even if it takes
12 hours to produce itself, it can give us a better idea of whats going
on).  If your server isn't open source, you can also provide the source
to just novell thru our bugzilla (<A HREF="http://bugzilla.novell.com/">http://bugzilla.novell.com/</A>) by
clicking the private button while uploading.

Thanks
