<PRE>Hi,

Mixed-mode assembly support now should be fixed.

There are some basic test in mono/tests/mixed-mode. Note that test havin 
Msvc in their names are not supported yet. Also note that MixedModeLibrary 
is a special case because that tests _CorDllMain so NativeApp.exe has to be 
executed as a native executable without mono.exe.

All of these tests require Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 (2008 compiles them as 
well) and there is no open source compiler that supports C++/CLI.

I didn't create Makefiles because I'm not that good at Makefiles and I don't 
know what exactly should be performed by these Makefiles.

There are two tools that accept the .sln files as input:
C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\MSBuild.exe
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\vcpackages\vcbuild.exe

msbuild.exe /p:Configuration=Release &quot;MixedModeLibrary.sln&quot;
vcbuild.exe &quot;MixedModeLibrary.sln&quot; &quot;Release|Win32&quot;

I would vote for vcbuild.

Compiling without the project files would result in duplicate configuration 
for Makefile and project files that could go out of sync.

Including these tests in the build process on Windows test machines could 
ensure that mixed-mode assembly support will not break in the future.

Thank you very much for your help.

Korn&#233;l
