<PRE>
Web-based forums for Mono discussions have been added at
<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/forums">http://www.go-mono.com/forums</A>

As you know, most active Mono community members participate in on-line
discussions through our mailing lists; however, many Mono users have
expressed a preference for web forums based discussions.

In order to address this demand for an official forums for Mono, while
keeping the community engaged in our mailing lists, we have embedded
nabble.com into our site to create a bridge between the two groups.  So, you
can now use whichever method you prefer participate in the community.

In order to post through the web interface, you will need to have a Nabble
account.  If you are already subscribed to this and/or other mailing lists,
it would be preferable to register your Nabble account with your subscribed
address.  Alternatively, if you decide to create your account under a
different address, you also have the option to modify your Nabble account
settings to link in your other address(es).
