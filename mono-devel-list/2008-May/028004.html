Yes and I fail to see why non-functional, trivial patches should have
nothing else than low priority. Unless I missed a memo where they became
more important than bugs filled in bugzilla ? ;-) I often heard people
asking when X or Y feature will become available (if ever) but it's
quite rare to heard about someone (other that the author) asking for
such (non-functional &amp; trivial) patches to be applied.

Also I totally disagree with your *non-breaking* part since experience
just told us (and not for the first time) that:

* Any patch, even trivial, can break things. The bigger the patch the
most likely it will.

* People do *NOT* test their trivial patches (and yes I have committed
this sin myself so this is not targeted to anyone in specific).

Sebastien
