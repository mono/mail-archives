This is great news!
Just a question and a suggestion:

- Does the integration effort include any open source code that we can 
reuse? (Sorry if I'm missing the point, I don't know how Nabble works.) 
I ask it because I only know other alternative for doing this type of 
synchronization, and I'd love to know another one (and more points if 
it's Mono-based!).

- I would add some more forums to the system: the Gendarme mailing-list, 
and the Banshee mailing-list (well, this one is not Mono itself, but I 
think they have forums that are not synchronized, so maybe it's 
interesting for them to switch and start using this).

Regards,

	Andres
