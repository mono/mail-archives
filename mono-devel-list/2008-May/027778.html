<PRE>2008/5/5 Jonathan Thomas &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">jonathan.oomph at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I am very interested in using the gstreamer bindings in a mono project, but
</I>&gt;<i> I could really use some advice.  I can't seem to find the gstreamer-sharp
</I>&gt;<i> assembly anywhere.  The only luck I've had so far is some development notes
</I>&gt;<i> back in 2006.  Do any mono up-to-date bindings exist for the gstreamer
</I>&gt;<i> framework?  Is there a better multi-media framework I should use?
</I>
Sadly, the GStreamer# bindings were never completed, and have been
unmaintianed for some time. I don't know how hard it'd be to get it
off the ground, though this would certainly be nice to see.

&gt;<i> Ultimately, I would like to create a non-linear video editing application
</I>&gt;<i> using C# and the mono framework.  I have been told that gstreamer is the
</I>&gt;<i> most powerful media framework in linux (at least that's what I was told).
</I>
GStreamer is arguably the most powerful modular media framework on
Linux, yes, and works on other platforms too. Banshee (Mono-powered
media app) uses Gstreamer via P/Invoking a C wrapper library.

There was some debate over whether gstreamer in its current state it's
suitable for editing:

<A HREF="http://blogs.gnome.org/uraeus/2006/12/08/comment-on-diva/">http://blogs.gnome.org/uraeus/2006/12/08/comment-on-diva/</A>

However, that was some time ago, and I'm pretty sure that any such
issues can be fixed.

I'd suggest taking a look at resurrecting Diva, a Mono based nonlinear
video editing app which was widely praised, but stalled a while ago
from lack of contibutions. AFAIK it also used a C  library to
implement the core editing features. Sadly the website seems to be
down right now, but I suspect other people on this list can direct you
to mirrors.
