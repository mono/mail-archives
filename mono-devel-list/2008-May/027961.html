<PRE>Hi to all:

Is not my intention to make a ugly discussion about this, but I know 
that some efforts are made in Gsoc to help mono in different and 
important things and I wonder about the feature of some of them, 
specially 2:

- Mono-Windows-Forms Designer (MWF-Designer), different pools some time 
ago show that this is a important thing to allow to a lot of programmer 
to migrate to mono/linux, is this effort have a future?, or be wasted?

- GStreamer# (<A HREF="http://abock.org/tag/gstreamer/">http://abock.org/tag/gstreamer/</A>), this is the second 
effort for a wrapper for this media library, as far as I know the main 
things are kind of ready (sure lot of test and bug fix are needed but 
that is true for lot of mono aspects..), this have a future?, is death?


Any comment?, info about the future of this things?

Mauricio

</PRE>
