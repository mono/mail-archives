On which stack and thread is that function called? You obviously can't call
it on the overflown one.

Well, the thread abort machinery was devised to handle async exceptions
started from a foreign thread. You can definitely use the low level
machinery to implement
stack overflow on your target. I would be willing to merge changes that
improve the low level bits and stack overflow handling to enable such a
thing, but there's no
reason to butcher the thread abort specific bits just for a quick hack.

As I told you before, I can't make an informed comment until you give a
better picture of how exactly a stack overflow is handled on your RTOS.

Mono OVF code uses soft guard pages to enable native to continue once we
reach a soft limit in stack usage so we can safely finish processing and
raise a
managed exception. But once it hits the hard limit while in native code,
the only viable option is to abort.


&gt;<i> The out-of-memory exception is almost the exact same story... When memory
</I>&gt;<i> gets low, I want to be able to do something that allows native code to
</I>&gt;<i> continue, but OutOfMemoryException is thrown when execution returns to
</I>&gt;<i> managed code.  I assume there is no mechanism in there for this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
OOM is quite a different beast, it's handled synchronously since we know
exactly when we're out of managed memory. Mono doesn't handle native
allocation failures
well and this is something I would love to see patches for. Managed
allocation failures are well handled with sgen.
