<PRE>Is there any approach that will use LLVM to JIT the emitted bytecode?   Also will LLVM be used on non-dynamically inserted  bytecode called by the emitted code?  If I have the following call sequence:

	caller -&gt; dynamically emitted code -&gt; precompiled bytecode

Where &quot;-&gt;&quot; means calls.   I have performance sensitive code that would be called by the emitted code.  Want to make sure that it would be JITed with LLVM (which I've seen to be often 2x faster), in spite of going through a dynamic code path (which appears to be JITed with the mono JIT compiler).
