<PRE>I don't fully understand your scenario, but I _suspect_ that what you want is a &quot;hypervisor,&quot;[0] which is basically a nano-kernel (of sorts) that other OS kernels run atop as peers to one another.  There are several commercial and open-source versions, such as Xen [1], Kernel Based Virtualization [2] and VMware ESX [3].

Now, I realize that you asked for a non-virtualized solution, but iirc at least some of those permit ~direct access to hardware (e.g. video cards tend not to be virtualized), and offhand it's the only technology I can think of that is remotely close to what you're asking for.

</I>&gt;<i> I am about to start a project and I am not sure whether a part of the project is possible. I want to know if there is any way to launch a new process in the current operating system which goes through the bootstrapping cycle in a thread separate from the loaded OS threads. Let me explain it better.
</I>&gt;<i> Imagine we have a loaded operating system, for example Ubuntu Linux, and a single-core processor. I want to launch a process with Superuser permissions, which will create a thread in the current OS. That thread should give BIOS/EFI a command to load a boot image, based on the mono livecd,  without interfering the OS itself. And, what is more important &#8211; without virtualizing any hardware. Instead of using virtual machines, I want to access the hardware resources of a computer directly. This should result in two separate kernels sharing different parts of hardware resources on a computer. In other words, the goal is to create two simulated computers from one real with each kernel using its own hardware resources, i.e. dividing the hardware resources into two parts.
</I>&gt;<i> I know it is probably possible by creating two custom kernels which run asynchronously and each one giving a command to run the other. With more than one processor cores it should probably be possible to run the kernels synchronously. The monitor should make a split-screen and the kernel managing the active screen should accept all the input. But is it possible to do this without modifying the no kernel?
</I>&gt;<i> More simply, can the second OS run as a process in the first OS?
</I>&gt;<i> In case I didn&#8217;t explain it well, I&#8217;ve included an attachment which should make it clear.
