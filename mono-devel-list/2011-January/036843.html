<PRE>Hi,

During debugging a C# wrapper for a C-library I have stumbled over an
unexpected alignment issue in mono / C#:


It looks like that the internal alignment of data structures deviates on
32-bit X86 systems from the standard ELF alignment.

I've created a minimal testcase which can be downloaded from here:
<A HREF="http://chkr.fedorapeople.org/mono-alignment/">http://chkr.fedorapeople.org/mono-alignment/</A>

1. libalignmenttest.c:
a C-library containing a function &quot;testfunc&quot; which returns a structure
containing a &quot;double&quot;:

struct  t1 {
    int i1;
    double d1;
};
The function sets the values always to i1 = 1234 and d1 = 1.1.

2. test.cs:
a C# file which calls &quot;testfunc&quot; from the C-library:

Since all of the variables of the &quot;t1&quot; structure are blittable types, it
should be possible just to define the structure in C# and declare the
appropriate function using DllImport.

<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Interop_with_Native_Libraries">http://www.mono-project.com/Interop_with_Native_Libraries</A> :
&quot;[...] so if an unmanaged function returns a pointer to a structure,
IntPtr must be used for &quot;safe&quot; code, or a pointer to the structure can
be used for &quot;unsafe&quot; code.[...]&quot;.

I have chosen the 2nd choice:
--------------------------------------------
struct t1 {
    public int i1;
    public double d1;
}

[DllImport(&quot;libalignmenttest&quot;)]
unsafe public static extern t1* testfunc();
--------------------------------------------

3. Running the test:
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -o libalignmenttest.so -shared
-Wl,-soname,libalignmenttest.so libalignmenttest.c
$ gmcs -unsafe test.cs
$ mono ./test.exe
i1: 1234
d1: 5.35799274627359E-313
$

So the value of &quot;d1&quot; is messed up. It looks like that C# aligns double
data types on 8-byte boundaries but linux ELF ABI defines an 4-byte
alignment which is used in the native library. If I restrict the
alignment of C# to 4-byte alignment by adding &quot;[StructLayout
(LayoutKind.Sequential, Pack=4)]&quot;, it works fine.

4. Definition of C# / ELF alignment:

The X86 ELF ABI defines that double values should be 4-byte aligned
X86 ELF ABI: <A HREF="http://refspecs.freestandards.org/elf/abi386-4.pdf">http://refspecs.freestandards.org/elf/abi386-4.pdf</A> , Figure
3-1.

The ECMA CLI standard defines the alignment so:
<A HREF="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-335.pdf">http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-335.pdf</A> ,
12.6.2
&quot;[...] and int64, unsigned int64, and float64 start on an address
divisible by 4 or 8, depending upon the target architecture. [...] It is
strongly recommended that float64 be aligned on an 8-byte boundary, even
when the size of native int is 32 bits.&quot;.


5. My questions:

a) Is it the intended behavior of mono on X86-32 systems that the
internal representation of struct data types uses 8-byte alignment for
double types even if this deviates from the ELF alignment rules?

b) Since the same problem happens with the 64bit integer type (&quot;long
long&quot; in C, &quot;long&quot; in C#) this would mean, that as soon as 64 bit data
types are involved, structures can never be transferred between native
code and C# using pointers to C# structures and it is strictly required
to use a technology which marshals them correctly (either using IntPtr
and Marshal.PtrToStructure or use C# classes as return values for the
native function where the marshalling seems to be done implicitly.)

c) The ECMA CLI standard recommends explicitly for float64 to use an
8-byte alignment and so the implementation seems to follow the standard
here. But what about the int64 data type? The specification states only,
that it should 4- or 8-byte aligned, &quot;[...] depending upon the target
architecture&quot; and on X86-32 systems that target architecture does not
require an 8-byte alignment for 64bit integers. Is it intended that
int64 is also 8-byte aligned?


It would be great if someone could confirm whether my findings are
correct. ;-) Thank you very much in advance!

Best regards,
Christian
