Hello Friends..................
Tomasz Kuszczak admitted Manchester United blew a golden opportunity by only
drawing at Birmingham on Saturday.
With Chelsea's visit to Hull one of seven Premier League games to fall
victim to the atrocious weather at the weekend, United knew victory at St
Andrew's would have taken them top.
Instead, they had to settle for a point as Darren Fletcher's late dismissal
cost them any chance of mounting one of those customary salvos during six
minutes of injury time..
It means Sir Alex Ferguson and his players will spend a few days in Doha
this week knowing they are once again facing an unwanted game of catch-up
with Chelsea.
'Of course it is a missed opportunity,' said Kuszczak. 'We knew how big that
game was and we were disappointed not to win.
'There is nothing to be happy about. We know what we have to do to keep up
our challenge for the title. We want to win every match, no matter who we
play.'
Thanks
