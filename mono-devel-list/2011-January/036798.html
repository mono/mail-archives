<PRE>Just as a small addition, to confirm what I said earlier concerning
situation with additional threads.

After adding 2 threads that don't actually call mono (simply register them
with mono_thread_attach(mono_get_root_domain())), I end up having:
&quot;Waiting for 2(4) threads to suspend...&quot; which mean 1 of the fully native
threads is also blocking it.

Maybe it can't detect well when threads are running in native mode?
I will continue to investigate as well.
