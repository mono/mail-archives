<PRE>Hi,

 

When pulling new remote changes you can do &quot;git pull -rebase&quot; which will
avoid the (scary, but completely harmless) merge commit git added for you (I
don't know how to do that with TortoiseGit, but I assume there is a way)

I think I messed up. Like, badly.

See this:
<A HREF="https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/22c53124ae437b2e7311f3beabd9de22d83b15db">https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/22c53124ae437b2e7311f3beabd9de22d83b15db</A>

I don't know what this merge is about (I'm its author), but it looks bad to
me.

Here's exactly what I did: I made 5 minor commits locally, double checked
everything to make sure I don't fuck (reviewing each change, comparing them
with the previous version, etc), then went on and pushed my changes to
master. The 5 commits appear fine (although I didn't expect GitHub to pick
up the date I committed them locally, as opposed to using the push date)...
but there's also this 6th change that looks nasty to me.
For what it's worth, just before pushing, I tried to pull to make sure I was
up to date, and my TortoiseGit crashed at this point. I didn't think much of
it, but now I'm wondering whether this could have a relation with this
merge.

I have no idea what I did, and am really sorry and embarrassed about this. I
very much want to contribute to the Mono project, but I guess I should step
back for now. *sigh*

Can anyone shed some light about what needs to be done? Apart from kicking
my ass.
