Rafael&gt; As for Java, if you use Sun JRE on both ends, you are fine. But using
Rafael&gt; GNU Classpath libraries with some open source VM (Kaffe, Harmony,
Rafael&gt; JamVM) at just one end you will certainly find holes as I've found in
Rafael&gt; the BigInteger class ( I've sent a patch that they accepted correcting
Rafael&gt; that bit, months ago).

Rafael&gt; The things are going to improve, as now most of the Sun library
Rafael&gt; sources were opened with GPL for version 6 and up, and so one may have
Rafael&gt; fully legal access to either use the sources as is or at least study
Rafael&gt; them to implement in a compatible way.

FWIW Sun has always documented the serialized form, at least in most
cases.  Holes in Classpath are usually just plain old bugs.
