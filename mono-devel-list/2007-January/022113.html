<PRE>Hi all,

Well, as some of you already know we are developing (we already released the 
windows version) a new version control system, using Mono/.NET.

Ok, we are currently working on a query system to &quot;expose&quot; the internal data 
model to users. Well, instead of implementing commands like:

$ cm find -version 3 -branch /main

we would prefer to provide users with something like:

$ cm select revision where revision.label = &quot;BL100&quot; and revision.branch = 
&quot;/main/subproject00&quot; and revision.date &gt; &quot;2007/01/10&quot;

Ok, to achieve it we need some sort of &quot;object model query language to SQL 
converter&quot;. We have tried NHibernate (and gentle.net) in the past, but we 
discarded it due to performance reasons (it wasn't right for the core). 
Maybe we could use it now for the query subsystem, but we are not sure about 
it.

The second option would be implementing some sort of query parser (well, 
actually implementing the query language from scratch ourselves), but we 
aren't sure about it either.

So, do you think LINQ would be better for what we need? Problem is we would 
only use it if it would be present on Mono, and I don't think this is the 
case yet... But I'm not sure is the answer anyway... Any other idea?

Thanks,

pablo
