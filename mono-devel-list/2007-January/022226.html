I don't understand what the problem is. The objective is not to have
mono .net framework class libraries be binary compatible with ms.net's
class libraries, the objective is to supply a compatible API to
support applications written for it to run in either ms.net or mono
runtimes without recompilation - essentially, for these applications
to be fully portable.

If you want to serialize and deserialize a class to send over the
network, that class can be serialized in mono and deserialized in
ms.net, as long as you are doing it to the same assembly, obviously.
What you did here is not that. And why should anyone be interested in
serializing and deserializing the .net framework class libraries?
