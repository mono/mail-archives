Welcome to the world of floating-point arithmetic unfortunately. Off the
top of my head, there are a few ways you can avoid inaccuracy; the
obvious one is to use doubles but for a game library that's probably not
a great idea. Another choice that will help is avoiding subtraction as
much as possible (negation is still ok though); division isn't too hot
either (as far as I can remember, it's been awhile since I took
Numerical Representation). Make sure to check your Dot and Cross
routines as well. 

Keep in mind too, you don't need 100% accuracy in 3D graphics, just
enough to get by; remember that you can never test for equality either,
only &quot;close-enough'ity&quot; ie (a == b) =&gt; ( (a-b) &lt; 0.00001 /* Typically
called Epsilon */). Sorry if you knew all this stuff but I just thought
I'd help out a bit

Looks like this should be handy too (from the Wikipedia page):
