Please send an email to <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">mono at novell.com</A> when/if you think you found an
security related issue within Mono.

&gt;<i>   Today while looking at the ODBC code in Mono, it occurred to me that
</I>&gt;<i> there might be a possible security problem with the way DLL maps are
</I>&gt;<i> specified in the default $prefix/etc/mono/config file. Given entries
</I>&gt;<i> like,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;dllmap dll=&quot;libxslt.dll&quot; target=&quot;libxslt.so&quot; os=&quot;!windows&quot;/&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;dllmap dll=&quot;libmySQL.dll&quot; target=&quot;libmysqlclient.so&quot; os=&quot;!windows&quot; /&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;dllmap dll=&quot;odbc32.dll&quot; target=&quot;libodbc.so&quot; os=&quot;!windows&quot;/&gt;
</I>
I don't think we'll find a single answer to all possible mapping issues
but your first case, ODBC, is probably the easiest one (for me ;-)

AFAIK libodbc copies the API from odbc32.dll from Microsoft, which is
&quot;stable&quot; in the sense that new additions (e.g. to structures) will be
binary compatible with existing structures. This is (probably) a case
where SO numbers aren't required. 

I suspect some other libraries, that want to keep an easy win32/unix
mapping, follows the same win32 rule (i.e. change the library name,
ODBC32.dll versus ODBC.dll when breaking binary compatibility).

&gt;<i> we may encounter two issues. First (not security related, just usage
</I>&gt;<i> annoyance) is that on some Linux distributions the lib*.so file won't
</I>&gt;<i> exist unless there are devel packages installed for the library in
</I>&gt;<i> question. So unless the mono library mapper automatically appends the
</I>&gt;<i> soversion to the .so name and looks for files of the lib*.so.X form,
</I>&gt;<i> the library map will fail and the corresponding managed code won't work.
</I>
I'll let someone else answer that (but I'm pretty sure you'll find this
discussed many times in the archives).

&gt;<i> Second issue, this time security related, is with the library ABI. Say
</I>&gt;<i> that managed code uses a C structure in libsome.so whose field
</I>&gt;<i> types/field order/whatnot were changed in the newer library versions,
</I>&gt;<i> which were not released when the managed code was created (for instance
</I>
	keyword: &quot;newer&quot;, &quot;not released&quot;

&gt;<i> managed code was created with libsome.so.1 being the released version,
</I>&gt;<i> while the current libsome.so symlink points to libsome.so.3 - new ABI).
</I>&gt;<i> Such situation can introduce the possibility for buffer overruns,
</I>&gt;<i> variable overwrites, stack destruction - with the smallest impact on the
</I>&gt;<i> application being segfaults. 
</I>
You're right that a bad mapping, if one exists, could lead to those
problems. Note that the same (bad) things could happen for every
p/invoke signature, offset errors, unsafe code, marshaling error... in
mono (C or C#) source code. &quot;dllmap&quot; are just one possible thing that
could go bad.

&gt;<i> If I'm talking nonsense, just lart me and
</I>&gt;<i> ignore :), but if the above is correct reasoning, then I propose to add
</I>&gt;<i> a feature to &lt;dllmap&gt; to specify the expected soversion for the map,
</I>&gt;<i> like so:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Consider only libxslt.so.1
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;dllmap dll=&quot;libxslt.dll&quot; target=&quot;libxslt.so&quot; soversion=&quot;1&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> os=&quot;!windows&quot;/&gt;
</I>
This looks identical to what we're already using for some libs, e.g.

 &lt;dllmap dll=&quot;cygwin1.dll&quot; target=&quot;libc.so.6&quot; os=&quot;!windows&quot; /&gt;

So it looks like we already deal with this (at least for some cases)

&gt;<i> 2. Consider several libxslt.so.X, in the order given
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;dllmap dll=&quot;libxslt.dll&quot; target=&quot;libxslt.so&quot; soversion=&quot;1,2,3&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> os=&quot;!windows&quot;/&gt;
</I>
I can't say (I never had to add anything to dllmap) if this is a case we
encountered (or not).

&gt;<i> 3. Consider any soversion, starting from 0 and counting upwards
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;dllmap dll=&quot;libxslt.dll&quot; target=&quot;libxslt.so&quot; soversion=&quot;any&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> os=&quot;!windows&quot;/&gt;
</I>
This looks identical to the current usage (i.e. without adding a
soversion attribute)

&gt;<i> 4. Consider any soversion within the ranges (normal comparison
</I>&gt;<i> operators could also be used - eg. &gt;4,&lt;7)
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;dllmap dll=&quot;libxslt.dll&quot; target=&quot;libxslt.so&quot; soversion=&quot;4-7,8-10&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> os=&quot;!windows&quot;/&gt;
</I>
Your sample doesn't match your description, but I think #2 already
covers it (it's unlikely we'll have so much revisions).

&gt;<i> What do you think about the idea? Does it make sense?
</I>
I think the right question should be: 

	Does adding soversion solve the *issue* ?

I'm not sure it does. First it doesn't make the dllmap future-proof so
it doesn't *solve* the case of newer, not released, (the keywords)
libraries. 

The safest *solution* is to use *very specific* (e.g. fully specified)
version numbers. No one does that because it would become a maintenance
nightmare. So we fallback to something more simpler, and hopefully,
stable.

Now I can't say if our dllmap entries are correct (precise enough) or
not. Some have a major SO version specified, some have not. I can
*guess* at some reasoning (e.g. odbc32) but I can't vouch for them.

Your idea can make &quot;more precise&quot; version numbers but I don't know if
the problem it solve (version ranges) is one Mono as encountered or not.
In the later case it doesn't solve anything ;-) at least until we need
&quot;range support&quot;.

Also note that this idea doesn't change the fact that dllmap needs, like
many things, to be correct (i.e. adding &quot;range support&quot; won't, by
itself, make me feel more secure). So adding/editing this file (to
change a version number) is a little more involving that using a text
editor!
