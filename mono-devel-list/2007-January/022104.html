<PRE>Yeah I did half have that at the back of my head when I was doing it,
I'll give it a go and see what I come up with. Also I'm thinking of
making it so it does the same when you edit a codebehind file for
.net2 as well, unless there is some reason for why it doesn't happen
now?

&lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">damien.churchill at ukplc.net</A>&gt; scribbled:

Hello Damien,
&gt;<i> This adds a watcher to pick up when a file in the App_Code folder has
</I>&gt;<i> been modified, and on modification causes a recompile. There is
</I>&gt;<i> probably a better way of doing it but I figured may as well submit
</I>&gt;<i> what i did. Feel free to rip it apart.
</I>The patch looks OK, but the reaction to any change App_Code and below
should be an application restart. And since App_Code is only one of a
whole group of folders which should application restart when changed
(the others are App_Browsers, App_GlobalResources, App_LocalResources -
an unknown number of them), it would make sense to provide a more
generic and dynamic solution which could encompass all the above
folders. I have it on my todo list, but I won't mind if you beat me to
implementing it :)
Thanks for sending the patch,

regards,

marek
