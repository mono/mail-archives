You should expect that, if you write an application that serializes
one of it's classes and then deserializes it, that regardless of which
runtime you are using (ms.net or mono), the application should be able
to do it's work. Then, if there are problems with that, the problems
should be reported, investigated and corrected as best as technically
possible to work as intended. Whether or not a certain .net class
library is binary compatible or not is not really the point here, I
should think.
