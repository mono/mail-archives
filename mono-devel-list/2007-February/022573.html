<PRE>You can use RPM to install into another prefix (base directory).
It is some option to force the installation in another location, but
if you doesn't have the needed version of that system library
(libgthread), you'll not be able to run Mono again.

Sorry, it seems you have too old a version of a distro, and Mono needs
this library and it can't be packaged with Mono, as it is shared with
thousands of other applications.

It would be much easier to ask the server admin to upgrade the distro,
or at least install the needed library (as it is a server, some admins
doesn't install it as it is a library used mainly by Gtk/Gnome apps)
or version, but as dependencies cascade easily, it would end up being
nearly a full distro upgrade done by the hardest path.

Sorry, no easy fix,
