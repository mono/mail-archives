<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> To be honest I was even once totally fed up about it:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://codicesoftware.blogspot.com/2006/10/c-as-fast-as-c.html">http://codicesoftware.blogspot.com/2006/10/c-as-fast-as-c.html</A>
</I>
It is a nice test, but you have to keep in mind that your test is
heavily I/O bound (talking to the console) and I/O tends to dominate all
other operations.

Although your test is exercising a lot of C# code behind the scenes
(UCS-2 to UTF-8 Encoding) the IO is still taking a large amount of
time.   

&gt;<i> One of our main concerns at the beginning of the Plastic project was
</I>&gt;<i> actually performance: our goal was having a multiplatform version control
</I>&gt;<i> system (you aren't multiplatform... you're not cool :-P), written in C#!!
</I>&gt;<i> So, how fast could it be? I still remember our first &quot;add&quot; operation: a
</I>&gt;<i> whole Quake 3 src repository (about 30Mb, 1300 files if I remember
</I>&gt;<i> correctly) took *just*... 11 hours!! So our concerns were even higher
</I>&gt;<i> then... :-)
</I>
The JIT performance certainly plays a role, but we have also discovered
that with managed applications memory consumption is also a big part of
the equation.  Reducing memory usage in your application with Mono will
always help your performance as well.


&gt;<i> Well, last week we run again some performance tests checking our &quot;update
</I>&gt;<i> speed&quot; (how fast you can download a certain baseline to your computer from a
</I>&gt;<i> server) against other version control systems. We didn't make any
</I>&gt;<i> optimization since our official release (November), but our results were:
</I>
Nice numbers!

This test would also be heavily IO dominated (you could also tune,
optimize and arrange your IO).

In your case, where you compare Plastic and Subversion, I would guess
that you do a lot less IO than Subversion.   

&gt;<i> Client: Acer TravelMate 370 -&gt; 1'5 GB RAM, 1'4GHz centrino's CPU
</I>&gt;<i> Server: Dell Server: a Xeon Processor with 4 GB RAM.
</I>&gt;<i> Network: 100Mbps regular LAN
</I>&gt;<i> Repository: Quake 3 source -&gt; 30 Mb, 1376 files, 66 directories
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Time to download the code -&gt; Plastic running on Mono -&gt; 11s
</I>&gt;<i>                                            -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>            -&gt; 30s
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We also checked with a much less powerful server: 1'8Ghz Pentium IV with
</I>&gt;<i> 512Mb RAM
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>                                            -&gt; Plastic -&gt; 20s
</I>&gt;<i>                                            -&gt; Subversion -&gt;  38s
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We added a 40 Mb file to the rep
</I>&gt;<i>                                           -&gt; Plastic -&gt; 24s
</I>&gt;<i>                                           -&gt; Subversion -&gt; 52 s
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, we run the tests several times to confirm the results.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, yes, you can beat C written apps on Mono! :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And yes, &quot;update&quot; is our faster operation, but we still have to improve add
</I>&gt;<i> and check in speed (running in groups).
