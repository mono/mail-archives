<PRE>Hi,

You can use either mod_mono or XSP. Actually mod_mono does not build
without XSP, so they are mostly the same when you are simply hacking
ASP.NET applications (applications here means, as compared to core
engine like HttpRuntime).

AJAX.NET assembly is likely put in &quot;olive&quot; module in svn, where
we host several post-2.0 stuff (like WF, WCF and WPF). The directory
layout is almost identical to mcs tree.

Fortunately I had some of very few code locally. Since it could be
often messy to set up build related files for new assembly,
I attached some minimum introductive source and build files in a zip
file, and assembly public key file to sign (atlas.pub, created by
our sn.exe).

You can put the files under olive/class for each assembly you hack,
and on your assembly's top directory, you can run &quot;make&quot; to build the
assembly (it will be generated under olive/class/lib/net_3_0, though
it's not really 3.0 stuff), &quot;make test&quot; to build unit tests (dll),
and &quot;make run-test&quot; to actually run the tests. And optionally &quot;make 
run-test-ondotnet&quot; to run your test under Microsoft.NET so that your
tests actually assures expected results (unless .NET behavior is not
bogus).  atlas.pub is to be put under olive/class.

(I'm not likely to work on it, so in case you use them feel free to
replace those files when you are done with your own implementation :-)

Hope this helps.
