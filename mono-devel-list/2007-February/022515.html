<PRE>Hey!

Next year is my final year in university and in the next 2 weeks I
have to come up with a &quot;Final Year Project&quot; proposal.

Initially I thought I would do the WinForms Design-Time stuff (some of
you might know I've been researching and working in this area for a
while now), but I am quite certain that I should be done with it
before the beginning of my next university year. So. currently I don't
have a clue what to come up with.

I would like to kindly ask you to share some project ideas. Think in
terms of Google SoC type of thing, but for free. :-). The idea is
going to be rated (but not marked) in the context of its Research,
Analysis, Design,  Implementation Volume and Implementation Intensity
factors and its going to be implemented starting from September 2007.
I would like to work on something that will end up being useful and
not some crappy abstract research type of thing. The more complex the
ideas is the better IMHO. I like challenges.

A bit of background info: I am not new to Mono, I've been following
the project for a while now and in theory I should be familiar with
the code base. I am a Linux user and I am also good in C.

I am looking forward to your replies, full of ideas!

Regards.
