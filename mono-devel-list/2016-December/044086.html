&gt;<i> The audit message we see is indeed by SELinux. What happens is that we cause another SIGSEGV inside the handler. Unfortunately the kernel doesn't give us any further information.

Preserving because…I just have no words. Wow.

&gt;<i> Let me go back one step. In general the signal chain looks like this on Android:

</I>&gt;<i> (3) now it's the mono runtimes handler turn, we do our business, figure out it's a native crash, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> (4) (in case we do *NOT* crash) we return to the ART handler
</I>&gt;<i> (5) the ART handler now chains into the next SIGSEGV handler, which was setup by the linker of bionic.
</I>&gt;<i> (6) the libc/bionic handler communicates with debuggerd which ptraces our process and delivers further information (e.g. register dump, native stack trace)
</I>...
&gt;<i> Looking at this, I have this conclusion: How about we do not even attempt to do a native stack trace in mono, but just let debuggerd do its business?
</I>
What do we want? The managed callstack. Yes, a SIGSEGV happened in native code, but mono is the only one that can produce a *managed* callstack leading up to the SIGSEGV, and Android certainly isn’t going to print out the managed stack frames…

My recollection is that we *don’t* reliably print the managed stack trace during native SIGSEGV. (Am I wrong?)

So long as the managed callstack is *reliably* dumped, I don’t really care what code prints the native callstack, just that we get reliable managed and native callstacks *somewhere*, preferably in some form that will make it back to Google and developers…

However, that raises an added wrinkle: IIRC, debuggerd only attaches and dumps the stack traces for *debuggable* applications (`AndroidManifest.xml` has `//application/@android:debuggable=‘true’`). This *is not true* for Release apps, meaning we might not be able to rely on debuggerd to provide native stack traces in Release apps.

Is that a problem? (Maybe?) Are native stack dumps when Release crashes something desirable? (I’d think so…?)
