BigInteger is used for RSA, DSA and DH (the later not being part of
mscorlib.dll) but SIMD itself could also be used elsewhere.

These are non-issues.

&#65279;See below for a simpler approach to the same goal ;-)

I think you got almost all the pieces correct (and they are not easy
subjects to mix together) but a few missing ones.


Facts

1. the SIMD API is not set in stone;

2. the current BigInteger API is set in stone, like all stuff in
Mono.Security.dll, because it's publicly exposed (and used). However
this does not really affect mscorlib.dll (expect from a maintenance
point of view);

3. it's likely that the SIMD code will run slower on non-SIMD platform
which are, in general, already slower architectures (at least for Mono
JIT). Making the fast, faster and the slow, slower (avoiding the later
would be nice ;-)

4. we do not want to grow mscorlib.dll with multiple implementations of
the same algorithms. Nor do we want to complexify its build (it's
already complex enough);

5. our current BigInteger is (sadly) using unsafe code - which makes it
impossible to reuse it to provide all our cryptographic code to all
Silverlight/Moonlight developers. Ideally we'll be able to remove this
(in the near future, e.g. BigInteger from .NET 4) unsafe usage, but we
definitively do not want to add more.

The *good* news is that none of this has to stop you from reaching your
stated goal :-) because the cryptographic API of the .NET framework is
plug-able - allowing you to replace almost any part of it with new ones.


So here's my suggestion:

a. Create a new assembly with your own SIMD-enabled BigInteger. From
here you can break the API as much as you want, whenever you want (or
need) [1,2,3];

b. Incrementally copy the RSA, DSA and DH code inside this assembly.
Make the (should be few) API adjustments [4];

c. Edit your machine.config file to remap the default implementation to
your SIMD assembly [3];

d. Leave mscorlib.dll alone with it's default, almost all safe,
implementations [4,5];


Optionally

x. Copy other cryptographic algorithms, like hash algorithms (SHA1 being
a good candidate since it's often used), and SIMD-enable them.

y. Make a tool that compare performance of different implementations
(e.g. see Crimson for native hash support) and edit your machine.config
automagically - making it possible for everyone to automatically use the
fastest implementation available on their own computer.

z. Enjoy them and your fame ;-)
