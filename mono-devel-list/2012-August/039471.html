<PRE>Patch #19 breaks Mono so that it's compatible with .NET's brokenness. &#160;<A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.datagridview.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.datagridview.aspx</A> says that, even though the DataGridView control inherits both ContextMenu and ContextMenuStrip properties from Control, it only supports the ContextMenuStrip property -- ContextMenu has no effect. &#160;The patch, uh, &quot;fixes&quot; this. &#160;Bleah.

Will patch #18a (to fix the&#160;OneIdlePerThread test in&#160;FormEventTest.cs) be applied?

Also, I believe I've figured out why the behavior of my table-layout changes (i.e. patch #16) differs from what .NET does, and I know that the goal is compatibility with .NET, but I think what my code does is more &quot;correct&quot;. &#160;The 3 pixel difference comes from the margin around each control. &#160;Column 0 contains a 75-pixel-wide control, so with the margin on each side, that's 81, which is the width of column 0. &#160;Column 0 also contains a 150-pixel-wide control that spans two columns, so with the margin on both sides, that's a total of 156 pixels. &#160;So column 1 only needs to be 75 pixels wide, which is what my code sets it to. &#160;.NET appears to be making columns 1 and 2 the same width for no apparent reason. &#160;That leads column 1 to be 3 pixels wider than it needs to be in order to layout the control with the proper margin on both sides. &#160;This seems to violate their own rules on layout. &#160;I have yet to figure out how to break my code in order to match
 this behavior. :-)

Finally...I take it that no one can explain how&#160;focusing/unfocusing is supposed to work in Mono under X11 (i.e. my question posed on July 29)?
