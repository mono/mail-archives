<PRE>I think i have a new bug to report, after i fix 2663's implementation, or perhaps while:

That is:  I originally fixed 2663 for the preg_match function - which was the bug reported, but in the cases where we need to evaluate more than one potential match in a string, that fix may miss some matches under similar conditions.

That is:   (A|AB|ABC)123 on string A123AB123ABC123 should in theory find three strings matching.. but i think with my fix it may miss one or more of the in between strings&#8230;  It would find a positive result on preg_match but it won't  necessarily work for multiple matches.

Ultimately, all valid alternatives will have to be tried (no short circuit on first match) and the 'next closest to beginning of string match' will have to be returned each time for each call to Eval.. At least i think so, but i haven't tested this theory yet.

I hate to report bugs in my own code, but it's been bugging me, so i'll try to see if i can fix this too if i remember.   I should file a bug report, but i don't have a good example/explanation and it's nearly midnight and i need some sleep.
