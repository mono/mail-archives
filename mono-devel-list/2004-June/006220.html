<PRE>Hi Peter,
  I think I am in the same boat as you.  Since upgrading to beta2, I have been 
running into odd behavior w/ XSP and mod_mono (and I also run gentoo).  I 
sent a note to the mono user list about this, but haven't heard anything yet.  
I tried upgrading to the latest available glibc, and still have the same 
problems.  I might try to play around with some things this weekend, but I am 
not hopeful...

  Are there any happy Gentoo folks that aren't having this odd behavior in 
beta2? (then we can compare the packages we each have installed..)

</I>&gt;<i> From discussion in #muine, it seems that *only* gentoo users are having

</I>&gt;<i> It's clearly some some subtle discrepancy in base stuff
</I>&gt;<i> (glibc/gcc/lord-knows) that has only know been exposed by some changes
</I>&gt;<i> in mono as of beta2. I've got no chance of solving this with my
</I>&gt;<i> (basically) utter lack of knowledge of these low level toolchain issues.
</I>&gt;<i> I give up. For now, it seems all gentoo users are screwed. I'm hoping
</I>&gt;<i> that 1.0 official resolves the problems, but i'm not holding my breath.
