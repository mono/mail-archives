Ugh! You're right... I don't have all of that present...

OK, this does indeed work just fine. Thanx.

I have successfully built Mono Beta 2 and installed it, and XSP. Kinda 
bizarre to see ASP.NET apps running on a Mac :)

mod_mono builds but doesn't seem to work (mod-mono-server is started, 
the named pipe is created, but requests just seem to hang at that 
point). error_log shows:

[Sat Jun  5 08:31:11 2004] [notice] Apache/1.3.29 (Darwin) 
mod_mono/0.10 PHP/4.3.2 configured -- resuming normal operations
[Sat Jun  5 08:31:11 2004] [notice] Accept mutex: flock (Default: flock)

Nothing in the access_log.

&gt;&gt;<i> Someone suggested removing Beta 1 - how do I do that?
</I>&gt;<i> You can run make uninstall from the build dir from which you installed
</I>
Ah, that would be tricky since I installed the package rather than 
doing a make / make install from source. Good to know, however.
