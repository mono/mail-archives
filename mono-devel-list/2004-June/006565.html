yes, nptl seems to be the problem (at least on gentoo).

i have problems with muine...it freezes on gentoo. i talked to someone on #muine, who also had gentoo, but without nptl. muine worked fine for him.

btw. in the times of mono-beta-1, i used muine without problems, and i had nptl.it went wrong with mono-beta-2 (and it still is freezing with mono-beta-3).

btw. using GC_DONT_GC=1 fixes the problem for me (but obviously i don't like to use for a long time an app without gc).

gabor

p.s: i'll create a bugreport on bugs.gentoo.org tomorrow (when i get to rebuild glibc without nptl, to verify that my theory is correct)
