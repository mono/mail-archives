<PRE>I think system.Windows.Forms is so important that we should do a 1.x
release as soon as SWF is ready. Most windows application programmers
are not going to be looking at Mono until SWF is ready.
I would not want a SWF release to wait more than a few weeks on anything.
Given the scope of SWF, I would not want it to hold anything else up either.

Hello,

    I will be updating the roadmap since a few things changed since we
published it.  Most importantly the .NET Framework 2.0 was pushed into
next year, so that means that most APIs that we would implement will not
be stable by the end of the year.

    We should probably plan a couple of maintenance releases (either we
continue our monthly release setup, or we delay this after August), we
should decide based on the importance of the bugs that people report. 

    The end of year release would then just add Windows.Forms, VB.NET
and C# 2.0 (without the 2.0 assemblies in stable form, as we do not know
exactly what they will be).

</PRE>
