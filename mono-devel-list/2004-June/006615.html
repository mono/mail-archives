On my G4 800 MHz it takes about 1.2 seconds to compile a small program.
Almost all of it is JIT time. If the stuff you usually compile is small,
running mcs with:
	mono -O=-all sources...
will help a bit: the same program compiles in 0.95 seconds. Of course,
with large programs -O=-all is a bad idea.
Of the .95 seconds, 0.85 are still of JIT time.

AOT compilation will reduce the overhead a lot, to at least &lt; 0.5
seconds, but it's not yet tested/supported on ppc: some people are
interested though, so expect news on that front in the next few weeks.
We'e looking at improving JIT compile time, too.
A while ago some work was done to make mcs a library you could use, but
I don't know the status of that.
