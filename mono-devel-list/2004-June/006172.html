<PRE>Hi Jackson,

The url currently doesn't work but it could be because I am hammering my connection downloading FC2 to test mono on once the FC2
package is out.

But I will test it once more after my download is complete.

To answer your question, I think for this release of rainbow we are looking to have just SQL Server support (With plans on releasing
support for other databases in the future). Right now getting rainbow fully stable (All known bugs fixed), with a few usability
improvements is our main objective. Having support for Mono and Windows would be great as it would open it up to both Mono and .Net
developers which is why I'm looking for any advice I can find.

Again thanks for the link :D

John

Hello!

Here are some of the things I encountered:

<A HREF="http://www.jacksonh.net/jackson/blog/archive/2004/Jan-29.html">http://www.jacksonh.net/jackson/blog/archive/2004/Jan-29.html</A>

Do you plan on supporting another database backend? This is where most
problems come in. Joseph did a nice job of writing postgres functions to
replace the stored procs in IBuySpy, however this wouldn't be portable
to My SQL.

The first step of supporting running on Mono and connecting to a MS SQL
server DB running on another machine shouldn't be too much work. The
second step of supporting a database that runs on Linux will be more
difficult.

Cheers,
Jackson
