<PRE>Hello everybody,

I have been following your work for a long time and I think this is really a great work.

I am using mono as 'embedded' on the windows platform. Until recently, I was compiling the source tree on the cygwin environnment and had no problem linking and using it.

- With the 0.31 version I tried the windows installer :
I had no problem with compiling my source code (include files are in this distribution) and linking against the mono library but I had this message at run time:

&quot;The assembly mscorlib.dll was not found or could not be loaded.
It should have been installed in the `c:/b/install/lib' directory.&quot;

It was not really a problem now (so I copied every mono dll in that folder) but it could be a problem in production ....

- WIth the 0.91 end beta-2, include files are not present anymore neither the libmono.a !!!

Q : Could you please put the include files and libraries back in the windows installer package ?

Q : Could you please do something so that we do not have to put the dlls in a hardcoded directory name ?

Thank you wevry much.

Didier
