<PRE>Hello,

    I will be updating the roadmap since a few things changed since we
published it.  Most importantly the .NET Framework 2.0 was pushed into
next year, so that means that most APIs that we would implement will not
be stable by the end of the year.

    We should probably plan a couple of maintenance releases (either we
continue our monthly release setup, or we delay this after August), we
should decide based on the importance of the bugs that people report. 

    The end of year release would then just add Windows.Forms, VB.NET
and C# 2.0 (without the 2.0 assemblies in stable form, as we do not know
exactly what they will be).

    We have a rough idea of what will be in 2.0 that matters, and we
should work towards that goal for the large pieces: ASP.NET 2.0 and
System.Xml and the new controls from Windows.Forms.

    ObjectSpaces are gone from the .NET 2.0 release, so it makes little
sense to work on that.   

    We also should decide on what to do about WSE2 and Indigo.

Miguel.
