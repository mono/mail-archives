<PRE>I've just built a fresh (from CVS) mcs / mono / xsp combo, and am
occasionally seeing the following message:

GC Warning: Insufficient space for /proc read


While I understand it's coming from the garbage collection library, I saw
someone else, in relation to the above message, was told to report this to
the developers of the GC library.

Well, is this quite right?  After all, the GC library seems to be modified
in the mono tree, rather than being a drop-in from someone else's code base
- so perhaps the problem needs to be dealt with locally (or both)?

After all, if mono is using a modified version, how (supposing the developer
of the GC library is advised and does impliment a fix) do changes get folded
into the GC that's part of the mono tree?

I'm not trying to pick a fight, I'm just curious how these things are done.

Many thanks,
Peter Belbin.
