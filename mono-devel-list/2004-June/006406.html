Thanks! At the moment methods and ctors are all I need, but I think I'll
need fields as well in the future (once I fix my field reflection code),
but this isn't as critical because field names are rarely overloaded. I
don't need any other tokens though.

&gt;<i> &gt; Also, if you look at the generated test.dll, you'll see 
</I>&gt;<i> that the actual
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; method token is also one off from the one reported by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MethodBuilder.GetToken().
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. Do you rely on that behaviour?
</I>
No. It was just something I noticed. My understanding is that they are
supposed to match, but I certainly don't need it.

&gt;<i> (it's easier since we keep separate arrays for ctors and 
</I>&gt;<i> normal methods).
</I>&gt;<i> In the general case the tokens won't match, because the methods of a
</I>&gt;<i> type need to be contiguous in the PE file, but with reflection you can
</I>&gt;<i> create a few mthods for a type, then for another, then for the old one
</I>&gt;<i> again and the tokesn are assigned sequentially.
</I>
I don't know anything about the PE format, so this might be a lame
suggestion, but can't you simply write them out in token order when the
assembly is saved?

Regards,
Jeroen
