<PRE>Has anyone tried this and had any success? I've found it to be quite a
trial so far.

Now, I don't claim to be any kind of Cygwin/Linux guru, but I've been
able to get alternate approaches to the point where they are not
complaining about missing packges or &quot;can't find file/command&quot;, etc.
However they fail in other ways which are not at all clear to me.

The doco resources I've been referring to so far have been: the
Compiling link on the home Mono page, an install.txt in one of the mono
dirs - which noted that the unified build process was &quot;fairly untested&quot;
under Win, and an &quot;Installing mono, mcs, and gtk-sharp from CVS on
Windows&quot; post which I think originated within this list.

What I'm after is a pointer to any definitive doco about building Mono
under WinXP that I may have missed and also some indication of whether
others have attempted this with any degree of success. 

I'll elaborate the process(es) I've gone through in summary:

Installed MS.Net 1.1 (actually already had this running with VisStudio
.Net 2003). Installed Cygwin along w/ as many packages as I could find
referred to in doco for building Mono plus referred to in messages from
the build process (such as &quot;bison not installed&quot;). So things like
libtools, GNU build utilities, gcc, pkg-config, bison, etc., etc., have
been installed. I've been through the installing Cygwin process a number
of times, slowly building up the list of required packages and things
are at the point where I'm not getting any messages about missing
packages.

When I try building mono using the mono-build-w32.sh script it downloads
the latest source from the mono CVS site and goes on to install a stack
of packages again: pkg-config, glib2, libiconv, etc. Basically the stuff
that was referred to in the resources section of the Compiling Mono
page, I think. The compilation then proceeds to issue warnings (more
than I could keep track of) and when the process ends I have an install
dir but no mono or mcs executable. I'm thinking at this point I should
only use source code as found in the Beta2 release, not the latest stuff
in case it's buggy.

I then revert to the Beta2 source for the mono and mcs dirs and try a
re-build. Result was a build process error (&quot;config.status: creating&quot;,
&quot;.infig.status: error: cannot find input file:&quot;). This doesn't occur
when I re-instate the latest CVS source. So I think at this point I've
broken my environment.

So deleting the mcs, mono and install dirs I try building Mono from a
Beta3 tarball and, after inflating all the source, it ceases operating
during &quot;./configure --prefix=/usr/local&quot; at the line &quot;checking
semaphor.h usability&quot;, but without any further error. It's proceeded
quite a way through the configure process at this point. This was after
I duplicated the glib2 files (glib-2.04-20020703.zip and
glib-dev-2.0.4-20020703.zip contents) from usr/local up to the root
level because the previous attempt had complained it couldn't find
libglib-2.0.0.dll.
