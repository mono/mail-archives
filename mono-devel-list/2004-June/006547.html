<PRE>The docs for Socket.Accept say that if Socket.Bloncking is false, then
the accept will not block and return null, but in reality it throws an
exception saying that &quot;call will block on noon-blocking socket&quot; (or
something to that effect, I don't have it in front of me at the moment).

Which is the right behaviour? I'm kinda hoping its the docs and that
currently Socket.Accept is broken, cos that'd be very nice for my app,
but hey ho if its working the way its supposed to.

Anyone know?
