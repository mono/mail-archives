<PRE>Hello,

After being fairly unsuccessful at creating a decent app to exhibit this 
behavior, I rebuilt glibc (and a few other pkgs) on my gentoo box, without 
nptl support.  Additionally, when configuring mono beta 3, I passed 
--with-nptl=no.  So far the XSP test site and my site work as they used to in 
beta1, and it has not &quot;hung&quot; on a page yet!

I am very excited that it is now working, although a little surprised, because 
I thought nptl was supposed to be transparent.  Also, no other programs (at 
least from what I have noticed) appeared to be affected by nptl.  Anyways, if 
any of the developers are looking into this, and need more info, please let 
me know, and the steps I should perform to get you this info, as this is 
quite a bit over my head.  I am very interested in understanding the real 
problem that was occuring, and would be happy to help, if at all possible.

Thanks,
  Mike
