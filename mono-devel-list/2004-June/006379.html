<PRE>Hello!

&gt;<i> Could you commit the regression tests patch in that mail as well?  They 
</I>&gt;<i> cover a lot of the fixed cases.
</I>
Oops sorry again. I missed that. Well, now I added them in my box
but MS.NET resulted in different, with some corrections. You need
to adjust UTC/non-UTC in some cases.

&gt;<i> One problem is the NoColonTimeZone test (for timezones like &quot;-0700&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> rather than &quot;-07:00&quot;) is failing.  It works with my patch on beta2, and 
</I>&gt;<i> the patch as committed looked ok (skimmed it at least), so there must be 
</I>&gt;<i> something that's changed recently around that code breaking it, now. 
</I>&gt;<i> Will look into it later this week if I can.
</I>
It didn't complain in my box. Maybe because of missing some format 
patterns? I fixed some for them. Can you check it later?

Instead, ParseNotExact fails. Its bacause I've added limitation
to non-Letter characters. It was required by some reason, but could
not remember right now ;) Will check later.

Thanks!
Atsushi Eno
