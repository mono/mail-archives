Wouldn't matter; the method's signature is defined as taking a double, 
so there's no way to avoid it getting that -657434.998999999952502.. 
number.  It's the value as given.  Even if Mono's implementation of 
FromOADate was 100% accurate (say it was implemented with GNU mp), it 
would have gotten (truncated, of course):

599264352000000000 + (-657434 * 86400000 * 10000) + (0.998999999952502 * 
86400000 * 10000)
31242239135999958.961728000000000

Casting to long, that's the exact same number as Mono currently gets for 
that test. :)

Since Microsoft's answer isn't accurate (31242239136000000), their 
implementation of the method is surely rounding at some digit place. 
That accuracy loss appears to be an undocumented 'feature', and I doubt 
it hurts Mono to leave the implementation as-is and do better than 
Microsoft in this case.
