Hello All,

It's been a while in the making but acting on behalf of the project
lead, Pieter Siegers, I am pleased to announce the launch of the
Saxon.NET - v.8.0-B port to C#.  The project page can be found
<A HREF="http://www.x2x2x.org/x2x2x/home.">http://www.x2x2x.org/x2x2x/home.</A> 

First though I would like to extend a huge amount of gratitude to Dr.
Michael Kay for the original and ongoing development of the Saxon
project.  After spending the last few weeks becoming very intimate with
the 7.9.1 and now the 8.0-B source code I have become more and more
aware at just how much effort Dr. Kay has put forth in the development
of this projects source code.  I encourage anyone who hasn't had a
chance to visit his new site, Saxonica.com, to do so as soon as you have
a chance.

After bouncing back and forth in deciding where to host the source code
and project files (Thanks DaveP for your input on this :) it was decided
that we would utilize the services of the GotDotNET workspaces for
source control and general project communication while developing our
own main project site for general reach to the masses.  This method of
setting up an open-source project doesn't seem to far off the norm and
as such we decided this to be the best route for this project.

I encourage any and all who are interested in this project to join the
Saxon.NET GotDotNET workspace. It can be accessed at
<A HREF="http://workspaces.GotDotNET.com/SaxondotNET.">http://workspaces.GotDotNET.com/SaxondotNET.</A>

With that I will leave you to your day :) 

Best regards,

&lt;M:D/&gt;
