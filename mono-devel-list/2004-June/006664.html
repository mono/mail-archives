<PRE>Well, I'm certainly willing to help.  I've got a lot of experience in
programming both VB.NET and C#, and would be glad to do whatever I can
to help.  Of course, having a legion of VB developers won't do us any
good if the build system isn't up to the task yet.  What will it take to
get this working?

I know that it would take a while to rebuild everything in VB, even just
porting the C# code will take a while.  However, it seems like a
worthwhile cause to do this so as to not pollute the C# compiler or
language with constructions necessary to create the VisualBasic
namespace.

Additionally it would create a sample library of VisualBasic code, and
probably provide a lot of feedback to the people working on the VB
compiler, to ensure that all the issues are worked out.

 The problem is I guess that more people on this list program in C#
rather
then VB.
Another problem is that the build system isn't ready yet to build VB.NET
dll's, as MBAS is not quit ready.
Besides that it would take some time to rewrite everything to VB.
I helped a bit in the implementation, but I don't know enough VB to
program
in it.

Greetz,

Wouldn't it just make more sense to implement the VB namespace in its
own language?   That's the approach Microsoft took when developing it,
and granted it might be some porting work from this point since the
class was already started in C#, but I think in the long run it would be
a wiser decision.

For all we know, there might be future changes in the future that may
require other VB specific features to properly compile that we would
have to create custom exceptions for or otherwise modify how the IL is
generated from the source code.  It seems better in my view at least to
hedge against this possible condition and implement the library in VB.

Hi,

&gt;<i> Kudos Raja, you went right to the point.

</I>&gt;<i> The problem is (besides the MonoTODO) that if C# doesn't have the

</I>
If it is just for us to implement Microsoft.VisualBasic in C#, we
probably don't need a special syntax for this.  We can have an internal
attribute named

  Microsoft.VisualBasic.Mono__DefaultValueAttribute

And either 'mcs' or ParameterBuilder.SetCustomAttribute() can handle
this
specially.  However, it won't work with CSC -- I don't see that as a
major problem, though.

If you want to provide a general facility for expressing this CIL
capability in C#, then, yeah -- it's a problem :-)
