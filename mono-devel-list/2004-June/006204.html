<PRE>Greetings:

I know that John Luke has been helping with the much needed gtk# 
installer for Windows.  Gonzalo Paniagua has already given us a Windows 
installer of Mono Beta 2.  I noticed that the Windows installer does not 
seem to add a working copy of pkg-config.exe and that mono.pc has some 
path entries that may be specific to the machine where the installer was 
put together.

I am trying to include automatic -lib: paths in the mcs invocation for 
the Make files that  prj2make generate.  I will also make use of  
pkg-config  to query the full assembly identity information (version, 
culture, etc.) so I can generate the appropriate references when 
importing MS solutions into MonoDevelop solutions.

Miguel and Mike:

I am hoping to find the correct base path for the location of the GAC 
and 1.0, 2.0, etc by querying the *.pc files of gtk-sharp and mono.  As 
you gentlemen know I have a strong windows background and in that system 
one uses the registry to look for the location of installed packages, I 
also noticed that in GNOME there is gconf which presents itself to me as 
very similar to the registry in windows.  I am not necessarily 
suggesting that we use either but rather pointing out the need for the 
&quot;one&quot; place a developer should programmatically look for the location of 
the base path to the Mono and third party Mono libraries no matter what 
platform (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, etc).

I apologize for my ignorance should this have been both decided and 
publicized since our development efforts in the GAC started.

Paco
