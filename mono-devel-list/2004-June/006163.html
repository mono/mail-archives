<PRE>Hi all,

I'm one of the co-ordinators of the rainbow portal project www.rainbowportal.net and we are currently closing bugs and looking to
get a v1 release out the door.

It would be great if we could add support for Mono as well as Microsoft's .net runtime. I know that IBUYSPY was ported over and
rainbow started off as an enhancement to IBUYSPY so it should hopefully be o.k.

The only problem is that the majority of us have little to no linux experience and don't know the mono runtime as well as we should.

Is there a document that outlined some of the problems that were encountered when porting IBUYSPY or a document of things to watch
out for when porting from .net to mono?

And if anyone who has knowledge of mono would like to help us out that too would be much appreciated as your contribution would help
add support for mono for v1.

If anyone is interested in helping out or has any form of documentation or links to articles that could help us out please let me
know by email.

Many Thanks,

John
