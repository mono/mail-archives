<PRE>Hi,

I've checked and I have gtkhtml3(+devel) version 3-3.1.4-2 installed.
This may be what is causing the problem at this end for gtk-sharp,
however, mono-winforms still won't install as it says it requires the
beta 1 package.

I'd rather not install from source at the moment for a couple of
reasons...

TTFN

Paul
