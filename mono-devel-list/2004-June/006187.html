<PRE>I can't seem to figure out how to respond within a thread ... sorry.

Another thing you MAY need for deployment on Windows (a potential gotcha):

Several/some of the really cool apps. people are developing using GTK# on
Linux use Gnome libraries.  There is Gnome # for several(?) of the Linuxes
(Linuxii?), but you'll find this note in the Gtk# list:

We don't build the gnome-sharp.dll on win32 because the C libraries it
depends on are not buildable on win32.

Alas!  Alas!  I found this a great annoyance when I was trying to use some
of the cooler published C# Linux apps. to demonstrate the ultimate intention
of Mono:  the provision of true cross-platform development and execution.  I
was eventually able to hack the Gnome dependencies out of one such app.
(Monumeric), but that was just one relatively easy case.

Which reminds me:  you'll also likely want Glade (the visual designer for
GTK#).  A lot of the cool Linux apps. utilize the Glade libraries to read
ui.glade files that define the UI at build.  Glade# is present in the GTK#
Win install.  If you want to do GTK GUI design on Win, there is a Glade/Win
installer out there ... I forget where I found it though.  


Good luck.  Hope you have lots of hair to spare!
