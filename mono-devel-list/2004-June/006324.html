</I>The basic idea is that there are a bunch of languages that all compile
to the same language of intermediate code; all the code is then executed
by the same runtime, the Common Language Runtime.

What this means is that there are all these classes, and they are
substantially the same. While a python class is radically different to a
C++ class, a C# class, a VB.net class, and a managed C++ are not so
radically different and so they can all interact.

Mono has implementations of the common language runtime and C# compiler,
with a VB.net compiler being worked on.

Unfortunately, mono does not yet support managed C++ (microsoft's .net
framework does) and I've no idea if there's a lisp implementation or
not.

Does that answer your questions? I'm not sure if it does or not, really.
