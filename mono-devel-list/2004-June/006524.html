It should be noted that this occurs only for pre-Windows XP systems. 
Windows XP doesn't depend on this feature, and has a system similar to
binfmt_misc on Linux to launch .NET programs.

No.  Mono could do this, but only for Windows systems.  Since Unix-like
systems are the primary target for Mono, it is unlikely this will be
done unless it's contributed.

Why would this work only for Windows?  File format differences.  .NET
programs use the Portable Executable (PE) format, which (conveniently)
is the same format used by all Windows executables.  Thus the normal OS
loader can be used, allowing the seamless integration.

Linux, and most other Unixes, uses ELF.  Mac OS X uses Mach-O.  Neither
of which are similar enough to PE for the normal OS loader to think that
a PE program should be passed to the normal boot loader... ;-)

Consequently, the same trick can't work off Windows, though it would
work for any OS that uses PE as the native program format, such as
ReactOS.

Linux doesn't need the same trick anyway; binfmt_misc can be used for
seamless integration, though the Wine/Mono conflict can be annoying and
needs a proper solution.  I would assume other Unixes have similar
features.
