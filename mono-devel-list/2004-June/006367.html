<PRE>The binary distribution does not include gtk# and is self contained and does
not refer to anything outside itself.

If you have gtk# installed you did that on your own and has nothing to do
with the binary distribution, you most likely have more then one mono
install then, which might explain some of your problems.

There are some well known gtk# issues, just look @ miguel's blog how he got
MonoDevelop to run...

Gtk# is such a dependency beast (about 200 very complex ones) that only few
hackers dared to tackle them; and none succeeded to make a binary self
contained Mac compliant package installer for gtk#. 

Btw: I was the first hacker that got MonoDevelop to run on the Mac and am
very aware of all your pains, but right now solving them of all Mac users is
out of my control, sorry.

But reporting bugs and issues you have with the Mac distribution here is the
right thing to do, just one note having constructive report including ways
you want it fixed is the best way to go.

hmm well i was playing with a bit, now i can run gtk# samples, but as 
you can see from the &quot;howto&quot; there's a lot to change/fix

/opt/local/lib)
