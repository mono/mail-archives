<PRE>Hi all,

This project is currently in pre-0.10 stages.  We are trying to lay the 
ground work for the work that needs to be done later.  As such we are 
trying to keep the project small so that we can work efficiently.

Because of the early nature of this project (Its been going on for maybe 
two weeks now), I really don't have much other info.  If you have any 
questions about Cocoa# please feel free to contact me and I will answer 
your questions as I can.

Thanks,

Adhamh Findlay
Maintainer/Public Face, Cocoa#

</PRE>
