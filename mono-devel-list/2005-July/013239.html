I've developed a 3D application using XML, OpenGL, DevIL, and CG in C#
for my 3D graphics class.
Garbage collection on Mono was no issue whatsoever, the program ran
VERY fast [in fact I had to add a sleep in there just to let the
processor take a break (since VSync wasn't enabled)].
I am no 'great' developer of 3D applications, so my design probably
wasn't the best, so... if you are good, then you should run into no
trouble.

The main bottlenecks of a .Net based game would be IO and the 3D rendering.
The rendering bottleneck could be reduced by using vertex buffer objects.
The IO damage could be reduced by loading up data sometime before it's
needed with the Async methods.  [.Net is great in this respect].
