<PRE>Arena Wars is a realtime strategy/shooter combination. Was released sometime 2004 I think.
There should also be some Age of Empire Clone that is supposed to be entirely managed code, but I can't remember the name, and I'm not sure it is released yet.
Of non-games a cool one might be World Wind from NASA, which is a 3D-Globe of the earth (open source). It is streaming the textures at runtime in the background from the web (and in that respect works much better than the google app)

  Hi Andreas,

  Do you know which .net commercial games exist? 

  Thanks,

  Cedric.

    As long as you don't do any &quot;stupid&quot; things a gen0 garbage collection is far
    faster than what you need for a game (MUCH shorter than 20ms)
    In fact there are at least two commercial games out there that are based on
    .net and none of them has issues getting 100++ fps.
    Also tons of 3d apps exist and none of them have any perf-issues related to
    GCing, so dont worry about the GC.

    Greets

    &gt; Dear all,
    &gt;
    &gt; Please accept my apologies if a similar question has been asked, I have 
    &gt; not been able to find a question to it.
    &gt;
    &gt; .Net is an incredible step in the interroperability of languages. Nearly 
    &gt; all software developpements can use garbage collection. Unfortunately, 
    &gt; some others cannot like game developpement. Typically, a game cannot be 
    &gt; reasonnably freezed more than 20 ms (50 frames per second). Sometimes 
    &gt; requirements are even higher.
    &gt;
    &gt; Is there a way with mono to disable garbage collection and use the old 
    &gt; desalloc model?
    &gt; Is there a way to &quot;cheat&quot; and instead of really desollocating an objet of 
    &gt; a particuliar type to put it in a garbage list. This garbage list will be 
    &gt; used for the next allocation of the same type...
    &gt;
    &gt; What are your thoughts?
    &gt;
    &gt; Thanks for your time,
    &gt;
    &gt; Cedric
    &gt;
