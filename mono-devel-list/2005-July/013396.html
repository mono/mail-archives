After some thoughts, I made some changes and all ushort tables
are gone (removed widthCompat table and made cjk* table as byte
arrays). I still have integer and char based array
(collation.tailoring.bin), but it is the smallest collation
resource - the half of it is not directly mapped (it consists of
a complex structure) and the latter half is not that big, nearly
2000 characters for now. So I don't think it is a big problem.

So I think the problems w/ managed resource are gone. But I'm
still open to make changes on the code to unmanaged one, if there
are still problems on managed resource way.
