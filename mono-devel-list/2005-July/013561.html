Please don't waste time with performance speculation. If you like
speculation, try day trading. If we were to hack up the code every time
a blind speculation was made, mono would be unmaintainable.

Disk space is cheap. I can get disk space for under $0.50 per Gigabyte.
If you want to measure performance gains, they have to be in terms of
time (reducing the number of pages read from disk: ie, show that you
save at least 1 page from being read from the disk) or memory (show that
you save at least one page of memory from being allocated due to mallocs
that you save or from being kept paged in by the OS).

I'd still like to kill all the #if NET_1_1 crap in the files and use
MonoConsts.FxVersion or something. It will save us pain in the future.
