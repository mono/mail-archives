<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> &gt; For those programs that do not require native libraries, we could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; probably generate a Mono-based installer that can use console or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Windows.Forms based installations.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I can see why this would be tempting for you but my advice is don't:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> a) You'd be rewriting what already exists, for what benefit?
</I>
Raise the bar in the state of art of Linux installation.

&gt;<i> b) Autopackage is already being used by projects, it has small but
</I>&gt;<i>     rapidly growing mindshare - it'd be nice to have some standardisation
</I>&gt;<i>     across projects so users get a consistent experience
</I>
Am thinking of something that normal users can use, not something that
copes with every possible angle of software dependencies, but going for
a simple OSX-like setup.

&gt;<i> c) Writing installers *sounds* easy, but by the time you've made it
</I>&gt;<i>     work on N^2 distros, fixed all the bugs, added digital signatures,
</I>&gt;<i>     a nice user interface, support uninstalling/upgrading native packages
</I>&gt;<i>     if they already exist etc etc, it turns out to be a lot of work.
</I>
Well, Ximian's business was largely managing software installation and
all of its related angles as part of its red carpet product, so am not
terrified by this.  

Certainly doing a general purpose tool for all kinds of software (native
c, dependencies, mix of code) is needed, and I think autopackage fits
nicely in this area.

What am suggesting is something Mono-specific for small applications
that can take care of average applications being developed.  Think about
Perl, Ruby and Python's frameworks for doing software installation: they
are not frameworks for doing *everything* but they can do a pretty good
job for *most* of their software.

&gt;<i> Autopackages are always relocatable and we provide an easy way to 
</I>&gt;<i> install stuff to $HOME if you don't have the root password. We provide 
</I>&gt;<i> simple kits you can integrate with the program to make them relocatable, 
</I>&gt;<i> as well as complete documentation on how to do it.
</I>
Such a document would be invaluable.

My feeling is that autopackage focus is in adapting existing software
which is prefix-designed to be relocatable.  Where can I find the
documents/tutorials for this?  We might want to change Mono's installer
to use something like this, as it currently breaks for 2.x uses. 

What I would like to do is break with the prefix tradition.

&gt;<i> So far we've never implemented it - it turns out that basic stuff like 
</I>&gt;<i> being able to get root on a wide variety of distributions in a fully 
</I>&gt;<i> graphical way took up all our time so far. However, it was designed from 
</I>&gt;<i> scratch to support multiple user interfaces and we already have fairly 
</I>&gt;<i> complete blueprints for not only the current wizard-style UI but also an 
</I>&gt;<i> apt-get style command line UI and a MacOS X style bundle UI.
</I>
What I care about the most with bundles is being compatible with OSX in
as much as possible.  Am talking about the file system structure, not
really the actual &quot;dmg&quot; image, ie &quot;Chess.app&quot;.

The advantage of this is that we could distribute cross-platform bundles
that would work on OSX and Linux.

The &quot;dmg&quot; problem would be handled by a mime-type handler, so am not too
worried about that.  

&gt;<i> Most software does, in my experience, even for trivial things like menu 
</I>&gt;<i> entries.
</I>
Yeah, this might have to live in a Mono.InstallationServices dll.

&gt;<i> The autopackage prototype only took a week, and that included 
</I>&gt;<i> uninstallation, verification and dependency checking. Turning it into a 
</I>&gt;<i> product took three years. There's no need to re-invent the wheel here.
</I>
Yeah, but like I said, autopackage is for seriously complicated apps;
Am thinking it more for pure Mono apps which have much less dependencies
and we can safely assume `Mono is in your path'

Miguel
