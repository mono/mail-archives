<PRE>With Mono's implementation, it's really easy to use the RSA Crypto
classes because it doesn't generate a key automatically on construction.
I'm developing an application with Windows as a target, since ATM my
family uses it and it currently has a large userbase.

I've tried out using CspParameters to store a private key for reuse
[though I don't particularly like how that key store works, I
generally prefer storing it in a location I control].
CspParams doesn't seem to offer any way to load up a public key.

Unless there's a good way to work around loading public keys into a
Csp I see a few options:
1) Use Mono's managed RSA encryption.  However, I wonder how this
compares to using the CryptoAPI for Microsoft.

2) Wrap a library like openssl for crypto.  [I might just do this to
help out Mono and for performance optimization].


As an aside... does .Net 2.0 do the foolish automatic construction
of an RSA key?  Or perhaps does it offer a constructor that would
accept RSAParameters [pretty obtuse not to offer a constructor like
that].
