<PRE>Freezes are hitting this week for the next Ubuntu release, shipping in
October.  Release schedule:
<A HREF="http://udu.wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyReleaseSchedule?highlight=%28release%29">http://udu.wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyReleaseSchedule?highlight=%28release%29</A>

You will note July 7 is upstream version freeze, meaning future version
updates require approval.  Most of the Mono stack is in a pretty good
state for Breezy, and will only need bug fixes between now and closer to
release pushed through.

Now for the bad news.  A key component of the Mono stack, Monodevelop
requires gtk-sharp2.  These bindings are also already useful in their
own right, and used by other applications.  Clearly, I would like to
ship gtk-sharp2 and Monodevelop as first-class components of Ubuntu.

As you know, the gtk-sharp2 API is unstable.  Shipping it in its current
form gives us no guarantee of software working on the stable Ubuntu
release some weeks/months later.

I've already spoken with Mike, Ben, and Miguel on IRC, but I would
appreciate any creative solutions to either API or scheduling issues
that you can come up with.

Thanks,
Brandon Hale
