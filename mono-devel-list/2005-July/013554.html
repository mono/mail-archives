These optimizations would have to be written N times where N is the
number of languages we have compilers for. With cecil we write 1
optimizer. It is like having a jit -- reduces the number of times we
need to write code.

Now, with that being said. Those of us doing optimization will probably
focus on optimizations that will result in visible speedups, rather than
random, unbenchmarked, pie-in-the-sky ideas.

Please don't bother to respond unless you have performance data on how
this change would benefit users. Showing the difference in du does not
qualify here. You would need to show:

      * What (if any) runtime data structures are avoided in normal
        execution
      * Savings in the number of pages that get paged in for an
        application with a normal workload.

I don't think we even have the tools (at least on Linux) to measure the
second item. (I've been begging rml for these ;-).
