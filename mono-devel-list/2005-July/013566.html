yes, this is done by default.

I like the &quot;currently&quot; ;-)

AFAIK you should be able to import a public key in a container. However
IIRC there are some bugs related to re-using containers (e.g. the
container and the new key must have the same key length).

&gt;<i> Unless there's a good way to work around loading public keys into a

</I>
Slower, but you probably won't notice it unless you do:
* a lot of RSA ops (which is generally a bad sign for most, non-server,
applications); or
* key generation;

&gt;<i> 2) Wrap a library like openssl for crypto.  [I might just do this to
</I>&gt;<i> help out Mono and for performance optimization].
</I>
That would be nice and, if done correctly/completely, could be used by
most existing applications without any re-compilation.

&gt;<i> As an aside... does .Net 2.0 do the foolish automatic construction
</I>&gt;<i> of an RSA key?
</I>
That was fixed a long time ago (probably even in the 1.2 preview). There
was no point to generate a new key each time you create an instance (as
was a performance killer for any server-based application).

&gt;<i>   Or perhaps does it offer a constructor that would
</I>&gt;<i> accept RSAParameters 
</I>
I'm not aware of any new constructor.

&gt;<i> [pretty obtuse not to offer a constructor like
</I>&gt;<i> that].
</I>
There are some good reasons for this but, sadly, they aren't consistent
everywhere in the Fx (so I can't be sure if this is by &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;
design ;-).

Sebastien
