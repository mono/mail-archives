I know, but it's fine: most people could esily remove them and many more
people wouldn't care less for 200 KB more. Remember, we used to inflict
20+ MB of ICU on them:-)

Yes.

&gt;<i> &gt;Don't worry about that, the runtime will load the file for you, this is

</I>&gt;<i> Does this mean that we already have such functionality in the runtime?

It can be done in two ways: embed the files in the mono binary like we do
with the char tables or load the files from where mscorlib was loaded.
Both are trivial to implement.

&gt;<i> Actually, except for CJK mapping for zh-CHS/zh-CHT/ja/ko cultures,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;locale dependent&quot; mapping data is tiny, since the largest 120KB
</I>&gt;<i> file is for InvariantCulture.
</I>&gt;<i> The latest code already ignores special CJK processing when the

</I>&gt;<i> unless the corresponding collator instance is created.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can provide minimum ASCII support resource. But I'm not sure what
</I>&gt;<i> this exactly means. For example, does it always ignore
</I>&gt;<i> CompareOptions.IgnoreWidth and CompareOptions.IgnoreKanaType?
</I>&gt;<i> (There is no full-width characters, neither is Kana, in ASCII.)
</I>
It means minimal correct support for unicode chars 0-255 in the
invariant locale (maybe plus another configurable locale that only
uses those chars). Of course if this still requires 120 KB of data it's
not worth it. If it requires 10-20 KB it would be nice to have it as
an option. But there is no hurry for this, just keep it in mind as
we may be asked to implement it.
