I think the original question isn't really productive, that's why
there's no answer.  I can think of many reasons for having a specific
IDE for C# and .NET.   I mean why vim when you have emacs?  Why have
eclipse when we have NetBeans or IdealX?  Why mono when we already have
java.  Anyway the question is non sequitor.  You can ask what the
motivations for producing monodevelop are, but not question its
existence.  Try rephrasing your question in that light.

Personally while I really like eclipse, I find it very weak in non-java
areas still.  The C/C++ plugin, for example, doesn't have the powerful
make facilities that CodeForge has, nor does it have the autoconf
capabilities that KDevelop has.  Thus for my C and C++ development,
eclipse (which is getting much better) isn't my tool of choice.  For my
current C# needs, Monodevelop fits much better than eclipse.
