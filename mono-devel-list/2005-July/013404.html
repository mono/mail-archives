Ways of working are personal things (just like text editors), so...
use these advices at your own risk ;-)
Anyway, this is what I do:

- I use the packages available for my distribution as a sort of
  &quot;stable reference&quot;, and keep them reasonably upgraded.
  I never mess with them because I use them to run the mono
  applications I really use (so I don't want them to break).
  Also, those packages install in the default places (/usr...), so
  I should be root to mess with them, which is something I don't
  like while hacking.

- I have one source tree I keep in sync with the svn repository.
  I work there, so it can (and does) break often.
  When I run configure, I specify a prefix that is local to my home
  directory, so that I never need to be root to build *and* install
  my &quot;breakable&quot; tree (all the mess is confined in my home).
  When I do a full rebuild, I typically do it cleanly in this way:
  make maintainer-clean &amp;&amp; ./autogen.sh --prefix=/home/massi/mono &amp;&amp; \
  make get-monolite-latest &amp;&amp; make EXTERNAL_MCS=false
  I also have a shell function that puts the relevant directories
  first in the PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PKG_CONFIG_PATH variables,
  something like this:
  activate_local_mono () {
  pathmunge /home/massi/mono/bin
  	ldpathmunge /home/massi/mono/lib
  	ldpathmunge /usr/lib/mozilla
  	export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/home/massi/mono/lib/pkgconfig/
  }
  (where pathmunge and ldpathmunge are other simple functions).
  So, if I want to work with the mono installed from my tree (which
  could be broken, but this is the reason why I use it!), I just have
  to execute &quot;activate_local_mono&quot;, and I know that from there on in
  that shell (and *only* that shell) I will use my unstable code.
  That way can test/debug my system installed from the svn tree.
  
- If I need to work on more than one &quot;patch&quot; at a time, I save the
  state of my tree (&quot;svn diff&quot;), reset the tree to a known state,
  and work on the the &quot;secondary&quot; patch.
  When I'm done with it, I re-reset the tree, and re-apply the saved
  patch to get back my original &quot;long term&quot; working tree.
  The &quot;hint&quot; here is that &quot;svn diff&quot; captures exactly your work, so
  it is useful to backup it and restore it later.
  Just remember to do any relevant &quot;svn add&quot;, or the diff will miss
  your new files...

Hope this helps... and if not, never mind :-)

Ciao,
  Massi
