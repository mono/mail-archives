<PRE>Hi,

I've managed to rebuild everything I had in previous FC3 installation
under FC4. To bootstrap I installed fc3 mono-core rpm, distclean &amp; build
svn tree, then removed the rpm.

Mono seems to run partially O.K. - for instance, mcs is able to build
anything, helloworld-like applications work, even gtk samples and
MonoDevelop works (actually MD only works for sure the GUI part).

There are some strange problems:
I try to run XSP or XSP2 under xsp/test but it doesn't answer the
requests. I double-checked with firefox and telnet, both dynamic (aspx)
and static contents (images, html).
Gtk-sharp was a *pain in the ass* - the svn version has a bug somewhere
that makes the gtkmoz build to fail, later MonoDevelop build to fail
too. The only solution I found was to install 1.9.5. Works fine from
what I can see.
MonoDevelop is the second pain, for some reason it starts O.K.,
creates/opens a file but, I can't create/open solutions (even empty
solution). It just stops answering, no CPU usage nor another signal of
live. No execptions.


So, I guess this is all something related to GCC 4? maybe some package I
installed from apt repository?

I only wish to know if there is any knows solutions and/or how do I
manage to find the exact problem's source...
