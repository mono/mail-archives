<PRE>Hi Marc,

I don't think it is worthy of keeping my bunch of hacky fixes
in DataView (it was short term that I touched them), unless the
newer implementation is extremely buggy. Even if it was, Kosta,
Suresh and other Mainsoft/Novell guys would fix regressions.

Lately there was a bunch of code contribution from Mainsoft and
it is on the integration way i.e. could be temporarily unstable.

So let's hope that they handle things better than before ;-)

</I>&gt;<i> while investigating DataView.cs and bugs related to it I found the history of 
</I>&gt;<i> this file to be a little weird.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First a bit of background: I work for a company that works on an industry 
</I>&gt;<i> project (GUI for an industrial laser) which will run on Portable .NET (aka 
</I>&gt;<i> dotGNU). As you might know or not, dotGNU repackages and uses a part of 
</I>&gt;<i> Mono's class library as &quot;ml-pnet&quot;. Among other classes, the complete 
</I>&gt;<i> System.Data namespace from Mono is repackaged.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We then found a bug in Mono's DataView back in fall/winter 2004, which I fixed 
</I>&gt;<i> and posted a patch. A few weeks ago we hit another bug with ml-pnet 0.7.0 
</I>&gt;<i> (more on that later), I checked out the current Mono SubVersion trunk, found 
</I>&gt;<i> the same source as back in fall/winter 2004 and fixed the very same bug. Now 
</I>&gt;<i> it turned out that the patch doesn't apply to the DataView in ml-pnet 0.7.0 
</I>&gt;<i> as that is a completely different implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While investigating this I found this weird history of this file (ISO dates):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2004-11-11: Implementation A: I fixed a bug, posted the patch.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2004-11-30: I reposted the patch
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2004-12-01: Miguel de Icaza commits the patch (r36917)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2005-02-01: Implementation B: Atsushi Enomoto &quot;mostly reimplemented&quot; DataView 
</I>&gt;<i> (r39945)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2005-05-11: dotGNU released 0.7.0, including Mono's DataView.cs 
</I>&gt;<i> (implementation B from Atsushi Enomoto, I don't know which SubVersion 
</I>&gt;<i> revision)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2005-05-16: Implementation A: Konstantin Triger overwrites DataView.cs while 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;merging the Mainsoft branch to the trunk&quot; with a version that pre-dates 
</I>&gt;<i> 2004-12-01 (i.e. over half a year old), completely reverting Atsushis 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation (r44547)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2005-07-06: I fixed the very same bug back from 2004-11-11 and posted the 
</I>&gt;<i> patch. It wasn't a applied since Konstantin was concerned that there is a 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;deeper problem&quot; with DataView.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2005-07-14: Since I noticed my patch didn't go to trunk and I reposted my 
</I>&gt;<i> patch
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So my question about the future of DataView: which implementation will be 
</I>&gt;<i> used ? Will implementation A be continued to be used in the future or will 
</I>&gt;<i> there be a revert to implementation B (the one from Atsushi Enomoto) ? E.g., 
</I>&gt;<i> do I need to bother fixing the bug in implementation B or not ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
