This may, or not, be relevant to your application but DH is for key
*agreement* not key exchange - so it's not exactly the same.

very true (but for some good reasons ;-)

better. In fact *much* better when CRT can be used (i.e. when the
private is used and all the extra information are available).

you would probably get very similar times for RSA encrypt/decrypt
operations when using a pre-generated key - i.e. this doesn't mean using
a static key!

&gt;<i> though to me, it looks pretty unsafe.  Is it?
</I>
well it would be for a key exchange - but it's not for a key
agreement ;-) however YMMV with how you're using the stuff

&gt;<i> With Static key generation, I didn't need to do any passing of
</I>&gt;<i> public key information (though it would obviously be the same w/
</I>&gt;<i> static key)... which leads me to believe that it's relatively pointless.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your help, sorry about the relativly messy train of thought.
</I>
I've more confidence in the maths behind the crypto (both for RSA and
DH) than in any software/hardware implementation of them - and MUCH more
confidence in the 'wares implementations than in (most) software using
them ;-)

So I suggest you get a good look at some crypto book like &quot;Applied
Cryptography&quot; or the more recent &quot;Practical Cryptography&quot; and/or stick
&quot;as much as possible&quot;(tm) with industry standards.

Sebastien
