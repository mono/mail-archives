<PRE>&gt;<i> Disk space is cheap. I can get disk space for under $0.50 per Gigabyte.
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to measure performance gains, they have to be in terms of
</I>&gt;<i> time (reducing the number of pages read from disk: ie, show that you
</I>&gt;<i> save at least 1 page from being read from the disk) or memory (show that
</I>&gt;<i> you save at least one page of memory from being allocated due to mallocs
</I>&gt;<i> that you save or from being kept paged in by the OS).
</I>
I belive that altough we could add some random rubbish to compiled files
like VB6 compiler does it's better not to include any unnecessary data in
files. The point of view hardware is cheap is not good I think. Users could
buy faster CPU and more RAM as well altough it is more expensive than HDD.
Saying we don't care about HDD is the same as Microsoft does and their
operating system is expanding without limits.:)

&gt;&gt;<i>From Kornel:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> BTW what about the 2.0.0.0 patch?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd still like to kill all the #if NET_1_1 crap in the files and use
</I>&gt;<i> MonoConsts.FxVersion or something. It will save us pain in the future.
</I>
In this case I would like to do some more AssemblyInfo.cs centralization
(movig common attributes to a common file and using a common set of
attributes in all the assemblies with MS.NET attributes in mind of course)
and cleanup because AssemblyInfo.cs files are a bit anarchistic currently.
And adding AssemblyFileVersion attributes to all of the assemblies with the
version you currently emit to the common MonoVersion.cs. And emit a contant
instead of AssemblyVersion attribute that can be used in a common file.

Is it OK? (I mean on OK that in addition that it meats your/our plans on
Mono it will be approved if the patch is correct, without saying that we
want to wait until next millenium or 101 other patches should be committed
before that one. Because I don't like to waste time on patches that will not
be approved in a resonable time.)
