I assume you are trying to say &quot;ignore the fact that gtk# 2.x is
unstable, just include it with md&quot;. If so, MD could just copy the .dll
files as private assemblies. Much easier (and smaller!) than bundling.

However, we are planning to ship gtk# 2.x with Mono 1.2 as a package
(like 1.0 and 1.0 were), right? It'd be a shame not to see us ship one
half of the package. All that tseng really needs is to know that by Aug.
Xth, Gtk# 2.x will be reasonably API frozen. I think its pretty clear
that 1.2 will be way before the Ubuntu final release. We just need to
make sure that we are frozen early enough so that they feel comfortable
using our code.

Imagine what kind of mess it would be if Ubuntu shipped Gtk+ 2.7.5.
That's the kind of mess we'll be facing if we make it hard for them to
ship Gtk# 2.
