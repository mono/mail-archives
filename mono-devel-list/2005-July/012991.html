<PRE>Lets make an additional clarification about what managed code is. You 
say that it's a code based an CLI + IL + GC, I'll would also add a 
&quot;Verified&quot; attribute, meaning the code is checked to not harm the system 
(stack overflow etc). I'll indicate Verified as &quot;V&quot;.

I would say that
1. CLI can be implemented as IL+GC + some parts no V.
2. GC can be implemented as IL+CLI + some parts no V.

The parts being not validated mainly lie in CPU specific code and 
pointer arithmetic. Possibly they can be even &quot;closed&quot; in special drivers.

The boot process can be made as the following: bootloader loads CLI + 
GC, jits them, start some entry point and unloads.
The bootloader itself can be a CLI+GC subset with a relevant 
&quot;application&quot; above. It can be prejitted per CPU architecture.

Konstantin Triger

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you add the extra contraint that only IL code will be executed (as in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Singularity), then the unmanaged requirements are further reduced.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But saying that an operating system can be implemented using managed code
</I>&gt;<i> only in a nonsense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course the answer depends on what do you mean on managed code. 
</I>&gt;<i> Usually it
</I>&gt;<i> means something that is based on the CLI and is in IL code. A less 
</I>&gt;<i> extensive
</I>&gt;<i> interpretation could be if you mean managed code on something that 
</I>&gt;<i> uses the
</I>&gt;<i> garbage collector. But in both situations the operating system cannot be
</I>&gt;<i> implemented in managed code as neither CLI nor GC can be based on itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The lowest level where the CLI can be implemented is the kernel. As a 
</I>&gt;<i> result
</I>&gt;<i> the kernel itself and the CLI cannot be based on themselves so they 
</I>&gt;<i> cannot
</I>&gt;<i> be in managed code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And depends on what do you mean on an operating system. If you don't
</I>&gt;<i> consider the kernel to be part of the operating system then as all the 
</I>&gt;<i> user
</I>&gt;<i> mode code can be in managed code you can say that the operating system is
</I>&gt;<i> written entirely in managed code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But the kernel is an important part of the operating system, for 
</I>&gt;<i> example if
</I>&gt;<i> you use an inefficient kernel the whole operating system will be
</I>&gt;<i> inefficient.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the world of Unix/Linux it's normal that the kernel and other 
</I>&gt;<i> componets
</I>&gt;<i> are from different vendors but this doesn't mean that any of these 
</I>&gt;<i> comonets
</I>&gt;<i> alone are operating systems, this means that the system built from this
</I>&gt;<i> components is the operating system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An operating system is a complex system that has the ability to run on a
</I>&gt;<i> computer without any other systems. This means that anything that is
</I>&gt;<i> required to run integral parts of the operating system has to be integral
</I>&gt;<i> part as well and if it's removed the operating system is not an operating
</I>&gt;<i> system anymore.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From: &quot;Richard Matthias&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">richardmatthias at gmail.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...just as skeptical as Korn&#233;l manages to take up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pages and pages of posts with their complete failure to understand how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an OS written in C# could be possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sceptical. I belive and know that an operating system can be
</I>&gt;<i> written in C# as it is a language. I only said (because I know) that it
</I>&gt;<i> cannot be implemented entirely in managed code as it requires a CLI that
</I>&gt;<i> cannot be implemented in managed code. As of the CLI has to be part of 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> operating system if you want to run it the operating system itself 
</I>&gt;<i> cannot be
</I>&gt;<i> implemented entirely in managed code even if it's only unmanaged part 
</I>&gt;<i> is the
</I>&gt;<i> CLI.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a conclusion an operating system can be implemented entirely in 
</I>&gt;<i> managed
</I>&gt;<i> code if and only if the native code that the underlaying hardware
</I>&gt;<i> understands and can execute is IL in other words when the CLI is 
</I>&gt;<i> implemented
</I>&gt;<i> at hardware level.
