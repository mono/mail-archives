Another item that I discovered as I was using the existing Crypto
framework to model after was the custom Feedback length.  I see
nothing in OpenSSL to model this, so I'm not quite sure how to
implement it.
Any ideas to fix this would be great!

Also it came to mind that the ICryptoTransform interface is somewhat
inconsistent.
The &quot;TransformBlock&quot; method uses an output buffer and the finishing
Transform doesn't, it returns a new buffer.  Since I generally
prefer working with buffers and avoiding unnecessary allocations, I
will probably setup a function that transforms the last block and
dumps it into an output buffer (but of course sticking with the
interface and offering that last method).
