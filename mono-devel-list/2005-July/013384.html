What I think is confusing for most people is that ListStore is a
flattened TreeModel, So it has to follow all the &quot;Tree-isms&quot; without a
real need for all of them.

So a ListStore.Count property is something sensible but it can't be
inherited from TreeModel, which still is the type for the
ComboBox.Model property, so some casting has to be applied, what may
fail at runtime. To aggravate that TreeModel is in truth an interface
and thus should have be renamed in GTK# as ITreeModel.

I would create a an interface IListSore like this:

public interface IListModel : ITreeModel, IList {}

That would allow common idioms like:

i = combo.Model.Count;

foreach(object item in Combo.Model) ...

Combo.Model.Add(x);
Combo.Model.Remove(x);

And have ComboBox.Model be of type IListModel and sure have ListStore
implement it instead of plain (I)TreeModel. That would make things
consistent with the base class library and so it would also make it
easier for non-Gtk-hardcores to learn GTK#.
