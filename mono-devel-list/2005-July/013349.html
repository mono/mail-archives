<PRE>Hello,

For now I took the latter approach. That means however we need some
love on the build system.

Ok then it's not difficult.

The attached patch expects those collation.*.bin files to be in
the same directory as mscorlib.dll exists.

One thing I'd note is that I could *not* build the path to those
files - I tried the same way as mono_init_internal() does to load
mscorlib.dll, but it messed NUnit test on cygwin (that expected
my_svn_repo/mono/runtime/mono/lib/1.0/*.bin instead of
my_svn_repo/mcs/class/lib/default). So I just added path argument.
