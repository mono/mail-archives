Maybe the *FILE* will be 2 kb, but the metadata added probably won't be.
To add a class with a single const we'd need to add:

1) a entry in the classes table
2) an entry in the fields table
3) a constant string in the strings heap.

At runtime, the only datastructure that will ever be allocated due to
this class is the hashtable that goes from Namespace/Class -&gt; class
field. I'm not even sure if that gets created for private classes, I'd
have to dig into the code.

The fields and string heap data gets loaded lazily on the first access.

A cecil based il-to-il optimizer could do that in the future. Of course,
if you really want to look at &quot;how can we make teh metadata smaller&quot; we
could do a simple obfuscator -- we could rename private / internal
methods/classes to have small names, etc.
