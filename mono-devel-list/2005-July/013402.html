Am somewhat confused as to why people are even able to get past the
configure stage, seeing as we have:

PKG_CHECK_MODULES(GECKO_SHARP, gecko-sharp = 0.6)

</I>
Monodoc uses gtk# 1.0 as of now. Moving to allow gecko# from head means
we have to move to gtk# 2.0

Before, we had a mode where mono-tools would build with whatever version
of gtk# was installed. However, this caused problems because:

      * As most of us are developers, we have the 2.0 stuff installed.
        That means that we compiled against 2.0. When it came time to
        release, I had to figure out what dependencies were added
      * It made the build system complicated (if gtk# 2.0 was installed
        on the jail, rpms would depend on 2.0)

So, I reverted this mode and had mono-tools build with gtk# 1.0. You are
going to need gtk# 1.0 on your computer anyways; I can't see a reason to
bring back that patch.

Now, a patch to turn this obscure error into something sensible at
configure time would be great.
