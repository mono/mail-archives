<PRE>I'm trying to evaluate key exchange algorithms for both speed,
security, and verification [S, S, V].
I was thinking of using RSA mainly, but I ran accross some info
about DiffieHellman being good for key exchange.  I plan on using
the key exchange algorithm in exchanging keys for say... Rijndael or
some other configurable algorithm.

I know a bit about RSA, but not much about DH.  I know for RSA the
key generation process is ugly (timewise), but I can't remember how
the encryption/decryption process is.
It seems DH is pretty fast, but I'm unsure as to how to configure it
properly for my needs [ S,S,V ].
In running a few tests, I found that the static key 'generation'
works pretty good, though to me, it looks pretty unsafe.  Is it?
With Static key generation, I didn't need to do any passing of
public key information (though it would obviously be the same w/
static key)... which leads me to believe that it's relatively pointless.

Also, there's 2 lengths to specify, but I don't know what really
affects what.  [As an aside, a patch to rename the length's names to
something more meaningful would be nice... I may make a patch when I
better understand how it works]

Thanks for your help, sorry about the relativly messy train of thought.
