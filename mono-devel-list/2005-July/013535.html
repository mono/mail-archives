If we merge everything into a single file we probably have about 20 consts, 
each about 50 chars long.
Depending whether this is saved in the assembly as unicode or ascii (which i 
don't know) this should be 1-2kb just for the strings in the string heap.

All the fields are NEVER used at runtime, so I hope they do not get loaded 
at all ;)
There is no access to these fields. They are only used at compile time, but 
not at runtime.

</I>
There are obfuscators out there that you can use, however that is not 
exactly what I mean:

Look at the example:

const string a = &quot;Hello &quot;;
const string b = &quot;World&quot;;

[SomeStringAttribute (a+b)]
private void Out () { }

If I understand thing right we end up having the following strings in the 
assembly:
&quot;Hello World&quot; (as part of the attribute)
&quot;Hello &quot;, &quot;World&quot; (in our case these use their own class)

However after compilation the strings &quot;Hello &quot; and &quot;World&quot; are never used 
anywhere at runtime, so we could delete them.
AFAIK not even the MS compiler is able to do that ;)
