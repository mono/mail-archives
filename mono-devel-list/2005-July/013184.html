Not really. Dllmaps could map from a &quot;virtual&quot; libc library to the real
libc. If you want to be especially clever and make the application run
on the msft runtime, the library name should be whatever the ms C
runtime is, since windows doesn't have dllmaps.

We already do this in Gtk#. One binary can run on MSFT's runtime and the
Linux runtime. Also, the data providers we have using p/invoke (eg,
sqlite) work on windows, linux and mac.


&gt;<i> Correct, but I am also writing a partial libc for a couple of

</I>
Depending on the C libraries that the application depends on is likely
acceptable when running a real world app.

By mapping calls to external libraries to DllImport's we can do some
interesting things. Imagine compiling evolution and having it run with
mono. glib/gtk+ could still be native code to enhance performance.

That being said, an issue to think about: the user might want to compile
some of the libraries they depend on with the cil targeting gcc. For
example, say you are trying to compile the `svn' binary with gcc-cil.
You might also want to compile libsvn_* with gcc-cil, but not compile
libaprutil and libxml2 with gcc-cil and just depend on the native C
libraries.


&gt;<i> &gt;Yes, I agree. However, I still need a mechanism to implement a heap.
</I>&gt;<i> Even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;porting an existing libc, that libc will need *some* mechanism to get

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;from the runtime. What is the recommended way of doing that?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think to get te better berformance you should implement heap

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This will result in a very good performance because there will be no

</I>
Looking forward (in the medium-long term), the way icalls work is going
to need to change. For a precise GC to work, we'll need to know exactly
which calls hold gc references. icalls will probably need code to
interact with safepoints. So, it would seem that something like that is
prone to break.

Also, using icalls means that you must link with libmono.so, preventing
an application from running on the msft runtime.
