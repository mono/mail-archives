<PRE>&gt;<i> Now that Mono is switching to platform-specific assemblies for the core
</I>&gt;<i> assemblies as opposed to cross-platform assemblies that work across Windows,
</I>&gt;<i> Mac and Linux (a price we pay to converge with CoreFX) it made me wonder if
</I>&gt;<i> we could not reuse instead the existing support for mixed-mode assemblies in
</I>&gt;<i> the CLR.
</I>
What you're suggesting are architecture-specific assemblies, not
platform-specific. So you would be multiplying the platform variations
by the set of architecture variations.

This would be a problem for Wine Mono's use case. Currently we can use
one set of class libraries with 32-bit and 64-bit Mono dll's. We would
need a mechanism to load some different class libraries based on
architecture.

&gt;<i> Essentially, instead of having inline assembly in the body of a method, we
</I>&gt;<i> could define entire method as inline assembly, and set the method
</I>&gt;<i> implementation flags in the ECMA metadata to be native and point to the
</I>&gt;<i> code.   It is not as flexible, but would eliminate the need for a
</I>&gt;<i> post-processor, and would merely require the C# compiler to perform the
</I>&gt;<i> assembly code generation and injection.
</I>
You would also have to extend the Mono runtime to support mixed-mode
assemblies on non-Windows platforms.
