<PRE>Miguel,

Thanks for your response. You are really preaching to the converted with
respect to how .Net runtime handling program compiled with various version
of the framework and the promotion. 

I would not have to dig around except for the annoying warning message from
mono contaminating the captured stdout result. 

Still in practice not everyone would have clean framework installation of
the latest. So for some reasons they can't use the latest and greatest.
Still it is a good practice to test the application in the framework version
one supports. I have seen some subtle differences when executed in different
auto-upgraded version in .Net/CLR.

Therefore I always want to list out what are the versions of framework
installed in the machine and is seeking if Mono has such a tool, even when
listing out version 4.0.

In Windows, I can simply look up c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework to find
out the installed frameworks as well as running clrver.exe

In Mint, at the moment I rely on the following command which I am not sure
is correct for Mono/Linux but it seems to agree with my experimentation:

find /usr/lib/mono/gac -iname &quot;system.dll&quot;

Thanks.

MarL
