Subject: I'm realizing this now

When most everyone I encounter describes it as  &quot;abstract&quot; and &quot;makes no sense&quot;, kinda indicates those people &quot;don't get it&quot;. 

And,  Jesus  Christ, just  because I said it went  over folks heads doesn't  mean I  meant  it went over the heads of everyone who disliked it.

Edit: You know what? The way I phrased my initial  post could easily be seen as  a general statement directed towards everyone who didn't like it and that's my  mistake. I made it sound like a  gross  generalization, and I didn't intend to  do that. I'm also  sorry for my knee-jerk reply. It sounds  immature and I clearly  said the second part in a way  to taunt and mock you. I'm  sorry.
