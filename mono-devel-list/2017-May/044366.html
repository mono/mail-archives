<PRE>Hello,

If this sounds like a Deja Vu please excuse me as my search does not review
an answer to my question.

I am running/developing mono application in Linux Mint 17.3 (64-bit)

I know how to find out which version of mono I am using. I simply use mono
--version. I have two VM's of identical Linux Mint but one is running mono
version 5.0 while another running mono 3.2.8.

I have a hello world test console application built in MonoDevelop compiled
to Mono/.Net 2.0. I have used monodis on the executable to make sure it is
built to framework 2.0.

In the VM running 5.0, it does not seem to have framework 2.0 supported
install. The only framework is v4.0 and hence when I run that test program
it generate this message:
WARNING: The runtime version supported by this application is unavailable.
Using default runtime: v4.0.30319

Realizing that VM does not other framework versions installed, the loader
forces the program to run with framework 4 and then writing that warning
message to stdout. To silent this one simply include the supportedRuntime
element in the config file with version &quot;v4.0.30319&quot;.

The question is:
How can I find out what versions of framework are installed and supported in
the machine?

In Windows VS has a tool called *clrver.exe*  which lists out all the
framework installed and available in the machine. Is there a similar tool in
Linux mono? If not how can I find out the hard way?

When I run the test program in the vm with mono 3.2.8 (which to me appears
to have lots of stuff in /usr/lib/mono including v2.0 supports), I can
dispense the config file and it is then using the v2 framework, the version
it is built with.

But if I include:
&lt;startup&gt;
		&lt;supportedRuntime version=&quot;v2.0.50727&quot;/&gt; 
		&lt;supportedRuntime version=&quot;4.0.30319&quot;/&gt; 
&lt;/startup&gt;  

in my config file, I can force that test program to run in v2.0. and if I
rotate the order, I can force the app to run in v4.0. Hence obviously the VM
with 3.2.8 contains supports for both v2 and v4 framework.

Is there a tool to list out the framework version that a machine supports?

Thanks.

MarL
