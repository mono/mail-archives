<PRE>Hello,
      I am looking to work on xbuild a bit, and so I started by looking at
the the current tests and planned on writing some more.

It looks like there are a substantial number of tests (18) marked NotDotNet.
Is there a reason we'd have this many tests that don't work on .Net?

Also, some other tests not marked with NotDotNet are failing on .Net? Can I
assume the tests are wrong if they are failing on .Net?

The documentation for MSBuild on MSDN is a bit sparse. Is there any other
source of information other than writing tests?

Finally, I am trying to work on this in VS and MonoDevelop. Does anyone have
any guidlines on setting up projects for mcs/class type assemblies? My goal
is to be able to have projects for MSBuild.* and the xbuild assemblies in a
solution, and be able to build run them. However, I believe when I run my
locally built xbuild it will load the MSBuild.* assemblies out of the GAC,
rather than my locally built ones. Also, xbuild locates Task files based
upon a mono install layout structure. Any advice for working around these
issues? I basically am looking for make run type functionality like
MonoDevelop has.

Thanks,
Jonathan
