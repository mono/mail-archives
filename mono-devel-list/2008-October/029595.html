&gt;&gt;<i> I'm having a bit of trouble compiling mono on Windows (using CygWin). 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> weird thing is that the compilation seems to have gone ok, but the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mono/mcs/gmcs programs do nothing afterwards.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This usually happens when a dll needed by the executable (most likely
</I>&gt;<i>libglib.dll or something like that) is not in the PATH.
</I>
Thanks for the tip!

Is there a way that I can find out what .DLLs it's missing?  

I have a really old copy of a Windows Dependency Walker (DEPENDS.EXE), which
claims that I&quot;ve got all the .DLLs that I need, but mono -V still does
nothing.  (Also - Depends.exe said that I was missing INTL.DLL, which was
definitely not in the same bin directory as mono.exe - if this is actually
required, shouldn't it have been built in the compilation process?)

Even having a list of .DLLs from a text file (maybe a file that make uses)
would be a great help!



Also - are there any post-build verification (unit) tests that I can run, in
order to double-check that my build actually went ok?


Again - thank you (all) very much for the help - sorry for asking such
newbie questions :)

Thanks!
