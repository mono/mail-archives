<PRE>Someone (I'm not at liberty to say exactly who at the moment) needs  
information about Microsoft patent risks involved in using Mono for  
development of commercial software.  Specific concerns include the  
System.* classes.

I'm not saying that Mono is bad, or that the risks are real or dire.   
I don't want to start a big discussion on the list.  We just need to  
make contact with someone who can tell us what the patent risks really  
are from the Mono project's perspective.  What is known, what is  
unknown, and what has been worked around.

We need someone who can speak with reasonable authority about the  
matter.  Not just random opinions.  Who would be the best person at  
Novell or the Mono project to ask about this?

Thanks!
</PRE>
