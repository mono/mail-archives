<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; The Java community has JSS.  Would asking for a MonoSS be asking too
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; much?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It depends from who you're asking ;-)
</I>
Think of me as an ISV that wants to produce applications for the US
government.  The entire federal government including DoD is mandated to
use FIPS compliant crypto libraries.  
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Network Security Services for Java (JSS) is provided by Mozilla. So
</I>yes
&gt;<i> Mozilla *could* do something like this (not Mono-specific but for
</I>&gt;<i> all .NET users) just like they provide the API for Java.
</I>
OK.  Today the picture is a little different.  Red Hat produced Python
bindings <A HREF="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/PythonNSS">https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/PythonNSS</A> .  These will
be in fedora 10.  And someone is producing Perl bindings
<A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/~claesjac/Crypt-NSS-0.03/lib/Crypt/NSS.pm">http://search.cpan.org/~claesjac/Crypt-NSS-0.03/lib/Crypt/NSS.pm</A>

Making Mono and SuSE second class citizens in this realm.

&gt;<i> However I don't think this (NSS) should ever become a direct(*) Mono
</I>&gt;<i> goal(**). Mono itself has already too many things to complete to
</I>afford
&gt;<i> a duplicate effort (since we already offer the same features).
</I>
I am going to show my inexperience so please don't get upset when you
tell me it is not so simple.  Is there not a way to automatically
generate a bunch of C# stubs based on the C headers?

&gt;<i> Besides NSS there are other FIPS140 certified libraries that could be
</I>&gt;<i> wrapped to give the same end result. However I don't know any
</I>available
&gt;<i> on Linux that have .NET binding.
</I>
If you are thinking of OpenSSL it is not as attractive (neither as
current nor Level 2 certified) as NSS.  If you are thinking of CryptoAPI
it is a Windows only technology.  I like NSS because it is cross
platform (on top of NSPR) and certified to the teeth.

Btw, will Crimson come out of hibernation?

Thanks,

Vlad
