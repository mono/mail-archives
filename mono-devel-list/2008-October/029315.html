I did post some suggestions already that you haven't reported back on...

* Use --with-sigaltstack=no - it tried to use it on my boxes and  
crashed at runtime
* Try without libgc - if you don't want to try vanilla Boehm GC, use -- 
with-gc=none (it's the only way to rule out the GC as source of errors)
* Rename Sun's `mcs` executable (Modular... whatever) or remove it  
from $PATH so that it's not detected in the first place

You can use monolite, I did so myself on Solarises. You can't get it  
to work however because in your configuration the Mono runtime crashes  
while trying to execute mcs.exe from monolite to compile basic-profile- 
check.exe. Copying over assemblies from elsewhere or compiling new  
assemblies with an old runtime will not fix your new runtime. Trust  
me, you do need to recompile the runtime with some set of options that  
makes it work. If you don't want to play with those options, then  
please don't complain. ;)
