</I>Paolo has a good point, the mono team has other priorities, but if someone
is willing to take up on bringing the interpreter back, just say so and we
will
sure give help and review the code.

And if the idea is to have a small footprint interpreter, then ruling out
CLR 2.0
would be advisable, as generics impose a significant footprint in terms of
binary
and runtime size.


Cheers,
Rodrigo
