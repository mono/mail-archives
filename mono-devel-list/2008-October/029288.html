The mono interpreter already operated on a different internal
representation, not on IL code directly, so it's not jit-fast,
but still not as slow as Rodrigo would imply with his message.

The main issue is that a few people showed interest in bringing the
intepreter back to life, saying it was important to them, but they never
dedicated 1 man hour to the task (or if they did, they didn't share the
code).

So, if those people that claim an interpreter is importnat didn't dedicate
1 man hour, why should we? (Note I'm not pointing figers to anyone here,
several people wanted an interpreter but were unwilling to spend
anything on it, money, man hours or anything else except email
postings:).
