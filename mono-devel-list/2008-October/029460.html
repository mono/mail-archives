Well, I'm rather afraid of having Mono.Messaging base API dependent
on Rabbit (by &quot;dependent&quot; I don't mean that Mono.Messaging.dll has
reference to Mono.Messaging.RabbitMQ.dll). AMQP solution might not
be chosen if it lacks significant functionality, but that does not
mean it is no-go. If Rabbit based implementation does not work here,
I rather assume nothing would work fine here ;)

&gt;<i>      BTW do you know if AMQP/Rabbit is going to support message peek

</I>&gt;<i>     and receive-by-id functionality (in some milestones), as you

</I>&gt;<i> I had a chat with one of the standards committee members at a conference 
</I>&gt;<i> around the end of April.  Selectors (to support ReceiveById) are

</I>&gt;<i> (that's compatible with Apache QPid) to support it.  Queue browsers are

</I>&gt;<i> queue discovery, AMQP uses a declare model, i.e. all queues exist, but 
</I>&gt;<i> its not possible to find what they're called.  Queue discovery is being

</I>
OK. If Rabbit .NET binding supports such extensions, you could simply
use them. The binding does not have to be limited to AMQP (still might
be better to have Rabbit/Qpid bindings based on AMQP binding based on
Mono.Messaging though).
