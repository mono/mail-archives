<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> &gt; The above is actually a really good reason why we do not spend more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cycles on Solaris/SPARC.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The machines are overpriced, and underperforming.  It is like buying an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; iPhone, just not as useful.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> This is the most stupid thing I've seen in a while.  Go to a bank and 
</I>&gt;<i> take a look in the
</I>&gt;<i> datacentre. Hurry, before they go out of business. :-(
</I>
Well, maybe banks should not have been buying overpriced stuff, like
debt, or SPARC computers.

We do support it, and I wish we could do more, because I do like the
SPARC architecture, but with its current pricing I have zero desire on
buying more overpriced slow hardware.

But if people want to donate expensive SPARC computers to the project,
we could certainly use them.

&gt;<i> This is a question of user need vs developer convenience. I think your 
</I>&gt;<i> attitude is
</I>&gt;<i> inappropriate if you want to push Mono as a realistic alternative to 
</I>&gt;<i> Java.  Which
</I>&gt;<i> does work rather well on Solaris.
</I>
You are under the mistaken impression that our goal is to replace other
technologies.   We are not trying to compete with Java, if you are happy
with Java, keep using Java.   And if you are happy with Ruby, or Python,
or C++, more power to you.

We are offering a platform that might suit some people, and we are
trying to maximize developer pleasure and enjoyment when they write and
maintain software.



</PRE>
