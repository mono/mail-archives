<PRE>
This is my first post, but I already need some experts advise :)

We are evaluating to port an existing app (written in c/c++, for
LINUX/Windows/Mac) to mono. The basic pattern is a daemon-based system
(using pthreads, epoll) that will dispatch data to various embedded
scripting engines (PHP, Tcl, Perl, etc.). Currently the engines will have
one-time startup and shutdown methods and the system will pre-create
numerous threads. The daemon will then notify the workers to do their work.

In the planed scenario the daemon should be written in mono whereas the
scripting-engines needs to have unmanaged wrappers.

As I understood mono is using phreads and epoll, so having created a
&quot;mono&quot;-thread and using this thread to call an unmanged piece of code, will
this unmanaged code be run in the context of the underlaying pthread? Or
does the mono i/o layer call the unmanaged code with its own thread pool?

thx for you help
