<PRE>Before I begin, I must say that I am quite a novice when it comes to
Linux, so I could quite possibly have made a trivial mistake somewhere.

 

My machine is running the 64-bit version of Ubuntu (installed using
Wubi). However, I would like to run the latest release candidate of Mono
2.0 under 32-bit as the programs that I am running are not compatible
with 64-bit Mono.

 

I have obtained the sources and managed to compile 64-bit without any
problems by just running the following commands:

 

./configure

make

make install

 

When I run &quot;mono -V&quot;, it says that I am running on amd64 architecture.

 

So I assume the way I would run my programs under 32-bit is by cross
compiling for x86. To do this, I first try running the 'configure'
command with the following syntax:

 

./configure --host=i386-pc-linux --build=x86_64-pc-linux

 

However, this fails to complete successfully, and produces the following
output (I've attached the 'config.log'):

 

Checking for preceeding underscore in symbols... configure: error:
cannot run test program while cross compiling

 

I also tried running the following command:

 

                ./configure --target=i386-pc-linux

 

This was successful, and I managed to compile and install. However, when
I run mono it still says I am running under amd64.

 

Any help would be greatly appreciated,

 

Thanks,

 

James Bird.
