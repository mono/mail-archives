Please, try to consider what real users do, and what sort of 
heterogeneous systems they
actually have.  I'd wager that there are a lot more SPARC/Solaris 
systems deployed to
live than there are AMD/Solaris, and where new SPARC systems are being 
deployed
they are generally rather important.

That'll change, and we'll get to the point where the  SPARC systems are 
database engines
rather than application engines first.  But the reality is that Solaris 
shops tend to be
conservative.

And no, I'm not disagreeing that x86 doesn't give more bang for the buck 
for CPU
grunt.  That's not the point at all. SPARC might be slow(ish) but its 
not broke.

This is a question of user need vs developer convenience. I think your 
attitude is
inappropriate if you want to push Mono as a realistic alternative to 
Java.  Which
does work rather well on Solaris.
