<PRE>Our module can run for weeks but then crashes...always in serializing of a
class to a class to XML. We can perform the same serialisation operation
over a million times, but then it crash within one. Try/Catch traps see
nothing. This leads us to think the issue is much deeper in mono.

We have a mono service that manages a state engine that can manage several
entity types and hundreds of entities instances that can change state every
few seconds. Periodically the engine takes some snapshot statistics and
does two things with the statistics. It:
a) streams them them to a socket
b) writes them to a file.

To prepare the stats for these operations they are placed in one of several
collections and these collections are serialized. When the system is busy
it can average to about 10 to 20 serialization operations per second.
We have optimized the code to persist the serialization objects for each
collection class. This improves performance in mono, but did not affect the
incidence of the issue. In development when we (accidently) created issues
that caused genuine serialization exceptions we caught them so we know out
exception catching works...Our logging tells us that &quot;serialization is
starting&quot; but on crash we see no &quot;serialisation done&quot; message.


Anyone have any ideas? Does/has anyone else seen this.
