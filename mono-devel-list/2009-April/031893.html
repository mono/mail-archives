<PRE>Hi Alberto, you may want to try this out if GAPI does not work out for you:

Pinvoke Interop Assistant works much like GAPI: It will parse header files and generate the Pinvokes for you. It's not perfect, but it worked well enough for me when I ran it through OpenGL's gl.h file to import a few hundred methods. (I took care of the errors with some regex replaces and manual tweaking)

Hi all, I hope this is the right list for this kind of questions.

I have a GObject-based library, written in C, which I want to use from a C#
application (f-spot). I generated the bindings with the GAPI tools, but I'm
not satisfied with the result. The problem is that the C API for that
GObject provides a method that is called my_object_new(), which simply calls
g_object_new() with the proper arguments. But the object supports many other
construct-only properties, which I want to set from the C# application, and
apparently I cannot, because the GAPI tools only generated one constructor
which takes no parameters.
I guess that by modifying the C library by adding more _new() methods I can
get more constructors in the C# API, but is there some other way around it,
without modifying the C API?

TIA!
  Alberto
