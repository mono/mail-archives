That's a possibility.  Do you know what configure switch would do that?

</I>
Sure.  So if you have a problem compiling mono itself and the rpm guys
are getting mono itself to compile on the platform you're interested in,
you should take a look at what they're doing.  You can see what sequence
of commands they're using to compike, what configure options they're
giving, and what patches they're applying.  Then you can make sure you
don't apply whatever it is that's causing mono-debugger to malfunction
while finding out how they are able to build.

&gt;&gt;<i> I've just finished building mono-2.4 for Fedora-11 which might have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> additional things that are necessary if you're building from mono's trunk.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, this is a question about the mscorlib problem compiling 
</I>&gt;<i> mono, I'm pretty tired about the fedora support for mono, so please

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I'm not doing that at all.  I'm telling you -- if you have a problem
compiling the mono package on Fedora; there's a repeatable recipe for
getting mono to compile on Fedora in existence.  Comparing it to what
you're doing will help you find out what you're missing.

BTW, if you get this to work, the monodevelop packager in Fedora would
likely be interested in a bug report.  If the problem is a configure
switch to the mono build, you can email me and I'll get it in.
