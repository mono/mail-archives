</I>Hi Paul:

(Sorry for the  top-posting don't know way my mail client errase the 
previous messages when the mail is from you Paul...)

I'm trying to build from sources a parallel environment becouse the 
rawhide mono/MD RPM's don't have the MD debugger addins witch are the 
features that I need!!


And yeap I also try to build just MD with the debbuger addins enable 
using the mono RPM's for rawhide (2.4-15.1.RC1.fc11) ..but as I post on 
the MD mailinglist trying to use the debugger addins, I get a :
## DebuggerServer started
EXCEPTION: Mono.Debugger.TargetException: Unsupported `mono' executable: 
/usr/bin/mono


So, currently I don't know what else to do to get this thing to work on 
Fedora 10!!!, compiling just MD work with installed mono RPM's but the 
debugger don't work, compiling also mono from sources also crash (as in 
last post it seems that the problem is not specific to the missing 
mscorlib, compiling mono from sources is making mono runtime to crash 
sometimes...)

When you say &quot;Have you built the 2.0 version of MD? IIRC&quot;, build MD IIRC?



....what can I do??

Thanks

Mauricio
