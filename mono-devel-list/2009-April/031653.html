<PRE>&gt;<i> The sizes of the mscorlib assemblies are as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> 1.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2.0M
</I>&gt;<i> 2.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2.5M
</I>&gt;<i> Silverlight &#160; &#160; 2.1M
</I>
Assembly sizes is one thing (we don't care about those that much on iPhone).

The &quot;real deal&quot; is how large is fully AOT'ed version. 2.0/Silverlight
profiles do not support full AOT yet (or do they already?), so that's
one problem. Another potential problem is that generics might produce
large AOT'ed code (that's just my guess).

Why this matters? Because with iPhone, you really want to keep your
applications below 10 megabytes (then the user can purchase it via
3G). Additionally, Apple does some encryption of all code that goes
into the application, so in the end code is actually not compressible
(data is, but AOT produces code).

Right now with 1.0 profile on the iPhone we have to do some very heavy
stripping to go below 10 MB (that's in total, i.e. Mono + AOT'ed
assemblies + Unity engine + PhysX + ... + actual game data). But Mono
is a large part of that.

The runtime memory footprint is quite important as well, but with
iPhone the major problem is AOT'ed code size.
