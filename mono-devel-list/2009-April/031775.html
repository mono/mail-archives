If fedora doesn't like static libs, you can omit them from the package, while
still building them.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Zoltan

Hi,

The package I've just built for Fedora does this (links /usr/bin/mono against
the static libmono.a and then removes the static libraries prior to finishing
the package).  The concern I have with this strategy long-term is that programs
wanting to embed the mono runtime will be linking against the dynamic
libmono.so.  If this is causing issues for /usr/bin/mono and we don't know what
the trigger is, isn't this a potential problem for them as well?

Note that I'm not a mono user, I'm just jumping in to make sure we get mono-2.4
packaged in time for the next release.  So feel free to correct me if I
misunderstand something :-).
