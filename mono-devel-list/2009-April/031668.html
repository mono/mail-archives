</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In fact, I was really surprised that it was complaining about not

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;qualified&quot; (or whatever) name, which includes the Version=1.0.0.0,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PublicKeyToken=XXX, et al. Cecil seems to just try name + &quot;.dll&quot; and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> name + &quot;.exe&quot;, which obviously won't work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It should work...within reason, as the qualified assembly name will  
</I>&gt;<i> (by
</I>&gt;<i> necessity) include the file's base name, e.g. 'mscorlib,
</I>&gt;<i> Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089'  
</I>&gt;<i> must
</I>&gt;<i> be located within an assembly having 'mscorlib' as the basename.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, that (obviously) can't be the only check -- after finding an
</I>&gt;<i> assembly with a matching basename it'll need to check that the  
</I>&gt;<i> version,
</I>&gt;<i> culture, and PublicKeyToken of the found assembly are correct (and if
</I>&gt;<i> not correct continue looking for the next one), but as a start it  
</I>&gt;<i> should
</I>&gt;<i> be fine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which leads to the next question: where is 'foo.dll' located?  In a  
</I>&gt;<i> path
</I>&gt;<i> on the command line, e.g. 'mdoc update path/to/foo.dll'?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
foo.dll is in the directory bin/Debug, and so is the assembly I'm  
documenting (call it bar.dll), which depends on foo.dll.

&gt;<i> Or is foo.dll in the GAC?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or is foo.dll in MONO_PATH, e.g. 'MONO_PATH=/tmp mdoc update ...'?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the first two cases (command line and GAC), Cecil *should* be
</I>&gt;<i> finding the assembly (otherwise we couldn't resolve IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; and
</I>&gt;<i> other mscorlib types, and I know I fixed a bug related to the first  
</I>&gt;<i> case
</I>&gt;<i> that the Gendarme build process was encountering).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MONO_PATH, as mentioned before, isn't currently supported (as it  
</I>&gt;<i> hadn't
</I>&gt;<i> even occurred to me to support it).  If 'foo.dll' is in MONO_PATH,  
</I>&gt;<i> could
</I>&gt;<i> you try using the patch I applied to the previous email and see if  
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> fixes the issue?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I don't think that will fix it &#8212; I dug around with mdb and it looks  
like the assembly resolver being used (a DefaultAssemblyResolver) only  
has the default directories in the search path, &quot;.&quot; and &quot;bin&quot;. The  
directory `foo.dll' (along with everything else) is in, bin/Debug,  
doesn't get added to that resolver. It's a different object than the  
one that AddSearchDirectory is called on in monodocer.cs.

Thanks.
