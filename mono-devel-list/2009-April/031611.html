<PRE>Well done so far Keerthi.

&gt;<i> Hello Rafael,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for the late reply. It took me quite a day learning the inner details
</I>&gt;<i> and workings of the entire azure framework.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I went through the actual process of developing an app and deploying
</I>&gt;<i> in the cloud. Sorry for boring you with all this technical stuff. it works
</I>&gt;<i> like this.
</I>&gt;<i> In the cloud, they have this storage and processing. And in the documents,
</I>&gt;<i> it says you can't have a debugger in the cloud. So development had to be in
</I>&gt;<i> the desktop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And they have this simulated cloud environment for the desktop - which
</I>&gt;<i> consists of the STORAGE(queue,blob,tables), SERVICES(starting and stopping
</I>&gt;<i> and service related stuff), and couple of command line tools to move the
</I>&gt;<i> developed soultion to the cloud.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the actual cloud they do have all these APIs for storage, and the ones
</I>&gt;<i> you said web-facing synch process and background async process and all that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So to bring real value to the Mono and linux user, it makes sense to first
</I>&gt;<i> simulate the cloud environment at the desktop. So if we are able to develop
</I>&gt;<i> the application(simulate) at the desktop level using mono, the cloud bases
</I>&gt;<i> apis which would be developed at the next stage and it would help the
</I>&gt;<i> desktop application to move to the cloud. The moving to the cloud is all
</I>&gt;<i> browser based and so intuitive  - ie if we get the desktop app to work, you
</I>&gt;<i> can easily port it to the cloud.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I think the best way for me is to start implementing the desktop based
</I>&gt;<i> simulation of the cloud. So how to approach?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i) Services part - The azure actually configures IIS 7.0 to emulate the
</I>&gt;<i> cloud based envi at the desktop level. It need to have WCF Http activation
</I>&gt;<i> and asp.net 2.0. So I have to work with Apache regarding this I guess and
</I>&gt;<i> lot of coding
</I>

You can leverage mod_mono here, but as I said worker processes tend to need
an specialized container.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ii) Storage part - They simulate the cloud based storage (blob,tables) at
</I>&gt;<i> the desktop level using SQL server with limited functionality ie no https,
</I>&gt;<i> not too much scale.Is it Mysql on our part? and intensive low level coding
</I>

Keep storage details abstract, for instance using NHibernate/ActiveRecord to
hide which database is being used. No need to restrict it to MySQL or
PostgreSQL, Even SQLite can be a viable alternative for this simulation.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> iii) And I have to look at the command line tools for porting the dsktop
</I>&gt;<i> appln to the cloud( Still haven't figured out the inner details
</I>

That seem to be easy IF YOU HAVE THE CLOUD, or at least it's protocol specs.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> iv) And finally the UI part, showing the user the simulation like how many
</I>&gt;<i> instances of an application are currenly running and if possible having the
</I>&gt;<i> project as part of a template( like including the necessary config and xml
</I>&gt;<i> files)
</I>

This may even be a separate project, as it can be complex.
I think that we would be better served to have the UI hosted as an addin in
Monodevelop as well as the services, to integrate with the debugger.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These four features are the intial milestones of the big project I think
</I>&gt;<i> and which I can specify in the proposal I guess.
</I>&gt;<i> Please let me know, whether this is viable and could you be my mentor, if
</I>&gt;<i> possible?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It still looks like something a bit bigger than what GSOC time-slot would
accomodate, but it may be good to propose.

And, no I can't be your tutor, as I don't have the time and skills needed to
to play well that important role.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for helping me out,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes you can model  part of the per-node runtime for the processes after
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> asp.net, but remember that typically they separate the processing in two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parts: the web-facing synchronous process (similar to ASP.NET) and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> background asynchronous process which needs a much simpler container.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Keep counting, two services/daemons until now, not accounting for needed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> redundancy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also the queues, and blobs have to be managed in separate containers, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also failure/performance monitoring and load balancing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We are talking here of at least half-a-dozen services/deamons per node.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Each one with specific requirements, most of them not so similar to an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> asp.net container (for that part you can take a look at our xsp/mod_mono
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> code, that have some startup code and then rely on a library that implements
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> most of the asp.net host logic).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also you'll need to determine which protocol all those pieces will use to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interact with each other, as AFAIK those are blackboxed in Azzure. Remoting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is a possibility but it doesn't deal easily with dynamic redirection as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> needed for the 'cloud', in that regard even WCF needs to be trubo-charged to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be able to be used in such scenario, and beware, mono still doesn't have a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> full implementation of WCF.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But go ahead Keerthi, explore the issues a bit more, look at our code and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> come back with more specific questions, we'l be glad to answer.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But I'm quite sure it is too big a project for GSOC, you'll need to find a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> smaller part of it to propose and see if someone here can be your tutor.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Enjoy,

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hello Everyone,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I want to know, whether we have already or in future have plans of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> implementing windows azure services( cloud based platform) as part of Mono.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I developed an application with Azure( based on .net 3.5 sp1). It ran
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> without any issues with MOMA. But when I tried it with Mono develop, it says

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> apis.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So I thought, it would help the mono and suse community immensely if I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> try implementing the APIs with regard to the azure services.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The azure runtime environment seems similar to ASP.net( with the xml
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> config files).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It would be very helpful, if you could let me know whether this is a
