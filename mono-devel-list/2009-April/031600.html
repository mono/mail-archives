<PRE>I've not experimented with the CTP (I am still bound to VS2005).

I've just read a bit about the architecture, and the developer experience
inside newer VSes.

Yes you can model  part of the per-node runtime for the processes after
asp.net, but remember that typically they separate the processing in two
parts: the web-facing synchronous process (similar to ASP.NET) and the
background asynchronous process which needs a much simpler container.

Keep counting, two services/daemons until now, not accounting for needed
redundancy.

Also the queues, and blobs have to be managed in separate containers, and
also failure/performance monitoring and load balancing.

We are talking here of at least half-a-dozen services/deamons per node. Each
one with specific requirements, most of them not so similar to an
asp.netcontainer (for that part you can take a look at our
xsp/mod_mono code, that
have some startup code and then rely on a library that implements most of
the asp.net host logic).

Also you'll need to determine which protocol all those pieces will use to
interact with each other, as AFAIK those are blackboxed in Azzure. Remoting
is a possibility but it doesn't deal easily with dynamic redirection as
needed for the 'cloud', in that regard even WCF needs to be trubo-charged to
be able to be used in such scenario, and beware, mono still doesn't have a
full implementation of WCF.

But go ahead Keerthi, explore the issues a bit more, look at our code and
come back with more specific questions, we'l be glad to answer.

But I'm quite sure it is too big a project for GSOC, you'll need to find a
smaller part of it to propose and see if someone here can be your tutor.

Enjoy,

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hello Everyone,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I want to know, whether we have already or in future have plans of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> implementing windows azure services( cloud based platform) as part of Mono.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I developed an application with Azure( based on .net 3.5 sp1). It ran
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> without any issues with MOMA. But when I tried it with Mono develop, it says
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the application is not supported. So I assume we have not developed the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> apis.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So I thought, it would help the mono and suse community immensely if I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> try implementing the APIs with regard to the azure services.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The azure runtime environment seems similar to ASP.net( with the xml
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> config files).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It would be very helpful, if you could let me know whether this is a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> viable project to start working on and please let me know where I can start(
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> probably some pointers from people who have implemented asp.net kind of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> func in to Mono)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for helping me out.
