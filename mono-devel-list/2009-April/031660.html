It should work...within reason, as the qualified assembly name will (by
necessity) include the file's base name, e.g. 'mscorlib,
Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089' must
be located within an assembly having 'mscorlib' as the basename.

Now, that (obviously) can't be the only check -- after finding an
assembly with a matching basename it'll need to check that the version,
culture, and PublicKeyToken of the found assembly are correct (and if
not correct continue looking for the next one), but as a start it should
be fine.

Which leads to the next question: where is 'foo.dll' located?  In a path
on the command line, e.g. 'mdoc update path/to/foo.dll'?

Or is foo.dll in the GAC?

Or is foo.dll in MONO_PATH, e.g. 'MONO_PATH=/tmp mdoc update ...'?

For the first two cases (command line and GAC), Cecil *should* be
finding the assembly (otherwise we couldn't resolve IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; and
other mscorlib types, and I know I fixed a bug related to the first case
that the Gendarme build process was encountering).

MONO_PATH, as mentioned before, isn't currently supported (as it hadn't
even occurred to me to support it).  If 'foo.dll' is in MONO_PATH, could
you try using the patch I applied to the previous email and see if that
fixes the issue?

Thanks,
 - Jon
