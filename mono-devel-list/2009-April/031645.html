<PRE>Hello,

    Thanks for your comments on the 1.0 profile:

&gt;<i> I believe however that having a stripped down runtime and (partial) 
</I>&gt;<i> class library without generics support could be useful in embedded 
</I>&gt;<i> scenarios. For example there are routers running Linux with 8 MB RAM and 
</I>&gt;<i> 2 MB flash. (I'm not suggesting that Mono should target them just 
</I>&gt;<i> noticing  the fact that even in the age of gigabytes there are devices 
</I>&gt;<i> with just a few megabytes of RAM and storage.)
</I>
Agreed, but I am not sure that we can serve too many masters at the same
time.  Maintaining the 1.0 profile comes at a high cost in terms of QA,
keeping two code paths, making our code harder to read, making it harder
to debug, forcing us to have more tests and so on.

We are thinking that perhaps 2.4 (or 2.6) could be the last version that
supports 1.0, and we would continue to support that release for 1.0
assemblies but future optimizations would only apply to the 2.0 profile.

I think that even in the embedded scenario folks would likely want to
stay with something like 2.4 instead of having to bring with them the
larger runtime that would come with the increased number of new
features.

</PRE>
