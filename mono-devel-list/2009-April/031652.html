&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On the iPhone using the 1.0 profile is extremely important to cut
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; down on the dll size for mscorlib and friends. Mono already has a big
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; payload when using fullAOT and using 2.0 would make it worse. At the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; same time we would like to get features like SGEN GC and other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; optimizations on the iPhone.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So from our perspective, we would really like to have you keep
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; supporting the 1.0 profile in mono.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am actually wondering about this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The sizes of the mscorlib assemblies are as follows:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.0             2.0M
</I>&gt;<i> 2.0             2.5M
</I>&gt;<i> Silverlight     2.1M
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems that you guys could move to the Silverlight profile and not

</I>&gt;<i> the linker you would not be carrying a lot of extra cruft that you do
</I>&gt;<i> not need.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be useful for me to understand what reasons might prevent you
</I>&gt;<i> from adopting the Silverlight profile.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And in your case, it seems that you guys want to stick to 2.4 and the
</I>&gt;<i> 1.0 profile would continue to be supported there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Not counting that stripping the runtime itself from generics support would
be a pretty hard task
with very little gain both in binary and working-set memory size. OTOH,
there are are some
easy tasks to reduce general memory footprint or to provide for a
low-footprint mono.
