<PRE>Hi all,

Currently, WindowsBase development happens in Olive, and for the
mono-a11y team there is a copy in uia2atk/UIAutomation containing just
the classes needed for UIA support.

This isn't really optimal, as any WPF work is going to require
WindowsBase, and even non-WPF apps are starting to use pieces of it
(such as UIA Verify, an app that the mono-a11y team is brining to
Linux).  There's not currently a good story for getting this assembly
to users, either.

I've heard that if WindowsBase was a little more complete, it would be
okay to move it into mcs/class.  I'd like to help make it more
complete, but I'm not sure what specifically needs to be done.  The
classes I'm interested are mostly complete already, and I'm not as
familiar with the rest of it yet.

Are their specific criteria for inclusion in mcs/class?

Thanks,
Sandy
