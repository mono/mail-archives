<PRE>Hello Ian,

    Thanks for doing the work in porting Mono to the MIPS64 platform and
for sending the patches our way.   Thanks to your developers and to
SiCortex for funding the port.

     Some comments:

&gt;<i> We have put 10 patches to the bugzilla.
</I>&gt;<i> Bug 497320 - [PATCH] Set of Mono MIPS64-bit port patches
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=497320">https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=497320</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Our primary goal was porting to the 64-bit platform. Unfortunatelly, we
</I>&gt;<i> haven't had a chance to test our changes on the box with o32 ABI. There is a
</I>&gt;<i> probability that we broke something. At least as far as we know, the 64-bit
</I>&gt;<i> port is the most usable among MIPS ports to this day. We this port we have
</I>&gt;<i> got quite good results, since regression, extensive and major part of Class
</I>&gt;<i> Library tests (99,60%) are passed successfully.
</I>
While reviewing the patches, I noticed that this extends the MIPS port
to support MIPS64.   And I am wondering if it would make sense to follow
instead a similar setup to what we have done with PowerPC where we
actually have split things in a few places to differentiate PPC from
PPC64.

For example we use a cpu-ppc.md and a cpu-ppc64.md files

Also, we would be happy to give you SVN access so you can merge your
patches directly as they get approved, please follow the instructions
here:

	<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/SVN">http://www.mono-project.com/SVN</A>

As I was reviewing the changes to provide some feedback as to what can
go in, I found that none of the changes come with ChangeLog entries, so
the rationale for some of the changes is not easy to understand.

Would you mind providing ChangeLogs that describe what the changes are
to the various files, in particular the ones that affect the existing 32
bit work from Mark?

Miguel.

</PRE>
