There are statements about serialization issues on the FAQ.

DateTime is somewhat special because all known formatters
provide custom serialization for basic types &amp; DateTime.
ISerializable is not even taken into account for those types.

This means that the issue is pretty minor as it's seldom
seen in real applications.
