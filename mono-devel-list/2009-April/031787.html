</I>&gt;&gt;<i> EXCEPTION: Mono.Debugger.TargetException: Unsupported `mono' executable: 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /usr/bin/mono
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, probably the RPM guys seems to be compiling mono core in some way 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that make imposible for the debugger addin to work...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's a possibility.  Do you know what configure switch would do that?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>acording to a post in the list, guys are having simillar problems when 
mono is compiled with &quot;--disable-static&quot;, do you know if is used when 
the fedora rpm packages are compiled/created?
&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So what are my options?, try to to compile ALL by mysefl to no depend on 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> koji things...but here is where the mscorlib problem came in...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure.  So if you have a problem compiling mono itself and the rpm guys
</I>&gt;<i> are getting mono itself to compile on the platform you're interested in,
</I>&gt;<i> you should take a look at what they're doing.  You can see what sequence
</I>&gt;<i> of commands they're using to compike, what configure options they're
</I>&gt;<i> giving, and what patches they're applying.  Then you can make sure you
</I>&gt;<i> don't apply whatever it is that's causing mono-debugger to malfunction
</I>&gt;<i> while finding out how they are able to build.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>yeap I'm looking at he link that you send me to check that...
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I've just finished building mono-2.4 for Fedora-11 which might have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> additional things that are necessary if you're building from mono's trunk.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> By the way, this is a question about the mscorlib problem compiling 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mono, I'm pretty tired about the fedora support for mono, so please 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't tell me to wait until something that is going to come for fedora 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and things that &quot;might have&quot;, I prefer to try to solve directly the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compilation things and posible make my own paquages for the Univ.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not doing that at all.  I'm telling you -- if you have a problem
</I>&gt;<i> compiling the mono package on Fedora; there's a repeatable recipe for
</I>&gt;<i> getting mono to compile on Fedora in existence.  Comparing it to what
</I>&gt;<i> you're doing will help you find out what you're missing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>sorry if I sound to hard, but honestly I'm pretty tired about the poor 
support of fedora for the mono things, I also offer me and my Univ help 
to some of the koji packages guys, but they don't take it...
&gt;<i> BTW, if you get this to work, the monodevelop packager in Fedora would
</I>&gt;<i> likely be interested in a bug report.  If the problem is a configure
</I>&gt;<i> switch to the mono build, you can email me and I'll get it in.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>surely...
