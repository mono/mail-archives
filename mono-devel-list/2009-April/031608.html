<PRE>Hello Rafael,

Sorry for the late reply. It took me quite a day learning the inner details
and workings of the entire azure framework.

Well, I went through the actual process of developing an app and deploying
in the cloud. Sorry for boring you with all this technical stuff. it works
like this.
In the cloud, they have this storage and processing. And in the documents,
it says you can't have a debugger in the cloud. So development had to be in
the desktop.

And they have this simulated cloud environment for the desktop - which
consists of the STORAGE(queue,blob,tables), SERVICES(starting and stopping
and service related stuff), and couple of command line tools to move the
developed soultion to the cloud.

For the actual cloud they do have all these APIs for storage, and the ones
you said web-facing synch process and background async process and all that.

So to bring real value to the Mono and linux user, it makes sense to first
simulate the cloud environment at the desktop. So if we are able to develop
the application(simulate) at the desktop level using mono, the cloud bases
apis which would be developed at the next stage and it would help the
desktop application to move to the cloud. The moving to the cloud is all
browser based and so intuitive  - ie if we get the desktop app to work, you
can easily port it to the cloud.

So I think the best way for me is to start implementing the desktop based
simulation of the cloud. So how to approach?

i) Services part - The azure actually configures IIS 7.0 to emulate the
cloud based envi at the desktop level. It need to have WCF Http activation
and asp.net 2.0. So I have to work with Apache regarding this I guess and
lot of coding
ii) Storage part - They simulate the cloud based storage (blob,tables) at
the desktop level using SQL server with limited functionality ie no https,
not too much scale.Is it Mysql on our part? and intensive low level coding
iii) And I have to look at the command line tools for porting the dsktop
appln to the cloud( Still haven't figured out the inner details
iv) And finally the UI part, showing the user the simulation like how many
instances of an application are currenly running and if possible having the
project as part of a template( like including the necessary config and xml
files)

These four features are the intial milestones of the big project I think and
which I can specify in the proposal I guess.
Please let me know, whether this is viable and could you be my mentor, if
possible?

Thanks for helping me out,
Keerthi

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But go ahead Keerthi, explore the issues a bit more, look at our code and

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hello Everyone,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I want to know, whether we have already or in future have plans of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> implementing windows azure services( cloud based platform) as part of Mono.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I developed an application with Azure( based on .net 3.5 sp1). It ran
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> without any issues with MOMA. But when I tried it with Mono develop, it says
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the application is not supported. So I assume we have not developed the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> apis.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So I thought, it would help the mono and suse community immensely if I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> try implementing the APIs with regard to the azure services.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The azure runtime environment seems similar to ASP.net( with the xml
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> config files).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It would be very helpful, if you could let me know whether this is a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> viable project to start working on and please let me know where I can start(
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> probably some pointers from people who have implemented asp.net kind of
