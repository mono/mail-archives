Thanks for the post Jonathan, it's comforting to know that others share my
pain... lol..

Yeah, we get some useful information from adding MONO_LOG_LEVEL but I wasn't
able to figure out exactly where it's hanging.  I notice max CPU usage,
which normally indicates that it's stuck in an effective while(true) loop
instead of just 'hung' in some fashion.

As a side note, I recall an issue I had with my application running on Mono
v2.0.1 where it crashes and the app does not close - instead it sits at max
CPU utilization until I kill it.  I don't recall exactly how/why this
happened, but I believe it was an unhanded exception that bubbled up to the
top and for whatever reason AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException was
not firing.  I think I just solved the 'problem' by handling the exception
in my code, but didn't look any deeper into it because I can't use my
application on Mono until I can get Mono v2.4 working anyway (v2.0.1 is
missing stuff I need :-(  ).  I thought I read a reported bug on that which
was fixed in v2.4 but not in v2.2 (where I originally saw this
System.Xml.dll hanging problem)...

I'll try to test the above theory out this week, as that at least may
problem an idea as to what is happening, albeit not why or where.
