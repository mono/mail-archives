<PRE>Isn't the thread instance specific to the app-domain? Are there cases where one thread instance belongs to several different app-domains?
If not, then it's not necessary to move the NumberFormatter out of the thread instance. It was put there to improve performance of the numeric types ToString APIs (since it's such a low-level API a thread specific lookup has a real impact on the performance).

Eyal.

Hi,

The first patch moves the NumberFormatter out of Thread.  As it is now, the NumberFormatter is shared between AppDomains.

The second patch makes sure that an array obtained in another AppDomain is not retained in the calling domain but copied.
