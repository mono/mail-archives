<PRE>Hi,

I don't really use profile 1.0. On MS.NET you can expect not to have 2.0 
installed but since Mono has support for 1.0 and 2.0 at once there is no 
need to stick to 1.0.

Over the time resisting generics is more and more difficult.:)

The only reason I've implemented that piece of code was that I've read 
in the commnet that not having DynamicMethods is a problem and I wanted 
to prove that the same is possible using MethodBuilders without 
modifying a single line of the code generator.

And telling the truth it was very easy to implement. The difficult part 
was to eliminate the chain of methods and the unused DynamicMethod 
arguments because it took time to reallize that none of them is used 
just are left over from some early implementation.

I believe however that having a stripped down runtime and (partial) 
class library without generics support could be useful in embedded 
scenarios. For example there are routers running Linux with 8 MB RAM and 
2 MB flash. (I'm not suggesting that Mono should target them just 
noticing  the fact that even in the age of gigabytes there are devices 
with just a few megabytes of RAM and storage.)
