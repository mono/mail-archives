<PRE>AFAIK GPL permits deriving of GPL work from non-GPL code. Meaning that you
should not be able to use it in almost any means if you are not GPL. Also
MySQL connector is licensed under GPL but there is a FOSS exception
(<A HREF="http://www.mysql.com/about/legal/licensing/foss-exception/">http://www.mysql.com/about/legal/licensing/foss-exception/</A>) to the license
meaning that you can use it for free if you have your code licensed under
some other open source license.

Subject: [Mono-dev] Off topic: Reflection and Licensing question


Hi. Sorry about this, but I think it's slightly on-topic because it has 
to do with Reflection and non-GPLd code.

I've been googling for information about reflection and licenses like 
the GPL, that &quot;prohibit&quot; linking from code with a different license and 
found nothing.

Is reflection considered linking? Or is it considered a form of abstract 
communication such as permitted by the GPL? What would be the legality 
of using a GPLd module through reflection in a closed source or BSD 
application?

I'm not trying to circumvent the GPL. Not that I can, either. I just 
want my app to be able to dinamically load a standard set of libraries, 
and call a generic set of methods. One of this libraries (MySQL 
Connector/NET) happens to be GPLd.

Regards,
Ernesto
