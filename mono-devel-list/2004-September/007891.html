Blackdown is not open source; it's compiled directly from Sun's sources
under the same license.  Please take your Java evangelism to another
list.  Java is neither good nor bad.  It has its own merits.  However,
as someone who is a passive observer on this list following the
development of Mono as a Linux and Unix development tool, I find your
comments unclear and very distracting.  

I have no idea what you are trying to accomplish here, but snapping at
the heals of those people who are working on mono will not do it.  You
have yet to even tell us what your point is, let alone provide any
convincing persuasive arguments for a position.

I believe there have been many intelligent comments and good reasons
given for the continued development of Mono.  I welcome Mono and C# in
particular as a competitor and tool in the arena of FLOSS development
tools.  Java will still continue to be what it is with or without Mono
or the people on this list.  Mono will continue to be what it is with or
without any technology buzzword that comes out of Redmond.
