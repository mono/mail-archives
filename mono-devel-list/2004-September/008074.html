<PRE>Hello Mono developers.
 
The time has finally arrived, our book, Cross-Platform.NET, has just
been published.  We couldn't have done it without all the hardwork and
contributions from the Mono community, who have helped make Mono what it
is today.
 
The book is all about .NET technology using any combination of
Microsoft, Mono or Portable.NET implementations, and features all sorts
of useful information about compatible namespaces, design patterns for
cross-platform architecture, PInvoke, interop, GUI options, automated
testing and building - in short, all sorts of useful stuff for hobby and
professional coder alike.  It has a forward by Miguel De Icaza and is
edited by Jon Pryor.
 
We would love you to take a few minutes to look at our site (where there
is a more detailed chapter breakdown), and hopefully you will feel
inclined to read the book too.  Should you wish to contribute to the
website's content in any way, please please do get in touch.  We are
particularly keen to post news about / from anyone involved in the
efforts to build integrated development environments.   We have space
for articles, news and we are aiming to put together a book review
section - so if you have an opinion that you would like to share about a
favourite book, let us know.  If you can contribute anything at all
towards any of these subjects, it would be great to have your material
hosted on our site.
