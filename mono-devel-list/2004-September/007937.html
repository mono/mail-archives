<PRE>RE: RE: [Mono-devel-list] ByteFX developmentHi All,

Please, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that the licence of the MySql
database only allows you to develop apps that are open source. If you are
intending on selling/distributing a commercial product that uses MySql as
the backend, then you are required you to purchase a comercial licence for
MySql.

Because of this, the LGPL version of ByteFX is only of any use to open
source projects. If you want to sell a comercial product, you need to
purchase the licence, which I guess will also include their commercial
version of the GPL library that MySql provides.

I think this might eliminate the need to develop the LGPL version if the
main intent is that it can be use in commercial applications.

Hope I 'm wrong in my understandind of the MySql Licence but I think it's
worth checking before doing the work...

Thanks for your great work mono developers :)

Regards,
Luis

  Yes, I agree, that is more of an issue if you are intending to sell a
product based on GPL code.

  However, I would think that you could pay them a fee and obtain the same
code under a different license
  if the time came to actually making money out of it.

  &gt; If you have a look at the www.ByteFX.com and go to the data provider
  &gt; tab, you'll see there that Reggie is now part of MySQL and the ByteFX
  &gt; code is what he is developing for them.
  &gt;
  &gt; I don't see any reason why, given the work he's doing, you wouldn't
  &gt; want to stick with his code, since I understand he is making sure that
  &gt; it's mono compatible.
  &gt;
  &gt; Reggie has always been responsive to any issues that have arisen, and
  &gt; I would hope that he is just as responsive these days, even though
  &gt; he's probably got some other stuff to work on as well.
  &gt;
  &gt; Regards,
  &gt; Peter.

  The licensing of MySQL makes it less than appealing for commercial use.
As I mentioned in my first email, the license has changed from lgpl to gpl
meaning that any applications that use the MySQL connector become gpl'ed.
Here is the link to the connector downloads page:

  <A HREF="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/1.0.html">http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/1.0.html</A>

  Here is the GNU description of whether you can link or not:

  <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#LinkingWithGPL">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#LinkingWithGPL</A>

  Given this it seems very useful to maintain development of a lgpl MySQL
client.

  Chris
