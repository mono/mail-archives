Linking against their libraries is one thing.  Speaking their network
protocol and still being forced to GPL is another.  That's just plain
bull.  That may be what MySQL would want, but it's just not legal. 
That's not what the GPL says, and it certainly is against the spirit of
the GPL as expressed by the FSF.  Sounds like it is time for a new
clause in the GPL to clarify this.

Given this questionable interpretation of the GPL on their part, I will
never use MySQL where I can help it.  PostgreSQL seems to do the job
just fine and is not encumbered by bizarre attempts at restriction.

This is very microsoft-esque and I don't like it.  Surely a network
protcol can be reverse engineered for &quot;interoperability.&quot;
