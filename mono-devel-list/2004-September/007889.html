Yes. Yes you are.

I dont have any particular disdain for Microsoft. However, It is very
possible that John has disdain for Microsoft potentially on the business
ethic level. Business ethics and Technical abilities are not related.

And I don't think it is exactly 'working side by side'.

So then what are you doing?

Java is 'SourceOpen' the same way that Microsoft's Rotor SSCLI
implementation of .net is 'opensource'. If anything, Rotor is even more
'SourceOpen'. The ability to download the source code of an application
does not make it opensource or even 'SourceOpen' (Whatever that is).

&gt;<i> Better for me i have checked and certified JVM (exceptionally the

</I>&gt;<i> SUN checks Blackdown also but for zero costs as tribute to OpenSource.
</I>
Good. Go develop Java software and stop spamming this mailing list with
your stuff. If you aren't interested in developing with mono or for
mono, we aren't interested in you polluting this mailing list. It's
fine, we will do perfectly ok without your contributions. So don't lose
any sleep over it.
