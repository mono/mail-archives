<PRE>If you have a look at the www.ByteFX.com and go to the data provider tab,
you'll see there that Reggie is now part of MySQL and the ByteFX code is
what he is developing for them.

I don't see any reason why, given the work he's doing, you wouldn't want to
stick with his code, since I understand he is making sure that it's mono
compatible.

Reggie has always been responsive to any issues that have arisen, and I
would hope that he is just as responsive these days, even though he's
probably got some other stuff to work on as well.

Regards,
Peter.

Subject: Re: [Mono-devel-list] ByteFX development

Hello,

&gt;<i> I'd like to see the ByteFX code continue development, it seems quite 
</I>&gt;<i> useful to have a well supported lgpl way of interfacing to a MySQL 
</I>&gt;<i> database.  I'm still trying to get in touch with the developers listed 
</I>&gt;<i> on the sf page but it has been proposed on #mono to integrate the 
</I>&gt;<i> ByteFX code back into mono, perhaps in place of Mono.Data.MySql.
</I>
We already ship ByteFX.Data as part of Mono, the Mono.Data.MySql assembly
has been depreciated in favor of that.

&gt;<i> I'd be willing to help out with code clean up and improving the 
</I>&gt;<i> documentation but don't have enough free time to be the sole 
</I>&gt;<i> maintainer of ByteFX or whatever it becomes.  It would be nice to have 
</I>&gt;<i> at least a couple of active developers working on things.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thoughts?
</I>
You could jump start the effort, and we will be glad to help you a little
bit, while we grow a community ;-)

Miguel
