Both of these are wrong, and neither of them are &quot;good style&quot;.

The reason they are wrong is that the original loop takes the remainder of
a division by 256; your modulus operations use a divisor of 255, which will
yield wildly incorrect results.

The appropriate way to implement this is simply:

h %= 256;

The division involved only takes a handful of clock cycles on modern
processors, and certainly a conditional operation will involve a branch of
some sort, and you want to avoid that.

If you don't mind sacrificing a small amount of readability, you can same
those division cycles by using a bitwise AND operation. This only works for
powers of two, but the above could be written as:

h &amp;= 255;

Note that this value is one less than the power of two, while the divisor
for the '%' operatior is the power of two itself.

It should also be noted that when negative values are involved, neither of
these &quot;replacements&quot; duplicates the behaviour of the original loop. I
haven't looked at the full code, so I don't know if this is an issue, but,
for example:

-257 % 256 == -1
-257 &amp; 255 == +255

When passed through the original loop, however, -257 is unchanged (since it
is never larger than 255, the condition to enter the loop in the first place).
