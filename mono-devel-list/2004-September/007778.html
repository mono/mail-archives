</I>&gt;<i> 	I was under the impression that they were constant across platforms

</I>POSIX/SUS define only the event symbolic names and their meanings, the
values assigned to the names are not defined there. I think in reality they
might be the same across platforms, but you must not rely on it IMO. I think
the tough problem is that the constants cannot even be reliably queried on
the runtime, so basically there will always be a threat you're using invalid
values (unless you, perhaps, provide a C code snippet compiled for the
target platform, of course).
