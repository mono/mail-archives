<PRE>It seems like ByteFX is no longer being maintained.  There haven't been any 
changes to the sourceforge project, <A HREF="http://www.sf.net/projects/mysqlnet,">http://www.sf.net/projects/mysqlnet,</A> in 
three months.  MySQL has taken over support of development and the license 
has changed to gpl.

I'd like to see the ByteFX code continue development, it seems quite useful to 
have a well supported lgpl way of interfacing to a MySQL database.  I'm still 
trying to get in touch with the developers listed on the sf page but it has 
been proposed on #mono to integrate the ByteFX code back into mono, perhaps 
in place of Mono.Data.MySql.  

I'd be willing to help out with code clean up and improving the documentation 
but don't have enough free time to be the sole maintainer of ByteFX or 
whatever it becomes.  It would be nice to have at least a couple of active 
developers working on things.

Thoughts?

Chris
