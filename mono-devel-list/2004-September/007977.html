<PRE>&gt;<i> We already ship ByteFX.Data as part of Mono, the Mono.Data.MySql
</I>&gt;<i> assembly has been depreciated in favor of that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm aware of this.  Does it really make sense to keep the ByteFX stuff a separate project if the original developers have moved on?  It seems easier to credit ByteFX and its authors with the creating of Mono's Data.MySql component and make it an official part of mono.

 
&gt;<i> &gt; I'd be willing to help out with code clean up and improving the documentation 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but don't have enough free time to be the sole maintainer of ByteFX or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whatever it becomes.  It would be nice to have at least a couple of active 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; developers working on things.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You could jump start the effort, and we will be glad to help you a
</I>&gt;<i> little bit, while we grow a community ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
We would need somewhere to store the code repository.  Moving ByteFX into mono in place of Mono.Data.MySql should solve that problem as well as make it simpler for the end user to figure out which one to use.  I'll offer to be the maintainer at this stage.  I'm still hoping others will come to help out ;-)

I still haven't received any replies from the authors, if anyone has contact with them I'd like to see what they think about the whole thing.

Chris
