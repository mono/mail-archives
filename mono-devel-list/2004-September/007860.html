<PRE>I want to point out that you are wrong in that the new windowing system is
built on XML.

In fact, XAML (the XML UI declaration schema) is just a way to declare your
UI structure.  What the compiler does is converts this to C# code on the
back end. In fact, when you write XAML you are just declaring class names
and setting properties on them (which is why you can hook up to events
written in C#).

This all takes advantage of the new partial class feature in C# 2.0.  It
allows you to spread a single class over multiple files. So part of the
classes implementation can be in a XAML file, and the other can be in C#.
This only works because XAML is converted to C# in the background.

In fact, XAML isn't limited to just Display stuff.  In fact you can
instantiate any class in the .NET Framework using XAML.  It is just a
declarative type programming method.

Of course, it is mostly useful with UI's and that is why you see it used
here most often.

If you have any questions, let me know.

Take care!

Sincerely,
Nathan

Subject: [Mono-devel-list] How can Mono Existing if WinFX, Avalon, Indigio
and Aero comes up with Longhorn and WinXP?

Hi Monofolks,

In the Last Days i hve reading some Microsoft stuff about, chaning 
WinForms to the new
managed Code API called WinFX. WinFX includes an .NET Managed Windowing 
Toolkit and
WinForms will be deprecated in Future (there are Statements on the 
WinHEC thadt Microsoft takes
care for a Interoperatibility, but i dont know...).

The New GUI Windowing System is based on XML (a Subinterpreation called 
XAML) and should
allow more seamless Things between Documents and Application Windows or 
something like thadt.

WinFX is integrated into Longhorn and it can be installed to WinFX and 
is Microsoft longterm
Plan for .NET and Windows together (i think it is clear why they are 
doing thadt, to bring trouble
to Mono)

Anyway, the .NET Runtim and many Things from Longhorn would be 
rewritten  from C/C++ to C#
and Managed Code. The .NET Runtime will be a integrated  Component 
inside the Operatingsystem
and any other Programms should based ont it.

I dont know what is up with the Win32-API but it looks like, thadt Microsoft
will the Support cuttof after a Time.

The Webbrowser Internet Explorer will also as Webcomponets fully 
integrated with
Windows Longhorn.


ps:
I think MS will go on and make the Next Visual Studuio Version a Mix of 
WinFX and other
Longhorn Technologies.If this comes true, then it cannot be run on Mono. 
The Only way is, to
cover the complete WinFX API with all Sub API thadt are Close Source.

Falk
