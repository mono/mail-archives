Okay, so I had it working this afternoon, but I came home and now it 
isn't working again. The error log shows nothing when I try and execute 
the HelloWorld web service. I am still getting ConnectFailure.

On a whim, I just tried changing the URL to be the hostname instead of 
the domain. That worked. My domain name is a dyndns account, and there 
is some host file hacking keeping my duct tape and baling wire system 
going. Something somewhere is out of sync. At any rate, thanks for the 
help, the problem is squarely mine, but perhaps the ConnectFailure 
message could be bolstered with some information about what is trying to 
be connected.
