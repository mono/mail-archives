<PRE>Hi,

I have been lurking in the background and was wondering what the
situation is when I have provider factory like:

<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/provider-factory.html">http://www.go-mono.com/provider-factory.html</A>
or
<A HREF="http://www.codeproject.com/cs/database/DALComponents.asp">http://www.codeproject.com/cs/database/DALComponents.asp</A>

which, let's say, uses System.Data as a default provider but could also
use a GPL'ed DataProvider if the user were so inclined and modified the
app.config accordingly. 

Am I then as a developer of this application in the position that I need
to conform to all licenses which might apply to the possible data
providers, just because I am using a DB provider factory that could in
theory support them? This seems ridiculous to me, as I am just providing
someone with the opportunity to use another DB provider if they want, I
am not distributing it with my application. If this is the case,
however, then suddenly flexible nature of the IDb* interfaces falls into
a whole other light for me...

I am interested in hearing what all the 'non-lawyers' out there there
think...

Regards,
--chris

</I>&gt;<i> something to do with making copies of someone else's copyrighted work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I'm getting at is this: There has to be a reason, based in law, for 
</I>&gt;<i> why the GPL license would be binding on me as a developer.  Normally, 
</I>&gt;<i> people can't tell me how I have to license my work.  Why can the GPL 
</I>&gt;<i> force me to do something?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's *not* because I agreed to the GPL when I downloaded GPL software, 
</I>&gt;<i> or when I used a GPL program.  The GPL isn't an EULA or click-through 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;license&quot; -- the GPL is not a contract.  (I read a good explanation 
</I>&gt;<i> about this somewhere, but it was long ago so I don't have a reference 
</I>&gt;<i> off hand.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are circumstances, however, when I'm legally not allowed to make 
</I>&gt;<i> copies of my own work (oversimplification alert).  If my code is a 
</I>&gt;<i> derivative of or contains someone else's code, copyright law says I 
</I>&gt;<i> cannot distribute my code without the permission of the owner of the 
</I>&gt;<i> other code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now the GPL comes into the picture.  When code is released under the 
</I>&gt;<i> GPL, it's a blanket statement giving anyone permission to distribute 
</I>&gt;<i> derivatives or combinations of the GPLed code.  Except, it only gives 
</I>&gt;<i> permission to you if you agree to a few things, one of which is that you 
</I>&gt;<i> have to GPL your code too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So the moral of the story is that you're only bound by the GPL if you 
</I>&gt;<i> are attempting to make copies of something that 1) you don't hold the 
</I>&gt;<i> copyright on, 2) you don't have specific permission from the copyright 
</I>&gt;<i> holder to make copies of, and 3) the code has been released under the GPL.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Relying on&quot; and &quot;making copies of&quot; are two different things, and only 
</I>&gt;<i> the latter is illegal without a license.  When copyright law is not 
</I>&gt;<i> involved, neither is the GPL.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The next question is: Can you rely on software without making a 
</I>&gt;<i> derivative/copy of some aspect of it?  So, you might be right that if 
</I>&gt;<i> you rely on GPL software you are bound by the GPL, but only if relying 
</I>&gt;<i> on the software necessarily involves integrating GPLed stuff, or a 
</I>&gt;<i> derivative of it, into your own stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So who decides whether referencing a GPLed assembly ends up with a 
</I>&gt;<i> derivative work?  Not the GPL, and not the owner of the GPL code.  Only 
</I>&gt;<i> courts can decide, because only courts can decide whether something is 
</I>&gt;<i> copyright infringement.  Since a court hasn't taken up this topic yet 
</I>&gt;<i> (unless there's somehow applicable precedent), it's entirely undefined.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I liked that disclaimer, Jon.  I'm going to reference it here in an 
</I>&gt;<i> attempt at irony.
