You know.

After 20 years in IT you know what the biggest mistake of all is?

It's getting all twisted over a bunch of Micrsoft Vaporware with lots of 
pretty names.

Microsoft uses this technique to disparge and thwart people who are way 
ahead of it in terms of programming and technology.

They hear these words like 'Avalon' and they assume 'oh these Microsoft 
guys are so smart -- why bother'

But, in the end, M$ never releases half of what it says...and at the 
point that the other guy drops his spear in the sand, M$ definitely 
doesn't expend the energy to develop it.

So, in the end the develop gets thwarted, the users never get the 
functionality, and Microsoft can charge people money without having done 
any work.

Let's just keep going with mono, gtksharp and so on.

99.9999 percent of what 'LongWait' is can, and is being built at the 
application level.

And, with OSS and Linux, it can more easily push its way into the OS -- 
where appropriate.

Don't be fooled by Microsoft Tricksters and Trolls !

</I>&gt;<i> The really elaborate parts are the rendering engine, and the
