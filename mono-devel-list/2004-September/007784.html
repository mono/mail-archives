</I>Indeed, which is why we're investigating and trying to resolve this.

&gt;<i> Is Mono the only platform that has this timing issue? 
</I>Yes it seems to be just Mono that has this issue.

&gt;<i> Have you considered an alterative mechanism for timing the execution,
</I>&gt;<i> or even using the real time instead?
</I>We've mostly been continuing what Doug Bagley started, so there's a
reluctance to mess with that. 
There are issues with the timing resolution we get with user-time &amp;
sys-time, but there are also issues with using wall-clock time - you'll
notice that many of the compiled languages have very similar times, and
some might suggest that wall-clock time would just introduce more
variation unrelated to program runtime.
