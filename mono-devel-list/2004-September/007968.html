The GPL doesn't differentiate between static or dynamic linking.  It
only cares about linking -- does the GPL'd code exist within your
process?  If so, then your code *must* be GPL.  Period.

See: <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLAndPlugins">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLAndPlugins</A>

Just to make things &quot;interesting&quot;, using some form of IPC (CORBA,
sockets, etc.) between separate processes doesn't necessarily avoid a
GPL violation: <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#MereAggregation">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#MereAggregation</A>

        if the semantics of the communication are intimate enough,
        exchanging complex internal data structures, that too could be a
        basis to consider the two parts as combined into a larger
        program.

Which begs the question: could communicating with a GPL program over a
publicly documented protocol be interpreted as &quot;combining two modules
into one program&quot;?  I imagine that it depends on the protocol -- if it's
a standardized protocol such as ODBC, probably not.  If only one program
uses it --  the GPL program -- then maybe.

You'd certainly have to ask a lawyer about it.

I also have no idea what protocols MySQL supports for IPC.

I can say this: if the MySQL protocol is *only* used by MySQL, and the
protocol requires &quot;intimate&quot; semantics, a non-GPL client library may not
be possible.  (Of course, a definition of &quot;intimate semantics&quot; would
require the involvement of a lawyer.  And possibly a court of law.)

However, I imagine that MySQL supports ODBC, so if you used ODBC to
communicate with MySQL the ODBC client library could be LGPL or MIT/X11.
