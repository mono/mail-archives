<PRE>Hi,

I am using embedded mono as a scripting language runtime in our game engine
and I would like to use coroutines to simplify some of our game code.

I want to be able to write scripts like this:

void Update ()
{
    Console.WriteLine (&quot;Starting up&quot;);
    //Yields for 20 seconds, then continues
    WaitFor (20.F);
    Console.WriteLine (&quot;20 seconds later&quot;);
}

The WaitFor function would yield back to unmanaged code.
The unmanaged code would then simply go on, possibly calling other C#
methods in the same class/instance.
After 20 seconds, the engine would resume the Update method.


- I am looking for the simplest to implement solution. It does not have to
be very fast, at least for now.

- If it is possible i would like to modify as little mcs code as possible
since we are going to support javascript and python later on and i would
like to be able to just put in support for other languages without having to
make the compiler support special yield functionality.

Where do i start?
Any idea's on how to implement this?
Is anyone else working on it?
