<PRE>WinFX was not dropped, the SQL based file system that was part of WinFX, 
WinFS, was. Aero (display) and Indigo (communication) are still planned.

I think it has been said that Aero would be easier to implement in Mono than 
the current Winforms, mostly because Winforms are a Win32 wrapper, and Aero 
isn't. (It's surprising how much people use interop with Winforms if 
microsoft.public.dotnet.framework.windowsforms is to be believed.)

Like other said, that's why Microsoft going managed is being welcomed I 
think. The less native API they have, the more easily can applications be 
made cross platform.
