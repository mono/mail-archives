	I was under the impression that they were constant across platforms
from the docs I read, however docs can be misleading. I need this
function for System.Windows.Forms and only the X driver will use it, so
windows is not an issue however OSX is. Maybe it would be better to use
select, I am not sure how to implement FD_SET though....

Thanks,
Jackson
