Since DragonFly is based on FreeBSD 4 you are going to need to look at a
fair amount of threading and garbage collection issues.  Currenly Mono
does not work on FreeBSD 4 due to these problems.  More than likely it
never will since FreeBSD 5 is about to be tagged as the next stable
branch, replacing FreeBSD 4.  There has been a fair amount of work both
port side and base side to get Mono working...  Even then it's still
limping but being addressed.

&gt;<i>From my limited knowledge of DragonFly, I believe one of the design
</I>issues that forced the fork was over threading.  The patches currently
available in FreeBSD's port as well as NetBSD's port (check the Attic)
may or may not help.  There's an OpenBSD port for 0.97 floating around
the internet that you can google for as well that may be of help.
