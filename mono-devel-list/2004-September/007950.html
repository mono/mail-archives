<PRE>Hi Francisco
I appreciate your nice effort to develop Visual Studio Addin for Mono .
I was eager to try this but problem is that,
2nd link 
&lt;<A HREF="http://ftp.novell.com/pub/forge/prj2make-sharp/Windows/v0.95/vsprj2makeSetup.msi">http://ftp.novell.com/pub/forge/prj2make-sharp/Windows/v0.95/vsprj2makeSetup.msi</A> 
 &gt; is not working for me.
i could not download this nice addin.
Could i download it from other web site?
Is this addin able to debug the test applications with mono runtime in VS 
.Net environment?
Loooking forward for your reply
Thanx

Francisco, I will echo a couple of other comments I've seen concerning your 
add-in for testing Mono stuff in vs.net. Your work IS appreciated. Please 
keep the faith and keep on developing the add-in. I plan on downloading and 
giving it a try as soon as my work schedule loosens up just a bit. regards,

already do this. &gt; &gt;:-) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I have a vs.net solution that has various 
assemblies built, mostly for &gt; &gt;testing and debugging System.Data and its 
data providers. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Two big reasons why I use vs.net to do Mono stuff: 
debugger and editor. &gt; &gt;...since there is no Mono debugger on Windows. &gt; &gt; &gt; 
 &gt;Wouldn't it be cool if someone created a Glade addin? This way we could &gt; 
 &gt;visually design gtk# apps in vs.net. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a little update to 
the development status of my Add-in, I have &gt; completed the first Alpha 
release of it. It is contained in an MSI &gt; file. I will likely change it to 
a NSIS installer package later on. If &gt; you or anyone decides to install it, 
you can expect this.: &gt; - A new pop-up menu called prj2make placed at the 
top of the &gt; Visual Studio .NET 2003 Tools menu. &gt; - Create Makefile should 
generate acceptable nmake.exe &gt; Makefile.Win32 files targeting csc.exe and 
the .NET runtiime. &gt; - All other menu options are to be treated as &quot;Under &gt; 
Construction&quot; (I have kept them there as a preview of where I am going &gt; 
with this). &gt; &gt; You can find the MSI on the 'files' section of the Novell 
Forge project &gt; page for prj2make-sharp: &gt; 
<A HREF="http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1395">http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1395</A> &gt; 
should be near the bottom of the page. Or you can fetch it out of the &gt; 
Forge ftp site using: &gt; 
<A HREF="http://ftp.novell.com/pub/forge/prj2make-sharp/Windows/v0.95/vsprj2makeSetup.msi">http://ftp.novell.com/pub/forge/prj2make-sharp/Windows/v0.95/vsprj2makeSetup.msi</A> 
 &gt; &gt; &gt;Somone may have already created a Nunit GUI addin for vs.net, so 
getting &gt; &gt;that to work for testing Mono would rock! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The 
initial work on this Add-in (going on 43 hours) has lead me to &gt; believe 
that the biggest contribution that this effort can give the &gt; community 
right now is the core mechanics on how to write a VS Add-in in &gt; the first 
place. If nothing else you can always look at the code in CVS. &gt; &gt; &gt;I know 
SharpDevelop has an Nunit GUI integrated. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Add-in could have 
been a lot further along in terms of capabilities &gt; and functionality, but 
no one has collaborated with me in the issues &gt; that I posed on a posting I 
submitted on Jun 19 to the [Mono-devel-list] &gt; with Subject: Visual Studio 
Addin. &gt; &gt; I realize that everybody is very occupied right now with Mono 1.0 
 &gt; release issues, but I can't help to feel a bit sadden by the fact that &gt; 
aside from you and Urs, I have not received any comments (good or bad) &gt; on 
this effort. &gt; &gt; Best regards. &gt; &gt; Paco &gt;
