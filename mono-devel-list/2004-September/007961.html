<PRE>&gt;<i> I am not sure why you cut the mailing list out of the reply (or maybe i
</I>&gt;<i> did), however, I will keep it this way.
</I>
I didn't do it on purpose, I'll put it back since it might be of interest to others.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that in the mono devels view, Mono.Data.Mysql is deprecated and
</I>&gt;<i> ByteFX.MySql is unsupported. Reggie had always maintained it seperately,
</I>&gt;<i> and it was shipped with mono for convenience (My understanding of the
</I>&gt;<i> situation).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see why that would change just because someone else is talking
</I>&gt;<i> about maintaining abandoned code. I think that would change if the code
</I>&gt;<i> was no longer abandoned. However, right you are still have abandoned
</I>&gt;<i> code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why is the renaming important? If it is just to remove the ByteFX name,
</I>&gt;<i> replace it with something else... I guess I just don't understand how
</I>&gt;<i> the name change really effects that much.
</I>
The naming isn't the most critical issue although someone pointed out that ByteFX may be trademarked.

I see the issue as one simplicity and organization.  For mono to present two MySQL interfaces, one that is from a 3rd party that is no longer supported, and another integrated interface that is deprecated in favor of the 3rd party seems confusing and disorganized on mono's part.

I'd rather have a single unsupported interface with a name that indicates that it is an integrated mono component. People would know to talk to mono developers and they can assume correctly that the code is in the mono repository.
