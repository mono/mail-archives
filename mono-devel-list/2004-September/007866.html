Yeah. you want port the whole closed SourceWinFX API for .NET,ok 
Congratulations,
thadt willbe a Fine work!

Remember WinFX is not alone, it comes with Avalon (GUI-Layer with Aero) 
, Idigio (Networking
and EnhancedWebservices) and Moand  (Commandlineshell and Scripting Env)

How do you think how long you can rewrite a Mono Version of WinFX and 
its closed
Source Parts if Microsoft every Month putting new Things on the Market?

Microsoft is an Giant and not intresting to Support Linux or Novell and 
it is clear thadt
they want make some nasty Tricks to make it happend.

No, i think the only Way is to goto Java and write Windows Appz and if 
the Rumors about
SUN will buy Novell is true, then Mono is gone anyway.

I dont belive thadt MS would support Linux and Mono, and it is more sure 
you are running
into Trouble, if the only Thing you are doing is to adopt Windows Things 
to Mono.

Maybe it is an better Choice, to Make a Own, not Micorosft specially 
targeted VM
Technologie. All  things should be written in Bytecode (or however you 
it called) and only
the JVM Layer should be native (or based on Devicedriver and/or Kernel 
Modules)

The Advantage is, you can write Easy an Device Driver thadt Hosts the VM 
and on its
inside runs the Application untouched - like Java Appz does.

A Free Java Projekt for Example.
