<PRE>I am just reposting this because I forgot the cardinal rule... &quot;Change
the Subject to something meaningful...&quot;
 
So I am just resending with the proper subject.
 
&lt;PreviousPost type=&quot;Silly XML Style&quot;&gt;
 
Just a quick comment on this from me (I try to follow Don Box's
exploits
in this world closely). I agree 100%. Remoting should be limited to
interappdomain/process communication. The recommenced path (according
to
Microsoft) is to use ASMX primarily, or if higher performance is
needed
use DCOM I believe. Remoting was reserved for communication between
processes where types can be &quot;guaranteed&quot; to be the same.
 
Also with Indigo they are going toward the &quot;WSE&quot; style of
interoperability. So instead of using a &quot;remoting&quot; style of interop,
they are using the ASMX style of connected systems where the contracts
are shared but not the types. I would recommend in Mono an investment
be
made WSE classes as they would be a precursor to Indigo classes
in Mono. I know it will take some effort creating the channels and
ports
and so on, but I think it would be a step in the right direction.

According to some of the quotes I've read, remoting is in a similar
state as COM.. It is not dead, but it is pretty much done. Most
development will be in the WSE style of coding and connecting.

Anyway, that's my 2 cents on the issue.

Thanks

Richard Norman
