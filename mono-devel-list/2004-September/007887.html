<PRE>Iam amusing.

If you dont like Microsoft (like i do) why do you working side by side 
on a Port
of its strategic Core Product?

You are a littlte bit masochistic??

Iam not a Microsoft Lawyer and iam only develop Software in C/C++ and 
Java on all
Platforms my customers asking me for to write Software.

After 10 Years Software Development in C/C++ and x86 Assembler  and SQL 
there to many
poor things on DOS and Windows Platforms  and Java helps me to forget 
all this nastig
Things.

In Java i have a Virtual Machine and inside this my Programm works fin 
on every OS where
a Virtual Machine is present. What should i say, it works fine for me 
and i have no Trouble with it.

Ad it is Source Open but not OpenSource and i feel really better if Java 
dont wanna OpenSource,
then any People can criple Java and the compatibility is blown away.

Better for me i have checked and certified JVM (exceptionally the 
Blackdown OpenSource Project)
SUN checks Blackdown also but for zero costs as tribute to OpenSource.

&gt;<i> You know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After 20 years in IT you know what the biggest mistake of all is?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's getting all twisted over a bunch of Micrsoft Vaporware with lots 
</I>&gt;<i> of pretty names.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft uses this technique to disparge and thwart people who are 
</I>&gt;<i> way ahead of it in terms of programming and technology.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They hear these words like 'Avalon' and they assume 'oh these 
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft guys are so smart -- why bother'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But, in the end, M$ never releases half of what it says...and at the 
</I>&gt;<i> point that the other guy drops his spear in the sand, M$ definitely 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't expend the energy to develop it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, in the end the develop gets thwarted, the users never get the 
</I>&gt;<i> functionality, and Microsoft can charge people money without having 
</I>&gt;<i> done any work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's just keep going with mono, gtksharp and so on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 99.9999 percent of what 'LongWait' is can, and is being built at the 
</I>&gt;<i> application level.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And, with OSS and Linux, it can more easily push its way into the OS 
</I>&gt;<i> -- where appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Don't be fooled by Microsoft Tricksters and Trolls !
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;snip&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      Avalon plans
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On the surface Avalaon seems like it uses something like 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> GdiPlus/Cairo for rendering. That was my initial feeling, but it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> turns out that they had to rewrite everything to have a performing 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rendering engine, and implement some very advanced rendering features 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that include compositing with video streams, also their brushes seem 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to be fairly powerful.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> XAML, a new markup language that binds tags to .NET classes was also 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> presented, but this is the least interesting part. A tiny compiler 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> translates the XAML source files into C# code. The whole process is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just like Glade, and should be easy to do.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The really elaborate parts are the rendering engine, and the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> composition model for widgets. It is a complete new toolkit, and if 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we want to implement this one, we will have to have a new toolkit on 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Unix, incompatible with everything else, maybe stressing the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> importance of working with other open source projects in defining a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cross-toolkit theming strategy to address this particular problem.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A Mini-Avalon is easy to do, but a complete one will require much 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interaction with other groups: the Cairo folks are probably the most 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> qualified to assist us.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;/snip&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I think it has been said that Aero would be easier to implement in 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Mono than 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> look at above, then you see the reality
