<PRE>Hello all,

I happen to have a complimentary copy/license of Microsoft Visual
Studio Team Suite 2008 with MSDN Premium.  I figured that I would
follow the lead of a colleague of mine, and give away one of these
licenses to a contributor of an OSS project, in this case, Mono, with
the aim of hopefully encouraging more community involvement in Mono.

I was thinking that perhaps the current committers have the best sense
of the Mono contributors and their efforts, so I like to propose maybe
running a contest, start and end to be determined.  At the end of the
contest, the commiters would vote on the contributions during that
time period, and then I would send the VSTS2008 license to the
contributor with the most votes (I'll cover the cost of shipping).

About the only restriction that I would place is that I'd like the
recipient of the license to be &quot;independent&quot;, that is to say, not
employed by Novell.

How does this sound to everyone?  I'm open to suggestions, ideas,
comments, so if you have any, please speak up.
