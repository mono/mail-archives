Subject: Re: [Mono-dev] &quot;CultureInfo.IsReadOnly&quot; returns &quot;TRUE&quot; for
&quot;Referenced Assemblies&quot; on Solaris SPARC

 

Hi Avinash,

I'm not exactly sure about what your issue is. Seens like you found a
bug on the culture of referenced assemblies. If that the case, mind
filling a bug report with a test case that shows it?

2008/6/18 &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">avinash.ramesh at wipro.com</A>&gt;:

Hi,

 

Platform: Mono Built ON Solaris 7 SPARC 32. 

 

Test case Failure:  Culture Info read-only property set to &quot;TRUE&quot; for
the &quot;Referenced Assemblies&quot;. When the expected result was &quot;FALSE&quot;

 

Analysis:

 

While analyzing the failure of the
mono-1.9/mcs/class/corlib/System.Reflection/AssebmlyNameTest.cs..

 

1) Test Case failure at AssemblyNameTest.cs

2)  Failure happens while checking whether the culture info of the
referenced assembly has the read-only property set as &quot;False&quot;.

3) While trying to analyze we found out that, the culture info of all
referenced assemblies in our case, the referenced assemblies being

    &quot;MSCORLIB&quot;, &quot;NUNIT.FRAMEWORK&quot;, returns the culture info read only
property as True, because of which the test case fails to execute.

 

When executing the same test case on the &quot;Runtime 2.0&quot; all the test
cases executes successfully without any failure.

 

Inference:

 

And while going through various links and stuffs we found a patch very
close to the above mentioned issue which is already applied to the
source. Am including the link here for your reference

 

<A HREF="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=347174#c17">https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=347174#c17</A>
&lt;<A HREF="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=347174%23c17">https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=347174%23c17</A>&gt; 

 

We also figured out by searching on this issue and going through the
mono source that, the read only property by default is set to &quot;FALSE&quot;,
which in our case is not happening for the referenced assemblies build
and getting executed on Solaris 7 SPARC platform.

 

Assistance Required:

 

It would be of great help if you people could shed your views and
highlight the things lacking from our side to execute the test case
successfully.

 

Thanks  

 

Best regards
