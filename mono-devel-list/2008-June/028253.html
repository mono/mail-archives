<PRE>
It feels like I&#8217;ve been dusting my head against a brick wall for the last 2
days. I cannot get mono to compile on OSX. I have copied the latest code for
both mono and mcs from SVN.
When I try to run ./autogen.sh &#8211;prefix=/usr/local
I get:
Running libtoolize...
Running aclocal  ...
Running autoheader...
Running automake --gnu  ...
automake: mono/profiler/Makefile.am: `libmono-profiler-cov.la' is already
going to be installed in `lib'
automake: mono/profiler/Makefile.am: `libmono-profiler-aot.la' is already
going to be installed in `lib'
**Error**: automake failed.
If I download the latest tarball I can run ./configure &#8211;prefix=/usr/local  I
get a lot of yeses and no&#8217;s. What would be considered a successful run? When
I run make it runs for some time and I can see warnings in the output but no
errors. How would I know if the build was successful?
When I run make install
I get
Making install in libgc
Making install in include
Making install in private
make[4]: Nothing to be done for `install-exec-am'.
make[4]: Nothing to be done for `install-data-am'.
make[4]: Nothing to be done for `install-exec-am'.
make[4]: Nothing to be done for `install-data-am'.
Making install in doc
make[3]: Nothing to be done for `install-exec-am'.
test -z &quot;/usr/local/share/libgc-mono&quot; || .././install-sh -c -d
&quot;/usr/local/share/libgc-mono&quot;
mkdir: /usr/local/share: Permission denied
mkdir: /usr/local/share: No such file or directory
make[3]: *** [install-dist_pkgdataDATA] Error 1
make[2]: *** [install-am] Error 2
make[1]: *** [install-recursive] Error 1
make: *** [install-recursive] Error 1
I assume that I do not have my build environment all configured yet. Has
anybody ever written a complete set of instructions on how to start from
scratch on OSX?

I have less than a week to proof that mono will be a viable solution for us.
At his point it does not look promising.

Is there a way for me to get a patch rather than to build my own version of
mono? At this point I do not have the cycles to spend on trying to get mono
compiled I have to build the application that needs to run on OSX and
Windows.
