<PRE>
I have an application that needs to run on Mac OSX that will be deployed to
thousands of Macs in schools. The application is a .Net application and I
would love to run it under Mono. 

I have to make a decision on whether Mono is suitable and stable enough
within two weeks. The current released version of the Mono does not meet the
minimum criteria. (The textbox does not accept keyboard input on a PPC Mac)
I have logged bugs which I have been told is fixed but not implemented in
the current binaries. 

I have search the forums for hours, I have asked for help to configure a
build environment where I can build my own binaries on the latest codebase
but have not received any response in 5 days. If I cannot get a way to test
the fixed bugs within the next week, I will have to find another way to
deploy my application on the Mac. 

I would really appreciate some help on this!
