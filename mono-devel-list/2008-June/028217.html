<PRE>Attached is a patch to allow creation of the SubjectAltName Extension 
using X509CertificateBuilder.  There are some unit tests and I confirmed 
using openssl, System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates, and 
Mono.Security.X509 to read the certificates.

I also went ahead and fixed the IP Address code and again confirmed it 
worked with openssl.  Please let me know if there needs to be more unit 
tests, I would like to believe that I didn't really add anything 
substantial that needed more thorough testing than what I did.

Are there any code freezes in Mono?  Or will this appear in the next 
released version (assuming you're happy with the patch?).

Regards,
David
