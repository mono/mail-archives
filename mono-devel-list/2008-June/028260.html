<PRE>Hello all,

It's been a few days since I first announced it, and I'm still hoping
that someone in the Mono community is interested in a complimentary
license Microsoft Visual Studio Team Suite 2008 with MSDN Premium.
I'm also happy to say that, thanks to the good people at JetBrains,
I'm now able to include a license for Resharper
(<A HREF="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/</A>) as part of the package.  Now I
realize that most Mono contributors do most of their development on
non-Windows platforms, but figured that this would still be of value
to someone.

To sort out who I should send this too, I'd like some help from the
Mono community.  I was thinking of either a current contributor to the
Mono project, or perhaps someone working on a Mono related project in
the Google Summer of Code.

Anyway, please let me know what you think of this idea.  If there
truly isn't much interest in the Mono community (i.e. nobody really
works in Windows on Mono), then I'd be more than happy to redirect
this to another cause.

Looking forward to your feedback, take care and have a great day.
