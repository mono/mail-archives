<PRE>Hi,

We are looking for a skilled mono hacker who can implement some AOT  
features for ARM processors for us.

* Currently AOT doesn't generate dynamic libraries. Instead it  
generates binary files from which the AOT'ed code is loaded. We need  
to change AOT code so that it generates real dylib. This is because  
some devices completely disallow loading generated code for security  
reasons.
Thus the only way to load mono code is to AOT it and store it in a  
real dylib that is loaded using dlsym or simillar functions.

* We need AOT to generate all code necessary to run it. Currently  
there are a few functions which are not fully AOTed. For example  
trampolines generate JIT code. This needs to be turned into AOT'd  
code completely. There are most likely a few other places where JIT  
code is generated on the fly instead of using the AOTed code.

There are some features that we don't need that simplify this task:
* No need for generics
* No need for pinvoke
* No need for cross domain code

If you are interested in working on this as a contractor, drop me a  
mail.

Best regards,
Joachim Ante
