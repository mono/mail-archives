AFAIK no one. The actual class does everything that mono itself requires
(mostly implementing the makecert tool).

</I>
Mono.Security is stable so any change must be forward compatible (e.g.
adding new stuff is possible but changing existing API is unlikely to be
possible).

Also any new features should come with unit tests to make sure any
future change won't break them.

Other than this it's as simple as posting your patch for review on this
list (as long as you're willing the code to be available under the MIT
X11 license).

Thanks!
Sebastien
