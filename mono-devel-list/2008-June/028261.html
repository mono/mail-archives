<PRE>Hello Kosta,
thanks for your reply. I asked myself again what I really need and arrived at 
the conclusion that resource leaks are not tolerable. You mentioned that a 
reduction of the program's possibilities could result in safe &quot;hard&quot; abort. 
What do I have to restrict or is this only a theoretical approach?

I suppose i'd like the program to react to certain conditions with an 
exception within a (preferably bounded) short amout of time. Of course this 
assumes that scheduling and garbage collection are somehow playing along.

To use &quot;soft&quot; aborts and control points respectively in a thread, I probably 
have to make sure that no code is called that has either no control points or 
may take too long to complete. I suppose this also implies not using blocking 
functions (apart from those i can interrupt myself).

Regards,
Bastian Schmitz

</I>&gt;<i> Hard abortion means that it will happen regardless of what the thread is

</I>&gt;<i> since it can lead to resource leaks. Note, that &quot;hard&quot; abort is inherently
</I>&gt;<i> unsafe regardless of the platform you use (clr,java,native or whatever)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Soft abortion means that in some &quot;control points&quot; the thread itself checks
</I>&gt;<i> for some condition and if it's not fullfilled &quot;soft&quot; aborts itself by
</I>&gt;<i> throwing an exception (for example). This kind of abortion is safe since
</I>&gt;<i> the thread controls in which points the condition is checked. In the same
</I>&gt;<i> time if the thread does not reach the control point, it won't be aborted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You may consider &quot;hard&quot;, &quot;soft&quot; abortion or a combination of them (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> soft and later hard after some timeout). For &quot;control points&quot; you may

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello list.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Within the scope of my diploma thesis, I am going to create a (or extend
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an existing) programming language (+compiler) for the control of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; automated vehicles. Right now I am evaluating the use of mono as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; runtime platform.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am planning to have a language element, which ensures that a given
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; condition
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stays fulfilled during the execution of block of code. If the condition
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is violated an exception should be risen. The condition is (probably)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; going to be checked/evaluated by another thread, who should inform the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; first one in case of violation of the condition.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This pattern resembles to the asynchronous exception used by the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thread.Abort() method being triggered by an external thread, catching the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ThreadAbortException and canceling the abort afterwards.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am wondering if there is a safe way to achieve this functionality with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; crl/mono runtime.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Best regards,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Bastian Schmitz
