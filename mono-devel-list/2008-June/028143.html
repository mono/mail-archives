I actually resolved the &quot;GetExitCodeProcess: Can't find process 0x1&quot; part
which was due to the fact that if fork() fails when it creates a process no
exception is thrown and the caller doesn't know about it. Other calls to
Process.Start() will also fail.

Fork() was failing for me because my process was allocating alot of memory
while the fork was happening and mono code wasn't calling execv right after
the fork() leading to a big chunk of memory being re-allocated for the child
process (copy on write).

This is against 1.1.17-2.
