Building your own mono for the mac is slightly involved.  For
development / testing I would suggest bootstrapping from macports (to
get glib and friends), then you should be able to compile mono from SVN
without too much fuss.  GDI+ however requires a little more fiddling, as
you need to have X11 installed and set some additional environment
variables to have everything detected.  I know there was some discussion
about us packaging weeklies or some other duration between releases.

Wade any input on this?
