<PRE>Hi,

I'm a little scared that you all want to fiddle with SerialPort
implementation. The Win32 and Linux versions work well and are
reasonably stable (there are some little fixes waiting in svn for
inclusion in next mono release - but you have very little chance of
actually bumping into the bugs they pertain to). And I can say they
ARE stable because I have code that communicates with more than 10
classes of COM-attached devices, using various transmission modes,
deployed on hundreds of machines. Believe me when I say the code is
well tested.

I cannot vouch for the OSX version, as we have not Apple machines. But
please do not needlessly throw away good, tested code because of some
anecdotal evidence.

BTW: the post that started this thread contains invalid code: it
creates the SerialPort in one thread and uses it in other. You cannot
do this.
And for the last post: it throws TimeoutException. Indicating that a
timeout occured. Do you actually have anything hooked up to the port
that should respond? Are you sure you got the connection parameters
right? Because the tomeout might just occur because nothing is there
to reply.
</PRE>
