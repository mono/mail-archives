I'd consider that an overstatement! No MacPorts is needed for  
bootstrapping Mono, just use the Mono.framework you've already  
installed; you may need to set ACLOCAL_FLAGS and PKG_CONFIG_PATH  
appropriately, search lists.ximian.com for it (try my name, and I  
believe the instructions were from Robert Jordan).
