<PRE>I would probably be interested in offering a bounty for someone to hack 
into Mono to allow ClickOnce deployments work under Linux.

I suppose that I would not require CAS to be completed because the 
assembly would run on FullTrust mode on the client machine, so the 
project would be divided into two deliverables:

a) Allowing to deploy a ClickOnce solution via Apache+Mod_mono, server side.
b) Hacking into the ClickOnce Firefox extension so as to make it 
cross-platform (in Linux, use Mono instead of .NET).

Then, my questions are:

1) How would you rate this effort economically? Opinions?
2) How much time would you estimate for it to be developed?
3) Would the first target (a) allow deploying Gtk# applications or 
otherwise I should create one more deliverable item for this?
4) Which is the best mean to publish this bounty?
5) Would any of the mailing-list members be interested in this bounty?
6) I would probably add to the bounty the requisite of the code being 
submitted upstream to the Mono repository, so the person in charge of 
the project would depend on the reviews of the Mono Team. Therefore, I 
would like to know the opinion of the parties that would be in charge of 
reviewing this work:
- Would you review the work in a reasonable time frame or otherwise 
you're too busy for this task?
- Would it be adequate to give a percentage of the bounty to the 
reviewer? If yes, which percentage do you recommend?

Thanks in advance,

	Andr&#233;s	[ knocte ]
