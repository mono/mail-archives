Program output (stdout/stderr) should be redirected to something other 
than the main server error log (root access only). Maybe viewable in the 
control panel.

Afair, there are pairs of commands that do the same thing 
(MonoApplications, AddMonoApplications), which is confusing.

The examples on the wiki use Alias, and I never understood why that was 
necessary. That has always confused me.

Failures in the module that yield 500/503s should always send debugging 
info somewhere, and it should send it to somewhere that you don't need 
root access to view. It might also be a good idea to override the 
default response page to include the underlying error that occurred and 
suggested fixes.

It should be possible to have autoconfiguration work and use either A) 
one process for all vhosts or B) a different process for each vhost. 
And, it shouldn't be necessary to turn off autoconfiguration to get 
vhosts to work on their own process.

The notion of a server alias is not clear whether it has scope within a 
vhost or across vhosts.

Something needs to be figured out about why we are forced into spawning 
a dozen m-m-servers (one per Apache child process) at startup.

If the mono process dies, mod_mono should restart it.

I don't think MonoMaxMemory, MonoMaxCPUTime work (last I tried it).

That's just off the top of my head...

These are things I can hack on over the summer, if we're going to 
continue using mod_mono and the design goals re: vhosts can be worked out.
