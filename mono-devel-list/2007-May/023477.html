<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Right, and the interaction of that and vhosts is still unclear to me. 
</I>&gt;<i> (This is besides the point, but while we're here-- I have to add a 
</I>&gt;<i> 'MonoAutoApplication disabled' on every vhost that uses mod_mono for 
</I>&gt;<i> anything to work. I tried to patch this at one point, but the problem 
</I>&gt;<i> was exactly as you say, not knowing what the goal was and what the right 
</I>&gt;<i> behavior should be.)
</I>
This is an area where we could use some help from those that are
actually deploying mod_mono installations.  

Your patch had to be reverted because it caused a regression on
something else and I no longer remember what it was.   I think the goal
was for Gonzalo to follow up with you, but he left before any of this
happened.

&gt;<i> Oh for sure. I also didn't mean to imply that progress hadn't been made. 
</I>&gt;<i> Only that based on the benchmarks we see here from time to time, there's 
</I>&gt;<i> more that in theory should be possible, so it's one of many things that 
</I>&gt;<i> remains in the 'open issues' pile.
</I>
Yes, but fixing these is not a couple of line changes, they are
multi-month or multi-year architectural changes in the VM, based on the
lessons we have learned.  

&gt;<i> &gt; the sake of Silverlight, for one because a lack
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of Silverlight in Linux would prevent us one day from useful content. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We all probably thought the same thing about CAS and WPF, if not other 
</I>&gt;<i> three-letter acronyms.
</I>
Am not sure this was ever the case with CAS.   

It is still the case for WPF, but if I had to take an educated guess at
which one will have broader reach between WPF and Silverlight and hence
have a larger value to us my guess would be Silverlight.

&gt;<i> Anyway, yeah, you guys are right that some unpolished things are being 
</I>&gt;<i> addressed and (apprently) Silverlight isn't a major new thing to 
</I>&gt;<i> implement. So all's good.
</I>
Well, there are lots of things to implement in Silverlight, but many of
those will be in the same direction that we are heading to.

Miguel.
