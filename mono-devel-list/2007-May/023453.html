<PRE>Hello,

     On this thread, there is one last thing I wanted to mention: 

     Silverlight has opened the doors to a fresh influx of new
developers that do not necessarily care or are interested about our
other goals.

     And this is a project interesting enough that it will likely make
Mono more exciting to hack on for a few people.
    
Miguel.

</I>&gt;<i> Hey,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think I usually chime in on these things, but this time I 
</I>&gt;<i> figured I would.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IMO, the Mono community/project tends to spread itself very thin. Lots 
</I>&gt;<i> of things get started but not polished up and finished very well. I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't think that's always a bad thing --- in fact, the renewed 
</I>&gt;<i> enthusiasm that tends to follow new APIs from MS, for instance, is 
</I>&gt;<i> really nice to see. And it's certainly not without exception -- 
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop is polished, and impressively so despite the fact that it 
</I>&gt;<i> continues to undergo significant progress.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But the unpolished things include:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Debugging (MD integration, or *some* GUI debugger)
</I>&gt;<i>    mod_mono (configuration is very awkward, problems are hard to 
</I>&gt;<i> diagnose, restarting the Mono process is still strange)
</I>&gt;<i>    Class library documentation
</I>&gt;<i>    Doc tools for independent libraries (we need a proper editor GUI)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (Some may know that I've taken small stabs at improving the last three 
</I>&gt;<i> over the years, and I'm guilty for leaving things in unpolished states.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Other random things that I think are important:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    The new GC
</I>&gt;<i>    Runtime performance
</I>&gt;<i>    Was CAS ever finished?
</I>&gt;<i>    AOT on 2.0 assemblies (at least for non-generic types)
</I>&gt;<i>    Internal testing of the Web pipelines, by having mono-project.com run 
</I>&gt;<i> on the Mono stack
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And that's just what comes to mind right now. (SWF, ASP.NET 2.0, and 
</I>&gt;<i> finishing the existing APIs go without saying.) There are a lot of parts 
</I>&gt;<i> of Mono that I've never even touched that I'm sure have unpolished 
</I>&gt;<i> aspects too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I'm definitely of the mentality that if you want something done 
</I>&gt;<i> in an open source project that's not getting done, you should do it 
</I>&gt;<i> yourself. So I'm not trying to sound like I have expectations that all 
</I>&gt;<i> of these things should somehow magically just get done.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OTOH, since there are people being paid to work on Mono, it doesn't hurt 
</I>&gt;<i> to suggest what I think their priorities should involve---namely, 
</I>&gt;<i> polishing existing parts of the project.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And, besides that, before Mono hackers get too involved with an entirely 
</I>&gt;<i> new API that may very well flop, I think it would be useful to consider 
</I>&gt;<i> whether there are existing parts of the project that need polishing that 
</I>&gt;<i> you'd also enjoy working on.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My two cents.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hey folks,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     This is a repost from an internal email that really should have been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; public. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 				---- 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Apologies for not sharing with the team my thoughts on Silverlight
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as the conference was unwrapping.   I think folks found out about my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interest on Silverlight from Martin LaMonica's blog entry.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Silverlight 1.1 is obviously very aligned with the work that we are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doing, and if someone is going to implement that it is a natural fit for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; our team to do so.   For one, the majority of the work are the upgrades
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the 3.5 libraries (System.Core.dll, completing generics, C# 3).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Today our main goal is to allow a smooth migration of developers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from Windows to Linux (ok, it is not smooth at all right now, you kind
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of have to be a Unix user to do the transition at all).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Silverlight brings another component into the equation: a lack of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Linux/Silverlight will prevent the Linux desktop from getting some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; content.   Whether it will be a big or small issue is yet to be debated,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but regardless of this, it seems that Silverlight is a lot of fun to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implement.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     WPF is too big, and there is very little gain, at least in the next
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3-4 years, because there is no migration strategy for every ISV that has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; invested in Winforms, so the only usage scenarios for WPF were new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; applications, or people that were willing to throw out their investments
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and pretty much start from scratch.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     On the other hand, Silverlight is a tiny subset of WPF, relatively
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; easy to implement (a weekend hack, two at most as it has been pointed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; out by some of you) and it will be used to spice up existing web-based
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; applications as opposed to rewriting an application.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Now, we have a bunch of challenges ahead of us, and it is not clear
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when we should start work on a Mono-based Silverlight, I think we should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but we must:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         * Ship MonoDevelop 1.0, and continue improving it as we wont be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;           a kick-ass development platform until we move beyond
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;           Makefiles and debugging with gdb and mdb on the command line.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;           We keep saying Mono is a better development platform, but it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;           wont be for the unwashed massed until we get this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         * Ship Windows.Forms and ASP.NET 2.0: there are hundreds of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;           people trying to move their applications to Mono today, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;           we are going to need to complete both of these before we can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;           enable the next wave of migrations.   Which is sadly the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;           majority of applications.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;           (caveat: I rather have Mainsoft do Webparts that doing it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;           ourselves)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;           
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;           Implicit in the above is completing the 2.0 profile, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;           determine what we can implement, and what we can postpone.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         * Visual Studio integration: we are going to have to come up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;           with a strategy to get VS developers to deploy on Linux.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;           A major blocker for the VS integration is that it wont be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;           a great experience today until we finish Winforms and ASP.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;           In a way, am ok with the lack of a Visual Studio plugin today
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;           if only because we would not look very good to Windows 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;           developers in our current conditions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;           Once we finish 2.0, it would be good to have the plugin ready.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;           Andreia started a bit of a specification here:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Visual_Studio_Integration">http://www.mono-project.com/Visual_Studio_Integration</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;           But it is a bit of a how-to.   I would want to figure out
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;           instead *what* is that we want to achieve, what kind of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;           experience people will get, and then discuss how we get there.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Considering the above, am not sure when and how we could start work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on Silverlight.   
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     That being said, am obviously excited, and I have done some early
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; research on the various areas that will need work, I have posted the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; details here:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Moonlight">http://www.mono-project.com/Moonlight</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     The name was suggested by Sebastien (who also has done some research
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that I hope he will post into that wiki page as well).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Miguel.
