<PRE>Wed May 02 11:32:40 &lt;@grendel&gt; Dick: do you think it would be possible to write a file analyzer?
Wed May 02 11:32:43 &lt;@grendel&gt; file access analyzer
Wed May 02 11:33:18 &lt;@Dick&gt; how about an aspx-lint that checks for this sort of thing?
Wed May 02 11:33:37 &lt;@grendel&gt; Dick: the lint would have to be either a monitor app or inside Mono
Wed May 02 11:33:42 &lt;@grendel&gt; it's not aspx-specific, IMHO
Wed May 02 11:33:48 &lt;@Dick&gt; i was thinking separate app
Wed May 02 11:33:52 &lt;@grendel&gt; it can affect WF apps too
Wed May 02 11:33:59 &lt;@Dick&gt; anyway, what would your file access analyzer do?
Wed May 02 11:34:26 &lt;@grendel&gt; it would check for cases when an app is inconsistently accessing a file with the same case-insensitive name
Wed May 02 11:34:35 &lt;@grendel&gt; e.g. someFile.txt, somefIle.txt etc
Wed May 02 11:34:41 &lt;@Dick&gt; hmm
Wed May 02 11:34:46 &lt;@Dick&gt; that could be handy
Wed May 02 11:34:46 &lt;@grendel&gt; and would warn about the method, file, line where it happened
Wed May 02 11:34:52 &lt;@grendel&gt; and output a report
Wed May 02 11:34:59 &lt;@grendel&gt; it would be a great aid in porting
Wed May 02 11:35:08 &lt;@Dick&gt; yeah
Wed May 02 11:35:21 &lt;@grendel&gt; it could also look at the disk and check if there are files of the same flatten names in the same dir
Wed May 02 11:35:22 &lt;@Dick&gt; i wonder if it would fit inside gendarme?
Wed May 02 11:35:26 &lt;@grendel&gt; and make that a critical working
Wed May 02 11:35:27 &lt;@Dick&gt; or moma
Wed May 02 11:35:42 &lt;@grendel&gt; hm, moma would be a better choice I think
Wed May 02 11:36:02 &lt;@grendel&gt; Dick: although I'm inclined to think it would just as well be a good thing to put in the runtime
Wed May 02 11:36:08 &lt;@grendel&gt; and enable it along with IOMAP
Wed May 02 11:36:22 &lt;@Dick&gt; yeah, thats definitely possible
Wed May 02 11:36:30 &lt;@grendel&gt; it would take care of all the cases
Wed May 02 11:36:50 &lt;@grendel&gt; you could output the diags to console on *nix and to the event sink on windows
Wed May 02 11:36:54 &lt;@Dick&gt; the problem would be noticing the output if its was stuck there
Wed May 02 11:37:22 &lt;@grendel&gt; yeah, but you can't do much about it
Wed May 02 11:37:29 &lt;@grendel&gt; people must know the feature exists and where to find it
Wed May 02 11:37:35 &lt;@grendel&gt; we put it in the docs and that's it
Wed May 02 11:37:56 &lt;@Dick&gt; personally i'd put it in moma first and the runtime second
Wed May 02 11:37:57 &lt;@grendel&gt; you could even enable it conditionally
Wed May 02 11:38:08 &lt;@grendel&gt; Dick: that might be a good idea for testing, yeah
Wed May 02 11:38:19 &lt;@Dick&gt; it would have to be conditional, saving all the filenames would be time and memory consuming
Wed May 02 11:38:30 &lt;@grendel&gt; true
Wed May 02 11:38:55  * Dick wonders if miguel or jpobst|gone is going to notice this
Wed May 02 11:39:13 &lt;@grendel&gt; Dick: cut-n-paste and mail to them? :)
Wed May 02 11:39:26 &lt;@Dick&gt; hopefully they might notice their names light up :)
Wed May 02 11:39:41 &lt;@Dick&gt; sending it to xml or mono-devel would be good though
Wed May 02 11:39:50 &lt;@grendel&gt; miguel: read what's above this line :)
Wed May 02 11:39:56 &lt;@grendel&gt; jpobst|gone: read what's above this line :)
Wed May 02 11:40:21 &lt;@grendel&gt; Dick: that's true
