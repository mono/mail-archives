&gt;<i> Hey Marek,
</I>Hey Robert,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Even if some people will consider it to be harder, the configuration above

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; advantage of having such bridge (in addition to using a standard,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; well-supported protocol to handle the requests).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> W/out any doubt, fastcgi has a lot of advantages. I don't want to

</I>&gt;<i> newbies, but ...
</I>Apache config is not easy even for people moderately experienced with it :)
FastCGI has more other advantages - tutorials exist how to set up, we don't
have to maintain the module.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Configuring an application-to-mono-process mapping, easily
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to achieve with mod_mono, will become a nightmare with FastCGI.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Moreover, the config snippets above must be inserted in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; every vhost, otherwise the vhosts will share the same
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; mono-fastcgi-server process.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's not entirely true. Please read
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.fastcgi.com/mod_fastcgi/docs/mod_fastcgi.html#FastCgiWrapper">http://www.fastcgi.com/mod_fastcgi/docs/mod_fastcgi.html#FastCgiWrapper</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; With the help of the above you can create a dynamic setup that suits your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; needs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ... if Mono will provide its own configuration manager using a
</I>&gt;<i> wrapper (which hopefully won't badly interfere with other fastcgi apps
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. php) on the same server), I'm fine with it :-)
</I>That should be one of the options. It won't conflict with php since it may use
a different user, the path to the server is different etc. - it would have to
be investigated in depth, but at the moment I don't forsee any problems in this
regard.

&gt;<i> Are there any plans to make the wrapper interactive (a web
</I>&gt;<i> app of its own), like a small application server?
</I>For now we don't even have even a single line of code :) - let's wait till we
have the responder written and then we can make plans for the future. Aside
from that, I like the idea of having a fully interactive control panel for mono
asp.net hosting which would let one monitor all the running apps, manipulate
them etc. - for that we will probably need to implement the monitoring features
of System.Web, which will take a while.

regards,

marek
