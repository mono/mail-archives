</I>&gt;<i> Okay, I guess that would work. I don't know anything about FastCGI.
</I>It's basically a &quot;persistent CGI&quot; application which communicates with the
server over a unix|tcp socket using a well-defined protocol. Basically, what
mod_mono does but not mono-specific and not tied to apache. It's what mod_mono
should've been from the start. We're going to keep maintaining mod_mono, but I
expect most development effort in this area will go into the FastCGI server (no
matter what is the outcome of the SoC project)

As for ASP.NET 2.0 you mentioned. I don't know if you follow the svn trunk
development, but there has been a major progress done there. Most of what was
done will be released with 1.2.4, but the work continues in trunk and we are
really coming close to having nearly full support for 2.0 in Mono (barring
WebParts). If you can come up with any 2.0 apps that you know fail to work
under Mono - please let me know, I'll take a look at them (that's the bulk of
the work right now - finding small/annoying/well hidden incompatibilities and
omissions in our implementation).

regards,

marek
