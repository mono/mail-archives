</I>I know you directed the first question at Robert but as a new user to 
mod_mono, I do not find the configuration complicated once it is 
working.  The biggest problem I faced was that the documentation to get 
a working mod_mono apache configuration is spread out throughout 
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Mod_mono">http://www.mono-project.com/Mod_mono</A> and you have to figure it out for 
yourself.  There is also a lot of out-dated information on that page for 
old versions of mod_mono(see the Paths section, for instance).  I think 
the page just needs to be trimmed down and streamlined.  But the apache 
configuration itself is pretty straight forward, here is mine right now:

        &lt;Directory &quot;/www/mono-test&quot;&gt;
                Order allow,deny
                Allow from all
        &lt;/Directory&gt;

        Alias /test &quot;/www/mono-test&quot;
        AddMonoApplications test &quot;/test:/www/mono-test&quot;
        MonoServerPath test /usr/local/bin/mod-mono-server2

        &lt;Location /test&gt;
                MonoSetServerAlias test
                SetHandler mono
        &lt;/Location&gt;

As far as improvements, the one thing I would love to see is dynamic 
recompilation of code behind files.  It kind of sucks right now that I 
have to restart my server through mod_mono Control Panel page for every 
code update when I am just playing with stuff in a shell.  I do not know 
how feasible it would be to support this but it sure would be nice.  If 
this is a web.config issue, I would love to be pointed in the right 
direction.
