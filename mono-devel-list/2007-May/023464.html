<PRE>Just my 1c (2c is saying too much):

Miguel de Icaza escribi&#243;:
&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i>  * Ship MonoDevelop 1.0, and continue improving it as we wont be
</I>&gt;<i>  a kick-ass development platform until we move beyond
</I>&gt;<i>  Makefiles and debugging with gdb and mdb on the command line.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  We keep saying Mono is a better development platform, but it 
</I>&gt;<i>  wont be for the unwashed massed until we get this.
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>
I agree completely with this item. Many .NET windows devs don't want to
know anything about MD (and consequently, Mono) because:
1) No debugger.
2) No windows installer.
3) Because of the previous one, the interested dev must compile MD
itself and that involves makefiles (instead of being able to use
msbuild, and then allowing to launch it from even VS) and, if on
windows, cygwin.

People just don't understand why they have to recompile a .NET
application to work on other platform (in the case of MD). They think of
assemblies like the .NET way (drag'n'drop to other OS, and keeps
working), and I agree with them.

This is preventing the arrival of potential users and contributors (in
my particular case, I play with the MD sources very often so as to learn
more and more about its internals, but these little disadvantages cause
me to look at this task as a bit annoying, and even for any other
Mono-based application that I want to look at, I *really* miss the
experience that VS gives me when inspecting and debugging code that I've
not written).

Regards,
