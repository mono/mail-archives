<PRE>Hi guys and girls,

 I'm in the process of trying to build mono for windows. Namely, the
dynamic dlls I require in order to embed mono into another application.
Unfortunately I'm having extreme difficulty actually producing a working
build, at least with Visual Studio, which has been nothing but a consistent
failure.

 I *have* managed to get a working x86 dll from cygwin, which works great
as expected, however the application I need to embed mono into is x64 only,
which limits my options somewhat when it comes to loading dlls.

 None of the tutorials I have managed to find on the internet provide
options for building x64 windows dlls for mono. Is there such a tutorial I
have simply missed? Or are there configuration options I have not found
that allow me to build such?

 I am able and willing to cross compile from linux, or use cygwin (x86 or
x64 variants) or even Visual Studio (2008 through 2013) if I can find some
extra information to help me on my way.

(If there is any additional information I can provide that might help you
to help me, please let me know and I'll get that available asap too.)

Thanks!
 - G. Clark.
