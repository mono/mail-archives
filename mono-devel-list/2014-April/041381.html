Just trying to understand the realities Robert :-D

&gt;<i> You're mixing up Mono &amp; MonoTouch like they were the same

</I>&gt;<i> are interwoven.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mono is an Open Source .NET implementation, while MonoTouch

</I>&gt;<i> Mono and its BCL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mono's death, as you put it, would imply that Xamarin were
</I>&gt;<i> sooner or later out of business. It doesn't look so.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
A key component of what I was told toay is that Xamarin are unable to
work on Mono due to contractual obligations to Attachmate. As a
result they are (I am told) abandoning Mono and doing something
else which is the (presumably) VM underneath the Xamarin tooling.

I guess I'm looking for confirmation that either this is true, or
is some strange new form of FUD :) This comes from a discussion which
was originally about Microsoft open sourcing (ish, bits of) .Net.

I care, because I think Mono is pretty fantastic, it allows me to retarget
products my business creates to embedded devices running Linux, and
I want to see it continue and grow. If the &quot;death&quot; of Mono were to be a
reality I would need to rethink some objectives.

Which is why I asked you guys, because I figure if anybody can give me
a categorical answer then it is the developers...


&gt;<i> The truth is rather that *parts* of the Mono framework became
</I>&gt;<i> less important for Xamarin, as they are solely focused on mobile
</I>&gt;<i> nowadays.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which parts these are, should be too hard to figure out.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I became involved in a conversation today on LinkedIn in which a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> commentator was telling me Mono is &quot;dead&quot;, due to contractual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> constraints imposed on Xamarin by the &quot;legal owners&quot; of Mono,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Attachmate.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A snippet of the ensuing conversation follows,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;In July 2011, however, Novell - now a subsidiary of Attachmate - and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Xamarin announced that Novell had granted a perpetual license for Mono,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MonoTouch and Mono for Android to Xamarin, which formally and legally
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> took official stewardship of the project.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It also says as follows: &quot; ...the future of the project was questioned,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> since MonoTouch and Mono for Android would now be in direct competition
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the existing commercial offerings owned by Attachmate. It was not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> known at the time how Xamarin would prove they had not illegally used
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technologies previously developed when they were employed by Novell for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the same work&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the Mono project website (www.mono-project.com), you have three main
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> offerings, Mono, Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android, and you can find a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> link (at the bottom left corner of the page) to Xamarin's website.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It is clear that this is a strategy by Xamarin to offer MonoTouch
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> developers a migration path to Xamarin tools, and not much more than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To be able to woo Mono developers to Xamarin, Novell (Attachmate) and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Xamarin cut this deal, because it is of mutual convenience to the two of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But from any real perspective of active development of the platform,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mono is dead&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This doesn't square at all for me with the near-monthly releases I've
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been seeing with functional enhancements I've been needing, such as ARM
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hardfp (great work, thanks).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Would anybody care to comment on whether there's a kernel of truth here
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or what the roadmap for Mono development currently is?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks,
