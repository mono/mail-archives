<PRE>I actually run Ubuntu desktop on my main laptop and the server edition on
all my servers, and have done for years, I only develop my applications in
VS as (at least from an ASP.NET standpoint) it's far superior to XS and MD
(granted I haven't tried XS/MD for a year or so).

I completely agree your comments about the 2.10.8 version that's
distributed with ubuntu (don't know about other distros), that's a tad
old.  All the sites are run are using 3.x compiled from source.

I've been trying to get mono to compile in MD (4.3.3) on ubuntu 14.04 and
not having much luck with that either.  If you know of a tutorial for
getting that up and running I would grateful as that's a compromise.

I want to actually contribute rather than just use it.  Specifically, I
want to try and help get MVC5 running smoothly on mono so i don't need to
look at different hosting options, or, god forbid, change to java.  I also
want to give back rather than just taking!

I think that a lot more people would be willing to make minor enhancements
to the framework if it learning curve wasn't so large.  For minor stuff, it
is quite a bit of a task to make a change and test it.  That would benefit
both Xamarin and the wider mono community.  I'd love to help out with that
side of it, but I'm completely out of my depth at that side.

What I want to help with is the Class Libraries side, and getting them
fully functional for ASP.NET.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'll have to wait until someone puts a guide together about developing on

</I>&gt;<i> so

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that googling isn't solving.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's disappointing that it appears there is little appetite for getting
</I>&gt;<i> extra
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people to help with mono who don't own a mac
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's nothing special about mac, except that it happens to be the most
</I>&gt;<i> popular platform - You definitely don't need one.  Of course windows is the
</I>&gt;<i> #1 most popular desktop, but people developing on windows usually use VS.
</I>&gt;<i>  Mac is #2, and XS works well.  So, you know...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, if you just want to develop .NET code, and run on mono, you don't
</I>&gt;<i> need to build mono.  The only reason you need to build it is if (a) you
</I>&gt;<i> need a version later than what's available for your OS, or (b) you want to
</I>&gt;<i> contribute to (or debug or just step through) the actual mono source.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to develop the actual mono source, and don't have a mac, then
</I>&gt;<i> until somebody puts in the effort to update the windows build instructions,
</I>&gt;<i> you should be able to do it in linux.  If all you have is windows, you can
</I>&gt;<i> certainly build a linux VM.  (Using Virtualbox or VMWare Player).  I would
</I>&gt;<i> recommend ubuntu desktop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The one comment I'll make is this:  In my experience, the mono that
</I>&gt;<i> distributes with the various OSes is archaic.  It is best, after building
</I>&gt;<i> the linux machine, to build your own mono runtime, and build your own
</I>&gt;<i> monodevelop.  In my experience, this is usually pretty easy, so don't be
</I>&gt;<i> scared.  (Unlike lots of other projects, that often have difficulty
</I>&gt;<i> building from source, I hardly ever see any build problems with mono, and
</I>&gt;<i> even then, there's usually a workaround.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have no knowledge or comments on the ASP.NET side of things.
