Many thanks for bringing clarity to this for me Chris. As we're in a
public forum I hope hope you won't mind me referencing this discussion
now and in future when it is suggested to me that Xamarin have abandoned
Mono.

</I>&gt;<i>     You're mixing up Mono &amp; MonoTouch like they were the same
</I>&gt;<i>     and don't seem to understand how these technologies
</I>&gt;<i>     are interwoven.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Mono is an Open Source .NET implementation, while MonoTouch
</I>&gt;<i>     (now Xamarin.iOS) is a spin-off with a lot of enhancements
</I>&gt;<i>     targeted to mobile development. But at its core, it's still
</I>&gt;<i>     Mono and its BCL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Mono's death, as you put it, would imply that Xamarin were
</I>&gt;<i>     sooner or later out of business. It doesn't look so.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A key component of what I was told toay is that Xamarin are unable to
</I>&gt;<i> work on Mono due to contractual obligations to Attachmate. As a
</I>&gt;<i> result they are (I am told) abandoning Mono and doing something
</I>&gt;<i> else which is the (presumably) VM underneath the Xamarin tooling.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess I'm looking for confirmation that either this is true, or
</I>&gt;<i> is some strange new form of FUD :) This comes from a discussion which
</I>&gt;<i> was originally about Microsoft open sourcing (ish, bits of) .Net.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I care, because I think Mono is pretty fantastic, it allows me to retarget
</I>&gt;<i> products my business creates to embedded devices running Linux, and
</I>&gt;<i> I want to see it continue and grow. If the &quot;death&quot; of Mono were to be a
</I>&gt;<i> reality I would need to rethink some objectives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which is why I asked you guys, because I figure if anybody can give me
</I>&gt;<i> a categorical answer then it is the developers...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The truth is rather that *parts* of the Mono framework became
</I>&gt;<i>     less important for Xamarin, as they are solely focused on mobile
</I>&gt;<i>     nowadays.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Which parts these are, should be too hard to figure out.

</I>&gt;<i>         Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         I became involved in a conversation today on LinkedIn in which a
</I>&gt;<i>         commentator was telling me Mono is &quot;dead&quot;, due to contractual
</I>&gt;<i>         constraints imposed on Xamarin by the &quot;legal owners&quot; of Mono,
</I>&gt;<i>         Attachmate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         A snippet of the ensuing conversation follows,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         &quot;In July 2011, however, Novell - now a subsidiary of
</I>&gt;<i>         Attachmate - and
</I>&gt;<i>         Xamarin announced that Novell had granted a perpetual license
</I>&gt;<i>         for Mono,
</I>&gt;<i>         MonoTouch and Mono for Android to Xamarin, which formally and
</I>&gt;<i>         legally
</I>&gt;<i>         took official stewardship of the project.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         It also says as follows: &quot; ...the future of the project was
</I>&gt;<i>         questioned,
</I>&gt;<i>         since MonoTouch and Mono for Android would now be in direct
</I>&gt;<i>         competition
</I>&gt;<i>         with the existing commercial offerings owned by Attachmate. It
</I>&gt;<i>         was not
</I>&gt;<i>         known at the time how Xamarin would prove they had not
</I>&gt;<i>         illegally used
</I>&gt;<i>         technologies previously developed when they were employed by
</I>&gt;<i>         Novell for
</I>&gt;<i>         the same work&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         In the Mono project website (www.mono-project.com
</I>&gt;<i>         &lt;<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com">http://www.mono-project.com</A>&gt;), you have three main
</I>&gt;<i>         offerings, Mono, Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android, and you can
</I>&gt;<i>         find a
</I>&gt;<i>         link (at the bottom left corner of the page) to Xamarin's
</I>&gt;<i>         website.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         It is clear that this is a strategy by Xamarin to offer MonoTouch
</I>&gt;<i>         developers a migration path to Xamarin tools, and not much
</I>&gt;<i>         more than that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         To be able to woo Mono developers to Xamarin, Novell
</I>&gt;<i>         (Attachmate) and
</I>&gt;<i>         Xamarin cut this deal, because it is of mutual convenience to
</I>&gt;<i>         the two of
</I>&gt;<i>         them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         But from any real perspective of active development of the
</I>&gt;<i>         platform,
</I>&gt;<i>         Mono is dead&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         This doesn't square at all for me with the near-monthly
</I>&gt;<i>         releases I've
</I>&gt;<i>         been seeing with functional enhancements I've been needing,
</I>&gt;<i>         such as ARM
</I>&gt;<i>         hardfp (great work, thanks).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Would anybody care to comment on whether there's a kernel of
</I>&gt;<i>         truth here
</I>&gt;<i>         or what the roadmap for Mono development currently is?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Thanks,
