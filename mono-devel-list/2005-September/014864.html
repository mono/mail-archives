<PRE>Ok, here's (hopefully) my first contribution.  I've attached the patch
to add a trivial 2.0 method on
System.Data.SqlClient.SqlParameterCollection.

It's just that nobody has gotten around to it.

Follow the coding guidelines listed at:

	<A HREF="http://mono.myrealbox.com/source/trunk/mcs/class/README">http://mono.myrealbox.com/source/trunk/mcs/class/README</A>

Place your code into an appropriate #if...#endif block.  For example, if
the new methods are part of .NET 2.0, place the methods into a #if
NET_2_0 block (or add them to an already existing NET_2_0 block).

Use `svn diff` to create a patch file, and email the patch file to
mono-devel-list.  We'll review the code and apply the patches, if
necessary.  If you do this often enough, miguel may give you an svn
commit account.  Even if you have a commit account, you shouldn't commit
your changes unless (1) you've gotten approval to commit the patch on
mono-devel-list first, or (2) you &quot;own&quot; the particular module you're
committing to.

&gt;<i> Is there a definitive place to check the status of what's done and
</I>&gt;<i> what's not (other than the source code)?  
</I>
The source code is always the definitive place. :-)

There are tools to help.  In particular, the Class Status Page provides
a comparison of types/members between .NET and Mono.  See:

	<A HREF="http://mono.ximian.com/class-status">http://mono.ximian.com/class-status</A>

The one problem with the Class Status Page is that it can be out of
date, as it requires a manual update (and thus is out of date as soon as
the next CTP is released ;-).
