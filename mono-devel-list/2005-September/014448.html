<PRE>Hi,

I've done some research on .NET Framework versions 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0 Beta 2
and all of the Service Packs of them. System.__ComObject is internal in all
of them and I don't think it was public is any beta version after 1.0 was
released. If it was listed in mscorlib.xml it was a bug in the program that
generated mscorlib.xml.

I decided not to remove __ComObject as it is referenced in .NET Framework
SDK documentation so many times that the type itself may be used by
developers so it's better to preserve it. And if we ever want to implement
COM interop we have to use this type.

I committed a modified version that is internal and I added some comments
about the class.
