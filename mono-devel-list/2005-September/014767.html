<PRE>If you mean the Benchmark.exe must be built with optimizations on, I have done that.  It runs a 
little bit faster, and on some tests, actually slower, but still not nearly as fast as with the 
Microsoft .NET framework.

I installed Mono from the released builds, I don't compile Mono myself.  I was just wondering if 
I was doing something wrong or not. But, like you said, Mono is still in heavy development, and 
performance tuning (I guess) is at the bottom end of the todo list.

I am new to Mono (and .NET), and am evaluating it for a cross platform (Linux and Windows) 
project we will be starting soon.  Hence, I wanted to double check that I wasn't missing 
something somewhere...

Regards,
  - Graeme -
