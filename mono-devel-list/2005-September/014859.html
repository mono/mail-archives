</I>For the record, I have never been able to do a successful build and or 
runtime in NT 4.0.  I spent about 5 days before I gave it up.  In the 
end, I traced it back to problems with the Visual C runtime dll for 7.1 
that we use and redistribute and incompatibilities with kernel in NT 4.0.

I recall that even though MS has a .NET Framework 1.1 Runtime for NT 4.0 
they did not have an SDK and potentially it relates to those reasons.

Therefore, if you read the release notes document that I have always 
included with over a dozen releases that I had put out, I have always 
stated that NT 4.0 was not supported.
