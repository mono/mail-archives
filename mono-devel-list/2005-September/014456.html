<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> The C++ engine itself is OS agnostic (it works on windows, linux and
</I>&gt;<i> mac), and I would love to make this C# wrapper work under mono, so
</I>&gt;<i> that it is OS agnostic as well.
</I>
Prior to adding the managed C++, it would be platform agnostic. With the
managed stuff in there, not a chance.
 
&gt;<i> Is there any way to have this work under Mono?   Please realize that
</I>&gt;<i> the basic need is to have 1 instance of a C++ exe call into a .NET
</I>&gt;<i> dll, and have that DLL be able to then execute functions in the C++
</I>&gt;<i> exe that called it.     So this requires a mono-equivlant of PInvoke,
</I>&gt;<i> plus a way to have the C++ app call the C# app. 
</I>
Simplest way is to sit on top of the engine and catch the calls in and
out (basically, provide an interface layer). As to getting that to work
I've not a clue.

Calling the other apps from C++ is simple enough. The only caveat is
knowing what platform you're using. If you're on a non-MS platform, find
is mono is there, if it is then just use system(&quot;mono cpp.exe). For
Win32, these should have the .NET framework already tacked on, so see if
it does, then system (&quot;cpp.exe&quot;) otherwise find mono (as above) or else
fail.

I'm not sure how you'd go the other way.

TTFN
