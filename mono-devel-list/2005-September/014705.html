<PRE>Hi,

I'm trying to find if a problem I'm seeing is gcc related or a problem
in some code.

I am compiling mono and it keeps getting stuck at the same place with
the following error (which is reproducible and other are seeing it as
well)

make[8]: *** [../../class/lib/basic/System.Xml.dll] Segmentation fault
make[7]: *** [do-all] Error 2
make[6]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[5]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[4]: *** [profile-do--basic--all] Error 2
make[3]: *** [profiles-do--all] Error 2
make[2]: *** [all-local] Error 1
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make: *** [all] Error 2

Now the segfault is caused by the mcs compiler, which was built from C
sources and compiled with gcc.

Okay, it is entirely possible that the mcs compiler is screwed, but I'd
rather check first to see if it is a gcc fault and work it back to mcs
before filing a bugzilla report to either the mono bugzilla or RedHat.

I'm using gcc-4.0.1-13, Fedora Core (rawhide)

TTFN
