<PRE>Hi Adam,

 

I tried it recently and essentially failed. You can take the recent packages
from cygwin with the exception of the glib. The current version of glib from
cygwin leads to a hangup of the system during linking. But you need the
other files of that package (headers, library linkings, etc.) to build. But
that is where I stopped, so where to go from there is up to you. :-)

 

Greets,

Eddie

Betreff: [Mono-dev] how to build on Windows?

 

Hello -

 

I'd like to build Mono on Windows.  The most complete description I can find
of how to do so is Kevin Shockey's article at ondotnet.com
(<A HREF="http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2005/02/07/monowindows.html">http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2005/02/07/monowindows.html</A>).
According to that article, I need to use a somewhat older version of Cygwin
(version 1.5.7, dating from January 2004).  The article also contains a PDF
(!) file listing the version numbers of all Cygwin packages in that release.
What's completely unclear to me is just where I can get this older Cygwin
release.  I suppose I could run the current Cygwin setup.exe and manually
select all package versions listed in the PDF, but that seems like a huge
pain.  Is there any easier way to download that older release all at once?
Does anyone know whether the build instructions in Kevin's article will
still even work given that a few months have passed and we're now at Mono
1.1.8?  Does anyone have any other concrete advice for getting this to work?

 

thanks!

 

adam
