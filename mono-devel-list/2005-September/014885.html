<PRE>Hi Ben,

During my work on porting some project from Windows to Grasshopper I had
to deal with a problem of wrong case in file names. Windows file system,
as you know is case-insensitive, so in many files there were references
to other files in wrong case. There were almost 10000 files in this
project, so finding all such places was troblesome. Grep made too much
noise and it's output format was not what I wanted. So I made my own
tool, and it turned out to give good results.

I think, this tool might be useful for people that port their
applications from dotnet to Mono as well, so I can commit it for
everybody's use.

Do you think it's worth to have such tool in mono sources? What is the
appropriate directory for such tool?

I attach the source in this message. In addition to this source, I have
the unittests, too. I played in test-driven programming, when I made
this :-)

Andrew.
