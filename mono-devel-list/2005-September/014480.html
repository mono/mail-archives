</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Does any developer read this thread ? If so, could you please tell us 
how relevant our idea is ?

&gt;&gt;<i>Maybe we should setup the first bug day without wating from comments and

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>A dry run? Sounds like it could be interesting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>A dry run, indeed.

&gt;&gt;<i>The only problem is that many of us won't have the needed credentials to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>modify bugs status, so we'd have to e-mail the developers and tell them 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&quot;we think that this bug should be marked as this, we were able to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>reproduce it on the following platform, under these conditions, etc.&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Which is the idea of the triage (from my understanding). Bugs roll in,
</I>&gt;<i>tested and if it fails due to not a programming fault, then it gets
</I>&gt;<i>passed to the code doctors who know it's a genuine problem and not just
</I>&gt;<i>someone messed up.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I totally agree on that.

&gt;<i>As to having the credentials, you're right. In the past I've been part
</I>&gt;<i>of a porting effort to get gcc onto RISC OS and parts of that were mind
</I>&gt;<i>blowing! From what I've seen, mono is almost as bad, but does have the
</I>&gt;<i>advantage of C# being quite an easy language which is simple enough to
</I>&gt;<i>follow.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>By credentials, i meant that any non developer can't modify a bugs 
status, IIRC. This is annoying if we want to triage bugs, since we have 
to ask someone who has the right to modify bug status to do so.

&gt;<i>What I would suggest is this. If we can get one of the key developers
</I>&gt;<i>(Jordi, Ben, Peter, Miguel or anyone else for that matter) and a couple
</I>&gt;<i>of those who understand the compilers innards (patch submitters) and do
</I>&gt;<i>a couple of dry run scenarios (say we take a random selection of bug
</I>&gt;<i>reports), we try and get the faults to occur and then pass them over.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>and we tell them how we would modify the bug properties (branch 
concerned, milestone, component, priority, severity, etc.)

&gt;<i>These faults don't have to be real ones either. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Can you tell us more about this ? I don't understand how we could use 
fake bugs.

&gt;<i>This will serve to do a couple of things. Firstly, it will help with
</I>&gt;<i>time difference problems and any communication difficulties. It'll also
</I>&gt;<i>demonstrate the work required plus give us (the non Novell people) a
</I>&gt;<i>work out!
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Again, I totally agree with you.

All the best,
