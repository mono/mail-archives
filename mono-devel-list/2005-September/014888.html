<PRE>&gt;<i> Hi Ben,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> During my work on porting some project from Windows to Grasshopper I had
</I>&gt;<i> to deal with a problem of wrong case in file names. Windows file system,
</I>&gt;<i> as you know is case-insensitive, so in many files there were references
</I>&gt;<i> to other files in wrong case. There were almost 10000 files in this
</I>&gt;<i> project, so finding all such places was troblesome. Grep made too much
</I>&gt;<i> noise and it's output format was not what I wanted. So I made my own
</I>&gt;<i> tool, and it turned out to give good results.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think, this tool might be useful for people that port their
</I>&gt;<i> applications from dotnet to Mono as well, so I can commit it for
</I>&gt;<i> everybody's use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you think it's worth to have such tool in mono sources? What is the
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate directory for such tool?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I attach the source in this message. In addition to this source, I have
</I>&gt;<i> the unittests, too. I played in test-driven programming, when I made
</I>&gt;<i> this :-)
</I>
I'm not sure exactly how one would use this tool. Can you walk me through
how I would take a typical web application (say, AspNetForums) and fix up
the path references?

-- Ben
