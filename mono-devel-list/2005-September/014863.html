<PRE>Microsoft provides little support for NT 4 because they want to make
customers to update to newer versions. And of course it lacks a lot of
functionality, and they don't want to spend time and money on supporting
it.:)

By looking at the imported functions in binaries I made the following
assumptations:

We are using version 5.0 Shell funtions that require Windows 2000 or Windows
Me and later. (Previously I said IE 5.0 is required but it does not
redistribute Shell 5.0 so Windows itself is required to have version 5.0
Shell.)
We are using Unicode funtions that require Windows NT.

So currently Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 is supported. I
don't think that developers use older systems so I think it's OK not to
support older systems.

Windows 2000 has no GDI+ so please include gdiplus.dll in the installer:

[Files]
Source: gdiplus.dll; DestDir: {app}\bin; Components: mono; OnlyBelowVersion:
0,5.01

And please use:

[Setup]
MinVersion=0,5.0
