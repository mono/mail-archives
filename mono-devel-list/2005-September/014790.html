Great!

The definitive place is the source code.

You don't need an account for your first simple contributions: we'll
give an account to people which cointribute good patchs after a while.
Just send you patches (as attachments since your mail editor makes them
unusable) or put them in bugzilla with a bug report. Always include a
rationale and a unit test case when possible.
Also note that 2.0-related code must be surrounded by:
#if NET_2_0
// 2.0 stuff
#endif

Other than that, there are only two other requirements for
contributions:
*) you must have the right to submit the contribution under the X11
license we use for the class library (so you must be the copyright
holder or you have permission from the copyright holder to submit it)
*) you must not be tainted by having looked at the MS source code
or disassembly of MS assemblies which implement the code

Thanks!
