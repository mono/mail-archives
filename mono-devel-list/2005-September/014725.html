&gt;<i> Now, on to some questions I have regarding the Mono embedded C API:

Upgrade to 1.1.9, this issue should be fixed (at least as long as you
call mono_thread_attach()).

&gt;<i> Instead, I've been using mono_thread_create in an Objective-C

</I>
It's not fine as the thread stack is not registered with the GC so some
objects could be freed under your back. Upgrading to 1.1.9 should not
require this hack.

&gt;<i> 2. Is there a facility to get a MonoMethod* that is more specific  
</I>&gt;<i> than mono_class_get_method_from_name? This works fine until you have  
</I>&gt;<i> multiple methods with the same name and the same number of arguments.  
</I>
See the other reply on the list, or the sample programs in
mono/samples/embed (test-invoke.c for example).

&gt;<i> 3. Is there any way to reduce method invocation overhead past caching  
</I>&gt;<i> MonoMethod*s? I notice that mono_jit_runtime_invoke in mini.c emits  
</I>&gt;<i> and compiles an invocation wrapper with this function prototype:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> MonoObject *(*runtime_invoke) (MonoObject *this, void **params,  
</I>&gt;<i> MonoObject **exc, void* compiled_method);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I can tell, every time mono_jit_runtime_invoke is called,  
</I>&gt;<i> it has to make sure that the MonoMethod in question is inflated and  
</I>&gt;<i> JITed and that it there is also an invocation wrapper emitted and  
</I>&gt;<i> JITed before actually calling the runtime_invoke function. I would  
</I>
Some of the complexity is because that function is also very flexible.
We may provide an API like the following:
	typedef void* MonoInvokeHandle;

	MonoInvokeHandle mono_runtime_prepare_invoke (MonoMethod *method);
	MonoObject*      mono_runtime_invoke_handle  (void *obj, void **params, MonoObject **exc, MonoInvokeHandle method_handle);

You can easily prototype that, and test to see how much of a speedup it is.
My plan is to eventually do it with a different invoke interface,
though, because in my tests the biggest overhead with the current
interface is that we need to allocate an object if the method returns a
valuetype: I'd like to fix both performance issues at once.

&gt;<i> Even better would be if it were possible to JIT the invocation  
</I>&gt;<i> wrapper in such a way that saving a pointer to the compiled method  
</I>&gt;<i> were not necessary.
</I>
We share the code for the wrapper method between methods with the same
signature, so this would require some additional complexity and memory
usage that I don't think is necessary with the above changes.

&gt;<i> Here are some of my informal benchmarking numbers on function calling/ 
</I>&gt;<i> message passing/method invocation overhead on a 2Ghz G5 iMac. The  
</I>&gt;<i> numbers are average call times for nop methods called several hundred  
</I>&gt;<i> thousand times:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Objective-C message passing: ~.055 usec
</I>&gt;<i> C# method calls: ~0.04 usec
</I>&gt;<i> Full, non-cached embedded Mono C API lookup/invocation (parent  
</I>&gt;<i> lookup, etc): ~6 usec
</I>&gt;<i> locally saved Mono C API (using the same MonoMethod* over and over):  
</I>&gt;<i> ~2.9 usec
</I>&gt;<i> self-written caching, using Judy Arrays: ~3.2 usec
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm currently using a caching scheme that uses (MonoClass*, method  
</I>&gt;<i> name, number of arguments) as a key that maps to MonoMethod*  
</I>
The lookup is going to be your bottleneck with the above interface:
why do you need to poerform it at every call?
