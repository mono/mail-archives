<PRE>Hello,

It would seem the entire Mono framework has a problem handling paths that 
contain non-ASCII characters, for instance the acute accent on the 'e' of my 
first name, J&#233;r&#233;mie (I've noticed that Firefox has this problem too). This 
is problem that is somewhat resolved when specifying the proper 
MONO_EXTERNAL_ENCODINGS to &quot;default_locale&quot;, However this proves to not 
always be the case.

I've been trying to run XSP for some time, and I just now realized the 
problem. XSP unsuccessfully tries to create, and access DLLs in the
folder: C:\DOCUMENTS
AND SETTINGS\J&#233;r&#233;mie\LOCAL SETTINGS\TEMP\J&#233;r&#233;mie-TEMP-ASPNET

The folder (and the temporary subdirectory) are created, but there seems to 
be an error accessing this.

The manifestation of this problem: XSP starts seemingly without problem, but 
as soon as you make a page request, it crashes without any error message.


To make sure the problem was indeed with the file, I created a temporary 
WinXP account, called Guest (thus without accents), and ran XSP from 
there&#8212;it ran without any problems at all, and I got the sample index page, 
with the links to all the showcases.


My question is: How can I reconfigure the path XSP uses for temp files? I 
would like XSP to store files in C:WINDOWS\TEMP, for instance.


Regards,

J&#233;r&#233;mie Lumbroso
