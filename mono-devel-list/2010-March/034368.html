As already said I didn't test and can't comment but keep in mind that the
Random class is used (real-world) under VERY specific situations and none of
them are near random. That starts with the initialization to
Environment.Tickcount which IS going to deliver a &quot;relatively&quot; small set of
states in 99% of all cases. On the other hand an initialization with 0 or -1
is probably just about never going to happen (Because it would only happen
for 2 Milliseconds after 50 days of continuous computer uptime).

is clearly an error. First parameter is the argument name, not some
descriptive text.

&gt;&gt;<i> And the unit-tests are no &quot;unit-tests&quot;. They don't test the

I can understand your point, but this means that your ARE testing
implementation against implementation. It might be good for testing if you
correctly implemented your algorithm, but it is imho not suited to test if
it is a conforming CLR/.Net implementation (in fact if you would use it on
MS.Net it would fail completely and if you use it on current mono it would
also fail).

&gt;&gt;<i> And moreover you removed ALL
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Random() constructor tests which most likely are the only of relevance to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> real-world applications.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Yes, I forgot this one. However, there's not much you can test for (except
</I>that it doesn't throw an exception): the 
&gt;<i>state is private, so it can't be checked directly; the value of
</I>Environment.TickCount() might change between reading it 

Well you can at LEAST test all the provided Next() methods with something
similar than you have written.
