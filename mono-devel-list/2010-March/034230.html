<PRE>With the upcoming release of Mono 2.8 we are dropping the 1.0 profile as
developers moved a long time ago to the generics-based 2.0 profile and
because it is maintenance burden for us.

In addition to this, I would like to stop distributing some libraries that
were either never completed and are not being actively maintained.   We
could move these libraries to a separate module if people would like to
maintain them or keep distributing them.

Here is what I have in mind:

* Drop Microsoft.JScript and `mjs'

  Microsoft abandoned JScript, our implementation was never complete, and
DLR-based solutions (all 3 of them) offer better ECMAScript/Javascript
compatibility.

* The ByteFX data provider for MySQL.

   It has not been developed since 2004, it is released under the LGPL,
unlike the MySQL driver which is GPL, but nobody has updated the driver.

* FirebirdSql data provider.

  The firebird team provides downloads for the database from their web site
from 2010;   Our provider was last updated in 2005.

= Debatable =

The Npgsql provider is also maintained externally, but the API that we have
has been maintained in our tree for a while.   In the meantime the upstream
project broke binary compatibility.   It seems like an extra burden in our
team to maintain the old APIs that upstream developers are breaking.

Miguel.
