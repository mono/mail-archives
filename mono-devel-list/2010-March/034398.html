<PRE>Hi,

  A stack overflow at startup usually means there was a verification error
in one of the methods JITted at startup, the JIT tries to throw an
exception, but the exception ctor also contains a verification error,
leading to infinite recursion. Try running with
MONO_DEBUG=break-on-unverified

which will break at the site of the verification error.

&gt;<i> Hi!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm student who's getting started with hacking on the mono runtime
</I>&gt;<i> (specifically on the SGen Garbage Collector). I was trying to patch up
</I>&gt;<i> support for non-aligned nurseries and wrote up some code to generate the
</I>&gt;<i> write barrier for the same (mentioned as a FIXME in sgen-gc.c). When I
</I>&gt;<i> try to test the code I get a stack overflow error (gdb backtrace
</I>&gt;<i> attached). Apparently, for some reason, the control jumps to the
</I>&gt;<i> 'unverified:' label in 'mono_method_to_ir' and the entire thing crashes
</I>&gt;<i> due to some memory access violation in a print routine. Since the
</I>&gt;<i> backtrace does not show from _where_ the control jumped to 'unverified:'
</I>&gt;<i> label, I'm pretty much clueless. Manually stepping through the code
</I>&gt;<i> would be an option, I guess, but I really wish to avoid it in case
</I>&gt;<i> something more streamlined is possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another thing I am curious about is how to go about testing / debugging
</I>&gt;<i> the runtime. My current workflow consists of
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Compiling the code (from mono/mono, since that's faster and I don't
</I>&gt;<i> touch anything outside, thanks to Mark).
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Run mono/mono/mini/mono with some test image (and remembering to set
</I>&gt;<i> MONO_PATH accordingly).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I initially intended to use some real software like Tomboy to test the
</I>&gt;<i> runtime but decided against it because of all the dependencies. To test
</I>&gt;<i> the above code, I wrote a toy program which allocates random amounts of
</I>&gt;<i> memory. I've attached the source.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Coming to the point, I was wondering if I could get some feedback on the
</I>&gt;<i> following areas:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a. How to go about testing / debugging the runtime? I've tried using
</I>&gt;<i> valgrind and gdb to test the code, but could not make very good use of
</I>&gt;<i> it (mostly because, as I said, I'm clueless about which GOTO is actually
</I>&gt;<i> fired). Are there any specific tools I should be aware of?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> b. About the non-aligned nurseries - is *my* code causing problems or is
</I>&gt;<i> the support for non-aligned nurseries generally incomplete? If the
</I>&gt;<i> latter is true, I would love to get some pointers to where all work is
</I>&gt;<i> required to get it working.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do understand that, at the moment, robust support for non-aligned
</I>&gt;<i> nurseries is probably not required, but I figured it would be a good
</I>&gt;<i> learning project.
</I>&gt;<i>
