<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> As already said I didn't test and can't comment but keep in mind that the
</I>&gt;<i> Random class is used (real-world) under VERY specific situations and none of
</I>&gt;<i> them are near random.
</I>
I am not sure about this.

I looked through the svn log for the commits to the Random class, and
I can not find any reverted patches to the Random class.

In fact, I found a commit that explicitly stated &quot;Switch to Knuth
results instead of Microsoft ones&quot;.

Unless someone has some strong evidence and a regression report on the
Random class, I see no problem with replacing our Random
implementation with something better (provided the other issuelets
have been resolved).   But it seems to me that there is a very weak
case for regressions in the Random class.

Miguel
</PRE>
