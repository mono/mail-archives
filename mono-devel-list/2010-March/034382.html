That shouldn't be so hard to fix. Besides, the current implementation has the same error in Next(int) and Next(int,int)

</I>
What would you propose for a proper unit test? Keep in mind that my tests test at least for everything that the old ones 
tested for (plus the exceptions), and are much more thorough.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And moreover you removed ALL

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> real-world applications.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, I forgot this one. However, there's not much you can test for (except
</I>&gt;<i> that it doesn't throw an exception): the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> state is private, so it can't be checked directly; the value of

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well you can at LEAST test all the provided Next() methods with something
</I>&gt;<i> similar than you have written.
</I>
The Next(...) methods already have unit tests, I see no point in testing them again. Together with the test method for 
Random(), this should be enough in my opinion.


Best regards,
Adrian
