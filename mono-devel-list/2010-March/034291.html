<PRE>Hi Rodrigo,

Just checked this on Windows to see how Visual Studio handles this and
you're right, it doesn't allow
the .cctor to be run twice.

However, we need to distinguish whether we're running inside the
debugger (both hard and soft), by
using a custom version of ves_icall_System_Threading_Thread_Abort().

When running _outside_ the debugger, the Thread.Abort() must block until
the .cctor has finished.

Inside the debugger, we need to allow the abort and store the
ThreadAbortException; ie. we abort immediately and mark the class
initialization as failed, so you can't use it.

VS also doesn't distinguish between implicit (from the locals window)
or explicit (explicitly requested by the user through the immediate
window) expression evaluation, it always aborts after the evaluation
timeout.

This means that your .cctors must not take any longer to complete than
the expression evaluation timeout or your entire debugging session may
go south.

So to fix this for mono, we first need to revert that revision
(hopefully getting this into 2.6.3 as well) and then, as a second step,
fix our implementation of Thread.Abort() to not abort any .cctors when
running outside the debugger.
