<PRE>Hi,

Thanks for the response but this does not solve my issue...

It is in the lib tree of the current Mono release build. My guess is
that the build process builds it by pulling in the gettext sources.

</I>
This is exactly the issue, the assemblies that need to use it is
strong named already and can only reference strong named assemblies. I
would love to fold the functionality into  my own assemblies but are
not allowed to do so under the terms of the LGPL. Anyway my solution
is gravitating to not using this assembly at all and using interop to
the unmanaged gettext libraries instead which should allow us to abide
by the LGPL terms.
