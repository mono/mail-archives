<PRE>Obsolete Types in .NET 4.0
<A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee461503%28VS.100%29.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee461503%28VS.100%29.aspx</A>

Here's my 2 cents.

Remove Mono.Data.dll which has been superceded by the provider factory added to System.Data.dll in .NET 2.0.  The Mono.Data.dll assembly has had the Obsolete attributes on it for a long time. 

There are many different versions of the SQLite provider.  However, Mono has a couple of different versions: Mono.Data.SqliteClient which is 1.1 only.  It will not work with NET_2_0 profile unless someone fixes it.  Mono.Data.Sqlite - the 2.0 parts - is based on System.Data.Sqlite.  

Remove Mono.Data.TdsClient since no one uses this.  This assembly is for older Sybase ASE and Microsoft SQL Server databases &lt; version 7.0)

Keep Mono.Data.Tds which is required by System.Data.SqlClient in System.Data assembly and Mono.Data.SybaseClient assembly.

I am okay with old Npgsql, ByteFX, and Firebird being removed.  People should go to the respective project to get the provider.

I am also okay if fxjr adds Npgsql2 to Mono to be distributed with Mono -- only Npgsql2 is maintained in Mono. 

Even though System.Data.OracleClient is considered obsolete in .net 4.0, I think we should keep it for those who need it. 

If no one ones IBM.Data and Mono.Data.SybaseClient, these two can be removed too because they can use System.Data.Obdc to connect to these and other databases.
