CALL FOR PAPERS

15th International Conference on Managed Languages &amp; Runtimes
(ManLang'18)

September 10-14, 2018, Linz, Austria

<A HREF="http://ssw.jku.at/manlang18/">http://ssw.jku.at/manlang18/</A> 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ManLang (formerly PPPJ) is a premier forum for presenting and discussing
novel results in all aspects of managed programming languages and
runtime systems, which serve as building blocks for some of the most
important computing systems, ranging from small-scale (embedded and
real-time systems) to large-scale (cloud-computing and big-data
platforms) and anything in between (mobile, IoT, and wearable
applications).

======
Topics
======

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

Languages and Compilers
-----------------------
- Managed languages (e.g., Java, Scala, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, C#,
F#, Clojure, Groovy, Kotlin, R, Smalltalk, Racket, Rust, Go, etc.)
- Domain-specific languages
- Language design
- Compilers and interpreters
- Type systems and program logics
- Language interoperability
- Parallelism, distribution, and concurrency

Virtual Machines
----------------
- Managed runtime systems (e.g., JVM, Dalvik VM, Android Runtime (ART),
LLVM, .NET CLR, RPython, etc.)
- VM design and optimization
- VMs for mobile and embedded devices
- VMs for real-time applications
- Memory management
- Hardware/software co-design

Techniques, Tools, and Applications
-----------------------------------
- Static and dynamic program analysis
- Testing and debugging
- Refactoring
- Program understanding
- Program synthesis
- Security and privacy
- Performance analysis and monitoring
- Compiler and program verification
