<PRE>I disagree on the small size.
My model names weren't that much larger, even though they had a path.
Even on a small name like &quot;kernel32.dll&quot; it will compare 4 letters 8
times before finding a match.
But i agree on not touching tested code ;)

However, filing this as a bug...
It honestly isn't one, and I wouldn't give it too much of a priority.

Better add a new cathegory, like &quot;non-fatal nice-to-solve performance
issues&quot;.
