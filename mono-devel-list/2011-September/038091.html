<PRE>Good news, looks like I may have found a solution to the problem.

Though I probably need to do some further testing, it does indeed appear to
be denormals causing the issue. After reading up on it online its been a
very common problem for DSP/audio developers and thankfully there appears to
be a simple solution.

This page describes the problem and various solutions 
<A HREF="http://phonophunk.com/articles/pentium4-denormalization.php?pg=3">http://phonophunk.com/articles/pentium4-denormalization.php?pg=3</A>

I went with the simplest
&#8220;On every location in the code where denormalization might occur, just add
1.0e-24 to the float value, then subtract it again, that should fix it.&#8221;

Doing that in just the lin_solve function such as

x[i+N2J] =  denormal + (( x0[i+N2J] + a * (x[i-1+N2J] + x[i+1+N2J] +
x[i+N2JN] + x[i+N2JP]) ) * oneOverC);
x[i+N2J] -=  denormal;

gives constant performance, though I suspect i'll need to add it to a few
other places in the code as well.
