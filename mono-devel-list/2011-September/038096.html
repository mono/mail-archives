I'm on a 64bit machine using 64bit windows, but the application (Unity is
running in 32bit mode).

How would I run it on .NET? As mentioned this is being used in Unity 3D. 

Do you mean create a MSV2010 .NET project and use the code there? If so then
unfortunately i'm not in a position to do that as my experience with C# is
limited to Unity and i'm a bit too tied up with client work at present to
port it over. I'll try and have a look at doing so at some point, as it
would be an interesting comparison but can't give any definitive timeline.
