</I>&gt;<i> Essentially the function has three nested loops, all of which iterate the

</I>I have seen similar behaviour on MS .Net in an audio processing 
application. The slowdown there was caused by arithmetic operations on a 
non-value (NaN/Infinity/negative infinity). Such an operation will again 
result in a non-value, which might explain why the slowdown propagates. 
You could easily check for these values in your code.

I don't know exactly why these things cause such a slowdown. Maybe there 
is some (hardware) exception processing getting in the way, but that's 
just guessing. In my case it helped a lot to check the result for these 
3 non-values, and set it to some valid value instead. It's not a proper 
solution, but in my case helped to keep the application useable even for 
incorrect input values.
