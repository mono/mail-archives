<PRE>Thx for the replies.

@ Ivo Smits 
Initially I did think of Nan or Infinity, but then wouldn't these give a
runtime exception?
I couldn't find any trace when stepping through a debugger, though I didn't
check all 16000 entries in the array. I've since tried testing directly for
Nan (float.IsNaN) but nothing was found.

@ Rodrigo Kumpera
Denormals, that sounds much more likely, especially as the values I got from
the debugger were towards 1e-44. That would explain the performance drop.
Trouble is I've since tried checking for these and simply zero-ing them
(e.g. if(Math.Abs( x[i] ) &lt; 1e-38 ) x[i] = 0;), but that appeared to have no
effect? Indeed I found it was zero-ing values when the performance was
running fine, so clearly the fluid sim is generating some very small values
normally.

However its the best explanation i've heard, it makes a lot of sense in the
context of the code.
