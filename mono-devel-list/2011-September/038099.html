</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Are you on 32 or 64 bits? Our FP code is quite different on those two.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Can you have a run on .NET without the added denormal hack? We strike to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be as compatible as possible, specially when it comes to numerical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stability
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and output.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> I'm on a 64bit machine using 64bit windows, but the application (Unity is

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How would I run it on .NET? As mentioned this is being used in Unity 3D.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you mean create a MSV2010 .NET project and use the code there? If so
</I>&gt;<i> then
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunately i'm not in a position to do that as my experience with C# is

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Sorry, I didn't pick up the part that you're using Unity. Things are working
for you now,
which is important. If you manage to get time to test it on MS it would be
very helpful
to identify if we have any sort of precision issues.
