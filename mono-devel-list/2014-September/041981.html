<PRE>I would have to both agree and disagree with Edward on that...

Yes you need things to be updated and made to work so you get people
wanting to use the platform.  However, without making sure that the patches
meet standards and are considering all the options, you risk the opposite
the code gets worse, there are knock on affects.

I'm as frustrated with the current process as most as I've been waiting for
the MVC5 stuff to be fixed and merged for a while.  What I would say is
though, I'd prefer for MVC4 to continue working as is, than some MVC5 stuff
work and MVC4 become unstable.

You have to appreciate the position Miguel and the mono team are in.  They
have a commercial product to maintain, that without that, they wouldn't be
able to eat (or put on what I've been told are awesome parties).

At the end of the day, having mono is better than not.  Also, it's better
maintained than some other open source projects.

That said, I think that there isn't enough time, currently, dedicated to
code that isn't useful to Xamarin.  They have taken stewardship of a
platform that goes beyond mobile platforms, and are controlling the
elements that are not part of their core business, however, they are acting
as a bottleneck for those.

In short, there is a lot room for improvement, but where we are is by no
means a bad position.

Just my two (or possibly four) cents.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Tru dat.  However,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess I'm actually trying to say two separate things:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * When broken stuff doesn't get fixed, it's a disincentive for usage
</I>&gt;<i> adoption.
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> * When pull requests get ignored, it is a disincentive to contributors
</I>&gt;<i> trying to contribute anymore (fixing things).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is an unfortunate positive feedback loop, which can hopefully be
</I>&gt;<i> broken some day.  I know based on my experience here so far, I'm not going
</I>&gt;<i> to bother trying to fix anything anymore.  My time would have been better
</I>&gt;<i> spent, finding an alternative to mono SslStream instead of trying to
</I>&gt;<i> contribute the fix to make mono SslStream operational.
