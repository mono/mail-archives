There are a few use-cases to consider, if we want to automate any kind 
of best effort.

If you really mean to execute an ELF binary which lacks execute 
permissions, call &quot;/lib/ld-linux.so.2 thing&quot;

If you really mean to execute any kind of script (i.e. a file whose 
first two characters are &quot;#!&quot;) then call &quot;/bin/sh thing&quot;

If you really mean to execute an arbitrary file 
(Process.Start(&quot;foo.xlsx&quot;) will open foo.xlsx in Excel, on Windows, for 
example) then call &quot;/usr/bin/xdg-open thing&quot; - this is probably the most 
useful use-case, and is also valid when thing is a URL, opening in the 
default browser.

Only after those three cases are exhausted unsuccessfully is &quot;just throw 
an exception&quot; the best option. We already recently gained support for 
Process.Start(&quot;monoassembly.exe&quot;) without needing binfmt-tools, which is 
handy. Of the three cases I listed above, I'd say #3 is quite important 
for user tools behaving in a coherent cross-platform manner, #2 is nice 
to have, and #1 is so unlikely to ever be needed as to be useless.
