Thanks.  How did you know that?

Since I look in there, I can very clearly see a matching method definition, and what it's connected to, and I was then able to find the implementation in source and get all the answers I was looking for - But the method definition I was looking for was &quot;Lock&quot; which is quite a generic search term in hundreds of locations.

I'd like to know how I can find that again next time I need it.  Especially if it's some completely unrelated application (not mono source) where memorization isn't going to help me.

When an &quot;extern&quot; specifies the dll it comes from, that makes it completely obvious where to look.  But lots of times &quot;extern&quot;s don't specify a dll, and my best guess after that, is that the compiler / linker / something in Makefile or the csproj must be including it, which could be a horrible pain to track down.  I'm hoping there's an easier or better way...

Thanks again.  Helped a bunch this time.
