</I>&gt;<i> (Please, for the love of $DEITY, do not use WinForms for new projects with any notions of being cross-platform, unless WinForms is a &quot;pluggable&quot; front-end with other front-ends available. The fact that such a &quot;pluggable front end&quot; architecture also makes the app amenable to Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.iOS is a happy coincidence. ;-)

</I>This really suggests &quot;WinForms ought to be made to look better on other 
platforms&quot; instead of diffusing
the needed effort to end users and forcing them to maintain more code.

I see this attitude all the time in open source projects but I must 
confess I've always been puzzled by it.
Suppose Microsoft has a bug in their code. They can take a few man hours 
to fix it, or cause 10,000
people to spend half an hour each on workarounds. They often *do* the 
former, but it's wrong and
wastes finite human lifetime. Some platforms having unique controls here 
and there, sure, but that's an
argument for a custom control here and there, not entirely rewritten GUI 
code.
