I believe a 1.0 release of Mono should, at a minimum, encompass the
following:
  
   - At least one complete development paradigm.
   - Top notch documentation, packaging, etc.
   - Embody the performance and stability that is generally expected in
      a 1.0 release.  
   - A clear definition of what Mono 1.0 is and is not.  
   - A &quot;Road Map&quot; to what can be expected in future releases.
   
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	* When and where should we do a Mono developer summit.
</I>
A developer summit would be great!  I just hope that you try to make it
as accessible by normal people as possible.  For years I have worked for
companies, and organizations that DO NOT PAY for these types of events,
which means it would have to come out of my pocket.  It's very difficult
to justify spending $2-3000(Travel, etc.) of my own money for this type
of activity. 

[IMHO] The Java One, and similar conferences are examples of what not to
do for a developers summit.  Yes they are fun, but they are really just
a huge interactive commercial for whomever is tying to sell there
product to Engineers, CTO's, etc.  I believe that most people that would
attend this conference would all ready understand what Mono can do for
them and would rather have technical and brainstorming sessions.  Coding
sprints/competitions and the like are other good activities as well.

It would be fun/possible to visit Vancouver B.C.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Mono 1.0
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Mono is rapidly approaching maturity in various of its class
</I>&gt;<i>         libraries, the question in everyone's minds is: is it worth
</I>&gt;<i>         waiting for the full .net framework implementation to be ready
</I>&gt;<i>         to publish 1.0, or is a subset fine?
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>         Mono 1.0 so far is going to be a subset, and my current thinking
</I>&gt;<i>         is `.NET 1.0 minus two major pieces: EnterpriseServices and
</I>&gt;<i>         Windows.Forms'.
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>         But today some people suggested that we might want to have a
</I>&gt;<i>         Mono 1.0 release earlier by committing to less than that,
</I>&gt;<i>         something like: 
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>         Mono 1.0: 
</I>&gt;<i>         	C# compiler
</I>&gt;<i>         	Toolchain (ilasm, ildasm, al, etc)
</I>&gt;<i>         	corlib, System, System.XML, System.Security.
</I>&gt;<i>         	ADO.NET (System.Data and providers)
</I>&gt;<i>         	ASP.NET (System.Web.Services and System.Web)
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>         Anything else that is robust by the time the other components
</I>&gt;<i>         are deemed &quot;stable&quot; would also make it.  So if for example
</I>&gt;<i>         &quot;System.Wasabinator&quot; is of 1.0 quality by the time the rest is
</I>&gt;<i>         done, we can also include it. 
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>         We would later publish the other components in upcoming
</I>&gt;<i>         releases:
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>         	JScript, VB.NET (compiler and runtimes)
</I>&gt;<i>         	System.DirectoryServices
</I>&gt;<i>         	System.EnterpriseServices
</I>&gt;<i>         	System.Windows.Forms
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i> * Mono Conference (Code name: Mono Summit of Love).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         Gnome has been fairly successful at running yearly conferences
</I>&gt;<i>         for users and developers.   And these face to face meetings are
</I>&gt;<i>         fantastic to improve the collaboration between the various parts
</I>&gt;<i>         of the project, and help to go over development bumps rather
</I>&gt;<i>         quickly.
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>         Also, it is great to put faces and voices to nicknames and email
</I>&gt;<i>         addresses. 
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>         So am thinking that we need to have a such a summit.  There are
</I>&gt;<i>         two questions: what is the audience for this summit and where
</I>&gt;<i>         should we base it.
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>         Audience:
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>                 We can certainly make this a hacker-only conference, but
</I>&gt;<i>                 given the amount of projects, companies and developers
</I>&gt;<i>                 using Mono, it might make sense to have something with a
</I>&gt;<i>                 larger scope.
</I>&gt;<i>                 
</I>&gt;<i>                 In one extreme we have the `big room with internet
</I>&gt;<i>                 access, printers and laptops' and in the other we have
</I>&gt;<i>                 something more formal including presentations on
</I>&gt;<i>                 specific technologies, tutorials and workshops. 
</I>&gt;<i>                 
</I>&gt;<i>                 I know active Mono developers would like to come (and am
</I>&gt;<i>                 working on getting the funding to pay for airfares and
</I>&gt;<i>                 hotels for those who can not afford a trip to the other
</I>&gt;<i>                 end of the world).
</I>&gt;<i>                 
</I>&gt;<i>         Location:
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>                 I suggested Cancun during summer break, but Nat quickly
</I>&gt;<i>                 pointed out that if you are working for a company, there
</I>&gt;<i>                 was no way your boss would authorize such a thing.
</I>&gt;<i>                 
</I>&gt;<i>                 So here are the parameters:
</I>&gt;<i>                 
</I>&gt;<i>                 	* If we are getting many latin-americans/asians,
</I>&gt;<i>                 	  we should do it in a country that does not
</I>&gt;<i>                 	  require VISAs, so that rules out the US and
</I>&gt;<i>                 	  Brasil.
</I>&gt;<i>                 
</I>&gt;<i>                 	* If we are getting mostly US citizens,
</I>&gt;<i>                 	  Europeans that are under the VISA waiver
</I>&gt;<i>                 	  program and just a few foreigners, we might
</I>&gt;<i>                 	  consider the US.
</I>&gt;<i>                 
</I>&gt;<i>                 My choice would be to pick a cheap city, rather than an
</I>&gt;<i>                 expensive one, and one that has good airport
</I>&gt;<i>                 connectivity to minimize airfare cost, for case A we
</I>&gt;<i>                 have:
</I>&gt;<i>                 
</I>&gt;<i>                 	* Cancun, Mexico.
</I>&gt;<i>                 
</I>&gt;<i>                 	* Barcelona, Spain
</I>&gt;<i>                 
</I>&gt;<i>                 For case B we could probably do Boston, unless some
</I>&gt;<i>                 University wants to step up and provide some facilities.
</I>&gt;<i>                 
</I>&gt;<i> Love, Love, Love,
</I>&gt;<i> Miguel.
