<PRE>
I'm trying to tidy up the gdiplus build for different platforms/compilers
(partly because you need to get through it to get all assemblies to build).
(Note cairo itself needed a few tweaks for me as well but that's a different
matter).

I attach my first set of diffs to get rid of GCC-isms and also just pick up
the headers from the runtime that are really needed (just the uglification
of types...)

What I'd also like to do is rename the library so that it becomes
libgdiplus.&lt;platformext&gt; (&quot;so&quot; or &quot;sl&quot;) and lose the .dll. I'll also need to
remove the .dll from the DllImports in the C# so that then it works
cross-platform. Any problems with this renaming?

If all these changes are OK I'll put them in.

The Makefiles still need work since this part of the build doesn't use
autoconf and I haven't quite finished working out how to handle that yet
(though in some sense moving this to part of the mono module would make this
more consistent but at the moment I'm looking at Makefile changes)
