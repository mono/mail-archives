<PRE>&gt;<i>         Location:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>                 I suggested Cancun during summer break, but Nat
</I>quickly
&gt;<i>                 pointed out that if you are working for a company,
</I>there
&gt;<i>                 was no way your boss would authorize such a thing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>                 So here are the parameters:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>                 	* If we are getting many latin-americans/asians,
</I>&gt;<i>                 	  we should do it in a country that does not
</I>&gt;<i>                 	  require VISAs, so that rules out the US and
</I>&gt;<i>                 	  Brasil.
</I>For just a suggestion as to location, and I will admit RIGHT off, it's a
totally selfish one, but Toronto is a great city that fits exactly what
you are describing.

Huge airport, its cheap because of the conversion from Euro or USD into
CAD.
Canada seems to be a pretty easy country to get into (they let me in
:<i>P). In addition to that, its fairly close to Boston without the whole
</I>US part of it, and there are at least 3 developers within a very close
distance of it.

Again, just a suggestion, and even though it is a bit selfishly
motivated, it is a good suggestion I believe.
