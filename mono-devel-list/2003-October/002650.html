The usual solution to this kind of stuff is to have files (DLLs, fonts,
regular .so libraries etc) in some set of directories, and to run some
caching utility that traverses these directories and checks what's new
and what's missing, and recreate its cache. It's the best way for binary
packages (rpm and deb are really good when it comes to file management),
it also isn't bad for caching utilities (they don't have to worry about
files, just to validate they caches). It's also quite friendly to the
users not using sophisticated package managers -- they can simply put
file somewhere, run xx-cache and get everything running.

If you want to take care of managing files your self, then you'll face
several different attempts of working this around by binary packagers. So
you should better make it optional.
