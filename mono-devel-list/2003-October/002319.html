</I>ok - I must have missed that. However now its great that we know where 
the issues is and whats causing it.

</I>Thats cool. We've had a number of people report similar problems with 
the default framework stuff. I'm taking a look now at auto-detecting a 
framework if the default is invalid - based on your and Bens suggestions.
