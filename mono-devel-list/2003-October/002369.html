<PRE>Hi Miguel,

	While it seems tempting, when we are so close to having most bits
complete, to wait for those bits to be done and then have a release, I
sincerely feel that Mono has been in development for more than 2 years
now and a 1.0 release should really be on time-based priority. 

	I would say, let us evaluate what bits we can provide and set those as
our goals and get into bugfixing mode. Subsequently, following the GNOME
model, we can do a 1.2, 1.4 every 6 months to keep pumping improvements
out to the community.

        
&gt;<i>         Mono 1.0: 
</I>&gt;<i>         	C# compiler
</I>&gt;<i>         	Toolchain (ilasm, ildasm, al, etc)
</I>&gt;<i>         	corlib, System, System.XML, System.Security.
</I>&gt;<i>         	ADO.NET (System.Data and providers)
</I>&gt;<i>         	ASP.NET (System.Web.Services and System.Web)
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>         Anything else that is robust by the time the other components
</I>&gt;<i>         are deemed &quot;stable&quot; would also make it.  So if for example
</I>&gt;<i>         &quot;System.Wasabinator&quot; is of 1.0 quality by the time the rest is
</I>&gt;<i>         done, we can also include it. 
</I>
	Sounds like a plan.

        
&gt;<i>                 We can certainly make this a hacker-only conference, but
</I>&gt;<i>                 given the amount of projects, companies and developers
</I>&gt;<i>                 using Mono, it might make sense to have something with a
</I>&gt;<i>                 larger scope.
</I>
	I would say that given the amount of interest in Mono from companies,
certainly a more professional conference is a good idea. At the same
time, it must retain the hacker spirit to be a great springboard for
launching more ideas :-)


&gt;<i>

	I vote for Europe :-)


	Ravi.
