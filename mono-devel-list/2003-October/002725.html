<PRE>Hi everyone,

I'm new to the list and new to mono as well.  I signed up for the list
because I'm looking for something interesting to work on.  I have about 8
years experience with C/C++ and about 5 years with Java.  I started learning
.NET a while back but I have done nothing professionally with it.  The last
2 years of my life I've pretty much done only java swing work with the
occasional bit of JNI for printing/OCR and a little bit of J2EE programming.
I have a good amount of experience with socket level programming as well.
If anyone could suggest something that would be good for me to work on, that
would be great.  I'm great at fixing bugs and debugging problems so I may be
able to help out with the bug list but most of the stuff on there looks to
be pretty old.  How often is mono updated anyway, is it still being actively
developed?

Thanks in advance,
-- Rocky
