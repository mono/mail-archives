<PRE>I know that the PPC port of the JIT is in heavy development, however 
I've been trying to compile and develop with the interpreter (latest 
CVS).  I have been able to compile it before, but recently I have been 
having problems.  Specifically, I'm getting this error while compiling:

monitor.c: In function `mono_monitor_try_enter':
monitor.c:110: warning: passing arg 1 of `InterlockedCompareExchange' 
from incompatible pointer type
monitor.c:110: warning: passing arg 2 of `InterlockedCompareExchange' 
makes integer from pointer without a cast
monitor.c:169: warning: passing arg 1 of `InterlockedCompareExchange' 
from incompatible pointer type
monitor.c:169: warning: passing arg 2 of `InterlockedCompareExchange' 
makes integer from pointer without a cast
monitor.c:95: warning: `then' might be used uninitialized in this 
function
../../mono/io-layer/atomic.h:350: warning: `tmp' might be used 
uninitialized in this function
../../mono/io-layer/atomic.h:363: warning: `tmp' might be used 
uninitialized in this function
/var/tmp//ccGKMhva.s:239:FATAL:Symbol L_ice_loop already defined.

This symbol is in an asm block in the file atomic.h.

Which brings me to my question, how do those who run mono on OSX have 
their environment set up?  What additional development software do you 
install and how do you install it? (Fink or tarballs?)  I've been 
trolling this list and mono-list for quite some time and I don't think 
this has ever been spelled out.

Not to be pushy, but what is the status of the port?  :)  I've noticed 
that there hasn't been any activity with any of the PPC specific files 
in quite some time.
