Hi Rocky,

and welcome to the Mono community. Mono is still very much in
development :) There are many things one can help with, especially this
page gives you some insight on stuff you might find interesting:
<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/contributing.html">http://www.go-mono.com/contributing.html</A>
You might have read it already.

Since you say that you like to find bugs and debug problems I'd suggest
that you go through all the unresolved mcs/mono bugs (also gtk# is of
interest of course) and try to reproduce them. If they are reproducible,
with a more recent version of mono, then try to fix them, or at least
add a note to the bug telling all of us that this is still a bug with
mono-cvs-DATE. 

Regression tests is the second thing that is constantly lacking. If
there isn't a regression test for a certain bug please write one, it
would be very much appreciated.

If you have any questions you can either mail them to the mailing-list
or go to the #mono channel on irc.us.gimp.org or irc.gimp.org

Happy hacking!
