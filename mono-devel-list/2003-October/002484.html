<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> These dependencies are also problematic on other platforms. I
</I>&gt;<i> can't see cairo working on HPUX for example... indeed is it
</I>&gt;<i> tied to XFree86 only? Also I actually presume if anyone
</I>&gt;<i> is using Windows they wouldn't want an X based version.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The immediate problem is the build system for the runtime doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> easily support building subsets of libraries (without hacking
</I>&gt;<i> the Makefiles).
</I>
Cairo should work without XFree86, you just need the Render and Xrender
packages to build it.

Cairo will also support Windows rendering (in fact, using GDI+ to do
part of the work).

We would like to know of problems people might be experiencing with
this, to tune the setup until its right.

&gt;<i> The next level problem is of course this precludes various modules
</I>&gt;<i> running on a bunch of platforms which may or may not matter to you.
</I>

</PRE>
