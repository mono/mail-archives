I would imaging that &quot;best practices&quot; would dictate that you install the 
.dll in the GAC if you're installing the library in an RPM by itself, 
while linking against the .dll as a private reference if you distribute 
it with your application RPM.  Same reason that you don't see 
applications providing shared libraries in their RPMs - they always 
state that &quot;library X is required to install&quot;.

For those without packaging systems (ie: .tar.gz-based systems), you can 
provide an install script with gacutil-based deployment.

Matt.
