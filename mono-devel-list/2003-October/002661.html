</I>
That's the point of the GAC, it isn't the packagers concern anymore.

The packager should be concerned with getting the library to the GAC (if it
even needs to be, a library shouldn't be in the GAC unless two separate
packages need it), not worrying about how to gets there, where it actually
goes, or anything else.

&gt;<i> I'm not really strongly advocating one way or the other, but as someone
</I>&gt;<i> who deals with packaging issues professionally, if adding a DLL to the
</I>&gt;<i> GAC is error prone, doing it in packaging post-install scripts isn't the
</I>&gt;<i> way to do it.  Otherwise, it's probably fine.  It's a tradeoff someone
</I>&gt;<i> has to make... I am just here to inform. :)
</I>
I would think that it would be fairly safe, the only potential problem I
could see once the implementation works is if that assembly already exists
in the GAC, in that case, failing is no problem, and if failing was a
problem, force will replace the existing one with yours. And remember,
assembly already existing in the GAC means an assembly with the same name,
version numbers and public token.
