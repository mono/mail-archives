<PRE>I thought we had already spoken about this on irc, but I will rehash the
misunderstanding here since you asked.

Because you sent a reply to my original query saying that you had kicked
it off to nickd, and because nickd then said that he hadn&#146;t had time and
wouldn&#146;t for a while, and if anyone could get to it first, please do. I
figured that it was one of those things where it was waiting for someone
who didn&#146;t have time to take care of it to take care of it, and since he
said to go ahead if you had the time, I figured I might as well.

In addition, I said on irc that I had gotten your patch to apply
(something nickd said he had minor issues with, I think) and that it
seemed to build perfectly, and execute the existing nunit2 tests without
any new issues. Then I asked Miguel if it was ok to commit, and having
received his go ahead I did.

My question is why you brought it up here after we already spoke on irc,
and I apologized for the misunderstanding?
