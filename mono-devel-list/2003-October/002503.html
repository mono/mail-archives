<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Thanks for the explanation. I'll try and build it and see how it goes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I did have a quick look at the System.Drawing stuff for Windows
</I>&gt;<i> too and it wasn't quite clear to me how it is supposed to
</I>&gt;<i> be configured there.
</I>
I have not myself built it on Windows yet, but on Windows we should not
be building any of the C code, as we use the underlying GDIPLUS.DLL
file on those systems.

The new foundation for System.Drawing is basically that we implement
the GDIPLUS.DLL interface, so we can reduce the amount of code that we
had to maintain (for those not tracking System.Drawing: we use to have
an interface that was implemented in three places: Gdk, Cairo and
Windows, and it was becoming very hard to maintain, extend and improve,
and the various differences were not easy to deal with).

Miguel.

</PRE>
