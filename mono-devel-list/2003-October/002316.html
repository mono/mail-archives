<PRE>Yes, the DirectoryScanner.cs code is what holds up the compilation on a
mono system.

And this is a reported issue, a couple months ago when I was looking
into using NAnt, I saw on the mailing list archive a thread from someone
saying they got it working, but a compile that took 2 seconds from the
commandline with mcs took 57 seconds through NAnt.

Please, don't get me wrong, at no point was ragging on NAnt, I think it
is a great tool, with some amazing potential, and its very usable now.

With regards to the nant.exe.config file and frameworks stuff here is my
issue.

I understand the need to use that section for finding certain
applications, however, many projects just need access to csc, not the
entire suite of utilities (gacutil, ngen, resgen, etc). Debugging the
'No framework found' error is the most difficult experience I had with
NAnt, its just not very intuitive at all. That was all I meant :)

Thanks for your replies, and your suggestions :)
