<PRE>Somehow, either I'm missing the point of the Global Assembly Cache or
something.

You are suggesting we have a cache of dlls to be cached in the GAC?

To me, that seems like the main purpose is defeated. And that doesn't take
into account different versions of the library with the same name.

In my opinion (both as a mono developer, and as a mono packager, and I am
both), I think that if mono was to have a utility that they say you should
use to place something into the GAC, and I figured out a way around it, and
got burnt by shifting implementations, who am I to blame but myself?

Keep in mind please that the GAC doesn't and wont replace the MONO_PATH and
cwd assembly location methods, it just moves all the .dlls from /usr/lib and
puts them in subdirectories.
