I agree with you that the GTK people could do with a bit less attitude
here.  (Though there are good reasons why the posix model of
any-byte-except-slash-is-ok is tricky to deal with in programs where
everything is stored internally in some unicode format and converted
when necessary.)

&gt;<i> Secondly, expecting end users to know about internals of glib

</I>
Well, maybe.  But:

1) The world does not consist solely of end-users.

2) End-users who encounters this problem with mono apps will likely
also encounter it with Gnome and all the other Gtk- and Glib-based
programs out there.  If they ask for help on a mailing list or any
other forum they will probably be offered a solution in the form of a
magic invocation involving G_BROKEN_FILENAMES.  If Mono goes the same
route, then it will magically work for Mono apps too.

In other words, a solution for this problem will necessarily be
relatively obscure.  Given that, it makes sense to pick the same
solution as other people, rather than invent another obscure
mechanism.  For instance I would expect that distributions that throw
unsuspecting end-users into a gnome session would have the good sense
to set G_BROKEN_FILENAMES appropriately (though you never know; I
don't have the opportunity to check it personally).

&gt;<i> And anyway, it doesn't work because J&#244;rg wants newly created files

</I>
I just performed an experiment with gedit (Gnome gedit 2.2.1, debian
unstable) and it seems that G_BROKEN_FILENAMES is honoured when
creating new files, contrary to what you seem to expect.

I'm continually AMAZED at th'breathtaking effects of WIND EROSION!!
