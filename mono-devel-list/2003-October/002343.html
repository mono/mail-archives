<PRE>I would argue that Gtk# is still in its infancy.

That doesn't mean you shouldn't use it.  It just means that if you *do*
use it, you should expect to (a) find bugs, and (b) PLEASE report those
bugs in bugzilla.

The documentation can always use improvement, but it's fairly
straightforward to map the GTK+ C documentation to Gtk# classes/members,
so you can always read the GTK+ docs if you need to.

As for which to use...

With Gtk#, you stay in C#, which should simplify communication between
your frontend and your backend.  You also simplify the building
requirements and (somewhat) minimize the runtime requirements for your
app (you wouldn't need the gtkmm libraries in addition to GTK+ libs and
mono libs).

You also get the coolness that is Glade# plus
&quot;Glade.XML.Autoconnect(this)&quot;, which makes it trivial to map Glade
functions to class methods.

Plus, Garbage Collection.  Though gtkmm shouldn't have memory issues, if
they used the &quot;resource acquisition is initialization&quot; pattern properly.

With gtkmm, you get a more mature wrapper, which likely has fewer bugs. 
This could save development time, but it'll complicate frontend/backend
code interaction.  I don't know if it'll *greatly* complicate things --
it depends on how you implement it -- but it certainly won't be as easy
as staying within C#.
