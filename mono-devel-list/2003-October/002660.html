This exactly the same as ld.so.cache.

So the definition is wrong. At least on linux using binary packagers,
that handle file management.

</I>
You run gacutil --cache in relevant directories. It traverses them,
and puts somewhere in it's database that file.dll with version 1.0.0.0
(it takes this information from DLL meta data, it's much like soname in
UNIX) is in /foo/bar/file.dll.1.13. The runtime then asks gac library. It
checks its cache and returns proper filename. where's the problem?

&gt;<i> And what about crossplatform.
</I>
This is platform neutral (you just need enough filenames :-)

&gt;<i> When I compile an application on windows using Microsoft.Web.Services.dll

</I>
You seem to unify concepts of file name and library name. These need not
be the same -- that's what's GAC is for (think of directories as parts
of file names).
