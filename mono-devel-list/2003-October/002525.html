<PRE>Hello all.

Firstly, I must apologise to anyone who may have taken offence at my earlier
posting.  My post wasn't intended to be at linked at all to anyone's
problems with xft.pc, but I used that post as a springboard for my own,
since it may have involved the setting of environment variables.

So for anyone who needs to know, here is how you set an environment
variable, such as adjusting a path for PKG_CONFIG_PATH for example:

PKG_CONFIG_PATH=&quot;/usr/lib/pkgconfig&quot;
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH

or more generically

MY_PATH=&quot;/my/desired/folder/string&quot;
export MY_PATH

Thanks to Richard Torkar for his involvement in my solutions, and once
again, apologies to anyone who felt my post was inappropriate.

Jase

Hello, I have been following this thread a little, and corresponding with
Richard on related matters.  Good citizen that Richard is, he has encouraged
me to stick my oar in!  Thanks to Richard for his help.

To cut to the chase, if you want to set an environment variable, you use the
following commands:


That should do the trick.

On my system (RH9) it is part of:
XFree86-devel-4.3.0-2

Anyway I've noticed that xft.pc can be placed in an alternative location
sometimes:
/usr/X11R6/lib/pkgconfig

If that is the case, please add that path to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH
variable.

In any case, I found out that xft.pc is included in XFree86-devel on
SuSE 8.2 (look at the bottom of the file list):
<A HREF="http://rpmseek.com/rpm/XFree86-devel-4.3.0-111.i586.html?hl=com&amp;cs=xft.pc:FN">http://rpmseek.com/rpm/XFree86-devel-4.3.0-111.i586.html?hl=com&amp;cs=xft.pc:FN</A>
:<i>0:0:0:0:875002&amp;ShowFileList=1
</I>
And in that case is placed under /usr/lib/pkgconfig.

Hope this helped somewhat.
