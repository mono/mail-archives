<PRE>Sorry for the double-followup.  Here's how we've seen that Windows is 
doing it:

C:\WINNT\assembly\GAC\System.Data&gt;dir
  Volume in drive C has no label.
  Volume Serial Number is 58CA-79E8

  Directory of C:\WINNT\assembly\GAC\System.Data

05/02/2003  11:23a      &lt;DIR&gt;          .
05/02/2003  11:23a      &lt;DIR&gt;          ..
05/02/2003  11:23a      &lt;DIR&gt;          1.0.3300.0__b77a5c561934e089
05/01/2003  03:32p      &lt;DIR&gt;          1.0.5000.0__b77a5c561934e089

There's no reason this same layout wouldn't work under Linux.  The 
packager would likely run gacutil -i --gacroot=$prefix during package 
build time.

This would create a directory structure like so:

$prefix/lib/mono/1.2.33.11__b3241231232222/__AssemblyInfo__.ini
$prefix/lib/mono/1.2.33.11__b3241231232222/SomeAssembly.dll

The next time, it would create:

$prefix/lib/mono/1.2.33.12__b3241231232222/__AssemblyInfo__.ini
$prefix/lib/mono/1.2.33.12__b3241231232222/SomeAssembly.dll

These files would allow someone to install SomeAssembly v1.2.33.11 and 
v1.2.33.12 in the same GAC, without interference, and without running 
gacutil.

If necessary (the model doesn't require this), gacutil --cache could be 
run as &quot;post-install&quot; to pre-cache locations of GAC files for faster 
lookup.
