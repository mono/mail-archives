Hm, doesn't that present a different packaging problem? Say I'm
distributing MyMonoProgram.rpm. Where do I tell RPM that
HelperAssembly.dll goes?

That is, in the current (MONO_PATH) system you'd have a %files list
like:

	/usr/bin/MyMonoProgram.exe
	/usr/share/doc/MyMonoProgram-1.0/README
	/usr/lib/HelperAssembly.dll

But the whole point is not to put assemblies in /usr/lib due to name
conflicts and general cleanliness, right? I think we all agree that
hard-coding the system-specific destination path sucks:

	/usr/lib/monogac/HelperAssembly/magicnumbers24134/HelperAssembly.dll

But we have to tell RPM to put the file *somewhere*. Maybe:

	/usr/lib/MyMonoProgram/HelperAssembly.dll 

And then copy / link it into the GAC? (You can't move it, since then rpm
-V MyMonoProgram will report a problem and in general RPM expects all
the files in its listings to actually exist.)
