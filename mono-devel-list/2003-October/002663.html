That sort of breaks the model with packaging on Linux, though.  In the
RPM, there's a reference to a file, and that file has to go *somewhere*,
so why not put it where it's supposed to go? :)

The tool to tell it where to go could be done at build-time, rather than
installation-time, unless there's some reason why the file would go to
different locations on different machines (different $prefix
notwithstanding)

Word.
