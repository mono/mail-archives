The io-layer/ directory is a windows api portability library.  It is not
built on windows, therefore the exposed api has to conform to the
published windows api.  Uwe tried to use internal io-layer functions in
other parts of mono, and thats the part that isn't permitted.

</I>
Can you remind me what the exact problem is?

Newer versions of mono should be able to see filenames in the locale
encoding.  It will write filenames in utf8 though.  Would some sort of
environment option to call g_locale_from_utf8() on the filename at file
open do what you need?
