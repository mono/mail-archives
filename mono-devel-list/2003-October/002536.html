<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> And what if... they never enforce their patents?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Try to envision what would happen to Microsoft when they enforced their
</I>&gt;<i> patents, and it will become clear why they won't do it...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, I think .NET is the only good chance for Linux to become
</I>&gt;<i> mainstream...
</I>
Well, this is answered in the FAQ, and is not only limited to Microsoft
patents, but with any patents in general for any kind of software.

	* For any patent claim that is just a rehashing of a technology that
	  predated it, we have no issue.

	* If the patent covers a technique, we reimplement using a different
	  technique.  For example, Microsoft recently had to redo the way
	  plugins are done because of a (bogus?) patent claim from Eolas.

	  Notice: it was not the end of the world.

	* If it is impossible to do this, we sit at the table and negotiate
	  with the patent holder in behalf of users and customers.

	* If there is no agreement, we drop the support for the feature, and
	  if it is important enough, we build an alternative, and a migration
	  wizard.

Now guys, there is no need to freak-out, this is only software we are
talking about, relatively simple pieces of technology.  If you want to
freak out about something, at least make it worth the time: look into
poverty, social problems, economic policies, epidemics, aids, become an
activist, push for a better environment.  

Miguel.
