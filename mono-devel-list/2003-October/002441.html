&gt;<i> I thought we had already spoken about this on irc, but I will rehash the
</I>&gt;<i> misunderstanding here since you asked.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Because you sent a reply to my original query saying that you had kicked
</I>&gt;<i> it off to nickd, and because nickd then said that he hadnt had time and
</I>&gt;<i> wouldnt for a while, and if anyone could get to it first, please do. I
</I>&gt;<i> figured that it was one of those things where it was waiting for someone
</I>&gt;<i> who didnt have time to take care of it to take care of it, and since he
</I>&gt;<i> said to go ahead if you had the time, I figured I might as well.
</I>
I wanted nickd to &quot;say ok, go ahead&quot;. Do you think that after having
everything done to get that patch it would take me to much to do  'cvs
commit'?

It's ok now, but as I told you on IRC, I wanted to wait a few days for
the release that NUnit people are preparing that will work with mono out
of the box.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In addition, I said on irc that I had gotten your patch to apply
</I>&gt;<i> (something nickd said he had minor issues with, I think) and that it
</I>&gt;<i> seemed to build perfectly, and execute the existing nunit2 tests without
</I>&gt;<i> any new issues. Then I asked Miguel if it was ok to commit, and having
</I>&gt;<i> received his go ahead I did.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My question is why you brought it up here after we already spoke on irc,
</I>&gt;<i> and I apologized for the misunderstanding?
</I>
I sent that before seeing you on irc. Sorry.

After this is said, there's no problem at all. Apologies if I seemed a
little bit rude.

-Gonzalo
