Thanks for the code and the tests.
Could you prepare Dictionary_Split_Hash.cs for commit, ensure there are
no regressions in the test suite and commit it to svn?

I think we eventually want to use the nohash variant, but first a few
optimizations must be done in the JIT (see below). The hash-variant is
currently a good compromise until the optimization issues are sorted
out.

</I>
Having done a profile run this is indeed most of the slowdown, combined
with a pattern in the test case that greatly favours checking the
hashcode before calling hcp.Equals ().
For JIT hackers the method to look for is
System.Collections.Generic.IEquatableOfTEqualityComparer`1:Equals (int,int)
there are several issue like:
*) an unreachable basic block is not eliminated
*) a residual null check from a callvirt call to int.Equals() is
present even if we're dealing with a valuetype that can't be null
*) excessive anding of 0xff

When these issues are resolved the function should end up being prolog,
3 instructions and epilog in place of the current kind-of-monster.

Once that is done we can experiment with a change which should be able
to get us the same performance of the current hash variant, but without
the memory overhead. Consider that with Dictionary&lt;int,int&gt;
the little loops over the hash chains do the following:

	while (cur != NO_SLOT) {
		if (linkSlots [cur].HashCode == hashCode &amp;&amp; hcp.Equals (keySlots [cur], key))
			return valueSlots [cur];
		cur = linkSlots [cur].Next;
	}

and the hashcode-less variant is:

	while (cur != NO_SLOT) {
		if (hcp.Equals (keySlots [cur], key))
			return valueSlots [cur];
		cur = linkSlots [cur].Next;
	}

if we always create a hcp object we'll need to always perform a virtual
call (and we'll have the overhead of one more object allocated per
hashtable in most cases). If hcp is the default comparer, the above
could be written as:

	while (cur != NO_SLOT) {
		if (keySlots [cur].Equals (key))
			return valueSlots [cur];
		cur = linkSlots [cur].Next;
	}

which when inlined is:

	while (cur != NO_SLOT) {
		if (keySlots [cur] == key)
			return valueSlots [cur];
		cur = linkSlots [cur].Next;
	}

Note the implementation is now cheaper than the hash variant, the only
addition is a check for a null hcp field, which could be done
either inside or outside the loop (inside would mean less code
duplication and the chains are supposed to be short anyway).
It could look like:

	while (cur != NO_SLOT) {
		if (hcp != null) {
			if (hcp.Equals (keySlots [cur], key))
				return valueSlots [cur];
		} else if (keySlots [cur].Equals (key)) {
			return valueSlots [cur];
		}
		cur = linkSlots [cur].Next;
	}

The other possibility is (with the Dictionary code unchanged)
to inline the default comparer Equals impl (which when optimized
inlines itself the Tkey.Equals() impl) with a vtable check
that the hcp object is indeed of the default comparer type
(useful for valuetypes but going to be ineffective when we implement
code sharing for generic code: it is also harder to implement than
manually checking for a null hcp as above).

Anyway, if Juraj or somebody else wants to try the above changes and
report performance results it would be great.

Thanks!
