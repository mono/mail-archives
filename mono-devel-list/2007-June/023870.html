Thanks for testing.

This doesn't look like what I suggested, since GetHashCode()
would be called more often only in the case of rehash and that should
not cause a 80% slowdown.
Could you post for example the new get implementation? There should be
only a GetHashCode() call for the key, which you need already.

&gt;<i> 2) Separate key and value arrays: no difference (with current GC).

</I>
I guess it would be significant only with big hash tables
and it would show up even with the current GC: say you have
a Hashtable&lt;int,object&gt;. With separate arrays they key array
is completely skipped and only the values array is scanned
for references. With the unified array the current GC will have
to scan all of it. A test case could be to create a few
large hash-tables (no need to fill them, just force the capacity to
1 million entries) and keep them alive while you execute GC.Collect()
several times. Note the total execution speed of the test
with the split or unified array. The test should last
at least 10 seconds. Increasing the size of the arrays
should make the difference larger (specially if the split array fits
into the cache while the unified doesn't).

The only downside of the split arrays are a slight increase
of memory usage: 20 bytes on 32 bit systems. This (apart from the cache
locality effects described above) is largely offset by the wins we'd
have with keys and values with different alignment constraints
(because the unified array entries would need to be aligned to
the max alignment of key and value). Also, given the not-completely
precise GC's issues with large arrays, having two smaller ones
is likely to make its life easier.

&gt;<i> 3) 0 as 'no slot' value in table: slightly faster (2-7%).
</I>&gt;<i>    The change is trivial (i.e. add 1 when storing a value in table,
</I>&gt;<i>    subtract 1 when reading from it) and gives us a slight speed-up.
</I>
Nice.

&gt;<i> If it where up to me, I would do the changes 2 and 3.
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think (especially about change 2)?
</I>
Well, it's nice that with change 2 you found no regression, I think
a specific test would be able to show the differences, so 2 and 3
look viable and I'll still way for more data to decide on 1.
Thanks!
