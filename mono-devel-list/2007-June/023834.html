Well, maybe on windows it does. My 3 year old laptop can execute 2500
processes in those 5 seconds.

Maybe because you have only a single use-case in mind?
What if you want to execute a managed C++/COM app or something else that
we still don't support in mono? Forcing the runtime to execute it with
mono will only get you a crash and worse, there is no way for you to
fix it, because your code prevented any possibility of running the program
with the MS runtime.

&gt;<i> framework classes. One of the strongest tenets of .NET for me has always
</I>&gt;<i> been that the same *binary* will work in the same way on all platforms and
</I>&gt;<i> with any run-time, and child processes being created under a different
</I>&gt;<i> run-time completely violates that.
</I>
The Process class is for telling the operating system to execute child
processes, there is nothing in the documentation or anywhere else about
&quot;using the same runtime&quot;.

I understand that you your scenario needs a solution, but hacking
Process is not it. What if you use &quot;prog&quot; instead of &quot;prog.exe&quot;
as the name of the executable? Windows will look for prog.exe
and run that, right? When you want to test with mono you'll have
a test directory with a prog.bat batch file and you can put that
directory at the start of your PATH environment var and execute your
program with mono: windows will load the batch file which in turn uses
mono to execute your prog.exe managed assembly.

&gt;<i> Are you sure? Even if argc is 0, argv is still NULL-terminated, is it not?
</I>
It is not defined to be NULL terminated.

&gt;<i> &gt;So, the starting point is that trying to execute a managed assembly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;on windows must use the .net runtime (by means of CreateProcess)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;and on any other system it should be considered pretty much a bug
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;(or you should use the linux binfmt registration).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry? You're saying that the use of Process.Start to launch a child
</I>&gt;<i> process is a *bug* and that is not open for negotiation?
</I>
No, executing a managed assembly that way can be considered a bug,
just like not using PathSeparator for directories: anywhere but
windows it is \n, like anywhere but windows a prog.exe is a simple data
file and not an executable (modulo the binfmt registration I mentioned).
And it is definitely a bug to assume that the same runtime will be used
and I bet that this happens also when having different MS frameworks
installed on windows (run a program with the 1.1 framework and make it
execute a program that requires 2.0, or play some tricks with the 32 or
64 variants of the frameworks on a 64 bit box).
