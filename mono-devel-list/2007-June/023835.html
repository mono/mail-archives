Nobody is currently considering making Process.Start not actually start a
process. It was suggested briefly but contemplation of the matter
immediately brings forth a slew of reasons that it is entirely a bad idea.
For example: What process ID would the resulting Process object return?
What would happen if you called .Kill on it? A Process does not wrap an
AppDomain, plain and simple, and people who want the performance benefit
that might be possible by executing the assembly in a child AppDomain
instead of a separate process are free to use AppDomain.ExecuteAssembly.
