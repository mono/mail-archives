For some things it's already required to have the mono tools installed
in $PATH (see for example the use of codedom and mcs...).

</I>
The managed version of the patch is completely unacceptable, IMHO.
It duplicates a large amount of code and it will slow down process
execution a lot for a tiny corner case.

&gt;<i> But it is not inherited. If a tool is running a program which could
</I>&gt;<i> potentially spawn a child process, that child process could potentially not

</I>
It's not clear at all that is what they mean. On windows a managed
binary is always run by the MS framework unless you explicitly execute
mono prog.exe: I don't think this basic expectation should be subverted.
If someone wants to run a program with mono he can simply execute mono
directly.

argc can be 0 and this can cause a segfault.
If we use anything like this the env var name should be MONO_EXECUTABLE.
That said, the code to get the mono binary is not correct (argv[0]
can be anything).

So, the starting point is that trying to execute a managed assembly
on windows must use the .net runtime (by means of CreateProcess)
and on any other system it should be considered pretty much a bug
(or you should use the linux binfmt registration). Since poorly-written
applications may depend on being able to call this anyway, a solution
may be to include this check in the MONO_IOMAP handling, so that only
buggy apps will suffer the slowdown that the check imposes.
