I see.

</I>
I just ran a performance test. The unmanaged implementation adds about 1
second for every 100,000 child processes. Even the managed version, which
is, as expected, a lot slower, it adds less than 5 seconds for every 10,000
child processes. In what situation would this be a severe and noticeable
penalty? Surely the overhead of actually setting up a 10,000 child
processes totally eclipses a 5 second penalty.

&gt;&gt;<i> But it is not inherited. If a tool is running a program which could

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> start at all, or start with the wrong runtime. I mean, I think it's a fair

</I>&gt;<i>If someone wants to run a program with mono he can simply execute mono
</I>&gt;<i>directly.
</I>
Well I've never had that basic expectation. I've always felt that the same
runtime should be used for all child processes of a managed process, and
there are some practical reasons beyond the symmetry of it. For one thing,
while remoting is compatible, it is not perfect. Mono&lt;-&gt;mono is guaranteed
to work, but Mono&lt;-&gt;MS.NET continues to have issues for a number of the
framework classes. One of the strongest tenets of .NET for me has always
been that the same *binary* will work in the same way on all platforms and
with any run-time, and child processes being created under a different
run-time completely violates that.

&gt;&gt;<i> +	if ((argv [0] != NULL) &amp;&amp; (argv [0] [0] != 0))
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> +		g_setenv (&quot;MONOEXECUTABLE&quot;, argv [0], TRUE);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>argc can be 0 and this can cause a segfault.
</I>
Are you sure? Even if argc is 0, argv is still NULL-terminated, is it not?

&gt;<i>If we use anything like this the env var name should be MONO_EXECUTABLE.
</I>
Paint that bikeshed whatever colour you like.

&gt;<i>That said, the code to get the mono binary is not correct (argv[0]
</I>&gt;<i>can be anything).
</I>
Sure, but in 99.9% of situations, it will be something that the shell can
resolve to the same binary that launched the current process. The
situations where it does not are user-error situations, where people are
doing odd things probably intentionally.

&gt;<i>So, the starting point is that trying to execute a managed assembly
</I>&gt;<i>on windows must use the .net runtime (by means of CreateProcess)
</I>&gt;<i>and on any other system it should be considered pretty much a bug
</I>&gt;<i>(or you should use the linux binfmt registration).
</I>
Sorry? You're saying that the use of Process.Start to launch a child
process is a *bug* and that is not open for negotiation?
