And if the assembly (.exe) and the child process are written in windows, for 
MS.Net, but testing under mono?  I would expect that a managed exe, launching 
another managed exe would execute under the same framework...  Just my $.02

I'm just saying that I wouldn't expect to have to include mono... if that is 
the case I would have to do compiler directives to differentiate between mono, 
and ms.net.. on top of that, I would have to create separate executables for 
use with mono vs. ms.net .... I wouldn't want to, or expect to, have to do that.
