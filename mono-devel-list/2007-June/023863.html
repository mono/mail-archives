<PRE>Hi,

I am hacking around, making EveMon (<A HREF="http://evemon.battleclinic.com/">http://evemon.battleclinic.com/</A>) a
cross platform application. Mostly it involves watching Jonathan Pobst
finish  MWF (great work!) ;-) There are, however, some windowisms in
EveMon code that need fixing.

One of the non-trival issues is playing a short jingle after a task
completes. Currently this involves P/Invoking into winmm.dll
(<A HREF="http://evemon.battleclinic.com/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/browser/EVEMon/trunk/MP3Player.cs">http://evemon.battleclinic.com/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/browser/EVEMon/trunk/MP3Player.cs</A>).
I'd like to play the sound in a way that would work across platforms.
I found the System.Media.SoundPlayer class, which can play .wav files
and works on mono. However, EveMon currently ships with .mp3 files, so
replacing them with .wav is not an option. An .ogg player, on the
other hand, would be a nice alternative. There is a csvorbis project
in the mono repository - I managed to use it to get tag information
out of a music file, but I do not know how to play anything with it.
The code itself is a bit cryptic.

Does anyone know a portable (pure C#) way to play Ogg Vorbis files?

Regards,

skolima
