There are references to this both in the instance constructor and type
initializers paragraphs (and also under Field contract attributes).

There is code to deal with this in mini/mini.c, it is mostly complete
(look for can_access_field and can_access_method). Note that such code
must not be duplicated, we need to share it for both implementations.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't quite follow you, I should test it it's a load/store to a class with

</I>
The process of verification doesn't involve just a single method's
code: major things in the assembly containing it must be checked first.
verify.c contains quite a bit of those checks, more are needed of course.
Between them there is the field overlapping detection: it is a check
that doesn't belong inside the field access checks, but it belongs
to a per-type check that you need to perform anyway.
In the field access you need just to check if the type was ok
and the type should have been checked earlier (though it's reasonable to
check it lazily whenever a type is seen, but the full checks for the
type are needed, not just about overlapping fields). So you'd have code
like this whenever a type or class is seen:

	if (!type_is_ok (type)) {
		report verification/validation issues in type
		return;
	}

and inside type_is_ok():
	// lazy check
	if (!type_has_been_checked (type))
		check_type (type);
	return type_status (type) == ok;

With this code field overlapping will just be one of the many checks
performed inside check_type ().
