<PRE>After adding support for setting and getting thread priorities I&#8217;ve found
there&#8217;s one piece missing. Before a thread is started you can set its
priority such that when it&#8217;s started it will start with this priority
instead of the priority of the thread creating it.

At the moment the code lets this happen but does nothing with it. I have
started adding code to fix this missing piece. The trouble I am having is
that the wthreads.c implementation of GetThreadPriority() will simply
return THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL if the thread hasn&#8217;t been started yet: even
if a call to SetPriority has already been made. I was storing the priority
value in the MonoThread structure, however, wthreads.c does not have
visibility of this structure. I thought of putting it in MonoThreadInfo
but I&#8217;m not sure at which point this structure comes into existence. The
other place is within MonoThreadInternal which wthreads.c does see but
this requires a change in Threads.cs which has a one-to-one field
correspondence with the structure.

The other changes work fine such that a thread (running with the right
policy) will have its priority set at creation time. All that is missing
is GetPriority reporting the correct value before start time.
