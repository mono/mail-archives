<PRE>Hi Eberhard 

Thanks for that very useful link. However, I went there to check the
Configuration.HasFile, the very property that is in question and finding it
has a tick mark next to it which to me means that it is implemented and
tested.

But in my unit test HasFile is true while File.Exists(
configuration.FilePath ) is false confused me. Is there some subtle reason
why Mono in Mint producing this difference? Or Mono has changed the meaning
of HasFile?

Architecturally System.Configuration.DefaultSection seems to be different
too. In Windows the SectionInformation property is part of DefaultSection
class while in Mono it is in its base class.

As a result, the 
<A HREF="http://go-mono.com/status/status.aspx?reference=4.5&amp;profile=4.5&amp;assembly=System.Configuration">http://go-mono.com/status/status.aspx?reference=4.5&amp;profile=4.5&amp;assembly=System.Configuration</A>
&lt;<A HREF="http://go-mono.com/status/status.aspx?reference=4.5&amp;profile=4.5&amp;assembly=System.Configuration">http://go-mono.com/status/status.aspx?reference=4.5&amp;profile=4.5&amp;assembly=System.Configuration</A>&gt;  
does not show the presence of SectionInformation property. The MonoDevelop
disassembler seems to be unable to disassemble System.Configuration.dll and
hence I can't make much sense of the implementation.

Then System.Configuration.SectionInformation.SectionName is in yet TODO when
it is the name of the section that the section information is referred to.
So it is an intrinsic part of it and should be implemented. In my test
SectionInformation.Type returning null while the web site says it is
implemented. I guess someone in that class has failed to call Type to set
the section's type string. Hence one can't rely too much on that site and
one should produce learning test to ensure they operate correctly at
runtime.

Is there a better disassembler one can recommend?

It is very frustrating moving .Net code to Mono when it was touted as a
cross platform development language. Code compiles but I often encounter
this kind of runtime inconsistency. It wastes so much time.

Is it just me that is having this kind of anomaly/inconsistency when porting
code from CLR to Mono? What are other's experience? I struck problem in just
about every namespace I have tried.
