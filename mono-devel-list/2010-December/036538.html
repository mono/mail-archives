Supposing that you have a mirror of the production system,
you can compile Mono on this system and copy the binaries to
production.

&gt;<i> All I want on dev or prod, is the runtime for command line programs and the

Well, 'configure' did what it was told to do. Change the prefix
to something like '--prefix /opt/mono' if you want to keep these
bits together.

&gt;<i> I did reduce requirements somewhat by running configure with the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;--with-libgdiplus=no&quot; option as below to eliminate install failing since I

</I>
You don't need --with-libgdiplus=no. &quot;no&quot; isn't a valid value anyway.

Libgdiplus is a separate project that must be installed on its own.
If you omit it, System.Drawing (and other assemblies that depend on it)
won't work, but if you don't reference them, then you should be fine.

While Mono does not provide an out-of-the-box machinery for trimming
unneeded assemblies, it's pretty straightforward to lose some weight:

Configure &amp; install into /opt/mono and remove the
assemblies you don't need from /opt/mono/lib/mono/x.x/ and from
/opt/mono/lib/mono/gac/.
