<PRE>
&gt;<i> I've started new project that may interest you: report designer and
</I>&gt;<i> reporting engine for mono/.net. It's similar to the CrystalReport and
</I>&gt;<i> other tools like that, except it's not this much sql oriented.
</I>
This is absolutely fabulous!

You are going to make hundreds of developers very happy.

Btw, the designer binaries works just fine on MacOS X.

Miguel.
