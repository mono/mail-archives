I have to respectfully disagree that being able to remove major subsystems
that one does not need at all is fluff - major components such as the
compilers, the GUI and ALL of the web components instead of just moonlight.
Some of the current &quot;--with/--enable&quot; options, esp. some of the
&quot;--enable-minimal&quot; choices that are there, feel much more fluffy and are
often even advised to not be used. I'm not looking to remove at a small
granularity stuff like generics, or debugging or decimal features, just
whole subsystems. You either need the web stuff or not. The GUI stuff or
not. Something akin to the V4 client framework might also make sense. There
are a lot of small Linux systems and a lot of Linux'es used without GUI
since they are used as servers. It would help if I knew what all the .dll
modules were so I guess I try to figure that out next so I can remove a
bunch of them for a minimal copy to our prod system. My .02 anyway...thanks,
Dave
