Awsome, thanks a lot.  

I seemed to be cross-compiling successfully for Windows on SuSE 11.3 using a
Virtual Box image.  I accidentally deleted the snapshot with the build
configuration and now after setting up the build environment again the build
does not seem to go the same.  libmono-2.0.dll is not built, but there is an
libmono-2.0.a that goes into the mono-2.8.1-tarball-rrUNKNOWN/lib directory. 
When running in Windows, the libmono-2.0.a is not even loaded.  I though
mono needed this library.

Both builds (the one before I screwed up my build environment, and one
afterwards) from SuSE 11.3 seem to work on Windows, but I am leery of a
process that is not reproducible.  I got both builds to work on windows, but
the first needs libmono-2.0.dll to run.  Why is libmono-2.0.dll not being
built?

Do I need to set a PKG_CONGIC_PATH environment variable?  I thought the
build-mingw32.sh script took care of all of that.

I would also like to try building on Windows under Cygwin, but I had a
stable SuSE 11.3 Cross Compilation enviroment that seemed to work.  I set it
up according to
