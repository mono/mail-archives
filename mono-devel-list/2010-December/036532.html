Sorry for cross posting but I think I should have posted this in the dev
forum in the first place.

I'm a .NET Windows guy and not a guru on Linux but with Justin Malcom's help
I have the latest 2.8.1 mono installed on an older RHEL45 dev system and it
seems to be working quite well and is quite fast. In order for me to be able
to run on our prod system I would like a minimal runtime only install or
identify what I can minimally copy from our dev machine. I won't be allowed
to add all the source and do the large build on prod like I did on dev.

All I want on dev or prod, is the runtime for command line programs and the
debugger. No compilers, probably no other tools, no web or gui stuff - I
only need to be able to run and debug command line pgms and have the typical
common non-gui non-web class libraries available. Ideally I could pick and
choose what I wanted to build and/or install.

I was somewhat amazed at how much stuff was installed. Ideally it would have
been isolated into a /mono/bin directory instead of adding to /usr/bin.
Perhaps the configure program's --prefix option would do that?

I did reduce requirements somewhat by running configure with the
&quot;--with-libgdiplus=no&quot; option as below to eliminate install failing since I
did not have the gdi prereq, but I am hoping for some suggestions on how to
really pare it down.

./configure --with-libgdiplus=no --prefix=/usr &amp;&amp;make &amp;&amp; make install

Thanks, Dave
