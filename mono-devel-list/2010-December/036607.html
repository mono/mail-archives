I downloaded the source ball and built on my system so there is a lot of
stuff there that is not needed by the runtime - I should think the whole
mono-2.8 branch at minimum. I don't even see anything called xulrunner in
the whole tree but did not build libgdiplus so it may have been there.

Also there are lots of 2.0, 3.5 and compat and doc directories and files,
the include dir and more.

The documentation that describes the assembly search order, that says all
assemblies are in the GAC is wrong then if other directories are needed to
find needed assemblies to run your program besides the GAC dir.

Hate to be a pain on this but it seems the hierarchy created by make and
install could be reorganized much better to be able to zip up what was
needed for a runtime for a particular .NET release even if the whole
framework and not pared down minus web and GUI stuff which I don't need. In
Windows the assemblies are under a version dir and in mono the assembly
versions are under a common dir by assembly type though maybe there is a
good reason for that which I don't know. My .02 anyway and can't imagine I'm
the only one that would like to more easily put the runtime on a machine
without all the source, doc and other stuff in the 1.2G total tree.

Thanks, Dave
