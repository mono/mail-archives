<PRE>hi,

First thing i want to say is: thanks for feedback!
This kind of emails give me a better view of what people think is
important.

&gt;<i> Interesting project.
</I>&gt;<i> Adding Excel &amp; CSV support would be no1 requirements for production usage.
</I>&gt;<i> You could use this library, it's the only FOSS excel library that really
</I>&gt;<i> works:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://epplus.codeplex.com/">http://epplus.codeplex.com/</A>
</I>
Didn't know about that project. I've to take a look on that. 

[..]
&gt;<i> Also take into consideration that the designer is not all.
</I>&gt;<i> For production use, the RENDERING ENGINE must SCALE.
</I>&gt;<i> Crystal Reports really doesn't, which is why Microsoft crated
</I>&gt;<i> ReportingService.
</I>&gt;<i> If it doesn't scale, you can have the best designer in the world, and it
</I>&gt;<i> will still be relatively worthless.
</I>
I will beat them all, i promise, but give me some time :)

[...]
&gt;<i> Since it would be a cross-platform tool, support for the OpenOffice
</I>&gt;<i> file-format rendering would be great.
</I>&gt;<i> But...
</I>&gt;<i> Doing it differently (=incompatible to ms reporting service) also means
</I>&gt;<i> nobody is going to switch over, because it would mean redoing all
</I>&gt;<i> reports, which is too expensive if you have to pay the developer time...
</I>
There is a big set of things people requested i think that i will make a
pool after first release, to see what people want most.

But in general i really don't believe in sql oriented tools these days. 
All modern data access libraries are object oriented (NH, linqTo*, EF),
and so is Monoreports's input (IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; - for details and simple
class for parameters). So you can push NH, EF or LinqTo* objects as a
datasource, and all public properties could be used in report.

My final request is to move all Monoreports's related discussion to it's
own group ( <A HREF="http://groups.google.com/group/monoreports">http://groups.google.com/group/monoreports</A> ) since not all
people here might be interested in.

cheers,

Tomasz Kubacki
