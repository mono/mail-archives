<PRE>The absolute bare minimum you need to run a Mono app (hello world) is 
the runtime (mono) and mscorlib.dll.

Anything past that depends on what your application uses.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So anyway, I might then think all I needed was (prefix=/usr/mono) -
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/mono/bin - for the mono program
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/mono/lib/mono/gac - for all the 4.0 system assemblies except my own and
</I>&gt;<i> 3rd party
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/mono/lib/mono/4.0 - for mscorlib.dll
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and that should be sufficient to run my command line mono app.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is it? I did not delete several /usr/mono directories to test that theory.
</I>&gt;<i> To run a command line 4.0 app, do I need anything besides the above 3
</I>&gt;<i> directories?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, someone suggested just ship what is referenced by my pgm which makes
</I>&gt;<i> sense but for example, mscorlib.dll is not referenced in my VS2010 built
</I>&gt;<i> project (in fact I deleted ALL references in the VS2010 references section)
</I>&gt;<i> yet mscorlib.dll is in fact needed and is NOT in the GAC but rather found in
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/mono/lib/mono/4.0.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I could experiment, and delete files and directories to see what works and
</I>&gt;<i> what does not but I think a true need would be served by having some script
</I>&gt;<i> or whatever package up a runtime either based on your exe or on general
</I>&gt;<i> requirements, or even just ALL of the runtime would be better than
</I>&gt;<i> distributing all of the 1.2G of files including source, compilers etc.
</I>&gt;<i> resulting from the build.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All suggestions appreciated. Maybe this is not a problem for some but I have
</I>&gt;<i> to think there are other developers in the same boat as myself not wanting
</I>&gt;<i> to cut away all the parts that don't look like a runtime.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks, Dave
