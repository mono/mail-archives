These options are *really* useful. A lot of work was invested
to make *runtime's footprint* customizable. This does not apply to the
class libs because it's trivial for (embedded systems) developers
to remove functionality. There are even tools (linker) that remove
unused code from assemblies...

We're actually speaking about *trivial* customizations that are
as simple as:

find /opt/mono -name &quot;System.Web*&quot; -delete
find /opt/mono -name &quot;System.Drawing*&quot; -delete

It's really not worthwhile to argue about 20-30MB given that
you're not even working on an embedded system.
