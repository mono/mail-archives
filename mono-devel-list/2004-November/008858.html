<PRE>Hello Ben,

&gt;<i> Good luck, guys.  The svn developers really want you guys to be happy;  
</I>&gt;<i> Mono is a high profile project, so if svn works out for you, it makes 
</I>&gt;<i> us look good too.  :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Remember that #svn isn't the only way to get advice or help.  
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">dev at subversion.tigris.org</A> and <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">users at subversion.tigris.org</A> reaches a 
</I>&gt;<i> much larger audience of svn experts... feel free to write with 
</I>&gt;<i> questions.

Thanks to everyone for hand-holding us through this process.

I can say that the migration was painless, considering that we almost
did not have to read any documentation for the migration.

We will write down the issues that we encountered (minimal as we now
know) hoping that they are useful to other projects migrating.

As I said, I think that Mono was unique in that since its conception we
had half of our developers using Windows and another half using Unix
checking into the repository their native files, which we do not
anticipate many other projects to have.

</PRE>
