True enough.

Path.GetFullPath() actually interacts with the underlying filesystem,
though, so the problem becomes more one of finding the closest
logically-consistent *existing* path leading up to the specified file. I
suggest that it would be best to first try for a path separated by '/'s
only. If that fails to produce ANY matching path components, try separating
by '\'s as well. If that DOES produce matching components, then use that
interpretation (i.e., translate the '\'s into '/'s for File.Open and such).
If it does not, however, I think it'd be best to make no assumptions about
the quality of the program and simply leave the string alone (that is,
append it to the current path as a relative subpath, using only the
platform's standard directory separator char(s)).

In pseudocode, this might be expressed as:

public static string GetFullPath(string path)
{
  if ('path' does not contain at least one existing component
      when only '/' is a separator)
    if ('path' *does* contain at least one existing component
        when both '/' and '\' are separators)
      return GetFullPath(path.Replace(@&quot;\&quot;, &quot;/&quot;);
    // else flow into the rest of the code

  attach 'path' onto current working directory;

  return the resulting absolute path;
}
