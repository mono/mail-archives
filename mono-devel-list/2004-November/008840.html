<PRE> Hello,
My mono version is still 0.25 and 0.26.
With typing &quot;mono --version&quot;, it shows &quot;Mono JIT compiler version 0.25.&quot;

Current stable version of MONO is 1.0.4. Is that &quot;1.0.4&quot; also a
version of JIT or version of MONO itself? I mean, Has JIT itself
(compilation and optimization technique..) been updated a lot since
0.25 and 0.26?
I'm asking this question because i remember that Ximian was planning
to replace JIT with a new one but I don't know with which MONO version
that new JIT works .

How about MINT? The size of interp.c in both versions(0.25 and 1.0.4)
is different. Is MINT still being evolved?

I apologize if my question is very stupid..

Thanks a lot.

</PRE>
