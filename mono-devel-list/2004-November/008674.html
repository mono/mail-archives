<PRE>Libgdiplus 1.0.2 as downloaded from the mono site does
NOT have an autogen.sh script.  However the README for
libgdiplus just had to do a ./configure
--prefix=YOURPREFIX.  I used /usr/bin for the prefix. 

   NOTE that when I compile the libgdiplus/tests
directory, there is problems.  I get
   Undefined symbols - dlsym, dlopen, dlclose -
../src/libs/libgdiplus.a(gdip_win32.o)  Symobol
belongs to implicit dependency /usr/lib/libdl.so.1
   Thought this problem might be related but wasn't
sure.
  I removed all gdiplus.dll files.  Made sure that
/usr/bin/lib was in my path - which is were the
libgdiplus.so is located which is actually a link to
libgdiplus.so.0.0.0
   Seemed funny that 
   Mono-INFO:failed to load AOT module
/usr/local/lib/mono/2.0/mscorlib.dll.so: ld.so.1:
where there is no file called mscorlib.dll.so.
