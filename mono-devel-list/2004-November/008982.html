<PRE>Hello,

Some really nice guys want me to publish incomplete patch for mcs /doc.
Thank you. So here it is:
<A HREF="http://primates.ximian.com/~atsushi/mcs-doc-patches/mcs-doc-20041122.diff">http://primates.ximian.com/~atsushi/mcs-doc-patches/mcs-doc-20041122.diff</A>

Actually it passes most of the tests I wrote and I still need to write
Makefile script bits in mcs/tests and true ChangeLogs. I'll post it
in cpl days (tomorrow is, and today was, off though).

There are some tasks (any of) you can help:

	- Improve mcs to handle precise location information for
	  each tokens including xml documentation lines, which
	  might result in improvements on jay.
	- Keep track of every comment locations based on the
	  information above, so that it can handle invalid comments
	  really precisely (it is mostly precise though).
	- List up all the allowed and expected syntax for &quot;cref&quot;
	  attribute value (in &quot;see&quot; and/or &quot;seealso&quot; attributes)

I would appreciate you nice guys' help. Thanks in advance.

And sorry to be late nearly one week later than I said before. I could
not work on it for a while during migrations and some blockers (they
were not up to one week, so I was purely late).

Atsushi Eno
