<PRE>Hi,

</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I have the same problem. The problem is caused by new harness.mk

Thanks, Marek, for debugging this.  I create the links to avoid some
work :-)

Basically, the idea was to allow 'make run-test' to take advantage of
parallel makes.  I wanted to take it one more step and allow 'make
run-test's from multiple profiles to be run in parallel.  That means we
shouldn't create any object files in the tests/ directory, but in a
profile-specific directory.  The problem is that we &quot;don't know&quot; the
extension of the file to be created (see below), and so we can't use
/out:.

File-specific '// Compiler options:' comments can be used to generate
dll or .netmodule instead of .exe.  We can grovel through the compiler
options and figure out the extension, but I wanted to avoid this work.
Anyway, will fix this one soon.

- Hari
