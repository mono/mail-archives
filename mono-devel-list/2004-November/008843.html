<PRE>Good luck, guys.  The svn developers really want you guys to be happy;  
Mono is a high profile project, so if svn works out for you, it makes 
us look good too.  :-)

Remember that #svn isn't the only way to get advice or help.  
<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">dev at subversion.tigris.org</A> and <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">users at subversion.tigris.org</A> reaches a 
much larger audience of svn experts... feel free to write with 
questions.
