I'd like to give thanks to two people on #svn who went out of their way
to assist me when I was trying to track this down.

sabor, who volunteered to fix up a python script that he had in order to
remove all the CRLF's we had in our repo since the dawn of time. He
stayed up until way, way past when he wanted to go to sleep in order to
debug the script that we were working on. Being asked `can you make a
script that will fix up our 4.7 GB repository' is quite a daunting
question. Not many would volunteer. Although we ended up not using the
script for now, hopefully in the future we will be able to use it.

sussman, who answered all questions with great insight. sussman, I know
that you find our way of doing things (changelogs, avoiding the need to
do 2 annotates at the cost of mixed line endings). Thank you for helping
us choose our own path. You have been a great help on every question I
have asked.

Both of you been a great help. I am sure the rest of the team joins me
in giving you a huge thanks.

-- Ben
