<PRE>Hi,

When you compiled mono, what exactly did you pass into autogen.sh? By
that, did you type ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --with-preview or
something else.

The following looks odd

&gt;<i> Mono-INFO: DllImport loading: 'gdiplus.dll'.
</I>&gt;<i> Mono-INFO: DllImport error loading library 'ld.so.1:
</I>&gt;<i> mono: fatal: /usr/lib/gdiplus.dll: unknown file type'.
</I>
Is this gdiplus.dll one which you have compiled or one you downloaded
off the net and placed in there? What is actually being looked for (or
should be getting looked for!) is libgdiplus.so.0 (or whatever version
number it has)

What should be happening is that DllImport looks up LD_CONFIG_PATH for
the first instance of libgdiplus.so. If, when you compiled cairo and
libgdi, you didn't put anything after ./autogen.sh, both will have been
installed in /usr/local/lib.

You've said before that you had downloaded from the web a dll called
gdiplus and put it in a couple of places. Did you get rid of *every*
copy of it?

TTFN

Paul
