<PRE>I just realised my reply went direct and I didn't CC the list.  So here
is a copy just in case anyone runs in to similar problems.

I forgot to mention that things work fine if I compile a test app and
run it under Mono directly.

I've made the test available here:
<A HREF="http://ozhmx0.ozhosting.com/services/Test.asmx">http://ozhmx0.ozhosting.com/services/Test.asmx</A>


It returns an internal server error.

Strangely enough another method in the original service crashes slightly
differently in that it returns the error within the services test form
webpage as follows:
=====================
The web service returned the following result:


&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN&quot;&gt; &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;200 OK&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt;OK&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;The server
encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to
complete your request.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please contact the server administrator,
<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">postmaster at ozhosting.com</A> and inform them of the time the error occurred,
and anything you might have done that may have caused the error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information about this error may be available in the server
error log.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;address&gt;Apache/2.0.46 (Red Hat) Server at ozhmx0.ozhosting.com Port
80&lt;/address&gt; &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt; 
=====================

It works fine under XSP as well it seems.  I guess my mod_mono
installation/configuration is broken somehow.  :(

At least I can potentially run XSP instead though.  :)

Any suggestions on how to further debug the problems with mod_mono?

&gt;<i> I've got to a certain point in my project and just discovered that 
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps web services in Mono aren't as developed as I'd hoped.
</I>&gt;<i> Either that or I'm missing something with my setup that is breaking 
</I>&gt;<i> them.
</I>
Your setup is likely broken, as that web service barely uses any
features in Mono, and all it uses is implemented :-)

&gt;<i> The following is a test service I wrote which just crashes
</I>&gt;<i> Apache/mod_mono  :(   The original has some of this functionality
</I>&gt;<i> wrapped in a DLL and in both cases (test and original) works fine 
</I>&gt;<i> under Windows and .NET
</I>
How does it crash it?

You could try debugging this with xsp.

Miguel
