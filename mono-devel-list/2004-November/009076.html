My bad! This message slipped my eyes. :-(


&gt;<i> Hey man, no closed curtains here, really :-)
</I>&gt;<i> The simple *existence* of the mono summit document in public
</I>&gt;<i> is just the opposite of a closed curtain!
</I>
Ok, I confess, this was a bit unfair..

&gt;<i> *** ...one just cannot write down *everything* he thinks about!
</I>&gt;<i> I have *tons* of ideas on things that could be done, and if you'll
</I>&gt;<i> implement some of them before I do, I'll just be happy for it!
</I>
Sorry to say that I've a similar problem here :-)


&gt;<i> If I &quot;waste&quot; half a day implementing an algorithm to have a post
</I>&gt;<i> dominator tree because I feel I need it, I'm not going to also
</I>&gt;<i> spend two more days to fully document all my fantasies on how that
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm could be used in conjunction with other ideas (writing
</I>&gt;<i> technical things in a clear way takes time).
</I>
Well, I'm probably a little bit different than you: If I don't make 
notes, I can not remeber anything I thought it would be cool to 
implement after a month has passed.. (And I did not expect fully blown 
technical docs - god beware!)

&gt;<i> So if you follow the list (and the project in general) there's no
</I>&gt;<i> risk of doing &quot;useless work&quot;, and even less if you also post your
</I>&gt;<i> ideas.
</I>
So it won't be seen as cluttering the list here, if I do post some of my 
own ideas for comments?


&gt;<i> What is unfortunate (IMHO) is that we're working on two forked
</I>&gt;<i> projects, and *this* can lead to a waste of time and resources.
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, IMHO.
</I>
No - I don't see it that way. It's just that I've a slightly different 
directory layout (only for my personal taste) and that I'm trying to 
figure out how good my idea of a backend was/is. I surely don't want to 
duplicate any work in other areas ..

&gt;<i> Really, I can't understand your impression of &quot;closed curtains&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> from the inside I just don't see them.
</I>&gt;<i> On the list (and/or on Monologue and on the project site) I see
</I>&gt;<i> nice descriptions of every ongoing activity.
</I>&gt;<i> What could one want more?
</I>
Ok, probably my impression came from missing some messages on this list 
and too loosely following the changelogs..

Sorry for all the noise,
  Willi
