By `ABI' i meant the automatically detected ABI by the compiler you
suggested:

&gt;<i> Also, from a security standpoint, I prefer to add the info about the
</I>&gt;<i> embedded offsets and other automatically checked data, because it
</I>&gt;<i> reduces the chances there is a human error in increasing the aot

</I>
It was probably the wrong word to use.


I think we actually agree here:

- We need to make sure that the aot files are invalidated
- It is safer to use automatic checks rather than depend on humans bumping
version numbers, for security reasons
- An the aot &lt;-&gt; runtime abi is more abstract than what the compiler can
check

Your suggestion was to embed some hash of the offsets and other ABI data
that the compiler could detect. I suggested invalidating on every build,
because the abi is more than the compiler can check. My corlib idea was
broken, it depended on an oddity of the old build system.
