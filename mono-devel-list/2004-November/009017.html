<PRE>&gt;<i> This patch moves the implementation of Interlocked functions for x86
</I>to
&gt;<i> op codes. The patch detects uniprocessor machines to allow skipping
</I>the
&gt;<i> bus lock prefix (2,5 x speed difference).
</I>&gt;<i>This is looking very nice.
</I>
Thanks.

&gt;&gt;<i> this patch; it should ignore the mp check when doing AOT, havn't had
</I>the
&gt;&gt;<i> time to fix that in this patch (simple.. Just check for AOT in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> detection)
</I>
&gt;<i>No, I don't think so. AOT code should be considered to be specific to
</I>the
&gt;<i>box it is generated on. For example, if we are on a p4, we can use cmov
</I>&gt;<i>and sse.
</I>
Fine, not my call.

&gt;<i>For `OP_ATOMIC_EXCHANGE_I4', I never understood why we can't use xchg
</I>&gt;<i>here. Is there any specific reason.
</I>
Yes, there are sevral reasons. First, xchg is always doing a buslock,
second, we can't be sure if we exchange our value with xchg because
another cpu may have changed our value before the xchg op, read
<A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/0700/Win32/">http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/0700/Win32/</A> for more info.

&gt;<i>Also, if you want something in eax or another register, you should just
</I>&gt;<i>specify that in the regalloc spec, and not us push/pop.
</I>
Again, there is a reason for the code. Our current reg allocator doesn't
support the functionality needed to fully support cmpxch ops, therefore
I thought it was best to leave that right now and get this patch in.
It's easy to fix this when the reg allocator supports it, maybe add a
bug about it. We need to support forcing dest reg (not dest as we do
today for div etc) to eax and sreg2 not in eax.

&gt;<i>I think that the inc/dec should use a common path OP_ATOMIC_ADD. In 2.0
</I>&gt;<i>there is Interlocked.Add, which adds any number. 
</I>
Not sure about that. I would add a new OP_ATOMIC_ADD for it.. But it
doesn't matter.

&gt;<i>ALso, we should add optimizations so that:
</I>
&gt;<i>Interlocked.Increment (ref foo)
</I>&gt;<i>gets turned into
</I>&gt;<i>[lock; ] inc [foo]
</I>&gt;<i>rather than an xadd type thing.
</I>
Fine, let's get the patch in first then optimize. This patch is 2,5
faster on mp machines as it is.
