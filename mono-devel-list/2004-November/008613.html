<PRE>Hi,

I just want to know if anyone is currently working on getting the 
mono-debugger working again.

I looked at this a while back and found that the code would not even 
compile because it was using knowledge of internal structures that has 
been hidden in the 1.x headers.

After I decided it is time to look into this again it seems that some 
header additions and changes happened that makes it possible to compile 
the 0.9 debugger code (maybe I just didn't notice them previously). 
Attached you can find a patch for ./wrapper/wrapper.c

The problem is that the debugger just hangs if I try to use it on a 
simple program.

So before I try to go any further, I would like to know if someone is 
already doing this so that I don't re-invent the wheel.

Thanks,

Jacques Beaurain
