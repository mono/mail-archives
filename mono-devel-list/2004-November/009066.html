In the mono site, news section, look for the summit notes...

But it talks about adding arbitrary edges, which is not what I had
in mind...

I especially liked this about dominators:

<A HREF="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cooper01simple.html">http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cooper01simple.html</A>

(its algorithm is deadly simple, it took me three hours to have
it running correctly when I thought I needed the post-dominator
tree), and this about dominance frontiers:

<A HREF="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/sreedhar94computing.html">http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/sreedhar94computing.html</A>

Anyway, what I have in mind is a bit weird, it would take too long
to explain here and I don't even know if it could really work.
When I'll have something readable about it, I'll post it (and also
blog it).

Ciao,
  Massi
