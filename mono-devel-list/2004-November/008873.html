<PRE>Hey!

It looks like this code is not used after we read the IL code. So, probably not needed.

+//					new_bb-&gt;region = bb-&gt;region;

region should == 0 in the code that you are doing, because you do not
handle exception clauses.

+//						jump-&gt;cil_code = bb-&gt;cil_code;
This is probably needed for debugging. But am not sure.

If you can reduce code duplication, it would be great. Maybe the basic
block level optimizations/transformations should be moved into a
separate file? I'd figure that a few more bb level optimizations are
going to be added (I have an old patch that I need to improve that
transforms if code into cmov and I have been wanting to write something
to find very rare bb's [ie, one that say throw new Exception ()] and
mark them as such, so that other optimizations can be smart about them).

&gt;<i> In any case, this code is debugged and seems correct, in the
</I>&gt;<i> sense that it passes a 'make rcheck' with no regressions.
</I>
Did you try make bootstrap on a clean tree? I often catch more errors
this way.
