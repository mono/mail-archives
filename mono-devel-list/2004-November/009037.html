<PRE>Hi Atsushi,

  Great work! Some comments:

  In decl.cs

+ // strip 'T:' 'M:' 'F:' 'P:' 'E:' etc.
+ // Here, MS ignores its member kind. No idea why.
+ if (cref.Length &gt; 2 &amp;&amp; cref [1] == ':')
+   signature = cref.Substring (2).Trim (wsChars);
+ else
+   signature = cref;

  I am not sure, but the reason that I see is that the only place
where discrepancy can be when there's a property name that clashes
with a data-type. However, it will also mean that there's an inner
class/enum/struct/blah with the same name as property which is not
allowed.

  So, it is safe to assume that during searching, you can live without &quot;F:&quot; etc.

  I haven't tested the code, check with something like following:

  public void SomeMethod(string /** &lt;summary&gt;Interesting&lt;/summary&gt; */
param1) {... }

  or

  public /// &lt;remarks&gt;something&lt;/remarks&gt;
        void /// &lt;summary&gt;Very very interesting &lt;/summary&gt;
     ThisIsInteresting() { ...}

&lt;snip from=&quot;cs-parser.jay&quot;&gt;
:<i> opt_attributes
</I>  opt_modifiers
  type namespace_or_type_name
+  {
+   tmpComment = Lexer.consume_doc_comment ();
+   Lexer.doc_state = XmlCommentState.NG;
+ }
&lt;/snip&gt;

  I couldn't locate it as a test-case. From what it seems to me
currently, it may pickup the comments... but not quite sure.

  IMO, if it picks up these comments, move the collection of the
comments to &quot;opt_attributes&quot; or ... well, I also faced this issue.
Right now, I don't have the code with me... don't recall how I handled
it. I can get back on this if required.

  The code otherwise looks pretty ok. I also learnt a few things from
your code that I may directly borrow for my doc-engine. :-)


Cheers,
Gaurav
