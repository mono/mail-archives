Thats really, really old.

&gt;<i> Current stable version of MONO is 1.0.4. Is that &quot;1.0.4&quot; also a

&gt;<i> (compilation and optimization technique..) been updated a lot since
</I>&gt;<i> 0.25 and 0.26?
</I>Yes, it has changed alot
&gt;<i> I'm asking this question because i remember that Ximian was planning

</I>&gt;<i> that new JIT works .
</I>I forget which version the new jit is in. The new jit is absolutely in
1.0.x
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How about MINT? The size of interp.c in both versions(0.25 and 1.0.4)
</I>&gt;<i> is different. Is MINT still being evolved?
</I>Yes, it is

I suggest you upgrade, there is no reason to stay on .25.
