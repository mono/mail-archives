Described in the summit notes: the code is not in cvs yet.

</I>
Only in degenerate cases (many threads each many call frames into the stack,
where many is in the thousands). Using counters would be a nightmare to 
maintain.

A lot less and after the hot methods are recompiled it could be
shut down or the sampling frequency could be reduced.

Sampling the call stack and not just the IP address should provide
most of the interesting info.

Note that we are interested in portable solutions: using arch-specific
stuff is of course welcome, but the solution should be implementable in 
other architectures, too.

&gt;<i> Code that runs endlessly in a loop probably isn't a good candidate for 
</I>&gt;<i> runtime replacement at all. Probably 'transfer-points' - icalls p/i 
</I>
Eh, yeah, if we could remove issues by just saying they don't exist:-)

&gt;<i> calls are good candidates - could be introduced that have a known 
</I>&gt;<i> stack/register state, but well..
</I>
Sure, but it's a lot of complex work.

&gt;<i> Ok, point taken. (Although if you'd move inssel into the backend and let 
</I>&gt;<i> the inssel generate the final code into the target buffer, things should 
</I>&gt;<i> be faster. However, it's questionable how much.)
</I>
That would prevent a cheap but effective peephole pass, so your proposal
would actually slow down mono.

&gt;<i> I'm quite surprised no-one commented on my C++ proposal! So does that 
</I>&gt;<i> mean if I send patches that use C++, you'll accept them?
</I>
I didn't see any reference to C++ in your mail: you talked about objects,
but we're fairly good at doing objects in C, too (see the linux kernel, 
Gtk+, etc:-)
Anyway, no C++ code in the runtime.
Thanks.
