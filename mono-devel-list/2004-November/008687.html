<PRE>I mailed about the debugger in the last week as well (and quite some 
time ago). I wanted to find out what the status of the development was 
and got no answer so far.

Since then  I uninstalled everything Mono from my system and retrieved 
the following modules from CVS,  compiled and installed them:

mcs
mono
monodoc
gtksharp
gtksourceview-sharp
debugger

Note that you'll need an existing Mono runtime (and maybe some other 
dependencies) on your system to compile these. I compiled them using 
tarballs from the download page as needed.

To use the debugger you need to obtain libedit from somewhere (I use 
Gentoo so I just ran emerge libread) and make sure the include files can 
be reached from the compile. I inspected the output failures from the 
compile and had to obtain the headers from the version I had (because 
the emerge did not install them).

I had another stumbling block towards getting debugging support, my 
glibc did not suport nptl (Native POSIX Threads Library). You can check 
for that by running the following (example output included):

/lib/libc.so.6

&lt;<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/bugs.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/bugs.html</A>&gt;.

To get debugger support in MonoDevelop I edited the configure script 
after running ./autogen.sh and chaged the following line:

enable_debugger=no

to read:

enable_debugger=yes

Now I think that there may be a reason that it is still disabled here, 
it hung once while I was testing it on a small program. It was only on 
program exit so it is still very usable and mdb seems  to work fine from 
the command line.

Hope this gets you going.

Cheers,

Jacques Beaurain
