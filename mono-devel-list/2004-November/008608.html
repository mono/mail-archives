Over the years I have come to think of the compiler as being a part of .NET
-- one does not have .NET without a C# compiler :-) I have even come to
think of Java in this way, even though it is patently untrue.

This answers my question :-) Thanks. The reason I wondered is because a
number of people have asked about the use of UTF-8, and while the use of
/codepage has been suggested many times, nobody has once suggested placing
the byte marks at the start of the file, which would solve the problem
permanently without needing new flags to compile. Of course, that also
requires a code editor that recognizes the byte marks, but let's face it:
we are living in the 21st century now. :-)

Thanks,

Jonathan Gilbert
