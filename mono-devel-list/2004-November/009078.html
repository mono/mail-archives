Ok - so I'll go ahead and post some of my ideas about the profile thing 
and hope that it will at least trigger some tiny little comments..

@workingImplementation:  I'm not as quick in writing C code as in coming

ideas :-) (Actually I'm coming from a Delphi background - so C is not my 
mother tongue *g*)
