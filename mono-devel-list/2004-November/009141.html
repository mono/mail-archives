As soon as it's ready.

A lot, note you'll need atomic counters to be thread safe etc.

Well, there are two ways to deal with branches here:
*) sampling the ip will find that the basic blocks executed will have samples
(or many more samples), while the not taken branch will end up in basic blocks
that don't have or have few hits.
*) using the performance counters in modern processors may provide the info
directly

As for access patterns, the second solution may help as well. I agree
for some things some embedded code may need to be emitted: it's just that 
in general I think we should avoid it. BTW, there is people who did already
that sort of optimization with mono (optimizing the code based on the
access patterns to arrays): I don't know if the paper has been already 
published, though.

&gt;<i> I meant the initial codegen would be faster. Later on the emitted code 
</I>
The peephole and memcpy pass is very fast, there is no point in avoiding it.

&gt;<i> AFAIK the peephole optimizer works on a small set of opcodes. So adding 
</I>&gt;<i> a peephole pass would still be possible.. But of course you end up 
</I>&gt;<i> having a small memory buffer for it and touching each opcode twice again..
</I>
Yes, and thus make the code unreadable and unmaintainable which we don't 
want to do.
 
&gt;<i> course I wasn't talking about bells and whistles C++, just the basic 
</I>&gt;<i> set: objects and possibly exceptions. And of course none of all this in 
</I>
The 'basic set' as you call it is:
$ ls -s /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.5.0.7 
728 /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.5.0.7

That's in kilobytes.
It also forces mono to depend on the C++ ABI, so it breaks each time
the C++ ABI changes. So it's a lot of baggage for very little benefit.

&gt;<i> &gt;Anyway, no C++ code in the runtime.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Thanks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Doesn't like that, but'll stick to it.
</I>
Note: if you prefer writing the code in C++ for your thesis it's fine,
it's just that we can't add it to the main tree.
