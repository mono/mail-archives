Thanks, now I got only two copies, it is an improvement at least, though
you could certainly do better and just don't mail me multiple copies
of the same mail.

You apparently still don't understand, since this is a completely 
unrelated issue and it is already checked for. The corlib version is
about the corlib &lt;-&gt; runtime ABI. We are talking instead about the
runtime &lt;-&gt; aot images ABI. They are two different things: take the time
to understand the issue because you're mixing them up and just wasting 
our time.

&gt;<i> Not to mention, executing an untrusted .so aot file is a security hole

Dude, that's not the issue: the issue is that with your proposal of
using the corlib guid, there is no relation to the runtime &lt;-&gt; aot
ABI. Saying abvious things about unrelated issues is just a waste of time.

Good, so it looks like you at least read the part of my email where 
I said that.

Wrong. Changing the fields order and offsets _will_ change the 
aot &lt;-&gt; runtime ABI. Sigh.
