<PRE>Hello,

   For technical details (documented in our SVN migration page) we had
to redo our migration from CVS to SVN.  No changes were lost, but people
will have to recheckout their trees, the new information is available:

	<A HREF="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/svn-migration.html">http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/svn-migration.html</A>

   Thanks to everyone who helped track this down, and the Subversion
developers to which assisted us the whole time.  

   There were no problems with Subversion, just with the way we did the
import ourselves.  We will document this case for other users which in
the future want to move to Subversion to help them avoid the mistakes I
made.

   In addition to this some Subversion developers have written a script
that will help us clean up our tree (see document above) in the future.

Thanks again,
Miguel.

</PRE>
