<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Libgdiplus 1.0.2 as downloaded from the mono site does
</I>&gt;<i> NOT have an autogen.sh script.  However the README for
</I>&gt;<i> libgdiplus just had to do a ./configure
</I>&gt;<i> --prefix=YOURPREFIX.  I used /usr/bin for the prefix. 
</I>
Okay. It looks like you're using the tarballs instead of checking out
from cvs.

Have you any other installs of libgdiplus anywhere on your machine?
Include in those any rpm versions and bits downloaded from the internet.
If you have, get rid of them. Check /usr/local/lib incase there is a
libgdiplus in there.

By the way it sounds, something is getting really confused on your
system.

Once you've removed all of the libgdi stuff, grab a copy of libgdiplus
from cvs and use that instead. I would also recommend doing that for
mono, mcs and gtk-sharp rather than using the tarballs.

TTFN

Paul
