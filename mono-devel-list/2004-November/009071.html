Well, I already read the summit notes multiple times - it just talks 
about Paolo doing new trampolines and Zoltan doing a new object file 
format (any specification/idea available?).

The problem is: If I go ahead and do something in that area and propose 
a patch on the list, it won't be included because the JIT team has come 
up with a completely distinct solution to the problem. :-((

Everything happens behind closed curtains - you are the only one who 
actually gives feedback and enjoys a little conversation (with 'nuts' 
like me) from time to time. Thanks a lot for that!

Ok, so it won't be of any help if I would go ahead implement some algo 
based on the papers above, I guess. Anyway, I'm looking forward to your 
post about the idea :-)

Thanks again,
