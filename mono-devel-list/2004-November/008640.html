<PRE>Mono crew:

I'm looking for a speaker for our upcoming users conference.  The 
conference will be held in April of '05 in Santa Clara and we are 
planning on having a great .NET/Mono track.  I am looking for someone 
who can present on the following:

1.  Using Connector/Net from Mono

This session would focus more on the mono-specific issues of using 
Connector/net.  Current bugs in Mono, workarounds necessary should be 
covered.  Also, a review of the tools currently available to Mono 
developers would be good.  Any performance numbers available would also 
be welcome.  Essentially, any information that a developer who is 
thinking of using Mono to develop MySQL applications would want should 
be covered.

Any takers?

Thanks
Reggie
