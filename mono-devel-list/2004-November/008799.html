<PRE>Hi,

I prefer using apr as much as possible. The only part I planned to be non
portable is the code that should obtain the path for mono from the registry.

I apr_ized the fork part a couple of months ago, but I have to adapt it to
current release. By now I didn't want to mess with that again until I have
mod_mono talking properly to mod-mono-server.

Of course having a way to build mono under Cygwin in a simple way would be
great so development with latest source would be simple under windows too.
Keep up the good work :)

PS. Perhaps later today I'll have something fairly complete.
