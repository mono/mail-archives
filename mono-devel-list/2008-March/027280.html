<PRE>Hi everyone,

I'm interested in applying for GSOC to work on Mono.Media and I was just
wondering if I could get a few more details about the project.  Has any work
been completed on it?  How comprehensive in terms of codec support are you
looking for?

This past summer I developed
ffmpeg-sharp&lt;<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/ffmpeg-sharp/">http://code.google.com/p/ffmpeg-sharp/</A>&gt;to aid in decoding
audio for a (yet to be released) media player I've been
working on for the past year, so I have some [released] background on audio
workings.  I've also done work with both OpenAL and DirectSound for my media
player (I can provide code samples of the work I've done).

The way I would envision the framework is a base library that supports both
codec and backend plugins; eg. a backend plugin for DirectSound, OpenAL,
ALSA, etc.. and frontend plugins for codec support such as ffmpeg.

I see for audio playback, simple single-threaded methods for audio playback
that either take a stream or file and play it back as well as more
complicated multi-threaded workings for continuous or dynamic playback.
I've done sone work on the gapless side using OpenAL.Net for my player.

I was just curious if I could get a little input on my ideas and whatnot
before I go ahead and write up my application.

Thank you in advance,
Justin Cherniak
