<PRE>Sorry for the double post, but I didn't see my message on the listserv, so I
wanted to resend it:

Hi everyone,

I'm interested in applying for GSOC to work on Mono.Media and I was just
wondering if I could get a few more details about the project.  Has any work
been completed on it?  How comprehensive in terms of codec support are you
looking for?

This past summer I developed
ffmpeg-sharp&lt;<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/ffmpeg-sharp/">http://code.google.com/p/ffmpeg-sharp/</A>&gt;to aid in decoding
and encoding audio for a (yet to be released) media
player I've been working on for the past year, so I have some background on
audio playback.  I've also done work with both OpenAL and DirectSound for my
media player (I can provide code samples of the work I've done).

The way I would envision the framework is a base library that supports both
codec and backend plugins; eg. a backend plugin for DirectSound, OpenAL,
ALSA, etc.. and frontend plugins for codec support such as ffmpeg.

I see two methods for audio playback, simple single-threaded methods that
take either a stream or file and play it back as well as more complicated
multi-threaded methods for continuous or dynamic playback.  I've done some
work with gapless playback using OpenAL and Directsound for my player.

I was just curious if I could get a little input on my ideas and whatnot
before I go ahead and write up my application.

Thank you in advance,
Justin Cherniak
