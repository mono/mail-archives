There are two issues.
First that is related to a different change that the rest of the patch:
it's better to do things incrementally instead of conflating multiple
things into the same changeset.
Second, GetElementSize () is not the right interface for use inside
Buffer. Buffer only applies for a subset of the arrays (basic types and
maybe valuetypes of basic types only, I didn't check all the allowed
cases). So you'd need at least another icall that says if the Copy
operations are allowed on the array. It's better to have a single icall
that does it all, returning 0 for the cases where the copy is not
allowed. In that case the name GetElementSize would be wrong.
