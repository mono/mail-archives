Yes. The packages by my distro also seems to work. I personally has not been 
able, admittedly giving it only a few hours time, to actually compile from 
scratch a working monodevelop &quot;instance&quot;. Unfortunately - last I looked - 
mdtools was not part of the distro packages. (Which are based on quite old 
versions of monodevelop).

&gt;<i> This is fairly off-topic, though, as the 
</I>&gt;<i> prj2make functionality is part of mdtool, a command line utility
</I>&gt;<i> distributed with MonoDevelop, which I assume is not what has been
</I>&gt;<i> crashing on you.
</I>
In honesty I have not tried mdtool, as I have not been able to make my 
homecompiled monodevelop's run. And, also, xbuild works for our purposes.

Obviously, if mdtool is independent of the GUI part of monodevelop to run, and 
it is trivial to compile this part, prj2make should be safe to retire.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Still looking for a stable release of monodevelop, btw.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps you will have more luck with the upcoming 1.0 release.  Have
</I>&gt;<i> you tried the release candidates?
</I>
No. It was my impression in start december 2007, that a stable release of 
monodevelop was forthcoming in mid january. I regret that I have not had the 
time to look at rc releases - I was planning to evaluate the stable release 
of mono develop (giving it the time to actually compile it) against using 
eclipse for C# development.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  This is not to diss monodevelop - I am simply reporting my personal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  experience.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I hope you've also been reporting these experiences to bugzilla or the
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop mailing list so that they can be resolved.
</I>
No I haven't. I have read similar &quot;stories&quot; on this list, and I was under the 
impression that part of the work of the stable version of monodevelop was to 
make it easer to create a working self-compiled version of monodevelop.

Of course, I may be wrong.

Regards

Mads
