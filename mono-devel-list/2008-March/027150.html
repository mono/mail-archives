At first I thought this might be the problem too, but in the 1.1.17
changelog I found the following:

---

mod_mono

Added support for X.509 client certificates. It's now possible to use
System.Web.HttpClientCertificate with Apache. Certificate validation
can be done by Apache, Mono or both (default). [Hubert Fongarnand,
Sebastien Pouliot]

---

which seems to indicate that support does exist..?

I considered looking through the mod_mono code earlier, but the fact
that the CERT_FLAGS variable was not even set made me think it was
actually Apache that wasn't sending the appropriate info to mod_mono
rather than mod_mono not supporting the interpretation of those
variables.  Perhaps mod_mono isn't actually requesting that info from
Apache?

As is probably obvious, I have no idea what I'm talking about.  Any
suggestions on where to start would be most welcome, heh.
