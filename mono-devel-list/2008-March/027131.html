Winforms is short of Windows Forms, which is the GUI toolkit of .NET
(so yeah, if you have buttons you're probably using it).

I'm not sure, but I think your best bet is to run the Mono Migration
Analyzer (we called it MoMA) on your application from Windows to see
if there are any potential problems with the pieces of Mono you would
be using:
