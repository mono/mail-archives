Thanks Onur,
I'm not sure what are the basic components needed to run the application but 
from my sources, the application I rebuild in MonoDevelop was created with 
C#2.0 and VS2005. I'm not sure what Winform is and if it's used but the 
application does have buttons (if that's what the winform does). As for ASP 
that's not used as far as I can tell.
Could I assume that a comparison chart of .NET and Mono is pointless because 
of the various components? What would be the best comparison method to 
compare the two? Or what would be the determining how usable a particular 
version of mono is? Is it the version of C# supported?  My all means correct 
me if I'm wrong or off-track because I'm not sure how Mono fits together. 

Much thanks.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  I'm new to Mono and actually never heard of it until two weeks ago when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I was asked to look into it. I manage to get an existing .NET application
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (developed under VS2005) build and ran on my debian box. Their were a few
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; issue but related to filenames (case sensitivity and/or path processing),
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but I got it to run despite never using the software (Mono or .NET).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  What I don't know is to what extent .NET differs from Mono. Is their a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  comparison chart of what's supported in Mono when comared to .NET?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Is their any documentation indicating the difference between the?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  How do I determine what are the basic tools I need to run a build
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; application? ldd does not work on the executables so how so I know which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; libraries are absolutely required? Does ldd on mono tell the whole story?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Thank you.
