<PRE>Hi,

I don't know the exact status of COM support so if you need this information 
you should wait for Jonathan Chambers.

You should be aware however that COM is a Windows specific technology so if 
you want to use it I recommend you to use Microsoft .NET Framework that 
should be compatible with Mono as has more Windows specific characteristics 
than Mono.

Mono is intended to be platform independent so we have less focus on 
supporting Windows specific features altough more and more such technologies 
are supported by Mono as well.

Also note that as far as I know WebClient, WebRequest, WebResponse are 
supported by Mono only a few methods are not implemented.

Subject: [Mono-dev] Mono COM support question


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hello dear developers,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am Sebi and I'm currently developing an application which aims to do
</I>&gt;<i> massive encoding of queued movies
</I>&gt;<i> and of course, as open source supporter, I decided to use Mono as the
</I>&gt;<i> development environment for this application in my
</I>&gt;<i> company.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am currently using Mono 1.2.6-1 as I had no time to update it to a
</I>&gt;<i> later version yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wrote approximately 14500 lines of code in almost 2.5 months since I
</I>&gt;<i> started this project and I must tell you that I'm really
</I>&gt;<i> pleased with your product. I encountered some problems but successfully
</I>&gt;<i> developed some features from scratch if they were
</I>&gt;<i> not implemented yet natively by Mono or found answers all over the
</I>&gt;<i> internet about how to solve my problems (such of not
</I>&gt;<i> implemented WebClient, WebRequest, WebResponse, etc... anyway using
</I>&gt;<i> sockets I managed to successfully create classes that
</I>&gt;<i> work like a charm)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is that now I need to use COM communication. I will have to
</I>&gt;<i> use Flix Engine from On2 and as I discovered reading
</I>&gt;<i> their documentation / how-tos, I sorta' need this. (functions like
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Type.GetTypeFromProgID(&quot;xyz&quot;)&quot; for example are not
</I>&gt;<i> yet implemented)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have no experience at all with COM communication or such, so please
</I>&gt;<i> forgive me if this will make some of you laugh or something :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can I know when COM support will be added? Or can anyone help me a bit
</I>&gt;<i> solving this communication? There's this SDK from
</I>&gt;<i> On2 that I have to use. There is a version for linux of their SDK, but
</I>&gt;<i> any suggestions about how to solve this the right way will be
</I>&gt;<i> appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for all your support and Go MONO!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With kind regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Sebi
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
