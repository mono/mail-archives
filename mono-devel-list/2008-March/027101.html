Whether this will ever be implemented on Linux is best answered by
Jonathan Chambers.

Regardless, it is highly unlikely that the On2 Flix engine will work via
COM on Linux, so if you need Linux support it won't happen.  You would
instead need to, at minimum, use Win32 Mono hosted on Wine instead of
Linux Mono, in addition to getting ProgID support within Mono's Win32
COM support.

</I>
If you intend to run on Linux, I would suggest looking at their Linux
SDK, which in all likelihood is _not_ based on COM.
