<PRE>Hi,

Can someone knowledgeable please clarify whether what I want to do is
acceptable under Mono's license - I want to take HttpWebRequest class
and change it for my custom need of being able to provide custom DNS
server for resolves (this might involve changing actually Dns.Resolve
function) - I am fully aware that this is not something Mono needs
because you probably don't want these &quot;extensions&quot; of .NET's
functionality, however I am concerned whether I am right thinking that
LGPL 2 license under which (as I understand) class library is licensed
will allow me to take these couple of source files, add extra
functionality that I need and link them with my commercial application
without having to make whole application open sourced - if I understand
LGPL correctly I will need to make open source actual changes that I
make to the library itself, which is fine by me.

Am I right or wrong?

Initially I looked at Rotor shared source but their license is too
restrictive so I don't want to get involved with it.

regards,

Alex
