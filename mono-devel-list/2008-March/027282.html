<PRE>Hi all,

(Resending, as the first mail apparently didn't reach the list)

I've wanted to migrate from gecko to webkit for some time in my app, but 
I've not been able to find WebKit/Gtk bindings (there are some cocoa 
ones, but apparently that's only for OSX users). Therefore I've decided 
to create my own.

These are being written by hand because the glib part of WebKit/Gtk is 
written in some sbuset of C++ which gapi2 doesn't grok, so bad luck.

You can find a page about these bindings at 
<A HREF="http://cmartin.tk/webkitgtk-sharp.html">http://cmartin.tk/webkitgtk-sharp.html</A> where you can download a tarball 
with the current status (more or less).

There is also a gitweb server running at <A HREF="http://git.cmartin.tk">http://git.cmartin.tk</A> and you 
can see the address to clone the tree in the webpage mentioned above, 
but please be kind as it is an old server with _very_ limited bandwidth. 
The project is hosted there until I find somewhere better to put it if 
there is any interest in them.

What works:
- You can embed a WebKit.WebView in your Gtk# application as a 
Gtk.Widget and have it open a web page (as shown by the demo application).
- Some WebSettings work, but you probably shouldn't rely on that.

What doesn't work:
- Basically anything else. Some features are partly implemented but most 
won't work.

If there is interest in these bindings I'll open a project at 
sourceforge or alioth or something so my poor server gets a rest.

Regards,
  cmn
