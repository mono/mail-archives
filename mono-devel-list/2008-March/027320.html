<PRE>Hey

&gt;<i> I'm interested in applying for GSOC to work on Mono.Media and I was
</I>&gt;<i> just wondering if I could get a few more details about the project.
</I>&gt;<i> Has any work been completed on it?  How comprehensive in terms of
</I>&gt;<i> codec support are you looking for?
</I>
No work has been done in this area, so part of the challenge is in
coming up with a definition of what exactly this should do.

Input is welcomed.

Notice that this is not a full-blown binding to GStreamer, but it will
likely use gstreamer underneath it.   I suggest to draw inspiration from
Java Media, as it has probably all the major concepts covered.

&gt;<i> This past summer I developed ffmpeg-sharp to aid in decoding and
</I>&gt;<i> encoding audio for a (yet to be released) media player I've been
</I>&gt;<i> working on for the past year, so I have some background on audio
</I>&gt;<i> playback.  I've also done work with both OpenAL and DirectSound for my
</I>&gt;<i> media player (I can provide code samples of the work I've done).
</I>
This sound interesting.

Am particularly interested in being able to control MIDI and play back
MIDI audio at a minimum.

&gt;<i> The way I would envision the framework is a base library that supports
</I>&gt;<i> both codec and backend plugins; eg. a backend plugin for DirectSound,
</I>&gt;<i> OpenAL, ALSA, etc.. and frontend plugins for codec support such as
</I>&gt;<i> ffmpeg.
</I>
I am fine with this.

&gt;<i> I see two methods for audio playback, simple single-threaded methods
</I>&gt;<i> that take either a stream or file and play it back as well as more
</I>&gt;<i> complicated multi-threaded methods for continuous or dynamic playback.
</I>&gt;<i> I've done some work with gapless playback using OpenAL and Directsound
</I>&gt;<i> for my player.
</I>

&gt;<i> I was just curious if I could get a little input on my ideas and
</I>&gt;<i> whatnot before I go ahead and write up my application.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you in advance,
</I>&gt;<i> Justin Cherniak
