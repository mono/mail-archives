Seems like a gratuitous change to me.  

We are already exposing Cairo.Graphics in the 2.7.1 release of Gtk#.
It's an unstable release, so I can change the symbol still, but the
change as posted would break 2.7.1 on newer mono releases.

If this change is going to be made, at the very least I would suggest
adding something like:

[Obsolete (&quot;Replaced by Cairo.Context&quot;)]
public class Graphics : Context {}

That would at least give source compat, if not runtime compat. But I
don't personally think it's worth changing just to be consistent with
other language bindings.
