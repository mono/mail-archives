<PRE>Hi all,

I'm trying to port a .NET application programmed with Visual Studio to
MONO. The main problem I have found is that this application was created
for Compaq Framework and it does run on a Windows Platform but just
because of the MIL's retargetable switch that Microsoft uses to reference
libraries that are not the &quot;same&quot; but are good enough to be used in case
the framework can't find exactly what it's looking for.

My problems is that it seems that MONO doesn't recognize this 'switch',
actually it seems to crash with a simple Windows Forms application created
for compaq framework. My questions are: am I right, MONO doesn't recognize
this switch, if I am is there any kind of patch or does anyone think that
there will be someday in the future?

Thanks a lot,

Alberto.
