<PRE>&gt;<i> +                                       //FIXME: does usesystemdefault
</I>&gt;<i> or presence of address take precedence?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why not testing this now that you're on the case and make it work like
</I>&gt;<i> it does in MS?
</I>
I've got onto Windows and done some testing on .NET 1.1, and it
appears the values are treated as follows:

1. First the value of &quot;proxyaddress&quot; is used. If it is not empty and
parses correctly as a URI, this address is used.
2. If the address was not already assigned and &quot;usesystemdefault&quot; is
true (blank == false), then address is loaded from the environment.
3. If this is empty, or parsing it fails, the address is left blank.

&gt;<i> -                                       } catch (Exception) {
</I>&gt;<i> +                                       } catch (UriFormatException) {
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do not change this. There might be other exceptions thrown.
</I>
Note the silent fallthrough on bad URI formats on .NET. I therefore
think that that catching Exception is overzealous, as if it does occur
that will be due to a bug.

Is it okay to commit now? I don't have a direct internet connection
here, so if someone could double-check that it definately works
without a proxy that would be nice.
