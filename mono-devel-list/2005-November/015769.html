Figuring out when the files change is not a problem, but...

Besides restarting a mod-mono-server process, as I said, there's no way 
to restart individual applications.  This has to do with complicated 
AppDomain unloading issues.

&gt;<i> (esp not clearing their cache.  That can be a big performance hit if it

I don't think that's possible, not for caching in general.  Cached 
objects in memory can't stick around if the whole application is being 
restarted.

Well this is possible, as we know, except not automatic.

Pending the ability for applications to be unloaded/restarted, we could 
add something that automatically restarts a mod-mono-server when 
particular files are updated.  (But note that this involves a policy 
decision too, because you wouldn't necessarily want someone to be able 
to restart everyone's applications just by recompiling.)

&gt;<i>     ii. We would probably need two tiers of Mono control panel. (Call
</I>&gt;<i> them GlobalMonoCtl MonoCtl)
</I>
Okay, I'll think about how to do something like that.
