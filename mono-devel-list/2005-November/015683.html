<PRE>I tried to add a few internal calls to expose certain features to classes.
With older mono version, i did it by adding them at icall.c

With same approach in mono1.1.9, I got runtime error &quot;myapp.dll contains
native code and mono can't run it.&quot;

1)
Is it because mono doesn't allow internal calls through library dll other
than mscorlib.dll?

2) Another problem is that when install mono1.1.9, mcs directory wasn't
compiled successfully. It looks for mcs.exe from mcs/class/lib/basic/ etc. I
don't know why i face this problem.

3)
Long time back, Ximian used to release mcs source including full class
libraries. But, not i can't find those type of package. No other way to get
source of class libraries other than that included in mono?

4) is there any tool to check the list of objects archived into certain dll?
for example, in unix, we can use nm command to list symbols (or names of
objects) archived into lib**.a.
