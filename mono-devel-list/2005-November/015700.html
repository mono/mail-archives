The debugger is, has been, and will likely continue to be a
work-in-progress.  It is not currently usable by mere mortals.

Which leaves *.WriteLine and log files as your &quot;debugging&quot; mechanism --
Console.WriteLine() (not suitable for mod_mono), Console.Error.WriteLine
(sent to Apache's error_log), System.Diagnostics.Trace.WriteLine()...

For System.Diagnostics.Trace, you'll probably want to set the
(XPath) /configuration/system.diagnostics/assert/@logfilename attribute
in your .config file (app-name.exe.config or web.config), e.g.:

	&lt;configuration&gt;
	  &lt;system.diagnostics&gt;
	    &lt;assert logfilename=&quot;your-log-file.txt&quot; /&gt;
	  &lt;/system.diagnostics&gt;
	&lt;/configuration&gt;

You can also add additional TraceListeners to send output to additional
files if necessary.  You might find this interesting:

	<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-list/2002-December/010504.html">http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-list/2002-December/010504.html</A>

If using System.Diagnostics.Trace, don't forget to compile your code
with the TRACE symbol defined, e.g. with ``#define TRACE''.

&gt;<i> 2) Do I submit patches in standard format? Is it preferred to diff
</I>&gt;<i> against svn head or latest release? (I'll look on the site for something
</I>&gt;<i> on submitting patches)
</I>
Diffs need to be in unified-diff format (e.g. `diff -upN`).  The default
`svn diff` output is in unified-diff format, and is thus acceptable.  

Diffing against svn-head is easiest for us to deal with, as the code may
have changed (possibly fixing your bug) since the last release.

&gt;<i> 3) Tools for development reopened...
</I>
What, no (g) -- vim/emacs and a command line?  Works great remotely when
X11 forwarding is off.

&gt;<i>     c. MonoDevelop (tried it about a year ago.. Has it gotten
</I>&gt;<i> significantly better?)
</I>
Define &quot;significantly&quot;.  I've heard the more recent versions are more
stable, but I don't use it.

&gt;<i> Is there anything that will allow a preview window for
</I>&gt;<i> .xml/.html/xhtml/.aspx based pages. (Don't need WYSIWYG editor)
</I>&gt;<i> Must work in Linux
</I>&gt;<i> Built-in debugger
</I>&gt;<i> FTP/SFTP/SVN/CSV support
</I>&gt;<i> Project explorer and quick navigation
</I>&gt;<i> Autocompletion?
</I>&gt;<i> Fast and not using Java?
</I>&gt;<i> Open source?
</I>
Nothing has all of those features, because one of them doesn't currently
exist -- a &quot;Built-in debugger.&quot;  You've already mentioned several
programs which will handle some of the items on that list, MonoDevelop
in particular, and I don't know of any unmentioned programs that would
work.
