Ah, what I meant was you can control access to the &quot;mono/?restart=...&quot; 
URLs that when accessed actually do the restarting, so you can control 
which links are functional in that way.

Anything more is probably going to be based on a local policy decision. 
  We could add a tool of some sort to make this all easier, but since I 
don't know what kind of tool would be useful for sysadmins, I wouldn't 
know what to make.

The whole process is restarted, so anything kept in memory is cleared.

(And, I don't know the answers to your other questions.)
