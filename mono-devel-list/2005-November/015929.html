<PRE>Hi,

In order to retrieve all the messages processed by an application I think I 
can use Application.AddMessageFilter. Ok, but what about injecting them 
later on?

Well, in windows I could use TranslateMessage/DispatchMessage to reinject 
the &quot;recorded&quot; messages (at least in win32 apps), (BTW fixing msg.Hwnd with 
the correct value if you try to &quot;play&quot; after relaunching the application), 
but with mono (on Linux) this is not possible. Is there a way to do that?

With something like that it would be possible to write a multi-platform 
&quot;test recorder&quot; application for Mono, something to create and run &quot;automated 
user tests&quot; on both Windows and Linux (and maybe other platforms too...). I 
don't know such a tool (AFAIK WinRunner, Rational's TestRobot, AutomatedQA's 
TestComplete, and the like, only run on Windows) and maybe it would be quite 
interesting... (at least until we have an Automation namespace like Avalon).

Thanks.
