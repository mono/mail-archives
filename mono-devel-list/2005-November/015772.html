Yeah.. I realized this, and was a drastic over simplification, but
didn't want to write a book...

Is there any current way to put each site on it's own process? ( I think
this might be key to a temp solution if it's _easy_)

&gt;<i> I don't think that's possible, not for caching in general.  Cached

No no.. I was talking about some layer of separation between sites and
assuming each site was somehow on it's own process.

Site A is restarting (and all cached object go to garbage/recovered)
Site B is using tons of caching.. (Any way to protect all it's cached
objects from A's restart)

In general I think if there is a way to run each site on it's own
process, keep the performance impact of a restart to a minimum between
sites and a minor control panel addition.. (We could maybe* start to
look at mass virtual mono hosting)

Which files do the heavy lifting for loading/unloading of AppDomain(s). 
I'm going to guess this isn't documented so I'm curious to look at the
source and how loading/unloading is currently done.  Does MS document
how they do it anywhere and do we currently follow suite currently?

Thanks for the ideas

C.
