Peter pointed me to this:

<A HREF="http://www.cairographics.org/manual/language-bindings.html">http://www.cairographics.org/manual/language-bindings.html</A>

Which clearly supports the change.

As far as confusion with Obsolete API, we need to add some support to
monodoc for stuffing obsolete API onto a special page or at least
highlighting summaries for obsolete members/types. 

I guess we just need an official statement from Miguel as to whether the
Mono.Cairo API was ever declared stable.  It has shipped with stable
releases already, but I don't know if that alone carries an expectation
of stability.

Since the Gtk# exposure of Cairo.Graphics is so new and unstable, we
could probably get around the issue by simultaneously releasing a new
Gtk# with the next mono release.

We also need to address the issue of Mono.Cairo availability on win32
with the MS runtime.  We need to be able to build/ship Mono.Cairo
without mono on win32 for Gtk#.
