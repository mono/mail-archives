The file handling code should be the same between those two releases, as
far as I can remember.

The share data is stored in a file in ~/.wapi.  If it finds a record for
the file you are trying to open, it tries to check /proc for mono
processes that have that file open.  Look in
mono/io-layer/handles.c:_wapi_handle_check_share to see what it's doing,
and you might be able to watch it in gdb to see why it's failing.
