<PRE>I think OSX support for GTK just went into cvs recently.

Subject: [Mono-dev] SWF, gtk#, OSX, Linux, Win32, GUI's thougths?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would just like to get some thoughts and clarifications about a 
</I>&gt;<i> few things.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) It says SWF at end of month.. and then months of testing.. when 
</I>&gt;<i> will it likely debut in the
</I>&gt;<i> 	standard distribution (dowload page) , and not be a cvs only? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) It is mentioned how SWF will work on Win32, OSX and linux, is it 
</I>&gt;<i> possible that the release that
</I>&gt;<i> 	has SWF will &quot;for sure&quot; have SWF working on all three 
</I>&gt;<i> Win32/Linux/OSX, with OSX not needing X11
</I>&gt;<i> 	support .. or may it be the case that it could come out, at fisrt, 
</I>&gt;<i> not supporting OSX?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) No IP flames intended here (just assume there might be an issue) 
</I>&gt;<i> ... 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Having been around Mono now for 2+ years, I have seen much written
</I>&gt;<i> 	about the licensing and IP issues. Let just assume for this 
</I>&gt;<i> question that there is a possibly a MS
</I>&gt;<i> 	IP &quot;issue&quot; that could come along for SWF in the future. I would 
</I>&gt;<i> really rather use GTK# 
</I>&gt;<i> 	for win32/linux/OSX x-platform dev. (call it personal choice) but 
</I>&gt;<i> as we know gtk# for 
</I>&gt;<i> 	native OSX (no X11 deps.) is no where is sight. So this (above) 
</I>&gt;<i> got me thinking -
</I>&gt;<i> 	We know a certain portion of people on/in the Mono project are MS 
</I>&gt;<i> people (which is great,
</I>&gt;<i> 	Mono needs that), and the MS people are of course going to want 
</I>&gt;<i> SWF for their GUI a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> 	the time? But is it not true that many others would want gtk#? and 
</I>&gt;<i> in fact from what I see 
</I>&gt;<i> 	in the demo pages, gtk# IS very popular. So I find it odd that 
</I>&gt;<i> gtk# support for native
</I>&gt;<i> 	OSX is still perhaps completely out of sight, yet we could be 
</I>&gt;<i> close to having SWF for
</I>&gt;<i> 	native OSX now? and there are possibly some IP issue with SWF on 
</I>&gt;<i> linux/OSX. So the end
</I>&gt;<i> 	result of my thinking is .. is there not a disproportionate amount 
</I>&gt;<i> of time being spent
</I>&gt;<i> 	on SWF on native OSX than gtk# on native OSX? maybe the answer is -
</I>&gt;<i> that i am one
</I>&gt;<i> 	of about 5 people that care about using  gtk# on native OSX :(
</I>&gt;<i> 	Or perhaps SWF for native OSX came very easy? and gtk# for native 
</I>&gt;<i> OSX is very hard to implement? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -tl
