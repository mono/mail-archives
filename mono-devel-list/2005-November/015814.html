<PRE>Every so often my console applications won't close after main has  
exited. I know main has exited because I usually have a  
Console.WriteLine on the last line of main that tells me that main  
has exited, however mono keeps on running.
This doesn't happen every time, and I don't know if it has to do with  
heavy use of threading or remoting, which are both common to all my  
apps.
Also I have had this happen to me with XSP. If you run XSP with the  
default command line options it lets you hit enter to exit, however  
sometimes after running for a long time (remoting in use) hitting  
enter won't let xsp exit.

Any ideas what might be causing this?

I am using 1.1.9.2
