Incidentally (and this is not a personal reply, this is gereral to 
anyone interested), relating to the below reply, unlike .NET, in mono 
more than one thread can be processing the message loop, and delivering 
the same UI messages to more than one thread.

That is, more than one thread can run Application.Run() in mono, and 
that call will start a message processing and passing loop in each 
thread -- on mono anyway.  If you do this on Windows, the second call to 
Application.Run() will just return without doing anything if one is 
already running.

I've fixed this locally, but i'm trying to debug some semi-related 
issues with code which was previously using two Application.Run() calls 
(one per thread).  I'm trying to debug this from the mono side rather 
than the code side, because this code actually does run in Windows as it 
is written.  Not ready to talk about those specific fixes yet, because 
i'll not be convinced it's a good idea until I'm convinced it's a good 
idea (and until it's bug free; not there yet).

I spent all day yesterday staring at the laptop, I'm tempted to give 
myself the day off today, but i may change my mind after coffee and 
breakfast.
