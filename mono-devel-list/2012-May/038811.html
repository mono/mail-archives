<PRE>[this reply to list -- my earlier replies were off list, but i figure a 
public 'thanks' was in order..]

Thanks again to all that replied.  I am going to try again today using 
the following:

-i am installing to /home/.../mono -- and i am going to give another 
shot at the git version rather than tarball from apt-get source...  That 
environment setup script looks like it'll be a big help.

-I am going to make sure at minimum mono.addins and gtk-sharp are also 
installed to gac, will probably build them from source if i can, if not 
i'll try a gacutil -i to install binaries.  I just hope i don't get 
bizarre version conflicts like i need 0.6.0.0 of mono.addins and i can 
only find 0.6.2.0 and it won't consider them compatible -- but then 
again, if that's a monodevelop thing, i guess i can always rebuild that 
from source and maybe that will resolve this.

</I>&gt;<i> mscorlib never is. Any library which invokes native functions in the
</I>&gt;<i> mono native library (libmono.so) is not safe to share. Any pure .NET
</I>&gt;<i> library which does not invoke functions in libmono.so is potentially
</I>&gt;<i> safe, but it is completely unsupported and if you try it and it
</I>&gt;<i> breaks, we will just recommend you compile a clean version and don't
</I>&gt;<i> copy assemblies between different versions of mono.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's what I've been following repeatedly with different mono versions

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think one of the key differences compared to how I understand what

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> completely to not mix with any directory commonly used. I.e. f&#246;r Mono

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mono-2.10.8
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Repeat the --prefix clause on every configure script in the same &quot;set&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of packages. It will then all install neatly and not corrupt anything.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Couple that with a helper script as detailed on the page to setup the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> correct environment variables, and things seems to work out rather
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nicely.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, remember that for everything except libgdiplus and mono itself,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you need to be inside the environment created by the script in order
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for the builds of the remaining packages to build against the intended
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mono version.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've attached some notes from when I last built mono 2.10, with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> configure invocations and expected output I used. At the top a list a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> number of native dependencies that I was able to satisfy using regular
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> apt-get. I also attach the helper scripts I use to execute mono for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this environment - these two files are the only ones that go in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /usr/local/bin. After having installed libgdiplus and mono you should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be able to do:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> $ mono210 mono --version
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> $ source mono210env
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [mono210]$ mono --version
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When that is working, you can have a look at remaining packages if you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like. Remember to do this from &quot;inside&quot; &quot;source mono210env&quot;.
