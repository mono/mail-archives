<PRE>Hi there!

Yes yes! I've being using a lot of the .Net platform in the past and although the factors of licensing costs affect me negatively, I do find the .net platform to a be high quality framework. With that being said, I really do like open source and having the mono framework is the perfect bridge for me :) I would love to have mono sitting on enterprise servers one day as novell is doing. I would love to know where do I start developing the mono framework itself to introduce more components and features to suit the enterprise. I do know of the enterprise library from microsoft. I have a few concerns of the future of mono being under threat from microsoft one day. Also, how does one know or find out how to build these components into mono without stamping on microsoft's feet? 

I'm assuming all mono's assemblies are written in C# and compiled as .net dlls?

Please help as and when you can, I would really love to use mono instead of other open source languages such as scala, java or ruby.

Many thanks for your informative reply!

Hey Adhir, thanks for emailing!

The Mono development experience is very similar to Java.  If you
are familiar with Visual Studio or Eclipse, you should feel quite at home.
 Mono is a cross-platform implementation of the Common Langauge Runtime,
and includes most of the features provided by Microsoft's implementation
(called the Microsoft .NET Framework).  The entire purpose of these
implementations is simply to run C# code (and some other less common
languages), which provide way to write code that is inherently fast and
cross-platform - on the surface, it is very much like Java.

&quot;Using&quot; Mono boils down to writing C#, so you will need to know it.
 MonoDevelop is the tool of choice for developing Mono applications - there
are lots of C# tutorials out there.  Most of these tutorials are aimed at
Visual Studio - you could use that too (but only on Windows) - and
MonoDevelop is very similar, so you should have no problem following the
tutorials.  You can get MonoDevelop here: <A HREF="http://www.monodevelop.com">http://www.monodevelop.com</A>

Mono has some slight differences and extra features that you might find
interesting.  There is a wealth of information on
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com,">http://www.mono-project.com,</A> and Googling for information on Mono features
works out quite well.

You may also want to start a discussion on mono-list - lots of people who
work with Mono are subscribed to that list.  (On this list we generally
discuss how we can develop Mono itself)

Good luck, and feel free to ask any further questions.
