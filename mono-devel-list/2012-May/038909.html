<PRE>I was just looking at this old 'bug' from the Novell's bugzilla:

<A HREF="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=321541">https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=321541</A>

Some stuff was fixed for that bug some 6 years ago, but it hasn't been 
closed yet because they didn't understand why the events were being 
delivered to both threads.

The answer is because both threads in the sample code are processing the 
same event queue by virtue of calling Application.Run() which is the 
event processor, and there is only one event queue per application.  I 
read this somewhere on msdn today when i was googling information 
related to the problem.  Only one thread should be processing the event 
queue.

Does anyone here have the authority to close old Novell bugs such as 
this one?  It would make it easier to get an idea of what is actually 
still broken versus what needs to be fixed.

I am only writing here because i saw very few people were being cc'd 
when i made a comment on it stating this much.
