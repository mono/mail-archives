<PRE>Ok, I've managed to get rid of most of my errors via using the
parallel build environment configuration...

But I've got one more error preventing me from proceeding with what i
wanted to work on, and i think it's related to gtk-sharp, in which
case i'm either asking on the wrong mailing list (probably) or maybe i
should find another version of gtk-sharp(?) to try to build.

Here's the problem copied/pasted directly from command line of both programs:
mono: symbol lookup error:
/home/robwilkens/mono/lib/libglibsharpglue-2.so: undefined symbol:
g_thread_supported

Oddly enough, i tried googling the error message (copy/paste) from
libglibsharpglue to the end of the line, and nothing came up..  I
guess i'm the first one to run across this particular problem, or at
least the first to ask publicly.

I get the same error from both programs that i was trying to test
before (namely: monodevelop and GhettoGtkAdmin)...

Is this mono or should i look for a gtk-sharp mailing list and ask there?

Thanks,
Rob
