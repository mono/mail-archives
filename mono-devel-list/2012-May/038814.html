<PRE>I think i can work around this..  Though I want to document this here 
because i think something went wrong...

I searched the mono (_not_ the gtk-sharp) source and found this:

./eglib/src/glib.h:#define g_thread_supported()   TRUE

But oddly enough i could _not_ find glib.h in the installed mono 
directory....  This is not to say it should be..  but something was 
looking for that macro in gtk-sharp.

I get the distinct impression that i can just redefine 
g_thread_supported() in the local copy of gtk-sharp source to 'true' and 
it will work after i rebuild it.

If it doesn't and if i can't figure out another work-around, I'll be 
back here later.

If you don't hear from me, presume it worked.
