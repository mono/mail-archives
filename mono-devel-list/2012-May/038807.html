</I>
No - thats not true.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Only read further if you're interested in my struggle. &#160;I am basically
</I>&gt;<i> writing this to say why i probably won't be able to debug this issue i
</I>&gt;<i> earlier reported myself. &#160;Anyone know if i should file a bug report on that
</I>&gt;<i> one?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First, i tried building mono from the latest git source, but despite
</I>&gt;<i> compiling and installing fine it gave me enough problems with compatibility
</I>&gt;<i> with existing programs, that i just thought i'd try the same version i was
</I>&gt;<i> already running on the system.
</I>



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, So i'll get to where i'm at now:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) I did an &quot;apt-get source mono&quot; ran an autogen, make..... (and eventually
</I>&gt;<i> make install) -- figuring this would get me the same version that i was
</I>&gt;<i> running.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) This built, or would build, version 2.10.8.1 -- in theory the same
</I>&gt;<i> version i had installed.
</I>&gt;<i> 3) libmonogc.la in libgc directory never built (and it was needed by other
</I>&gt;<i> parts of the compile process.) &#160;There were no errors that i could tell; it
</I>&gt;<i> just said something like &quot;LD &#160;libmonogc.la&quot; in the output from the makefile
</I>&gt;<i> in that directory, and then continued on without actually building it. &#160;I
</I>&gt;<i> half wonder if i'm missing something important to build it with. &#160;I actually
</I>&gt;<i> had it echo the command line behind the 'LD' it was displaying, then tried
</I>&gt;<i> strace/ltrace on it, but got lost following it and my frustration just led
</I>&gt;<i> me to do the following:
</I>&gt;<i> 4) I copied the two missing 'libgc' libraries (the binaries) from the git
</I>&gt;<i> version which i earlier compiled.... &#160;Yes, i know it's not smart, but it got
</I>&gt;<i> the whole thing to compile. &#160;I then did make install.
</I>&gt;<i> 5) Afterwards:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I try to run monodevelop:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -It gives me a few errors,they basically all say Mono.Addins version 0.6.0.0
</I>&gt;<i> is not found.. I googled it and saw that the current version is something
</I>&gt;<i> like 0.6.2.0. &#160;I didn't bother redownloading it.
</I>&gt;<i> -But it is there, if i remove my /usr/local version of the mono binaries,
</I>&gt;<i> and run the same monodevelop, it runs
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I try to run GhettoGtkAdmin.exe (the binary from the project i gave
</I>&gt;<i> earlier):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -Direct from the command line without 'mono' command: It works fine, but i
</I>&gt;<i> suspect that this is using the /usr/bin version
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -If I run it with mono command (from /usr/local) i.e. 'mono
</I>&gt;<i> GhettoGtkAdmin.exe', it complains that it can't &quot;load type 'MainWindow'&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> which is one of the types in the program -- it's a System.TypeLoadException.
</I>&gt;<i> -- but again, like monodevelop, if i remove the /usr/local version of the
</I>&gt;<i> binaries for mono, it runs fine even with the 'mono' in the command line.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I even ran a 'make check' in the mono source directory, and most (or many)
</I>&gt;<i> of the tests passed -- at some point one of the check's failed to compile
</I>&gt;<i> (the test source for Address.cs in versiontolerantserialization test was
</I>&gt;<i> missing it said.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I tried running a build from apt-get source of libmono-addins, and i was
</I>&gt;<i> going to rebuild monodevelop too, but i thought this was getting a little
</I>&gt;<i> nuts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I realize i'm on my own with building from apt-get source, as these are
</I>&gt;<i> ubuntu files and not mono project files. &#160;But i've put in enough time on
</I>&gt;<i> this problem. &#160;I'm retired/disabled, i've got plenty of time, but there's a
</I>&gt;<i> reason i'm disabled and it's not a physical disability. &#160;This is generating
</I>&gt;<i> enough unneeded stress that i don't think this activity which i took on as a
</I>&gt;<i> stress reliever is working out that way, it's more having the opposite
</I>&gt;<i> effect. &#160;I swear i used to find programming to be one of those activities
</I>&gt;<i> that relaxed me, i don't know if it's the illness, age, or years of being on
</I>&gt;<i> disability (not working full time), but nowadays it just seems like more
</I>&gt;<i> stress than it's worth for me.
