<PRE>No problem, I love the enthusiasm.  I couldn't tell you how to get involved
in the Mono project - someone else will point you in the right direction.

There is no way to know what Microsoft will do and if they really feel that
their toes are being stepped on, but Mono has a lot going for it.
 Microsoft has developed and published the CLR under the Microsoft
Community Promise.  I think this basically means that Mono's core CLR
implementation is safe.  Microsoft has even provided Mono some guidance and
clarification on the details of the standard.  The legal safety of the
libraries outside of the core framework are not quite as clear - Microsoft
has not stated any &quot;opinion&quot; on Mono's capabilities, but they've had plenty
of time to act.  If Microsoft pulls the rug out from under Mono, I think
people may choose against Visual Studio in favor of Java due to portability
issues, and Microsoft doesn't want that.  If Oracle loses their case
against Google, it may suggest that all of Microsoft's public-facing
interfaces can legally be reimplemented.  If Oracle wins, Google might take
a serious look at the Mono framework as an alternative.  (this is so very
exciting!)  There's more information here:
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_(software">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_(software</A>)#Mono_and_Microsoft.27s_patents

Yes, Mono's assemblies are all written in C#.  They compile using Mono's C#
compiler, but I have been able to compile them under Visual Studio too
(that takes a bit of organizing).  At the &quot;bottom&quot; of those framework
libraries are internal and P/Invoke calls that bridge the core
functionality with native functions.

Before you get too far ahead of yourself, get MonoDevelop and play around a
bit - see what might benefit from your contributions.

</I>&gt;<i> Hey Adhir, thanks for emailing!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Mono development experience is very similar to Java.  If you
</I>&gt;<i> are familiar with Visual Studio or Eclipse, you should feel quite at home.
</I>&gt;<i>  Mono is a cross-platform implementation of the Common Langauge Runtime,
</I>&gt;<i> and includes most of the features provided by Microsoft's implementation
</I>&gt;<i> (called the Microsoft .NET Framework).  The entire purpose of these
</I>&gt;<i> implementations is simply to run C# code (and some other less common
</I>&gt;<i> languages), which provide way to write code that is inherently fast and
</I>&gt;<i> cross-platform - on the surface, it is very much like Java.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Using&quot; Mono boils down to writing C#, so you will need to know it.
</I>&gt;<i>  MonoDevelop is the tool of choice for developing Mono applications - there
</I>&gt;<i> are lots of C# tutorials out there.  Most of these tutorials are aimed at
</I>&gt;<i> Visual Studio - you could use that too (but only on Windows) - and
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop is very similar, so you should have no problem following the
</I>&gt;<i> tutorials.  You can get MonoDevelop here: <A HREF="http://www.monodevelop.com">http://www.monodevelop.com</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mono has some slight differences and extra features that you might find
</I>&gt;<i> interesting.  There is a wealth of information on
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com,">http://www.mono-project.com,</A> and Googling for information on Mono
</I>&gt;<i> features works out quite well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You may also want to start a discussion on mono-list - lots of people who
</I>&gt;<i> work with Mono are subscribed to that list.  (On this list we generally
</I>&gt;<i> discuss how we can develop Mono itself)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good luck, and feel free to ask any further questions.
