<PRE>Hey Adhir, thanks for emailing!

The Mono development experience is very similar to Java.  If you
are familiar with Visual Studio or Eclipse, you should feel quite at home.
 Mono is a cross-platform implementation of the Common Langauge Runtime,
and includes most of the features provided by Microsoft's implementation
(called the Microsoft .NET Framework).  The entire purpose of these
implementations is simply to run C# code (and some other less common
languages), which provide way to write code that is inherently fast and
cross-platform - on the surface, it is very much like Java.

&quot;Using&quot; Mono boils down to writing C#, so you will need to know it.
 MonoDevelop is the tool of choice for developing Mono applications - there
are lots of C# tutorials out there.  Most of these tutorials are aimed at
Visual Studio - you could use that too (but only on Windows) - and
MonoDevelop is very similar, so you should have no problem following the
tutorials.  You can get MonoDevelop here: <A HREF="http://www.monodevelop.com">http://www.monodevelop.com</A>

Mono has some slight differences and extra features that you might find
interesting.  There is a wealth of information on
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com,">http://www.mono-project.com,</A> and Googling for information on Mono features
works out quite well.

You may also want to start a discussion on mono-list - lots of people who
work with Mono are subscribed to that list.  (On this list we generally
discuss how we can develop Mono itself)

Good luck, and feel free to ask any further questions.
