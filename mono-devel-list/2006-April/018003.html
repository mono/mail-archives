I can't say much about SWF (never used it on windows neither linux, the
API looks horrible though IMHO), but I have experience in developing and
deploying cross-plattform desktop applications.
We use Mono + Gtk# + Glade# + Glade UI designer + MonoDevelop for
developing the applications on Linux workstations, and test them and
deploy them on Windows with MS .NET + Gtk#, which works very good. But
you have to test your applications from time to time, sometimes the API
behaves a bit different on Mono than MS .NET (which is usually a bug and
becomes fixed once you reported it), but that has to be kept in mind,
but thats also the case for free Java runtimes.
I guess you could also do for development: MS .NET + Gtk# + Glade# +
Glade UI designer + VS.NET, or replace VS.NET with SharpDevelop.
The project we use this for is large, it's an allround insurance broker
software.
All applications that are developed now are written in C# instead of C++
as we did before.
The project is not complete cross-plattform yet because there are still
parts written in C++ using Borland's VCL which is even less
cross-platform than SWF. But soon the complete suite will run on Linux
too.

IMHO writing cross-platform applications in C# (or any other CLI
implemented language) is easier than writing them in other languages.
