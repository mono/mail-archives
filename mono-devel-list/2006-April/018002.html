No, there isn't.

Indeed, it would be nice to have a .wapi-less config or at
least to make the current implementation setuid(2) safe.

This means that all shm ops have to be configurable, unless
there is a way to make them working with setuid, which doesn't
work in all Linux kernel versions, AFAIK.
