<PRE>Hi,

I'm not sure if the buildsys for Fedora RPMS is bust or the makefiles
are bust in mono, so I'll ask here first for advice and then try and
backtrack.

This problem *only* occurs on anything not 32 bit.

If I define _libdir to point to /usr/lib and then build the rpm, I'm
still finding that the .pc files are ending up in /usr/lib64 which means
that anything trying to build against or install against an rpm won't
work as the .pc file isn't in /usr/lib/pkgconfig (which is where it
would be expected to be found).

To prove the point, if I explicitly say that libdir=/usr/lib64 (as has
been suggested before), then part of the code is being built in /usr/lib
and part in /usr/lib64 instead of everything being in /usr/lib64

Is there a reason for these behaviours to be seen and if there is, is
there a way around the problem? Is the makefile under mono broken or is
it the Fedora buildsys?

TTFN
