</I>
I have wondered why it was based on mcs as a new compiler.  I would
have thought that Microsoft made enough changes to VB.NET in order to
make it conform to the CLR that it could be translated fairly directly
to C#, in which case that would seem to me to be an easier and more
maintainable compiler (and it would also get all the improvements in
mcs).

&gt;<i> * The runtime is still there, and its today probably the most important
</I>&gt;<i>   piece, as it allows existing VB.NET applications to run on Mono.
</I>
Can this runtime be accessed from C#, or is it purely used by the VB compiler?
