It would be a mechanism not necessarily automatic, it could be
hard-coded. For example the event that counts executed instructions
should be set by the user to generate no more than, say 1000 interrupts
per second. A similar mechanism is in place for /dev/rtc (though in that
case the default limit is an almost uses 64 Hz). When the user asks for
a value that would generate too much overhead, it is either capped or
an error is returned.
Since assigning limits to all the possible events would be a pain, it
would be fine to allow the users to just access the most important 4-5
events.
Increasing too much the load on a box is the only security issue that,
IMHO, requires root for oprofile. So, with the proper limit, it should
not be too hard to allow this.

</I>
I meant virtualization of the counter values per-process. At the time I
looked, the values read from the counters were system-wide.
Multiplexing is of course a good feature to have (someone working on the
kernel should likely do it for /dev/rtc, too).

Thanks!
