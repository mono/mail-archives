No yet.  Expression Templates are possible in C++ because templates are
a turing-complete sub-language within C++; C++ templates were never
designed to support expression templates, it was just a discovery that
expression templates were possible within the C++ template system.

C# generics do not contain such flexibility (by design).

C# 3.0 may be able to support something similar (maybe), via the
Expression&lt;T&gt; classes, which causes the compiler to generate an
Expression&lt;T&gt; tree instead of IL for a given expression, e.g.

	Expression&lt;T&gt; e = x =&gt; x + 1;

This is to permit DLINQ to grab the actual expression entered by the
user and convert it to SQL.

It's conceivable that this mechanism could be used to &quot;fake&quot; expression
templates, allowing some method to examine the actual expression and
optimize it for your particular classes.

However, this would only be possible within C# 3.0, which isn't
finalized (or otherwise remotely close to shipping).

&gt;<i> 2. Is template processed at compile time or run time in C#? I know
</I>&gt;<i> that in C++ it's processed at compile time.
</I>
It depends on what you mean by &quot;processed.&quot;

Generic types are &quot;processed&quot; by the C# compiler (compile time) to
ensure type safety, checking that e.g. strings are actually inserted
into a List&lt;string&gt;.

Generic types are &quot;processed&quot; by the JIT compiler as well (run time)
when &quot;inflating&quot; the class (producing the actual List&lt;string&gt; type for
use at runtime).  This permits optimal code reuse (List&lt;string&gt; uses the
same JITed code as List&lt;object&gt; and List&lt;OtherReferenceTypes&gt;) across
assemblies, while the C++ approach requires code duplication between
assemblies.
 
&gt;<i> 3. I know that in C# the assignment operator '=' for object will copy
</I>&gt;<i> the reference of rhs to the lhs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How about if we need to define an assignment operator for an object
</I>&gt;<i> that needs to copy the value of member variables (not reference) of
</I>&gt;<i> rhs to lhs?
</I>&gt;<i> How do we tell C# to copy value, not reference?
</I>
You don't use the assignment operator, you use a method:

	lhs.Assign (rhs); // or Copy, or some other method name...

Ultimately, this is what C++/CLI is doing for you &quot;under the covers&quot; as
well...
