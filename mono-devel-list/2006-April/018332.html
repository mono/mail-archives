<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Yep, that's exactly what I was observing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now I wonder if this is a VS2005 or VS2003 related problem...
</I>
I guess the biggest reason is that most of VC project files are
missing. I checked right now in 1.1.15, and I can only see mono.sln,
genmdesc.vcproj, libmono.vcproj and mono.vcproj. VSDependencies also
does not contain the projects. Last time I checked they were not in
the svn either. That makes me wonder how exactly people have succeeded
compiling mono, but oh well :)

&gt;<i> cygwin is required/useful for
</I>&gt;<i> * autogen, which creates some required files;
</I>&gt;<i> * running some tools, like genmdesc and monoburg;
</I>&gt;<i> * testing the results (runtime tests);
</I>&gt;<i> * building the class libraries (and running the unit tests);
</I>&gt;<i> The last two items make cygwin worth installing
</I>
Yes. Except if you don't install it for religious reasons!

Getting genmdesc and monoburg to run only required bison and some
custom build rules in Visual Studio. That was even faster than setting
up cygwin for me. And we only embed mono, so a compiled libmono is all
I ever need.

&gt;<i> Optimization affecting the stack frames have been reported to cause
</I>&gt;<i> problems. Of course other things may cause problems too.
</I>
Yes, that is the place that required some VS specific pragmas (stack
frames) in some places. Other than that, libmono just works. And the
produced dll size is smaller than the one built by cygwin - that's
something that really matters for us.
