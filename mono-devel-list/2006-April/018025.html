No. Really. Managed code help you in loads of usual problems while
programming and deploying, but paying attention to CPU and memory issues
is something you need in *every* language currently available. If you
don't mind those you may end up with a bloated and slow program.

&gt;<i>   In any case, regardless of the efficacy of the program I've written,
</I>&gt;<i> the point that mono developers must ponder is that other coders
</I>&gt;<i> following my footsteps will code exactly the same way, the way that

</I>&gt;<i> mono, but always aborts under .NET, they will claim it is a bug in
</I>&gt;<i> Mono.
</I>
I don't know why the Mono implementation does not work as the MS one,
but even in MS .NET I would use the pattern described in my last e-mail,
so I wouldn't even notice the difference. Is there any Mono guru reading
this e-mail?

&gt;<i>   It does appear I overlooked a join() call, which forces the first
</I>&gt;<i> thread to deadlock until the abort happens.  However, I never had the
</I>&gt;<i> problem of a failing abort in .NET.  In this case, I could care less
</I>&gt;<i> if the thread aborted a few hundred milliseconds to one second later
</I>&gt;<i> than the main thread.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   As I indicated earlier, I set a variable which caused my routine to
</I>&gt;<i> bail, causing the thread to naturally abort (similar to your proposal,
</I>&gt;<i> but more crude).  This method will work in all versions, .NET and
</I>&gt;<i> Mono.
</I>
IIRC, you can also #ifdef for the appropriate action. But that would
turn .NET's binaries incompatible with Mono.

Cheers,
