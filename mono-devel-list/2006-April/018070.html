Sure - but surely you define an interface, and the environment can
define a localised implementation for your flavour of UNIX.

Hopefully this would not be Linux specific, but would be achievable
on Solaris and *BSD too. (And who cares about AIX, eh? ;-))

I don't think Mono should have to ship with all possible
implementations - a couple and a null implementation that throws
NotImplemented or similar should be enough.
