<PRE>Hi,

Yes. It's quite nice. Okay, it needs updating to 1.1.15, but this isn't
the right list for discussion on that.

Is there?

Monodevelop is not in FC-extras yet. It is currently awaiting approval.

And that doesn't surprise me.

Okay, quick fix (won't work on 64bit fedora core currently). Open a
terminal window

su
yum -y install fedora-rpmdevtools
exit

rpm -ihv *.src.rpm

rpm -ihv rpmbuild/i386/*
exit
rpmbuild -ba rpmbuild/SPECS/ikvm.spec
su
rpm -ihv rpmbuild/i386/ikvm*
exit

(you'll need to do this after each package being built - change ikvm for
the name of the package)

rpmbuild -ba rpmbuild/SPECS/monodoc.spec
rpmbuild -ba rpmbuild/SPECS/mono-debugger.spec
rpmbuild -ba rpmbuild/SPECS/monodevelop.spec

If you want to server ASP.NET files via Apache

rpmbuild -ba rpmbuild/SPECS/xsp.spec
rpmbuild -ba rpmbuild/SPECS/mod_mono.spec

If the build process stops and says you need a particular package,

yum -y install &lt;package-name&gt;

That lot may look a bit hairy, but if you follow my instructions, it
will be quite painless.

I've not put the rpms up on the Salford server as they're not required
for Fedora Extras approval.

You now have just about all of the rpms available installed on your
machine. Any problems, please email me directly (or report them here). I
am pushing quite hard for these to be included into Fedora Extras, but
things are a tad slow with the chaps currently.

It may be worth joining the fedora-extras list as well and poking there.
