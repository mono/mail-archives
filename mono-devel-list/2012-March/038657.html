First of all thanks Alp to answer to my mails as the only one on this list.

Thanks for the link to the page and the Debian Mono packaging team, but 
I know that page already. I'm maintaining the complete mono stack at 
Arch Linux more than 4 (nearly 5) years now. The packages are all 
packaged well and everything is working since ages.

Debian and Arch Linux are too different in packaging to do any 
coordinating here. Personally (and I mean really personally, no official 
statement of Arch Linux) I get lost in the number of packages Debian 
has, I mean there is one mono-2.10.8.tar.bz2 source package and Debian 
is making nearly hundreds (haven't count all the packages, such a rough 
guess) of packages out of it. Nevertheless, this is another topic.

I'm just a little bit disappointed from the mono developers and their 
information policy, that's all. It was easier when they were at Novell, 
but I think setting up a new company and deal with all the needed stuff 
around the company consuming a lot of time. Hopefully they will update 
the &quot;sources-stable&quot; webpage regularly again in the near future or give 
some other information on the stable versions.

Regards,
Daniel
