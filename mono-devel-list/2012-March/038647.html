<PRE>Hey guys,

Just a heads-up of what we are planning.

We are very close to release the first version of Mono 2.11 [1] which will
be the public preview for Mono 3.0.   The major features of Mono 3.0 will
be that we now consider SGen production-grade, we have a complete C# 5
implementation and our default profile will become 4.5 with all of the
async goodness you can expect.

As part of our efforts to bring Mono 2.11 out (see [1]), we are also
bringing back to life the public continuous integration build system that
we developed previously (Wrench) and will have build lanes for a few of
platforms (Starting with OpenSUSE, Windows and Mac on x86, and adding more
as time goes by, or community contributors that want us to check stuff in a
different configuration).   Ideally, you should be able to get packages for
the main platforms on a daily basis.   This will come in handy in our beta
period while fix any kinks on Mono 2.11 that will lead to the magnificent
3.0 release.

The .NET team has been doing some work to get async better supported on the
class libraries, so we will be bringing back the class status pages for
anyone that wants to help complete the async stack to help us out.

Ideally, we should have 3.0 done in a couple of months.

Miguel

[1] This has taken longer than we wanted because we had to rebuild all of
our build infrastructure and reset everything from zero.   And also because
we had been very busy with the launch of Xamarin, so that has taken a lot
of our attention.
