<PRE>Hi,

I would like to take part in GSoC this year.
During my research i had found many interesting projects, but only one truly
got my attention:

&quot;GTK# Applications&quot;

Mono is something new to me. To be honest, today i used it for the first
time :) (but i heard about it though)
To the point:
My head is usually full of concepts, two for starters

1.Application &quot;better life&quot; which will help people in fields such as:
-planning home budget,
-sport (training planner etc),
-diet planner
-maybe some plugin for social networks
-... 
example of use case:
&quot;User want to lose a little bit weight. Application will help people turn
their motivation into the regular training. So, user chooses a 'sport' from
menu, then he sets the training program (maybe by himself, maybe there will
be some prepared a priori)
and from now, he will be reminded about events that are in his plan&quot;
&quot;User sets home budget planner with his personal data such as salary and
loans. He wants to save 10% of his salary this month. Application will
measure how much money user can spent daily that at the end of month he will
have 10% of salary saved.&quot;
...

2. &quot;Entertain me!&quot; application which will be perfect for procrastination
time :)
Application will search Internet for interesting informations, pictures,
news etc. (this is very wide area to discuss)
...

I will make some concept sketches later, maybe that will help clarify my
ideas.

About me: 
My name is Simon and i was born 23 years ago. I'm studying at Gdansk
University of Technology (Poland). I have an engineer(bachelor) degree, and
i am still learning to gain MSc.
I'm using Fedora/Ubuntu/Windows. I know c# &gt; c++ &gt; c &gt; python &gt; java , but i
am open-minded person and i am eager to learn something new :)
As you can see I am not a native speaker and i hope that we will understand
each other. :)

With best wishes,

homerf44
