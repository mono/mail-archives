&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to take part in GSoC this year.
</I>&gt;<i> During my research i had found many interesting projects, but only one truly
</I>&gt;<i> got my attention:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;GTK# Applications&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mono is something new to me. To be honest, today i used it for the first
</I>&gt;<i> time :) (but i heard about it though)
</I>&gt;<i> To the point:
</I>&gt;<i> My head is usually full of concepts, two for starters
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.Application &quot;better life&quot; which will help people in fields such as:
</I>&gt;<i> -planning home budget,
</I>&gt;<i> -sport (training planner etc),
</I>&gt;<i> -diet planner
</I>&gt;<i> -maybe some plugin for social networks
</I>&gt;<i> -...
</I>&gt;<i> example of use case:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;User want to lose a little bit weight. Application will help people turn
</I>&gt;<i> their motivation into the regular training. So, user chooses a 'sport' from
</I>&gt;<i> menu, then he sets the training program (maybe by himself, maybe there will
</I>&gt;<i> be some prepared a priori)
</I>&gt;<i> and from now, he will be reminded about events that are in his plan&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;User sets home budget planner with his personal data such as salary and
</I>&gt;<i> loans. He wants to save 10% of his salary this month. Application will
</I>&gt;<i> measure how much money user can spent daily that at the end of month he will
</I>&gt;<i> have 10% of salary saved.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. &quot;Entertain me!&quot; application which will be perfect for procrastination
</I>&gt;<i> time :)
</I>&gt;<i> Application will search Internet for interesting informations, pictures,
</I>&gt;<i> news etc. (this is very wide area to discuss)
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will make some concept sketches later, maybe that will help clarify my
</I>&gt;<i> ideas.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> About me:
</I>&gt;<i> My name is Simon and i was born 23 years ago. I'm studying at Gdansk
</I>&gt;<i> University of Technology (Poland). I have an engineer(bachelor) degree, and
</I>&gt;<i> i am still learning to gain MSc.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm using Fedora/Ubuntu/Windows. I know c# &gt; c++ &gt; c &gt; python &gt; java , but i
</I>&gt;<i> am open-minded person and i am eager to learn something new :)
</I>&gt;<i> As you can see I am not a native speaker and i hope that we will understand
</I>&gt;<i> each other. :)
</I>
You're certainly welcome to submit this proposal, but you should be
aware that the bar for &quot;new&quot; applications like this is much higher,
since you have to argue that the app is viable and needed as well as
demonstrating your ability to implement it.

Note also that you can submit multiple proposals, if there are other
projects that interest you.
