<PRE>Hello list,
Since this is my first post, let me introduce myself.
My name is Lorenzo Dematte', I live and work in Italy and I'm 31. I am
currently employed in a software company that build automation systems for
public transport using open source software.
My goal there is to renew their current systems, based mainly on C and
ad-hoc servers and protocols, one piece at the time.
I come from the MS world, therefore a natural choice for me is to use Mono.

I have read on Miguel's blog that you are looking for help in implementing
part of the ASP.NET stack using async functionatlities, and I decided it
was something great to do!
I am finishing a major project at work this week, after that I will have
some spare time so.. I'd like to help!
On the plus side, I have a good experience with fairly low level hacking on
the CLR (my master thesis was on extensions to the &quot;Rotor&quot; C# compiler and
CLR (do you remember &quot;Rotor&quot;? :) ) for injecting and checking temporal
invariants on class variables over multiple threads).
Also, I have good experience with async programming, both as a &quot;user&quot; of
async apis, and as a designer (I have designed a DI framework with method
calls over multiple tasks for my previous employer, and in 2009 I have done
an intership at MSR on parallel computing with continuations for C# and
F#).
On the minus side, I have neves seen the Mono source code, and I haven't
done any major contribution to OSS... but I want to start and this is a
project that I like and that gets me excited!

Anyway, I need to know from you guys how to proceed.
I suppose that for this kind of project you can't just pull from git and
the submit a push request when its done..
Is there someone coordinating the efforts so that duplicate work can be
minimized?
Has someone already done a design phase, identified the areas to patch, and
what needs to be done?
Is a review of the Mono ASP.NET &lt;<A HREF="http://asp.net/">http://asp.net/</A>&gt; stack needed?
... and many other questions.

Hopefully I could be able to contribute to this project, let me know how I
can help!

Best,
Lorenzo Dematte'
