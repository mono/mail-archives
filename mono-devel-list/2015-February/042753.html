Technically, there are both shell scripts (no extension) and batch files
(.bat). The batch files aren't using cygpath, but the shell scripts are.

In testing, I couldn't get msys to do anything useful, and took an
executive decision not to care about it for the 3.12 release - support
for Cygwin and cmd.exe was enough to get some testing &amp; feedback.

I'd welcome a decent fix, though. That mangling is done at
<A HREF="https://github.com/mono/release/blob/master/defs/mono#L102">https://github.com/mono/release/blob/master/defs/mono#L102</A>

&gt;<i> Since all of them are using &quot;cygpath -w /path/to/dir&quot;, for now as a

</I>&gt;<i> Another improvements for the installers would be to set an environment

</I>
I assume that'd be handled somewhere in
<A HREF="https://github.com/mono/release/blob/master/resources/Product.wxs">https://github.com/mono/release/blob/master/resources/Product.wxs</A> ?
Sorry, I'm not an expert on WiX, someone else contributed that.

&gt;<i> On Windows XP, with SP3 and the VC redist package installed, mono.exe and
</I>&gt;<i> mono-sgen.exe won't start with the following error:
</I>&gt;<i> mono.exe is not a valid Win32 application.
</I>
It's super hard to care about XP, which ended its life a year ago.

mono-sgen.exe and mono.exe (and mono-boehm.exe) are compiled with
MSVC++2013, and possibly some compiler flag or parameter in the vcxproj
files is incompatible with XP - but I wouldn't know which one, and I
haven't tested at all with XP.

&gt;<i> Other binaries like pkg-config.exe or mprof-report.exe can be run correctly.
</I>
mprof-report etc are still compiled with Cygwin against a mingw target.
pkg-config.exe is provided verbatim from a binary download from
gnome.org - I assume they build on linux with a mingw cross-compiler.
