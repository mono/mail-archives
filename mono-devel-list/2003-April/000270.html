<PRE>Hi

&gt;<i> I'm sorry, is it correct that this code closes the socket
</I>&gt;<i> on send or receive timeout? If so I don't think that's
</I>&gt;<i> right. I believe that on systems that do support setting of
</I>&gt;<i> SO_RCVTIMEO and SO_SNDTIMEO the way to go is obviously to
</I>&gt;<i> employ these options. On systems that do not support these
</I>&gt;<i> I would call select or poll with appropriate timeout just
</I>&gt;<i> before send/recv.
</I>Arg. You are right and i am wrong, the ms .net cli leaves the socket 
open even after a timeout.

At least this would provide a fallback for systems witch don't 
implement SO_RCVTIMEO as most application would simply close the socket 
after a timeout.

The second option would be to only abort the thread which is waiting 
for the send/receive. Is this possible with mono? The ms framework 
would abort the thread after send/receive method would return.

Does anyone know how java does this on linux?
