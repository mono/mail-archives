<PRE>After surviving a series of computer failures throughout our network, and
ultimately a two-week outage of our internet connection, I'm finally able to
work on a project I opened at SourceForge a while ago. I became fascinated
by the possibility of running Mono (and thereby a wide variety of .NET code)
on a StrongARM-based Palm device. As I thought about how to structure that
kind of system, I realized that it would be sufficiently different from a
desktop port of Mono that it should probably have its own project.
Therefore, I created the Mano project at SourceForge.

<A HREF="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/mano">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/mano</A>

It is, of course, only in the initial stages of planning, but I'd like to
invite PalmOS 5 programmers and Mano programmers (especially those who have
worked with the ARM port) to stop by and share their thoughts. Thank you for
your time.
