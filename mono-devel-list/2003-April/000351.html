<PRE>Hi,
 
I am trying to get the XSP code behind test to work. When I run it it
fails saying it can't find the code behind .
Other - non code behind tests seem to work OK. (I am using mono 0.23 and
xsp 0.3 on WindowsXP box)
The error message is:
 
--------------------------------
Parser Error

Description: Error parsing a resource required to service this request.
Review your source file and modify it to fix this error. 

Error message: Directory '/D:/cygwin/usr/stefan/WebTest/server/test/bin'
not found. 
 
Source Error: 
 
Line 1: &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot; &gt;
Line 2: &lt;HTML&gt;
 

Source File: D:\cygwin\usr\stefan\WebTest\server\test\codebehind1.aspx 
--------------------------------
 
It seems like it is confused by the / before D:/...
How do you fix this?
 
How does xsp find the path to the machine.config. When I start it it is
looking for a path C:\cygwin\home\lalo\go-mono\install\etc\mono that
does not exist on my machine. I had to create it so
server.exe can work. 
 
When I run just &quot;server.exe&quot; everything works fine, but in this case it
looks like server.exe is using Microsoft ASPX parser and compiler. I got
confident that everything works fine until I tried to
access a page that did not exist and got a Microsoft Error page
refferencing Microsoft .net framework 1.0. 
I also  noticed that mono error pages look similar, but don't have the
version at the bottom - It would be nice if they had. (I would be glad
to add this once I get everything to work)
 
For some reason server.exe is looking for mcs.bat in the servers virtual
root directory. I have mcs.bat in my windows directory but it refused to
use it. This is not a big deal but I am just curious. 
 
Stefan.
