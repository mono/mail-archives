&gt;<i> This is true, the problem is that the CreateMessageSink doesn't check the
</I>&gt;<i> process id. The cross appdomain channel should have the highest prio and
</I>&gt;<i> also be a part of the channel list.
</I>
Exactly, but as it must not be listed in the
ChannelServices.RegisteredChannels property are is the patch for that.
(ChannelServices-20030407.diff)

&gt;<i> It's really simple to add, just add a check for process id in
</I>&gt;<i> CreateMessageSink and add so the constructor of ChannelData save's the
</I>&gt;<i> current process id (as it does with AppDomainID).
</I>
This was exactly this. However, the CrossAppDomainChannel.cs file is located
in the corlib, which does not seem to provide any way to get the current
process ID. I have added an internal call to the static function
System.Diagnostics.Process::GetPid_internal. But I don't know if I can just
add a reference to the existing icall function, or if I have to define a new
one with the appropriate name (Which would be nicer).

Anyway, I attached with this post patch files for this issue.
