<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> &gt; A while back I mailed in some patches for Bitmap.cs and Image.cs which 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; never seem to have made it into cvs. I am submitting them again, as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; diffs against cvs head (attached). This patch allows bitmaps to be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; loaded from disk, using Gdk.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I need to get this working in Mono in order to run Flat Four (see 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.379.com/flatfour/">http://www.379.com/flatfour/</A>) on Linux. If there is anything that I can 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do to help get these patches into the next release, please let me know.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Image.diff is ok (it's just a stuf), but Bitmap.diff would add a
</I>&gt;<i> dependency on libgdk.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We should not depend on that.
</I>
My feelings is that we could live with the dependency in the meantime.  
But Gonzalo is right in that we should consider what we will do in the
long term for implementing that functionality.  The dependency is not
something everyone might be excited about.

There is some reformatting of the code, large chunks of it that would
loose history.

Miguel.

</PRE>
