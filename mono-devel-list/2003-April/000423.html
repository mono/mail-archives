<PRE>&gt;<i> However, I'd appreciate it a lot if a few people could try it out.  Since
</I>&gt;<i> this release
</I>&gt;<i> focused mainly on the user interface comments are very welcome.  Especially,
</I>&gt;<i> if you find
</I>&gt;<i> something hard to use or have any suggestions on how the user interface can
</I>&gt;<i> be improved,
</I>&gt;<i> please let me know so that I can fix it.

OK here are a few comments.  The gui did work more like I expected.  I'm not
really sure what File is supposed to be for though since &quot;program to debug&quot; is
the item to really use.

The dialogs all worked correctly.

If there was a way to show the current configuration, libs, mappings etc, even
as a command line tool, it would have been enormously helpful as I was
troubleshooting my cvs build.

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to test much because the program is running but
not progressing.  If I hit the stop button I set after my source line 
Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello World&quot;); 

I see this:

Process @1 received signal 19 at #0: 0x4026a2a3 in sem_timedwait+0x4f7.
0x4026a2a3	mov    0x58(%ecx),%eax

CPU is running &gt; 90% 

I was able to step through using the instruction step instead of step over.

The program I tested (it happend on every program I tested)

public static int Main(string[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello World&quot;);		
    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello World completing&quot;);
    return 0;
}


I have a cvs build of mono,mcs, gtk-sharp and the debugger build referenced in
your email.
