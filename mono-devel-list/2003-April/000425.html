Are you going to post the same bug report every two days to the list
for the next few weeks or just three times like you did for the
floating point comparisons? In that case, tell us, so that we can make
the list management software delete two every three posts from you:-)

Here are some hints about doing bug reporting, we expect people that
subscribe to mono-devel-list to be clueful enough to follow at least
some of them.

1) submit a test case, the smaller it is, the better

2) use bugzilla.ximian.com to report the bug (in _addition_ to bugzilla,
posting to the list is fine if the bug merits larger exposure or design
discussions to solve; posting to the list twice or more is just a way to
annoy people and make them waste time, specially when you start a new
thread about it).

3) if the test involves libraries or assemblies that are not part of
mono, add info about where to download all the dependencies, and how to
compile/install them.

4) if compiling the test case requires more than:
	mcs test.cs
provide the full command line you used to compile the test.

5) if running the test requires more than:
	mono/mini test.exe
provide the _full_ command line needed to replicate the bug.

6) provide info about the version of the software you're using
(both mono and the operating system or relevant libraries).

7) provide the output you expect the test case to produce

8) provide the actual output _you_ get from the test case

A good bug report complies with at least 6 items from the list.
If your bug report complies with 3 or less items, it is very poor
and it means it will take much more time to fix (when it's not ignored).

Thanks.

PS For the sake of not seeing the same bug report again in two days, I
fixed the issue in cvs.
