<PRE>Hi Gaurav,

	
	I am not really the best person for this stuff because Miguel
significantly revamped the namespace handling since I stopped hacking on
mcs and now I don't really understand how it works in that much detail.


	From a preliminary look at your patch, it seems rather hackish and I am
not sure if it really is the best way to tackle the problem. AFAIK,
Miguel has a branch of mcs with a huge re-write of the namespace
handling code so it probably is best to try and fix it through that.
That way, the code ends up being much neater and we avoid hacks :-)



&gt;<i>     The only places where it fails is when a namespace of the same name is
</I>&gt;<i> declared after a type has already been declared. See attached file for what
</I>&gt;<i> I mean. inner_ns_fails.cs failes to compile - expected behaviour.
</I>&gt;<i> inner_ns.cs compiles - should not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     The reason is that I don't have the information about &quot;Location&quot; when
</I>&gt;<i> the namespace in error is loaded. Frankly speaking, namespace should not
</I>&gt;<i> have Location - since it can be spread to many files. So, I need to get
</I>&gt;<i> information of the previously declared non-namespace object. Currently, my
</I>&gt;<i> hack fails to do so, but still - it does *not* compile the attached files
</I>&gt;<i> (expected behaviour, only error handling is bad).
</I>
	This does solve only half the problem :-)


&gt;<i>     Let me know if I can apply the patch.
</I>
	You should wait for final word from Miguel as he is the one most in
touch with things.


	Regards,

		Ravi
