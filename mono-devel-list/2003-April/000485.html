I would say that if the thread is 2 months old, and there is nothing recent
to reply to, the act of replying is unnecessary. Simply compose a new email.
Reference the older one if you feel it may be useful - an archive URL such
as you give above would be an ideal way to do this.

This is not a problem with mailman, it is an intrinsic property of a mailing
list. A reply to a posting on a list consists of a reply to an email. If you
don't have the email, then you can't reply to it.

There are only two things that differentiate a reply from any other kind of
email: retaining the subject with a 'Re:' prefix, and the addition of an
'In-Reply-To:' header referencing the 'Message-ID:' of the original. Both of
these are simply conventions and, after a period of time, neither is
particularly useful at helping anyone to recall the thread.

I think you may be confusing a mailing list with a message board. There is
no SQL database behind this, no web front-end. The list archives are just
that - archives.

If you want to join in, just do so. There are no rules beyond normal
netiquette.
