<PRE>I believe that an HBITMAP is, by definition, a pointer to a Win32 BITMAP 
structure. Since providing this structure is a requirement of the API, 
it makes since to use it as the internal bitmap structure as well. 
Otherwise, you have to deal with copying the data between layouts and 
keeping them all in sync. This is really only important for SWF of 
course, which will most likely just pass the HBITMAP on to a native 
Win32 function.

This dependency is unfortunate, because there are much easier ways to 
work with bitmap data in C#.
