I see. It must have occured on linux, but how could one not have it
installed if one does a 'make install' in mcs? Seems the makefile(s)
take care of this automagically.  One doesn't need to do something
special, right?

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I totally agree with this. I'm still a bit stumped as to how it could
happen though (but it's not hard to stump me on things linux-ish).

&gt;<i> I'm currently very busy with other stuff, could you have a look at this ?
</I>
I'll try.
