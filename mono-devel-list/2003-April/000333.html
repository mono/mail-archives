Hi Nick,

&gt;<i> I see. It must have occured on linux, but how could one not have it

normally, this should never happen - that's why it should print an error message and not
just a warning.

&gt;<i> &gt; However, in either case, the error / warning message needs to be improved to tell people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what's actually wrong.  It'd be fine for me having it print a warning on Linux which tells
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people that it's an installation problem and that they need to compile and install the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mono.CSharp.Debugger directory.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I totally agree with this. I'm still a bit stumped as to how it could
</I>&gt;<i> happen though (but it's not hard to stump me on things linux-ish).
</I>
Ok, I can implement the &quot;ms runtime or Mono&quot; check; this can actually be done in the
symbol writer code.

&gt;<i> I'll try.

Thanks a lot.
