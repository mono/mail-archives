<PRE>I'm using mono 0.23 and XSP from CVS on a Debian Linux system.

I have an ASP.NET application (compiled using Visual Studio) that 
includes multiple projects that get compiled to multiple DLLs; the main 
project (&quot;Ivory&quot;) includes references to the other two projects, which 
are called &quot;Generated Files&quot; and &quot;NRDO library&quot; (which get compiled to 
&quot;Generated Files.dll&quot; and &quot;NRDO library.dll&quot; respectively). When I copy 
the compiled code to my Linux box and run XSP on it, I get two errors:

&quot;Source file &quot;Files.dll&quot; could not be found&quot; and &quot;Source file 
&quot;library.dll&quot; could not be found&quot;.

Obviously either Mono or xsp is failing to correctly handle the 
reference to a filename that contains a space.

I'm going to try to workaround this by compiling to a different 
filename, but I thought you guys might be interested in the bug, and it 
would be nice to be able to run my code unmodified, anyway.

Thanks,
Stuart.
