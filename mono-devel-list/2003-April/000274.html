<PRE>                                          Hi All,

  I added an experimental typed allocation facility to the
runtime. Typed
allocation means the Boehm collector knows the layout of
heap allocated
objects and known which words can hold pointers and which do
not. This
speeds up collection since fewer memory locations needs to
be examined,
and it also decreases the working set of applications since
fewer false
pointers are encountered by the collector. Typed allocation
can be turned
on by setting CREATION_SPEEDUP to 1 in metadata/object.c. 
This change speeds up corlib compilation by about 10% on my
machine.
I would appreciate if people would test this. If it works,
it can be made
the default.

                                   bye

                                         Zoltan
