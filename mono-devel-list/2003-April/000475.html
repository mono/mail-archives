<PRE>Clearly I&#146;m missing something that&#146;s butt obvious.&#160; I AM SORRY FOR BEING SO
STUPID.&#160; There, that&#146;s out of the way.
&#160;
It looks like every other person on this planet was born knowing, or
discovered miraculously how to use the Ximian list server.&#160; Except me.
&#160;
I have looked all over this site.&#160; I have looked lall over the net.&#160; The
only thing I&#146;ve found is this lame, half complete PDF file from some
University in Illinois:
<A HREF="http://staff.imsa.edu/~ckolar/mailman/mailman-userguide-0.1.pdf.">http://staff.imsa.edu/~ckolar/mailman/mailman-userguide-0.1.pdf.</A> &#160;Even more
bizarre to me was that the official Mailman website points to that doc:
<A HREF="http://www.list.org/users.html.">http://www.list.org/users.html.</A>
&#160;
If I don&#146;t receive an email for one of the articles in a Ximian list archive
(for example from <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">mono-devel-list at lists.ximian.com</A>), how can I add to the
thread?
&#160;
It must be obvious since so many different people have managed to reply to
the different threads.&#160; I simply have no idea how.
&#160;
Sorry again for the lamer post, but as you can probably tell, I&#146;m pretty
frustrated right about now.&#160; Figuring out how to use some bullsh*t
undocumented list server was not how I had planned on spending my weekend.
&#160;
Help!?
