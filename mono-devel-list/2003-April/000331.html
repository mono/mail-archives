<PRE>Hello Zoltan!

    This patch is wonderful!  So simple and elegant, I am very amazed
with the clarity of this.  

    Please, feel free to apply the patch to CVS.

&gt;<i> Also, there was some talk about emitting the list of
</I>&gt;<i> namespaces of an
</I>&gt;<i> assembly into a special resource during compilation. Is this
</I>&gt;<i> still true?
</I>&gt;<i> If it is, I could make up a patch for that...
</I>
   Currently there is some code to output a separate file (.nsc), which
we will likely keep for Windows compatibility.  Paolo has promised me a
Mono runtime call to extract the namespaces quickly without the cache.

   Having the namespace information will also help me clean up
SimpleName/MemberAccess, because currently they implement the &quot;delayed&quot;
namespace hack, which contributes largely to the complexity of those
routines.

   Also the C# generics support make these rules more complicated, so I
want to take this opportunity to clean it up.

Miguel.
