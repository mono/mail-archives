<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt; This is true, the problem is that the CreateMessageSink 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't check the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; process id. The cross appdomain channel should have the 
</I>&gt;<i> highest prio and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; also be a part of the channel list.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly, but as it must not be listed in the
</I>&gt;<i> ChannelServices.RegisteredChannels property are is the patch for that.
</I>&gt;<i> (ChannelServices-20030407.diff)
</I>
Hm, your patch has a typo, this line:

if(channel is CrossContextChannel)

Should be

if(channel is CrossAppDomainChannel) 

But otherwise it looks good.
 
&gt;<i> This was exactly this. However, the CrossAppDomainChannel.cs 
</I>&gt;<i> file is located
</I>&gt;<i> in the corlib, which does not seem to provide any way to get 
</I>&gt;<i> the current
</I>&gt;<i> process ID. I have added an internal call to the static function
</I>&gt;<i> System.Diagnostics.Process::GetPid_internal. But I don't know 
</I>&gt;<i> if I can just
</I>&gt;<i> add a reference to the existing icall function, or if I have 
</I>&gt;<i> to define a new
</I>&gt;<i> one with the appropriate name (Which would be nicer).
</I>
Hm, you need to sync this with Lluis. He has been working on this to, he has
been working on a icall for getting the process guid. It needs to be a guid
(it can't be the same as another process in another machine).

Anyway, sync up with Lluis. 

Lluis, sync up with Jerome. ;-)
 
Cheers,
 Patrik
