An MPM module is the one that defines the processing model: process based,
threaded, hybrid (multiple process each one which its own threads). That is,
how to create children processes or threads, accept connections and
distribute among the children.
The problem with a process based architecture (current one)  is that each
child will have a separate instance of Mono so some things like session
support wont work because each one of the children will have a different
state. What mod_mono needs to do is work under a threaded based MPM. that
way it can create a Mono instance that can be shared by all worker threads.
This is the way taht mod_perl for Apache 2 is implemented (it also maintains
a pool of interpreters)
