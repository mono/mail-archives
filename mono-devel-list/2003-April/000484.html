<PRE>Richard,

I don't have a problem replying to email (I'm doing it now ;o)...

My problem is in replying to older emails.

For instance, here's a message from the mono-devel-list written about 2
months before I even knew about mono:

 
<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-devel-list/2003-February/000000">http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-devel-list/2003-February/000000</A>
.html

Show me how you would reply to that thread.  There's nothing in my mailbox
to &quot;reply&quot; to, and I'm assuming it's not lurking in yours...

What's your problem Mark?

Click on the message in the thread and click reply. That's it, if you
want to reply. Now depending on what e-mail client you use different
things might happen. In evolution I right click on the mail I want to
reply to and choose &quot;Reply to List&quot;.


If you haven't subscribed then do that first.
