I commented out a few bits of my code that rely on stuff that isn't in 
Mono (DirectoryServices, Interop, and GetThumbnailImage in 
System.Drawing.Image), and recompiled the whole mess using mcs to 
filenames without spaces in. This was fun. Anyway...

Then I tried browsing to the site in xsp. The browser sat there for a 
while (presumably while xsp compiled the ascx pages) and then just 
stopped, and the terminal window I was running server.exe in showed the 
following error:

Listening on port: 8080
Root directory: /home/sballard/nrplatform
Virtual directory: /

** ERROR **: file jit.c: line 486 (mono_store_tree): assertion failed: 
(s-&gt;svt != VAL_UNKNOWN)
aborting...
Aborted

I'm going to take a wild guess that this isn't enough information to 
determine much about the cause of the error. Unfortunately I'm not 
allowed to publish the code that I'm trying to run, but is there 
anything I can do to get more useful error messages out?

Thanks,
Stuart.
