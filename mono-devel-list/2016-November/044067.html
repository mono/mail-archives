<PRE>I think there might be a misunderstanding. Miguel, correct me if I'm wrong.

After reading the blog post again, I think it talks about Mono itself
having different libraries on different platforms (i.e. the framework
assemblies). This means you wouldn't be able to take System.dll built on
Linux and run it on Windows or Mac. But this applies only to the mono
installation.

My reading of the post is that your assemblies/libraries that you
compile yourself will still be able to run on multiple platforms.

IMO not being able to take Mono assemblies and put them on another
platform wouldn't be to much of a problem. It's nice to have, but
already we're not able to copy the runtime and unmanaged libraries from
one platform to the other, so additionally not being able to copy the
managed assemblies doesn't seem to drastic of a change.

It would be different if we wouldn't be able to compile a library
(that's not part of mono) and use that on different platforms. That
would eliminate one of the big advantages of .NET. But I don't think the
blog post talks about that.

</I>&gt;<i> Well, *they* could switch. My own platform specific libraries do

</I>&gt;<i> I have two libraries I maintain that support both .NET Framework and 
</I>&gt;<i> .NET Micro Framework (and Arduino -- libraries for embedded devices), 
</I>&gt;<i> and due to how Microsoft ended up putting things in different

</I>&gt;<i> are missing this overload or that. I have to have separate solution 
</I>&gt;<i> files. In the future I'll probably just ditch Micro Framework support. 
</I>&gt;<i> It's terrible, a hassle to maintain, and even more of a hassle to 
</I>&gt;<i> support, debug and test.
