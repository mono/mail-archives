<PRE>Hi Rodrigo,

Yes, thanks for pointing that out. I wasn't very clear in my post when I
said the &quot;latest&quot; Mono. I pulled Mono from master, built it, and tried to
get BoringTLS to work. I've actually pulled and built multiple times since
Miguel's announcement on his blog back in September. If I do not set &quot;btls&quot;
as the provider, it defaults to Legacy. If I set &quot;btls&quot; it throws an
exception that I believe means it cannot find BoringSSL on my system. I
believe this means that building Mono does not build Boring itself, and that
I need to build it. That part is unclear to me and I've not found
documentation yet (early days I'm sure) to give me direction.

Thanks much,

Guerry
