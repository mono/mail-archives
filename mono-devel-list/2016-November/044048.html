<PRE>Mono will support UWP, mostly as a side-effect of other work we are doing, but we do not have a timeline for that.

Mono.Data.Sqlite is a binding that you could attempt to support on your own in UWP without the Mono team.

Hi,

We are planning to use Mono Sqlite library in our UWP platform.
Can you please provide your thoughts on the below mail so that we could plan our product roadmap accordingly?

Subject: Regarding Mono.Data.Sqlite library support for UWP applications.

Hi,

I am part of Schneider Electric technical team . We are using “Mono.Data.Sqlite” library (along with Xamarin) in our Android application.
We are currently extending our application to support UWP platform and are facing issues with using “Mono Sqlite” library in UWP, mostly around System.Data API incompatibilities.

We would like to know whether there is any Mono project already released/in pipeline to support UWP.
If not, can we actively contribute to that effort by forking in our changes?

Please let us know your plans in this regard.

Regards
Mahalingam V
