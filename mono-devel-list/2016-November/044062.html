<PRE>Well, *they* could switch. My own platform specific libraries do 
detection. Anything else just ends up with lots of vaguely shareable, 
similar, but unshared code. In practice what it means is a developer is 
going to forget to package anything but the Windows version. That may be 
the idea. Making the library *just work*, without the developer having 
to worry about platforms, is best.

I have two libraries I maintain that support both .NET Framework and 
.NET Micro Framework (and Arduino -- libraries for embedded devices), 
and due to how Microsoft ended up putting things in different 
assemblies, even the same classes, it's a cluttered #ifdef mess. Some 
are missing this overload or that. I have to have separate solution 
files. In the future I'll probably just ditch Micro Framework support. 
It's terrible, a hassle to maintain, and even more of a hassle to 
support, debug and test.

It's probably better to pull Microsoft out of the mud as best as 
possible instead of sinking with them.
