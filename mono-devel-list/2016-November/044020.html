Subject: Regarding Mono.Data.Sqlite library support for UWP applications.

Hi,

I am part of Schneider Electric technical team . We are using &quot;Mono.Data.Sqlite&quot; library (along with Xamarin) in our Android application.
We are currently extending our application to support UWP platform and are facing issues with using &quot;Mono Sqlite&quot; library in UWP, mostly around System.Data API incompatibilities.

We would like to know whether there is any Mono project already released/in pipeline to support UWP.
If not, can we actively contribute to that effort by forking in our changes?

Please let us know your plans in this regard.

Regards
Mahalingam V
