<PRE>BoringTLS support in mono has not shipped anywhere.

Right now you need to build from source to get access to it.

</I>&gt;<i> Miguel and others have been very helpful, but no combination of things I've

</I>&gt;<i> TLS was available in the latest Mono bits, and so I shifted gears.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I built Mono and could see lots of references to Boring TLS. I built my
</I>&gt;<i> Mono
</I>&gt;<i> project (not Xamarin.Mac) using the latest Mono and targeting .NET
</I>&gt;<i> Framework
</I>&gt;<i> 4.6, and ran it using the same. No matter what I did, I could only get the
</I>&gt;<i> Legacy TLS provider, or if I specified &quot;btls&quot; it would fail with an
</I>&gt;<i> exception because Boring SSL was not found. I could not find any docs about
</I>&gt;<i> whether I need to build/install Boring separately or if the bundled copy in
</I>&gt;<i> Mono was supposed to get built. Is the Mono Boring TLS stuff only for
</I>&gt;<i> Android?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I next read again about Apple TLS and Xamarin.Mac. I made a new Xamarin.Mac
</I>&gt;<i> project and ported my code to it. I found that Owin and other packages were
</I>&gt;<i> not available on Nuget for Xamarin.Mac Mobile Framework&quot; but I had success
</I>&gt;<i> with Xamarin.Mac .NET 4.5 Framework. However, the Apple TLS Provider does
</I>&gt;<i> not appear available and will not load. I only get the Legacy Provider.
</I>&gt;<i> Does
</I>&gt;<i> the Apple TLS Provider only work with Xamarin.Mac Mobile Framework?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I feel like I'm in a twisty maze of passages all alike.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there a document somewhere that points up which TLS options are
</I>&gt;<i> available
</I>&gt;<i> for which frameworks?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Much thanks in advance,
