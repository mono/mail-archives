<PRE>Hi Edward,

You're right, I've not done a sample project this time around. For the prior
attempts, another user posted a project that duplicated my exact problems
with the Legacy provider. I'll work today on sample projects that duplicate
the issue, and include actual but throw-away certs.

This project does run on windows and it been running on windows with the
same exact certificate for several months. The certificate code is almost
identical between platforms except for the port-binding code. The
port-binding code produces exactly the same content that manually setting up
the binding using the command line tools does.

Thanks much,

Guerry
