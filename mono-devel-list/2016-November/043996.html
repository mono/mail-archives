<PRE>Hi,

I've posted before about this, but I've been away trying new approaches
which also did not work. I'm back to see if my new approaches have any
answers. My project is at a complete stand still and has been for several
months.

I have a OS X console app that is hosting Owin as a web service and SignalR.
I need TLS 1.2 to work serving a certificate bound to a port on the Mac, as
well as for HTTP clients used in the service. The Mono Legacy TLS 1.0
Provider does not work, particularly with our certificate, which is
currently generated by LetsEncrypt, and which I believe is only authentic
for TLS 1.1 and 1.2. I guess I should try a certificate with TLS 1.0
support?

Miguel and others have been very helpful, but no combination of things I've
tried up through last month worked. Then came the announcement that Boring
TLS was available in the latest Mono bits, and so I shifted gears. 

I built Mono and could see lots of references to Boring TLS. I built my Mono
project (not Xamarin.Mac) using the latest Mono and targeting .NET Framework
4.6, and ran it using the same. No matter what I did, I could only get the
Legacy TLS provider, or if I specified &quot;btls&quot; it would fail with an
exception because Boring SSL was not found. I could not find any docs about
whether I need to build/install Boring separately or if the bundled copy in
Mono was supposed to get built. Is the Mono Boring TLS stuff only for
Android?

I next read again about Apple TLS and Xamarin.Mac. I made a new Xamarin.Mac
project and ported my code to it. I found that Owin and other packages were
not available on Nuget for Xamarin.Mac Mobile Framework&quot; but I had success
with Xamarin.Mac .NET 4.5 Framework. However, the Apple TLS Provider does
not appear available and will not load. I only get the Legacy Provider. Does
the Apple TLS Provider only work with Xamarin.Mac Mobile Framework?

I feel like I'm in a twisty maze of passages all alike.

Is there a document somewhere that points up which TLS options are available
for which frameworks?

Much thanks in advance,

Guerry
