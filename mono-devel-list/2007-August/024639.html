<PRE>Hey,

Well, it's difficult, but if it's possible to read the object model
from the raw bytes, it should also be possible to write it back.

&gt;<i> I agree that cecil should expose an interface to load an assembly as
</I>&gt;<i> 'Read Only', where the optimizations should be activated, and by that
</I>&gt;<i> save the worrying of the changes to the assembly writing part.
</I>&gt;<i> I really like the idea that the object model will access the raw tables
</I>&gt;<i> directly and in lazy way.
</I>&gt;<i> This idea will work only if the access to the raw table will be fast,
</I>&gt;<i> and in order to do so, the code needs to build more relations between
</I>&gt;<i> these tables.
</I>&gt;<i> We can take the CustomAttributes table for example, each raw at this
</I>&gt;<i> table has the 'RID' of the owner element, and the TokenType of the
</I>&gt;<i> owner, and in order for a 'Field', for example, to load its
</I>&gt;<i> CustomAttibutes lazily, it needs that opposite relation, from its 'RID'
</I>&gt;<i> to its CustomAttributes, will exist.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I basically want to suggest the following:
</I>&gt;<i> The methods of the ReflectionReader will be changed, and instead of
</I>&gt;<i> building an object model, they will only build the desired relations
</I>&gt;<i> between elements (Methods-&gt;Types, Fields-&gt;Constants,
</I>&gt;<i> Fields-&gt;InitialValues ...)
</I>
And how do you plan to represent those relations?

&gt;<i> The higher object model classes (TypeDefinition, MethodDefinition,
</I>&gt;<i> FieldDefinition ...), will have their properties access lazily those
</I>&gt;<i> built relations in order to fetch the data on first access.
</I>&gt;<i> My favorite solution is to write a 'ReadOnlyReflectionReader' that will
</I>&gt;<i> contain the above changes, and leave the current implementation as is
</I>&gt;<i> for writing purposes.
</I>&gt;<i> I think we should also consider removing the 'sealed' modifier from the
</I>&gt;<i> higher level object model classes (like TypeDefinition, MethodDefinition
</I>&gt;<i> ...), by that give the used ReflectionReader full control over the
</I>&gt;<i> object model implementation, building its own read-only one.
</I>
Another concern I have is Cecil's size. It's already ~360k, and I'd
like to avoid bloating it.

&gt;<i> Now is a good time for us to start such a process, and I would really
</I>&gt;<i> want to push things forward.
</I>
I'll create a branch for Cecil so we can experiment.

&gt;<i> What do you think about the suggestion?
</I>&gt;<i> If you think about major issues that the above solution will encounter,
</I>&gt;<i> I would be happy to hear about them.
</I>
I need to think more about the implications, but be sure there will be
dragons :)
