<PRE>Jonathan , I am not sure if IKVM would do . Since I want to compile my
project on linux once and for all and be able to deploy to Windows machines
by only XCOPY.

Johannes, Filehelper looks promising. There are some guys in the forums
reporting success with mono however I am not sure if they tried the excel
support. I must try this anyway. I will inform you about the results once I
did.

Thanks for all your answers. They were very helpful to me.
