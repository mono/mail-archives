<PRE>Hello,

i'm new to this list cause i have a problem compiling mono on my
embedded linux and can't find any useful hints to my problem on the web.
I compiled and installed bison, pkg-config and glib 2.4.8 and configured
mono successfully.
When running make, compilation fails with the below error message:


exceptions-ppc.c:486: warning: unused variable `p'
exceptions-ppc.c:506: warning: `offset' might be used uninitialized in this
function
exceptions-ppc.c:590: warning: visibility attribute not supported in this

make[4]: *** [exceptions-ppc.lo] Error 1

make[1]: Leaving directory `/tmp/mono-1.2.4'
make: *** [all] Error 2

I found only 3 hits with google which gave me no solution for that problem.
Does anyone can help me out with that problem? Is it ppc specific?

Further, if there is a solution to this problem i got another one: Is it
possible to build mono from the sources without having a mono installation?
The readme says this should be possible if it's an official release (which
1.2.4 i think is?) and not a snapshot.
Problem is: I'm running on a ppc with glibc 2.3.1 and i can't find any
binary distribution compiled against it. So do i may run into the chicken
egg problem?

regards
jOe
