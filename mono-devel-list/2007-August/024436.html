you read of this useless fine print is another second off your life. Don't
you have other things to do? Is your life so empty that you honestly can't
think of a better way to spend these moments? Or are you so impressed with
authority that you give respect and credence to all that claim it? Do you
read everything you're supposed to read? Do you think every thing you're
supposed to think? Buy what you're told to want? Get out of your apartment.

claim your humanity you will become a statistic. You have been warned - Onur
