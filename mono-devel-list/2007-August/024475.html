<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt; Basically the idea, would be to add another of the internal

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; appropriate mechanism to translate the descriptions

</I>
I was short on details, but yes, the idea is to publish a very small
interface, whose the app would inject the translation mechanism of
choice, while I would still provide those two I've mentioned, probably
as a pair of libraries in the the same managed Commons family.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've transfered the development of new GetOptions features to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Commons.GetOptions (see
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://monoblog.blogspot.com/2007/01/commonsgetoptions-sucessor-to.html">http://monoblog.blogspot.com/2007/01/commonsgetoptions-sucessor-to.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; part of my managed Commons initiative) but I must confess
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that I hadn't have alloted any time beyond the initial
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; renaming/refactoring of the code, and never published it in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; any repository (I intended to do so as part of one of my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; projects at sourceforge, but I'm not sure anymore that it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be best place). See now I've chosen the Burroughs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; phrase to put in my signature below.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That could be my sig, as well. :-(
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anyway, if you are interested, I can restart working on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Commons.GetOptions, and package it in its own release and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; versioning policy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm interested - either as Commons.GetOptions or doing a
</I>&gt;<i> (hopefully temporary) fork as NUnit.GetOptions. That way,
</I>&gt;<i> NUnit itself could use it and it would be available for the
</I>&gt;<i> use of the series of small utilities I'm starting to publish.
</I>
I'll try to publish Commons.GetOptions initial release (it already
works, basically as Mono.GetOptions did), over the weekend and then
you can choose if you fork or if you'd like to contribute to it, and
package with nunit. The license is still very permissive, so I hope
you can use it either way and be satisfied.


Thanks for the interest,
