<PRE>Hello Onur,

 

yes, my public server runs linux. ;-) I have deleted TodoItems.xsd and the
specified line in ToolScriptManager.skin, too.

I have made some more modifications. If you are interested, I can give a
report, but this will take a while.

 

Jens

 

 

Jens thanks for the reply.

- Does your public server runs linux ?  I mean the url you have given, Does
it  run on Mono ?

- As a final resort I've deleted the TodoItems.xsd. Now that the site runs
on my local. I also have to delete the line : 

&lt;ajaxToolkit:ToolkitScriptManager runat=&quot;server&quot;
CombineScriptsHandlerUrl=&quot;~/CombineScriptsHandler.ashx&quot; /&gt;

from App_Themes/SampleSiteTheme/ToolScriptManager.skin.

According to my knowledge we must define the tag prefixes in skin files.
However this practice is not applied here 

- After these modifications I am able to run the Sample Site. But no AJAX no
DHTML. And I can run ASP.NET Ajax applications without control toolkit.
System.Web.Extensions is in gac (since I use mono from svn this is by
default) 

Any ideas ?

Just for help. =) It is an internal compilation error of the attached file
&quot;TodoItems.xsd&quot;. This file is located in the

&quot;AppCode&quot;-Directory of the sample web site. 

 

BTW: I have uploaded the sample web site to my public server, maybe this is
helpful for somebody. <A HREF="http://ajaxtoolkit.tophostingteam.de/">http://ajaxtoolkit.tophostingteam.de/</A>

Hello after successfully running  &lt;<A HREF="http://ASP.NET">http://ASP.NET</A>&gt; ASP.NET ajax. I tried the
control kit with latest svn of mono runtime. However it does not seem to
work.

When I try the sample web site coming with the no source package I am
getting the following error: 

/terror CS0542: `TodoItems.TodoItems': member names cannot be the same as
their enclosing type

 protected TodoItems(System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationInfo info,
System.Runtime.Serialization.StreamingContext ctx) {






Line 33:         // TODO: implement






Line 34:         throw new 
System.NotImplementedException();






Line 35:     }






Line 36:     






Line 37:     public virtual TodoItemsDataTable TodoItems {






Line 38:         get {






Line 39:             return this.__tableTodoItems;







Line 40:         }






Line 41:     }




Also compiling the source code gives me bunch of errors like
System.Web.Resource not found etc...

Onur
