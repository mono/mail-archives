<PRE>Hello Konstantin,

 

&gt;&gt;<i> In the same time I see that Jens Wurster had successfully run entire
</I>Toolkit sample with mono.

 

No, that's not true.

 

These controls are not completely running at the moment:

 

AlwaysVisibleControl, AutoComplete, CascadingDropDown, DynamicPopulate,
FilteredTextBox, HoverMenu, MaskedEdit,

NumericUpDown, Rating, ReorderList, SlideShow and ValidatorCallout

 

And for the Accordion-Control I have made some changes in
TemplateControlComplier.cs.

 

Sample Code:

 

&lt;ajaxToolkit:Accordion ID=&quot;Accordion1&quot; TransitionDuration=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;

 

Error: The TargetControlID . does not exist.

 

In this case it is very important that the ID-Attribute will be parsed
first. I don't know why the order of the specified attributes will not be
respected by mono. So I modified the TemplateControlComplier.cs to proccess
the ID-Attribute everytime at first, like SkinID.

 

Regards

Jens

 

 

Ok, now I see that you are running a Toolkit sample web site.

I would suggest not running such a complex application from the beginning,
since it's hard to track arising problems, but start with something simple.

 

In the same time I see that Jens Wurster had successfully run entire Toolkit
sample with mono.

 

Regards,

Konstantin Triger

Hello Konstantin

 

&gt;<i>According to what you're saying, the web site comes without source files
</I>and toolkit should be compiled as a separate dll and referenced &gt;from the
web site (put to the bin folder / GAC).

 

This is not quite true. As you know although the toolkit must be compiled as
a seperate dll and put into bin/GAC , the same thing is not compulsory for
the web site. In such a case the web server (XSP or IIS) would compile the
source code on the fly (and put the dll to a temporary folder). In my case
this is what happens. The source code I have posted is from the generated
source code by the XSP in order to compile the website. And as a matter of
fact that source code resides in temporary folder in my system, not anywhere
in the sample project. 

 

I hope this would help to understand what goes wrong.

Subject: Re: [Mono-dev] System.Web.Extension

 

Hello after successfully running ASP.NET ajax. I tried the control kit with
latest svn of mono runtime. However it does not seem to work.

When I try the sample web site coming with the no source package I am
getting the following error: 

/terror CS0542: `TodoItems.TodoItems': member names cannot be the same as
their enclosing type

 protected TodoItems(System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationInfo info,
System.Runtime.Serialization.StreamingContext ctx) {













 
Line 33:         // TODO: implement













 
Line 34:         throw new 
System.NotImplementedException();













 
Line 35:     }













 
Line 36:     













 
Line 37:     public virtual TodoItemsDataTable TodoItems {













 
Line 38:         get {













 
Line 39:             return this.__tableTodoItems;














 
Line 40:         }













 
Line 41:     }




Also compiling the source code gives me bunch of errors like
System.Web.Resource not found etc...
