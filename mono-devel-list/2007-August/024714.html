I am using the standard OpenEmbedded ARM EABI toolchain and I am not
seeing this issue on the NEO1973 phone (Samsung ARM SOC), or a Xscale
platform.  Both kernel configs include:

CONFIG_AEABI=y
CONFIG_OABI_COMPAT=y

As I understand it, floating point is emulated at the library level,
and not in the kernel with this setup.

&gt;<i> i'm very new to kernel building and am wondering if there could be another

</I>&gt;<i> oabi compatibility, or am i misunderstanding somthing? (or perhaps just
</I>&gt;<i> doing something wrong)
</I>
Are you building the mono-1.2.5pre5 package?  I never did find a
solution to the ARM floating point issues with 1.2.4.

&gt;<i> also, i don't have a neo1973 yet, but i thought there was mention of getting
</I>&gt;<i> mono working
</I>&gt;<i> on an xscale processor with eabi support, can anyone out there with such
</I>&gt;<i> experience elaborate
</I>&gt;<i> on their details? (what device?)
</I>
Yes, I have mono running on a Xscale platform.

&gt;<i> thanks again for the recipe and i'm looking forward to doing what i can to
</I>&gt;<i> help out... eventually
</I>&gt;<i> i'd like to contribute to getting libgdiplus supported (i have some
</I>&gt;<i> primitave bb recipes) as well
</I>&gt;<i> as bluetooth connectivity, something like wrappers around bluez
</I>&gt;<i> functionality with an API

Excellent!   Thomas Kunze created the original mono recipes.
