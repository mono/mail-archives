<PRE>Hi all,

As you may know we, at mainsoft, use cecil library.

We have made some analysis for the performance and found that loading
assemblies with cecil has a lot of memory consuming impact.

Investigating this thing more had shown that the code creates a full
object model on top of the assembly row tables.

We understand that for writing/creating assembly using cecil , building
a full object model  might be unavoidable, but for a lot of users that
only wants to read an assembly, and event interested only in part of the
assembly it might be not necessary.

We believe that improving this area will give theses users a better
experience that will be realized in less memory consumption and faster
loading time.

Nowadays, we are looking for ways to improve cecil in this area.

I will be happy to know what you think, and whether you have had
thoughts about this issue.

Any thoughts, suggestions and questions are welcome.

 

Regares, 

Roei Erez
