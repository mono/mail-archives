<PRE>Hello Onur,

     I liked your How To, and I was wondering if you would mind taking
this HOW-TO one step further.   Let me explain.

     You mention that it would be nice if MonoDevelop would have better
support for partial classes and Code Behind (or Code-Beside, or
Code-something).  Am assuming you are the same person that was
discussing this on IRC today.

      Would you mind writing a specification of what you envision
MonoDevelop should do?    If we had a specification that describes what
the feature should look like and what MonoDevelop should expose it has
higher chances of being implemented.

Miguel.

</PRE>
