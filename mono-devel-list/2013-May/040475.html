</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a representative of one of the aforementioned companies who is trying to

</I>&gt;<i> enterprises, perhaps we could become a larger part of the overall revenue
</I>&gt;<i> stream and our bugs would get better prioritization.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don&#8217;t think this would be bad for the project, since the classes our

</I>&gt;<i> Sockets, Threads, collections, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The bugs we&#8217;ve experienced are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Socket.Send and Socket.BeginSend in blocking mode returning without
</I>&gt;<i> finishing the entire send, which we had to fix in our code by not using
</I>&gt;<i> async and looping on blocking Send() until the entire send is actually
</I>&gt;<i> complete.  Work that by spec should be done by Send and BeginSend.  It
</I>&gt;<i> works, but it&#8217;s Mono-specific and/or Linux-specific hacks that aren&#8217;t needed
</I>&gt;<i> on Windows+CLR.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mono&#8217;s BlockingCollection&lt;T&gt; performance as a producer consumer queue for a
</I>&gt;<i> pool of threads is really really bad.  As the number of threads waiting on
</I>&gt;<i> the collection goes up, the thrashing rapidly gets out of control.  There is
</I>&gt;<i> no such issue on Windows+CLR.  I ended up copying Mono&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> BlockingCollection.cs, copying it into my project as
</I>&gt;<i> MonoBlockingCollection.cs and rewriting parts of it to make the performance
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable.  We finally changed the design of the service so we could remove
</I>&gt;<i> the custom class, and it works fine that way, but our goal is to minimize or
</I>&gt;<i> eliminate any Mono specific changes to our code because we aren&#8217;t yet
</I>&gt;<i> convinced that the project considers service applications a first class
</I>&gt;<i> consumer of the platform.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have to choose between running Boehm GC and hitting too many roots
</I>&gt;<i> failures, or running sgen and getting crashes due to bugs.  We are
</I>&gt;<i> constantly testing running our application on different nodes in either mode
</I>&gt;<i> in the hopes that one will prove more stability than the other.  We have
</I>&gt;<i> also had to modify our code significantly in ways that seem less likely to
</I>&gt;<i> reproduce either crash.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now we are certainly a fault here too.  The send bug is reported in bug
</I>&gt;<i> 3844, but we don&#8217;t have a test case that reproduces it.  It&#8217;s difficult to
</I>&gt;<i> reproduce, because it happens under load, in a multithreaded socket server.
</I>&gt;<i> But it seems like it would be very easy to add a check if we&#8217;re in blocking
</I>&gt;<i> mode and if Send doesn&#8217;t honor the spec, loop until we&#8217;re done sending so
</I>&gt;<i> that consumers get expected behavior.  I should write that patch and submit
</I>&gt;<i> it.  I&#8217;m pretty sure I haven&#8217;t written a bug for the BlockingCollection&lt;T&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> performance issue, nor have I submitted my improved version.  I&#8217;m capable of
</I>&gt;<i> contributing to Mono, and I should do so since it&#8217;s relevant to my interests
</I>&gt;<i> and business.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That being said, giving companies with different business models a way to
</I>&gt;<i> contribute to the bottom line and thus get more attention for their needs
</I>&gt;<i> seems like it would help everyone.  Considering what Mono saves us on
</I>&gt;<i> administrative overhead and licensing costs, there&#8217;s no reason my business
</I>&gt;<i> and other businesses wouldn&#8217;t consider such a support agreement if it had
</I>&gt;<i> value.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I love this project, and want to see it succeed in more than just mobile.
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!

</I>&gt;<i> So we have reproduced bugs even with suggestions given (and documented)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How do we move forward from this point? We have shown in the past that we
</I>&gt;<i> don't mind bounties but we are at a point of giving up and saying mono is

</I>&gt;<i> who wants to build a tcp server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How can we move forward? We have provided failing cases. We have provided a

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
