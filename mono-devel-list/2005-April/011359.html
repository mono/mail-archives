<PRE>&gt;<i> THANK YOU!  I'll start adding these patches to my FreeBSD Mono port
</I>&gt;<i> tonight or tomorrow.  I have a Mono 1.1.x port (lang/mono-devel) sitting
</I>&gt;<i> in my CVS for leading up to the switch over to Mono 1.2 in the FreeBSD
</I>&gt;<i> ports tree.  Feel free to take a look at the rest of the patches still
</I>&gt;<i> in CVS here: 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/cvs/cvsbrowse.php/bsd-sharp/FreeBSD-ports/lang/mono-devel/files/">http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/cvs/cvsbrowse.php/bsd-sharp/FreeBSD-ports/lang/mono-devel/files/</A>
</I> 

And thank you for those ports patches.  A couple of them were part of
the 1.0.6 port, and included in my patch - most importantly the switch
from SIGUSR1/2 to STOP/CONT.  The rest, along with a few other things
I have here, but did not submit, are needed to get a clean end-to-end
configure and build on an svn checkout.  I think a more generic
solution for the lack of alloca.h and a working ieeefp.h, among
others, should be whipped up before sending here to the list, but I'd
like to see the source build without ports patches someday.

As mentioned in my other reply, the threads stuff, and signaling seems
very up-in-the-air right now for *bsd*, but a working port at 1.2
seems a good goal to me, perhaps I can help further in the effort.
