<PRE>Hmm.. I was able to recompile the Mono Classes with the only difference being using my own Boehm-GC package, the 6.4 version, as opposed to the included version [which is 6.1 or 6.3 I believe].  I was also able to compile MonoDevelop [which also ran into the strange stack-overflow during compile].
What gives?

About the GC issue, has there been any progress with the more precise ones, like IBM ORP [if I got that right]?  It's be nice to have a better GC so that memory could be compacted and also so some GC issues [like whatever caused the stack overflow.. dont really see how the GC did it.. but go figure].  Perhaps it might even help out with the GTK issues with the Null ptrs at random.
