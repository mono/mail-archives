Top-posting should not be used: it usually just means that people using
them don't know how to use the arrow keys on their keyboard.
Usually the same people don't delete the useless parts of the quoted
message in the reply, too. I guess they didn't learn about the backspace
key either (or the other key combinations to delete lines etc:-)

&gt;<i> I see HTML messages etc. And
</I>
HTML messages should not be used either (especially those that are not
even tagged correctly with the mime type and don't have the text-only
copy). I don't read HTML-only emails at all, for example (not because I
can't, but the chance of them having useful content is too near 0).

&gt;<i> actually what bothers me, is that in  the archives there are some
</I>&gt;<i> messages, in which every line ends with &quot; =&quot;. What is this?
</I>
Any example link? It may be an issue of the mail archive sw that doesn't
decode quoted-printable or some mail client that doesn't send it
correctly.

&gt;<i> Also, what is the policy about replaying? To the list? Private? I
</I>&gt;<i> already posted a question and received both a private answer and
</I>&gt;<i> another one in the list. Do we have to keep the list volume low, and
</I>&gt;<i> skip some answers to the list?
</I>
The replies should go to the list unless they are off-topic and personal
so everyone can read and learn from the answers. It seems a few
people don't know how to send a reply to the list, so they will mail
privately (they use the reply to author instead of the reply to list
command in their email clients).
