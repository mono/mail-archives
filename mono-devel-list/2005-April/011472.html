<PRE>...I am settling on this paper:

<A HREF="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/chow96effective.html">http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/chow96effective.html</A>

It deals exactly with the problems I was trying to solve,
and the solution looks very much like what I was trying to do...
luckily they did the analysis for me :-)

Basically, it describes an extended SSA form (HSSA) that deals
with indirect load/stores and aliasing.

By the way, actually the solution has always been in front of me:
the SSAPRE guys used HSSA and not SSA in their implementation, so
they did all their benchmarks using HSSA.
In fact one of the SSAPRE paper authors is also the author of the
HSSA paper... so, in retrospect, the fact that SSAPRE is not so
powerful when using plain SSA should have been expected :-(

The only thing I don't really understand is why they did not base
SSAPRE directly on GVN, since HSSA uses GVN internally...
Anyway, I'll consider the issue studying the paper better.

I posted this so that if anybody has major objections he can tell
me before I go too far.

Ciao,
  Massi
