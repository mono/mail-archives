So I did a bit of profiling with this, both using valgrind and my
graphical heap profiler. In unmanaged land, it seems like there are
leaks in the resources of the MonoImage. Since the MonoDynamicImage is a
gc'd object, could a finalizer free up resources?

In managed land, the main issue is that we keep around the ILGenerator
from the method builder. Setting the ilgenerator to null will likely
solve the worst of the managed problems, as the gc will be able to clean
up after itself.

I tried a simple test on the Windows machine here, and they clearly leak
as well. I did not bother to test which runtime was leaking more, nor
did I look at the leaks on msft with the clrprofiler.
