I'm not sure there is a need to optimize accesses to those variables. The bigger
problem is that currently all variables which are used in bblocks reachable from
catch blocks are also marked volatile, since the liveness info is not correctly
computed for them because of the CFG problems with catch blocks.

</I>&gt;<i> The flag will not be set, so the optimizations relying on it to
