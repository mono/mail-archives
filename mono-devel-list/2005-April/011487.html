Miguel told me that the performance issue will appear when, say,
thousands of sockets have to be passed to/from kernel/user space.

I removed the old (not enabled by default) code that used aio_* and
cleaned up everything related to AIO for sockets. Right now it's much
simpler to plug aio_* as I'm not trying to mimic windows API functions
and I already delat with the caveats before so this means that once
other issues with higher priorities get out of my TODO list, aio_* will
be added and used when available and working.
