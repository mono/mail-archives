Internal calls arguments don't get marshaled.

[1] Either you have not looked at the code we have now or you're telling
us what our code does ;-).

That 1) and 3) is what we do know, but instead of 2) we have a thread
doint select/poll or epoll_wait.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So... for the event handling system using event_dispatch, I would

</I>&gt;<i> depending on what kind it is, spawn a threadpool thread for the user

</I>
See [1] above. But we have a separate threadpool for IO.

[...]
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This system might also be good to push into file IO... that still

</I>
No, it doesn't, but it's very simple to add support for this (&lt; 20 lines
s of code with comments :-).

Given that currently we do select/poll on all systems if nothing else is
available or use epoll if it's there and kqueue support will be added
sometime soon, we will be lacking support for linux 2.4 RT signal style
and /dev/poll (oh, and Windows(tm) IOCP), but hopefully someone will
provide patches for those...
