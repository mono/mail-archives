<PRE>Inside MonoInst there are these four fields:

	/* used by the register allocator */
	gint32 dreg, sreg1, sreg2, unused;

As the comment says, they are used by the register allocator.
I verified it, and it seems to me that before the decompose
pass they are never touched.

For various reasons, when extending the SSA construction pass
to take into account also the store operations performed
through pointers, I'd need some integer field in MonoInst.
This need is likely to go away with the new linear IR, but for
now I see no other way to handle &quot;homeless values&quot; in this kind
of analysis.

Would it be OK if I use those unused fields?
Of course I would mask this with appropriate #defines, so that
the code would be readable and look clean anyway.
After SSA destruction those fields would be unused again.

Ciao,
  Massi
