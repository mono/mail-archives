<PRE>Hello Boris,

&gt;<i> I understand that use of machine.config or app.config is far from ideal,
</I>&gt;<i> but at least it can provide us with a basic solution.
</I>
When things gets too complicated people quit. I don't think many people are
gonna be runned the LDAP tests but I wouldn't want to discourage anyone. So
the easier the better ;-)

Why don't keep the environment variable (very simple) and point it to a
configuration file (XML or plain ASCII) ?

That would mean:

* that, by default, all non-network tests in System.DirectoryServices.dll
will be executed (here I'm thinking about the few permissions tests already
present _and_ future CAS tests);

* it would be possible to check into SVN a configuration sample file that
any user can copy (so it won't get in conflict with SVN) and edit;

* it would be possible to have multiple configuration files, e.g. if you
want to test against different LDAP servers (machine or software);

* all configuration could be done in a single place whatever the
runtime/version you are using.

&gt;<i> Do you think there is a better way to provide a &quot;default&quot; behavior,
</I>&gt;<i> either at DirectoryServices or Ldap level, such that it will be easily
</I>&gt;<i> configured for each client application?
</I>&gt;<i> The trivial solution - default is &quot;<A HREF="LDAP://localhost:389&quot;,">LDAP://localhost:389&quot;,</A> does not looks
</I>&gt;<i> satisfactory and, in addition, does not provides a solution for base dsn.
</I>
Without a valid configuration file I would simply ignore all tests
(requiring a server). This is similar to what I'm doing for the CAS tests.
If someone doesn't exclude them (default for &quot;make run-test&quot;) and doesn't
supply --security to the mono runtime, then they are all ignore (and nicely
nunit still shows them as ignored when they aren't excluded).
