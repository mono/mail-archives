<PRE>Hello Brian,

&gt;<i> I've been working on integrating the SslServerStream with XSP and ran
</I>&gt;<i> across what appears to be a bug in the SslCipherSuite class. I'm new
</I>&gt;<i> to the inner workings of SSL, so please forgive any misstatements.
</I>
Nice! I'm glad someone took the challenge to SSL enabled XSP :-)
 
&gt;<i> Once I had the SslServerStream hooked into the XSP server, it wasn't
</I>&gt;<i> working properly...GETs would work, but POST-backs wouldn't. (On
</I>&gt;<i> Firefox &amp; IE)  After much debugging, I think I've found the answer.
</I>&gt;<i> The ComputeClientRecordMAC function that calculated the hash for each
</I>&gt;<i> fragment coming from the client (and comparing it to the hash provided
</I>&gt;<i> by the client)...was using the wrong sequence #.  As I understand it,
</I>&gt;<i> a request is broken into multiple fragments, and a sequence # is
</I>&gt;<i> incremented for each fragment.  Since the wrong sequence # was being
</I>&gt;<i> used, the hashes for requests with more than one fragment were
</I>&gt;<i> invalid.  Since POSTs have more data, they were being broken into
</I>&gt;<i> multiple fragments.
</I>
Make sense to me. As you may have guessed the server side code is much 
less tested than the client side - mainly due to the lack of servers
using the code. Hopefully this will change.

&gt;<i> Once I applied this simple patch (attached), XSP worked nicely with
</I>&gt;<i> both browsers in SSL mode.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please let me know if this patch can be committed.
</I>
If Carlos is also ok on the patch then it will be committed shortly.

Thanks

Sebastien Pouliot
