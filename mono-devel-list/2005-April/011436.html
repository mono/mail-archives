<PRE>Hello Brian,

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 1) HTTPS support.  I successfully integrated the Mono.Security
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Without much thinking, I'd like this to be disabled by default and have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and option (--https?) to enable HTTPS support.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We'd also need options to specify the cert file, private key file, and
</I>&gt;<i> optionally the private key password.  Carlos or Sebastien may have
</I>&gt;<i> more input on what kinds of options we should support for loading
</I>&gt;<i> these.
</I>
For testing purpose you may want an option to specify (well restrict) the
supported protocol - i.e. SSLv3 or TLSv1
(Mono.Security.Protocol.Tls.SecurityProtocolType SecurityProtocol), the
default being accepting both types of clients.

Another &quot;nice&quot; feature would be to restrict the cryptographic algorithms
that can be used. By default SSL/TLS negotiate the &quot;best&quot; cipher suite based
on what the server and client both support. In real-life you may want to:
* remove algorithm too costly (performance wise) to support more clients,
e.g. AES 256 bits;
* remove weak algorithms, e.g. the 40/56/64 bits DES/RC2; and
* export restrictions may only allow someone to use the weak algorithms
anyway;
But there is no public API to do so (reflection would be required).

Then there is the support for client side certificates but that may be
outside your current goals ;-).

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 2) Turn the core of XSP into a library.  I'd like to make a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Awesome. This is on my TODO list, but I have not got there yet. Probably
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Excellent. Do you think the configuration file access code should go
</I>&gt;<i> into the assembly or xsp.exe?  For example, my project doesn't use the
</I>&gt;<i> configuration file support provided by xsp since it has its own.
</I>&gt;<i> However, it may be handy for others to have this in the library.
</I>
&gt;<i> I've attached some &lt;initial&gt; patches for https, OnCreateHost delegate,
</I>&gt;<i> and some method accessibility changes. (needed by external apps)
</I>&gt;<i> Please review to make sure I'm headed in the right direction.  I'll
</I>&gt;<i> begin work on the configuration and assembly changes.  Once this is
</I>&gt;<i> completed, I'll send around final patches for review.
</I>

+		public XSPWebSource(IPAddress address, int port,
+			Mono.Security.Protocol.Tls.SecurityProtocolType securityProtocol,
+			System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate cert,
+			Mono.Security.Authenticode.PrivateKey key,
+			bool RequireClientCert)
+		{
...
+		public XSPWorker (Socket client, EndPoint localEP,
Mono.ASPNET.ApplicationServer server,
+			bool SecureConnection,
+			Mono.Security.Protocol.Tls.SecurityProtocolType SecurityProtocol,
+			X509Certificate Cert,
+			PrivateKey key,
+			bool RequireClientCert)

For many reasons you shouldn't use a specific key format for the private key
(e.g. Mono.Security.Authenticode.PrivateKey) but instead use the
AsymmetricAlgorithm class. E.g.

* the PVK format is old and weak (but well supported by makecert tool);
* many people will have a hard time to convert other (more secure) formats
(e.g. PKCS#12) to PVK;
* it's possible (but not supported today in Mono) to use non-RSA keypairs
(e.g. DSA and DH) for SSL/TLS. Which is why the
PrivateKeyCertSelectionDelegate returns a AsymmetricAlgorithm.

So for the moment I think you should write a basic helper ImportKey method
that takes the PrivateKey (and optionally a password) and return an
AsymmetricAlgorithm instance. That way anyone can easily extends the
supported data format (or hardware support) in the future without touching
the core XSP code.

Thanks
