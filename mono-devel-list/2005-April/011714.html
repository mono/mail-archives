<PRE>Hi,
    We have an app that uses a StreamWriter to write logging and
debugging info to a file.  If I terminate the app (Ctrl -c) when it is
running, then re-launch it, I get an access violation/ sharing violation
when the StreamWriter is created.  I can't seem to remember this being
an issue, before the IO layer became daemon-less.  This only affects
recent builds and our RedHat 9 box running 1.1.7 is fine.  However,
Debian running Revision 43534 is broken. And I know it affects Mac OS X
also.  I have included some sample code, and if needed I can file a bug
report.
 
Thanks
