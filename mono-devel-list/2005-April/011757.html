Hello Uma,

I'm CCing mono-devel-list to this email, so anyone who wants to review 
the code can find it at 
<A HREF="svn://mono.myrealbox.com/source/branches/Mainsoft.System.Data/mcs/class/System.Data">svn://mono.myrealbox.com/source/branches/Mainsoft.System.Data/mcs/class/System.Data</A>

1. There are 2 efforts made in the code: design improvements related to 
indices and bug fixes. Attached a brief design document of the indices 
redesign (questions are welcome). Regarding the bug fixes, I will create 
a relevant changelog.
2. The testsuite we have sent is nunit compatible. To run it, one need 
to enter the System.Data/Test/System.Data.Tests.Mainsoft directory and 
issue &quot;make&quot; command. After this, the following command should be issued 
(from the System.Data root):
MONO_PATH=&quot;../../class/lib/default;;$MONO_PATH&quot; mono  --debug 
../../class/lib/default/nunit-console.exe   
/output:TestResult-Mainsoft.log 
/exclude:NotWorking,ValueAdd,CAS,InetAccess 
/xml:TestResult-Mainsoft.xml  
../../class/lib/default/System.Data.Tests.Mainsoft.dll

Currently there are 36 failures in the HEAD branch and 7 failures in the 
Mainsoft branch.
 From the other side there are 4 regressions running the standard mono 
testsuite in the Mainsoft branch.

I'm analysing all this now and will provide resolution/explanation for 
each one of the above.

3. Will send later today.

Regards,
Konstantin Triger
