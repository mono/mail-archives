<PRE>Hello all!

I'm curious to know how many people are interested in building a
fxcop-like tool (<A HREF="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/fxcop/">http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/fxcop/</A>) based on Cecil
(<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Cecil/">http://www.mono-project.com/Cecil/</A>).

Cecil isn't 100% complete today but I've played enough with it to know
it's able to do a lot of stuff. Cecil doesn't yet guarantee API
stability which is both a curse (possible breaking changes) and a
blessing (anything is fixable ;-). The timing seems right...

I already did some Cecil-based &quot;tools&quot; that checks for some security
behaviors in the class libraries. Some of that could be turned into
&quot;rules&quot; similar on how fxcop works (and I know that if I don't do this
soon I'll end up with so much code that a rewrite won't be possible - or
at least fun to do ;-).

Now I could clean them up and release them &quot;as is&quot; but I fear that a
security-only tool(s) wouldn't be much used and, anyway, I prefer to
spend my time in the security area, i.e. outside where most of the rules
are, so I would probably be a regular but not overwhelming contributor.

So this seems a good opportunity to create a very useful tool for Mono.
Anyone want a share of that fun ?
