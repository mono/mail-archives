</I>&gt;<i> :)

</I>&gt;<i> However, the interesting thing is that running the same C program on Unixware
</I>&gt;<i> (and i'm doubly sure) doesn't miss a message. Infact on Unixware it seems to
</I>&gt;<i> buffer the messages automatically. I can see that when the sending process
</I>&gt;<i> finishes the C program is still receiving and keeps receiving for about 1min
</I>&gt;<i> 45secs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I'm off to investigate the differences between Linux (Suse 9.2 Pro) and
</I>&gt;<i> Unixware.

Hi Marcus,
If I had to deal with it, I'll put all the processing in a separate
thread, or will use async invocation (using the thread pool to save
cycles not creating my own threads) to deal with the input, thus
freeing the receiving loop only to get the data.
