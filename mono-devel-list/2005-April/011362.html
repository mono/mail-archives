Most of the port's patches have been with the port since the beginning.
A lot coming from NetBSD and then from Joe Marcus Clarke from FreeBSD
Gnome.  I'd like to get rid of most of those patches but have really
needed someone to go through and evaluate them to make sure they are
right.  I don't know C, I maintain Mono because I wanted to learn C#.

&gt;<i> As mentioned in my other reply, the threads stuff, and signaling seems
</I>&gt;<i> very up-in-the-air right now for *bsd*, but a working port at 1.2
</I>&gt;<i> seems a good goal to me, perhaps I can help further in the effort.
</I>&gt;<i>

Threads are really fun.  If you want to make your head asplode then take
a look at this summary of the Mono/FreeBSD threading issues:

<A HREF="http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/maillist/archbrowse.php/bsd-sharp-list/2005-March/000164.html?id=1498&amp;prjname=bsd-sharp&amp;mlname=list">http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/maillist/archbrowse.php/bsd-sharp-list/2005-March/000164.html?id=1498&amp;prjname=bsd-sharp&amp;mlname=list</A>

The links to the freebsd-threads@ emails are very useful too.  Actually,
the whole thread is pretty useful, the links are just a few snippets.
Keep in mind that very recently on -CURRENT libthr is now David Xu's
libthread which he mentions in one of the emails.  It would be nice to
see Mono work with libpthread and avoid libmap.conf to get Mono to work
right, but I'm all for what works.  Anyways, these are the biggest
issues holding us back right now and holding back a number of ports.
Feel free to fire patches my way and I'll include them in the port if
you want before you send them upstream.  Thanks.

Tom

(PS. Feel free to subscribe to the BSD# mailing list, you can get to it
from the link in my sig.  A good number of the FreeBSD users interested
in Mono are on there.)
