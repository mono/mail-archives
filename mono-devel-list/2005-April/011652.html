<PRE>Hi, all.

I have just entered into svn a bundle of new tests for System.Data
disconnected imported from Mainsoft tests.
The tests can be run using nunit and currently we have 36 known failures out
of 319 tests.
We will be working on the failures by integrating Mainsoft's changes to
System.Data disconnected mode into svn as outlined by the process described
below.
Our next step is to send to this dev-list a description of the changes we have
made and to have the changes available for all to review.

Eyal.

Subject: Re: Followup on System.Data drop (with Index redesign)

Hello,

&gt;<i> I'd like to follow-up on System.Data disconnected drop. Committing
</I>&gt;<i> the improvements of this new source code into mono is a high priority for us -
</I>&gt;<i> it is currently our biggest issue for using Mono's trunk latest directly in
</I>&gt;<i> our builds (and not from our own version control system).
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to agree upon the best method for doing the above and letting the
</I>&gt;<i> dev-list participlate in the process. The process I'd like to define is:
</I>&gt;<i>  * You will do an initial review of the new drop and provide us with
</I>&gt;<i>    proposed modifications and raise issues for discussions.
</I>&gt;<i>  * We will commit the new source code under a new branch under Mono's svn so
</I>&gt;<i>    everyone will have access to the code and can participate in the discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>  * We will add into this branch our tests and notify the dev-list on the tests
</I>&gt;<i>    additions. (We could also add the tests directly to the trunk, what do you
</I>&gt;<i>    think?)
</I>&gt;<i>  * We will then provide the dev-list with a high-level description of the
</I>&gt;<i>    modifications as well as the branch name so the sources could be viewed.
</I>&gt;<i>    We will then discuss the issues you (Suresh) will raise using the dev-list.
</I>&gt;<i>  * We have run already Mono's tests and we found two regressions. Once we
</I>&gt;<i>    commit into the branch we will discuss the resolution of these regressions
</I>&gt;<i>    over the dev-list (we think that the tests should be modified in this
</I>&gt;<i>    case and we definitely would like to discuss this in depth).
</I>&gt;<i>  * Once everyone is satisfied with the status of the branch we will merge it
</I>&gt;<i>    into the trunk.
</I>&gt;<i> The reason for the above process is that we made a lot of changes that are
</I>&gt;<i> inter-related because of the redesign of DataColumn indices that affected
</I>&gt;<i> a lot of the System.Data disconnected code.
</I>&gt;<i> Please let me know your opinion about this process and if you'd like to
</I>&gt;<i> define another or modify it.
</I>
The team in Bangalore and Atsushi are the developers that have been
involved in System.Data, so they have the last word, but Eyal's plan as
outlined above sounds great.

Since Eyal is talking about a branch, we could get the code into the
branch right away so the review can happen in parallel to these
discussions.

So Eyal's proposal has my OK.

Miguel
