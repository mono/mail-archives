Indeed. In the previous aio_* based implementation (was disabled by
default) I didn't get to test with non-blocking sockets. Today while
testing I had to decide whether to set the blocking status before
calling aio_* or disregard the patch. I ended up throwing away the patch
(and overwriting it by accident :).

Instead I implemented epoll support (in SVN HEAD now) that works pretty
well and had no caveats apart from the manual page not being updated.

</I>
The license of libevent allows doing that, but the code in
WIN32-Code/win32.c is using select(), not IOCP. I prefer waiting for
someone interested on it to provide a patch. By now this is the lowest
level item in my TODO list ;-).

Thanks for your input.
