My understanding is that the behaviour of aio with sockets
(and presumably pipes) is NOT (well) specified by POSIX.

And that the implementations reflect this in their lack of
dependability for this task.

Certainly as suggested you might ask Mr Provos if you can
import libevent and then just have an IOCP implementation
for Win32.

I think there are plenty of other example implementations
around too - you might look for non-forking web servers etc.

Its not a big task one way or the other - the main pain is
that you have to have a variety of systems to test and develop
on - but you'll need that for aio too in reality.

James
