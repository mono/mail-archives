only managed to port code thanks to help of other guys who kindly gave 
me access to their own boxen with Mono installed. :(

 From what I could see Mono 1.1.5 run fairly demanding async socket app 
happily and if that patch makes things better then you won't see me 
complaining about performance. :)

It should be noted however that my application is not bothered about 
latency that much.

cheers,

Alex
