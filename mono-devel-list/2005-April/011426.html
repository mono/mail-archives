<PRE>Gonzalo,

I have a number of updates to XSP that I would like to make, but I
wanted to run them past you before I started submitting patches.

1) HTTPS support.  I successfully integrated the Mono.Security
SslServerStream into XSP and served web pages to clients. (Firefox &amp;
IE)  The changes are primarily in XSPWorker &amp; XSPWebSource.  I still
need to make additional changes to jack it into the configuration
system (options from commandline or config file).  Any preferences on
how this is implemented?

2) Turn the core of XSP into a library.  I'd like to make a
Mono.ASPNET assembly (or other name) that could be embedded into other
programs.  xsp.exe would be a lightweight wrapper for parsing
command-line, etc.  I have the need to embed the XSP server into my
AppServer project, and it would be nice to have an assembly from the
Mono distro instead of copying the code and rolling my own.

3) OnCreateHost delegate.  My program publishes objects into the
AppDomain of hosted applications to provide services &amp; collect
information.  The delegate provides the ability to reattach these
objects when a AppDomain is reloaded.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts,
Brian
