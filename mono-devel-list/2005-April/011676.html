</I>That not a good reason insofar as async IO is concerned: the whole idea 
of having async IO is to support lots of
concurrent connections and 25 is nowhere near lots in my book. This 
limit in .NET is a big PITA, particularly because they have
not provided programmatical way to change it (at least in v1.1, can't 
speak for v2.0)

</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>No I can't, because I use async IO and its exact implementation details 
are not under my control: its just fact of live that it uses
threads in .NET. I can't really see any way out since using blocking 
sockets will require me to use threads (and probably run out
of them faster).

&gt;<i>One reason for this is that... you don't really gain too 
</I>&gt;<i>much by having 1000 threads all doing stuff at once... 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Generally I would agree with you, but I know for fact that I gain better 
performance using async IO (with sockets),
actual callbacks there don't do lots of work, so a single PC can support 
lots and lots of async sockets: certainly over 100

I found a solution (hack really) to make .NET programmatically change 
maximum limit of threads on Windows,
and on Mono I was under the impression that default limit was much 
higher than that in &quot;official&quot; .NET. How can it be changed?

Alex
