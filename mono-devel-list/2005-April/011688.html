</I>But if I were to redesign my application to use blocking IO for sockets 
instead of async IO, then, if I were to keep level of parallelism (and 
naturally I don't want to wait for one blocking call to complete to move 
to the other), I will have to create a thread for each of those blocking 
IO calls, thus still ending having to use plenty of threads.

 From what I understood blocking IO (at least for sockets) is done by 
actually using async IO and making artificial wait for its to finish and 
then return result, and therefore usage of number of threads should be 
as much or higher (more likely higher) than in async IO model that I use 
now.

 From here: <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Article:ThreadPool_Deadlocks">http://www.mono-project.com/Article:ThreadPool_Deadlocks</A> I 
understand that setting env var allows to change number of threads 
available, which is fine I suppose.
