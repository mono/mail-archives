<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> &gt; It would be useful that xsp has an --case-insentive option...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is definitely not my area, but IMHO such an option would add
</I>&gt;<i> clutter, and (most of all) be terribly inefficient.
</I>&gt;<i> Moreover, it would discourage people from writing portable code in
</I>&gt;<i> the first place.
</I>&gt;<i> After this somebody will ask that '\' will be recognized as path
</I>&gt;<i> separator...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have heard somebody trying to implement this sort of workaround
</I>&gt;<i> at a completely different level: as a FUSE based filesystem.
</I>&gt;<i> This (while Linux specific) would be a nicer approach IMHO.
</I>&gt;<i> At least it will stay out of the way of the xsp code ;-)
</I>
We need to get a solution of some sort for these problems: the filename
casing and the path separator.  

Some people will change their source code, some wont.  But even those
that will change their source code might accidentally not cover all the
possibly angles and you wont find about these things unless the whole
application is QAed.  The side effects of these mistakes are not always
obvious.  

I think this should happen somewhere in our io-layer, but dont know
exactly where.

Miguel.
