Handlers are mostly used in Web.config and the ASP.NET runtime uses 
reflection that makes it able to instantiate non-public types. This way 
users may not even realize that they are using internal types.

On the other hand if you want to hide or deny requests you can use just 
like HttpForbiddenHandler but you can have additional HTTP status codes 
and messages.

Of course you could duplicate this functionality in your own classes but 
it's easier to use existing framework classes.

I just realized that Microsoft documented HttpForbiddenHandler that is 
internal as well and is implemented in Mono:
<A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms404282.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms404282.aspx</A>

Originally HttpForbiddenHandler was exposed only in Web.config.
HttpNotFoundHandler existed in 1.x but was not exposed in Web.config 
until 2.0.

So people most likely know that these types exist and the might use 
them. I actually wanted to use it when I found out that we haven't had it.

HttpNotImplementedHandler is not used in Web.config and is most likely 
known by much less people but I found it in the prevously referenced 
book so I just implemented that as well to make the internal simple 
handler collection complete.
