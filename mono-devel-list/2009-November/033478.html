Although this might be strictly true if you want to react exactly as
Microsoft's documentation claims (I thought 100% compatibility with
.Net was not the primary goal of mono?), there may be other options
that result in similar performance

For example, the first call to GetBuffer() could &quot;coagulate&quot; the
chunks into a single big array (perhaps with extra space at the end),
and then *keep that array*.  Subsequent calls to GetBuffer() could
avoid the copy.

In the event that your initial chunk wasn't big enough when pushing
data into the buffer in the first place, a non-chunked implementation
would have had to make an extra copy *anyway* at the time of the push.
 So in the chunked implementation, the extra copy on the first
GetBuffer() is actually not an *extra* copy at all vs. the naive
single-buffer implementation.

(I've written an efficient implementation of chunked buffering in C++,
and these were the conclusions I drew after a lot of benchmarking of
my library.  YMMV in C#, etc.)

Have fun,

Avery
