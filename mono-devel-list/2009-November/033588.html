</I>The utility should be as seamless to use. With it consisting of two 
parts - one in IO portability code and another as a profiler module 
('profiler' being a misnomer here too, as the tool is by no means a 
profiler) it would require setting both MONO_IOMAP and passing 
--profile=iomap (or somesuch) to the runtime as they both are required 
for the code to be useful. This can be a problem for MonoVS or 
MonoDevelop, which would have to call the runtime with --profile for 
every app whether or not it is necessary, and also it introduces a 
complexity for users not familiar with Mono command line. To get rid of 
the disparity, one would have to switch IOMAP on behind the scenes if 
--profile=iomap was used and this is not a nice thing to do, imho. From 
the other end, the user would have to know that they need to specify 
'all:report' and pass --profile=iomap to the runtime - also not a nice 
solution.

&gt;<i> My main issue is about bloat, if we can make it work as an external tool
</I>There's not much bloat really. The only thing that can be considered as 
such is the addition to the mini_redirect_call function which checks if 
IOMAP reporting is active. I agree it's not a nice thing to do at this 
point, but it's not very costly in terms of execution time and code size 
(especially if related to what mini_redirect_call does). I've just 
removed the code from mono_string_new_utf16 without any harm to 
functionality, so the only part that remains in the string allocation 
functions is the one in InternalAllocateStr icall - which is NOT used by 
default anyway (mini_redirect_call overrides it with emitted code for 
managed string allocator) and so the code won't affect usual 
performance. I really think the impact on the runtime is kept to minimum.

&gt;<i> just fine, I don't see a reason to add it to the runtime.
</I>&gt;<i> As I mentioned, we can extend the profiling API to fit your needs.
</I>The profiling API has all that's needed - but if the code was there, it 
would have to hook up to the object allocation function and examine 
every single object whether it's a string and then store the string - it 
would cost more time it does with the current patch.

Find attached the new version of the patch.
