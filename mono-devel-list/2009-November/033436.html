<PRE>
I've started having a problem with WinForms apps some weeks ago which I 
attributed to my  modified Fedora installation. Now I found the same 
problem in a fresh Ubuntu 9.10 install.

The problem is WinForms apps not showing text on labels, buttons and 
most controls, like the MoMA screenshot attached.

This was tested with 3 different winforms apps, including the official 
MoMA download. It was tested on Fedora (rawhide) and Ubuntu 9.10, both 
with and without &quot;desktop effects&quot; enabled.

These were the constants: both Fedora and Ubuntu were 64 bit, both 
notebooks with Intel 965 graphics, both default mono 2.4.3 install or SVN.

I think this is too much of a bug to go unreported until now, and I 
still think this can be a problem with my installation. Can someone 
please confirm or deny this?

Regards,
Ernesto
