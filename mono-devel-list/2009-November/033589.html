Ok, how about doing it just like sdb?  Using the profiler API, but from the
runtime itself? We could ship the code in IOMAP and MONO_IOMAP=


 just fine, I don't see a reason to add it to the runtime.

Well, you just mentioned what you need from the profiler, a way to tell the
runtime that all you care about is string allocation.


Now, a few bits about your patch:

The whole mono_jit_stack_backtrace thing is not required, you can get the
same results with minimal perf hit by using mono_stack_walk_no_il.
This is true since mono_jit_stack_backtrace and mono_jit_walk_stack_from_ctx
are basically identical. All you need to do is return TRUE from
the user func once you got enough frames.

Using MONO_GC_REGISTER_ROOT here won't really work. It might work with
boehm, but that's far from optimal.

Since you use string as key, you can use  mono_g_hash_table_new_type with
MONO_HASH_CONSERVATIVE_GC
since the value has an embedded MonoString in it.

You can replaces all those types comparisons with &quot;klass-&gt;image ==
mono_defaults.corlib&quot; since
you discard corlib types anyway.

I just noticed you construct the hashtable without hash or equal functions,
this means keys will be compared by their pointer value
and not content. Is that as intended? Because it makes the whole chaining
you do here pretty useless as no 2 strings will be equal.
