</I>Yes, it is able to do that, but that's not my point. I don't want practically unused internal code 
in System.Web for the sake of matching .NET internals. If you want an internal type like this in 
System.Web, please make some use of it.

&gt;<i> Only 403 and 404 codes are treated specially, that means a more 
</I>&gt;<i> destrictive error page, but that should not make any distinction based 
</I>&gt;<i> on the origin of the exception, just the status code.
</I>That's the theory, yes - I'd like to be sure in practice that there are no regressions from 
introducing a new type for 404.

&gt;<i> No maintenance requirements come with these two handlers. They just 
</I>&gt;<i> should be treated just like any other external handler. Their sole 
</I>&gt;<i> purpose is to throw HttpExceptions with the respective status code.
</I>Once again, that's fine - but if we include them, I want them to be used and not just sit there. 
Code which isn't used is likely to erode with time (even if it's as simple as the code you posted) 
and we want to avoid that.
