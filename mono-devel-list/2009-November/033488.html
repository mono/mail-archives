<PRE>I have an updated ChunkedMemoryStream implementation that mimics  
MemoryStream behavior up to the default chunk size, at which point it  
starts to use chunks.  GetBuffer() consolidates all chunks into the  
main buffer, which means that any direct changes would be reflected.

Where can I find the mono unit tests for MemoryStream?  That will save  
me some time from having to write my own.  At that point, I would  
encourage everyone to look at it and try it out with real world data.
