It would be nice if, for a bit, we put a friendly error:

`MCS now requires the full file name (including .dll) of an assembly when =
referenced with -r:. See http://.../ for details'

With such a message in place, I think the idea is great.

Currently, mcs allows you to do two things that csc does not wrt library=20=

referencing on the commandline.

The first is:

mcs test.cs -r:System.Web

will compile successfully, where as the equivalent csc line gives you =
an=20
CS0006: Metadata file 'System.Web' could not be found.

This same error is seen in other places as well, where the .dll is left=20
off the commandline. MCS attempts to be smart (with good results) and=20
appends a .dll for you if it needs to.

It seems like we need to remove those checks, and require .dll on the=20
end. This is very much similar to the reason the /package stuff exists=20
in mcs. When compiling, you are supposed to compile against a specific=20
assembly file, not against something abstract.

Any thoughts?
