&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Should I add a PKCS#12 cert file to the Mono Store (Machine store) 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (mono /.../certmgr.exe -add -c -m Trust server16-cert.p12) 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or add only the CA to the trust store
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (mono /.../certmgr.exe -add -c -m Trust cacert16t.cer)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or anything else to get rid of this error message?.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It must be either the user or machine Trusted store (otherwise you'll
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get a trust error).
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; OK. But witch certificate is preferable to add to the store?: 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; a) mono /.../certmgr.exe -add -c -m Trust server16-cert.p12
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; or 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; b) mono /.../certmgr.exe -add -c -m Trust cacert16t.cer
&gt; 
&gt; Trust is transitive, i.e. the server will be trusted if it's signer is
&gt; trusted. So only the self-signed root certificate needs to be added to
&gt; the Trust store.

I interpret this as b) above is enough.

What I was wondering with this question was whether a) would solve 
the error #-2146762486 (CERT_E_CHAINING problem) on the server.



&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I also have a question about the trust of the root CA certificate.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The cacert16t.cer above I have created with the following 
&gt; &gt; &gt; openssl commands:
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; ...
&gt; &gt; &gt; $ openssl x509 -in cacert16.pem -trustout -setalias &quot;TrustedRootCert&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; -out cacert16t.pem
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; $ openssl x509 -inform PEM -in cacert16t.pem -outform DER -out
&gt; &gt; &gt; cacert16t.cer
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; is the first openssl command necessary since the signed client 
&gt; &gt; &gt; and server certificates, or at least its root CA, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; should be added to the Windows/Mono (Trust) store?.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Currently I use the cacert16t.pem file as -certfile 
&gt; &gt; &gt; when creating the client and server PKCS#12 files - 
&gt; &gt; &gt; with the openssl pkcs12 command.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Will the cacert16.pem file be enough?
&gt; 
&gt; I honestly don't know (without reading the man page myself). I don't use
&gt; openssl much (for x.509 related stuff) because (a) it's formats aren't
&gt; the one natively used in .NET and (b) I try to dogfood my own tools ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yesterday (after your previous email) I tried to use the MS runtime for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; client certificate without success (same failure). Somehow MS does
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something different* because the server can't verify the signature (and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it's not a key and/or decryption problem - the hash value is different
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but the padding is ok).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Using IE (with the SSL2 client hello) to do the same turned out another
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problem, very similar to the bug #76254 reported today.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [*] The client certificate testing is done with wget/openssl
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (linux/cygwin) - which sadly doesn't seems enough :(
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Please let me know if you come up with some solution.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have been working with the HTTPS communication for some 2 months now, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; and my boss is eager to get an solution :-).
&gt; 
&gt; Please open a bugzilla issue on bugzilla.ximian.com (e.g. &quot;SSL client
&gt; certificate doesn't work with IE.&quot;). That way you'll get notified as
&gt; soon as (and whenever) I change the bug status.

I interpret this as I shall create a new bug in bugzilla for this 
with a short summary of &quot;SSL client certificate doesn't work with IE.&quot;.
I will do that, after installing the CA root cert (cacert16t.cer) 
into the Mono's machines Trust store, and run a new test case 
for the bug report.
