&gt; Hi Fergus,
&gt; tanks for your work on Mercury.
&gt; I'm very interesting in this language and prolog.
&gt; What is the status of Mercury on Mono framework?

There's two issues there: one is building Mercury for .NET using the
Mono tools, and the other is running Mercury for .NET using the Mono
runtime.

Last time I checked, there was a problem with Mono not supporting
recursive assemblies.  I think this has been fixed in Mono since then,
but I haven't tried Mercury for .NET with newer versions of Mono.

The Mercury standard library implementation for .NET used to use C++,
but now it has all been rewritten to use C#.  However, I think there
are probably still some dependencies on the MS tools' command-line
interface which may cause problems for building Mercury using the Mono
tools.  Those would probably be pretty easy to fix.

There may well be other issues, but those are the only ones that I
am aware of right now.
