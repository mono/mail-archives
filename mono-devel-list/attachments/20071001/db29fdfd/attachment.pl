I just want to quickly point out that we have made numerous improvements
to the look and functionality of gtk+ on Win32 during the 2.10-2.12
cycle, and we are still working to further improve it.  If there are any
particular issues that are blockers for you in gtk+, please file bugs on
bugzilla.gnome.org and CC me, I would really appreciate it and hopefully
we can get it fixed.
