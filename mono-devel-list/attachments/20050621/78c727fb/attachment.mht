Hi Daniel,

&gt; What do I need to do to try out Open Office with Mono interop?

	It's pretty simple in fact.

	Grab HEAD mono/mcs from svn, build &amp; install.

	Unfortunately to get anything to actually run you need to also apply
the patch on this bug:

	http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=75119

	I keep hoping something like that will go up-stream ;-)

	With that mono installed &amp; in your path/ld_library path just configure
ooo-build with --enable-mono &amp; the rest should &quot;just work&quot;.

	Of course, up-stream mono has a habit of breaking wrt. some of the
things we try to do, however - it worked quite recently ;-)

	If in doubt read ooo-build/doc/mono.txt - which will show you how to
build / run the samples.

	HTH,

		Michael.
