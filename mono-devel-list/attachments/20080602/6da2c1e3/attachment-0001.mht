&gt; &gt; Hey,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This should be working(*) and we have unit tests for them. Please  
&gt; &gt; fill a
&gt; &gt; bug report and attach your PEM certificate to it.

&gt; Done,
&gt; to anyone interested here's the link:

Thanks. I have a good idea what the problem is. I'll confirm/fix this
asap (I got other things in gdb right now ;-)

&gt; I was also wondering, since in my project I use  
&gt; X509Certificate2.PrivateKey setter which throws unsupported exception  
&gt; (the certificate is stored in pkcs#12 along with private key, but  
&gt; while exporting I want to get rid of it) - it works ok on .NET. Is it  
&gt; incomplete API or some other kind of bug? When I export such  
&gt; certificate (with removed PrivateKey) from .NET to file (encoded in  
&gt; Base64) and then try to import it again using mono runtime I get  
&gt; exception that the certificate couldn't be loaded (again works  
&gt; on .NET). Should I report it as well?

Yes, absolutely!

Thanks
Sebastien
