Hello folks,

    I know that this is a very short notice, I should have mentioned
this in mid-December, but I completely blanked out.

    We are going to API freeze Mono this week.  If you have any API
changes that you want to make, please contact me directly.

    What this means is that the public API of the Mono-specific
libraries will cease to change, although we can continue to bug fix it
and document it.

    The .NET libraries already had their APIs set in stone, so those
will continue to be developed (implementing NotImplementedExceptions,
fixing bugs and implementing NET_2_0 protected code).

    Changes to the .NET public API to fix differences against the
published .NET interface is ok (specially in the 2.x universe, as Mono
1.2 will not guarantee .NET 2.0 support in full anyways, so things are
much more lax there).

    So in short: you can change implementation bits, but not public
interfaces.

    If an API change is /absolutely required/ this needs to be discussed
before the patch makes it into SVN.

Miguel
