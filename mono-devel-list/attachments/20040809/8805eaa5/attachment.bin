Hello Everyone, 


	I've decided to cross post this for the other Mac OS X users who
would like to try and get MonoDevelop running on their Macs. 


											Best,

</color>[MonoDevelop] Mac OS  X Instructions for MonoDevelop (kinda
long)

</bold>

Hello All,


	I can get MonoDevelop 0.5 working now however, i can not open a file
nor create one without the application crashing with the following
error:


	Too many root sets


Abort trap


	I have no idea what this means.


However, I was able to fix this error using the following steps (I
would be happy to field any questions concerning my installation for
other people who are attempting to do this). I've tried to collect
(and give pointers to places where I've gotten this material):




	Anyway: I wanted to post what I've learned about compiling and
installing MonoDevelop on a Mac OS X machine:


	1) install fink

	2) update fink to the "unstable tree"

		a) to do this go to /sw/etc/fink.conf

			go to this line: Trees: local/main stable/main stable/crypto
local/bootstrap

			add the following to the end of this line:  unstable/main
unstable/crypto

			The line should look like: Trees: local/main stable/main
stable/crypto local/bootstrap unstable/main unstable/crypto

		b) perform a fink selfupdate and fink index (this will give you
access to "unstable" packages that are critical to the installation

	3) Install ALL gnome packages and be sure to select ssl packages when
given the option

	4) install gtksourceview using fink

	5) install gtkhtml3 (this didn't install for me during gnome
installation)

	6) install gtk+2 (again this didn't install per gnome installation)


NOTE: The installation above can take about 1-2 DAYS of compile time
so be very patient (this depends on you disk and machine's speed...I'm
doing all this on a powerbook G4 1.2 GHz)


	7) install mozilla-dev using fink (compile will take MANY hours)

	8) follow instructions on go-mono website for gtksourceview, monodoc
etc.

	9) Download MonoDevelop 0.5 ./configure
--prefix=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/1.0/

	10) go to /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/1.0/etc/mono/

		a) edit the config file so it looks like:


		<<configuration>

        <<dllmap dll="cygwin1.dll" target="libc.dylib" />

        <<dllmap dll="libc" target="libc.dylib" />

        <<dllmap dll="libintl" target="libintl.dylib" />

        <<dllmap dll="libxslt.dll" target="libxslt.dylib" />

        <<dllmap dll="libmySQL.dll" target="libmysqlclient.dylib" />

        <<dllmap dll="odbc32.dll" target="libodbc.dylib" />

        <<dllmap dll="oci" target="clntsh" />

        <<dllmap dll="db2cli" target="libdb2_36.dylib"/>

        <<dllmap target="libgtk-x11-2.0.0.dylib"
dll="libgtk-win32-2.0-0.dll">

        <<dllmap target="libgnomevfs-2.dylib" dll="gnomevfs-2">

        <<dllmap target="libgdldock.dylib" dll="gdldock">

        <<dllmap target="libMonoPosixHelper.dylib"
dll="libMonoPosixHelper">

        <<dllmap target="libgtk-x11-2.0.0.dylib"
dll="libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0">

        <<dllmap target="libglib-2.0.0.dylib" dll="libglib-2.0-0.dll">

<</configuration>


(Found this on Monologue)


	11) Go to your <<MONODEVELOP_HOME>/build/bin

		a) edit your MonoDevelop.Gui.Utils.dll.config so that it looks like:

			<<configuration>

        				<<dllmap dll="gnomevfs-2" target="libgnomevfs-2.dylib"/>

			<</configuration>


	12) Edit
<<MONODEVELOP_HOME>/build/bin/MonoDevelop.SourceEditor.dll.config

		<<configuration>

			  <<dllmap dll="libglib-2.0-0.dll" target="libglib-2.0.0.dylib"/>

 			 <<dllmap dll="gtksourceview-1.0"
target="libgtksourceview-1.0.so.0"/>

		<</configuration>	


	13) Edit <<MONODEVELOP_HOME>/build/bin/gdl-sharp.dll.config

		<<configuration>

  			<<dllmap dll="libglib-2.0-0.dll" target="libglib-2.0.0.dylib"/>

  			<<dllmap dll="libgobject-2.0-0.dll" target="libgobject-2.0.so.0"/>

  			<<dllmap dll="libatk-1.0-0.dll" target="libatk-1.0.so.0"/>

  			<<dllmap dll="libgtk-win32-2.0-0.dll"
target="libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0"/>

		<</configuration>


	(ALL Information as per jepstone's Blog and Monologue)


	14) export
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/1.0/lib/:/sw/lib:<<MONODEVELOP_HOME>/build/bin/

	15) export
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/1.0/lib/pkgconfig:/sw/lib/pkgconfig

	16) startup X11 (you can get X11 from apple's website:
http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/x11/

		a) The X11 SDK is located on your XCode Tools CD that came with your
computer

	17) execute (in <<MONODEVELOP_HOME/build/bin) mono MonoDevelop.exe

	


	You will now see MonoDevelop in action (kind of because you won't be
able to open files or create them without getting a "too many roots"
exception)


To fix this:


	18) Kill MonoDevelop

	19) Get the xfree86 version 4.4 binaries from xfree86.org (get the
Darwin-7.x binaries)

	20) Run Xinstall.sh

	21) Rerun MonoDevelop.exe now there's joy ;)


							-B


Now, I would like to figure out how NOT to have to download XFree 4.4
as I would like to have the prettier interface that ships with mac ie.
I don't like the window manager that ships with XDarwin. Can someone
help me with that?


							Thanks!


										-B
