Dear Mono list,


We have a .NET project written originally on the PC, using VB.NET. It
is a Web Service. There's no UI, aside from the web-pages that it
publishes. The web pages are just the descriptions of the Web
Services. So, I read about Mono being able to do .NET stuff on UNIX-y
platforms, including MacOS X, and it sounds incredibly useful.


Anyway, most of my expertise is as a Mac programmer, not as a UNIX
guy. So my command-line experience is little, and my UNIX background
is almost nothing. So naturally, when I see installation instructions
like:


<fontfamily><param>Arial</param><color><param>3333,3333,3333</param><x-tad-bigger>	7. 
	Configure GTK# as per the following:
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/sw/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/X11R6/lib/pkgconfig \
PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH \ ./configure
--prefix=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/1.0


</x-tad-bigger></color></fontfamily>I naturally panic and think, "WTF?"


I'm not sure which parts need downloading, which parts need compiling,
etc.


So my question is, has someone written the "Installing and developing
Mono on MacOS X for Dummies" yet? The instructions on the Go-Mono site
seem to be written by someone more comfortable with UNIX, command
lines.


Thanks for any help.


-Dan.
