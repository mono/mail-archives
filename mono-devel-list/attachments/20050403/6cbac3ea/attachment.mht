&gt; There are many people complaining, not just those two.

In between FC2 and FC3, yum changed their metadata format in the headers
directory (generated by yum-arch) to files inside the 'repodata'
directory. To generate this new metadata format, we need a new tool call
'createrepo'. I installed the RPM and ran it on 1.1.6/fedora-3-i386. All
should be well now.
