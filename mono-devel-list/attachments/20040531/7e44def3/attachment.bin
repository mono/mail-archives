In my effort to address bug #59274, I tracked the problem down to
icu/glib in locales.c not replacing \0.


Attached is a patch for String.cs to replace the internal methods with
managed code.


There is probably a more efficient way of Replace(String, String), but
both of these methods have been tested and working for bug #59274 as
well as other Replace testings.  However, I'm a little unsure how to
test the culture dependancy of Replace(String, String).  Considering
the IndexOf call should determine the culture as well, it _should_ be
ok as far I understand the culture dependancy stuff.


If this looks good, let me know and I'll move on to some other methods
(like IndexOf).
