To install mono 0.95, I had to do some weird things with .dlls. I
believe I did the following:


1. Install the latest fink and set it for unstable packages by adding
the following to the "Trees" field of /sw/etc/fink.conf:

		 unstable/main unstable/crypto

2. I installed mono from fink and then removed it to leave the
dependencies.

3. I downloaded the mono source from cvs:


<fontfamily><param>Courier</param><x-tad-bigger>cvs
-d:pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.go-mono.com:/mono login</x-tad-bigger></fontfamily>

<fontfamily><param>Courier</param><x-tad-bigger>cvs
-d:pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.go-mono.com:/mono co gtk-sharp

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.go-mono.com:/mono co mcs

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.go-mono.com:/mono co mono</x-tad-bigger></fontfamily>


4. I already had gc and icu installed, but I don't think 0.95 used
them since I built it with:


	./configure

	make

	sudo make install


5. During the make, I got a bunch of nonsense saying that certain dll
couldn't be found. I downloaded the monocharge from
http://www.go-mono.com/daily/ to get all of the .dlls and .exes. I
then put them into the directory that the make process was looking it


pathToSource/mcs/class/lib/default


and


pathToSource/mcs/class/lib/net_2_0


6. I then ran make and it worked, so I ran

	sudo make install

7. mcs could not read the installed mcs.exe file in
/usr/local/lib/mono/1.0, so I replaced it with the monocharge version.


8. It worked.
