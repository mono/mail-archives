Hi all,

I've followed mono's progression with great interest the last few years,  
but since I'm very MS-bound I haven't actually used it myself. Recently,  
I've been working on a couple of side projects that I would like to see  
running on mono, but I would need help to get started (in the least) so I  
thought I'd ask here.

It would be a paid job, split up into several phases where we decide at  
each step if and how to proceed:

* (2-3 days) Get to know my source, write small app that uses the  
framework(s), rough estimate of possible problems and time for a mono port
* (? days) Make a decently working port of project(s).
* (? days) Help me continue refactoring code to make it less MS-dependent  
(i.e. all UI in separate dlls so they can be based on Gtk+, WPF, WinForms,  
and render using Gdi+ or AGG or other)

The main project is Endogine -  
http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/Endogine.asp
Related projects:
PaintLab - http://flowlabs.net
OpenBlackBox - http://openblackbox.net

Anyone up for it here? Drop me a note: jonas at jobe dot nu


BTW, I've been toying with the idea of using Endogine and OpenBlackBox  
(via AGG, OpenGL, and possible MyXAML) to write a XAML rendering  
subsystem. It's a huge task, I know, but I feel it will become important  
to have a non-MS alternative to WPF. Has there been any work done in the  
OSS WPF area yet?

Cheers,
Jonas Beckeman
