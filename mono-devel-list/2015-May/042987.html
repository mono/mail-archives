<PRE>Hi,
I have been experiencing some failures with the tests in mono/tests,
particularly in a single core configuration.

Firstly, the sleep test: when the delegated thread is started, the main
thread goes to call the StopWatch start method which requires JITting.
This involves gc interaction as objects are allocated. However, the
delegated thread gets up and starts issuing GC.Collection() calls which
end up occurring every 50 microseconds. This means the main thread never
gets a chance to get out of the allocation phase so never gets to execute
the stopwatch start, thread sleep etc. so the thread never ends. In a
multi-core configuration this is not a problem and the test passes. I
found by inserting a Thread.Yield() as the first method called in the
delegated thread eliminates the problem [1].

Secondly, the xxxxx-exit (e.g. thread-exit) tests will occasionally fail
with an abort due to &quot;suspend_thread suspend took xxx ms, which is more
than the allowed 200 ms&#8221; where xxx exceeds 200. This seems to be due to
the exiting thread sometimes not getting to the stage of setting the
thread-&gt;state to ThreadState_Stopped in the
ves_icall_System_Environment_Exit() processing within the 200ms time
period. Again, with multiple cores this is not a problem (or the problem
is much rarer). I found by inserting a mono_thread_info_yield() prior to
the suspend_internal_thread() in mono_thread_suspend_all_other_threads()
fixes the problem [2]. I am not sure this is the best option and it&#8217;s
still theoretically possible for the problem to still occur depending on
how heavily the system is loaded. I was wondering if the setting of the
state to ThreadState_stopped could be moved earlier in the process rather
than in thread_cleanup() or if there&#8217;s another alternative.

While the occasional failure has been experienced with some of the more
pathological tests, the trouble is they happen nearly 100% of the time on
a single core virtual machine, less often on a 2 core but in a virtual
machine environment where there may be 100s of virtual machines competing
for the real cores the probability of failure increases. In addition tests
in the main test suite also have failed for the same reason as described
in the second case.
