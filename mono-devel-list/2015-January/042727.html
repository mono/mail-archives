Okay, so Mono has an extensive test suite, which it runs using a bundled
copy of NUnit. This is 2.4.8. It really shouldn't be *installed* as it's
only there to support Mono's test suite execution, but whatever,
historical reasons.

The Debian packages are patched so that the internal Mono-bundled NUnit
is not installed, and instead the distributionwide version of NUnit is
installed instead (this version depends on your release, but it's 2.6.3
currently).

If you're depending on the NUnit version bundled with Mono, then you're
doing it wrong - but it's our own damn fault for allowing that situation
to happen.

Your app should say &quot;I need NUnit 2.6.3&quot; for example, and it's up to the
distributions to provide a package containing that version.
