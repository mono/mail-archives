</I>&gt;<i> (leaf cert) is provided by the server.  No matter what, the root
</I>&gt;<i> cert must exist in a predefined list of roots trusted by the
</I>&gt;<i> client.  This leaves a little bit of ambiguity around the process
</I>&gt;<i> of building the chain of intermediates - The server may send the
</I>&gt;<i> chain to the client, or the client may construct a chain any way it
</I>&gt;<i> can, but if it fails to build a valid chain, the connection is
</I>&gt;<i> considered untrusted/insecure.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is well known that mono ships with no trusted CA roots.  If a 
</I>&gt;<i> user wants to use a mono-based application to connect to any type 
</I>&gt;<i> of SSL/TLS server (including https), they are typically required to
</I>&gt;<i> use the &quot;mozroots&quot; command (part of mono) to populate the root 
</I>&gt;<i> list.  There are several things wrong with this -
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> #1, it's not user friendly to require users to manually run a 
</I>&gt;<i> command on the terminal before they can use standard internet 
</I>&gt;<i> resources.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> #2, application developers are very likely to automate the mozroots
</I>&gt;<i> process into their applications (I know I do).  This is cumbersome
</I>&gt;<i> to developers, particularly because mozroots is a console
</I>&gt;<i> application, not a class that can be called programatically.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> #3, Although people generally know about the empty mono root CA 
</I>&gt;<i> list, most people don't know there is a separate list of 
</I>&gt;<i> intermediates (also empty).  Both lists are empty by default, but 
</I>&gt;<i> mozroots populates the root list by downloading from mozilla.  The
</I>&gt;<i>  intermediate list remains empty.  There is nothing strictly
</I>&gt;<i> *wrong* with populating the root list and leaving the intermediate
</I>&gt;<i> list empty, but it means the mono client is fragile.  If the SSL
</I>&gt;<i> server fails to send the chain to the client for any reason, then
</I>&gt;<i> the client has no other recourse, and will fail to construct a
</I>&gt;<i> chain. The client could be more robust, if the intermediate list
</I>&gt;<i> were populated too.  Then, the client could usually build a valid
</I>&gt;<i> chain, even if the server fails to send the chain.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To validate this concept, I'd like to point out that Microsoft 
</I>&gt;<i> ships Windows with a list of roots *and* a list of intermediates 
</I>&gt;<i> populated by default.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;side note&gt; There is a bug in mono that prevents a mono server from
</I>&gt;<i> sending the chain to the client.  This bug is being worked on 
</I>&gt;<i> independently of this email.  Since a mono client has no 
</I>&gt;<i> intermediates, it means a mono client is doomed whenever it tries 
</I>&gt;<i> to connect to a mono server signed by an intermediate, which is 
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunately the real world norm.  Interestingly, if you run a 
</I>&gt;<i> .Net client and mono server, then the connection succeeds because 
</I>&gt;<i> the client is able to construct the chain from the MS list of 
</I>&gt;<i> intermediates.  Also, if you run a .Net server and mono client, the
</I>&gt;<i> connection succeeds because the .Net server successfully sends the
</I>&gt;<i> chain to the client.  The incompatibility problem occurs strictly
</I>&gt;<i> when a mono client connects to a mono server signed by 
</I>&gt;<i> intermediate.  This lends even more validity to the concept of 
</I>&gt;<i> populating a list of intermediates on the client, to make the 
</I>&gt;<i> client more robust. &lt;/side note&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a final piece of background information here, I need to point 
</I>&gt;<i> out that mono X509Chain currently does not attempt to use the 
</I>&gt;<i> intermediate store to build a chain.  So even if the intermediate 
</I>&gt;<i> list were populated, the mono client would still fail to build the
</I>&gt;<i>  chain.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So finally, I get to the meat of this email:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1- I would like to introduce a new way of populating the root list.
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to create a new MSRoots class, and corresponding
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;msroots&quot; wrapper console application, that can be used instead of,
</I>&gt;<i> or in addition to mozroots.  Users can run msroots from the
</I>&gt;<i> terminal, just as they are accustomed to do with mozroots. But
</I>&gt;<i> application developers can also use the MSRoots class to perform
</I>&gt;<i> the same job programatically - very easy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> MSRoots will follow the Microsoft practice of populating roots and
</I>&gt;<i>  intermediates, instead of following the mozilla practice of 
</I>&gt;<i> populating roots without intermediates.  Also, MSRoots will follow
</I>&gt;<i>  the MS selection of roots (currently 43 roots) and will not follow
</I>&gt;<i>  the mozilla list (currently over 140 roots).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Copyright and license terms are a sticky subject when distributing
</I>&gt;<i>  CA certs.  To avoid any difficulty, I support the current approach
</I>&gt;<i>  of *not* distributing certs, but instead, automating the download.
</I>&gt;<i>  It is absolutely legal (fair use) to distribute URL's that refer
</I>&gt;<i> to potentially copyrighted material; since the URL is only a 
</I>&gt;<i> reference, the URL is legal to distribute under fair use.  I hereby
</I>&gt;<i> volunteer to maintain a list of references, and to automate the
</I>&gt;<i> process of updating that list, so any random schmo or monkey could
</I>&gt;<i> trivially take over the job at any time.  I can establish some way
</I>&gt;<i> of automating a periodic comparison on a fully updated windows
</I>&gt;<i> system, versus the published list, and generating an alert whenever
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft's list deviates.  Upon alert, an unskilled human or
</I>&gt;<i> monkey such as myself would then manually apply a change to the URL
</I>&gt;<i> list, so literally no information (and hence no copyrighted 
</I>&gt;<i> information) gets copied from either Microsoft or the CA, and yet 
</I>&gt;<i> the list will ada pt over time to follow Microsoft's practices of 
</I>&gt;<i> root &amp; intermediate selections.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it's ok for the list of URL's to be hard-coded into mono, 
</I>&gt;<i> or distributed from a particular URL, or even a completely separate
</I>&gt;<i> open source project.  If it's hard-coded into mono, it will have
</I>&gt;<i> the advantage of always working, but users would only get updates
</I>&gt;<i> when they update mono.  If you think about it, that's actually a
</I>&gt;<i> pretty reasonable constraint, because updates to that list *are*
</I>&gt;<i> security updates, and users *should* be updating mono regularly for
</I>&gt;<i> bugfixes and security updates.  Also, there are well established
</I>&gt;<i> precedents - for example in Windows, you only get updates to your
</I>&gt;<i> root list if you run Windows Updates.  And in linux, you only get
</I>&gt;<i> updates to your root list if you run yum or apt updates, etc.  In
</I>&gt;<i> OSX, you only get updates if you run Software Updates.  So it seems
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable that users would only get updates to the mono MSRoots
</I>&gt;<i> cert lists when they run system updates on mono.  I endorse the
</I>&gt;<i> idea of distributing the URL's hard-coded into mono MSRoots class,
</I>&gt;<i> but ulti mately, this is a question for somebody of authority in
</I>&gt;<i> mono.  (Miguel?  Sebastien?  Someone else?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2- I would like to put effort into X509Chain.Build(), to make it 
</I>&gt;<i> smarter.  Obviously, since it currently doesn't even think about 
</I>&gt;<i> using the intermediate store, that's some obvious room for 
</I>&gt;<i> improvement.  All of the above talk about MSRoots is for naught 
</I>&gt;<i> until X509Chain.Build utilizes the intermediates store.  I am 
</I>&gt;<i> pretty sure, but I'd like to discuss in a separate email, that 
</I>&gt;<i> there are some other flaws in how X509Chain.Build() chooses to 
</I>&gt;<i> build the chain.  I wouldn't be able to specifically say right now
</I>&gt;<i>  - I'll need to look close and scrutinize first.
</I>
Extremely related: Mono 3.12 will ship with a new tool, cert-sync,
which populates the root CA store from a static concatenated file.
This will be executed on package install on Linux (on our
mono-project.com packages, Debian/Ubuntu derivatives once 3.12 enters
them, and hopefully other community distros), using the distro cert
store as input. That's /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt on Debian
derivatives, and /usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/ca-bundle.trust.crt on
Red Hat derivatives

tl;dr: Anyone installing or upgrading mono 3.12 from our packages will
get a populated CA cert store by default. No intermediates, since
that's not how these facilities are provided.
