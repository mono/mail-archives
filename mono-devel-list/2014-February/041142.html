<PRE>I'm a developer who uses mono and .NET a lot - and as such, I very often want to read the mono source to see how something is implemented.  (Someday, I'll probably stumble across something that should be improved.)

Before anything else, I'd like to ask, is there a preferred platform or IDE or something, for working on the mono source?  Some &quot;getting started on mono development&quot; document?  Although I've downloaded sources, it's not obvious to me, how to open in for example visual studio, and become a useful human being.  (Side note, I ran git clone for several hours today, and eventually decided to just abort it and download zip file.)

At the moment, I would love to simply be able to open mcs\class\System\System.Net.Security\SslStream.cs and see how it does the handshake, negotiating protocols and key exchanges, etc.  I would *truly* love to launch code examples, and have the ability to step through code, to actually observe its behavior.

At present, I'm blindly trying to open things in VS, without a project file or defintions of compiler symbols, and basically all the code is grayed out.

While I usually use VS, I'm happy to switch to a different IDE, if for example, Xamarin Studio is &quot;the preferred&quot; platform to develop on.  The goal that I care about is being able to browse, edit, and hopefully even build and debug code, as effectively as possible.

Thanks for pointers...
