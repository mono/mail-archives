<PRE>Hi Edward,

At least a couple of people including myself have an interest in recommended dev env to work on Mono itself ( <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-devel-list/2013-July/040638.html">http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-devel-list/2013-July/040638.html</A>). A Howto on recommended setup for Mono contributions would save a fair bit of time and hassle for contributors, but I have not heard of such a document.

You should find a Visual Studio solution under /mono/msvc/scripts. The Readme has some instructions as to how to re-generate solution and project files if you so wish.

A couple of years ago I updated the code that generates VS project and solution files, with the intent to be able to navigate and compile Mono C# in VS. You'll find related emails at <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-devel-list/2012-May/038908.html">http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-devel-list/2012-May/038908.html</A> and <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-devel-list/2012-May/038875.html">http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-devel-list/2012-May/038875.html</A>
While I originally aimed at developing and debugging with VS (in particular to benefit from mixed-mode debugging) I renounced. I guess this would require a revival of something like Mono tools for VS.

I'd like to hear from you if you find an IDE and tools setup that suits you.

Cheers

Subject: [Mono-dev] Getting started on mono sources

I'm a developer who uses mono and .NET a lot - and as such, I very often want to read the mono source to see how something is implemented.  (Someday, I'll probably stumble across something that should be improved.)

Before anything else, I'd like to ask, is there a preferred platform or IDE or something, for working on the mono source?  Some &quot;getting started on mono development&quot; document?  Although I've downloaded sources, it's not obvious to me, how to open in for example visual studio, and become a useful human being.  (Side note, I ran git clone for several hours today, and eventually decided to just abort it and download zip file.)

At the moment, I would love to simply be able to open mcs\class\System\System.Net.Security\SslStream.cs and see how it does the handshake, negotiating protocols and key exchanges, etc.  I would *truly* love to launch code examples, and have the ability to step through code, to actually observe its behavior.

At present, I'm blindly trying to open things in VS, without a project file or defintions of compiler symbols, and basically all the code is grayed out.

While I usually use VS, I'm happy to switch to a different IDE, if for example, Xamarin Studio is &quot;the preferred&quot; platform to develop on.  The goal that I care about is being able to browse, edit, and hopefully even build and debug code, as effectively as possible.

Thanks for pointers...
