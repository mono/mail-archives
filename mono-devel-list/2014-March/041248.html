Huh.  That looks like it deserves a closer look.  Thanks for the suggestion, I'll give it a try.  And I know this is OT now, and I can go ask their mailing list, I read their docs and I'm convinced it will gracefully put your package into standard locations, but I didn't see much of anything about dependencies or conflicts or upgrades.

Supposing I go to the effort of packaging up mono in x86, x86_64, rpm, and deb, and basically starting a 3rd party mono package site (even figure out how to create a yum repository and apt repository).  Which now seems very likely so I don't have to instruct customers to build mono from source.  The first obvious pitfall seems to be prerequisite checking (package dependencies) and conflicts (both detecting, and preventing, installation of the distro-specific ancient mono package) and the second seems to be upgrades.  If admins install the mono-3.2.8 package, and later the mono-3.2.9 package becomes available, we would want the package manager to cleanly remove 3.2.8 while simultaneously installing 3.2.9.

Do you have any experience doing this sort of thing?  Expect it to just work?  Ned, go away and talk to the fpm mailing list?   ;-)   I guess regardless of anything else, I'm going to join their mailing list and start talking about this kind of stuff.
