<PRE>I am calling the function in the DLL using interop, the function is declared in the c++ program as extern C. After all it&#8217;s just a void function with no parametres so it&#8217;s perfectly possible for it to have an extern C interface, and be non-mangled.

The exception that is not caught when running, is both thrown and caugt (in code) inside the c code in that function.. In fact the problem is with throw. A cerr&lt;&lt; statement the very next line after a throw is executed, which makes very little sense. mono is breaking some rules when setting stuff up before invoking a dll call (at least this is my best guess)

I fear that any assembly that calls a native VS2012 c++ DLL (possbly other compilers too) that internally depends on being able to throw and catch exceptions &#8211; will not work correctly on mono 3.2.3 on windows, even though it worked before 3.2.3

I cannot rule out that I am using some wrong compiler settings &#8211; if I do , the same wrong compiler settings are in the small project filed with the bug, as that project also shows the error.

I have filed a bug with two visual studio projects to build a C# program,and a c++ DLL (visual studio). I have deliberately tried to use as many default settings as possible, as that probably matches well with what is out there in the open. The C dll could be made somewhat simpler.

the bug report is here :

<A HREF="https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=14989">https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=14989</A>

It would be very interesting to have someone confirm that I am correct in my assumption that mono 3.2.3 does not work as it is supposed to do, when calling DLL&#8217;s on windows.

I am aware that exceptions thrown in a dll cannot be caught in the calling C# program, even though this works fine in .net. My c++ program does not leak exceptions to managed code. The example programs in the bug report doesn&#8217;t do that either)

regards,

Dennis

Er.. How are you calling this? Surely the function name gets mangled?

  (running on windows 7)

  In short, if I wrote this in a dll in .net or mono 3.1  i would get to &#8220;this shows&#8221;

  void tester() {
  try {
  throw(foo);
  cerr&lt;&lt;&#8221;this never shows&#8221;
  }
  ctch(...){
  cerr&lt;&lt;&#8221;this shows&#8221;
  }
  }

  However, in 3.2.3 above code when called via Pinvoke, will display &#8220;this never shows&#8221; , indicating that the data structures used by the exception system inside the DLL has been damaged by mono.

  I have created two VS2012 sample solutions to create a C# dll caller, and a C++ callee that exposes the problem &#8211; and filed a bug

  <A HREF="https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=14989">https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=14989</A>

  If someone have the time to confirm or comment, I would be very pleased. If I am not mistaken it is a pretty severe bug &#8211; it might happen that any vs2012 c++ DLL that uses exceptions internally has ceased to work with mono on windows. (the problem might be bigger, I havent tried to build dll&#8217;s with VS2010 or other languages).

  Anyways, I would expect mono to behave similar to .net, but it does not in this respect.

  Regards,


  Dennis
