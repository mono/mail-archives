<PRE>I believe that there are bugs in the makefiles way down where sgen gets built, specifically the way softlinks are handled that relate to this but also a few other problems. There are fixes that were recently applied to the trunk that fix it. I would have thought 3.3 would have the fixes but I guess not. I was trying to build 3.2.1 and became stuck at the problem you describe. When I obtained the latest mono from git that problem did not happen. There are a couple of more packages that mono is dependent on which were a problem for me also maybe you have that resolved.  I tried to backport the fixes from the master to 3.2.1 but there was too much and I could not get it to work and I wouldn't recommend that. I would move to mono from git or wait for the next tarball to be released and you should be good.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> then
</I>&gt;<i> rpmbuild -ba rpmbuild/SPECS/mono-core.spec
</I>At the very end I'll get an error like this:
    Symlink points to BuildRoot: /usr/bin/mono -&gt;
/home/marcel/rpmbuild/BUILDROOT/mono-core-3.2.0-0.x86_64/usr/bin/mono-sgen

what should I do?
