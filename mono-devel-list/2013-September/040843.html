<PRE>The reason this is not a good idea is that no matter whether mono is compiled
or just source. Mono is big but Cygwin installed is very big. I tried to zip
it just 4 grins but it took a long time. So I don't think that download
preinstalled Cygwin is good. I don't know who owns Cygwin but it is used for
various projects and each project might require a slightly different
installation. What seems to be hard is for developers to pick the correct
options to configure Cygwin for mono. If there was a concept of Cygwin
profiles wjocj would when chosen automatically set up a specific Cygwin
configurarion with no further intervention. In a dropdown you could select a
mono profile or whatever profile. Or even just have a default configuration
which support most things including mono. You would use one of theses
options instead of trying to pick the correct packages. It would select the
correct packages and run scripts which make sure paths and everything else
is correct to build mono. It could even get mono from git and configure and
build it. There is something lacking in the instructions that seems to mess
up a lot of developers. There may be other issues such as interactions with
different environment variables on the pc host. So maybe more detailed
installation instructions would go a long way. Just an idea and a retraction
on my suggestion of archiving installed working Cygwin installation. Its to
da*n big.
