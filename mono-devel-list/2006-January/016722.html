<PRE>&gt;<i> If you can send to this forum just the relevant diffs 
</I>&gt;<i> (patches) and, if
</I>&gt;<i> possible, provide a brief explanation about the changes, I 
</I>&gt;<i> will be glad to look into them.
</I> 
Ok I've included two different patches. The Full_Novell one is a complete diff
based on the code that JD provided to me, so that you can have a base of what
was provided to me. The second BoiledDown patch contains what I'm fairly certain
are the relevant fixes (If I wasn't sure I used JD's changes). The changes
appear to be mainly in what objects are used for locking and the scope of the
locking, a new threading class, as well as some more extensive exception
handling. Which makes sense as that's the issues I was having with the lib. 

If more detailed explanations are needed I'm afraid we'll have to hope that JD
is still reading the list and can respond.
