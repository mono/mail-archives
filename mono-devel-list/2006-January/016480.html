<PRE>Hello,

    We have created a branch for Mono 1.1.13, which is the release that
we are freezing for distribution as part of the next batch of commercial
Linux products from Novell.

    This means that we will be maintaining this branch for bug fixes and
security issues in the long term.   This means that we need to backport
bug fixes as well as test cases to this branch on an ongoing basis.

    We might have to appoint someone in charge of maintaining this
branch.

    Notice that there are a few components which are not frozen
(Windows.Forms, System.Drawing and libgdiplus as well PEAPI as it is an
internal library).   For those, we will backport the entire trees of
those directories as Mono progresses so there is no need to backport
individual fixes.

    If a fix is needed outside those modules to make those modules work,
please make sure that patch makes it into the branch.

Miguel.

</PRE>
