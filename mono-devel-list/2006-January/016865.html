<PRE>Hello,

I'm absolutely sure that your intentions are good. And I do want to take
a patch, just be sure that the race is really resolved. I'll work on it
sometime in the next few days and will reply with the results.

In the same time, if you can provide some more information/explanations
it would be very helpful.

Regards,
Kosta

&gt;<i> As I wrote in my analysis of your patches, I ran the application you

It didn't work reliably. Now it does. Our intentions are good. Search
for me on this list. I did some similar (very large) patches to
Mono.Security that are working quite well. Run your test suite if you're
worried about introducing bugs into the library. Please, just take the
patch! I don't want to maintain my own copy of this library.

Threading bugs are notoriously difficult to reproduce. If I remember
correctly (Again, I submitted this way back in August -- with only the
necessities patched), the issue was more easily reproduced on a slower
network connection where search results trickled in a bit more. The
background thread that parses the network data was adding results into
the collection while I was pulling them out from my thread. I was
testing over a VPN with about 30ms ping latency with the 2.0 build.
