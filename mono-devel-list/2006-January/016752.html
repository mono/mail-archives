<PRE>Actually, looking over the v2 data types:

<A HREF="http://sqlite.org/datatypes.html">http://sqlite.org/datatypes.html</A>

I see &quot;TIMESTAMP.&quot; I haven't tested it, but it's probably just a 64 bit
integer. However, if a column is of that type, it would be nice to
automatically convert to a System.DateTime using the appropriate
NativeConvert methods.

Just a thought.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There should be no compromise here. If sqlite3 can store 8 bytes in an

</I>&gt;<i> an Int64 or do some simple detection to see if the returned integer can
</I>&gt;<i> fit in an Int32, and then cast and return as such.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So... I'll undo that.  Do you think I should also undo string conversion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to DateTime for DATETIME columns?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a little tricky. I had some experience with this in October, and
</I>&gt;<i> we did some profiling on it. The problem is that DateTime.Parse (and
</I>&gt;<i> other various similar methods) is extremely slow. I think there were
</I>&gt;<i> something like 60 string allocations per invocation of that method. I
</I>&gt;<i> was using DATETIME in Banshee and parsing when pulling data from the
</I>&gt;<i> reader. Each row had two DATETIME columns, and on a 4k database, it took
</I>&gt;<i> about 20 seconds to read. The bottleneck was DateTime.Parse of course.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That being said, sqlite does store DATETIME values as strings, so there
</I>&gt;<i> are two options:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> a) Parse the date in a more efficient manner, keeping in mind that in
</I>&gt;<i> sqlite, it will always be in the same format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
</I>&gt;<i> (DateTime.Parse &quot;guesses&quot; at various formats).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> b) Do some hackery like this (not sure how you would do this in the
</I>&gt;<i> reader, since it needs to be done at the statement level, before
</I>&gt;<i> committing):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> SELECT strftime(&quot;%s&quot;, ColumnNameThatIsADATETIME);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The internal sqlite strftime function will convert the string to a unix
</I>&gt;<i> timestamp, normalized to UTC. You can pass &quot;localtime&quot; for example, as a
</I>&gt;<i> third argument to strftime if you don't want it in UTC.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would go with option (a). That would keep compatibility with databases
</I>&gt;<i> that use DATETIME and would expect a System.DateTime in return. Just
</I>&gt;<i> avoid DateTime.Parse. But do to the fact that internally the value is a
</I>&gt;<i> string, just using a DATETIME column in your table definition is
</I>&gt;<i> immediately less efficient than storing a timestamp.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With all this in mind, here's probably the best way to handle dates in
</I>&gt;<i> sqlite: store them as INTEGERS as a unix timestamp and let the
</I>&gt;<i> application use Mono.Unix.Native.NativeConvert.ToDateTime/FromDateTime
</I>&gt;<i> to read/write the values.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When I changed to doing this in Banshee, the load time went from 20 to
</I>&gt;<i> 1.5 seconds.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I wrote about this last month too, if you want more details:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you'd like I can take a look at the parsing issue and cook up a
</I>&gt;<i> patch, time permitting. It might also be nice to actually do detection
</I>&gt;<i> on INTEGER columns to see if it is appropriate to return an Int32.
</I>&gt;<i>
