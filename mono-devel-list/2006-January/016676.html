It's more complicated than that, as can be seen by the follow-ups by
kangaroo and Paulo Molari later in the thread.  In particular, these
responses:

<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-devel-list/2006-January/016432.html">http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-devel-list/2006-January/016432.html</A>

The short version is that Mono's JIT works on OS X/x86, but that's about
it.  The GC hasn't been ported yet, and the JIT-generated code doesn't
currently follow the OS X/x86 ABI (which probably impacts DllImport).

So if you don't need the GC and you don't need DllImport (I assume), the
current Mono should work for you.

I doubt that you're in this position.

&gt;<i> I am asking as I have an existing product using mono on OS X (that 
</I>&gt;<i> installs mono as part of its install) and I have no idea yet whether it 
</I>&gt;<i> is going to work on the x86 Macs.
</I>
The other issue you'll see is the lack of Universal Binaries (discussed
in the same thread), which won't likely won't be resolved before the
JIT/GC issues (if it's ever important enough for someone to spend time
getting Universal builds of GLib and other Mono dependencies...).

So once Mono is properly ported to OS X/x86 (which would likely be
within 1 week of kangaroo getting access to an OS X/x86 box -- anyone
care to donate access? ;-), you'd still need to provide separate
installers/packages for PPC and intel
