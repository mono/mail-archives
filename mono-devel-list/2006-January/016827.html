<PRE>Hi Chris,

Thanks for the response - I saw your plethora of commits, so am about to do a fresh checkout, give it a whirl, and I'll let you know ;-)

As for the Assembly.GetCallingAssembly() stuff, when I was looking at it and cooked up that patch, the assembly passed in to OpenExeConfigurationInternal was only used by the &quot;user.config&quot; stuff, and I couldn't see where that was ever actually being called anywhere else (but then again I didn't even realise you could have &quot;user.config&quot; files in your application data folder, so I left that bit well alone :-P).

That's interesting that it looks like web.config and exe.config handling is separate, I didn't realise that, as the MS implementation hides it quite nicely. I can't think of anything of the top of my head to resolve the usage of Assembly.GetCallingAssembly()/GetEntryAssembly(), however if I do think of anything I'll let you know.

In the meantime, I'll give the fixes you applied yesterday a go, and keep you posted as to how I get on :-)

Cheers,
Elliott

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Attached is a patch for the System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager
</I>&gt;<i> class, that fixes a bug I've found when using the NET-2.0 profile with the
</I>&gt;<i> new configuration objects in a web application. The problem appeared to be
</I>&gt;<i> with how the configuration file name was worked out internally within the
</I>&gt;<i> ConfigurationManager - it appeared to correctly find configuration files
</I>&gt;<i> for console apps etc, but couldn't work out the path to the web.config
</I>&gt;<i> file for a web application. This seemed to result in it simply returning a
</I>&gt;<i> null for custom configuration sections and app settings within web apps.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The patch tidies that code up a bit, and uses
</I>&gt;<i> AppDomain.CurrentDomain.SetupInformation.ConfigurationFile to retrieve the
</I>&gt;<i> path to the configuration file. I've tested it with a test web app, which
</I>&gt;<i> now can correctly retrieve custom configuration sections, app settings and
</I>&gt;<i> the like. I've also tested a very simple console app to ensure that still
</I>&gt;<i> works, which it does.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As always, comments welcome, I haven't supplied a test case for this bug
</I>&gt;<i> as it's reproducable by simply trying to retrieve an app setting or
</I>&gt;<i> configuration section when using the NET-2.0 profile
</I>&gt;<i> (xsp2/mod-mono-server2) on the latest version of Mono from svn head,
</I>&gt;<i> however if anyone really wants my test code then give me a shout and I'll
</I>&gt;<i> wrap it up for use elsewhere.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Oh, and I'm aware that Chris Toshok is actively working on the
</I>&gt;<i> Configuration 2.0 API, and so Chris, if your reading this, your probably
</I>&gt;<i> the most knowledgable person when it comes to this particular bit of code
</I>&gt;<i> - if you've got any comments, if I've missed the point, or if this was
</I>&gt;<i> something that you knew was broken/was broken for a reason/you've fixed
</I>&gt;<i> but haven't checked in yet, then let me know :-)
