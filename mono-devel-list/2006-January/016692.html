<PRE>Hello Mike,

The entire lib may contain some irrelevant changes that will be hard to
separate from the actual bug fixes.

If you can send to this forum just the relevant diffs (patches) and, if
possible, provide a brief explanation about the changes, I will be glad
to look into them.

Regards,
Konstantin Triger

Subject: RE:[Mono-dev] Ldap and Threading

Concerning my earlier issue JD Conley provided me with a copy of the
Novell LDAP
lib that he had changed to fix similar issues he was having to mine,
those
changes fixed the deadlocks and race conditions I was having. I've spoke
with
him and he's fine with those changes being ported in to Mono's copy of
the lib.
The issue is that his changes appear to be against a copy of the Novell
Forge
version of the lib and as such do not include changes that have been
applied to
the mono version. 

My question is if there is someone I to whom I can send this updated lib
to so
that they can import the changes into mono's copy? I'd gladly do it
myself but
I'm having trouble following the code due to my lack of knowledge of
LDAP wire
protocol and BER encoding. And so I think it'd be better for everyone if
I left
the merging up to someone with a more solid understanding of what goes
on during
the library's connection.

If like to take a shot at it please drop me a line or reply here and
I'll get
you hooked up with a copy of the lib.

Mike Glenn
