<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; If you can send to this forum just the relevant diffs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (patches) and, if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible, provide a brief explanation about the changes, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will be glad to look into them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok I've included two different patches. The Full_Novell one is a
</I>complete
&gt;<i> diff
</I>&gt;<i> based on the code that JD provided to me, so that you can have a base
</I>of
&gt;<i> what
</I>&gt;<i> was provided to me. The second BoiledDown patch contains what I'm
</I>fairly
&gt;<i> certain
</I>&gt;<i> are the relevant fixes (If I wasn't sure I used JD's changes).
</I>
Yes, most of the changes centered around thread synchronization issues I
ran into and exception handling. I did also &quot;clean up&quot; some things I
noticed while I was in there.


&gt;<i> If more detailed explanations are needed I'm afraid we'll have to hope
</I>&gt;<i> that JD
</I>&gt;<i> is still reading the list and can respond.
</I>
Yup, I'm still listening. Thanks for putting this together Mike. I had
submitted a patch to the Novell LDAP project and apparently it never got
rolled in anywhere.

There may also be some discrepancy in the version used to do the diff.
The code I sent you was based on the Novell release version 2.1.3 at the
time (August). I see they're up to 2.1.4 now.
