</I>
I don't think the segfault has anything to do with the kernel issue.
Using strace, the signal to handle the propagation to the threads of the
uid info is sent unconditionally, even when the uid is the same as the
current. Moreover, the segv happens inside the io-layer (even if it's
inside libc for me, it happens after an assertion in io-layer fails).
I think it might be related to the shared files the io-layer mmaps:
once the uid is changed it could be that the memory is no longer
accessible (changing just the gid causes no segv). Changing perms on the
files doesn't fix the issue, so I'm not completely positive on this...
Even if we could solve this, though, it would be wrong for a user
process to still use /root/.wapi/*: we'd need to provide an API that
changes user and does all the needed setup correctly.
