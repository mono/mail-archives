<PRE>Hi London,

First answering your latest question: Yes, Monodevelop is mostly written in C#.

Back to what I could understand as your main question:

To write a compiler for a new language that will run on Mono/,NET, you can:
-1- Write it in C#, or another Managed Language. The main advantage
here is to have access to libraries that already do the hard work of
generating the binaries (IL code) that your compiler should produce.
Additionally if you choose C#, you can look at some good compilers
already written with like Mono's own C# compiler (mcs) or Boo's
compiler (booc).
-2- Write it with some non-managed but well supported language, like
C/C++/Objective-C/Java. It is quite harder to generate managed-code
binaries this way.
-3- Write it with your own language (that was what we at Mono did with
our C# compiler), but that mandates that you have some other compiler
for your language available to &quot;bootstrap&quot; the process (we used MS's
csc in Windows until the point that mcs could compile itself at which
point we switched to use a previous stable version of mcs to build the
newer versions).

For a totally new language, you probably could use a mix of 1 and 3:
build a minimal compiler in some stable language and them use it to
build a compiler in your own new language. That was the intent with
Boo, but AFAIK Boo devs could not find time yet to migrate the
compiler from C# to Boo, itself.

Another take on an educational project, you could use Boo
extensibility features to cook a derived-tailored-improved language
(Boo makes it easy to write DSLs Domain Specific Languages).

Hope it helps,


Rafael &quot;Monoman&quot; Teixeira
