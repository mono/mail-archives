<PRE>I updated to change # 149641, re ran autogen.sh, ran make, make install and
tried running the tests again and it still failed.

I think it might be related to a problem with &quot;make install&quot;. Looking back,
I remember this happened last time and I overlooked it.
When I run make install after running make, gmcs throws an exception.

I attached a debugger, and the problem appears to be inside CodeGen.Init, at
the call to DefineDynamicAssembly. It is oring in an extra 0x800 into the
access parameter that is passed in.

I looked into the mono implementation of AssemblyBuilder, and it looks like
the flag is being used to signal to AssemblyBuilder that the call is coming
from inside the mono c# compiler.

The problem, however, is that GMCS is binding to the MS implementation of
mscorlib, not the mono implementation, and so the extra flag is invalid.

In the gmcs source, if MS_COMPATIBLE is defined, the extra value won't be
ored in.

Obviously it's not defined.

The bug could be either:

1. That MS_COMPATIBLE is not set
2. Or, that make install is binding to the MS framework implementation and
not the mono framework implementation

I do have mono installed on the machine, and it is included in the cygwin
path.

Do you (or anyone else) have any pointers as to which of these might be the
problem?
