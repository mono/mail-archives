Actually, it looks like right now only Novell employees have access to
Testopia. There's a bug filed to open Testopia up to external people.

I talked with the guy who's overseeing this, and he said that they hope
to have all of their security audits and whatnot done in the next few
months.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> testrun results, that simply doesn't make any sense

Actually, all of the non-security related Mono bugs can be seen without
having to login. Mono bugs are completely open to the public by default.
When filing a new bug, you actually have to manually change the bug to
internal.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> test setup has just been started, so allow for some teething
</I>&gt;<i> problems:)
</I>&gt;<i>

Exactly! :)

&gt;<i> Once the current release work is completed I'd also like the
</I>&gt;<i> testopia features to be available to contributors, so that
</I>&gt;<i> testing for architectures and systems we don't have access to (or we
</I>&gt;<i> don't have testing bandwith for) can be done by contributors
</I>&gt;<i> and collected in the same place as the test runs we do in house.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
The Mono QA team would like this very much. We understand just how much
the OSS community helps us out, and we'd love for Testopia to be a
coordination point for this work.
