<PRE>Hi Miguel,

I would love to see a Xen DomU guest image as well.  I realize that VMWare
has a free offering, but it is not open source.  Xen's hypervisor was built
into Microsoft's Virtualization server.  It is part of OpenSuse and the new
Linux kernel has a lot of it baked in.

Mono should run on a better VM player i.e. Xen running with Dom0 host such
as OpenSuse, Fedora, Gentoo, etc.  I realize that there is a documentation
effort, but I strongly believe that increasing the Xen community can do
nothing but good for Mono.  Xen is much more efficient with memory and it
would be a nice fit for the Novell/FOSS marketing machine.

&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">bounces at lists.ximian.com</A>] On Behalf Of Miguel de Icaza
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The current VMWear player is one of the greatest things Mono has to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; boost exploration of Mono. I love it. In fact I love it so much, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; want another!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What about a VMWear player setup with Mono source and SVN so one could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just fire it up, update the source from svn and start contributing?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is a very nice idea;   We are going to update this with a new
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSUSE 10.3 installation as well.
</I>
Thanks,

Vlad
