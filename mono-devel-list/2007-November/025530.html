Hey! I think that solution rocks!
Mono global version number could have something like 7.11.2, and each 
specific component could have a version number that matches the progress 
of it to target .NET features. For example:

Mono 7.11.2 released! It contains:
- WinForms 1.8
- ADO.NET 1.9
- Olive 0.8 (which includes .NET 3.0 specific stuff):
* WCF (80% complete)
* WCS (40% complete)
- LINQ 0.7 (.NET 3.5 stuff)
