<PRE>
This is a snapshot of my work on the new profiler, to be reviewed
so that will hopefully commit it.
BTW, committing it will also ease future reviews, because I will
maintain a ChangeLog and be able to post proper patches...

What's included:

mini-profiler-patch.diff
A patch needed to make it work... in *principle* it should not be
necessary, (I'd like it to work also during the finalization phase
in the runtime cleanup) but for now it's needed.

mono-profiler-logging.txt
Documentation.

mono-profiler-logging.c
The profiler itself.
To build, you should likely set HAS_OPROFILE to 0.
Todo:
- Minor enhancements: track stack top (or, even better, a portion
  of the call stack) to be able to emit METHOD_EXIT_IMPLICIT events
  without specifying the method that's returning because it is the
  top one (the file decoder already supports this).
  Also, emit object size in the class mapping when it's constant,
  and omit it from the CLASS_ALLOCATION event.
- Also track unmanaged symbol names in the statistical profiler.
- Figure out why I cannot decode names from UTF8, and must use an
  ugly piece of code that works in ASCII.
- Major new development: do heap profiling like in heap-shot.
  This should benefit from the logging infrastructure (events are
  lock-free when they happen, the lock is used just when saving).
What changed from the last posted version:
- File blocks have an explicit length (code and length form a six
  byte header).
- Packed event codes were added.
- Fixes and cleanups...

mono-profiler-oprofile.c
A simple oprofile integration.

decoder.tar.gz
A managed decoder for the profiler output file, which replaces the
perl prototype I posted the previous time.
For now just build it with &quot;gmcs *.cs&quot;, anyway is is properly
separated in a decoding library and a (for now toyish) console
front end, and it allows easy reuse of all the data structures
in a GUI.
I *should* document all the general data structures and interfaces,
anyway their intent is that you could use the decoder with your
own internal data structures to do your own data processing.
I mean, all these things are totally decoupled:
- file reader (works in blocks),
- file decoder (feeds events into an event sink),
- event processor, and
- data structures that hold the processed data.
- Plus, of course, the front end that shows them :-)
The included code provides implementations for everything, but each
piece could be replaced if needed.
The main question, here, is: where should this go in svn?

I would happily commit at least mono-profiler-logging.c and
mono-profiler-oprofile.c inside mono/mono/profiler, even without
proper oprofile detection in the Makefile (and therefore keeping
HAS_OPROFILE false in the logging profiler, and keeping
mono-profiler-oprofile.c out of the makefile).
And the mini patch, of course...

Ciao,
  Massi

-------------- next part --------------

The logging profiler.


Motivations:

The main issues the current profiler has:
- It stores all events in memory, and the events still point to
  the internal data structures (mainly MonoMethod* and MonoClass*)
  so that it cannot really work when dynamic methods are freed
  and-or appdomains are unloaded.
  For now a couple of gross hacks are in place (basically, if
  &quot;mono_profiler_get_events () != 0&quot; methods are never freed),
  but we should get rid of them.
- It processes all the data at the end of the process execution,
  so these things are not feasible-easy:
  - getting profiling data while the process is still running,
  - having the data presented better by different front ends.

The main differences of this new profiler is that It does not &quot;process&quot;
the profiling events, it just logs them into a file. They are as packed
as possible (a few bytes per event).
Therefore:
- it can &quot;survive&quot; when data structures are freed,
- one can write front ends that examine the log and show the
  data without being tied to the Mono runtime and without
  having to wait for the process to end,
- but... it will produce large log files.



Implementation strategy:

The idea is to keep a limited number of events in memory, and
write them on disk periodically.
To minimize overhead, we use one event buffer per thread, so
that in the general case (the buffer still has space) no locks
are used.
However, we need to use a global lock while writing the events,
and while managing shared data strucures.

Another important issue is the following: when we write each
event to disk, how do we identify the item (method or class)
it refers to? In memory we have pointers to MonoMethod structs
(or MonoClass, MonoImage, whatever...), but what makes sense
for the end user is just the item name.
As rewriting the item name at every event would be insane, we
map each item into a number (an ID), and write the ID.
Therefore, we need to keep in memory a map from the pointers
(MonoMethod* and friends) to the IDs.
Since this map is a global data structure, accesses to it must
be guarded by locks.

In practice we write the map on the file before writing the
events, so that any reader program will be able to decode the
IDs as it finds them.

To simplify the internal representation of events in the per
thread memory buffers, we decided to allow only four kind of
events in them:
- method related ones (carrying a MonoMethod*),
- class related ones (carrying a MonoClass*),
- object related ones (carrying a MonoObject*), and
- simple ones (like GC related events) which do not refer to
  runtime data structures.
On the other hand, events related to assemblies, images and
application domains are handled separately, without the per
thread buffers. The rationale is that the locking overhead
would not be significant anyway (these events are relatively
rare), so complicating the event representation in the buffers
was not a good idea.

Also the statistical events are handled differently, with a
buffer of their own, because they happen in signal context
and therefore could interfere with the regular ones.
When the buffer for statistical events is full, since we
cannot acquire a mutex in signal context an helper thread is
used to write the data (this thread can use the global lock).

In the end, the output file is organized in blocks:
- One intro block, carrying basic info like the start time,
  the runtime name, and so on.
- Mapping blocks
- Per thread event blocks.
- Statistical event blocks.
- Other events (related to assemblies, images and appdomains).
- And end block.
The reader program should expect any number of the &quot;middle&quot;
blocks (everything but intro and end) in any order, and be
able to process them.
The only constraint is that it is guaranteed that every ID
is defined in a mapping block before it is used in an event
block (so that the file can be read sequentially in a single
pass).



Implementation details:

Internally, we want to make event storage as fast and compact
as possible.
To make it fast, we use per thread buffers to avoid locks,
and we do not lookup the item ID (again, because accessing
the global map would require locking), but we store the item
pointer directly instead (MonoMethod* or MonoClass*).
To make it compact, we stuff the info in two fields: one
pointer sized one, for the MonoMethod*, MonoClass* or an
integer value, and other 32 bits for all the remaining info
(see ProfilerEventData in the code).
Moreover, if the value is a timestamp, we only store it as a
delta relative to the previous value, so that the value will
be very small.
To keep processing time low, we never convert counter values
into proper time values, and leave this job to the post
processing program, that can do it easily using the initial
and final time stored in the intro and end blocks (or any of
the &quot;clock&quot; info found in blocks in the middle of the file).

When writing to disk, we use the following strategy:
- Block codes are written as simple bytes.
- Integer values (IDs, timestamps, sizes...) are written in
  a compact encoding similar to BER, which takes little
  space and is easy to decode while reading sequentially.
- Strings are written as ASCII null terminated strings.
  We could/should look into supporting proper unicode item
  names in the future.
Inside event blocks, for now the event &quot;stream&quot; is encoded
with each event taking the following:
- One byte for the event type.
- Two integers for the event data, which typically are an ID
  and a value but in special cases can be other things.
This means that each event takes at least three bytes, and
its size is larger if the values are larger.
In the typical case, the timestamp (being relative) is very
small and takes one byte, while the ID takes one or two
bytes. It is very rare having common events taking more than
five bytes.
Moreover, frequent event types are encoded in a &quot;packed&quot;
way, where only three bits are used in the code byte, and
the remaining five are &quot;chained&quot; to the first integer
value. This gives us 12 bits to store it, meaning that the
most typical case (ID &lt; 4096, counter delta &lt; 128) will
for in just two bytes.

Other interesting implementation details are related to how
the writing of events is done, and how we deal with the case
when internal runtime structures are freed.

The main concept is that once a structure is in the maps
(it has an ID), we also extract its name from the runtime,
and put it in the map as well.
&gt;<i>From then on, the profiler will actually never access the
</I>runtime data structure again, it will simply use the pointer
value as an internal ID for the item (and a key in the hash
table which is the map).
Moreover, once the map has been flushed to disk, the names
can be safely freed, because we will never need to write
them again (of course the item must still be in the map,
because handling the events we must be able to map its
pointer into its ID, only the *name* can be freed).

Of course we cannot build the maps while receiving the events
because this would require access to the global lock.
So we build (and flush) them just before writing event data
blocks into the output file.

The typical sequence of actions is the following:
- An event happens, but the per thread buffer is full.
- The lock is taken.
- We scan the buffer, putting all unmapped pointers into the
  maps. Here it is convenient that the events can only be
  related to MonoMethod and MonoClass structures, because the
  scanning pass only looks at a couple of bits to know what
  the pointer is, without wasting time understanding the
  actual event. So we have exactly two maps of this kind, one
  for methods and one for classes.
  All the new map elements are also appended to a list of
  unwritten items.
- Flushing a map to disk is then just a matter of walking
  its &quot;unwritten items&quot; list.
- Once the maps have been updated and flushed, we can safely
  flush the events, knowing that every pointer will have its
  ID in the maps.
- We then flush the file and release the lock.
- This per thread buffer is now considered empty, so we take
  its first slot and use it to store the current event.
Note that during all these actions all the other threads are
not blocked and can continue storing events in their buffers.
They need to block only in the following cases:
- their buffer is full (so they need the lock), or
- a &quot;global&quot; event occurs (related to an image, assembly or
  application domain, which also need the lock).

Handling global events is tricky (and therefore separated
from the &quot;common&quot; ones) for two reasons:
- When loading an item, the profiler API emits two events,
  one to signal the load start and another for the load end.
  However, at load start the name of the item is not
  available. If we had the event in the per thread buffer,
  and the buffer filled requiring a flush between a load
  start and a load end, we would have no name to put in the
  map. This could be solvable, but would make the sequence of
  actions described above more complex for no good reason.
  Instead, we handle maps of loaded global items separately.
- When unloading an image or appdomain, it can happen that
  many MonoClass and MonoMethod items will be freed.
  This is an event that affects all threads, not just the
  current one: pointers to those items could still be stored
  in the per thread buffers of other threads.
  It is true that no *new* events can happen related to the
  freed items, nevertheless we must make sure that the other
  threads can continue to operate on their buffers without
  problems even if they contain pointers to freed items.

The easy and safe way to handle the unload scenario is to
update the maps scanning *all* the per thread buffers, and
not just the current one.
Remember that one an item is &quot;mapped&quot;, we have its name and
we never need to follow the item pointer again, but we
could still use the pointer value to access the map.
Scanning the buffers of other threads is safe as long as we
stop before the first unwritten event: the thread can go
on storing new events safely, because it writes past that
point and because the new events cannot be related to the
items that will be freed (and therefore need to be mapped).
If, eventually, the thread will finish its buffer, it will
just block on the lock and wait its turn to write its
remaining events.

For now, to keep the code simple and be on the safe side,
we also flush to disk the portion of each buffer that we
have mapped, and keep track of it (see first_unwritten_event
field in ProfilerPerThreadData).
We also do not free the map items, even if we could.



Output file format

We'll describe each block as a sequence of fields, where
three data types are allowed:
- BYTE (used only for block codes),
- INT, and
- STRING.
We write strings as null terminated ASCII strings.
We store integers one byte at a time, seven bits per byte,
starting from the least significant bits.
We put the eight bit in the byte to 1 when we write the
last byte.
As a special encoding case, we store the block code as a
two bytes little endian unsigned integer, and the block data
length as a four bytes little endian unsigned integer.
So, each block has a fixed size six bytes header.
The length field is the length of the data excluding the header.
The idea is that a decoding program does the following:
- read six bytes, and see block code and size
- if it is interested in the block, read the following &quot;size&quot; bytes
  and decode them, otherwise skip exactly &quot;size&quot; bytes
- read nest block...
Then, we use the shortut &quot;CLOCK&quot; to mean two INT values,
which are respectively the current timer &quot;counter&quot; value, and
the current time (in microseconds from the Unix epoch).
Each block carries at least a CLOCK about at the beginning,
and if the block is potentially large also at the end so that
the reader program can also measure the time it took to
produce the blocks.

Here is the description of the various blocks:

Intro block (code = 1):
INTEGER: file format version, for now 1.
STRING: runtime file image.
INTEGER: profiling flags, defined by the &quot;MonoProfileFlags&quot; type.
CLOCK

# The loaded block kind is stored as a bit field, where the bits have
# the following values:
# LOADED_EVENT_MODULE =     1;
# LOADED_EVENT_ASSEMBLY =   2;
# LOADED_EVENT_APPDOMAIN =  4;
# LOADED_EVENT_SUCCESS =    8;
# LOADED_EVENT_FAILURE =   16;

Loaded element block (code = 2):
BYTE: block kind.
INTEGER: start counter value.
INTEGER: end counter value.
INTEGER: thread id.
STRING: item name.

Unloaded element block (code = 3):
BYTE: block kind.
INTEGER: start counter value.
INTEGER: end counter value.
INTEGER: thread id.
STRING: item name.

Mapping block (code = 4):
CLOCK
INTEGER: thread id.
# A sequence of the following (class mapping):
INTEGER: class ID.
STRING: class name.
# And finally, a 0, which is the end because no ID can be 0.
BYTE: 0.
# A sequence of the following (method mapping):
INTEGER: method ID.
INTEGER: class ID.
STRING: method name. # The &quot;class&quot; portion of the name is omitted
# And finally, a 0, which is the end because no ID can be 0.
BYTE: 0.
CLOCK

Event block, for common &quot;per thread&quot; events (code = 5):
CLOCK
INTEGER: thread id.
INTEGER: base counter value. # All counter values in events are deltas
# A sequence of the following (events):
BYTE: event code.
INTEGER: main event value.
INTEGER: secondary event value.
# And finally, a 0, which is the end because no event code can be 0.
BYTE: 0.
CLOCK

Statistical block, for statistical events (work in progress, because
we still do not handle mapping names of unmanaged functions):
BYTE: block code = 6.
INTEGER: start counter value.
# A sequence of the following (hits in managed code):
INTEGER: ID of a method that got a statistical hit.
# And finally, a 0, which is the end because no method ID can be 0.
# A sequence of the following (hits in unmanaged code):
INTEGER: ID of a function that got a statistical hit.
# And finally, a 0, which is the end because no method ID can be 0.
INTEGER: end counter value.

End block:
BYTE: block code = 7.
INTEGER: file format version, for now 1.
INTEGER: end counter value.
INTEGER: end time.

This is all, now let's see how events are encoded.
We count the bits from 1 (least significant) upwards.
In the event code, here are the bits:
- Bit 1 to 3: packed event code:
enum PackedEventCode {
	METHOD_ENTER = 1,
	METHOD_EXIT_IMPLICIT = 2,
	METHOD_EXIT_EXPLICIT = 3,
	CLASS_ALLOCATION = 4,
	METHOD_EVENT = 5,
	CLASS_EVENT = 6,
	OTHER_EVENT = 7
}
- Bits 4 to 7: extended code.
  If the packed code is not &quot;METHOD_EVENT&quot;, &quot;CLASS_EVENT&quot; or
  &quot;OTHER_EVENT&quot; these bits are &quot;chained&quot; to the first integer
  value in the event, as least significant bits.
  Otherwise, they are interpreted as following:
- If the packed code is &quot;METHOD_EVENT&quot;,
  bit 4 is the MethodEvent:
enum MethodEvent {
	JIT = 0,
	FREED = 1
}
- If the packed code is &quot;CLASS_EVENT&quot;,
  bits 4 and 5 are the ClassEvent:
enum ClassEvent {
	LOAD = 0,
	UNLOAD = 1,
	EXCEPTION = 2
}
- In the two above cases, bit 6 is the EventResult:
enum EventResult {
	SUCCESS = 0,
	FAILURE = 4
}
- If the packed code is &quot;OTHER_EVENT&quot;,
  bits 4 to 7 are the GenericEvent:
enum GenericEvent {
	THREAD = 1,
	GC_COLLECTION = 2,
	GC_MARK = 3,
	GC_SWEEP = 4,
	GC_RESIZE = 5
}
  and bit 8 is the EventKind:
enum EventKind {
	START = 0,
	END = 1
}

For method events, the main event value is always the method ID,
and the secondary event value is always a timestamp (remember that
timestamps are always encoded as delta relative to the previous
timestamp in the current event stream).
For class events, the main event value is always the class ID,
and the secondary event value is always a timestamp, except for
the case of allocations where it is the size in bytes of the
allocated object.

For GenericEvent, the two event values are used as following:
- thread event (main: thread id, secondary: timestamp)
- GC collection (main: generation, secondary: timestamp)
- GC mark (main: generation, secondary: timestamp)
- GC sweep (main: generation, secondary: timestamp)
- GC resize (main: new size, secondary: timestamp)
