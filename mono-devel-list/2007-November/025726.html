Yeah, I agree that having how many bugs filed vs how many bugs closed
would be a very good stat to have. I've recently figure out how to show
how many bugs were filed against Mono during a given week (see my reply
to miguel's e-mail). However, I have not figured out how to determine
how many were closed. If you have know how to do this in bugzilla,
please let me know and I'll add it to my bug count e-mails.

</I>&gt;<i> resolved, wontfix, invalid, etc)
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I can't even seem to get how many were closed, let alone break them up.
Again, if you know how, please share. I would be very interested in
these stats as well! :)


Thanks,
Thomas
