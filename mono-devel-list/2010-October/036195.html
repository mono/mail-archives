<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would suggest to fold this into the preexisting section. Does Darwin/x86
</I>&gt;<i> not define __MACH__?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
__MACH__ is an antiquated way to detect an apple machine. Newer code, both
out in the world and within the mono tree (e.g. mini-x86.h) seems to use
__APPLE__. Obviously, do what you want here, but that was my line of
thinking.



&gt;<i> And are you sure that __native_client_codegen__ on OSX should influence the
</I>&gt;<i> file name extension for shared libraries?
</I>

Since __native_client_codegen__ is the only pre-existing case where we do
aot on x86 mac, I was being extra careful to make sure that when it's
defined, the pre-existing behavior is unaffected. I'm unsure whether
__native_client_codegen__ depends on filename extension and am not in a
position to test it.

If you happen to know better then that condition is unnecessary.


 What warnings are you suppressing there? The surrounding archs don't appear
&gt;<i> to.
</I>

The debug information size expression (Ldebug_end - Ldebug_begin) causes a
warning because it's not computable at assembly time since the sections are
relocatable. This doesn't appear to cause a problem in practice, but it does
cause a warning message.



&gt;<i> Same thoughts wrt the extension here.
</I>

Same response.


Is that a typo? The latter part of the #elif would never be true since it is
&gt;<i> handled in your #if already.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes..good catch. The latter part of the #elif should go.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Andreas
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Given my responses above, let me know what you think and I will prepare an
updated patch.

Thanks,

Brian
