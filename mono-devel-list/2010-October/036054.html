<PRE>  Hello,

thank you for your review. I tried to use the style of the existing code 
but I guess I missed some spaces.

The problem with your modifications is that it defeats the purpose of my 
patch. In .NET I can host a method with a definition like:

[OperationContract]
[WebInvoke(UriTemplate=&quot;set?name={name}&amp;value={value}&quot;)]
void Set(string name, string value);

In Mono I couldn't. This is why I created the patch. With your 
modifications the problem still exists, but now in a different place.

ValidateStyleForMessageFormatter shouldn't reject a method like the one 
above. Like the modified Validate method it should consider the 
UriTemplate. In the method above there is no need to wrap because 
everything is passed in the URI. That works for .NET and also works for 
Mono if the validation is less restrictive. I think the major problem 
with my patch is that it doesn't work if the UriTemplate is null. With 
only that fixed the test RejectTwoParametersWhenNotWrapped will not 
break and it also works for my purpose.

I also checked the .NET behavior for WrappedRequest and WrappedResponse. 
In .NET the BodyStyle WrappedRequest resolves problems with multiple 
inputs and WrappedResponse with multiple outputs. That is what I 
expected and it is the opposite to what is done in 
ValidateStyleForMessageFormatter.

So I created a new version that hopefully resolves all issues.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The Validation of WebHttpBehavior is very limiting. If a POST

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and WrappedResponse look very strange. I have to wrap my response if 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have multiple input parameters? That looks wrong.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I looked up in the MSDN what the Validate method does for .NET, and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then I tried to make the .NET implementation fail. It just doesn't 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> behave like specified in the documentation, it never fails no matter 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I attach a patch that will make the Validate method less picky. It 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will look for placeholders in the URI template and only after that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decides whether wrapping is needed or not. That is still more 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> restrictive than the .NET implementation but for me it looks like the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> right thing to do. I also added a test that reproduces the problem.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Please accept the patch and give me some feedback on what I can
