<PRE>To go a little further: many good .NET controls, opensource or not, use
win32 calls. Many developpers I have met only know the win32 APIs and nor
their equivalent in Linux. Typically, many well-known commercial GUI
toolkits (componentOne, devexpress, infragistics, ...) use Win32 calls and
so cannot run on Linux.
 
If Mono was providing a class to interface/hide these platform-specific
calls, that would drive people to port/create nice .NET controls, including
all the commercial packages above, that could run on Mono/Linux. That would
be a great result, wouldn't it?

Right now, I'm using only a very limited subset:
GetFocus,
ResetMouseHover
ScrollWindow
 
So obviously, I could manage it manually. But I was thinking about porting
various opensource controls, available on Internet and which uses
GUI-related win32 calls (such as the ecellent DockPanel). As a lot of work
has been within XplatUI and its &quot;drivers&quot;, I was looking at reusing them. My
first idea was to ask about making all/some XplatUI's methods public. But
maybe the easier way is to extract what's needed from these classes (easier
but not smarter way though).

Making it public would make your code not work on Windows's Windows.Forms.

What exactly do you need from the XplatUI?

Hi all,
 
I'm creating a custom control (a list view with extended functionalities)
and would need to access some low-level GUI methods provided by the XplatUI
class. This in order to access platform-specific actions (scroll window,
mouse actions...) without to explicitly test the platform / call the right
platform's API - and to avoid to redo what others have brilliantly done!
 
Yet, XplatUI is defined as an internal class and so cannot be accessed
directly.
 
Is there another way to access it? Or could it be made public in a future
version of Mono?
 
Regards,
 

Lionel
