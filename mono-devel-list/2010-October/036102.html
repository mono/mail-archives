<PRE>Hello,

    I have created a diff file from the formatted sources that removes
some of the other automatic changes that probably came out of some
refactoring tool.   The patch itself can not be used directly against
Mono's source code since it is still a diff from formatted to formatted,
not from Mono to formatted.    This means that we are going to have to
apply every patch by hand.

    I personally like the changes that were made by the tool, like
dropping the gratuitous overuse of namespaces in the Managed.Winforms
code, and would love to plug those changes back in the future.   

    In terms of how to get the changes merged, ideally, Ralph could
review the attached file and provide a roadmap of what each of the
changes do.   There are some that I suspect wont be controversial, for
example:

	* There is a refactoring of the Clipboard code, this seems 
	  straightforward, but it still needs a review.

	* Some look like simple bug fixes, but it would be good to 
	  know what were they fixing (for example the ListView.cs 
	  changes).

    There are other pieces that look like they went through a lot of
work, and a more detailed explanation of the changes would be useful, in
this group, I would include:

	* Hwnd.cs

	* XplatUICarbon.cs

    There are some that probably we can skip, like the System.Drawing
tracing facility.

     The cleaned up patch is here:

	<A HREF="http://tirania.org/tmp/changes.gz">http://tirania.org/tmp/changes.gz</A>

     This is the diffstat.  aNot sure how to deal with this, perhaps
with a Google doc, where we can use colors to flag what is applied and
what not?   Or perhaps we remove parts of the patch when we have
manually applied that bit?
