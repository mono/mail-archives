<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> From: &quot;Zoltan Varga&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Other than that, I think the patch is ok to check in. One thing that
</I>&gt;<i> is missing is
</I>&gt;<i> tests. Since the patch changes so many places in the runtime, if there are 
</I>&gt;<i> no
</I>&gt;<i> automated tests, the functionality will probably get broken by changes
</I>&gt;<i> since people
</I>&gt;<i> have no way of noticing when they broke it.
</I>
Thank you very much for the approval. I attached a final version that I'm 
goint to check in if approved (with ChangeLog entries of course). This 
version should contain all you suggested modifications.

Note that I realized that images were loaded twice with my original patch so 
I made some modifications and I added two new functions: 
mono_get_module_file_name and mono_image_open_from_module_handle functions.

The other things are unchanged so I think the easiest way to see the 
differences is to compare this patch to the previous one.

Thank you very much for the help.
