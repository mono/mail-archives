<PRE>Hi,

Attached the updated patch.

I realized that mono_marshal_get_vtfixup_ftnptr was broken and I 
reimplemented it without using mono_marshal_get_managed_wrapper.

I also have done some modifications to gc.c.

There is a comment in the patch /* FIXME: do we need this? (image is 
disposed anyway) */ about some code I think should be removed because it's 
unneeded. Is that code required?

Korn&#233;l

&gt;<i> Thank you very much for the review and your comments.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Windows (now build with cygwin as well)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - appdomain.h: This is a public header file, so the new functions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   should go somewhere
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   else, like domain-internals.h
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - domain.c: The code here could be put into a function in corree.c.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Put mono_module_handle and coree_handle into some header file like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   coree.h, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   there definitons into corree.c for example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - corree.h: Please include &lt;config.h&gt;, since that contains the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   definition of PLATFORM_WIN32.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - image.c: mono_cli_rva_image_map is part of our public api, so its 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> signature
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   cannot be changed, you can rename it to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mono_cli_rva_image_map_internal, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   change the signature of that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had a look at &quot;C:\Program Files\Mono\include&quot; and it doesn't contain any 
</I>&gt;<i> declaration. Is this public for sure? If it is I'll do what you suggested.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - The usage of 'raw_data' is a bit confusing: sometimes it is used as an 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> address
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   (like in mono_cli_rva_image_map), sometimes it is used as a handle 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (everywhere
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   else). Which is correct ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> HMODULE is the actual pointer to the base address (position of the DOS 
</I>&gt;<i> header) of the module. Also note that there is no such thing as HINSTANCE 
</I>&gt;<i> it is a heritage of the Win16 shared address space and HMODULE and 
</I>&gt;<i> HINSTANCE are the same in Win32. In Win32s (Win32 API on Win16 that is not 
</I>&gt;<i> really Win32 compatible) HMODULE is definitely not the base address but 
</I>&gt;<i> someting else that may be a handle. So raw_data is actually the raw_data 
</I>&gt;<i> but unlike the current implementation sections are mapped to the actual 
</I>&gt;<i> virtual addresses. Even checks in map functions could be omitted but I 
</I>&gt;<i> didn't remove them to ensure that the image is correct.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - cil-coff.h: Please don't declare constants in the middle of a a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   structure definition.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK. I actually tried to follow what seemed to me being the coding 
</I>&gt;<i> convention of that file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - gc.c: The comment about mono_thread_attach () might be incorrect, but 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   thread_started_event stuff is definitely needed to avoid races when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   the runtime is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   shut down before the finalizer thread can start. So I don't think we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   can remove this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I see there can be no race because there only are &quot;mono_thread_current 
</I>&gt;<i> () == gc_thread&quot; checks. Even if &quot;mono_thread_current ()&quot; returns NULL 
</I>&gt;<i> (that is unlikely I think) nothing will happen on the thread if the 
</I>&gt;<i> finalizer thread in not initialized yet. Actual work is only done by 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;finalizer_thread&quot; that is being executed only in the finalizer thread. If 
</I>&gt;<i> for some reason &quot;mono_gc_cleanup ()&quot; is called before the finalizer thread 
</I>&gt;<i> is initialized &quot;WaitForSingleObjectEx&quot; will wait for two seconds for the 
</I>&gt;<i> finalizers and thus for the finalizer thread being initialized. If it 
</I>&gt;<i> fails to initialize within two seconds finalizers won't run of course but 
</I>&gt;<i> the same is true for finalizers that werent processed in two seconds so I 
</I>&gt;<i> see no big difference. If really need &quot;WaitForSingleObjectEx 
</I>&gt;<i> (thread_started_event, INFINITE, FALSE);&quot; can be moved just before 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;WaitForSingleObjectEx (shutdown_event, 2000, FALSE)&quot; but I don't see any 
</I>&gt;<i> reason to do so. If I'm wrong please let me know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Korn&#233;l
