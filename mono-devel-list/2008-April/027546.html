<PRE>Also 100% pure .NET programs can use WinProc which in included in System.Windws.Forms controls.
   
  There are more and more 100% pure .NET apps out there. Many of the third party control libraries are using that in their advertisments.
   
  I would love to see Mono running on Wine.
   
  When we started using WINE for SWF, we had to have our own version of WINE.
  By the end, we could use standard WINE with a small patch attached.
   
  I know the WINE project has offered a WINE-Mono bridge as a Google Summer of Code project last year and the year before, but I don't think anyone ever signed up for it.
   
  It is my understanding is that the PThreads issues has long been resolved.
   
  This is based on my memory, which is subject to a lot of soft errors.
