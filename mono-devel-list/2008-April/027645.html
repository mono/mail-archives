<PRE>Oops, sorrry, I was dead for couple of days and after that it has dropped
from my mind for a while.

Here's my quick survey:

- You cannot add any public extra stuff (such as Mono.Messaging.* classes)
  in System.Messaging.dll. You have to create another assembly (such as
  Mono.Messaging.dll) and use it together with System.Messaging.dll.

  It is sort of mess, as either

  - System.Messaging.dll depends on your extra assembly and hence yours
    cannot use any types in System.Messaging.dll (e.g. you cannot define
    IQueue.Deliver), or
  - your extra assembly depends on System.Messaging.dll and hence any
    types in yours inside System.Messaging.dll must be used through some
    reflection foo, or
  - you have to run cyclic build between those two assemblies (we do it
    for System.dll, System.Configuration.dll and System.Xml.dll, which is
    a mess).

- At least MessageQueue.Create() should be implemented (otherwise it is not
  practically functional as System.Messaging.dll). It would have to be done
  by some configuration support to indicate one IMessagingProvider, and it
  must not be dependent on System.Configuration.dll which is 2.0-only.

- It would provide only simple part of Sys.Messaging functionality (it would
  apply to any JMS/AMQP based solution). We could still go with your
  bridge implementation for a while as a compromised solution though.

And as Miguel pointed out, we would have to avoid your GPLv3-based component
as run-time dependency.

I have some comments on the patch details, but I'd put my general survey 
first :)
