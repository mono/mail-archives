</I>
Well, I know just a little of how sharing works and I wasn't sure if it did
build
rgctx for inferfaces or not. Since it doesn't, using a chained rgctx won't
do
any good for collections, at least.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I expected that for F# sharing would have saved some overall time since
</I>&gt;<i> JIT
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; activity is a lot smaller.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had hoped for that, too, but it's not there.  Not that I'm terribly
</I>&gt;<i> unhappy, though - I saw generic sharing as mainly a memory
</I>&gt;<i> optimization.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; By the way, talking about the F# case, generic sharing compiles 27% less
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; methods, but only reduces
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  the compiled code size by 6%. These numbers seen odd to me. Is generic
</I>&gt;<i> code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; really that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; smaller than non-generic or is the added code for sharing support that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; result on these numbers?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll look into it in more detail, but it seems that generic methods
</I>&gt;<i> are usually very short, more so than non-generic methods.  And we do
</I>&gt;<i> generate code that's a bit longer, but not by much.
</I>

Other thing, how does sharing and inlining play together? I guess inlined
generic code
uses rgctx a bit less as it has precise type information at hand. If so,
wouldn't
more aggressively inlining generic code reduce the need for rgctx?
