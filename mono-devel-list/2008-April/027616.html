I'm looking at a problem on FreeBSD/amd64 running web services. Last known
version
to work with our code was 1.1.3.1 (yeah i know its old). I'm testing this on
1.9 from the BSD# project.
For the record the same code works as expected on mono/xsp 1.9 on Linux.

The application throws &quot;Thread was aborted exception&quot;, for one the processes
executed to compile the asp.net code. (Though the first one completes just
fine).
While waiting for the processes to exit in
CSharpCodeCompiler.cs:/CompileFromFileBatch,
the process returns WAIT_IO_COMPLETION.

However the initial problem I encountered was different. While in the above
function, I was getting a NullReferenceException (in StreamReader) while
trying to
read stderr/stdout before WaitForExit. After making sure the code generated
for asp.net
was compiling without any errors, I disabled the redirection and assigned
empty strings
to the mcs_output/mcs_stdout.  Next show stopper was the &quot;Thread was aborted
exception&quot;.

I know the above is not much of a help, but I'm still debugging and try to
to figure out what is happening
so that I can provide a decent bug report and possibly a patch for this.

Though if anyone has an idea what might be going wrong, looking at my
horrible explanation above,
would be great to share any ideas.

cheers,
