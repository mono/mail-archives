But what percent of .net apps are pure?  If that fraction is small,
as I suspect it is, then for Mono to really rock the world, it's going
to have to tackle impure apps, too.  That is of course incredibly difficult,
and would require considerable cooperation between the Mono and Wine projects.

If both Wine and Mono continue on their current upward trajectories,
I predict that such cooperation is inevitable, despite past friction.
