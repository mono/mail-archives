<PRE>&gt;<i> From: Robert Jordan
</I>&gt;<i>I think the following code is from another patch set (the cmd line
</I>&gt;<i>encoding issue you sent a patch for). Is it complete?
</I>&gt;<i> Index: mono/mono/mini/main.c
</I>
Yes, it is. I included it in this patch to be consistent with _CorExeMain
implementation. Also note that command line arguments are parsed as UTF-8
without MONO_EXTERNAL_ENCODINGS. MONO_EXTERNAL_ENCODINGS should not be
supported on Windows, Unicode API should be used instead. Patching main will
make Mono support non-ASCII command line arguments on Windows. Also note
that because images are loaded using LoadLibrary file names are expected to
be in UTF-8 that is supported by this main function patch.  I still would
vote for removing MONO_EXTERNAL_ENCODINGS support on Windows but that is out
of the scope of this patch.

&gt;<i>If this is solved, I will try to fix the cygwin build.
</I>
I managed to fix the build. #include &lt;config.h&gt; had to be moved out of
#ifdef PLATFORM_WIN32 because PLATFORM_WIN32 is defined in config.h in the
cygwin build.

Please review the patch. Please try it on Linux as well to make sure that it
doesn't break Linux. And if you like it, please approve the patch.
