As pointed out previously by someone, Sun's Java Media Framework is  
not the best point to model from. It is much too complicated and  
inefficient to use, and can be considered mostly dead (we had to use  
it at university for a project, but Sun hasn't offered new releases  
for years). The open source MFJ replacement aimed to be binary  
compatible and didn't seem to tackle the design issues.
(our use case was video cut detection, i.e. navigating to frames,  
capturing, analyzing and displaying them)

The JMF does have platform-dependent support for codecs itself (some  
are Windows-only), hiding the codec details from the user and allowing  
to add new codec support.

If you're referring to some other Java media specification, please say  
so to avoid confusion.

Andreas
