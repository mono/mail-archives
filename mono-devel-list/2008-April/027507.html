<PRE>Hey Rodrigo,

&gt;<i> Anyway, this would only make sense if freeing is something that happens
</I>&gt;<i> enough to
</I>&gt;<i>  justify the extra work.
</I>
I don't think freeing would happen often enough.  I'm actually more
concerned about the impact of the write barrier I'd need for the
hazard pointer, which would be used every time a slot is fetched from
a RGCTX.

&gt;<i> I was thinking more about collections. Do interfaces have a rgctx too?
</I>
No.  I'm not sure what I'd put into the RGCTX of an interface, anyway.
 What do you have in mind?

&gt;<i> I expected that for F# sharing would have saved some overall time since JIT
</I>&gt;<i> activity is a lot smaller.
</I>
I had hoped for that, too, but it's not there.  Not that I'm terribly
unhappy, though - I saw generic sharing as mainly a memory
optimization.

&gt;<i> By the way, talking about the F# case, generic sharing compiles 27% less
</I>&gt;<i> methods, but only reduces
</I>&gt;<i>  the compiled code size by 6%. These numbers seen odd to me. Is generic code
</I>&gt;<i> really that
</I>&gt;<i> smaller than non-generic or is the added code for sharing support that
</I>&gt;<i> result on these numbers?
</I>
I'll look into it in more detail, but it seems that generic methods
are usually very short, more so than non-generic methods.  And we do
generate code that's a bit longer, but not by much.

Mark
