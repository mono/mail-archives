<PRE>Pash - <A HREF="http://pash.sourceforge.net/">http://pash.sourceforge.net/</A>

PowerShell open source cross-platform reimplementation.
About the name

Pash = PoSH (PowerShell) + bash (one of the Unix shells)
Goals

The main goal is to provide a rich shell environment for other operating
systems as well as to provide a hostable scripting engine for rich
applications. The user experience should be seamless for people who are used
to Windows version of PowerShell. The scrips, cmdlets and providers should
runs AS-IS (*if they are not using Windows-specific functionality*). The
rich applications that host PowerShell should run on any other operating
system AS-IS. Secondary goal: the scripts should run across the machines and
different OS's seamlesly (but following all the security guidelines).
Environment

The current implementation of Pash is written using pure .Net 2.0. It
compiles on VS 2008 as well as on Mono. So all the developers can choose the
environment that fits their needs and preferences. The produced assemblies
can be executed &quot;right out of the box&quot; on Windows, *Linux, Mac (or
others)*&lt;<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html">http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html</A>&gt;without
any additional recompilation.
*Note:* for Windows Mobile and Windows CE the produced code should be
recompiled against the .NET Compact Framework.
Progress

You're welcome to get the source code and contribute to the Pash public
effort @ *<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pash*&lt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/pash">http://sourceforge.net/projects/pash*&lt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/pash</A>&gt;.


~50% of public PowerShell classes defined.

~40% of framework functionality operational.
