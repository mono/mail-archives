<PRE>Ok, so here's the latest and greatest.

I've attached a new patch for the managed SHA1 implementation. One loop is
fully unrolled (InitialiseBuffer), one is partially unrolled (FillBuff) and
i rolled up the SHA1 calculations as much as i think is possible. This means
the cs file has gone from 500 lines to 330 lines. This should make JITing
faster, which was one concern raised earlier. The reason for leaving
InitialiseBuffer unrolled is that it gave a fairly dramatic increase in
speed. Also, it's quite short as compared to the other two methods, so there
wouldn't be a huge LOC saving if i rolled it up, but there would be a
noticeable perf. loss.

Now, performance! The attached testbench.cs file can be compiled and run by
itself. It will then print out timing for the SVN-head version of the SHA1
algo and the enhanced version of the algo. The results i've gathered so far
are:

Core Duo @ 1.86GHz
SVN     : 8004ms
Enhanced: 6007ms
*1.33x faster*

Core 2 Duo @ 2.40GHz
SVN     : 6062ms
Enhanced: 3945ms
*1.53x faster*

Finally, a version of the above code where all the loops are fully unrolled
is only about 1.06x faster, so the perf loss in rolling up those two loops
is fairly negligible.

Let me know your thoughts on this,

Alan.
