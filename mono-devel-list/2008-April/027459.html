The behavior you're describing doesn't happen for built-in value types 
that C# knows implicitly, only structure types.  In particular:

If you try to compile this:

public void foo ( int i )
{
   if ( i == null )
   {
     doSomething();
   }
}

you get a warning that the comparison is always true.  If you switch to 
!=, you get two warnings: one that the comparison is always false, and a 
second that doSomething() is unreachable.

However, if you compile this:

public void foo ( DateTime dt )
{
   if ( dt == null )
   {
     doSomething();
   }
}

you get no warning.  I'm not 100% sure what's going on, but I read over 
the C# spec on comparison operators, I can take a guess.  It seems that, 
because DateTime doesn't have an explicit operator== defined for Object, 
the compiler resolved the operation to Object.operator==(Object, Object) 
and upcasts DateTime to the base Object.  With the built-in C# value 
types, the language spec is explicit about which comparisons are valid 
and which are not, but DateTime (and Rectangle and others) are custom 
types, so they do not behave the same.

I'm not arguing that this is the best behavior, but it does seem to 
logically fall out of the way the spec defines the operator resolution 
process.
