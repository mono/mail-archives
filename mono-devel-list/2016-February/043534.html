<PRE>This may not be the first time this question has been asked, but here
goes...

I've been trying to understand the state of WCF over any SSL-encrypted
transport. Specifically I want to be able to write Linux client
applications in Mono which talk to Windows enterprise services in .NET
using WCF over TLS-encrypted transport (session based or message based).

Using Mono to Mono over the Tcp transport seems to work but I need to do
Mono to .NET.

Looking at the Dotnet Foundation site, they seem to only be part of the way
through WCF and don't seem to have any plans for the service side (yet).
WCF development in Mono seems to have switched over to moving the Dotnet
Foundation code in.

My question is whether the stopping of secure WCF was due to

1. Lack of interest
2. Looking forward to seeing the .NET move to open source solve much of this
3. Facing an overwhelming amount of code to implement along with an
overwhelming amount of Wireshark-driven reverse engineering of encrypted
traffic
4. Facing patent or license issues with #3.
5. Some combination of the above.

My motive for asking this is whether there is even some part of
implementing secure WCF that may be within a month or two worth of
concerted effort by a skilled and motivated developer.
