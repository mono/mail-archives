Mono has been ported to run on AIX internally at IBM. The last news I
have is that they are waiting on the lawyers to give the ok to
distribute the changes. I'm sure that your feedback here (and maybe more
feedback to the IBM people directly) would help to make the process
faster:)

it looks like that IBM people have finish the porting?
Is it true? If so, how can I contact IBM people to get help?

Thank you!

Subject: Anyone knows that deos it mean&#163;&#191;

Hi all,
I tried to port mono to aix, and I search it on google, and found the following infos.
Does anyone understand the point 1,2 mean?

&quot;If you want to try to port Mono to AIX, you would probably want to:

1.Turn on the manual checking of dereferences in Mono, as AIX keeps the page at address zero mapped, preventing a whole class of errors from being caught. I forget the name of the define, but it was introduced some six months ago.

2.You would have to make sure that your signal handlers work, and that exception unwinding works on your platform.

The rest is probably replacing a few Posix functions with some AIX equivalents, but if you get the two above working, you would likely have a working Mono installation. But neither one of those tasks is easy.&quot;

Thank you very much!
