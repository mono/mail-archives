<PRE>I've been playing with Nginx along with Mono FastCGI but I don't have any
live sites using it at the moment. I do have a PHP site running on Nginx
and it can handle more many more simultaneous requests compared to Apache
and mod_php.

As far as I know, nginx was designed from the ground-up to handle large
amounts of traffic. It has some options for caching, so using its cache
along with output caching in your ASP.NET site should help with scaling.
Once you start using nginx's cache, cached pages won't even send a request
to Mono, they'll be served straight out of RAM (which will give you a
massive boost in terms of performance).

I like Cherokee more than Nginx, but I've been moving away from it since
development seems very slow these days and there's a number of bugs that
have been around for a while. To me, Nginx was the second best, but its
development is very constant and its market share keeps growing.
