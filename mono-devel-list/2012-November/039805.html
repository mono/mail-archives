<PRE>

In case anyone was interested in this thread, there was a fix much 
simpler than adding policy files: runtime mapping.

So, this is very handy to know:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is indeed a challenging question.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When Microsoft runs the &quot;gacutil&quot; command, once per version and lists a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> single assembly, it looks really like the equivalent of Mono being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> installed in separate prefixes, it is almost as if none of the different
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> versions are aware of the other assembly versions installed in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but at runtime it acts like if it had policy files (to redirect
</I>&gt;<i> load requests of old versions of DLLs to load new versions). But I don't
</I>&gt;<i> find their policy files... So I'm not sure how they do it. (Because I
</I>&gt;<i> tested installing a FooLib2.0 in the GAC, create a BarProgram that links
</I>&gt;<i> to a it, and then replace FooLib2.0 with FooLib3.0 in the GAC, and
</I>&gt;<i> there's no automatic redirection, a FileNotFoundException is thrown...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The first question is whether there is a workaround that will work for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you, or other developers in your situation, because that seems like an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unobtrusive way of solving this problem, without making changes that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would affect too many parts of the code base.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would have hoped that by installing only the profile I'm interested in
</I>&gt;<i> (via --with-profile2=no --with-profile4=yes --with-profile4_5=no when
</I>&gt;<i> calling autogen.sh) worked, but given the above doesn't work neither in
</I>&gt;<i> .NET or Mono (no automatic redirection even when there are no other
</I>&gt;<i> versions of the library).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I guess the real workaround is just making sure there are no
</I>&gt;<i> libraries linked against different .NET versions... Which is especially
</I>&gt;<i> hard to do when you're consuming things out of your control (like
</I>&gt;<i> libraries from nuget, which is our case; but oh well, at least we have
</I>&gt;<i> the sources and can recompile, otherwise IL replacement would have been
</I>&gt;<i> much harder/cumbersome...).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The second question is whether it would be enough to provide a policy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> file that forwards 3.5 requests to 4.0 requests.  Like we did for Gtk#
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's interesting, I had already discarded the idea because .NET
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't seem to do this. For Gtk# it makes (made) sense because having
</I>&gt;<i> different versions of it installed at the same time would not make much
</I>&gt;<i> sense*, but in this case it makes sense: what if both the program and
</I>&gt;<i> the lib are compiled against the 2.0 profile (and thus the mono
</I>&gt;<i> executable loads the 2.0 runtime by default when being invoked), but
</I>&gt;<i> policy files define it should load a 4.0 lib, then there is a problem...
</I>&gt;<i> unless, there is a way to blacklist this scenario?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, and I just looked on &lt;assemblyRedirect&gt; docs, and it seems there is
</I>&gt;<i> a way: the &quot;appliesTo&quot; attribute [1], right? Should I go ahead to try to
</I>&gt;<i> implement this fix?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regardless, this would not fix the fact gacutil returns all versions of
</I>&gt;<i> the libraries. I guess the correct fix for this is to change this folder
</I>&gt;<i> structure:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> $prefix/lib/mono/gac
</I>&gt;<i>                     \_ S.R.Serialization
</I>&gt;<i>                            \_ 2.0.0.0__d39084jdijc39993
</I>&gt;<i>                            \_ 4.0.0.0__b77a5c561934e089
</I>&gt;<i>                     \_ ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> $prefix/lib/mono/gac
</I>&gt;<i>                     \_ 4.0
</I>&gt;<i>                           \_S.R.Serialization
</I>&gt;<i>                                  \_ 4.0.0.0__b77a5c561934e089
</I>&gt;<i>                           \_ ...
</I>&gt;<i>                     \_ 2.0
</I>&gt;<i>                           \_S.R.Serialization
</I>&gt;<i>                                  \_ 2.0.0.0__d39084jdijc39993
</I>&gt;<i>                           \_ ...
</I>&gt;<i>                     \_ ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then, make gacutil point to 4.x by default, and provide convenience
</I>&gt;<i> scripts like &quot;gacutil2&quot; that call it with the --gacdir argument to point
</I>&gt;<i> to 2.0?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess you are going to ask me what would that fix apart from being
</I>&gt;<i> closer to .NET, and I would agree, but nevertheless still interested in
</I>&gt;<i> what you think about this approach.
