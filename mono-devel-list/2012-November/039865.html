This was never questioned.

No explanation on why the patch worked was given. &quot;It improves stability&quot;
was the closest I got. Given the patch was vouched by the
previous maintainer
of that code base it was merged.

A deadlock on the code was found, so I reverted it. Greg is free to do a
pull request on an patch that fixes the deadlock and has a proper
explanation.




&gt;<i> You appear to be saying that:
</I>&gt;<i>  - patches are applied without discussion, and without adequate
</I>&gt;<i> justification on the ticket (were they checked in against a ticket?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The patch was discussed ad-nausea on this mailing list and on the github
pull request. You can look for both, both happened in the public.



&gt;<i>  - patches were reverted without any discussion with the author (was THAT
</I>&gt;<i> against a ticket?)
</I>

Bad patches are reverted. There was no ticket, just a pull request on
github. Greg's test could not be reproduced outside of his environment.



&gt;<i> What is the process supposed to be? IS there a process?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Good code shaped in proper patches go in. Bad code goes out. It is that
simple.


Isn't this concerning?  TCP/IP performance and async IO is rather important
&gt;<i> to anyone doing server apps.
</I>


I have no idea on what you're talking anymore. That there are bugs, or that
I broken patch was merged in?
