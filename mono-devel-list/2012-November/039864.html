<PRE>I don't buy it.  You knew who it was from.

If there were issues with justification in the documentation with the 
original patch set, surely that should be dealt with at the time it was 
pulled in?

You appear to be saying that:
  - patches are applied without discussion, and without adequate 
justification on the ticket (were they checked in against a ticket?)
  - patches were reverted without any discussion with the author (was 
THAT against a ticket?)

What is the process supposed to be? IS there a process?

Isn't this concerning?  TCP/IP performance and async IO is rather 
important to anyone doing server apps.

</I>&gt;<i> The original patch did not say what it did fix, so there was not much to discuss.
