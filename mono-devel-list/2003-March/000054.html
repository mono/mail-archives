&gt;<i> How is the Native Win32 version of Mono coming along?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
As of right now, I have been able to build the mono/mcs 0.22 releases
that do not need cygwin's dll's  Of course, I think we've already been
able to do this.

However, for some reason, there are some parts of MCS I *can't* build
with csc.  Namely most of nunit fails, as well as the LDAP libraries.
I have some patches that work around this, but it isn't elegant.

I am also building against the dropline.net GTK+ distribution.  Now
there, I can either make mono-win32 dependent on their dist (which is
up-to-date glib/gtk 2.2), or just bundle the DLLs I use in the installer.

&gt;<i> We need a standard set of registry keys.  Should we use what Gert Driesen
</I>&gt;<i> proposed?
</I>
Those seem fine.  Also, would anyone be willing to put the mono/mcs
bins on the system PATH?  The only issue I see are some programs aren't
drop in replacements for the Win32 versions yet...

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can you provide provide us with the goodies, such as, details, pathces,
</I>&gt;<i> source code, binaries, etc...?  I'm sure others are interested in what you
</I>&gt;<i> have been working on...
</I>
I have 4 patches.  Most right now remove things from the MCS build,
since they seem to be broken under csc.  There are a few fixes that are
real.  I'll push those as soon as I clean up the patches.

But for a heads up, debug-jit.c won't build if on Win32, since wthat
file doesn't pull in PLATFORM_WIN32 from config.h.  This leads to a
problem in debug.h.  This is a &quot;simple, must-fix issue&quot;

The mcs/class/library.build is missing Npgsql.  That's an easy add.

The last, and the one I haven't tested hardcore yet, is adding
-mms-bitfields to the build args.  This will allow &quot;full&quot; compatability
with the MSVC compiler.  The downside is that you're now locked into
either using mingw or MSVC IIRC.  Also, this can be a &quot;win&quot; if I can
get libmono building as a dll.  For some reason, I'm not getting one.
That's something I need to look into.

As for registry keys, I know where to add a runtime check for them.  We
just need to agree on an install layout of sorts.  Since mono can
support looking for the libs elsewhere, I say put the DLL's off the
path, and set a reg key so mono/mint can find them.  Then put the exe's
onto the system path.

The last thing I'd like to see is to split the mono runtime from the
headers for development/mono embedding.  Whether or not that is a good
idea is another story...

Mark
