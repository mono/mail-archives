What are the steps you are using to compile Mono without cygwin?  I have
been very interested in compiling Mono using MSVC.

Is there a Nant build file for this?

Thanks
Reggie

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How is the Native Win32 version of Mono coming along?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As of right now, I have been able to build the mono/mcs 0.22 releases
</I>&gt;<i> that do not need cygwin's dll's  Of course, I think we've already been
</I>&gt;<i> able to do this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, for some reason, there are some parts of MCS I *can't* build
</I>&gt;<i> with csc.  Namely most of nunit fails, as well as the LDAP libraries.
</I>&gt;<i> I have some patches that work around this, but it isn't elegant.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am also building against the dropline.net GTK+ distribution.  Now
</I>&gt;<i> there, I can either make mono-win32 dependent on their dist (which is
</I>&gt;<i> up-to-date glib/gtk 2.2), or just bundle the DLLs I use in the
</I>installer.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We need a standard set of registry keys.  Should we use what Gert
</I>&gt;<i> Driesen
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposed?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Those seem fine.  Also, would anyone be willing to put the mono/mcs
</I>&gt;<i> bins on the system PATH?  The only issue I see are some programs
</I>aren't
&gt;<i> drop in replacements for the Win32 versions yet...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Can you provide provide us with the goodies, such as, details,
</I>pathces,
&gt;<i> &gt; source code, binaries, etc...?  I'm sure others are interested in
</I>what
&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have been working on...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have 4 patches.  Most right now remove things from the MCS build,
</I>&gt;<i> since they seem to be broken under csc.  There are a few fixes that
</I>are
&gt;<i> real.  I'll push those as soon as I clean up the patches.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But for a heads up, debug-jit.c won't build if on Win32, since wthat
</I>&gt;<i> file doesn't pull in PLATFORM_WIN32 from config.h.  This leads to a
</I>&gt;<i> problem in debug.h.  This is a &quot;simple, must-fix issue&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The mcs/class/library.build is missing Npgsql.  That's an easy add.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The last, and the one I haven't tested hardcore yet, is adding
</I>&gt;<i> -mms-bitfields to the build args.  This will allow &quot;full&quot;
</I>compatability
&gt;<i> with the MSVC compiler.  The downside is that you're now locked into
</I>&gt;<i> either using mingw or MSVC IIRC.  Also, this can be a &quot;win&quot; if I can
</I>&gt;<i> get libmono building as a dll.  For some reason, I'm not getting one.
</I>&gt;<i> That's something I need to look into.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As for registry keys, I know where to add a runtime check for them.
</I>We
&gt;<i> just need to agree on an install layout of sorts.  Since mono can
</I>&gt;<i> support looking for the libs elsewhere, I say put the DLL's off the
</I>&gt;<i> path, and set a reg key so mono/mint can find them.  Then put the
</I>exe's
&gt;<i> onto the system path.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The last thing I'd like to see is to split the mono runtime from the
</I>&gt;<i> headers for development/mono embedding.  Whether or not that is a good
</I>&gt;<i> idea is another story...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mark
