<PRE>Hi Jerome!

&gt;<i>     Here are two patches for remoting. The first (20030315) has already
</I>been posted,
&gt;<i> I'm reposting it as i don't know if it has not been commited because of a
</I>bug, or because
&gt;<i>  it has been forgeted :) It adds some missing properties to the TcpChannel
</I>like bindTo or priority.

It is ok to me except for this line in TcpChannel.cs:

+ if(port != 0)
+ _serverChannel = new TcpServerChannel(properties, serverSink);

If port is 0, then a TcpServerChannel must be created, using any free port,
so this condition is not needed.

&gt;<i>     The second one is a fix for the remoting in the current CVS. The
</I>CrossAppDomainChannel
&gt;<i>  has been added to ChannelServices as a standard channel and took the
</I>priority over other
&gt;<i>  channels like TcpChannel. This was leading to a SyncProcessMessage
</I>processing messages
&gt;<i>  on the client side as if they were on the server side.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know if it is best the way to fix this... but all the tests
</I>concerning the remoting part
&gt;<i>  concerning local cross context operations seem to run fine. The remote
</I>ones too.

Do you have a test case for this? I think that the problem is in
CrossAppDomainChannelData. It should contain the process id. When
CrossAppDomainChannel.CreateMessageSink tries to create a message sink from
the channel data it should check both the process id and domain id, because
domain ids are local to the process.

&gt;<i>     The last patch is a small typo fix for the class.h file, a &quot;klass&quot;
</I>instead of &quot;class&quot;... it's messing up
&gt;<i>  the C++ compiler :)
</I>
What's the problem? &quot;class&quot; is not a keyword in C.

&gt;<i> Jerome.
