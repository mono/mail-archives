Hi,

first of all, thanks a lot for trying out the debugger, I really appreciate it a lot if
people try it out and give me some feedback and bug reports :-)

&gt;<i> So, with great anticipation ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> mono /usr/bin/Debugger.exe NAnt.exe -help
</I>
Did you compile NAnt with debugging support ?

I compiled mine with

        $ cd ~/monocvs/mcs/nant/
        $ mcs -g /out:NAnt.exe /recurse:*.cs

&gt;<i> blew up somewhere deep in gtk-sharp (?) with a null reference exception
</I>
Can you please post the full backtrace ?

&gt;<i> Ok. mono /usr/bin/Debugger.exe
</I>&gt;<i> load program and viola, the debugger shows a yellow highlight on the first line
</I>&gt;<i> of source.
</I>
Ok, I suppose that's also NAnt.exe and it stopped in NAnt.cs, line 98 (on the
`if (!project.Run ())` statement), that's what it does for me.

&gt;<i> Step, Step, and then step into the first reference to a system
</I>&gt;<i> type, AppDomain in this case, never to return.  I could break, but have to
</I>&gt;<i> close the session after that.  
</I>
Which method in AppDomain do you mean and did you compile your corlib with debugging
support ?

&gt;<i> Ok, try the same thing from the command line.  I can step and again it goes
</I>&gt;<i> into a loop of some sort when hitting the AppDomain reference.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK, try something simpler, a 10 line program that loads up a DataSet, builds a
</I>&gt;<i> DataTable in memory and calls WriteXml() to save.  This was a simple test that
</I>&gt;<i> already worked (except for writexml not being implemented).  In this case I
</I>&gt;<i> could step a few steps until I called a method on the dataset and then an
</I>&gt;<i> infinite loop.
</I>
Please send me this small test program so I can have a look at it myself.  Which method
did you attempt to call where it crashed ?

&gt;<i> Any suggestions?  The only other possible oddity with my system is that I have
</I>&gt;<i> applied the low latency patches to my kernel, other than that it should be
</I>&gt;<i> pretty stock suse 8.0
</I>
I don't think it's your system which is broken, you just found some bugs in the debugger
which I need to fix.
