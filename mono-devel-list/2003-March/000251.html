<PRE>Hi all,

    Here are two patches for remoting. The first (20030315) has already been posted, I'm reposting it as i don't know if it has not been commited because of a bug, or because it has been forgeted :) It adds some missing properties to the TcpChannel like bindTo or priority.

    The second one is a fix for the remoting in the current CVS. The CrossAppDomainChannel has been added to ChannelServices as a standard channel and took the priority over other channels like TcpChannel. This was leading to a SyncProcessMessage processing messages on the client side as if they were on the server side.

I don't know if it is best the way to fix this... but all the tests concerning the remoting part concerning local cross context operations seem to run fine. The remote ones too.

    The last patch is a small typo fix for the class.h file, a &quot;klass&quot; instead of &quot;class&quot;... it's messing up the C++ compiler :)

Jerome.
