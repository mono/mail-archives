As will all the bug reports, you should provide the needed info to
reproduce the issue easily, just saying something doesn't work without
providing any pointers is not going to magically get people to
investigate the bug. Especially if you had to make changes to the
original sources for them to work, if I want to take at look at the
issue I'd have to spend the time to fix the same bugs you have already
fixed.
If you can't extract a simple test case that reproduces the bug, at the
very least:
1) create a tarball with the needed sources to reproduce and put it
somewhere accessible
2) provide instructuions to follow to reproduce the bug (like, run this
program, than another, see the output I expected is &quot;Duh&quot;, but I got
&quot;Doh&quot; instead etc.)

Thanks.
