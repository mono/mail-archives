Hi Atsushi,
I may have poorly worded the first question. The use of Order to re-order the output of members of an object seems fairly straightforward. Its a good idea too.
My concern is that given it &quot;internal&quot; nature of the property, it cannot be used in an attribute:
     [XmlElement(&quot;element&quot;,Order=4)]...
cannot be used outside of the System.Xml library. Or am I mistaken? Should this property be public?
Secondly, if users find themselves using this property in their code, it will not compile on .NET. Now I'm not saying that that is neccessarily bad, but I think that compatibility is desireable.
This is driven by trying to use serialization to generate WSDLs, order matters. Also since we're on the topic, do you have any idea how attributes could be used to surpress the generation of a collection members top-level element tags?
   &lt;items&gt;&lt;item/&gt;&lt;item/&gt;&lt;/items&gt;
to
   &lt;item/&gt;&lt;item/&gt;
cheers,
erik
PS thanks for the feedback. Any ideas on what such a test case would look like?

Below is a comment I found in XmlSerializer.FillTypeTable:


// Sort the attributes for the members according to their Order

</I>&gt;<i> (MS does something like this).

Yeah, I think you're right. I fixed in cvs.

Hmm... we should dig some directories and add testcases.

Thanks,
Atsushi Eno
