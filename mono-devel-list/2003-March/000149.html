Actually it can produce the following targets:
exe
winexe
library
module

The first three are all assemblies ( library is a dll style assembly not 
a c syle static library ) and module is a netmodule - a sub part of a 
multi-module assembly. I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;true assembly&quot;

&gt;<i> How is the Native Win32 version of Mono coming along?
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>
As of right now, I have been able to build the mono/mcs 0.22 releases
that do not need cygwin's dll's Of course, I think we've already been
able to do this.

However, for some reason, there are some parts of MCS I *can't* build
with csc. Namely most of nunit fails, as well as the LDAP libraries.
I have some patches that work around this, but it isn't elegant.

I am also building against the dropline.net GTK+ distribution. Now
there, I can either make mono-win32 dependent on their dist (which is
up-to-date glib/gtk 2.2), or just bundle the DLLs I use in the installer.

&gt;<i> We need a standard set of registry keys. Should we use what Gert Driesen
</I>&gt;<i> proposed?
</I>
Those seem fine. Also, would anyone be willing to put the mono/mcs
bins on the system PATH? The only issue I see are some programs aren't
drop in replacements for the Win32 versions yet...

&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> Can you provide provide us with the goodies, such as, details, pathces,
</I>&gt;<i> source code, binaries, etc...? I'm sure others are interested in what you
</I>&gt;<i> have been working on...
</I>
I have 4 patches. Most right now remove things from the MCS build,
since they seem to be broken under csc. There are a few fixes that are
real. I'll push those as soon as I clean up the patches.

But for a heads up, debug-jit.c won't build if on Win32, since wthat
file doesn't pull in PLATFORM_WIN32 from config.h. This leads to a
problem in debug.h. This is a &quot;simple, must-fix issue&quot;

The mcs/class/library.build is missing Npgsql. That's an easy add.

The last, and the one I haven't tested hardcore yet, is adding
-mms-bitfields to the build args. This will allow &quot;full&quot; compatability
with the MSVC compiler. The downside is that you're now locked into
either using mingw or MSVC IIRC. Also, this can be a &quot;win&quot; if I can
get libmono building as a dll. For some reason, I'm not getting one.
That's something I need to look into.

As for registry keys, I know where to add a runtime check for them. We
just need to agree on an install layout of sorts. Since mono can
support looking for the libs elsewhere, I say put the DLL's off the
path, and set a reg key so mono/mint can find them. Then put the exe's
onto the system path.

The last thing I'd like to see is to split the mono runtime from the
headers for development/mono embedding. Whether or not that is a good
idea is another story...

Subject: [Mono-devel-list] resources

Hi,

I'm trying to get a resource string from the same assembly that my class
is defined in. This is with a view to implementing some CultureInfo
stuff in corlib.

I converted a string table to a resource with monoresgen, and embedded
it in my test assembly. I think the following lines should be fine to
retrieve a string, but they crash with the exception below. 

The code is:

ResourceManager rm = new ResourceManager(&quot;test.res&quot;, 
Assembly.GetAssembly(this.GetType()));
Console.WriteLine(&quot;got string as: &quot;+ rm.GetString(&quot;en-GB&quot;));

However, it crashes with:

Unhandled Exception: System.NotImplementedException: The requested
feature is not yet implemented
in &lt;0x0002f&gt; 00 System.Reflection.Assembly:GetSatelliteAssembly
(System.Globalization.CultureInfo,System.Version)
in &lt;0x00109&gt; 00 System.Resources.ResourceManager:InternalGetResourceSet
(System.Globalization.CultureInfo,bool,bool)
in &lt;0x000a7&gt; 00 System.Resources.ResourceManager:GetString
(string,System.Globalization.CultureInfo)
in &lt;0x0001d&gt; 00 System.Resources.ResourceManager:GetString (string)
in &lt;0x00087&gt; 00 .restest:.ctor ()
in &lt;0x00024&gt; 00 .restest:Main ()

Is there another way to do this, or do I need to hack on the 'Assembly'
stuff before trying this kind of thing?

Regards,

Lee.

What are the steps you are using to compile Mono without cygwin? I have
been very interested in compiling Mono using MSVC.

Is there a Nant build file for this?

Thanks

Well, I load (or at least try) providers dynamicly based on configuration
file. The code looks like this:

Assembly assembly = Assembly.Load(&quot;System.Data&quot;);
result = (IDbConnection)assembly.CreateInstance(model.ConnectionType);

And it fails to compile with &quot;Cannot find type IDbConnection&quot; error. All I
did though is 'mcs Adaptor.cs'. Is there some special steps that need to be

You need to specify the System.Data assembly on the command line:

mcs -r:System.Data Adaptor.cs

This is needed for any required assemblies other than corlib (mscorlib)
and (possibly?) System.

Now, once library is built where should it be installed (and is there any

IL_006a: clt 
IL_006c: ldc.i4.1 
IL_006d: sub 
versus the csc output:
IL_0068: ldloc.0 
IL_0069: ldloc.0 
IL_006a: clt.un 
IL_006c: ldc.i4.0 
IL_006d: ceq 

The output from the ms runtime when running the code compiled by mcs
is the same as with the mono runtime.

Have you tried referencing the System.Data.dll when building?

For example:

mcs MyApp.cs /r:System.Data.dll

Hello,

I just downloaded Mono RPM and instalation was a blast. Moreover most of my
code did got compiled (apart from unpublished
SupportClass.PutElement(IDictionary, key, value) method that MS converted my
java code into)... Anyway, I got stuck on &quot;Cannot find type IDbConnection'
and other System.Data interfaces. Are they not implemented yet or are there
any tricks to get ADO working?

Also, my .NET project is actually an assembly... so what is the story with
assemblies in Mono? There are just 2 targets in mcs: library and module. I
guess I could do for now building as a library and then linking it into test
applications, but still is there a way to create true assemblies and if
there is then how?

Thanks,
Aleksey

The difference between winexe and exe? Under Mono, I would assume that
there is no difference. Under csc, a winexe target will cause the
executing program to &quot;detach&quot; from the command line.

For example, type &quot;notepad.exe&quot; from the Windows command interpreter
(cmd.exe, command.com). Notice that the prompt returns immediately, not
waiting for notepad.exe to exit. That's what a winexe target does.

As for installation, just placing the DLL in the same directory as its
executable should work.

Note that .NET-style shared assemblies (strong-names, etc.) are not
supported by Mono at present. The benefit of this is you don't need to
worry about their complexity. :-)
