<PRE>Hey,

As a follow-up to my question about the way in which Mono handles generic
&gt;<i> types (see &quot;Handling of generics by Mono compiler&quot; on January 15), please
</I>&gt;<i> do
</I>&gt;<i> you know whether the distinction being made by Mono between a generic type
</I>&gt;<i> and the instance type corresponding to it is only of relevance to the
</I>&gt;<i> compiler, or does it have real implications for an application-level
</I>&gt;<i> developer? (This relates to the comment Marek Safar made in the previous
</I>&gt;<i> thread, namely: &quot;Compiled generic types always exist at least as open
</I>&gt;<i> (generic) types, usually TypeContainer(s) but can at the same time exist as
</I>&gt;<i> InflatedTypeSpec too when accesses from within the type.&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That's correct but all this applies to mcs internals only. Mono runtime
handles this differently.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm working on a static analysis tool, and it would arguably be quite
</I>&gt;<i> helpful to blur the distinction between the two for the purposes of writing
</I>&gt;<i> queries over the source code (i.e. query writers shouldn't necessarily have
</I>&gt;<i> to know about compiler internals), but I'm loath to make that change if
</I>&gt;<i> there's a practical difference between the two that's relevant even outside
</I>&gt;<i> the compiler.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That's should be possible when you don't need to define generic types or
handle expressions like
var a = typeof (Foo&lt;,,,&gt;);

Marek
