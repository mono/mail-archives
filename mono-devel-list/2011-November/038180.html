<PRE>Hello there,


I was wanting to review the status of certain items to see if I might be 
able to help contribute in some areas, and found I was having a problem 
with the pages.

It seems the current javascript tree nodes will not expand.  There is no 
error in Google Chrome, or Mozilla Firefox, but in Internet Explorer 
there is a constant error message when trying to use them.

I wasn't sure where to mention it, but as it related to ongoing 
developments, I thought I would ask here if there is a better place for 
me to post this message, or ask it be forwarded on to an appropriate party.


Kind regards,


Scott Price
