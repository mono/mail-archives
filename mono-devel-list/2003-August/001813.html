<PRE>Hi all,

Please let me know what Linux platform you guys are using.  I would like to
test mono on Linux infrequently and would like to choose a platform most
mono-developers are using, since it more or less guarantees that the CVS
tree will not be broken for that platform, and most features work with it.

I would like to do some remoting, services, GTK#, SWT, and SWF.

I would appreciate a quick vote (does not have to be on the mailing list, to
minimize spam...)
