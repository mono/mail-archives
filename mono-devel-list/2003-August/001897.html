<PRE>&gt;<i>It wont ever be a complete Windows.Forms implementation, as most
</I>&gt;<i>Windows.Forms applications today PInvoke into Win32 to use special
</I>&gt;<i>functionality (most third party controls have to talk to Win32,
</I>&gt;<i>due to limited functionality being exposed by System.Drawing and
</I>&gt;<i>System.Windows.Forms).
</I>
I'm not really competent to judge the licensing issues but having written quite a number of c# apps using vs.net, custom controls and now the pnetlib win32 implementation of system.drawing and a number of the key controls - I strongly believe that not basing our implementation on windows messages will *not* hinder broad compatibility, nor completeness.
 
Many of the commercial 3rd party controls currently do make heavy use of the win32 api for a number of reasons. 
However its is rare that end user applications use or need to use interop. As you know on ms runtime you cannot even run an application that does interop from an untrusted location - and this is bound to be tightened even more.
 
Another point worth mentioning is that Avalon (MS next generation UI coming in Longhorn) and its managed interfaces will be integrated as System.Windows.Forms in 1.2 of the Framework. This will be not be compatible with windows messages and applications and controls that use the win32 api for this will not work. Those that stick to using System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms will.
 
To reiterate, I dont represent any of the opinions of the dotGNU guys.
