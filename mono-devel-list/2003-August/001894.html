<PRE>I see this post on the 'what tools' thread

&quot;'#WT' is no longer under &quot;offical&quot; development by the SharpDevelop
crew, but people are still able to &quot;contribute.&quot; 
 
That's Open-Source talk for &quot;dead project&quot;; had it many contributors I
have no doubt that the SharpDevelop team would've just dropped it
without a word to the mailing list otherwise. 
 
Thus, I sincerely doubt that SharpDevelop is going to hit Linux unless
Portable.NET has some powerful Winforms implementation or Mono's WINE
library has some magic up its sleeve. &quot;

Is this true? It's very disappointing since #WT was the best choice that
I could see.
