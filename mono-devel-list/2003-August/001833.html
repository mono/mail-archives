<PRE>hi,

i don't want to further any sort of editor war, but i have recently
converted from vi to scite for many if not all things. i find the syntax
highlighting, folding (on braces as well as region tags) and even (if
somewhat primitive - we need a c# API file for scite!) code completion
to be very useful in my c# hacking as of late. in addition, you can even
build simple things directly from the editor. it is perhaps not an IDE
in the sense of managing large projects with lots of files but for
editing a single file (or a few), writing unit tests or just looking at
code i find it to be very useful. i must admit, i was a long time komodo
user as well (which also implements the scintilla texteditor component)
so perhaps i am used to and a bit partial to its functionality.

in addition, there are windows and linux binaries which is useful for me
as i (still) use windows at work. the only thing that bugs me is that it
doesn't support document tabs in gtk (linux) mode though it does have
buffers, i just find the windows implementation with tabs better (while
writing this i read on the scintilla page that the 1.54 version supports
tabs in gtk as well, so i take that last part back... :-)

anyways, here is the link:
