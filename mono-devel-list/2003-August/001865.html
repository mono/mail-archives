At the risk of talking about something I have not researched into
detail yet, but have thought about, I will have to look in this in more
detail.
We are talking about attributes at the run time ,based on the IL?

I was thinking about this in the context of porting the pnet runtime to
the gcc. My idea was to embed a good chunk of the runtime as a lib
inside of the target program, or as a lib. This would also include the
attribute handling.

Well, I would start by porting a implementation of the c# attributes to
java. Creating an set of classes to represent them in memory. And then
making some way to instanciate them at start up and run time. 

I would have to look into this in detail. Do you know of any
difficulties that might occur? How important is this for you?
Would you like a more detailed analysis, is it of relevance to the
mission of mono?

ps : 
please feel to ban me from the list for off topic discussion, for
distraction, for  wasting you bytes and time, or for absolutly no
reason at all :)
