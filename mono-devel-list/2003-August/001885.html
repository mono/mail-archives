<PRE>I wish I could by I have only 24 hours every day :) Also the problem is 
that in GTK#
case there is a script that does wrapping. After that porting practicaly 
any GTK
library become a trivial task. Ok, may be not trivial in some cases but 
simple task.
Moreover, this approach gurantees that GTK# would be as fresh as GTK (at 
least
while GTK API does not chage dramaticaly).
As far as I can understand in wx.NET case there is no &quot;script&quot; to do 
wrapping.
Thus there are a lot of manual work. And it's clear that the wx.NET 
would not be able
to pick up the latest and greatest wxWindows quickly. Since I have some 
expirience
with wxWindows API I have to say that creating wrapper script would much 
more
difficult than doing one for GTK because wxWindows API is less consistent.

And probably it's off-topic for this discussion but I would like to say 
how amazed  I am
with GTK#! Writing big complex GTK/GNOME projects became much more simple
task now. Thanks to everyone involved for Mono and GTK#!
