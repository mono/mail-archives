<PRE>&gt;<i> El jue, 28-08-2003 a las 19:58, DavidM escribi&#243;:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am trying to get mono.exe to run under Windows XP.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MCS works fine, the exe produced runs just like a .Net app and in fact uses the .Net 1.1 libarary.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mint works fine but Mono does not.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Currently it is returning the following error:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The assembly corlib.dll was not found or could not be loaded.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It should have been installed in the `C:/cygwin/home/Administrator/monodist/lib' directory.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Where is it getting this directory from?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Try setting MONO_PATH environment variable to a list of directories
</I>&gt;<i> suitable for you (ie., c:/where/you/installed/mono).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You may also need to set MONO_CFG_DIR to the 'etc' directory (used to
</I>&gt;<i> locate machine.config) and MONO_CONFIG to the file name located in
</I>&gt;<i> 'etc/config' for runtime configuration file.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -Gonzalo
</I>
I ran into the same problem as DavidM.  After failing to compile using 
mono-build-w32.sh, I took another crack at using the packaged win32 binaries.
This time from a bash prompt.  Gonzalo's recommendations gave me some hope,
but I still couldn't make it find corlib.dll.  Then I remembered seeing
the .exe.sh files in the bin directory.  I was able to run mono.exe.sh 
once I added quotes around the pathnames.  My final working mono.exe.sh 
looks like:

#!/bin/sh
export MONO_PATH=&quot;C:/Program Files/Mono-0.26/lib&quot;
export MONO_CFG_DIR=&quot;C:/Program Files/Mono-0.26/etc/mono&quot;
&quot;C:/Program Files/Mono-0.26/bin/mono.exe&quot; &quot;$@&quot;


The MONO_CFG_DIR gave me a chuckle, after I recovered from panicking.  
mono-0.26-win32 doesn't HAVE an .../etc directory.  Looks like 
0.25 had it, but it's gone now.  Seems to work fine without it so far.
Could someone add the some reference to MONO_PATH in the 
&quot;Installing Mono on Windows, the easy way&quot; section of 
<A HREF="http://monoevo.sourceforge.net/mono-windows/mono-beginning-windows/x53.html">http://monoevo.sourceforge.net/mono-windows/mono-beginning-windows/x53.html</A>



note on why mono-build-w32.sh failed :
on line 49,
cvs -z3 checkout mono || exit -1
it bails if anything out of the ordinary occurs during the CVS checkout.
It shouldn't be a problem for compiling, but this hiccup in the
checkout stops the script promptly:

U libgc/mips_sgi_mach_dep.S
cvs checkout: move away mono/libgc/mips_sgi_mach_dep.s; it is in the way
C libgc/mips_sgi_mach_dep.s
[checkout continues but returns a nonfatal error code]

Two files differentiated only by capitalization. :(
Bad windows XP, bad NTFS.
