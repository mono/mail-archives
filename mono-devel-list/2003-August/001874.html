<PRE>Wondering why no recommendations for WxWindows as a cross-platform kit.

I don't know much about it so I don't think I can recommend it, or not
recommend it.  But it is supposed to be a cross-platform windowing
toolkit.  It seemed to work pretty well on Linux.

</I>What would people recommend for writing portable UI intensive code? 
 
Targets are Windows, Linux (GTK and or Motif)
I would really like to be able to use a good GUI designer (rather than
layout by hand).
I would prefer not to have to install too much stuff on the client
systems (is GTK# a big extra - I have no experience to be able to get
a
feel for it)
I want my app to feel native (i.e  SWT model is preffered over Swing
model)
 
I can see the following choices
 
SWF. Use vs.net to build on windows. It should just run on Linux with
no
recomp. Run using Wine on Linux 
SWF. Use vs.net to build on windows. Run on linux using GTK version of
SWF (it seems that this effort has been stopped - am  I right?)
GTK#. Is there a GUI builder for it? Does it produce native look and
feel on windows?
#wt. Is there a GUI builder for it? I cant see a GTK port nor  Motif
port.
#ifdef. Using GTK# on Linux and SWF on windows. It seems like they are
quite source compatible - but are they for non trivial apps?
(dotgnu SWF libs are like swing so I count them out)
 
Any help or experience (negative or positive) greatly appreciated.
