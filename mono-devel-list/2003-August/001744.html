<PRE>Hello,

The machine running bugzilla.ximian.com started having hardware failures
since last Wednesday, the 7th. Over this weekend, the ops at Ximian were
able to move bugzilla to a new (more healthy) machine and most of the
bug database was migrated without problems. However, changes that went
into the bug database over the weekend were lost.

On the plus side, I think the bugs that were lost are archived on the
mono-bugs list. If you've submitted anything that's important in the
past few days, please check mono-bugs to see if the submission is
archived and resubmit it again to the now healthy bugzilla.

thank you,

Duncan.
