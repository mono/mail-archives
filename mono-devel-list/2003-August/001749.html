<PRE>Hi,

I am trying to develop a remoting client in C that
access a server in MS .net, this is a kind of
prototype my companie requested me

My first plan was to use an already implemented client
in MS .net and load it in C.
Thanks to the answers I got from you I already was
able to load a small dll test, but not the final ones.

Unfortunately the error message is always that it
can&#146;t find the assembly, so I can&#146;t find out why it is
not loading it. In terms of path I think everything is
ok because I can load the simpler in the same
directories&#133;
I am assuming that this dll is using something not yet
implemented in mono, do you agree on that or do you
think I should receive another kind of error message
if that was the case?

Ok, so I pursue my testing not using directly the dll
I had on MS but using the code.
It begins like this:
	RemotingConfiguration.Configure(&#147;app.exe.config&#148;);
	IRemObject remObject =
(IRemObject)RemotingServices.Connect(typeof(IRemObject),
url);

The first method returns the NotImplementeException. 
The Connect needs a registered Channel. I tried with
the ChannelServices.GetChannel but also got the same
exception.

I looked at the samples and the remoting ones are
using the RealProxy class. This one could solve my
problem but it needs the server-side class
MarshalByRefObject, as far as I can understand. I
wanted to use an interface to connect to the server
(as I use with Connect)&#133;

Can anyone help me on this? Or maybe suggest another
way of doing it&#133;

Thanks a lot!
Regards,
Sandra
