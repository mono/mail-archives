<PRE>Thanks for the thoughts

Finally got gtk# running on windows - a challenging and exciting process
:<i>-(
</I>
Its doing a Swing thing - ie not using the OS widgets, it's drawing them
by hand. For me this rules it out. Why, because the widgets will never
behave just like the windows ones. Looking almost exactly like isnt
enough.

I'm pinning my hopes on #wt

Which version of Windows? :-)

Gtk# has a GUI Designer (sort of), through Glade.  There are several
samples of using Glade from Gtk#.  Simplifying, you draw your GUI with
glade, save it to a .glade file, then load the .glade file at runtime to
generate the interface.  Rather nice.

On Windows, GTK+ looks native...as long as you're running Windows XP,
hence the &quot;version of Windows&quot; question.  There's a theme that creates
the Windows-native look, but it requires the theme engine that XP
introduced.  It's included by default with Gtk#, IIRC.

As for SWF on GTK+, I haven't seen much activity with it, so I would
concur that it's currently halted.

I am also unaware of a GUI Designer for #WT, but I'm sure one will be
eventually written as #Develop approaches 1.0.  I'm not sure what
timeframe that is, though.

Which leaves Gtk# and SWF as your current solutions.  I'd suggest Gtk#,
but I may be biased...
