<PRE>Hello,

&gt;&gt;<i> I think it would be worth it to try to remove the reflection overhead,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because it is not just taking some time but also quite some amount of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> additional memory. Personally I would recommend to put the small 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> encodings
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> directly into corelib and the larger and seldom used ones in one or more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> additional assemblies that could be referenced without reflection and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simply
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be deleted when not needed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you point out in one of your emails, I think it is worth fixing the
</I>&gt;<i> code that triggers the culture-dependent string compares in our class
</I>&gt;<i> libraries, they are likely not needed.
</I>
Well, I guess that is more of a sideeffect found in the process looking at 
it. I just did some simple measuring and at least in CPU-Performance the 
Globalization stuff is completely negegible (beyond of what the timer of 
mono --profile can measure). The problem here is more that this code could 
fail on certain locales (in the examples I wrote my guess would be that the 
first one would not work on a turkish locale).

&gt;<i> As for not using reflection, am afraid that even if we removed the use
</I>&gt;<i> of Reflection for the encodings, reflection will end up being triggered
</I>&gt;<i> anyways as too much code in Mono (in addition to standard .NET
</I>&gt;<i> practices) will trigger the reflection bits to be loaded.
</I>
However this could still save most of the runtime initialization cost, which 
is usually even more than the JIT-Time.

&gt;<i> Integrating the most commonly used encodings into corlib sounds like a
</I>&gt;<i> good idea, someone would have to prototype it and measure it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The overhead actually comes mostly from two places:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a) I18N
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> b) Globalisation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> b is triggered because of String handling mistakes within corelib, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> however
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the biggest share in runtime is I18N (see textfile - 78 ms out of 93 ms
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> total app time).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for looking at the problematic sources.    I like the idea of
</I>&gt;<i> fixing these issues, but am not sure that they will have a real effect
</I>&gt;<i> on applications.
</I>
I did some more simple measuring and would expect a nice potential for 
improvement (obviously mostly for small CMD-Apps):
1) I ran mcs.exe --help to display the help of mcs. Virtually 100% of the 
runtime were spent for the Initialization of I18N (obviously this means that 
mono cannot do more detailed measuring with --profile, because mcs should 
need some cycles, too ;)
2) Ran mcs.exe for compiling a simple application. Nearly 25% of the entire 
runtime were spent only for *Initialization* of I18N.

&gt;<i> The globalization code will likely be used shortly after, at least for
</I>&gt;<i> any non-trivial program.
</I>
You're surely right on this one. Also the Globalization overhead is tiny 
compared with I18N.

Greetings
Andreas

P.S. All tests done on Athlon 3500+, Mono 1.1.15, XPx64
