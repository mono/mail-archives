&gt;<i> Hello. Very interesting thread.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It may be a little of topic, but after reading your email I took a closer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; look on the AjaxOS Demo Video (which was very impressive by the way) and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; during that some interesting thoughts come up.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; First of all, I was thinking about the Vision of AjaxOS that all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; applications will become services which are available in the Internet by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using your web browser. This form of application distribution shall lead
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to certain advantages, like updates need only be deployed on the server
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and all user of the app will get them and so on.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But at the end of the Video some guy asked if the AjaxOS Spreadsheet
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; program is able to run macros, which it isn't. Because of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transformation and interaction between the server and the client was way
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to complex since the spreadsheet must be converted back and forth between
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ODF and HTML in the process. In addition, the Applications also don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; really look like native applications, they don't lose their &quot;web-touch&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However I like his ideas and thought to myself, can't we avoid the HTML
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and WWW overhead and make the user experience more &quot;classic&quot; applications
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without losing the advantages?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I mean, why can't I just type /usr/bin/mono
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="mono://whatever.mono-project.com">mono://whatever.mono-project.com</A> into my console and I get the App I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; requested?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is already invented and working with the .NET ClickOnce technology,
</I>&gt;<i> which IIRC doesn't have a port on Mono+Gecko (I only have managed to get
</I>&gt;<i> it working with IE, but perhaps it's an issue very easy to solve).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, I think the most disadvantage of this is security: with web
</I>&gt;<i> browsers you are sure that the most complex code that the web
</I>&gt;<i> application is going to execute is JavaScript (which is very limited)
</I>&gt;<i> and inside the &quot;security sandbox&quot; of the browser (no access to local
</I>&gt;<i> files, no access to other sites different than the one being visited,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.). I am not sure but I think the .NET CAS technology could be used
</I>&gt;<i> to achieve a similar paradigm...
</I>&gt;<i>

Well since Microsoft has that Technology implemented, the security concern can 
be handled.

My guess is that, since the .NET Framework on Windows allows to configurate 
Apps to run under a certain security policy, those distributed Apps will be 
run under a &quot;Sandbox-Like&quot; policy. What I don't know is if and to what point 
those security policies are applicable to Mono. Maybe a similar concept to 
those .NET Framework Configuration Wizzard on Windows could be implemented 
into Mono. And Programs executed within the Mono environment must be run 
under one policy which can be customized by the user to fit his needs.

Kind Regards,
Valentin
