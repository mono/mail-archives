<PRE>Hello. Very interesting thread.

latency escribi&#243;:
&gt;<i> It may be a little of topic, but after reading your email I took a closer look 
</I>&gt;<i> on the AjaxOS Demo Video (which was very impressive by the way) and during 
</I>&gt;<i> that some interesting thoughts come up.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First of all, I was thinking about the Vision of AjaxOS that all applications 
</I>&gt;<i> will become services which are available in the Internet by using your web 
</I>&gt;<i> browser. This form of application distribution shall lead to certain 
</I>&gt;<i> advantages, like updates need only be deployed on the server and all user of 
</I>&gt;<i> the app will get them and so on.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But at the end of the Video some guy asked if the AjaxOS Spreadsheet program 
</I>&gt;<i> is able to run macros, which it isn't. Because of the transformation and 
</I>&gt;<i> interaction between the server and the client was way to complex since the 
</I>&gt;<i> spreadsheet must be converted back and forth between ODF and HTML in the 
</I>&gt;<i> process. In addition, the Applications also don't really look like native 
</I>&gt;<i> applications, they don't lose their &quot;web-touch&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However I like his ideas and thought to myself, can't we avoid the HTML and 
</I>&gt;<i> WWW overhead and make the user experience more &quot;classic&quot; applications without 
</I>&gt;<i> losing the advantages?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I mean, why can't I just type /usr/bin/mono <A HREF="mono://whatever.mono-project.com">mono://whatever.mono-project.com</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> into my console and I get the App I requested?
</I>
This is already invented and working with the .NET ClickOnce technology,
which IIRC doesn't have a port on Mono+Gecko (I only have managed to get
it working with IE, but perhaps it's an issue very easy to solve).

However, I think the most disadvantage of this is security: with web
browsers you are sure that the most complex code that the web
application is going to execute is JavaScript (which is very limited)
and inside the &quot;security sandbox&quot; of the browser (no access to local
files, no access to other sites different than the one being visited,
etc.). I am not sure but I think the .NET CAS technology could be used
to achieve a similar paradigm...

Regards,
