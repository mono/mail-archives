<PRE>The only use I've ever had for edit and continue, which to me, is a very
important use, is in the debugger. I can step through code, find an
error, and quickly replace it immediately, and test the results locally
in that method by stepping back and then forwards again.

Without it, I have to shutdown the entire application, which might have
a large running state to arrive at the bug, and start it again.

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the interpreter would be okay, but for those usage patterns
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I won't implement edit-and-continue ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Like I said, I don't think the option should be discounted out-of-hand.
</I>&gt;<i> Consider the following:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. The interpreter would only be used for the case where the method being
</I>&gt;<i> edited is *currently executing* on some thread.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. The interpreter would be used to take over only that invocation of the
</I>&gt;<i> method. Thus, any lost speed benefits apply only to code within that
</I>&gt;<i> function for the duration of that call. Situations where a single method is
</I>&gt;<i> in a massively long loop and needs to be edited at runtime are more than
</I>&gt;<i> likely corner cases. Yes, I've written them before, but I've used
</I>&gt;<i> edit-and-continue far more often in GUI applications where the broken code
</I>&gt;<i> is, say, a button click handler that gets an item index from the wrong
</I>&gt;<i> place, or doesn't handle a possible null reference. It's certainly true
</I>&gt;<i> that it's no more than a convenience in this situation, but it's a
</I>&gt;<i> convenience that can greatly reduce development time, since you don't have
</I>&gt;<i> to bring the GUI up to the point of the bug every time you make a change to
</I>&gt;<i> the code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Edit-and-continue has never been intended by anyone who has developed it
</I>&gt;<i> to be more than a stopgap measure, a means to test a fix quickly without
</I>&gt;<i> restarting the application. Once the fix has been verified to work, the
</I>&gt;<i> application will inevitably need to be rebuilt at some point. I don't think
</I>&gt;<i> I would feel comfortable using edit-and-continue on a long-running
</I>&gt;<i> application and then running it through to its finish on the &quot;hacked&quot; code.
</I>&gt;<i> I would feel even more uncomfortable running a network server on
</I>&gt;<i> edited-and-continued code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4. The alternative to using an interpreter is very difficult to code. It
</I>&gt;<i> would probably take longer to get right than an entire functional
</I>&gt;<i> interpreter coded from scratch. In essence, it's a choice between having
</I>&gt;<i> the ability to edit methods that are running and not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5. An implementation using an interpreter need not be permanent. It would
</I>&gt;<i> fill an important niche until a developer had the time &amp; expertise to write
</I>&gt;<i> the code to munge the native execution context of the new JIT output.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 6. An implementation using an interpreter would be inherently
</I>&gt;<i> platform-independent, whereas the &quot;ideal&quot; native version would, as far as I
</I>&gt;<i> can tell, tend to be platform-specific. Even if the native version were
</I>&gt;<i> implemented on some platforms, an interpreter-based implementation could be
</I>&gt;<i> a fallback for the alternative on platforms for which it had not yet been
</I>&gt;<i> written.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I also happen to think that it's a little bit arrogant to refuse to
</I>&gt;<i> implement a feature on the basis that some people would use it in a pattern
</I>&gt;<i> you disapprove of. It would be a little bit like refusing to implement
</I>&gt;<i> intellisense on the grounds that people only use it because they're too
</I>&gt;<i> lazy to memorize the framework.
