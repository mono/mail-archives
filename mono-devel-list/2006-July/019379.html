Hello,

that's not gonna work that easy.

Metadata is not only about the types defined in an assembly, it's also
about the types referenced by that assembly.  The first time a method is
parsed, we resolve all the types referenced by that assembly and add
them to hashtables etc.  When creating the metadata, we also create
TypeRef/TypeSpec entries for them.  So if you parse the same method a
second time, the types previously referenced by that method are still in
the cache and thus your metadata could grow a lot in size if you do that
several times. 

Also, you will run into the problem that not all Expressions/Statement's
in gmcs are safe of being Resolved/Emitted more than once - most of them
will work, but you'll discover side-effects with some of them which have
to be fixed.

There is also the problem of figuring out which methods changed and
which did not.

However, I really like the idea - but I think it'd be a huge task and
require a lot of work.

Btw. you may also find some useful information about edit-and-continue
in Mike Stall's debugger blog:
<A HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/jmstall/default.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/jmstall/default.aspx</A>
just look for edit-and-continue in there.
