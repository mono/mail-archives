I do not think that the new method will add that many entries to make 
this a problem.

</I>Can you give me an example of that? I have no idea what could cause such 
a problem.

&gt;<i> There is also the problem of figuring out which methods changed and

</I>The compiler will be send a source file which will contain only the 
changed methods.

&gt;<i> Btw. you may also find some useful information about edit-and-continue

</I>I am aware of this. Actually, he started writing about Edit and Continue 
because of me :-D

</I>Could you please at least state a few to convince me that this is not 
feasible?
Mind that I do not want to touch mono runtime and mono 
System.Reflection.Emit. I just want be able to quickly produce updated 
assembly given that only bodies of methods can change. I will use cecil 
to do the diffs and I will apply the changes to program running under 
Microsoft runtime.

Thank you very much,
David
