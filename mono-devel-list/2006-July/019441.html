&gt;<i> i'm ahmed faheem, a final year student, Computer &amp; Systems Engineering 
</I>&gt;<i> Dept, Faculty of Engineering, Alexandraia Univ., Egypt.
</I>&gt;<i> my final project team wants to contribute to Mono Project. We are a set 
</I>&gt;<i> of self-motivated people who are very enthusiastic to build a good thing 
</I>&gt;<i> in our final project. So, we want suggestions on how we can contribute. 
</I>&gt;<i> We are ready for a big contribution, one that will affect Mono largely 
</I>&gt;<i> and put it a big step forward.
</I>&gt;<i> we are a team of 6, 4 of us has excellent grades, the rest has &quot;very 
</I>&gt;<i> good&quot; grades, that's like A,B, C grades.
</I>&gt;<i> So, i'm waiting for your suggestions, and then watch those poeple from 
</I>&gt;<i> Egypt.
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks very much

Hi! Thanks very much for your effort!

My personal opinion is that the best priority should be to finish the 
port of MonoDevelop to Windows. I think this goal would make Mono take 
off on many fields (nowadays, it is very difficult to convince people 
about using a multiplatform development tool whose own IDE is not 
multiplatform).

I think that Daniel Morgan is the person who has made the most recent 
efforts for this goal.

Regards.
