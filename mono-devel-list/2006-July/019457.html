I don't want to go to far off topic or speak for the other early
MonoDevelop contributors, but being completely cross-platform was never
a goal.  We mostly wanted a IDE with some basic niceties, and that
supported and integrated with gnome because that is where our interest
lied.  If what is wanted is 100% cross-platform (and open source*) IDE
for mono, there are two options: help System.Windows.Forms to be able
run SharpDevelop eventually, or rewrite the functionality that using
Gnome related libraries provides MonoDevelop.

To date I can't remember anyone even posting a single (reviewable) patch
towards that end, and I am not even sure it would be a huge amount of
work anymore. I would encourage those that have this interest to work
towards it.

Another alternative is to add native support for the msbuild project
format so SharpDevelop/MonoDevelop/XDevelop/Visual Studio can all share
projects in the meantime.

* I think XDevelop is, but it is not open source
