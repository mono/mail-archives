The issue is that the nant source ships binaries that are compiled
against 1.0.3300.0, which is fine because it's important that a program
be able to ship a binary that it has been tested and developed against.

&gt;<i> I discovered the same problem with MonoDevelop, because it ships a

Mike Kestner got around this by using policy assemblies.  He also
updated mono-find-provides for rpm to provide gtk# 2.4 and 2.6 assembly
versions from the gtk# 2.8 rpm.

I ended up having the rpms require &gt;= 1.0.3300.0 as Rafael suggested.

I'm not familiar with debian packaging, but this is how it's been sorted
out with rpm.
