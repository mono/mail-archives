<PRE>We are using the embedding API to run mono plug-ins inside our C++ application for OSX which has been working great.  We&#8217;ve also been putting together an alternate MonoMac based System.Windows.Forms.dll which we would like to get loaded and used any time an assembly needs to use System.Windows.Forms.

I can &#8220;force&#8221; this to work by overwriting the System.Windows.Forms.dll with our custom one in the mono gac, but going that route would force us to distribute a custom mono package to our users which really doesn&#8217;t appeal to me.  As things currently run our users can always get the latest and greatest mono distribution and things continue to work.

I&#8217;ve tried things like creating a custom config file with &lt;bindingRedirect&gt; tags in it and calling
mono_confg_parse(&#8220;path to my config file&#8221;);
and forcing our custom System.Windows.Forms.dll to load before any other assembly is loaded, but when a plug-in is run that was built referencing the mono (or .NET) System.Windows.Forms assembly, the mono debug output tells me that it is loading System.Windows.Forms version 4.0.0.0 from the gac.

I&#8217;ve tried this with 2.8.1 and 2.10 since I noticed the 2.10 release notes has a comment
- Added support for Assembly Remapping

I&#8217;m at a loss on what to try next.
Thanks,
-Steve
