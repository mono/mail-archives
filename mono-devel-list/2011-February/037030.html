<PRE>That's precisely what I have done over and over again (one more time 
after receiving this email).

I use File/Open to open an executable that uses a &quot;statically linked&quot; 
assembly and a bunch of dynamically loaded assemblies.  Then I set up a 
breakpoint right at the beginning of Main().  Then I hit Ctrl-F5 (Run) 
and, voila, the program runs to its completion, showing a help text in 
the program output window in the bottom of MonoDevelop.  The only thing 
that changes if I use &quot;Run/Debug&quot; instead of &quot;Run/Run&quot; is that a window 
flashes by briefly and then the program is done.

By the way, I am using Windows x64 as my platform.  Also, I have noticed 
the weird thing that once I open an executable, the solution browser 
only shows a single source file - and a single class.  I suppose it 
should show all the sources and all the assemblies being used by the 
program?  I don't know if there's a silent assumption somewhere that I 
ought to be using MonoDevelop on Linux?

I've checked and cross-checked that I am compiling with debug info - for 
each assembly, there's a corresponding .mdb file with the same date/time 
as the assembly itself.

I am not saying that this cannot be my fault, but I have tried in many 
ways and many variations - with the result result each time: The 
application runs to its completion without heeding any breakpoints and 
without giving me a chance to step through my code.


Cheers,
Mikael
