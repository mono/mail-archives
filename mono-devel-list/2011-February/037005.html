<PRE>Hi,

Anybody knows of good documentation for the Mono Soft Debugger?  I am 
hacking away on a hobby project that is a console mode debugger, but 
only have the Mono and MonoDevelop sources to guide me.  The 
documentation in Monodoc seems to very incomplete, which is 
understandable given the low number of people that are going to use this 
API.

Especially, I'd like information on how to clean up after the debugging 
session is over.  I seem to get an unhandled exception (due to some Mono 
Soft Debugger code being blocked in a call to Socket.ReadBytes()) no 
matter what I do and it looks bad on the console.  I suspect that this 
exception has gone uncaught in other code, such as MonoDevelop, because 
it appears to occur in a separate thread and GUI apps don't output stuff 
to the console.  Or, alternatively, I am simply not cleaning up and 
shutting down the debug session the way I should do.  That's definitely 
also a possibility.

How do you terminate (prematurely or ultimately) a debug session up 
against Mono.Debugger.Soft.VirtualMachine?  I call vm.Exit(), 
vm.EndLaunch() and vm.CancelConnection(), but I still get an exception.

I wouldn't mind a high-level description of how the soft debugger works 
(beyond that on the Mono website) and how one is supposed to code up 
against it.  I currently progress very slowly because everything is 
trial and error.


Cheers,
Mikael
