<PRE>I am beginning to realize that the project of making a new debugger is 
sort of meaningless.  It turns out, now that I have studied MonoDevelop 
a bit more and done some searches on the Internet, that MonoDevelop 
already supports debugging stand-alone executables.  And that's 
precisely what I am looking for.  I regularly use batch and makefiles 
for my projects and have an excellent editor that I don't want to trade 
in for MonoDevelop, for which reason I am looking for a debugger that 
can handle stand-alone executables.

I just have a single, minor issue that I don't seem capable of solving: 
When I open an application using the Debug/Debug Application menu item, 
it opens the application, runs it immediately and therefore does not 
allow me to set breakpoints and single-step the program.  I have tried 
opening a source file beforehand and setting a breakpoint, but that 
doesn't seem to work either.

Is there a chance that MonoDevelop could be altered so that it set up a 
breakpoint on Main the very moment that the application is loaded?  That 
way, one could debug using MonoDevelop and I could perhaps spend some 
time helping out on MonoDevelop instead of wasting a lot of time on 
reinventing the wheel.

P.S. Should I file this as an enhancement request to MonoDevelop?

Cheers,
Mikael
