</I>
I saw CngAlgorithm and CngAlgorithmGroup, those are only 2 of the 23 
classes I would need (if I counted them right).

&gt;&gt;<i> and reverse engineered some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ECDiffieHellmanCng class functionality where the documentation is not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clear.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;reverse engineered&quot; means a lot of things to different people. Can you
</I>&gt;<i> elaborate on this and ensure it's in compliance with:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Contributing#Important_Rules">http://www.mono-project.com/Contributing#Important_Rules</A>
</I>
In this context I meant trial-and-error and Microsoft documentation, the 
ECDiffieHellmanCng class should just be a wrapper to the native Cng API 
anyway, so I doubt decompilation would help anything. I'll review those 
rules and my code and try to make sure it complies with all the 
requirements.

&gt;&gt;<i> I could send these upstream to Mono, but since there are a lot of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> files to be added, I'd like to know how should I proceed.
</I>&gt;<i> That would be great :) and a patch will be fine (for review). But first
</I>&gt;<i> please read both:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Contributing">http://www.mono-project.com/Contributing</A>
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Coding_Guidelines">http://www.mono-project.com/Coding_Guidelines</A>
</I>
Thank you for the links, I've tried to follow the code style I have seen 
in other Mono classes, but I'll go through the guidelines while 
reviewing the code myself.

&gt;&gt;<i> should I write some tests before they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can be accepted?
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, definitively! Unit tests (nunit) are required to ensure it works
</I>&gt;<i> correctly (on both MS and Mono runtimes) and ensure no future
</I>&gt;<i> regressions.
</I>
Ok, I'll have to look into this after I've finished the required 
functionality in the code.

&gt;&gt;<i> Does Novell have some copyright policy I should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consider? Releasing them with the MIT license shouldn't be a problem.
</I>&gt;<i> Our class libraries are MIT.X11 licensed, so as long as you can release
</I>&gt;<i> this code with that license there should not be any problem.
</I>
Ok.

I also have some questions I might need advice with. The Cng classes 
have functions and properties like 
<A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb298399.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb298399.aspx</A> that return a 
SafeNCryptSecretHandle. This should be a handle to the native 
cryptography API, but it's completely useless in Mono. Since 
SafeNCryptSecretHandle is not implemented, I just dropped those methods 
completely. How should I proceed in this kind of case?

Another thing I had to do is that I am throwing exceptions in case 
someone tries persistent key storage, all the keys in my implementation 
are ephemeral. (but can be serialized into a file and made persistent 
that way) Since Mono is not using the real key storage of .NET I suppose 
this should be ok?
