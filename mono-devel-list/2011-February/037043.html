<PRE>Hi,

I have some unsubmitted modifications to mixed-mode support I made about 
a year ago. I should revise them and those may improve mixed-mode support.

I haven't had time to sort out the verifier conflict but that should be 
possible and hopefully easy to resolve.

My preferred way would be to call exports that Windows calls:
- _CorValidateImage on image load
- _CorImageUnloading on image unload
- _CorExeMain instead of exe entry point
- _CorDllMain instaad of dll entry
- the C runtime (not the OS) should also call CorExitProcess on normal 
termination (exit)

All of the above functions are (vaguely, from the wrong perspective) 
documented on MSDN.

This would render MonoFixupCorEE unnecessary.

I also planned to get rid of MonoFixupExe  and drop support for 
mixed-mode assemblies by using mono.exe and introduce a loader that 
would call CreateProcess on the managed (may be mixed-mode) .exe, inject 
a loader .dll (or a custom mscoree.dll) by modifying IAT, remove IL-only 
flag so that the OS loader will not load MS.NET mscorlib.dll, and do 
inicialization in that loader .dll called by OS loader. This would not 
affect functionality of mono.dll just would not fixup mscoree.dll by 
default that also would play more nicely with standalone verifier, 
dumper, etc. tools and CoreCLR.

I also have the impression that implementing .NET Framework 
functionality in Wine may not be the right architecture. Ideally those 
belong to Mono. Since I know that Mono does not accept GPL to runtime 
(requires MIT X11 license or special permissions to Novell; althoug is 
licensed under GPL) and Wine prefers GPL this may not be suitable.

Wine loader should call mscoree.dll just like Windows loader does 
(system32\mscoree.dll is hardcoded, cannot use your own).

If you prefer to keep mscoree.dll code in Wine, then I belive that Wine 
mscoree.dll should load mono.dll (as it already does) and forward the 
above five basic exports to mono.dll and implement other exports on its 
own by calling native Mono API.

</I>&gt;<i> These two changes had the combined effect of getting me to think about

</I>&gt;<i> code and how it works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apparently the native code in a mixed-mode assembly works like a
</I>&gt;<i> p/invoke, except that the invoked function is inside the assembly
</I>&gt;<i> instead of a library export. Before we can call that code, we need the
</I>&gt;<i> assembly to be loaded using the OS loader, so it's linked properly.
</I>&gt;<i> But because all assemblies link to mscoree.dll and execute _CorExeMain
</I>&gt;<i> or _CorDllMain (and the OS does that itself in recent Windows
</I>&gt;<i> versions), that would load MS .NET. So Mono loads mscoree.dll itself
</I>&gt;<i> on Windows before it loads any assemblies, and hooks the mscoree
</I>&gt;<i> functions so they go to implementations in libmono.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This makes sense on Windows, but it's no good on Wine, where
</I>&gt;<i> mscoree.dll loads Mono. I can't work sanely on the unmanaged API in
</I>&gt;<i> Wine if it's going to be bypassed by Mono half of the time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But we still need Mono to load the assemblies using the OS loader so
</I>&gt;<i> it can invoke native methods.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I would like to propose that both mixed-mode behaviors (using the
</I>&gt;<i> OS loader and hooking mscoree) be default off but optionally activated
</I>&gt;<i> by embedding API calls (which Wine would call), or switches (which
</I>&gt;<i> mono_main would translate into the appropriate embedding calls). That
</I>&gt;<i> is, we would have a function that, if called very early on, would load
</I>&gt;<i> mscoree.dll and do the hooking, and set a flag so that Mono tries to
</I>&gt;<i> load assemblies using the OS loader. We would have another,
</I>&gt;<i> independent function that only sets that flag, which Wine would use.
</I>&gt;<i> (I think we'll also need access to something like
</I>&gt;<i> mono_image_open_from_module_handle, so we can give Mono the handle to
</I>&gt;<i> an already-loaded exe file in _CorExeMain.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does this seem doable?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once that's done, I'd like to get Wine's mscoree.dll to a point where
</I>&gt;<i> it's on par with Mono's mixed-mode assembly support. What is that
</I>&gt;<i> support currently used for, and what are you using to test it? AFAICT
</I>&gt;<i> an ordinary assembly written in managed c++ and compiled with VS will
</I>&gt;<i> always fail to load in Mono.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you have any sense of what's required to make assemblies linking
</I>&gt;<i> msvcrt (my eventual goal) work? I have so far been unable to create a
</I>&gt;<i> build of Mono that can call native functions without hooking mscoree,
</I>&gt;<i> so I can't really tell what's going on. There was speculation in a
</I>&gt;<i> Wine bug that _CorDllMain needs to call some entry points in
</I>&gt;<i> assemblies, named PostDllMain and PostRawDllMain, but given that they
</I>&gt;<i> were actually fields containing.. some number.. maybe it was an RVA?..
</I>&gt;<i> I wasn't sure what to do with that.
</I>&gt;<i>
