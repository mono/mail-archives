Subject: Re: [Mono-dev] Olive Status

Oh, ok. It is indeed outdated (it has been unchanged for 3 years).
We indeed have stubs for WF4 in olive module since it is smaller than
WF3 and easier, but right now the mono team has no plan to work on it.
So it is left as &quot;contribution welcome&quot; area.

IMO I don't think we should dare explicitly state that the wiki page is outdated on that page itself (since there are indeed some code that used to work and some people might want to continue hacking these old stuff).
It could be done after someone actually started WF4 hacking as an alternative effort.
