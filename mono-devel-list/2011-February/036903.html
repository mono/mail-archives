<PRE>&#65279;Hi All,
I would like to submit a patch for this bug: <A HREF="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=580189">https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=580189</A>
I&#8217;m using sizeof(T) in the SharpDX project (A fully managed .NET DirectX API <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/sharpdx/">http://code.google.com/p/sharpdx/</A>) to be able to write efficiently structured data in memory. This instruction is not supported by C# but is a valid CLI (and can be in fact generated by C++/CLI). The impacted file is mono/mono/method-to-ir.c, in the mono_method_to_ir.

Because some people are using SharpDX with Mono (and would like to use it with Unity), I found this bug (among some others) in Mono that is quite annoying to go further.

Be indulgent for this patch, as I have just entered the mono source code this afternoon, and I&#8217;m not sure the patch is enough safe/correct, as the whole generic handling is still obscure to me.

At least, this patch is solving my specific problem ,and I&#8217;m able to run SharpDX samples smoothly! :)

Also, as a very new developer, I would like to make just a remark about the building process: I&#8217;m not hugely familiar with git, but It seems that default config for line termination is &#8220;autoclr&#8221;... which is breaking autogen.sh pre-build. This was annoying, as it is not stated in the mono-compiling for windows doc

Thanks!
