<PRE>Hi,

I need to create excel files from mono under Linux, and so I tried
two approaches:

1. Using the library EPPlus which works great under .net but not mono (I
tried 2.6.7 and later 2.10) although as far as I can tel from Moma the only
problem is the crypto module since it P/Invokes, It crashes in the library
zipsharp in System.IO.Packaging... the question here is how do I debug into
the mono library to discover what exactly is going on in order to fix the
library or patch the framework or whatever? the tutorials says that after I
GIT the source, the make process could take 45 mns to 2hrs .... so I am
kinda lost here! what exactly is the best route to debug the framework
library... I could try to copy the files into my solution... but that could
get tedious in case of lots of dependencies so what is the best route to
take?

2. I used CLI_UNO which works nicely in console, but when run from mono
2.6.7 webapp in xsp2, it raises exceptions and fails
&quot;Ambiguous matching in method resolution&quot; while setting the Thread culture
(which happens outside my code)
 that happens even when xsp is run with sudo.... are there any knows
limitations between xsp and console that could prevent the code from
running?
In case it matters to someone, here is the line that crashes:
    componentLoader = (XComponentLoader)multiServiceFactory.createInstance
(&quot;com.sun.star.frame.Desktop&quot;);


Another question: Are there any known plans by anybody to port mono 2.10 to
Ubuntu or the easiest way to stay up-to-date is to move to Opensuse?

Thanks a lot for the help....
