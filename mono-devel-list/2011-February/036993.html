mono 2.10 works fine on ubuntu

See my thread here on how to compile it yourselfs (just replace 2.8 with 
2.10):
<A HREF="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1591370">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1591370</A>
It takes about 30 minutes to 1 hour on a moderately modern computer.
An ideal in-between supper task.

I also tried EPPLUS on Linux several months ago, and there seems to be a 
bug in mono, something with the using directive and disposing too soon 
(on mono 2.6.7).
As I didn't have 2.8 then (freshly installed ubuntu on a new computer), 
I haven't filed a bug report, since it might have been already corrected.
It works fine on Windows, though.

You can also try
<A HREF="http://excellite.codeplex.com/">http://excellite.codeplex.com/</A>

It also works fine outside of Silverlight, when you add the following 
references:
PresentationCore
PresentationFramwork
WindowsBase

See my fixes here:

It's the only FOSS .NET library I've found that's able to write .XLS 
files in BIFF format that can be opened with Excel 2010.
I don't know whether it runs on mono.
If you try, let me know the result.

I also have a console application for ExcelLite, if you want it, let me 
know (might save you 30 mins.).

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I need to create excel files from mono under Linux, and so I tried 
</I>&gt;<i> two approaches:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Using the library EPPlus which works great under .net but not mono 
</I>&gt;<i> (I tried 2.6.7 and later 2.10) although as far as I can tel from Moma 
</I>&gt;<i> the only problem is the crypto module since it P/Invokes, It crashes 
</I>&gt;<i> in the library zipsharp in System.IO.Packaging... the question here is 
</I>&gt;<i> how do I debug into the mono library to discover what exactly is going 
</I>&gt;<i> on in order to fix the library or patch the framework or whatever? the 
</I>&gt;<i> tutorials says that after I GIT the source, the make process could 
</I>&gt;<i> take 45 mns to 2hrs .... so I am kinda lost here! what exactly is the 
</I>&gt;<i> best route to debug the framework library... I could try to copy the 
</I>&gt;<i> files into my solution... but that could get tedious in case of lots 
</I>&gt;<i> of dependencies so what is the best route to take?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. I used CLI_UNO which works nicely in console, but when run from 
</I>&gt;<i> mono 2.6.7 webapp in xsp2, it raises exceptions and fails
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Ambiguous matching in method resolution&quot; while setting the Thread 
</I>&gt;<i> culture (which happens outside my code)
</I>&gt;<i>  that happens even when xsp is run with sudo.... are there any knows 
</I>&gt;<i> limitations between xsp and console that could prevent the code from 
</I>&gt;<i> running?
</I>&gt;<i> In case it matters to someone, here is the line that crashes:
</I>&gt;<i>     componentLoader = 
</I>&gt;<i> (XComponentLoader)multiServiceFactory.createInstance 
</I>&gt;<i> (&quot;com.sun.star.frame.Desktop&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another question: Are there any known plans by anybody to port mono 
</I>&gt;<i> 2.10 to Ubuntu or the easiest way to stay up-to-date is to move to 
</I>&gt;<i> Opensuse?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks a lot for the help....
</I>&gt;<i>
