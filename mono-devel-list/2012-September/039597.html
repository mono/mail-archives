<PRE>Yeah, building Mono in Windows &#160;is painful. &#160;Linux is so much better. &#160;I would use a Linux distribution that includes support for Mono, such as, OpenSUSE, Ubuntu, or Debian. &#160;There could be others, but I haven't tried them.

Virtual Box works with a Windows host and Linux guest very well. &#160;Just make sure to install the additions in your Linux guest. &#160;However, it could get slow building mono in a vm. &#160;You might be better dual-booting.

Just curious. &#160;What were the unimplemented features?

In my spare time, I've been playing with the Arduino UNO R3 microcontroller. &#160;I love to see how I can fit that in with Mono and/or MonoDevelop. &#160;But so far, I haven't. &#160;I think the Netduino at one time looked into getting MonoDevelop to build Netduino sketches (programs). &#160;I found playing with this microcontroller was a great way to learn (or re-learn) electronics. &#160;So far, it has been very fun. &#160;Even Radio Shack caries it. &#160;And many places online too.

Anybody know what is up with the mono-patches mailing list? &#160;I've been following this list for many years.

Subject: Re: [Mono-dev] Doing dev under win?
 

Thanks..&#160; I did compiling under CYGWIN months ago, but I always had 
issues getting it to work outside of CYGWIN when I built it in CYGWIN, perhaps 
that&#8217;s not worth the hassle of trying to figure out again...
&#160;
Working with VirtualBox seems like it&#8217;s probably the better option.&#160; I 
can probably find my own way here, since I&#8217;m somewhat comfortable with the Linux 
command line.&#160; I&#8217;ll avoid compiling outside of Linux I guess.
&#160;
My primary interest lies in keeping busy when I have nothing else to 
do.&#160; I originally had an idea for a mono project months ago, that is a 
project which uses mono (for my own use, not for public consumption), but then I 
ran into some unimplemented or incompatible features or just bugs, and 
redirected my efforts for a while into trying to help mono along by looking at 
the bug report database and that was another way to keep busy for a while &#8211; it 
seemed much more fun to contribute to the project than what I was doing.&#160; 
I&#8217;m not sure how involved I&#8217;ll become.&#160; I don&#8217;t want to engross myself in a 
proejct so much that I stop going to the gym, or reading as a past time for 
example.&#160; But I do want something to do in those in between times.
&#160;

&#160; You can get Mono Tools for testing Mono on Windows. I 
haven't tried it in a while though, as I ran into many issues with its debugging 
support...

Alternatively, a command line just running mono --debug does 
the job. It's fairly compatible with MS.NET so you can just debug there and run 
on Mono.

If you mean developing *Mono*, I compile on Linux and copy that 
to Windows. Never been able to compile Mono in Windows, but the cross-compile 
works and that's sufficient.

For a VM download VirtualBox. Works great, 
and you can share a folder between the two for cross-compiling Mono.

Let 
me know if you have any other questions, be glad to help with whatever. I use 
Mono on Windows nearly every day, so :)

Is there a faq or getting started page for development of mono under  windows.&#160; I know some of it probably requires cygwin, and i would like to  also use visual studio, and may even set up a linux virtual machine.
