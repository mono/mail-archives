I'm trying to port the latest Mono to Haiku OS (most recent nightly build) and I've gotten this far: 


1. Made some very minor changes to get Mono to build (thanks to many fixes already applied in 2010, but the port was incomplete). 
2. Pulled down the latest monolite and placed it in the .../class/lib/monolite directory 
3. make EXTERNAL_MCS=.../class/lib/monolite/basic.exe 
4. In the mono-wrapper file, I added --debug and --trace 


The very first file monolite/gmcs.exe tries to build is basic-profile-check.exe from ./mono/mcs/build/common/basic-profile-check.cs 


Here's where I'm stumped. The mono app reports an out of memory exception, the ./mini/mono process stays stuck in memory churning the cpus. 


I was expecting a full trace report so that I could narrow down the search for the problem but no detailed trace is ever emitted. IIRC it was either the --debug or --trace option which allowed me to see that there was an out of memory exception in the first place (before, I got the ./mini/mono app churning without knowing what was going on). 


Is there something I can do when compiling the native C-based ./mini/mono app to help give me more debug information? 


Is there no --trace information emitted because the provided monolite gmcs.exe wasn't compiled with an option which help provide it? 


Any ideas/help from the Mono development brain trust here would be greatly appreciated. Just feed me the kibbles and I'll hobble along to the next problem until the darn thing runs. 


Thanks, 


Steve
