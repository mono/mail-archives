<PRE>Well the HtmlEditor control doesn't work, I'm talking about the one, if you 
can still find it, from the namespace &quot;Microsoft.ConsultingServices&quot; if I 
remember right.  I troubleshot this during the beta of Windows and 
determined that the WebBrowser integration in Windows was the issue, what 
exactly wasn't working I don't recall now.  All I know is that to get my 
program to work in the release version of Windows 8 I had to disable the 
HtmlEditor Control and replace it with a TextBox or equivalent plain text 
editor, and just tell my brother-in-law, my only user, that if he switches 
to windows 8 he has to download the new version without it.

The WebBrowser integration is still working under Win8.

All related COM interfaces down to IE 5 are still in place as
one would expect from Microsoft ;)
