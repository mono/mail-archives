<PRE>Thanks..  I did compiling under CYGWIN months ago, but I always had issues getting it to work outside of CYGWIN when I built it in CYGWIN, perhaps that&#8217;s not worth the hassle of trying to figure out again...

Working with VirtualBox seems like it&#8217;s probably the better option.  I can probably find my own way here, since I&#8217;m somewhat comfortable with the Linux command line.  I&#8217;ll avoid compiling outside of Linux I guess.

My primary interest lies in keeping busy when I have nothing else to do.  I originally had an idea for a mono project months ago, that is a project which uses mono (for my own use, not for public consumption), but then I ran into some unimplemented or incompatible features or just bugs, and redirected my efforts for a while into trying to help mono along by looking at the bug report database and that was another way to keep busy for a while &#8211; it seemed much more fun to contribute to the project than what I was doing.  I&#8217;m not sure how involved I&#8217;ll become.  I don&#8217;t want to engross myself in a proejct so much that I stop going to the gym, or reading as a past time for example.  But I do want something to do in those in between times.

You can get Mono Tools for testing Mono on Windows. I haven't tried it in a while though, as I ran into many issues with its debugging support...

Alternatively, a command line just running mono --debug does the job. It's fairly compatible with MS.NET so you can just debug there and run on Mono.

If you mean developing *Mono*, I compile on Linux and copy that to Windows. Never been able to compile Mono in Windows, but the cross-compile works and that's sufficient.

For a VM download VirtualBox. Works great, and you can share a folder between the two for cross-compiling Mono.

Let me know if you have any other questions, be glad to help with whatever. I use Mono on Windows nearly every day, so :)

  Is there a faq or getting started page for development of mono under windows.  I know some of it probably requires cygwin, and i would like to also use visual studio, and may even set up a linux virtual machine. I am hoping there is a getting started guide.    direct url not required, just tell me roughly how to find it.

  The last few weeks I've been working on being comfortable in win8..  now I would like to try and get some work done with it.  Sorry for screwing up regex speed with that poorly thought out fix, but I think I've gotten past my embarrassment and would love to be back working on bug reports and maybe eventually bigger projects.
