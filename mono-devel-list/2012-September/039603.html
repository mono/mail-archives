<PRE>I think this was the one I used from a quick google:

<A HREF="http://windowsclient.net/articles/htmleditor.aspx">http://windowsclient.net/articles/htmleditor.aspx</A>

I just downloaded it and looked at the source and it says 
&quot;Microsoft.ConsultingServices.HtmlEditor&quot; which I recall is the one that had 
issues under Windows 8, at least for me, when it worked fine under Windows 
7.

Well the HtmlEditor control doesn't work, I'm talking about the one, if you
can still find it, from the namespace &quot;Microsoft.ConsultingServices&quot; if I
remember right.  I troubleshot this during the beta of Windows and
determined that the WebBrowser integration in Windows was the issue, what
exactly wasn't working I don't recall now.  All I know is that to get my
program to work in the release version of Windows 8 I had to disable the
HtmlEditor Control and replace it with a TextBox or equivalent plain text
editor, and just tell my brother-in-law, my only user, that if he switches
to windows 8 he has to download the new version without it.

The WebBrowser integration is still working under Win8.

All related COM interfaces down to IE 5 are still in place as
one would expect from Microsoft ;)
