doubles have hardware support on 32 and 64bits. longs don't have any under
32bits and things like division are done in software.



&gt;<i> What sort of instrumentation would be useful?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Nothing fancy, high frequency sampling to see what runtime code shows up.
On instruments this the template under: Mac OS X -&gt; CPU -&gt; Timer Profiler.
Then customize it from a sample every 1ms to every 100 us.
