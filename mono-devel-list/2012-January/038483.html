I see.  I am using a SpinLock around every (very short lived) transaction.   Perhaps the primitives used in SpinWait have a different performance profile on OSX vs Linux?   Also, all of the transactions involve longs and doubles {comparisons, load/store, some arithmetic).   I am not at all clear on how longs and doubles would be rendered differently in terms of instructions on 32bit vs 64bit.    I thought even in the 32bit world, intel CPUs had a 64bit pipeline for doubles, though probably not for longs.   

What sort of instrumentation would be useful? 

&gt;<i> Jonathan, if you could do an Instruments run on osx and perf on linux of your add and send the decoded results, it would help a lot troubleshoot

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On a single threaded run, the OSX based E5520 took 21 seconds to process 8 million &quot;transactions&quot; and the linux box took only 8 seconds.   The i7-950 is marginally faster (~10% faster) in typical benchmarks that the E5520.

</I>&gt;<i> Both runs were done with -llvm enabled and with the same garbage collector.    There are probably 16 - 32 million small objects created during the course of this evaluation, but generally with good locality, so should be easy to GC.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The OSX-based mono performance for this app is 3x slower than the linux performance (whereas for typical programs, say in C, the difference would be about 10%).   Both the linux and OSX boxes have significant memory (in fact the OSX box has more memory).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, the OSX version is using 2.10.8 32bit  and the linux version 2.10.6 64bit.  I doubt that there is a retrogression in performance between 2.10.6.  Thinking is more likely to be an implementation difference between OSX and linux?    I would also think that the 32bit vs 64bit would not make all that much difference?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I am wondering whether there are differences in implementation between mono on these platforms that could account for a significant performance difference?
