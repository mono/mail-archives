<PRE>I'd recomend reading this page for a background about the .NET Framework code integration into Mono: <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/dotnet-integration/">http://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/dotnet-integration/</A>
 
WCF seems to be one of the candidates that could be ported almost immediately. 
As you're offering a big chunk of time it might be best to talk directly with Miguel de Icaza (<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">miguel at xamarin.com</A>) to make sure your contributions do not overlap with work by the Xamarin team.

Subject: [Mono-dev] I would like to contribute to mono however it seems things are in flux due to the integration of .NET Core and .NET Framework; where to start?

For example, I'm looking at say WCF as a possibility but some questions pop up?
Will WCF be part of .NET Core? if so should we wait until it's in .NET Core?
If not, then obviously it's a move from .NET Framework.  Are unit test available for WCF?  Would there be a duplication of work if MS has some forthcoming?

BTW I just picked WCF as an example as it seemed high on the list.

I guess I'm saying, where would I be most useful say with contributing 20+ hours a week in the near term (I'm between contract/jobs right now)

BTW I've been doing software development for over 30 years on all sorts of platforms and languages but specializing in .NET since the initial .NET developer conference in 2000.
