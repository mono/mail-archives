Huh.  I'm surprised nobody answered - 

If you haven't already, please be sure to see 
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/community">http://www.mono-project.com/community</A>

And in particular
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/community/contributing">http://www.mono-project.com/community/contributing</A> 

Amongst other things, the above tells you where the unit tests are, and bugzilla.

It's probably best to develop on mac or linux.  Personally I think, that since the latest ubuntu includes a recent-ish version of mono and monodevelop, that's the easiest way to get setup.  (But I loves me some sourcetree, so I prefer to work on the mac instead, despite a little more effort required to build.)

The source is on github.  Fork &amp; pull request.

Discuss stuff on this mailing list first, so as to avoid wasted effort.  Thanks for offering to help.
