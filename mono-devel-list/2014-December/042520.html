Ah that explains a great deal. Thanks for explaining that to me.

&gt;<i> The thing to keep in mind is that the corlib version inside monolite
</I>&gt;<i> needs to match the runtime version or bootstrapping the classlib build
</I>&gt;<i> won't work, so you can't just keep an old monolite and use it to build
</I>&gt;<i> newer Mono (at least that's how I understood it).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is also news to me and very helpful to know thanks. I am not
disagreeing but I am surprised that we have to have an exactly matching
build of monolite for this, whereas we don't  if using a &quot;full-fat&quot;
Mono. I wonder why that is? Because monolite is very barebones just for
bootstrapping purposes ?

&gt;<i> If you don't want to rely on monolite, another option is to
</I>&gt;<i> just install a recent Mono release and use that for bootstrapping
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. right now the build still works with Mono 3.2).
</I>
Now I understand that the monolite package is auto-built I'd prefer to
use that. Although I've had ongoing issues on and off for long time with
missing old monolite archives and so forth.

In that case I will leave Appveyor using get-monolite-latest for now,
but the use of EXTERNAL_MCS I mentioned was, as you say, to attempt to
use the pre-installed Mono image they have on their &quot;build worker&quot; VM
images as standard.

Thanks again, much appreciated.

Alex
