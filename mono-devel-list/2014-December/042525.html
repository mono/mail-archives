<PRE>Yeah, refreshing the contributing guides is on my list, some of them are a bit outdated.
 
I'd say you'll have a better experience developing on Mac than Windows (while Mono does work there, it's not really a priority). You can use Xamarin Studio or your text editor of choice.
The next step would be to fork and clone the code from GitHub and make sure you can actually build it (<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/docs/compiling-mono/mac/">http://www.mono-project.com/docs/compiling-mono/mac/</A>).
This guide is a good read too: <A HREF="http://blog.neteril.org/blog/2013/08/11/the-very-basic-guide-to-contribute-to-mono-bcl/">http://blog.neteril.org/blog/2013/08/11/the-very-basic-guide-to-contribute-to-mono-bcl/</A>
 
Feel free to reach out if you have more questions :)

Hey thanks for the response.

As you might imagine, jumping right into a project like this is a bit overwhelming in terms of how things are done.  Many of the links for contribution are sometimes conflicting or out of date so it's a bit hard to know where to start.


I can either develop under windows or mac, is there a preference where?  On windows I have the Visual Studio IDE, on the mac I guess I have a choice of monodevelop or xamarin (freebie).  What would be the recommendation?  Or is it preference? if so I would probably just use visual studio ide.

Comments?

I'd recomend reading this page for a background about the .NET Framework code integration into Mono: <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/dotnet-integration/">http://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/dotnet-integration/</A>
 
WCF seems to be one of the candidates that could be ported almost immediately. 
As you're offering a big chunk of time it might be best to talk directly with Miguel de Icaza (<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">miguel at xamarin.com</A>) to make sure your contributions do not overlap with work by the Xamarin team.

Subject: [Mono-dev] I would like to contribute to mono however it seems things are in flux due to the integration of .NET Core and .NET Framework; where to start?

For example, I'm looking at say WCF as a possibility but some questions pop up?
Will WCF be part of .NET Core? if so should we wait until it's in .NET Core?
If not, then obviously it's a move from .NET Framework.  Are unit test available for WCF?  Would there be a duplication of work if MS has some forthcoming?

BTW I just picked WCF as an example as it seemed high on the list.

I guess I'm saying, where would I be most useful say with contributing 20+ hours a week in the near term (I'm between contract/jobs right now)

BTW I've been doing software development for over 30 years on all sorts of platforms and languages but specializing in .NET since the initial .NET developer conference in 2000.
