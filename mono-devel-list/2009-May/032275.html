Hi,

I have a look at this problem today and fixed this for Linux - and while
doing that, I realized that the old code was really very broken, it only
worked by accident because the 'mono' binary is statically linked.

My new code now correctly handles dynamic linking and embedding - I
tested this with moonlight in firefox.

We're basically getting the same problem on Linux, when the debugger
stops the first time, the dynamic info structure hasn't been initialized
yet.

To fix this, I read the entry point address (on Linux, this is '_start',
not 'main') from the ELF header and stop there to initialize the shared
libraries.  After that, I look for the '.mdb_debug_info' section in each
shared library we load.

I need to make a few minor cleanups to the patch, especially handle
unloading of the mono runtime - and then I'll commit it to SVN.

Martin
