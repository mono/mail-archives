<PRE>Here's a slightly newer diff for my work on the debugger (When you  
commit something, please commit this). It contains some smaller  
changes to make it work properly with a native application dynamically  
loading mono (if there's any better way to make this work, let me  
know). Now I can use it to debug Unity, there's just one problem at  
the moment:

When generating frame information, it will often find the wrong frame,  
because the different assemblies loaded by Unity contain overlapping  
functions in their symbol files. Any idea how to fix this properly? Is  
there a way to pick which assembly to debug? I can get it to work by  
only generating symbol files for the assembly I want to debug,  
obviously, but some solution which just works would of course be nicest.

The mono.diff file is unchanged from my last patch.

As for MonoDevelop support, for us the ideal way to move on would be  
that you would ship a MonoDevelop build which contains the mac  
debugger support and would just work with unity, then we could focus  
on getting the debugger to work on windows. The question is, what if  
somebody wants to run different versions of Unity side-by-side, and  
those different versions use different versions of Mono? Would a 2.6  
mono debugger be compatible with Unity running mono 2.4? I guess not  
likely. So we might have to build our own MonoDevelop anyways, so we  
could bundle it with each release of Unity.
