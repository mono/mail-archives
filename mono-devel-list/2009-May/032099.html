Hi,

I'm trying to find the hooks to record all memory reads/writes that are made
throughout the lifetime of a program as part of a project I am undertaking
at the moment.

So far I've been driven towards looking at MonoInst (using IR within
method-to-ir.c, and the mono_method_to_ir routine), in particular:

- dreg, sreg1, sreg2

However, each has a signed integer value which leads me to beleive these are
nothing to do with memory addresses. I've also looked at the *MEMBASE* line
of macros which seem to populate these values on the MonoInst type but
nothing seems to give me a clear answer at the moment.

Can anyone shed some light on the matter?

Cheers,

Granville

PS. obviously some IL instructions don't read/write to memory, my question
applies to those that do.
