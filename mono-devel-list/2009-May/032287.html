standalone gio#, building on top of gtk# 2.12:
<A HREF="http://gitorious.org/gio-sharp">http://gitorious.org/gio-sharp</A>

Gtk#Beans, containing some of the useful gtk2.14, gdk2.14, glib2.16
additions: <A HREF="http://gitorious.org/gtk-sharp-beans">http://gitorious.org/gtk-sharp-beans</A>

	This is unreleased software, but is already in use in f-spot svn. For
now, if you want to use it, and as some of the API is subject to change,
you'd better bundle this along with your software instead of installing
it to your gac or waiting for your distro to package it.

	Patches are welcome.

Stephane
