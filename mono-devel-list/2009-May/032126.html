<PRE>Hi,

Jonathan has finished his time with us at Palaso (Thailand) and returned 
to the US.  I'm currently working on the 2.4 packaging for debian and 
our own package, then I'll be able to have a look at the pango work 
again (say in a couple of weeks time).

I'd like to see this committed.  We're very nearly finished with our 
re-engineering / refactoring of the TextBoxTextRenderer to support pango.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * As such it's not possible at this stage to switch to a pango backend

</I>&gt;<i> means it will, for the time being, be an option (getting the new
</I>&gt;<i> features) that reduce compatibility.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;big deal&quot; is that the current work (old mine in SVN and Jonathan
</I>&gt;<i> new patch) use the high-level pango API which is not complete enough for
</I>&gt;<i> some of the options offered by GDI+ (including many supported by
</I>&gt;<i> libgdiplus). This means that the code needs to be re-written in the
</I>&gt;<i> low-level API before being ready for general consumption.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>There's also quite a bit of work in the TextBoxTextRenderer which has 
undergone quite a lot of change.  So far, it seems good enough for our 
purposes.  Rendering right to left, burmese, and other non-roman south 
east asian languages.

I expect to follow up on this in a couple of weeks time.

Regards,
Cambell
