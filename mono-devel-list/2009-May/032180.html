<PRE>I am definitely against having a separate installer for these libraries, 
so I like the way you are thinking.  :)

Some of these make sense to put with the Gtk# installer, like Mono.Posix.

Generally on Windows, you ship your dependencies with your application. 
  I would say something like SharpZipLib should be shipped with MD.  I 
would say the same for Mono.GetOptions, *especially* since it is deprecated.

I could see Mono.Addins going either way.  It probably is used by enough 
Gtk# apps to justify it being in the Gtk# installer.

</I>&gt;<i> mono-addins.  MD uses several mono libs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My inclination is to just merge these additional libraries needed by MD
</I>&gt;<i> into the current installer, as opposed to maintaining a separate
</I>&gt;<i> installer which applications will need to add to their deployment
</I>&gt;<i> instructions.  The current Gtk# for .Net installer weighs in at around
</I>&gt;<i> 8MB.  These additional libraries currently take up just under 1MB in a
</I>&gt;<i> standalone installer, so the addition of them to the current installer
</I>&gt;<i> is roughly a 12% increase in download size.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the user convenience of being able to download all the mono
</I>&gt;<i> stack goodness in one installer outweighs any advantage to be obtained
</I>&gt;<i> by carving out subsets of the stack into independent installers.  It's
</I>&gt;<i> conceivable we could add additional libraries from the stack in the
</I>&gt;<i> future if the demand is high.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, my proposal is that we move to a single &quot;Mono Libraries for .Net&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> installer which contains these mono stack libraries, including Gtk#.  I
</I>&gt;<i> believe I would probably name the installer mono-libraries.msi and
</I>&gt;<i> version it with the major/minor version number of the mono release, and
</I>&gt;<i> an installer version to support updating gtk-sharp and mono-addins and
</I>&gt;<i> other libraries we might add which don't conform to the mono release
</I>&gt;<i> schedule.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We can probably head off any potential issues related to the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;disappearance&quot; of the Gtk# for .net installer by providing some more
</I>&gt;<i> detailed information about the contents of the installer on the
</I>&gt;<i> Downloads page, but there may be some inertia out there around the
</I>&gt;<i> existing installer name on some application download sites, ie &quot;Download
</I>&gt;<i> the latest version of the Gtk# for .Net installer from the mono project
</I>&gt;<i> downloads page.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Feedback appreciated.  In particular I'd like to hear from those of you
</I>&gt;<i> using the current Gtk# for .net installer or those considering win32
</I>&gt;<i> ports in the future.  Which would you prefer, one installer or two?  If
</I>&gt;<i> one, should it remain the Gtk# for .net installer for historical
</I>&gt;<i> purposes, even containing the infusion of mono tastiness, or do we
</I>&gt;<i> rename it to Mono Libraries for .Net?
