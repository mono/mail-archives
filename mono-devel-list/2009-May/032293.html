<PRE>Hi all.

It seems that wsdl2 cannot generate SOAP1.2 bindings, the
/protocol:soap12 switch is not handled. Anyone know of any plans to
implement it, or other workarounds? I see that Mono itself handles
SOAP1.2 since 1.2.3: <A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.2.3/">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.2.3/</A> so I can
probably just generate it on Windows for now. I was going to look in
Bugzilla before I post this, but I can't get to it right now for some
reason.

The reason that I am not using WCF at this point is because I am going
to have a Mono hosted server, and then either Linux or Windows
clients, and I'd like to use the most up to date web service
technology which is also the most cross platform. So SOAP1.2 should
fit the bill here. But technically I don't have a problem sticking
with SOAP1.1.

Thanks,
Joe
