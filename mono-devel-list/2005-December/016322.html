</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> on both implementations).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You're saying that the MSFT implementation is not forward

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> suggest filing a bug report with them. If they ever change the

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> failing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The standalone tests deny what you say. Note that our standalone tests
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are using whatever MS.NET outputs. Thus, there is something your code
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does not match with MS.NET, or MS.NET has changed their 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (BTW I never said that MS implementation is not forward compatible.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I guess MS does perform the same level of validation if the version is not
</I>&gt;<i> equal to 1.0.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Problem is that I cannot seem to succeed in executing the standalone XSLT
</I>&gt;<i> test suite :(
</I>
Yes; Sorry for the inconvenience. It just doesn't build fine under
LF environment (you could still try cygwin environment as I as well
as Mainsoft guys used to do).

I made a quick fix (attached) which is however untested under
Windows (this time) since the latest svn seems broken to run
NUnit tests. After this patch there are still some failing tests
which incorrectly expects Plants.xml and Outputtest.xml (you will
understand what am saying here after seeing the test results).

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If our implementation does not match that of MSFT, then you 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can't have any
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> unit tests that allow you to discover this.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Another reason that string is better than enumeration (like
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Yes/No/Default/Other I guess) is that it becomes a mess 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when someone
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> or ourself want to reuse the code to implement his or her own XSLT
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> implementation that supports custom output.&#181;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Again, I just followed the behaviour of the MS 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementation here, and got
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> your approval for the validation changes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What I asked is to fix the problem and commit. You might have thought
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you *fixed* it, but it is not right. Thus am asking you to revert it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't see any reason that you should stick to the broken changes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll see if I can find time to look into the broken changes. With broken I
</I>&gt;<i> mean broken compared to the MSFT implementation. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is that ok for you ? If not, it might be best to revert all validation
</I>&gt;<i> changes.
</I>
Unless you find something soon, no, please just revert &quot;indent&quot;
part from enum to string (it is the best that everyone would agree.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I really must be missing something here. If you don't want 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> me to work on
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this, you could've said so from the start ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is no reason you should feel you are rejected. I just keep
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pointing out that your fix is not right.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok. Point taken.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (I, of course, don't like the altitude that compatibility is God and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it can throw better behavior away. I'm not here to reinvent MS bugs.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with you. We should not implement MS bugs, but we should stick to
</I>&gt;<i> their implementation as close as possible (as this will allow tests to pass
</I>&gt;<i> on both implementations, therefore allowing us to catch regressions/changes
</I>&gt;<i> in both implementations).
</I>
I don't think you agreed with me on this case. You are still saying that
showing empty message is better than &quot;XSLT compile error&quot; because it is
MS compatible. Am not interested in &quot;general&quot; thoughts since I am sure
that we will never agree.
