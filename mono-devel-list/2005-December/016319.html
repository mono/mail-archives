It is incorrect. It was the first reply I precisely pointed out that
HTML output is broken here, and after my reply you committed what
you haven't posted.

&gt;<i> Our behaviour now matches that of MSFT, is that bad ? We now have unit tests
</I>&gt;<i> that validate our behaviour and that of MSFT (as these unit tests now pass
</I>&gt;<i> on both implementations).
</I> &gt;
&gt;<i> You're saying that the MSFT implementation is not forward compatible, so I'd
</I>&gt;<i> suggest filing a bug report with them. If they ever change the
</I>&gt;<i> implementation, you'll immediately know as the unit tests will start
</I>&gt;<i> failing.
</I>
The standalone tests deny what you say. Note that our standalone tests
are using whatever MS.NET outputs. Thus, there is something your code
does not match with MS.NET, or MS.NET has changed their implementation.

(BTW I never said that MS implementation is not forward compatible.)

&gt;<i> If our implementation does not match that of MSFT, then you can't have any
</I>&gt;<i> unit tests that allow you to discover this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another reason that string is better than enumeration (like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes/No/Default/Other I guess) is that it becomes a mess when someone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or ourself want to reuse the code to implement his or her own XSLT
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementation that supports custom output.&#181;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again, I just followed the behaviour of the MS implementation here, and got
</I>&gt;<i> your approval for the validation changes.
</I>
What I asked is to fix the problem and commit. You might have thought
you *fixed* it, but it is not right. Thus am asking you to revert it.
I don't see any reason that you should stick to the broken changes.

&gt;<i> I really must be missing something here. If you don't want me to work on
</I>&gt;<i> this, you could've said so from the start ...
</I>
There is no reason you should feel you are rejected. I just keep
pointing out that your fix is not right.

(I, of course, don't like the altitude that compatibility is God and
it can throw better behavior away. I'm not here to reinvent MS bugs.)
