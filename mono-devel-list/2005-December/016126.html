</I>
I have no problem with the names. Ideally a good GUI (something we
lack ;-) would present the &quot;errors&quot; with extra details - so the names
can be very general.

You may want to look at FxCop and some other Java tools for category
names ideas.

&gt;<i> Also, I have a comment on the framework code. In many ways, it's better
</I>&gt;<i> than the framework I originally wrote for my rules, but there's one
</I>&gt;<i> capability that I wish it had. In my framework, whenever a rule
</I>&gt;<i> violation was detected, the rule checker could produce an aribtrary
</I>&gt;<i> string describing the violation, rather than just a boolean. The message
</I>&gt;<i> generally included the specific location of the error, and a single
</I>&gt;<i> rule could produce as many messages as necessary. I'd love to add this
</I>&gt;<i> capability to Gendarme.
</I>
The current error reporting is rather weak so don't hesitate to propose,
and implement, something more useful.

&gt;<i> Finally, I have one more question. I generally plan to only directly
</I>&gt;<i> modify the code in my assemblies, and send patches for any other
</I>&gt;<i> changes. However, would it be ok for my to change rules.xml and
</I>&gt;<i> Makefile.am directly, as I add rule assemblies?
</I>
I don't see any problem with that (i.e. it shouldn't cause problem for
anyone else so don't hesitate :-).
