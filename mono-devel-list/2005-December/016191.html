Great, I will try that I guess :-)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, Carlos, in which distro can you reproduce this problem? I ask  
</I>&gt;<i> you this because, before trying to strace the process, I will clean  
</I>&gt;<i> all other possible causes. The first: I am running MandrivaLE2005

</I>&gt;<i> will upgrade completely to Mandriva2006 and then I will try again...
</I>&gt;<i>

I am using Gentoo 64bit. Mono has been installed on my system from  
the emerge packages, from the tar balls, from the binary packages,  
and recently I have been compiling from SVN. I am pretty sure that  
doesn't make a difference as to whether it breaks or not.
My programs that don't exit are not as simple as just running some  
stuff on Main, instead they use a lot of threads (all the ones I have  
control of background), and I use a lot of remoting with a lot of  
Marhsal By Ref objects with an &quot;infinite&quot; lifetime. I would think my  
problem lies on the use of one of those two but who knows, also  
sometimes my programs do exit but I can't tell what the difference was.

Let me know if you figure out something :-)
