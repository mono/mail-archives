&gt;<i> So the vast majority of cluster users are exclusively on our target  
</I>&gt;<i> platforms anyway, and thus it's up to us to provide some decent API  
</I>&gt;<i> (&quot;a superior Mono implementation&quot;): Neither ECMA nor Microsoft will be  
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient for this niche at this stage, and without someone like me  
</I>&gt;<i> implementing something what-so-ever that can be evaluated on our  
</I>&gt;<i> platform and on our side of the market-share, we can't really tell. I  
</I>&gt;<i> wasn't saying ECMA-335 were perfect or complete, but STP is certainly  
</I>&gt;<i> a starting point.
</I>
Correct, this might be an area that is worth extending as more knowledge
is developed.    But extending also calls for this library to not go
into the strict constraints for mcs/ and hence olive/ might be a much
better home for it.

&gt;<i> I've had a brief look at JSR-166 (java.util.concurrent), which has  
</I>&gt;<i> undergone the Java Community Process evaluation procedures, and its  
</I>&gt;<i> API looks highly complicated, more like a full MPI equivalent with all  
</I>&gt;<i> kinds of synchronization classes. That contrasts with the simplistic  
</I>&gt;<i> design of ECMA STP, which I really like; I prefer it hiding the  
</I>&gt;<i> underlying complexity from the application developer, but would like  
</I>&gt;<i> to have that exposed to developers on a secondary level nontheless, as  
</I>&gt;<i> a Mono-specific bonus feature.
</I>
Am not sure that we are going to have a one-size-fits-all library at any
point.   The domain of the problem is large enough that there is a case
to be made for having many libraries in this space.

For instance, it would also be nice to have something like Hadoop
for .NET.
