<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; For Linux, the current &quot;trivial&quot; implementation is enough, a more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complete implementation probably should talk with DBus to Hal, but am
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unsure about that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's not enough for me, as I need to get the free space in the FS.
</I>&gt;<i> That's how I found out that this class is incomplete, and, after
</I>&gt;<i> seeing that it had been so for a long time, decided to volunteer on
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>
Ah, I see.  

&gt;<i> Hmm... You should be right about most unices, but I don't see the
</I>&gt;<i> reason info would be hard to obtain in Linux - AFAIK it supports the
</I>&gt;<i> statvfs(2) POSIX syscall, which df uses to get the FS data. I think it
</I>&gt;<i> should provide most, if not all of the info needed. Besides, it's
</I>&gt;<i> already in Mono.Posix.Native, so the code changes would probably not
</I>&gt;<i> be too invasive.
</I>
If Mono.Posix has it, that seems to be enough.

&gt;<i> There _could_ be problems with esoteric (and not so strange) unices,
</I>&gt;<i> as the massive display of #ifdefs in the GNU coreutils fsusage.[hc]
</I>&gt;<i> shows, but, most probably it shouldn't be so tough for just Linux and
</I>&gt;<i> BSD.
</I>
Correct.   In my opinion, this needs some &quot;glue&quot; support in C, to have
the C compiler assist us when we port to an OS that has different fields
(as you noticed fsusage.[hc] has that).

I do not know if Mono.Posix today does it, if it already does, then we
are set to go

&gt;<i> I will look further into it, thanks for the $address. However, even
</I>&gt;<i> when I can use P/Invoke, shouldn't it be separated from the
</I>&gt;<i> platform-independent code by an interface?
</I>
Not needed, just use an if based on the platform.

Miguel
