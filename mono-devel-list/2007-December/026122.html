<PRE>Miguel just explode the zip file and run each chapter with xsp2 (with mono
1.2.6+ only).

ASP.NET Futures is only 1 .dll called Microsoft.Web.Preview.dll existing in
the source code I mentioned (in the bin folders of last chapters). It also
seems it encloses System.Web.Extension developed by mainsoft guys. So
referencing this dll is enough. Though I am not very sure if this breaks on
copyrights or licences. I am not sure how MS licenced this dll
