Sorry for my denseness... If I understand you right, as soon as I call
mono_raise_exception the unmanaged method is abandoned at runtime, but
I still need to include a &quot;return&quot; call after it so as to appease the
compiler, who doesn't know it. If that is so, I need to make sure I
free all memory aquired _before_ calling raise_exception, needn't I?

Well, I though it was easier to send, test &amp; commit two sequential,
self-contained, non-breaking patches (one for windows, one for linux)
than one big patch, but when in Rome... ok, I'll do like the romans.
I'm rebooting into Linux now and I expect to have the thing ready in
few hours, then I'll send the finished, full W&amp;L patch for testing.
