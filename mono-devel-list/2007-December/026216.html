<PRE>Hi,

I have a question on the performance of remoting between two  
appdomains running in the same process.

We have developed a dynamic dll loading program (plugins) using  
appdomains and assemblies and need to pass a lot of data between the  
two plugins.  We are passing image data between the two
plugins.  The size of the data is around 250K Bytes and the transfer  
happens 15-30 times a second.

Question:

Is remoting optimized when the appdomains are created in the same  
process / application ? ( We are passing the objects using  
MarshalByRefObject)

Are the transfers the same as accessing shared memory or is the data  
still accessed via proxies ?

Is there a big performance hit doing this in Mono ? Is there a better  
solution ?



Thanks,
