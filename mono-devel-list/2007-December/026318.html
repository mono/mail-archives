<PRE>Hello,

The article I puzzled these bits and pieces together from says PE  
support 3.5+ only. As you can see in the patch, it relies on  
System.Core.dll, which to my knowledge was not in 2.0.


&gt;&gt;<i> To share code between olive/ and mcs/, the shared code will have to

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> olive/ is optional.

</I>
Sure they are optional, just like all the ADO.NET providers in mcs/  
which cannot even be disabled during bootstrap. STP on the other hand  
(unlike PE) is part of the ECMA standard, and, thank you very much, I  
have spent a lot of time and effort making this initial implementation  
mature enough. Nobody has spotted anything in my code that was not  
mature.

While you are suddenly changing your mind here (I had asked about that  
in the first place!) while still discussing this simple&amp;safe, self- 
contained initial implementation, I am losing time I would rather  
spend with non-mature advanced&amp;experimental implementations thereof  
and with my applications using it. So if you don't want it, please  
don't waste my time, I'll have to version it in another repository to  
continue my work, just like Cocoa-sharq. Sad thing really.

Merry Christmas anyway.

Andreas
