<PRE>&gt;<i>From: &quot;Paolo Molaro&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">lupus at ximian.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>I'm not opposed to have this stuff implemented in managed code
</I>
That's good.

&gt;<i>(for example the original C implementation has a bug and
</I>&gt;<i>in your code it's duplicated several times)
</I>
What is that bug?

&gt;<i>and you also managed to hide
</I>&gt;<i>the assignment of a local var inside of a conditional expression.
</I>
Is that a bad practice?

&gt;<i>Your code also omits a check that the current code does of the rank of
</I>&gt;<i>the array.
</I>
I don't see any reason for that check because as far as I know byte[,] for 
example cannot be casted to byte[]. Did I miss something?

&gt;<i>I would support a change that reimplemented in managed code
</I>&gt;<i>copy_to_unmanaged()/copy_from_unmanaged(), maybe passing the array
</I>&gt;<i>element size as an additional argument.
</I>&gt;<i>To do this you just need an additional internal call that returns
</I>&gt;<i>a IntPtr to the start of the elements given an Array (the JIT can
</I>&gt;<i>recognize this icall and turn it into an addition of a constant).
</I>
I really like this idea and I think that System.Buffer could use the same 
icalls. I'll try to implement this.

My only problem is that I don't know how could I effectively obtain a pinned 
pointer to a managed object (currently Array) using C#. Do you have a good 
idea?

Thank you for your help.
