Adding a new file is OK, if we're likely to implement more functions for
this type of thing.

&gt;<i> Furthermore, and even more important, I was planning to add at least

</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;get/set volume label&quot; functionality and correct the bug I

Note that io-layer is not used on Windows.


More importantly, we will need a copyright assignment for a code
contribution this big, or a declaration that you wrote the code and it
is contributed under the X11 licence.

From the FAQ (<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/FAQ:_Licensing">http://www.mono-project.com/FAQ:_Licensing</A>):
&quot;Why does Novell require a copyright assignment? 
When a developer contributes code to the C# compiler or the Mono runtime
engine, we require that the author grants Novell the right to relicense
his/her contribution under other licensing terms. 

This allows Novell to re-distribute the Mono source code to parties that
might not want to use the GPL or LGPL versions of the code.

Particularly embedded system vendors obtain grants to the Mono runtime
engine and modify it for their own purposes without having to release
those changes back.&quot;

and the Porting guide (<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Porting">http://www.mono-project.com/Porting</A>):
&quot;Licensing 
If you intend to have your port merged into the main Mono distribution,
keep in mind that you must grant Novell permission to redistribute your
work under other licenses other than the LGPL. This means that you must
be the owner of any code contributed to Novell and that you are in a
position to sign such an agreement. You can also license your changes
under the X11/MIT license, instead of signing a copyright assignment.&quot;

Thanks,

- Dick
