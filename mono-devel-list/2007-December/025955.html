<PRE>Hi,

I-calls don't need marshaling. Maybe some char* to MonoString*
conversions, but it's trivial to do.

Well, that's the way how the I/O subsystem has been implemented:
Write unit test cases on Windows and implement the missing I/O
layer bits.

&gt;<i> I'm currently split between two ways to do the trick with Win32 calls:
</I>&gt;<i> the first, easy way GetDiskFreeSpaceEx, which does 99% of the required

</I>&gt;<i> with IOCTL_DISK_GET_LENGTH_INFO as the argument. More complicated and
</I>&gt;<i> error-prone, but will always report total figures. What do you think,
</I>&gt;<i> people?
</I>
On MS.NET, the 3 related DiskInfo properties always correspond
to what GetDiskFreeSpaceEx returns, even with quotas on,
so I guess their docs are wrong.
