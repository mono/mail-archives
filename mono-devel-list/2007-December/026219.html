&gt;<i> Hi All,
</I>Hey Joe,

&gt;<i> Was wondering if its theoretically possible to run xsp2 directly from
</I>&gt;<i> a cd. I've seen some posts about embedding mono but don't really know
</I>&gt;<i> what is involved. If anyone can confirm whether its possible or point
</I>&gt;<i> me to any information that might help I'd appreciate it.
</I>&gt;<i> What I'm thinking about is being able to run mojoportal directly from
</I>&gt;<i> a cd probably with SQLite. Obviously it would be read only but I can
</I>&gt;<i> see if it could be done it would be great for making demos and also
</I>&gt;<i> maybe I could make a utility to import export from other db platforms
</I>&gt;<i> so a site could be backed up and archived to cd in a way that you can
</I>&gt;<i> see the site as it was at the time of backup.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is this possible?
</I>It is doable and doesn't need to be read-only (to an extent). Your live CD
system would need to have a writable tmpfs mounted on the temp directory (that
is, usually on /tmp), so that ASP.NET can generate and compile assemblies on the
fly. Additionally, the user you would be running xsp under would need their
home directory writable, so that the .wapi directory can be created and written
to. You could create a user whose home would be set to /tmp, and reuse the same
tmpfs for both purposes. Other than those two requirements - it should work.

best regards,

marek
