There is no double marshaling because the utf-16 conversion is cheap.
The double allocation is not so relevant in this case. More important
is API cleanliness.

&gt;&gt;<i> Also, do not use g_assert if you already thrown an exception.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This will kill the runtime.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, so I'm leaving the checks code as exceptions, not as assertions.
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, does the unmanaged method return immediately when an
</I>&gt;<i> exception is raised or does it need to actually execute a &quot;return&quot;?
</I>
Indeed, it won't be reached anyways.

&gt;<i> Conclusion: since all the fuss is about two coments (one about
</I>&gt;<i> assertions in icall.c and one about the Unix PlatformID hack in
</I>&gt;<i> DriveInfo.cs), I'm too lazy to submit an updated patch just for that
</I>&gt;<i> u_u. I'll remove them (if noone does it first) when I submit the posix
</I>&gt;<i> port patch.
</I>
Feel free to post patches only if you have questions, as we
won't test them until you've finished.

Robert
