My time is limited. I could also simply ignore the bugs I encounter and try to 
find work-arounds. It is not my duty to give you test-cases. You the mono 
devs should see it as a courtesy that I report anything. It wouldn't take too 
much time to simply reproduce it and with the knowledge mono devs have they 
could pinpoint it faster then I have done it by wildly guessing. And in fact 
my report was pretty concise. I wrote down everything you need to know to 
reproduce that bug.

I don't need your help. I report a bug in mono, so I help you to make your 
product better!

I compare it with Linux kernel mailing list: There the devs respect the users 
and at least react to mails. The least I expected was a reaction and perhaps 
a hint what the posted error means so I could perhaps provide a small 
testcase within 5 minutes.

In another post, I tried to contibute a small optimizing patch for 
UInt32.Parse. Did I get any reaction whatsoever? Did I?

So moral of the story: I won't waste my time anymore on the mono mailing list. 
If you want people contributing - be it with code or bug reports - no matter 
whether the way of postig fits your taste or not - learn to respect that the 
contributers actually sacrifices some time for mono.

Good luck!
