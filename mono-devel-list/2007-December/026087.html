<PRE>Hey guys!

I generally don't make any announcement when I release a new MoMA for 
the new Mono release.  This is because you just click the &quot;Check for 
newer version&quot; link, which magically downloads the new definition file 
and life is chock full of rainbows and ponies.  However, for the 1.2.6 
release, we made 2 important changes to the definition files that 
warrant a mention.

- Removal of Design Namespaces -
One of our awesome mono-vangelists pointed out that people scan their 
app (and third party controls) and see all kinds of warnings about 
things missing in the Design classes.  However, these classes are not 
used to run apps, just for designers such as Visual Studio.  So we are 
potentially scaring off users for no reason.  Therefore, beginning with 
1.2.6, we no longer include the Design namespaces in MoMA reports.  (If 
you really want the Design stuffs, you can download the definition file 
that includes them on the MoMA home page: <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/MoMA">http://www.mono-project.com/MoMA</A>)

- Addition of .Net 3.0/3.5 Classes -
Beginning with 1.2.6, we include the definitions needed to scan your 
.Net 3.0 and 3.5 apps.  At this point, we report everything as missing.  
Even though we have implemented some of these classes in our Olive 
(<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Olive">http://www.mono-project.com/Olive</A>) project, we do not currently ship 
this with the released Mono, and MoMA tracks the Mono releases.

So what good is adding the 3.0/3.5 stuffs if we are going to report it 
all as missing?  We will soon be getting to the point where we need to 
figure out what new stuff to implement next.  By scanning your app with 
MoMA and submitting the missing report, we can see which parts are the 
most important to our users so we can prioritize.  (And yes, we _really_ 
use this data.  MoMA reports 
[<A HREF="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/momareports/]">http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/momareports/]</A> have pretty much 
dictated our prioritization since it was released a year ago.)

- How Do I Get These New Features? -
So how do you get the new stuff?  Just click on the &quot;Check for newer 
version&quot; link in MoMA, sit back, relax, and enjoy the rainbows and 
ponies.  Or if you don't already have MoMA, you can grab it at:

Thanks!
Jonathan
