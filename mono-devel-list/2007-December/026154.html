<PRE>I hope this is on-topic here -- it's my first post to a mono list, and I
don't know of any that's specific to OpenTF.  However, I figured other
developers here are probably using it, and might be able to help me out. 

I'm a professional .NET developer by day, and a Linux enthusiast the
rest of the time.  I'm pretty amazed that I can so easily port a utility
that I built to run on Windows, just by copying the solution from my
XP-Pro machine to my openSuSE machine and rebuilding it with mono.  Now
that I'm working in this environment, source control is going to be an
issue for me, and I was excited to find out about OpenTF.

I downloaded the Win32 client, and tried to issue a few commands against
our TFS server at work, but I got stopped pretty early on because of our
domain naming convention.  Because I'm in our company's Bothell
location, our machine names here all start with &quot;bot-&quot;.   So our TFS
server, for example, is called &quot;bot-VSTF.&quot;

When I try to use OpenTF to get a list of workspaces on that server, I
get an error telling me that it doesn't understand &quot;-VSTF.&quot;  Apparently
it's consdering the &quot;-&quot; to be a switch character, which makes sense,
however I should be able to enclose an argument in quotes to get around
that.  Not so, in this case. 

I've tried using

    /server:&quot;bot-VSTF&quot;

and

    &quot;/server:bot-VSTF&quot;

with exactly the same results.  OpenTF STILL thinks I'm passing it a
parameter called &quot;VSTF&quot; that it doesn't recognize.

Am I missing something obvious here?  Thanks in advance to anyone who
can help!

    Jerry in Bothell, WA
