</I>It is doable and doesn't need to be read-only (to an extent). Your live CD
system would need to have a writable tmpfs mounted on the temp directory (that
is, usually on /tmp), so that ASP.NET can generate and compile assemblies on the
fly. Additionally, the user you would be running xsp under would need their
home directory writable, so that the .wapi directory can be created and written
to. You could create a user whose home would be set to /tmp, and reuse the same
tmpfs for both purposes. Other than those two requirements - it should work.

</I>You basically always need a ram disk, so if you setup the proper links
(or mount points: there is a filesystem that allows you to view a ro
filesystem as rw) you can easily do it.

Thanks for the responses. By using a ram disk is it possible to run
from any desktop? ie win, nix, mac?
Are we talking about a bootable disk or an executable launched from
disk (across platforms)?

Would be great if a kit could be created that allows dropping in the
web files and SQLite db file, burn to disk and go. This would be an
awesome web site backup solution. Does this seem doable? Know of
anyone else working on this type of project?

Best,

Joe
