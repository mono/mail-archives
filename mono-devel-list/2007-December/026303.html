<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Concerning corlib, Dennis posted a list of namespaces affected by  
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft's new library, and ParallelEnvironment would not seem to  
</I>&gt;<i> conflict with that. More than that I do not know. Personally, I'd  
</I>&gt;<i> rather stick with the published ECMA standard and a superior Mono  
</I>&gt;<i> implementation than with some evolving Microsoft CTP potentially  
</I>&gt;<i> leading to IPR questions at some point. Virtually nobody uses their  
</I>&gt;<i> Compute Cluster Edition anyway.
</I>
Well, the problem with System.Threading.Parallel is that it has never
been used in practice as far as I know.   This was an API designed by
Intel and submitted to ECMA, but as far as am aware, it did not go
through the regular process of API usability testing or got any use
beyond its definition.

The CTP process (or any other process) in which APIs are implemented and
then refined based on actual usage patterns did not benefit this
library.

My suggestion is that this library should stay out of mscorlib, allowing
this code to be reused by those that might have an interest for it on
Windows (so this library would also be usable by folks on the Windows
platforms if they chose to do that).

miguel.
