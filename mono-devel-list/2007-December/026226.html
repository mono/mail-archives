&gt;<i> &gt;         * Editing in the ECMA provider is hard, but Mike has a plan for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;           that.
</I>&gt;<i> Is there any doc or something we could review?
</I>
No, we only spoke on the phone about it.

The idea is that Mike wants to switch to use GtkTextView to render the
documentation, and at the same time, this would allow us to implement
editing very easily.

Am not sure how you can block certain sections from being edited, but am
sure it can be done.


&gt;<i> This is in some way (maybe not much, I dont have the numbers but just
</I>&gt;<i> an impression) affected by the fact that in monodoc is hard to see how
</I>&gt;<i> the contribution gets back to the contributor. The process is slow.
</I>&gt;<i> I mean, the user cannot install new documentation (only installing a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;new&quot; monodoc and that is slow specially if it comes packaged in the
</I>&gt;<i> distro) and the process to review/approve/publish new doc is also
</I>&gt;<i> slow, making at the end that the contributor feels his contributions
</I>&gt;<i> gets lost in the limbo (well, at least, that was what I was told
</I>&gt;<i> several times). The way we have it now discourages contributions.
</I>
Correct, there are many things that we could do to improve the pipeline
for new documentation.   Some of those ideas are also required for the
Web edition of Monodoc.

Having a hammer does not mean that everything is a nail, and for the
case of documentation updating we should not start with &quot;We have
Mono.Addins, now how do we do updates with it&quot;.

Instead we should be thinking about creating the proper pipeline for
documentation: what does it look like, what is the process, and then
implement it.

If the implementation would benefit from Mono.Addins, that is fine, but
it should not be the driving force for it.

Miguel
