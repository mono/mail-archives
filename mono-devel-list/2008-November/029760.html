Hello!
 
I've compiled Mono 2.0.1 on CentOS 5.2, using the directions provided on the mono-project website (which worked great, by the way - thanks very much for posting them!), and things aren't working quite right with my NUnit 2.5 (alpha) project.
 
The NUnit project works great on Windows XP, using Visual Studio 2005.  Oddly, it works great on Windows, using CygWin and Mono 2.x that I installed using the pre-built binaries.  
 
I wanted to try installing, using pre-built binaries, Mono 2.x onto the CentOS machine in order to see if the NUnit test works then (the idea being that if my NUnit 2.5 alpha stuff works on the normal Mono 2.x stuff, then I've probably built my own Mono wrong, somehow).
 
When I went looking for Mono 2.x for CentOS (or RHEL), I couldn't find anything.  CentOS has 1.2.4 or so as an option, and adding the mono.repos file (from mono-project.com) into the /etc/yum directory adds an option for Mono 1.9.x (which is soooooo close :)  ), but there doesn't appear to be a 2.x option.
 
Is this right?  Is 2.x available (pre-compiled) on Windows but not CentOS?  Any help would be greatly appreciated!
 
Thanks! --Mike
