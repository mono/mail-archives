No. I did some initial work, about 18 months ago, to see the complexity
of it. 

Some stuff is easier to do with pango, some stuff a bit harder (i.e.
using the high-level API is not enough). Which is why this (unsupported)
code does not support the same subset of GDI+ text features than custom
one in use. 

It also was quite a bit slower, but no work was done to optimize its
performance, so YMMV.

I'm not sure what's the status of MWF wrt things not supported by
libgdiplus - since MWF also runs MS GDI+ some stuff could already be
supported (else you'll hit some problems there as well, assuming your
application use SWF too).

&#65279;Great news :)

&gt;<i> and I was

</I>
The last discussions were done about one year ago, since then all (and a
lot) of graphical efforts were put on moonlight. To be 100% safe just
send an email to mono-devel-list (c.c. winforms-list too) before
starting your work.
