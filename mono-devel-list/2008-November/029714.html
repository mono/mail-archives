<PRE>I've now managed to get this compiling, and my app is running just fine on
my Solaris 9/SPARC.

Here is what I did:

(1) Got pkg-get from Blastwave installed.  Followed this
<A HREF="http://www.blastwave.org/howto_S8.html">http://www.blastwave.org/howto_S8.html</A>

(2) Set my mirror to the stable tree for Blastwave.

(3) Used pkg-get -i to download and install:
          wget gcc3 gmake gtar autoconf automake glib2

(4) Added /opt/csw/bin to my path

(5) Downloaded and built glib 2.18.2  (seems as glib and glib2 which you can
get from Blastwave doesn't include unsetenv/setenv).
Instructions for glib is:
<A HREF="http://library.gnome.org/devel/glib/unstable/glib-building.html">http://library.gnome.org/devel/glib/unstable/glib-building.html</A>

(6) Just copied the built libglib-2.0.so.0.1800.2 to the /opt/csw/lib
directory  (and made the similar links as the glib2 Blastwave package had
done).  [I probably should just have made a gmake install as root instead.]

(7) Installed the mono-1.2.4_4.sunos8.novell.sparc.pkg  (it went into
/opt/csw/ as default)

(8) Untarred the mono-2.0.1 sources using gtar

(9) Ran configure as

MAKE=gmake CFLAGS=&quot;-g -O2&quot; CC=/opt/csw/gcc3/bin/gcc ./configure
--prefix=/opt/csw --with-tls=pthread --with-includes=/opt/csw/include/
--with-libs=/opt/csw/lib/

(10) Set ulimit using   ulimit -Hs 10124

(11) gmake

It failed during the compilation of System.Core.dll (and other dlls) when
compiling C# sources with an out of memory error.  I guess it is because it
is trying to compile too many source files in one invocation of mcs.
Restarting gmake again a few times made it possible build it all

(12) su to root and add /opt/csw/bin:/usr/css/bin (for ranlib) to the path

(13) as root do a gmake install


Initially step 11 failed with a linker error in mono-2.0.1/mono/metadata:
Saying that unsetenv/setenv was unreferenced in
./.libs/libmonoruntime.a(icall.o).

This went away when I managed to build glib 2.18.2.  Doing a nm on
/opt/csw/lib/libglib-2.0.so (which for the Blastwave glib2 package pointed
to libglib-2.0.so.0.1600.3) showed that it didn't contain the
unsetenv/setenv.  This is why I build libglib my self.



It still feels a little quirky the compile of mono. I've done it once more
to correct a .NET Remoting error
<A HREF="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=422491">https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=422491</A> that I'm dependent on.



I've made a gzipped tarball with all mono related (including libglib-2.0)
that I can find in /opt/csw.  It is 26M.  If anybody is interested I could
make this available, but I haven't got any web servers/ftp sites available.


Anybody out there which know how I can package the binaries into the pkg
format?

Is there some target in the mono distribution to make this happen (gmake
package?).

Back in 1997-1999 I worked full time on Solaris and remember that it was
quite a pain to make packages from scratch, so I would like to avoid doing
this all over again.

</I>&gt;<i>  I'm also interested in knowing if anybody actually is using mono on

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are. On Solaris 9 (SPARC).
