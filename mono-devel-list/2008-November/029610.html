<PRE>All,

 

Is there any easy way to get a disassembly of a function that has been
through the JIT. Currently I am running with multiple &quot;verbose&quot; options
on the command line, writing the output through a file and then
searching for the function but that is fairly horrible, is there an
easier way?

 

So currently

 

mono -v -v -v -v -v test.cs &gt;out

 

then open out in an editor and look at that output. This is very clunky
and the output is very verbose with way too much information.

 

Ideally I want to just pull out the disassembly of a single function
hopefully something like.

 

Mono -disassemble=&quot;TestMain.Main&quot; test.cs

 

Would output the single function disassembly (in x86 not IL), is there
something hidden that I do not know about, any fancy tricks.

 

BTW this is on Linux and not windows.

 

Russell
