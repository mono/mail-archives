I don't want to turn this into a language argument but my feeling was
that mono was allowing C# to become a serious Unix programming language.

Taking your approach above, I can't open sockets and files and pass them
onto the daemon.  Indeed, it would be simpler to write a C or Perl
wrapper to achieve the above but that would (a) be a shame and (b) still
not allow open file handles to be passed on (other than stdin, stdout
and stderr).

Becoming a daemon is a common part of Unix programming.  I don't know
anything about the Mono internals but it seems to me that there should
be some way to achieve it.  The Service paradigm, whilst great for
porting of Windows code, just isn't what is needed for true Unix
programming.

Even if it's not possible to achieve what I'm trying to do today, I hope
I've planted a seed of thought in the Mono developers' minds.

Regards,
Cliff.
