<PRE>As one of the true maintainers of classlibs I'm completely against
ideas to drop cygwin support as it completely destroys my hacking life
(note that I don't mean I dislike adding VS build support), but anyways
here I agree with jpobst on the part to keep using dll.sources.

Here is what I do for adding new source files into svn:
- Update *.dll.sources file:
   ls ../../build/common/*.cs */*.cs | sort &gt; System.Foo.Bar.dll.sources
   make
- Collect which files should be mentioned in ChangeLog:
   &quot;svn diff FooBar.dll.sources&quot;
   -&gt; copy the rectangle(s) on the console output
- Add new files to svn (and svn propdel svn:executable):
   copypaste those lines in &quot;svn add&quot; command line.

Can these tasks ever easier by switching to your beautiful xml csproj?
In MWF land did we create csproj-&gt;sources converter?

Classlib hackers who uses Visual Studio: how do you do those tasks?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hello All,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       Mono on Windows has never been easy. However, lately things to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have continually gotten worse (or I and others have just gotten more 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> annoyed). Setting up an environment takes a lot of effort for a normal 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> windows developer. Cygwin and the whole Makefile based process is very 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> foreign for Windows developers. Not to mention the busted make in cygwin 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and cygwin issues on Vista (amd64). Most people have had enough interest 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in building mono on windows that they took the time to work things out 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (usually at least a day). But that's just the first time; try setting 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everything up again on a different machine or updating your cygwin and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> things start over.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I see the basic issues as:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Cygwin development environment is less than ideal. It's foreign to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> most Windows developers and is a barrier to entry for most people.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Debugging is mostly impossible. gdb seems to provide little help on 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Windows (echoed by others on #monodev)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) Compilation takes forever. I am working on a Dual Quad Core machine 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (8 cores) at 3.6 Ghz. The mono build process still takes hours on my 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> machine. This may be aggravated by virus scanners or other similar 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> software, but the fact remains that all Windows users run virus scanners.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As to not just be a complainer, I am offering some suggestions/ideas and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hoping for others to do the same (or at least critique mine ;-)). Before 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I offer any suggestions, I think we need to balance between two things. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One is making life easy for the mono build/package team to produce a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Windows product. It's not real easy now, but we shouldn't make it any 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> harder. The second thing is making life easy for those who wish to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work/contribute to mono on Windows. This second item is tough at this point.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) We should consider using MSVC as the default compiler for C code on 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Windows. I can compile the entire Visual Studio solution for the runtime 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in minutes. It takes 20-30 seconds if I do a parallel build. We can also 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use the Visual Studio debugger on Windows, which IMO is betten than gdb 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on Windows.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Two propositions for the class libraries have been mentioned 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> previously. One is a lightweight, 'managed make' system that could be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> run easily on windows in place of all the build infrastructure provided 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by cgywin. This obviously allows us to keep using Makefiles on other 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> platforms and keep a unified build process, but requires someone write 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the tool (and maintain it). Another option is to moved to MSBuild/xbuild 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for the class libraries. This would change the build process on all 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> platforms, and require some fixing of our current xbuild tool. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MSYS/MinGW has also been mentioned, but I don't consider that much 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better than Cygwin. I attempted to get it working one time, but gave up 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> after a few days of hacking.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Simply opening a csproj file for a class library, hacking on it, testing 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> under .Net and mono, and then contributing the changes seems a like a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> good goal to aim for in regards to contributors. The build/packaging 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> guys can respond with what they are looking for on Windows.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any thoughts/responses on making mono better on Windows is appreciated.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Jonathan
