<PRE>2008/10/27 Jonathan Chambers &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">joncham at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>       I am looking to work on xbuild a bit, and so I started by looking at
</I>&gt;<i> the the current tests and planned on writing some more.
</I>
Cool! I really think that xbuild is important, so I'm glad you're
looking at this.

&gt;<i> It looks like there are a substantial number of tests (18) marked NotDotNet.
</I>&gt;<i> Is there a reason we'd have this many tests that don't work on .Net?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, some other tests not marked with NotDotNet are failing on .Net? Can I
</I>&gt;<i> assume the tests are wrong if they are failing on .Net?
</I>
That's an interesting point, and I really don't know. Looking at these
tests, it seems that they're mostly checking argument error checking.
Given that most people won't be Microsoft.Build.* XBuild APIs
directly, perfect compatibility may not matter, and more stringent
checking might be useful. OTOH, compatibility is also good.

&gt;<i> The documentation for MSBuild on MSDN is a bit sparse. Is there any other
</I>&gt;<i> source of information other than writing tests?
</I>
I'm only aware of one MSBuild book, unfortunately, and I don't know if
it's any good.

&gt;<i> Finally, I am trying to work on this in VS and MonoDevelop. Does anyone have
</I>&gt;<i> any guidlines on setting up projects for mcs/class type assemblies? My goal
</I>&gt;<i> is to be able to have projects for MSBuild.* and the xbuild assemblies in a
</I>&gt;<i> solution, and be able to build run them. However, I believe when I run my
</I>&gt;<i> locally built xbuild it will load the MSBuild.* assemblies out of the GAC,
</I>&gt;<i> rather than my locally built ones. Also, xbuild locates Task files based
</I>&gt;<i> upon a mono install layout structure. Any advice for working around these
</I>&gt;<i> issues? I basically am looking for make run type functionality like
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop has.
</I>
In this particular case it might be ok to use MONO_PATH.

Probably Ankit can answer these xbuild questions better than I can...
