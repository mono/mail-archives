This argument is ridiculous. How do you guarantee with the current code
that you have enough RAM available instead?
You can use /tmp: if there is not enough disk space you'll throw an
exception.
And there is nothing here that would break the API: the API does not
require nor does it guarantee that all the data is kept in memory.
Please don't make up excuses: keeping the data in memory is simply a bug
in the current code and as such it should be fixed.

This is not true in the common case: you write the data to the disk file
once and at the end you write the zip directory. At the end of the
process you can rename from the temp file to the destination file, for
example.
If somebody does something stupid like removing streams after they have
been added, they'll also pay the price of the additional overhead.
