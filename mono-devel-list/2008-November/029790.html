<PRE>Jonathan,

I year ya!

I stopped hacking on mono on windows.  I only run released versions of mono on windows via Novell's windows installer.  As for hacking on mono, I've been using the mono / open suse vm ever since. 

At first, you could create a branch in svn which would be a place to start so others could participate in hammering mono on windows into shape.  Then when it stabilizes, merge into svn trunk.

A Windows Installer designed to install Cygwin, gtk+ and dependencies, and whatever else necessary to build mono on windows out-of-the-box.  I believe Paco may have tried to create something like this, but it was the size of a CD to download.  

If you look at other free software projects, they use gcc on Linux but they use Visual C++ on Windows, ie. OpenOffice.org and Mozilla.  So, it makes sense that we do the same. 

Anyways, I like your idea Jonathan.  I believe Miguel and others are open to the idea too.  It just requires someone to get it started.

</I>&gt;<i> Hello All,
</I>&gt;<i>       Mono on Windows has never been easy. However, lately
</I>&gt;<i> things to have
</I>&gt;<i> continually gotten worse (or I and others have just gotten
</I>&gt;<i> more annoyed).
</I>&gt;<i> Setting up an environment takes a lot of effort for a
</I>&gt;<i> normal windows
</I>&gt;<i> developer. Cygwin and the whole Makefile based process is
</I>&gt;<i> very foreign for
</I>&gt;<i> Windows developers. Not to mention the busted make in
</I>&gt;<i> cygwin and cygwin
</I>&gt;<i> issues on Vista (amd64). Most people have had enough
</I>&gt;<i> interest in building
</I>&gt;<i> mono on windows that they took the time to work things out
</I>&gt;<i> (usually at least
</I>&gt;<i> a day). But that's just the first time; try setting
</I>&gt;<i> everything up again on a
</I>&gt;<i> different machine or updating your cygwin and things start
</I>&gt;<i> over.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I see the basic issues as:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Cygwin development environment is less than ideal.
</I>&gt;<i> It's foreign to most
</I>&gt;<i> Windows developers and is a barrier to entry for most
</I>&gt;<i> people.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Debugging is mostly impossible. gdb seems to provide
</I>&gt;<i> little help on
</I>&gt;<i> Windows (echoed by others on #monodev)
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Compilation takes forever. I am working on a Dual Quad
</I>&gt;<i> Core machine (8
</I>&gt;<i> cores) at 3.6 Ghz. The mono build process still takes hours
</I>&gt;<i> on my machine.
</I>&gt;<i> This may be aggravated by virus scanners or other similar
</I>&gt;<i> software, but the
</I>&gt;<i> fact remains that all Windows users run virus scanners.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As to not just be a complainer, I am offering some
</I>&gt;<i> suggestions/ideas and
</I>&gt;<i> hoping for others to do the same (or at least critique mine
</I>&gt;<i> ;-)). Before I
</I>&gt;<i> offer any suggestions, I think we need to balance between
</I>&gt;<i> two things. One is
</I>&gt;<i> making life easy for the mono build/package team to produce
</I>&gt;<i> a Windows
</I>&gt;<i> product. It's not real easy now, but we shouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> make it any harder. The
</I>&gt;<i> second thing is making life easy for those who wish to
</I>&gt;<i> work/contribute to
</I>&gt;<i> mono on Windows. This second item is tough at this point.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) We should consider using MSVC as the default compiler
</I>&gt;<i> for C code on
</I>&gt;<i> Windows. I can compile the entire Visual Studio solution
</I>&gt;<i> for the runtime in
</I>&gt;<i> minutes. It takes 20-30 seconds if I do a parallel build.
</I>&gt;<i> We can also use
</I>&gt;<i> the Visual Studio debugger on Windows, which IMO is betten
</I>&gt;<i> than gdb on
</I>&gt;<i> Windows.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Two propositions for the class libraries have been
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned previously.
</I>&gt;<i> One is a lightweight, 'managed make' system that
</I>&gt;<i> could be run easily on
</I>&gt;<i> windows in place of all the build infrastructure provided
</I>&gt;<i> by cgywin. This
</I>&gt;<i> obviously allows us to keep using Makefiles on other
</I>&gt;<i> platforms and keep a
</I>&gt;<i> unified build process, but requires someone write the tool
</I>&gt;<i> (and maintain
</I>&gt;<i> it). Another option is to moved to MSBuild/xbuild for the
</I>&gt;<i> class libraries.
</I>&gt;<i> This would change the build process on all platforms, and
</I>&gt;<i> require some
</I>&gt;<i> fixing of our current xbuild tool. MSYS/MinGW has also been
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned, but I
</I>&gt;<i> don't consider that much better than Cygwin. I
</I>&gt;<i> attempted to get it working
</I>&gt;<i> one time, but gave up after a few days of hacking.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Simply opening a csproj file for a class library, hacking
</I>&gt;<i> on it, testing
</I>&gt;<i> under .Net and mono, and then contributing the changes
</I>&gt;<i> seems a like a good
</I>&gt;<i> goal to aim for in regards to contributors. The
</I>&gt;<i> build/packaging guys can
</I>&gt;<i> respond with what they are looking for on Windows.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any thoughts/responses on making mono better on Windows is
</I>&gt;<i> appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Jonathan
