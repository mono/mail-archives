<PRE>Hi All,

Well, NUnit 2,5 Beta 1 was just announced. That's good news except
for the &quot;minor&quot; problem that the Gui isn't working on Mono right now.
In addition, although you can run the gui on .NET 2.0 and successfully
load tests under Mono in another process, the execution either fails
unexpectedly or sometimes just loses contact with the controlling 
process.

However, I felt the release had already been delayed too long, and 
it works well on Windows so I made the drop. I decided to post here 
to invite folks who would like to build from source and debug it 
to send me any fixes they come up with.

I plan to work on the Mono side more heavily as soon as my
new Linux machine arrives, so Beta 2 should be more directly
useful.

Here's the announcement:

Today we are announcing the first Beta release of NUnit 2.5.

This release has lots of new features, ready to use. Important
hilights include:

* Parameterized tests, with a set of attributes that allow you
  to supply data to your tests in different ways.

* Test methods may be static and generic methods are supported.

* Generic test fixtures may be instantiated multiple times with
  different type parameters.

* Tests may be run using a separate thread and the Apartment State
  may be specified individually for a test, fixture or assembly.

* Tests may be run in a separate process using the CLR version
  of your choice.

* A timeout value may be specified so that tests are cancelled
  if they get into an infinite loop.
