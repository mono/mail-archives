</I>&gt;<i> How is this affected by the SIMD?  It looks like the generated assembly
</I>&gt;<i> from

</I>&gt;<i> So in the case of Mono, this may not be an issue.  If you run the same code

</I>

So does running it on mono versions that doesn't support SIMD intrinsics.
This is
why the SimdRuntime class is your friend. It lets you probe if a method will
be properly
accelerated or not.


&gt;<i> It would be nice to have a Vector3f since when using OpenGL you send a

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Mono.Simd is a way to expose the available hardware functionality. Higher
level
functionality such as this is going to be developed as a separate lib.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think I saw that SIMD only supported 128 bits, so a Vector of 3 doubles
</I>&gt;<i> would not work.  Is there a way to make a Vector of 3 double or 4 doubles
</I>&gt;<i> that uses two SIMD instructons? i.e. like a Vector4D was actually 2
</I>&gt;<i> Vector2Ds? (I know there are some issues, but thoughts?)
</I>

There is not need for that, just declare a struct with 2 Vector2d elements
and
use it. Some algorithms will be different from the Vector4f equivalent, but
that's
expected.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While it is nice to have Properties for the variables in the vector, it
</I>&gt;<i> would be nice to have the variables exposed.  This is needed since calling
</I>&gt;<i> into the OpenGL functions would work cleaner with GL.Normal3(ref vector.X).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Can you explain this in more details? Right we don't expose the variables
because
it would be a lot harder to generate intrinsified code. All in all, a simd
algorithms should
not use the individual elements as much as possible because the result code
is slower.


&gt;<i> Matrices and Quaternions?  If matrices are implemented, I'd like to see
</I>&gt;<i> them
</I>&gt;<i> compatible with OpenGL's matrix format.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Those things won't be implemented in Mono.Simd itself, but by external
libraries.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry if I covered anything that has been brought up before.  I searched
</I>&gt;<i> all
</I>&gt;<i> the SIMD threads and did not see any of this covered.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I plan to get the SIMD accelerated library and test some things out when I
</I>&gt;<i> find the time.  If there is anything I can do to help, from testing to
</I>&gt;<i> reviewing interfaces to documentation, let me know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Keep questioning all aspects of it and post your impressions of using it.
This library
needs real usage to have it's design proven.

The recurring issue of not having a higher level lib still needs to be
addressed.
