<PRE>Hi,

I though monoco was already gone and forgotten, but it seems I was 
mistaken =).

But remember that stackless python is, I think, more or less proper 
implementation while Monoco is basically just a hack.

&lt;snip&gt;

I think Monoco implementation is interesting in hacking sense, but it not 
what I would call a proper one. It is also inefficient with long call 
chains, which is bad.

But I know what you mean, I would love to have real microthreads in Mono. 
I think microthreads are very powerfull and make many things much easier 
to code.
