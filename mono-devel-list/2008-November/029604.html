<PRE>
Thanks for the tip!
 
I tried adding /cygdrive/c/Programs/Mono-2.0/bin to the end of my path, but it didn't seem to help.  When I added it to the beginning of my path, it helped a lot, but I think that's because I was using only the pre-compiled binaries :)
 
I noticed that I've got a lot of junk in my PATH, went back &amp; cleaned it up, and now have just:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/cygdrive/e/Pers/Updates/Mono/CustomBuilt/install/bin:/cygdrive/c/Programs/Mono-2.0/bin
 
mono -V (and mono --versio) still produce no output (at all).
 
(Also, once the build is done, isn't it supposed to produce (or copy from the build directories) everything it needs, so that the new Mono build is completely self-sufficient?
Also (just to make sure this doesn't get lost on this thread) - are there post-build verification (unit) tests that can be run, to verify that my new build works?
 
Thanks! --Mike&gt; To: <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">mono-devel-list at lists.ximian.com</A>&gt; From: <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">robertj at gmx.net</A>&gt; Date: Sat, 1 Nov 2008 13:57:25 +0000&gt; Subject: Re: [Mono-dev] Windows/CygWin: Mono doesn't work after compiling&gt; &gt; Hi,&gt; &gt; MikeTheTall wrote:&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I'm having a bit of trouble compiling mono on Windows (using CygWin). &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; weird thing is that the compilation seems to have gone ok, but the&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; mono/mcs/gmcs programs do nothing afterwards.&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This usually happens when a dll needed by the executable (most likely&gt; &gt;&gt; libglib.dll or something like that) is not in the PATH.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for the tip!&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is there a way that I can find out what .DLLs it's missing? &gt; &gt; You're missing all dependency dlls installed by Mono's Windows&gt; installer into Mono's bin directory.&gt; &gt; Just assure that this directory is listed the PATH environment&gt; variable after your install directory.&gt; &gt; Robert&gt; &gt; _______________________________________________&gt; Mono-devel-list mailing list&gt; <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">Mono-devel-list at lists.ximian.com</A>&gt; <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list</A>
