This is an awesome idea.  Gtk# trunk, and therefore 2.12.6 already has
an msm/wix build set up which can be invoked with:

make win32-installer

There is also a win32-installers module which builds msms for gtk+ and
glade and the dependencies using wix.  It also produces a runtime and
sdk .msi for gtk-sharp + gtk + deps via automake.  You just have to copy
the msms produced by the gtk-sharp build into the root directory and do
a make.

This installer currently specifies a dependency for .Net 1.1 or greater,
but maybe that wix dependency could be revised to test for a mono msi as
well.  The assembly installation is already done using gacutil, so maybe
it will 'just work' with a mono provided gacutil.

Brad and Cody are the gurus on this stuff.  I've tinkered around enough
with it to know how to do minor version updates and so on.  I'd be happy
to work with you guys to see if we can move this idea forward.  I have a
2.12.6 installer sitting on my win32 machine right now which I was going
to see about uploading to mono-project.com, but maybe we can use this
release as an opportunity to get you guys started by rebuilding it on
your build machine(s).

&gt;<i> * Change the Mono windows installer over to Wix so that it is an MSI
</I>
There are a bunch of wix files in svn now to borrow from.
