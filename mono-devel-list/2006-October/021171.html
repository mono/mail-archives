<PRE>I would like to conjecture that a good MSIL -&gt; native compiler work make the
C# memory management code execute at the same speed as compiled C code.
After all, C code gets converted to an intermediate language too, as part of
the compilation. Both methods express the same computations, so it should be
possible to express them in similar ways when outputting binary code. If
anything, MSIL has more annotations, so it should enable more optimizations
and better tools.

That being said, I don't think mono or .net have reached the maturity
required for this goal. However, having the managed OS running (perhaps
slower) should provide some reasons and an experimental platform for
optimizing the MSIL to native compilers.

Bottom line: it might run slower now, but let's still do it :D

I suppose the overhead shouldn't be enormous on unsafe ops - except
that the runtime is still consuming background resources and, as you
say, startup times are increased.
