Just downgrade mono until nant is fixed.

</I>MS is autogenerating a .csproj file from .sln just before the build.
It's a simple target that uses MSBuild task. It can done the same way
in xbuild.

What you also need are working cross project references. It's still
not working in xbuild.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Second: xbuild does not know the implicit targets defined in msbuild,
</I>&gt;<i> like Rebuild or Clean (and probably others).
</I>Someone should write them and test them.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Third: xbuild does not work on windows. Well, it runs, but cannot
</I>&gt;<i> compile anything. This is because to bug 79263 (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=79263">http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=79263</A> ).
</I>It won't change soon. Until it's fixed you can use msbuild.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While first and third problems are not critical, the second one is...
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone knows a solution (besides downgrading to mono 1.1.17) ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Beside that my computer is temporarily broken (happening quite often
to me) xbuild needs more work in the core. MSBuild consists of:
framework + engine + common files + user projects. At the moment core
(Microsoft.Build.Engine) needs more NUnit tests.
When something goes wrong  (anywhere from the components list) new
users don't have patience to fix the bugs. Also I don't have a lot of
time recently.
