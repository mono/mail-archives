&gt;<i> Not by us at Novell. The mono codebase can be tweaked to run with 3 MB
</I>&gt;<i> of disk space and 3-4 MB of RAM (plus the stuff required by the system
</I>&gt;<i> and your app). So it covers the uses cases of both the Compact and
</I>&gt;<i> regular .Net framework.
</I>&gt;<i> The Micro framework looks for a different market and requires a
</I>&gt;<i> radically different runtime implementation. 
</I>
Paolo is correct, the Micro edition is too far from what we want to do:
we are happy to live in the &quot;Regular&quot; and &quot;Compact&quot; worlds, the &quot;Micro&quot;
world is better served by a specially tuned VM.

&gt;<i> If you read the paper you'll
</I>&gt;<i> also note the system doesn't even run .net assemblies...
</I>
Exactly, they use a tool to &quot;compress&quot; assemblies further more, and I
assume they remove stuff that is not really required for micro
implementations.

&gt;<i> You could use some code from mono to do the implementation, but
</I>&gt;<i> once you'll have it you'd need to convince gadget manufactures
</I>&gt;<i> to use it.
</I>
What I think matters the most is that we all implement the same API, and
we can all benefit from a larger &quot;ecosystem&quot; of CLI implementations.

There is no need for Mono to go to every possible device.  It is very
much like wanting Mono on WindowsCE: it makes no sense, just use the
implementation that comes with your OS.

Mono should really be used for places where an existing CLI
implementation does not exist.   

Btw, RedFiveLabs produces a CLI implementation for Symbian phones, and
they consume some of the Mono class libraries to provide the
compatibility.   Not necessarily the same, but it is likely a light
framework.   

It is a proprietary VM though, and I also noticed that there is no
reference to Mono on their site, which is a shame, considering that a
lot of the code they ship comes from Mono.

Miguel.
