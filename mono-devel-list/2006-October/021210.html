<PRE>What he needs and i need and anyone else who wants to help with this issue
needs is a program that takes 5-15 minutes to compile using VBNC. Trying to
profile a 1 hour compile that crashes is a waste of time. Profiling for 10
minutes allows reasonalby fast results when testing a new patch. Making a
change that makes compiling 20% faster will be next to impossible to detect
on a compile that takes over an hour and crashes.

So, as soon as i see a smallish program and instructs on compiling i'll take
a look at the issue. Other than that, i'll just watch the thread. I'm not
going to go hunting for ages trying to find sample apps. I don't use VBNC, i
don't care whether it works or not, but if i am handed a sample app with
instructions, i will try to make it faster.

Thanks,
Alan.
