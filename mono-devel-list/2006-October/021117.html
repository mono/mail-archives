<PRE>I did look at MonoTorrent a while ago and found some potential for improvements ;)

The attached (complete) files contain a few changes to reduce the memory used by MonoTorrent (especially for large Torrents) by a potentially considerable margin ;)

Another thing (which I don't have a ready solution for) is that MonoTorrent has tons of Exceptions from the Sockets in its (for a torrent presumably) normal code paths. I did some tries and this seems to manifest itself in MonoTorrent having huge problems with Torrent where lots of seeds/peers are available.
For .Net 2.0 there are special versions of Begin/EndSend and Begin/EndReceive that don't throw and probably should be used. I think I've seen some workaround to get similar behaviour for Begin/EndConnect, but I can't remember where and what the workaround was :(

It would also be nice to get the eventsystem back to public use (or even better: expose only apropriate events).

Happy hacking
Andreas
