<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> Is that a problem if the compilation cannot complete? Currently vbnc is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> able
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to finish the resolve phase on Mono when bootstrapping and fails in early
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> define phase.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>How much time does it take to complete the resolve phase? I thought that
</I>&gt;<i>was the issue given this thread subject. If there are other issues, they
</I>&gt;<i>should be discussed in another thread.
</I>&gt;<i>And yes, it is a problem if it makes the compiler so slow to be unusable
</I>&gt;<i>as you claim it is.
</I>
The resolve phase is part of compilation so the subject covers the problem.
When doing bootstrap (compiling vbnc using vbnc) finishing the resolve phase 
takes up to 2 minutes on MS.NET. Doing the same on Mono takes at least 1 
hour on the same machine.

So I think it's worth to profile the bootstrap altough it cannot finish 
further phases yet. If that's a problem simply abort compilation arfter 
resolve phase is finished.

&gt;<i>This is why I requested a sample program that can compile, instead of
</I>&gt;<i>trying to profile a program that never finishes.
</I>&gt;<i>When someone posts that we can start to profile, so far nobody did,
</I>&gt;<i>I guess we have to wait for some vb programmers to show up.
</I>
I guess that vbnc is not able to finish compiling other huge programs just 
like itself. But I can't fix SRE to support vbnc because it takes at least 1 
hour to reach the point when it fails that makes debugging and probing 
patches quite impossible.

I think that you could profile the vbnc bootstrap until the end of resolve 
phase because it requires a lot of time and memory by itself.
