He needs Hello World:

	Imports System

	Public Module HelloWorld
		Public Shared Sub Main ()
			Console.WriteLine (&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
		End Sub
	End Module

I don't know VB, so that probably won't work, but he needs a *small* VB
source program that doesn't take &gt; 1 hour to compile, but instead
(preferably) takes &lt; 1 minute.

If Hello World can't be compiled in a reasonable time frame, then....
Ouch.
