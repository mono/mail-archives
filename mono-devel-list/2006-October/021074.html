Disclaimer: I'm not a Mono developer. I just watch this list; I tend to have issues only the developers can solve.

------ Getting patches

The easiest thing to do is to download the current stable version and follow the instructions in the release notes:

  <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Downloads">http://www.mono-project.com/Downloads</A>
  <A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.18/">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.18/</A>

You could also do the same with the daily packages:

  <A HREF="http://mono.ximian.com/daily/">http://mono.ximian.com/daily/</A>


The second-easiest thing to do is to keep up with the bleeding edge of development using Subversion. See:
  
  <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/AnonSVN">http://www.mono-project.com/AnonSVN</A>

Your Linux distribution should most likely come with Subversion, but it case it doesn't:

  <A HREF="http://subversion.tigris.org/">http://subversion.tigris.org/</A>


The most difficult thing to do is patch from the lists. Generally if you just wait, though, the patch will be approved and end up in the repository anyhow.


------ Submitting patches

If you're looking to submit stuff, it's best if you develop against the bleeding edge using Subversion. Once you have modified the code so that it works, run &quot;svn diff&quot; from an appropriate directory. You can save the output to a file and submit it, either by uploading to Bugzilla or to this mailing list.


&gt;<i> Is there a chat room or something where I can meet other developers - 
</I>&gt;<i> specifically those with their emails in the source code ?
</I>
As far as I know, you're in the best place for this, assuming you want to know about hacking on Mono. If you're writing code that uses Mono, and you don't have a bug report or other internal question, the right place is the mono-list:
