<PRE>Hi,

Your details would bring good clarification :-)
To my understanding mono assemblies (and hence(?) their embedded 
resources) are mmaped when they are loaded. That's what Andreas also 
knows, and that's why he is afraid the case if such external resources 
that I put on the table are not mmaped.

As Andreas claimed, non-mmaped resources is worse (and that's what
I agree with him).
