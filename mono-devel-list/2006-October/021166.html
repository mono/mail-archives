</I>&gt;&gt;<i> components and unit testing come into play, is generous use of the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this way (or a similar way, where you ask for a base class but not a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specific implementation), they would neither need to know or care

</I>&gt;<i> The 2 stages sounds sensible: kernel and framework/platform/libraries.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Personally I couldn't care less about a managed kernel, but I'd love to

</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps Miguel to give some advice on the first steps to starting this

Actually if it's all the same, I'd like to keep this operating system
separate from the Unix mentality. That's not to say we wouldn't borrow some
of Unix's ways of doing things, but there are certain things that would need
to be changed.

SharpOS.org isn't taken. Kind of shows both sides of the issue.

If there was enough brains behind this, then I wouldn't mind paying for some
shared hosting on a separate domain name. Set up a wiki (for brainstorming,
designing), svn, and perhaps some forums (I prefer them over mailing lists).
