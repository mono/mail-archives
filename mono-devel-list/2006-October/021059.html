<PRE>Hi,
  
  I later found a reference to &quot;D language&quot;. It has most of the features  I liked in Java/C#. Its compilers are already available. This language  is more suitable to my purposes of (re)writing a more  readable/modifiable Minix and system programming.

Singularity is a research project with a specific goal in mind;   Like
you say, there is room for other operating systems to be built on top of
a managed language.

Various Java-based OSes were built a few years ago, and there is a very
cute one called &quot;jnode&quot; that has matured a lot in the last few months.

</I>
This is one possibility, there are many more in between, you can
certainly tune how much code you want in C/C++/assembler and how much
code you want to keep managed. 

Are you still in MIT?   The Novell office is next to the Stata center,
we could do lunch some time.   Also we are having our annual Mono Summit
this week and the next, it might be interesting to talk.

Miguel.
