<PRE>Hi, Mauricio and Brian! To everyone else -- I'm sending this to the entire
list so that people that might be interested in see there's more interest.

I'm interested in the managed OS idea. I've written some thoughts about this
some time ago, just search for my thoughts through the archive.

Mauricio, you mentioned that you already have code running? I'm very curious
as to how you managed to get it to boot, about the build process, and about
the overall design. Do you have any place where the code is stored, and
could I possibly get access to it?

Thanks,
	Victor

Subject: Re: [Mono-dev] [Mono-devel-list] Operating System in C# Project

sorry, what is the main idea??, develop a operating system in C#, sorry 
I lost the first post.
If that is the case, I have a prototype OS in C# (for educational 
pospuses only), offcourse is very, very, very basic, for the moment only 
open one or more &quot;proto-assembler&quot; files (like compiled programs), and 
allocate memory for each &quot;proceess&quot;, define a PCB for each process and 
begin the execution of each assembly line with a implementation of the 
&quot;Round-Robbin&quot; algorith, also do &quot;context change&quot; to change from one 
process to other &quot;ready&quot; process, and show all the execution information.

anyone interesting??

Mauricio

organize the system around safe plug-ins, each providing some service to the
whole, such as a windowing system, file systems, etc., but which are most
importantly *as easy to write as implementing an interface or an abstract
base class.*
&gt;<i>

booting such an environment.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps the project could be approached in two stages? Half where we boot
</I>the managed environment, and half where we assume the managed environment.
You could design and implement these independently of each other. You could
even design a set of classes to emulate the kernel on top of an ordinary
runtime, for the purposes of unit testing. One strategy I've become fond of,
especially where components and unit testing come into play, is generous use
of the IServiceProvider interface; if components accessed kernel objects
this way (or a similar way, where you ask for a base class but not a
specific implementation), they would neither need to know or care whether
they're using the real thing or not.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Several thoughts. Exciting stuff.
