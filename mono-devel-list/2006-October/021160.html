</I>
The 2 stages sounds sensible: kernel and framework/platform/libraries.

Personally I couldn't care less about a managed kernel, but I'd love to 
help implement the rest of the stack.

So where do we start?  Monix (Mono + Unix) doesn't seem to be a taken 
name!  :)

I could throw up svn, wiki, and mailing-list on my personal domain name 
to get things started.  I hate to keep continuing this discussion on 
mono-devel as its pretty OT.

Perhaps Miguel to give some advice on the first steps to starting this 
project as he's probably started more large-scale FOSS projects than anyone!
