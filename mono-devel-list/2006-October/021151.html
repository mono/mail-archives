<PRE>It is indeed a very interesting concept....

Surely the main limiting factor will be that the runtime is never
going to be as fast as unmanaged C for low level tasks such as
file/memory management...

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My abstract idea was to look at how IL assemblies could communicate with the

</I>&gt;<i> standard shared library calls), then we could simply load the mono runtime

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have many more ideas for such an operating system, including an operating

</I>&gt;<i> regulated system for overriding configuration files (making a removal of an

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The OS I have in my focus is mikrokernel based distributed servers
