<PRE>Hi,

&gt;&gt;<i> What is actually going to happen if i would just load the new and changed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dll and it would actually have different signatures? Would it just crash? Or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> give me a runtime exception at some point when jitting one of the functions?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe i could make mono preload the dll completely and if that fails i know
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they are not compatible?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What happens depends on the change. A diffrent method signature is the
</I>&gt;<i> same as a missing method and you should get a missing method exception.
</I>&gt;<i> Other changes may result in different exceptions and you may well hit
</I>&gt;<i> some crash, also depending if we have implemented checks etc.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe you should describe the problem you're trying to solve instead of
</I>&gt;<i> asking if a weird solution would work.
</I>I am trying to optimize compile time. Unity splits compilation into a couple
of different dll's, depending on which folder the scripts are in.

Compilation is started whenever a user saves a script. Once a dll has
finnished compiling, all dependent dll's need to be compiled.
I would like to avoid compiling the dependent dll's whenever it is possible.
Simply because short compile times make our customers happy.

So my idea was to detect if the signature of the dll we compiled against is
the same as the one we will now replace it with. If the signature is the
same i can simply skip compiling all dependent scripts, thus save a bunch of
unnecessary compile time.
 
Best regards,
Joachim Ante
