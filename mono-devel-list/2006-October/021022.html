<PRE>Hi,

on 14th of October a new nant version was released, fixing some bugs
that were encountered when running on mono 1.1.17. On 16th mono 1.1.18
was released, breaking nant - again. It is able to compile itself, but
falls into an endless loop (seemingly in mono XML parser) when being
run on more complex build files, with many 'include's and complex
'depends' attributes.

I am thinking (again) about dumping nant completely and switching to
(ms/x)build. But as I tried to build a simple VS2005 project today I
run into several problems.

First: xbuild does not seem to support .sln files at all. This can be
worked around by generating a .proj file from .sln in msbuid, or , for
single-project solutions, using just the project file.

Second: xbuild does not know the implicit targets defined in msbuild,
like Rebuild or Clean (and probably others).

Third: xbuild does not work on windows. Well, it runs, but cannot
compile anything. This is because to bug 79263 (
<A HREF="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=79263">http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=79263</A> ).

While first and third problems are not critical, the second one is...
Anyone knows a solution (besides downgrading to mono 1.1.17) ?

</PRE>
