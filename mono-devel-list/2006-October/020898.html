Yes, your assumptions are wrong. An icall is no more a maintainability
problem than any other method. And once some other project will use our
corlib, they will have implemented much more complex icalls already or
they could change that one line in their copy and use the less efficient
way in their project (if and when they will exist).

Since we implemented similar mechanisms in corlib already for a few
years, you can assume I know what I'm talking about without being
condescending.

</I>
You failed to read my mail where I explain that my icall solution allows
adding/removing support for encodings by simply adding/removing data
files in $prefix/lib/mono/encodings/. The option to include the data
inside the binary must be always there to support mkbundle or some embedded
systems.
