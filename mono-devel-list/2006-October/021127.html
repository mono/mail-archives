<PRE>Hello,

    The tree will be tagged on Tuesday October 31st, as usual, we will
continue bug fixing in the trunk release, and we will issue the 1.2.1
and 1.2.2 releases from it as well (due roughly every month or so).

    Around release 1.2.2, we will actually do the branch, as that is the
branch that we will have to maintain for SUSE internally.

    We will continue to keep the &quot;trunk&quot; stable, so new development will
continue to be developed in a way that does not destabilize the tree,
and when the various components are ready (like gmcs on its day, or the
currently linear-ir branch) the code will &quot;land&quot; on the trunk.

Miguel.

</PRE>
