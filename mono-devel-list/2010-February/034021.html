<PRE>Hello Happy Coders,


We are planning to make a new release from the 2.6 branch in the near
future (probably before the end of the month?).  If there are bugs that
you know ought to be backported (customer issues, regressions, and
embarrassments especially) please do so in the next week or so.

As you backport please keep in mind that we are trying to stabilize the
2.6 branch.  Be conscientious and thorough and use your own best
judgment in your area of expertise and consult your colleagues where you
have doubts.  Also don't neglect other platforms like Mac, Windows, and
Linux s390x.  2.6.x will eventually be used as a Novell-supported
release for the Mono Extension for SLE and other products.

We will be doing some testing of the 2.6 branch during this time.  If QA
approaches you regarding a bug please remember that we will also need
time to verify the fix after you check it in.  In other words: please
give us any priority you can.  And don't forget to close bugs as you fix
them and file them as you find them.

Hmm, I should get someone to fix the booc crasher on x86_64...  Oh and
thanks so much to those who pitched in to get our Xen x86_64 crasher
fixed!


Best Regards,

Andrew Jorgensen
Release / Packaging Guy
Novell, Inc.
