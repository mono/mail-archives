<PRE>Hi there,

We're experiencing problems with a server running on a 64bits box with
plenty of RAM.

After a few hours it crashed and the problem was that it was reaching
the max_map_count limit.

We raised it to two times the default (64k) but it also crashed.

The problem is the following: normally the process has a number close to
100 or 200 mappings, but then, in less than a second, it grows beyond
the limit and crashes.

The process is not allocating memory (it stays stable although quite
high) at this point, so we think it must be related to BoehmGC doing
some collection or something.

The process is heavily multithreaded.

Mono is built with --with-large-heap and runs on a 64 bits box (where
the pointer guessing issues with BoehmGC don't hit us so strongly as it
happens on 32 bit systems).

Well, anyone has any idea why this is happening?

Thanks,

pablo
