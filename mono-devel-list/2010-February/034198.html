Hi,

I have a good reason for not wanting to use an additional library in this
case and regarding the POP3 stuff, it is using the standard libraries from a
reliable source online [so it's not mine and the same applies with the SSL
stuff. I know it works - when I look at the debugger code in the Connect,
everything is responding correctly]).

As for not caring about other libraries - that is simply not true. I'm more
than happy to use other libraries if I can't get the .NET ones to do what I
need them to do (for example, using something like Tao makes sense over the
.NET native libs for certain things). While POP3 is not supported in the
same way as SMTP, it can still be achieved using the standard libs.

The code is also not really incomplete. The full POP3 implementation with
SSL is posted as is the driver code. The only thing not there is a listbox
in a winform. I have been trying to get this code working for a day or so
now and no matter what I do to try and get it working, nothing gives - it
hangs in the same place (retrieving the headers). I can't find an answer
elsewhere either for this.

Current idea is to instantate the SslStream and pass that back and forth.
Makes no difference - still hangs.

Thanks though for your comments and as and when I find bugs, I do tend to
put them onto the Novell BZ system.

TTFN

Paul
