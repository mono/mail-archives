</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The UI apps are written for Silverlight 2.0 and hosted within a web browser control within &#160;windows forms applications. The silverlight UI code communicates with the host windows forms app using the ObjectForScripting method of the web browser control and calling javascript from the SL code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How would I best implement this feature in Mono and Moonlight? Basically, I need to host the Moonlight application which needs to perform some operations on the application, such as resize the window, change it to top most etc. which obviously can't be performed from the Moonlight environment directly. I want to avoid opening a socket as there are limited ports available and I am already using some of them.
</I>
I believe Moonlight can be used out-of-browser in full trust with
access to all framework APIs. You could also use the GTK# Moonlight
widget to embed your GUI in a GTK window directly.
