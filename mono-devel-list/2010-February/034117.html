<PRE>I have asked some questions at the FAQ for csharp-sqlite.

<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/csharp-sqlite/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions">http://code.google.com/p/csharp-sqlite/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions</A>

csharp-sqlite is a C# port of the SQLite library.  This is NOT a wrapper to a native library.  It is a 100% port of the C library to C#.

<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/csharp-sqlite/">http://code.google.com/p/csharp-sqlite/</A>
 
1. Can you provide the source zipped up in a .zip file or tarball as .tar.gz please?

2. Is there a online forum or mailing list for this project? I have a feeling my questions here are not in the appropriate place.  Is there a Google Group for these questions?

3. Can you provide a Download link and Download page listing packages that are zipped up or tarballs of sources and/or binaries please?

I really want to try csharp-sqlite out, but I do not want to install HG (Mercurial).

4. Is anyone working on an ADO.NET wrapper of csharp-sqlite where you have only one assembly that is a class library? Preferably based on .NET Framework 2.0.

I have did an internet search, but I have not found anyone. The closest thing is what Tim did for Silverlight, but it does not use System.Data. All the incarnations of Mono's Sqlite libraries do not work for me because they still use native code. And I do not think System.Data.SQLite from <A HREF="http://sqlite.phxsoftware.com/">http://sqlite.phxsoftware.com/</A> has support for csharp-sqlite. Does anyone know if phxsoftware will add support for csharp-sqlite?
