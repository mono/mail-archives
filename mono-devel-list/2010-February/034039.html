<PRE>Hi all,

I want to port our gaming client to Linux and would like to solicit possible approaches.

The client consists of several separate applications, the first, is a background executable (with no UI) that starts and communicates with several others. This one should not pose any issues, other than it does have some code to communicate with some serial and usb peripherals.

The UI apps are written for Silverlight 2.0 and hosted within a web browser control within  windows forms applications. The silverlight UI code communicates with the host windows forms app using the ObjectForScripting method of the web browser control and calling javascript from the SL code.

How would I best implement this feature in Mono and Moonlight? Basically, I need to host the Moonlight application which needs to perform some operations on the application, such as resize the window, change it to top most etc. which obviously can't be performed from the Moonlight environment directly. I want to avoid opening a socket as there are limited ports available and I am already using some of them.

Any advice appreciated.

Peter
