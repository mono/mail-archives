<PRE>Hi,

My conclusion is that there is no magic. The background thread is simply 
killed.

&quot;finally&quot; is never printed altough it is in a constrained execution region.

If you uncomment QueueUserAPC the wrapper will abort the thread and 
&quot;finally&quot; gets printed. But that is just a play with QueueUserAPC to 
study the runtime and Accept, not really necessary.

</I>&gt;<i> You wrote in your original message:
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The fact that I used a managed APC is not required I just have written 
</I>&gt;<i> the test case in C#. I believe that in this case the thread is aborted 
</I>&gt;<i> because the wrapper checks for abortion.
