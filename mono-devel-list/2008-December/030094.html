That's a very good point. However this does not explain how having less
releases will get us less bugs for users or even customers.

Customers are mainly on SLE which we do not release very often. In this
case investing more time in the release leading to SLE make a lot of
sense (e.g. by skipping a normal release).

Just like having closer Mono releases between SLED releases make sense
too. Why ? because shorter releases means we, as developers, don't have
time to break subtle things without the feedback from either QA or the
community. If Mono is more stable when we start a SLE cycle then we are
doing our customers a great service :)

True if all distros were released simultaneously - but they are not.
This means some distros would ship old Mono releases*, which means
recent Mono applications won't work on those recent distros. Neither
users or developers wins in this situation.

* yep I know this already happens but it won't get any better with
longer cycles.

</I>&gt;<i> those items becomes something that we absolutely must do.
</I>
I'm not saying the current plan is perfect, at least not with the number
of steps involved. However I suspect less releases will just make the
problem bigger, but seen/felt less often. 

I think there are other options that would be less extreme (than the
current plan or 2 releases/year). E.g.

Major releases:
* Longer, full QA (current style)
* One per year (or one per SLE)
* No/less other tasks

Minor releases: 
* Quicker, less QA, more user involvement (Zoltan's style ;-)
* 2-3 per year
* Some (but never enough) time to clean up todo list

my 2 canuck cents

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hey Guys,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; see being able to get ahead is to reduce the number of Mono releases

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
