<PRE>We have customers.  When you say &quot;leave some of the QA work to our users&quot; you're really saying &quot;leave some of the QA work to our paying customers&quot;.  This is not an option.  We want to improve the quality of Mono, not diminish it.

Also some of that time is build and installer maintenance, and appliance build, etc. etc..

Also it doesn't make a lot of sense to release more often than the major distributions do.  Our point (our meaning the provo team) is that we can't actually move forward at the rate we're going with the resources we have.  We can't even keep up.  There are a number of things on our eternal to do lists that we likely will never do.  And each release it seems that one of those items becomes something that we absolutely must do.

</I>Hi,

  I would suggest the opposite: do releases more frequently, and leave
some of the QA work
to our users, as is traditionally done by an OSS project.
