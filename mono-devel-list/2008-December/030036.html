</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [Mono-dev] Incoming changes to Mono.Simd
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After some discussions with Mark we decided to do a few changes to 
</I>&gt;<i> Mono.Simd and it would be really nice to have some feedback from 
</I>&gt;<i> everyone on them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One of the motivation is that the current C# of Mono.Simd is not 
</I>&gt;<i> endianess safe and doesn't work as expected on platforms such as ppc.
</I>&gt;<i> The other is to advance the quality of the API.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The first change is to remove byte oriented methods from all vector 
</I>&gt;<i> types that don't work on byte quantities.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right now the only method is ExtractByteMask which is mostly used 
</I>&gt;<i> together with compare ops and will be replaced  with proper operator 
</I>&gt;<i> overloads.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The second change is actually a clarification, Mono.Simd have some 
</I>&gt;<i> arch dependent methods such as casting between vector types that are 
</I>&gt;<i> endian unsafe. The alternative would be to define those methods to 
</I>&gt;<i> have little-endian semantics and, latter on, when we add support to a
</I>&gt;<i> big- endian arch revert this decision.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The last one is a call if extension methods should be used or not.
</I>&gt;<i> Extensions methods will make coding with vector types quite a bit 
</I>&gt;<i> simpler as a lot less typing will be needed. For example, 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Vector8us.AddWithSaturation (a, b)&quot; would become &quot;a.AddWithSaturation 
</I>&gt;<i> (b)&quot;. Right now we already expose some extension methods for 
</I>&gt;<i> interoperability with arrays.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are two issues with extension methods, first that it requires C# 
</I>&gt;<i> 3.0 and .NET 3.5 if you want your code to compile for it.
</I>&gt;<i> AFAIK this is no big deal as those methods would still be available 
</I>&gt;<i> under C# 2.0. The second issue is a limitation of the C# language, 
</I>&gt;<i> which require extension methods to be defined of sealed classes. This 
</I>&gt;<i> would mean that code written against mono 2.2 version of Mono.Simd 
</I>&gt;<i> might not compiler with newer versions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Keeping both versions of the methods is an option as well, but I'm not 
</I>&gt;<i> very keen on the extra bloat imposed. Either way, I would love to rear 
</I>&gt;<i> feedback from people evaluating or using Mono.Simd.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Rodrigo
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I think more extension methods would be a nice addition to Mono.Simd. I'm pretty sure everyone who is using Mono.Simd at this point is prepared for bugs, quirks, and breaking API changes.
