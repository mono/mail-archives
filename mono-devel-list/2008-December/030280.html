<PRE>Hi,

If you need a quick fix you patch will do it. But it is just a workaround.

What I suggested is that the bug is general, not related to Socket.Accept.

You wrote in your original message:

The problem is that the APC call does not cause the accept call to break.

My test case shows that the APC is executed even if accept is not leaved.

I don't know the exact solution because I don't know what the real bug is.

I just wanted to show you that Mono behaves the same as MS.NET except 
that the thread is not terminated at exit so I believe this is the 
difference rather than any hack in Socket.Accept.

The difference in thread state is a bug I believe that may cause other 
bugs if code checks for exact state value but I don't know if this is 
the case.

The fact that I used a managed APC is not required I just have written 
the test case in C#. I believe that in this case the thread is aborted 
because the wrapper checks for abortion.
