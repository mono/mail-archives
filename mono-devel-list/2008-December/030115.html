<PRE>&gt;<i> After a couple of struggle with build system, it's in trunk now :)
</I>
Cool I have it checked out now.

&gt;<i> I made a horrible hack in RabbitMQ/Makefile that now it includes every
</I>&gt;<i> sources outside src/client as DISTFILES. There may be better way to
</I>&gt;<i> reduce this kind of mess. Probably we can build things from bootstrap?
</I>&gt;<i> We can mark some assemblies as NO_INSTALL=yes.
</I>
Yes, I will need to understand the build process a bit better and see
how the RabbitMQ libraries should be built.  The build for RabbitMQ
relies on a code generator to generate some of the client classes from
the AMQP spec XML, so it therefore has a bootstrap process of its own,
which makes it a little awkward to integrate into the mono build.

A couple of newbie contributor questions:

- What is the best handle configuration, e.g. allowing a user to
specify which messaging provider they want to use?  Should I use
System.Configuration?
- Is there any preference WRT posted patches on the list or via bugzilla?

Mike.
