Because the automagic tools were stupid and said that every assembly
found was a public assembly (even when that wasn't the case).

The problem with this is that it requires manual intervention to specify
which packages are required.  Ideally this could all be done
automatically without any manual intervention, and assembly-name -&gt;
package will always be manual.

Which is where listing private assemblies -- with their full path --
could be a workable compromise.  No manual intervention is needed, and
private assemblies are marked as &quot;private&quot; (by using their full path
name), thus removing package conflicts.

&gt;<i> 2) Why does mojoportal even bundle that lib? Every bundled lib is a
</I>&gt;<i> security liability. If you didn't have ten copies of every lib across
</I>&gt;<i> ten different packages, you wouldn't have a problem.
</I>
Not every lib should be in the GAC.  Being in the GAC is an indication
that your public API is stable, documented, and won't change, which is
NOT the case for most libraries (and has bitten us before when we placed
non-stable libs into the GAC, such as ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib, iirc).

Requiring use of the GAC isn't a solution, so private assemblies need to
be well supported by whatever tooling we use.
