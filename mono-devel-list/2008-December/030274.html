<PRE>Korn&#233;l,

I do not understand what you example shows.  I can understand the
thread state problems.  Is that all?

Are you suggesting that I add to my patch to fix the state problem?
Are you suggesting that the socket implementation is fine in svn and
we need to address the abort/stop thread in a more general manner?

Do you have any suggestions?

What I do know is background threads that are blocked are causing mono
to hang on exit.  Foreground threads that are blocked should cause the
process to hang on exit as that is how MS .Net behaves.

Do you feel that we should not wait on background threads on exit, but
simply kill them?

I know it is a lot of questions but I am not certain of the direction
you are trying to point me.  This is a bug that I REALLY need fixed
now.
