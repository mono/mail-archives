<PRE>Korn&#233;l,

After reading your mail a bunch more times and messing with the sample
I think I finally get what you were saying.

What I discovered was that the APC callback being a managed method
gives mono a chance to check the thread state when crossing to and
from the managed thread boundary.  It is not the fact that you called
an APC that was important.  What is important is that the APC was a
managed call.

This does in fact give me some ideas on new things to try.  I will let
you know what I find.  I suspect that my new conclusion will be a
risky change that will require much testing.
