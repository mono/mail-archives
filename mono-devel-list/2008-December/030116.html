</I>
If the code generator only generates autogenerated-api-*.cs, they do not
have to be generated in every build, as long as they can be generated
manually within the files included in the sources.

For src/util/*.cs files, they have to be kept up to date in DISTFILES in
RabbitMQ.Client/Makefile. Or some better makefile trick could apply.

So far, current horrible hack would work ;)

&gt;<i> A couple of newbie contributor questions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - What is the best handle configuration, e.g. allowing a user to
</I>&gt;<i> specify which messaging provider they want to use?  Should I use
</I>&gt;<i> System.Configuration?
</I>
System.Configuration.dll is only within 2.0, though I wouldn't care
much for dropping 1.x support. We could alternatively use environment
variable (we use it for registry and eventlogs for example).

&gt;<i> - Is there any preference WRT posted patches on the list or via bugzilla?
</I>
For non-bugfixes this list would work better.
