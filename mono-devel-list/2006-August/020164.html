<PRE>Hi Atsushi, 

&gt;<i> No one practically uses NAnt on cygwin (it is obvious as NAnt 
</I>&gt;<i> never supports cygwin-considered buid/installation system and 
</I>&gt;<i> no one complained about that).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Considering that there are many many additional things that 
</I>&gt;<i> depends on make like standalone tests, there is no better 
</I>&gt;<i> development environment than cygwin on Windows.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Having build depencency just for dogfooding isn't a good idea.
</I>&gt;<i> Every time the build got broken somehow, it will mess every 
</I>&gt;<i> hackers until the problem goes away. Have you joined the 
</I>&gt;<i> development and tasted that pain?
</I>
Are you making this statement with regard to building Mono or 
applications that run on Mono?

If it's the first, I agree. For applications, it seems as if
standardizing on NAnt is a valid choice to be made by the 
application developers and might even be a preferred choice
since it allows one build to work on all platforms.

Or am I missing some issue of deployment that NAnt cannot handle?

[BTW, I'm currently deciding how to deploy NUnitLite, so it's
a pretty central question for me.]

Charlie
