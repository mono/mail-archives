<PRE>Hello Bjarke,

Answers inline.

&gt;<i> 1. I'm using ildasm and the largely uncommented Cecil source as 
</I>&gt;<i> documentation. Is there some actual documentation other than the FAQ?
</I>
No, sorry.

&gt;<i> 2. I need to know the types of the things on the stack. Can Cecil help 
</I>&gt;<i> with that? If not, is there some nice way to get .NET to handle the 
</I>&gt;<i> operations on the type lattice?
</I>
When you inspect the method body, you can deduce the stack. The OpCode 
has all the details. Check the OperandType and the StackBehaviour 
enumerations.

&gt;<i> 3. When emitting a Br (branch) instruction, Cecil insists on getting the 
</I>&gt;<i> target instruction immediately. The trouble is that when I am writing 
</I>&gt;<i> out CIL to Cecil from the CIL representation internal to my program, it 
</I>&gt;<i> is often the case that the target of the branch has not been emitted 
</I>&gt;<i> yet. Currently I get around this by passing it a dummy Nop instruction 
</I>&gt;<i> and then correcting the target in a second pass. Is there some way to 
</I>&gt;<i> avoid constructing a dummy instruction, such as by getting Cecil to 
</I>&gt;<i> accept a null as the (preliminary) target? (When I try to do that the 
</I>&gt;<i> obvious way I get an exception)
</I>
Well, I could eventually remove the null check, but if you forgot to 
patch the operand, it will point to the end of the CIL stream.

&gt;<i> 4. Cecil requires that the type of a local variable be specified as a 
</I>&gt;<i> TypeReference, so I need to get those. Is there some way to get a 
</I>&gt;<i> TypeReference for built in types like System.Int32 without loading an 
</I>&gt;<i> assembly? The way I am doing it now is getting it as 
</I>&gt;<i> assembly.MainModule.TypeReferences[&quot;System.Int32&quot;].
</I>
assembly.MainModule.Import(&quot;System.Int64&quot;) will do.

&gt;<i> 5. I would like to emit the short form of the Br instruction when this 
</I>&gt;<i> is possible. My initial idea is to always emit the short form, and then 
</I>&gt;<i> expand to the long form where necessary. That makes it necessary to take 
</I>&gt;<i> into account the possibility of a cascade where expanding one 
</I>&gt;<i> instruction increases the distance to the target of another Br 
</I>&gt;<i> instruction which then also needs to be expanded to the long form and so 
</I>&gt;<i> on. I would like to avoid this trouble, so is there some way to get 
</I>&gt;<i> Cecil to do this for me?
</I>
No, at least, not yet.

Feel free to ask if you have other questions,

Jb
