<PRE>Basically, I would like to write applications in C#
that can create OpenDocument text documents in
OpenOffice.org 2.0.

However, I have found the Mono bridge to
openoffice.org is not available on many Linux
distributions because the libuno_cil.dll must be built
on Windows because it's written in Managed C++.

So, I have thought of another possiblity.  Create a
simple java jar to do my basic stuff I need then use
ivkm.net to create the stubs to be used by mono.  My
C# application would used these generated stubs.

I haven't used ikvm.net, so I am only guessing here.

Do you think this is even possible?

Unless, someone is willing to port the libuno_cil.dll
from Managed C++ to using C# and if need be generating
CIL on the fly.  I'm guessing here again.
