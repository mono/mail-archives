I can nothing but second that.  I have been following the Mono project
since a few years and I am happy it has progressed so much.

That said, I cannot understand why so much effort is devoted to
&quot;showcase&quot; projects such as MonoDevelop (3 SoC projects) and BitTorrent
libraries/clients (3 SoC projects), when the very thing real programmers need -
the debugger - is in a constant state of flux and &quot;use latest SVN&quot;
state.  Programmers need a working debugger shipped with the mainline,
even a CLI is fine; heck most of us have been using gdb for years
without a problem.

I know that Martin put a lot of work in the debugger and that it worked
once in a while, but seen from the perspective of a developer that only
uses the official Mono releases, it has never worked.

Sorry for the harsh words, truth is I really like Mono and the great
guys behind the project.

Greetings,
Sebastian
