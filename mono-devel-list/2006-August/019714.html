Yes, that's why I was asking for some configuration parameter or 
something to modify this behaviour... :(


&gt;<i> If you're willing to step up the game a bit, though, it's possible to hijack the 
</I>&gt;<i> remoting pipeline right at the end, where it would try to find your client based 
</I>&gt;<i> on its URL and send a message across to it. You'd be creating an IChannelSender 
</I>&gt;<i> and an IChannelReceiver pair, with maybe one or two other supporting classes.
</I>
Are you referring to any of the tecniques that are being used by the 
solutions that Robert and I have mentioned?


&gt;<i> But, of course, that's a tad advanced. Alternative, simpler methods exist 
</I>&gt;<i> outside of remoting, such as just creating your own 
</I>&gt;<i> System.Net.Sockets.NetworkStream and piping your data across it.
</I>
I don't want to deal with Sockets. I am trying to use Remoting so as to 
avoid the implementation of the network bits :-/


&gt;<i> So... I'd say no, there's no simple way to do it, not without finding an 
</I>&gt;<i> already-made product, and I don't know of any.
</I>
Thanks for the info Brian!

Regards.
