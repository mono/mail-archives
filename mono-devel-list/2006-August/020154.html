<PRE>No one practically uses NAnt on cygwin (it is obvious as NAnt never
supports cygwin-considered buid/installation system and no one
complained about that).

Considering that there are many many additional things that depends
on make like standalone tests, there is no better development
environment than cygwin on Windows.

Having build depencency just for dogfooding isn't a good idea.
Every time the build got broken somehow, it will mess every
hackers until the problem goes away. Have you joined the
development and tasted that pain?
