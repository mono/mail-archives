I had never seen it in &quot;the wild&quot; but fx 2.0 is still quite young (wrt
to design/development/deployment of new applications).

Anyway I always suspected it's main goal (or target audience) was for
application deployment on intranet or, perhaps, an extranet between
highly trusted partners.

&gt;<i> The only time I've even seen it mentioned (outside of this mailing list) 
</I>&gt;<i> was on Microsoft's site.  I was forced to use it to download some 
</I>&gt;<i> application, and I remember having so much trouble trying to get 
</I>&gt;<i> ClickOnce to work (even with IE on Windows) that I eventually gave up.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I understand how in-browser apps (like Flash &amp; ActiveX) are appealing, 
</I>&gt;<i> but what is the use case for ClickOnce over the standard Click Twice it 
</I>&gt;<i> takes to run a normal application?  (First click download, second click 
</I>&gt;<i> to run.)
</I>
I recall two:

The first is CAS. &quot;Click Twice&quot; == Full Trust (i.e. like all local
application), while &quot;ClickOnce&quot; application can have their own
restrictions.

The second is automatic updates (and policies around that).
