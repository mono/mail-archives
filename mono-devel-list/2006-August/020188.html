Yes, this feature would be a nice one and, as Jon said in another email,
ClickOnce [1] would too be a nice feature. And I can quickly think, even
without caffeine, about a few more ;-)

&gt;<i> Unfortunately not having this is a huge barrier to some people adopting

</I>
and while it may be a &quot;huge barrier to some people&quot; [2] I definitively
don't think this is a *huge* barrier in the general (current or would
be) community.

&gt;<i> Providing this (as even MS .Net doesn't seem to provide web page plugin

</I>
Let me rephrase this the way I see it:

        Providing this would put Mono on par with Java and IE/.NET and
        likely requires many more contributors on board, making Mono
        grow in a new direction.

Feel free to disagree as this is only my humble opinion ;-)

Don't misunderstand me, I *want* this, I even want it *now* (if wishing
helps ;-) but I don't think it will attract &quot;many more contributors&quot; (!=
users) or make &quot;Mono grow much faster&quot;. Still I like your enthusiasm :) 


[1] A full implementation CAS isn't a hard requirement to both features.
Applying digital signatures and limiting execution to FullTrust|Nothing
(i.e. no execution) would be a limited but valid (and useful)
implementation (although I personally prefer the full/complete one ;-)

[2] Those people are invited to contribute, directly or indirectly, to
Mono. Alternatively they should speak louder when similar discussions
happens on the mailing-list.
