Thats not very descriptive.  It describes what probably 90% of the users 
of mod_mono/xsp do.

We've had a small low traffic web service running on xsp in Debian Linux 
for probably a year now.  It communicates with Windows and Linux clients 
using SOAP and pulls data from a MySQL database.  At first it required a 
restart now &amp; then, but I haven't had any problems with it in some time.

There have been reports of users frustrated when running mod_mono/xsp in 
high traffic/high availability environments, but the Mono team always 
seems eager to help debug.

This discussion is probably better suited for the plain mono list.
