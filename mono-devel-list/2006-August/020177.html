Yeah if you write your program in classes then it's easy enough just to
make a gui for both web and desktop using asp/gtk whatever.

Don't mean to start a flame war here, but if you want the write once run
anywhere in a browser. If you can't do it in AJAX, do it in flash.

Secondly, have you heard of ASP.NET, The equivilant of JSP for .NET.
Mono's support is pretty good. 
 
	 
	Aside from needing C for linux kernel programming,
	what would even be better then &quot;write once, run anywhere&quot;, 
	is
	&quot;write for any purpose, write once, run anywhere&quot;
	and unfortunately mono has not provided a means to use it as a
browser
	plugin like Java. For me i could go for just a plugin to Firefox
(linux
	and Win32), wouldnt even need it to support IE.
	Until this can occur, a programmer still has to Java or (active
x
	plugin), to achieve  web page integration.
	Unfortunately not having this is a huge barrier to some people
adopting 
	mono.
	Providing this (as even MS .Net doesn't seem to provide web page
plugin
	ability of .Net) would put Mono over the top, and likely bring
many more
	contributors on board making Mono grow much faster.
