<PRE>Hey,

The MS.NET 2.0 remoting stack is pretty the same as in 1.0.
Does the sample work in MS.NET?

Nice! That's a really smart solution.

&gt;<i> The only things I haven't clarified yet is the license of the code (I

Here's what I found:

If you post to CodeProject then you retain copyright of your article and 
code. You also give CodeProject permission to use it in a fair manner 
and also permit other developers to use the sourcecode associated with 
your articles in their own applications as long as they do not remove 
your copyright notices or try and take credit for your work.
&lt;/cite&gt;

I don't understand the &quot;or try and take credit for your work.&quot; part.

It's probably better to contact the author for a true OSS license.
