<PRE>Hi,
 
I'm trying to embed mono in a C++ application on Windows and I keep getting a link error saying that mono_jit_init(const char *) is not found. I am using `pkg-config mono --cflags --libs` as an option to g++ and it looks like it should be working, but still I get this error.
 
I've tried to build mono from source (the mono-1.1.13.8 source tarball) using Cygwin and g++, but I keep getting an error when I am running the make command. It gets as far as the ./mono-1.1.13.8/mono/mini directory and then stops with the following error:
 
.dep/genmdesc-genmdesc.Po:1: *** multiple target patters. Stop.
 
Has anyone else encountered this error and how was it fixed? Also, are there any steps missing to build mono from the Compiling_Mono page on the website?
 
Finally, assuming I ever get mono to build correctly, will this help me with my problem of not being able to link an application that is using mono?
 
Many thanks,
 
Simon
