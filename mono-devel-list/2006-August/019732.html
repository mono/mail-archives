I know, but it's throwing exceptions because of these little differences.

Well, actually I haven't tried with Mono yet :/ But I asked on Mono list 
because I like it much more than the MS C# newsgroups :)

I have solved the issues with the following changes:

- Used the new overload for the method RemotingConfiguration.Configure 
which receives false as the second parameter.
- Use the attribute typeFilterLevel=&quot;Full&quot; for the formatters in the 
config files (as stated at: 
<A HREF="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=572115&amp;SiteID=1">http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=572115&amp;SiteID=1</A>).
- Change port=&quot;6001&quot; to port=&quot;0&quot; on the client.exe.config file so as to 
allow launching several clients from the same machine.

It gives some more obsolete warnings (1.1 API) but now it works 
flawlessly :D

&gt;<i> It's probably better to contact the author for a true OSS license.
</I>
Well, if I port it completely to the 2.0 stack I will publish the work 
as GPL leaving the note about the author ;)

Regards.
