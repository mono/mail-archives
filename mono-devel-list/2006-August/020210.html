<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> This looks pretty cool! Mono could probably use this, since there
</I>&gt;<i> are so many test, and we (the NUnit team) would be interested
</I>&gt;<i> to hear more about it as well. We're looking at similar things, but
</I>&gt;<i> your ideas are welcome - and so are you and your code!
</I>
Please, feel free to use it... :-)
 
&gt;<i> Have you actually modified NUnit? Looking solely at the zips, 
</I>&gt;<i> because I'm a little pressed for time right now, it appears that 
</I>&gt;<i> you build on top of NUnit, rather than actually modifying it.
</I>
Well, now that you say, if I remember correctly I made an small
modification in order to be able to launch an individual test... But 
I don't really remember! (It was last January). I will check it
tomorrow and let you know. 

But yes, when I said &quot;modified&quot; I should have said &quot;extended&quot; or
something else...

&gt;<i> If you are modifying it, I'm hoping you use some non-conflicting
</I>&gt;<i> version number scheme, to avoid confusion. In fact, if you give
</I>&gt;<i> out any modified assemblies, renaming them would probably be better,
</I>&gt;<i> since it makes it obvious that there is a change. This may seem
</I>&gt;<i> like a small thing, but if you have ever dealt with bug reports
</I>&gt;<i> on an unidentified version of your code, you'll understand.
</I>
Yes, yes. You're right. I will check and let you know.

&gt;<i> One thing, since you're distributing nunit and log4net, you should
</I>&gt;<i> put the the license files from each product into your zips. If
</I>&gt;<i> you are actually modifying NUnit, there's a notice of attribution
</I>&gt;<i> that you're supposed to include as well - see the license.
</I>
Right. Good to know. Sorry. Well, I think &quot;pnunit&quot; will run on top
of standard NUnit. If not I will let you know the changes, but as far
as I remember we are just building on top. I will include the license files
of both products on the zip files. Sorry again... :-(

&gt;<i> I have downloaded the source and I'll give it a try in my next
</I>&gt;<i> idle moment. :-)
</I>
Ok, let me know.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We needed to test our software on a distributed scenario. We 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have developed an small extension to NUnit.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We think maybe somebody can find it interesting, so we have 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> published the source code, an example and a short description 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at our website. You can find it at pnunit.codicesoftware.com.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hope you find it interesting.
