<PRE>&gt;<i>It's clear to me, but we'll need to see how we distribute this file (on
</I>&gt;<i>Windows) and locate it.
</I>
I think the easiest solution is to put the DLL to the directory of 
mscorlib.dll. This lets us use different version based on framework version 
(altough it's not currently required but MS.NET does the same so may be 
required in the future) and it's quite easy to locate the directory of 
mscorlib.dll so the file can be located easily as well.

&gt;<i>However, I haven't yet managed to read entries from the event log. Does
</I>&gt;<i>anyone have any info on doing this (using C#) ?
</I>
Using API it's quite easy:

Of course in C# this requires some wrapper code but you should use 
ReadEventLog.

If you want to read .evt files directly it may be a bit difficult because 
the format is barely documented.

I don't know how much rationale it has but if we were using the same .evt 
format on other OSes it could be fully compatible with Windows.
