I'm sorry if you've already been over this before: but does anyone 
actually use ClickOnce?

The only time I've even seen it mentioned (outside of this mailing list) 
was on Microsoft's site.  I was forced to use it to download some 
application, and I remember having so much trouble trying to get 
ClickOnce to work (even with IE on Windows) that I eventually gave up.

I understand how in-browser apps (like Flash &amp; ActiveX) are appealing, 
but what is the use case for ClickOnce over the standard Click Twice it 
takes to run a normal application?  (First click download, second click 
to run.)
