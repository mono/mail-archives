Finally I have totally ported it to 2.0 and fixed it a little bit so as 
to use more interfaces (and then not having the server implementation as 
a reference in the client).

However, I am making some tests and I come out with strange behaviours 
with the demo: after 5 or some more minutes of idle connection, the 
server looses the proxy references to the clients and removes their 
remoting object automatically (without using any written code) and 
silently from the array, without giving exceptions neither in the server 
nor in the clients.

I have already overriden the InitializeLifetimeService method of the 
MarshalByRefObject client class (returning null), but this doesn't fix it.

Anybody has an idea of what can be going on? Or tell me a way to debug 
it? I can send the modified sources in case anyone asks me for them.

Regards.
