Sorry, I exaggerated a little bit. Of course this could
be done in parallel.

&gt;<i> Second, there are scenarios where FullTrust|Nothing is a valid choice.

Indeed, but since we were speaking about a generic browser plugin,
low trust is rather the usual trust level. See JavaScript, Java Plugin,
Flash.


&gt;<i>         Company A deploys FireFox (on top of Linux, of course ;-) and a
</I>&gt;<i>         mono-plugin configured to accept signed applications (i.e.
</I>&gt;<i>         assemblies) from &quot;Company A&quot; only. In this case this is an
</I>&gt;<i>         (non-existing) technological choice to deploy corporate
</I>&gt;<i>         applications yet it totally avoid the &quot;untrusted source&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>         problem.
</I>
Ok, that's a subset of the CAS.

&gt;<i> Third, this could be the idea of fun to somebody and I feel obligated to
</I>&gt;<i> encourage such individuals ;-)
</I>
Of course. I didn't intend to yell &quot;stop energy&quot; :-)
