<PRE>Hello,

    Mono 1.1.17 has been released.

    Full release notes:

	www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.17

   Mono was branched at version 1.1.13 to become the stable version of Mono
   that is distributed by Novell on its enterprise products. That series of
   releases are only getting bug fixes.

   Before each release we run all of the regression tests on Mono, so we
   consider this release usable for deployment, but there are still a few
   changes in various areas.


   This release is mostly a bug-fix release, there are very few new
   developments.

                           Changes since Mono 1.1.16

Highlights

   Basic world: The Mono Basic compiler and the Basic runtime have been
   removed from the Mono distribution. A new compiler that is compatible with
   Visual Basic 2005 and a matching runtime are now part of a separate
   distribution. On this particular release, we are offering the basic
   runtime, but the compiler is not able to run completely on Mono yet.

   Windows.Forms: Printing is now supported.

   This release is able to compile and build IronPython 1.0 RC2.

   COM: Basic COM support has been integrated.

  Inotify watcher

   The FileSystem will now use inotify directly on systems that support it
   without having to go through an external library like FAM or Gamin, this
   should make our use of inotify reliable. [Gonzalo Paniagua]

  Async Process Notification

   2.0 support for asynchronous reads and writes from the Process class is
   now supported [Gonzalo].

  Mono Loading as a Shared Library Works Again

   This was a problem that mostly affected the OpenOffice plugin, which
   loaded Mono as a separate process, this is now fixed [Zoltan Varga]

  Gtk# Split

   As part of Gtk# becoming one of the supported language bindings in the
   Gnome platform and Tomboy, a Gtk#-based application, becoming part of the
   Gnome desktop, Gtk# has been split up into multiple packages, instead of a
   single one.

   All the packages are available from our download site [Mike Kestner].

  Mono.Cairo

   Mono.Cairo bindings now supports a DirectFB surface now [Alp Toker].

  System.Drawing

   This release includes an upgraded Cairo stack (from 1.0 to 1.2) and
   allowed us to enable printing in System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms.

   The original work was done by Jordi Mas, the Cairo upgrade by Peter Bartok
   and the work was completed by Chris Toshok.

  2.0 API updates

   Process now support the async io handling [Gonzalo Paniagua]

   String.Normalize is included [Atsushi Enomoto]

   ADO.NET 2.0 updates, included an implementation for
   SqlConnection.GetSchema (Nagappan, Nagappan).

  Registry

   Updated to the 2.0 API. [Miguel de Icaza]

   Gert added support for splitting the registry across user and system level
   settings. [Gert Driesen]

  mod_mono

   Added support for X.509 client certificates. It's now possible to use
   System.Web.HttpClientCertificate with Apache. Certificate validation can
   be done by Apache, Mono or both (default). [Hubert Fongarnand, Sebastien
   Pouliot]

  Security

   SN now accept password-protected PKCS#12/PFX files to strongname
   assemblies. This feature is enabled in both 1.x and 2.0 profiles
   [Sebastien Pouliot]

  Additions

   CodeDOM JScriptCodeProvider code JavaScript code is now included
   [Akiramei]

   An EventLog implementation is available on both Unix and Windows, to use
   set the MONO_EVENTLOG_TYPE variable like this:
     * local[:path] generates a log file in the given path. If the path is
       not given, it will store the results in &quot;/var/lib/mono/eventlog&quot; on
       Unix and in &quot;%APPDATA%\mono\eventlog&quot; on Windows.
     * win32: This uses the native Windows API to send the log messages to
       the system event log.
     * null: discards all of the events

   to a pathname where the events should be logged to [Atsuhi Enomoto, Gert
   Driesen]

   COM Interop: Basic support for Runtime Callable Wrappers (RCWs). This
   allows users to use unmanaged components from managed code. [Jon Chambers]

   Sqlite now exposes a Version property to detect which underlying database
   is available (2.x or 3.x) [Joshua Tauberer]

   Mono.Posix now features an abstract Unix end point in addition to Unix End
   Points [Alp Toker].

  XML Land

   Fixed XmlSchemaSet and XmlSchemaCollection problem across multiple
   namespaces [Atsushi Enomoto]

  Important Bug Fixes

   Dynamic linking of Mono is now possible in applications that were using
   the TLS (open office) [Zoltan Varga].

   Newly created AppDomains no longer inherit the list of loaded assemblies
   from the main domain. This has an important side-effect, to get XSP and
   mod_mono running, you must install the latest versions of it (released in
   this iteration), older versions will not work [Lluis Sanchez].

   A number of missing pieces of System.IO.Ports have been implemented
   (ReadChar, ReadLine, BytesToRead, BytesToWrite, ReadTo, return USB tty
   devices) [Miguel de Icaza].

   ASP.NET Cache will check dependencies now (79002) [Gonzalo Paniagua]

  Alpha Port

   The beginning of a port to Linux/Alpha has been contributed to Mono,
   [Sergey Tikhonov]

  Cilc

   Cilc, a tool to generate C wrappers for managed routines has been
   relicensed from the GPL to the MIT X11 [Alp Toker]

  Postgress

   Updated the Posgress data bindings to RC3 [Francisco Figueiredo].
