<PRE>Don't mean to start a flame war here, but if you want the write once run
anywhere in a browser. If you can't do it in AJAX, do it in flash.

Secondly, have you heard of ASP.NET, The equivilant of JSP for .NET. Mono's
support is pretty good.


Aside from needing C for linux kernel programming,
&gt;<i> what would even be better then &quot;write once, run anywhere&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;write for any purpose, write once, run anywhere&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and unfortunately mono has not provided a means to use it as a browser
</I>&gt;<i> plugin like Java. For me i could go for just a plugin to Firefox (linux
</I>&gt;<i> and Win32), wouldnt even need it to support IE.
</I>&gt;<i> Until this can occur, a programmer still has to Java or (active x
</I>&gt;<i> plugin), to achieve  web page integration.
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately not having this is a huge barrier to some people adopting
</I>&gt;<i> mono.
</I>&gt;<i> Providing this (as even MS .Net doesn't seem to provide web page plugin
</I>&gt;<i> ability of .Net) would put Mono over the top, and likely bring many more
</I>&gt;<i> contributors on board making Mono grow much faster.
