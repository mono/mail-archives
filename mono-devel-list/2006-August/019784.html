<PRE>Thank for the answers. After i have looked at Carlos's code I think it 
would be a waste of time to write a SslClientStream/SslServerStream 
wrapper as a temporary solution. I guess it would be of more help if I 
helped getting the implementation Carlos is working on done.

</I>&gt;<i> Carlos did a lot of work on this. Sadly we had to fix a number of issues
</I>&gt;<i> in the original code and that greatly affected the complexity of
</I>&gt;<i> maintaining such a large patch.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It doesn't really seems like anything has happened since then. Is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anybody working on it right now?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most work is indirect but the plan hasn't changed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The current code has some issues(*) that we want to fix in the current
</I>&gt;<i> implementation before moving it to SslStream (i.e. priority to bug
</I>&gt;<i> fixing and 1.x support over 2.0).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	(*) but much fewer than last year :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Larger issues, like easier testing and reworked async support, will come
</I>&gt;<i> into the SslStream rewrite itself. At some point (post 2.0) Ssl[Client|
</I>&gt;<i> Server]Stream will be deprecated inside Mono.Security.dll.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't think it would be very difficult to implement it as a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SslServerStream/SslClientStream wrapper. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe but it won't be pretty. You'll be mixing (and converting) fx 1.x
</I>&gt;<i> classes, Mono.Security classes and 2.0 classes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So if nobody else is working on it I think I will implement it as such.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Feel free to try your approach (you may want to get in touch with Carlos
</I>&gt;<i> before starting it). This may get us a (temporary) step forward in
</I>&gt;<i> functionality and I'm sure many people would appreciate that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However I'm unsure we'll want to support an extra level of hack into the
</I>&gt;<i> final (and supported) Mono 2.0 release. SSL debugging is hard enough
</I>&gt;<i> today, so I prefer investing time into simplifying the code and process.
