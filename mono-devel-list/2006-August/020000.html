<PRE>Thanks for the code review, I wouldn't mind some contributions ^_^

    I really didn't mean to plug any software, I was just trying to post
a helpful comment, in this case pointing to a wrapper library (that I
happened to author) for encryption.  I suppose a BSD license would be
more proper, especially since it's mostly a wrapper class, and doesn't
add much value to the .NET FCL encryption implementation (aside from
static salt, which you're right, should be changed).  As soon as I get
more time, I'd like to make this thing a much better product, with
whatever license seems appropriate at the time.  I don't really have a
preference, since I think encryption should be easily accessible and
easily accomplished, but done correctly so as to achieve true security.

</I>&gt;<i> Are you sure about that ? ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It compiles in mono with no changes (I use it in a text editor app I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; built to provide encryption).  It's extremely simple to use, and I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; started building support for certificates, but haven't had time to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; finish it (it's licensed under the GPL, so changes are very welcome).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Check it out here:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.rockwithme.org/index.php?option=com_remository&amp;Itemid=37&amp;func=fileinfo&amp;id=3">http://www.rockwithme.org/index.php?option=com_remository&amp;Itemid=37&amp;func=fileinfo&amp;id=3</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You're right that the framework isn't easy to use, even for the most
</I>&gt;<i> simple things. Having a wrapper class for some common scenarios, like
</I>&gt;<i> yours, makes a lot of sense (but, as Miguel said, a GPL one may be a
</I>&gt;<i> little restrictive).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I had a very quick look at your library. It looks mostly correct except
</I>&gt;<i> for the following:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First, you're not using the power of the Fx design to help you. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> E.g. you should be able to have a single class accepting a
</I>&gt;<i> SymmetricAlgorithm instance (or, with a different ctor, an
</I>&gt;<i> AsymmetricAlgorithm and/or an X509Certificate ...) and hide all
</I>&gt;<i> difference inside your code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This would reduce code duplication and make any (existing or future)
</I>&gt;<i> cryptographic algorithm usable by your library (without any more
</I>&gt;<i> work/code).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Second, you should also take care about non-portable API.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> E.g. des.Key = pdb.CryptDeriveKey(&quot;RC2&quot;, &quot;MD5&quot;, 128, /*Add a little salt
</I>&gt;<i> */ new byte[] {0x49, 0x76, 0x61, 0x6e, 0x20, 0x4d, 0x65, 0x64});
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In this case this is not even 100% portable within Windows - because the
</I>&gt;<i> code will call the default CSP, which can be different from machine to
</I>&gt;<i> machine (and implement a different key derivation algorithm).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note: Of course using a static salt isn't a good idea.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Finally (well from my quick look ;-) you should use &quot;using&quot; for
</I>&gt;<i> IDispose-able types. This will ensure that all the critical data will be
</I>&gt;<i> zeroize as soon as possible. This is &quot;less&quot; a problem when you're
</I>&gt;<i> dealing with strings (because of the way the VM deals with them) but a
</I>&gt;<i> good idea nevertheless (e.g. if you want to deal with private keys
</I>&gt;<i> later).
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I want to report on my recent experiences getting the C# port of  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; BouncyCastle Crypto API (<A HREF="http://www.bouncycastle.org/csharp/">http://www.bouncycastle.org/csharp/</A>) running on 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Mono. It will be a reasonably brief report as it turned out to be mostly 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; painless :).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; (BC is written entirely in C# for .NET 1.1 by the way).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; BouncyCastle is a great cryptographic library. However it's C# port
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; doesn't use the cryptographic base classes of the FX so it somewhat
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; limits it's usefulness (e.g. yet another API to learn and difficult
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; interop with existing code).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Here's what I did:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; - Installed Mono 1.1.13.6  and MonoDevelop 0.10 via the Ubuntu package 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; manager.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; - Imported the existing VS2003 solution file in MonoDevelop, and built 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; everything, with no significant issues.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; - The existing NAnt build file also seemed to work without modification 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; (although I am having a little trouble running the nunit tests via nant).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; - Ran our regression tests revealing only one failure, which I tracked 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; down to a bug in the x86 runtime (Bug# 79087), fixed in svn.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; ...and that's all there was to it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I certainly expected it to be more painful; that it wasn't is to the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; credit of the Mono developers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; The regression tests take a few minutes to run, allowing a (very) 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; ballpark performance observation that Mono is about twice as slow as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; MS.NET for running these tests. I guess anyone concerned with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; performance of Mono might find some or all of these tests a useful 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; benchmark.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The results are similar to running our cryptographic code on top of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; MS runtime, i.e. they get twice as fast.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I would be interested in hearing from people who are able to test 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; BC/Mono on other architectures than x86. The crypto algorithms do a lot 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; of bit/byte twiddling, and could potentially shake out similar problems 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; in other runtimes to the bug above.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; You can get an approximate idea of the time required by other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; architectures when looking at monobuild, compare the unit tests
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; execution time with the runtime build time. However the results will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; more &quot;general&quot; (and better reflect real-life scenarios) than CPU-bound
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; cryptographic tests.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Pete.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Thanks for the report!
