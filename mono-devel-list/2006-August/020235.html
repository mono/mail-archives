<PRE>Personally, I think it'd be better if CAS was done before something like
that was officially supported: that is, after all, the killer feature of
.NET on the web. However, it could take awhile to get all the fixings right
for such a plugin, so it could be better to start it soon and have it ready
(or close to it) for when CAS is fully functional. On a side note, won't it
be strange when malware targets .NET ClickOnce instead of native ActiveX? I
wonder what .NET malware written for Windows would do on a Linux box (heh,
probably not much).

I think the reason that Mono hasn't gone in this direction is (along with,
of course, the CAS prerequisite) is because the public use of client-side
.NET web applications is actually pretty small (not including
company-internal stuff)... so it's less of a need and more of a want.

If these oodles of contributors who are waiting for a plugin really exist, I
think they should help out with CAS, because that's what's holding back a
secure implementation.

</I>&gt;<i> The only time I've even seen it mentioned (outside of this mailing list) was on Microsoft's site.  I was forced to use it to download some application, and I remember having so much trouble trying to get ClickOnce to work (even with IE on Windows) that I eventually gave up.
</I>&gt;<i> I understand how in-browser apps (like Flash &amp; ActiveX) are appealing, but what is the use case for ClickOnce over the standard Click Twice it takes to run a normal application?  (First click download, second click to run.)
