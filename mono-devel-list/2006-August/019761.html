Very interesting numbers; but I think I am considering a &quot;clustered&quot; 
solution similar to the one proposed by Brian.

Anyway, I think I will give up with the Reachability library, it seems 
very unstable and I have found out that it's much slower than the 
original solution proposed by Ingo Rammer; so I am testing it, I have 
specified the same clientProviders/serverProviders parameters so as to 
make it work with FW2.0 and now I get a weird behaviour: if I try the 
demo between client and servers on the local machine, it works 
perfectly, but if I place the client on other machine (changing the URL 
of the server in the config file, of course), I get:

Which seems a very strange problem because both machines are running the 
same runtime.

BTW: many thanks about the advices for sending the file. I know that 
sending the whole file in a single call would be terrific for large 
files, but I just wanted to do the proof of concept (in fact, locally, 
it worked perfectly for 8MB files!, remotelly it wouldn't receive the 
call at all, and no time-outs were involved because I was making the 
call just after launching the server and the client).

Regards.
