<PRE>The thread is about a language (platform) allowing one to do most
anything, adding Flash to the mix immediately defeats the purpose.

I use asp.net, great for many things ....

when i am talking &quot;in a browser&quot; i am talking about stuff that you can't
handle with asp.net, like a full fledged  arcade game (to take it to an
extreme), a video/audio playing client, the power to properly sync video
and audio, integrate with the local file system and other resources.
ASP.NET and AJAX don't even get you 1% of the way there, and even flash
is incredibly lacking in some of these areas.

I have been involved with many projects, and the clients always have the
same needs. The audience goes to a web site, and you want to make your
sale QUICK (or viral growth), say its a podcast client, a community
collaboration tool, casino games, whatever, and the clients don't want
to hear about a install executable, or a pokey asp.net sol'n, they want,
when i boils down to it, an active X plugin (vb, c, c++ depending on
needs) (or Java), and it just runs right there, no fuss no muss.


Programmers don't think twice about installing a gtk app, 
99+% of web users will not touch it with a ten foot pole.
They will move on to the next casino, or community collaboration tool
that just works right there, and yes many times now, you can find it to
be flash, but lets not even go there and discuss the use of flash.

I am just saying, it would be nice if Mono answered everyones needs
(w.r.t the general places that you deploy programs - i.e. stand alone
apps, ajax, asp.net, scripts/command line, and lastly browser plugins ),
and filled this rather HUGE void (all be it a particularly commercial
one).

</I>&gt;<i> Don't mean to start a flame war here, but if you want the write once
</I>&gt;<i> run anywhere in a browser. If you can't do it in AJAX, do it in flash.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Secondly, have you heard of ASP.NET, The equivilant of JSP for .NET.
</I>&gt;<i> Mono's support is pretty good.

</I>&gt;<i>          
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>         Aside from needing C for linux kernel programming,
</I>&gt;<i>         what would even be better then &quot;write once, run anywhere&quot;, 
</I>&gt;<i>         is
</I>&gt;<i>         &quot;write for any purpose, write once, run anywhere&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>         and unfortunately mono has not provided a means to use it as a
</I>&gt;<i>         browser
</I>&gt;<i>         plugin like Java. For me i could go for just a plugin to
</I>&gt;<i>         Firefox (linux
</I>&gt;<i>         and Win32), wouldnt even need it to support IE.
</I>&gt;<i>         Until this can occur, a programmer still has to Java or
</I>&gt;<i>         (active x
</I>&gt;<i>         plugin), to achieve  web page integration.
</I>&gt;<i>         Unfortunately not having this is a huge barrier to some people
</I>&gt;<i>         adopting 
</I>&gt;<i>         mono.
</I>&gt;<i>         Providing this (as even MS .Net doesn't seem to provide web
</I>&gt;<i>         page plugin
</I>&gt;<i>         ability of .Net) would put Mono over the top, and likely bring
</I>&gt;<i>         many more
</I>&gt;<i>         contributors on board making Mono grow much faster.
