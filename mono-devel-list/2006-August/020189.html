Not only as if they were ActiveX controls. MS.NET's S.W.F.Controls
are in fact ActiveX controls. They implement the required COM
interfaces and are embeddable by several ActiveX containers
(IE, MFC, etc.).

The only difference to plain ActiveX controls is the new
embedding host of the Internet Explorer. The host knows about
MS.NET, its type activation, the CAS, and it is apparently more
secure than ActiveX alone (I hope so ;-).

About Mono's plugin: w/out a working CAS it's grossly negligent
to even think about an implementation that allows the execution
of assemblies from untrusted sources. Even if they were signed
with God's own key, they still were insecure to execute.
Let's not beat this dead horse again.
