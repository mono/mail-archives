I can't help you with the build issue, because the VS.NET build
is unsupported and broken from time to time.

I can provide you a VC++ DEF file for the runtime DLL
(mono-1.dll), that gets installed with Mono's Win32 Installer.

Having this file (see atachment), you don't need to build Mono
with VC++ any more.


Q: How do I generate a LIB file from the DEF?
A: Using VC++'s LIB.EXE tool:

lib /def:mono-1.def /out:mono-1.lib /machine:x86

Q: How do you I compile with VC++ against Mono's runtime DLL?
A: Have a look at this command line and at the sample C code.

cl /W4
    /I&quot;c:\program files\mono-1.1.15\include&quot;
    /I&quot;c:\program files\mono-1.1.15\include\glib-2.0&quot;
    /I&quot;c:\program files\mono-1.1.15\lib\glib-2.0\include&quot;
     monotest.c /MD mono-1.lib

monotest.c:

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;mono/jit/jit.h&gt;
#include &lt;mono/metadata/assembly.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
     MonoDomain *root;
     mono_set_dirs (&quot;c:\\programme\\mono-1.1.15\\lib&quot;,
		   &quot;c:\\programme\\mono-1.1.15\\etc&quot;);
     root = mono_jit_init (&quot;test&quot;);
     printf (&quot;%d\n&quot;,  root != NULL);
}
