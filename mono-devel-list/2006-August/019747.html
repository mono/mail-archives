<PRE>                                     Hi,

  What is the problem with try-finally ? There are two cases:
- if there is an exception, the runtime will call it, just with the catch clause
- if there is no exception, control flow just falls from the end of
the try block to
the beginning of the finally block. This is just a normal control flow edge.

                 Zoltan

</I>&gt;<i> I am considering implementing a CIL to CIL optimizer as suggested at

</I>&gt;<i> up for criticism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having previously implemented an optimizing compiler in ML in a course,
</I>&gt;<i> I think that SML.net (<A HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/TSG/SMLNET/">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/TSG/SMLNET/</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> would be better suited to the task than C#. F# would be nice too, but it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't have an open source compiler as far as I can tell.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The proof-of-concept I have in mind would do the following steps for a
</I>&gt;<i> subset of the full CIL. This subset would include a conditional branch
</I>&gt;<i> opcode, the addition opcode and full support of exception handling
</I>&gt;<i> including (the dreaded) try...finally.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Read in an assembly using Cecil
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Construct the control flow graph while converting to a quadruple
</I>&gt;<i> format (i.e. eliminate the stack in favor of registers)
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Convert to SSA form using the algorithm from
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.hipersoft.rice.edu/grads/publications/dom14.pdf">http://www.hipersoft.rice.edu/grads/publications/dom14.pdf</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Do intra-procedural conditional constant propagation as described on
</I>&gt;<i> page 447 of &quot;modern compiler implementation in ML&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=103136">http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=103136</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Eliminate phi-nodes using moves and convert to CIL (i.e. reintroduce
</I>&gt;<i> the stack)
</I>&gt;<i> 6. Output assembly using Cecil
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The next step would be to support at least the subset of CIL that is
</I>&gt;<i> output by the Mono C# compiler. Then it would be nice to extend the
</I>&gt;<i> optimization to be inter-procedural. Then I would focus on outputting
</I>&gt;<i> better CIL code like eliminating some of those moves coming from SSA. I
</I>&gt;<i> have plenty ideas for what to do after that, but I'll have to see how
</I>&gt;<i> much time I have.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having taken a look at the ECMA CIL spec, I don't see anything in there
</I>&gt;<i> that should present really big problems other than exceptions and the
</I>&gt;<i> finally construct (which is a problem even without exceptions).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Exceptions are annoying because of the way they complicate analyzing
</I>&gt;<i> control flow, but after having thought and read about how to handle them
</I>&gt;<i> for some time I think they will be manageable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The try ... finally construct, on the other hand, now that just seems
</I>&gt;<i> painful to me. As in red-hot-pincers-jammed-into-the-eyes-
</I>&gt;<i> while-being-electrocuted-naked-in-a-snow-storm painful. Having scoured
</I>&gt;<i> the web to the best of my ability, I have find PLENTY of material on how
</I>&gt;<i> to deal with try ... catch in Java bytecode and CIL, but somehow people
</I>&gt;<i> usually never bother to explain how they handle try ... finally. I guess
</I>&gt;<i> how to efficiently construct a precise CFG and do SSA form in the face
</I>&gt;<i> of try ... finally is just obvious to everyone but me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A solution to the problem involving higher-order functions is described
</I>&gt;<i> at <A HREF="http://flint.cs.yale.edu/flint/publications/lamjvm.pdf,">http://flint.cs.yale.edu/flint/publications/lamjvm.pdf,</A> though that
</I>&gt;<i> solution seems unsuitable for an imperative representation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A different solution used in SafeTSA is described at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.google.dk/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cs.utsa.edu%2F~vonronne%2Fpubs%2Fjvr-dissertation.pdf&amp;ei=f43aRKLBJ7nWwgHZvsGhCA&amp;sig2=nhWafzjm_synZsuIHpXhqg">http://www.google.dk/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cs.utsa.edu%2F~vonronne%2Fpubs%2Fjvr-dissertation.pdf&amp;ei=f43aRKLBJ7nWwgHZvsGhCA&amp;sig2=nhWafzjm_synZsuIHpXhqg</A>
</I>&gt;<i> which consists of making several copies of the code in the finally
</I>&gt;<i> clause. The potential for code size explosion is huge, but on the other
</I>&gt;<i> hand finally clauses are usually small... but it is still not a
</I>&gt;<i> satisfying solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An obvious alternative would be to represent finally blocks as what they
</I>&gt;<i> are and then having every single pass of the optimizer be aware of how
</I>&gt;<i> to deal with this in some ad-hoc fashion. I don't like that either
</I>&gt;<i> because all the details just seem horrendous to deal with as far as I
</I>&gt;<i> can tell.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another idea is putting the finally code in a function call with plenty
</I>&gt;<i> of ref parameters. This should work nicely together with
</I>&gt;<i> inter-procedural optimizations. It ought to be possible to reinsert
</I>&gt;<i> these calls as a finally block in most cases when outputting the CIL.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure this will work well, though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So far the best solution I can think of is to copy the finally code if
</I>&gt;<i> it is small and insert function calls if the finally code is large.
</I>&gt;<i> Always inserting function calls and having a general inliner pass might
</I>&gt;<i> work well too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If anyone has any ideas or experience they would like to share, I would
</I>&gt;<i> love to hear it. Especially on the topic of try ... finally!
