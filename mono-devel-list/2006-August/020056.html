<PRE>Hi everyone,

I have read this article though sill not quite understand how to do it.
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Guidelines:Application_Deployment">http://www.mono-project.com/Guidelines:Application_Deployment</A>

The normal way to run an application compiled with Mono would be to invoke
it through the Mono runtime, like this: mono myprogram.exe
However, I have to deploy my application to end users that are not supposed
to have Mono runtime/libs installed.

What's the best practice for deployment?

I'm planning on packing my application EXE with required DLLs such as
intl.dll, libglib-2.0-0.dll, mono-1.dll, etc., and the mono.exe.
Is it a feasible way to do?
Would it be a better way if I embed Mono runtime(mono.exe) in my
application?
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Embedding_Mono">http://www.mono-project.com/Embedding_Mono</A>
In addition, I checked out mkbundle.exe to realize that it is for Linux only
that is unable to use it for Win32 or MacOSX.

Second question:
While Mono.exe startup, it would search '\mono\2.0\' path for 'mscorlib.dll'
even if I write code such as: mono_set_dirs(&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;) to change its search
path.
I tried to place 'mscorlib.dll' in the same directory with my application
EXE but it's not worked and the assembly can't be found.
How could I do it right?


Any comments/suggestions would be much appreciated. Thanks in advanced.

Regards.
