<PRE>Hi Bjarke,

&gt;<i> I have taken a look at 0.4.3, and you are correct that it can read and

</I>&gt;<i> Cecil in SVN. Specifically MS peverify gives the following complaint 
</I>&gt;<i> when I run it on the output:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [IL]: Error: [E:\net\o.exe : Bug::Main][offset 0x00000007] Handler

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I can tell the problem is rather the handler end than the 
</I>&gt;<i> start, but maybe I am wrong (I can't inspect it manually as ildasm does 
</I>&gt;<i> not display what the actual ranges are, probably because in this case 
</I>&gt;<i> the handler is invalid).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe I have tracked the problem down to the following method in 
</I>&gt;<i> CodeWriter.cs:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> int GetLength (Instruction start, Instruction end, Instruction last)
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i>     return (end == null ? last.Offset + last.OpCode.Size : end.Offset) - 
</I>&gt;<i> start.Offset;
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I have been able to figure out, OpCode.Size is only the size 
</I>&gt;<i> of the opcode itself - it does not include any parameters that follow 
</I>&gt;<i> the opcode. Thus the ending offset is miscalculated in case the last 
</I>&gt;<i> instruction in the method has any parameters, and that instruction is 
</I>&gt;<i> also the last instruction in an exception handler.
</I>
Hmm, interesting, I'll have a look at that soon. Thanks for the test case!

&gt;<i> The thing is, I am not sure how ranges are handled in Cecil. I think it 
</I>&gt;<i> works like this: all ranges of instructions are represented as half open 
</I>&gt;<i> intervals [start, end), where start and end are pointers to actual 
</I>&gt;<i> Instructions. start and end can be null if they are past the last 
</I>&gt;<i> instruction. Is this correct?
</I>
Yes it is. But we expect that only the end could be pointing after the 
last instruction. If start is null then we have a real problem.

&gt;&gt;<i> Cecil does not preserve the .rsrc (aka Win32 resources) section or the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PE file for the moment. So it saves some place.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What are the consequences of this other than smaller assemblies?
</I>
We can not add stuff like Win32 icons, or any kind of Win32 resources to 
the assembly. Korn&#233;l already wrote some stuff to handle that in mcs and 
ilasm, thought I'm not sure I want to include his code which very 
complete, but also kind of large.
