		[Accidentally sent this to Sebastien only the first time...]

I've used NAnt quite a bit at work to build
continuous integration / automated distribution build systems for a few
projects here.  I'll take a look at getting a patch that does this for
Gendarme tonight.  The only sticking point will be that it needs to
build on both Windows and Linux systems without modifications to the
build files themselves.  NAnt officially supports Mono 1.0 and 2.0
profiles, so perhaps it won't be that &quot;magic&quot; to get this to happen.

In
addition, VS2005's native project format uses MSBuild (part of the .NET
2.0 FCL, if I'm not mistaken).  Is there any status on the stability or
completeness of Mono's implementation of the MSBuild system?  It'd be
pretty nice to have only two build systems to maintain - make for
Linux/Cygwin, or MSBuild for Linux/Cygwin/VS.NET/Windows CLI.  I don't
have even a working knowledge of MSBuild in general, however, so this
may be pure pie-in-the-sky wishing on my part :)

Hello Christian,

Using the Makefile should work using cygwin (and I can't believe I'm
suggesting cygwin to someone ;-)

</I>
I understand this issue, which is why I'm open to a third build system.
But, like I said, I don't have any NAnt knowledge myself so someone else
needs to step up for it ;-)

Why ? because once this is in SVN/tarballs people will expect it to be
maintained (even if I write &quot;use at your own risk&quot; in the README).

&gt;<i> Since I'm not that involved in other projects - how do other handle
</I>&gt;<i> this issue with &quot;build files&quot;?
</I>
I suspect they each build their own project file (e.g. in VS.NET) and
yes this is clearly inefficient.

Now one of my computers is a WinXP box with VS.NET 2005, so I may take
the time to create a VS.NET solution in the future as, somehow, it make
sense &quot;test-wise&quot; and commit it into SVN (if there is demand for it).

But I'm still open to a contributor-supported NAnt build ;-)
