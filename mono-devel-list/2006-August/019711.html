<PRE>Thanks for the info Robert! I continue inline...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, it says it is alpha and unsupported software.

Yes, it's referenced in the URL I gave previously but, of course, I am 
primarily looking for a non-commercial solution.

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.thinktecture.com/Resources/RemotingFAQ/RemotingUseCases.html">http://www.thinktecture.com/Resources/RemotingFAQ/RemotingUseCases.html</A>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Thanks for the extra info. I will have a look.

However, in case you're interested, now I am investigating this one 
(which I haven't managed to make it work yet but I suspect the reason is 
that I am running it with 2.0 Framework and I should use 1.1 or update 
the sources...):

<A HREF="http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/reachability.asp?df=100&amp;forumid=15864&amp;exp=0&amp;select=540926">http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/reachability.asp?df=100&amp;forumid=15864&amp;exp=0&amp;select=540926</A>

The author states that it supports pure bi-directional communication 
using Remoting (it's only a new channel type implementation like the one 
from Ingo), and that it's even simpler (&quot;more lightweight&quot; is the exact 
term used) than the Genuine Channels.

The only things I haven't clarified yet is the license of the code (I 
don't find it, although the fact of being published at codeproject 
smells that it's LGPL-like or at least GPL-like) and the scalability 
which I could support with this method. Hopefully I will post here my 
results if I go further, in case anyone would be interested.

Regards.
