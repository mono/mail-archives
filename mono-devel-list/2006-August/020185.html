The only inflammatory bit was saying that I didn't like the SULF API.

Which is about as inflammatory as saying Java collections suck (no
language integration like System.Array integration
System.Collections.IList), that System.Windows.Forms sucks, and that
System.Diagnostics.EventLog sucks...

&gt;<i> The SULF project you reference predates the FUSE low-level API and

</I>
As I asked in your separate message, *where* is this new SULF you
reference?

Furthermore, the SULF project I referenced makes use of the FUSE
low-level API, at least that's what the ChangeLog and associated web
site says &quot;The Fuse.dll library communicates with the FUSE kernel
module,&quot; which would be the low-level FUSE API...

&gt;<i> 1. ask about the state of SULF.  I would not have recommended starting
</I>&gt;<i> with this defunct project,  nor recommended referencing it as an
</I>&gt;<i> alternative.
</I>
The SULF site I referenced (<A HREF="http://arg0.net/users/vgough/sulf/">http://arg0.net/users/vgough/sulf/</A>) is the
top-most linked site at the time I was searching.

The SULF site I referenced is *still* the site listed in the FUSE Wiki:
<A HREF="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/LanguageBindings">http://fuse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/LanguageBindings</A>

Short of emailing you, I have no idea how I was supposed to find
anything more recent, especially since these older sites, which
presumably you still control, could have been updated to at least say
&quot;this has been deprecated, please see the newer library _here_.&quot;

BTW, this would *still* be a good idea.

&gt;<i> 3. search this Mono list for FUSE related announcements
</I>
Searching my multi-year mono-list history for all messages with &quot;FUSE&quot;
in the subject brings up:

    &quot;Re: [Mono-list] mod_mono MAKE confused on Apache version&quot;
      - obvious match for &quot;fuse&quot; as a substring, not relevant
    &quot;[Mono-list] ANN: Linux filesystems in C# (FUSE wrapper)&quot;
      - Dated May 12, 2005, by Valient Gough &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">valient at gmail.com</A>&gt;
      - References <A HREF="http://pobox.com/~vgough/sulf">http://pobox.com/~vgough/sulf</A>
      - ...which redirects to <A HREF="http://arg0.net/users/vgough/sulf/">http://arg0.net/users/vgough/sulf/</A>

A *new* search (this morning) also brings up fusewrapper,
<A HREF="http://arg0.net/wiki/fusewrapper,">http://arg0.net/wiki/fusewrapper,</A> so I assume this is the newer library

BTW, I see no messages with &quot;fusewrapper&quot; in the subject on either
mono-list or mono-devel-list.
