I'm big on Single Points Of Truth. :-)

MonoPosixHelper *already* contains code to convert `struct stat' and
`struct statvfs' into a Mono.Unix.Native.Stat &amp; Mono.Unix.Native.Statvfs
(and code for several other structures).  `struct statvfs' in particular
has lots of code to deal with Linux &amp; Mac OS X/*BSD (which use a `struct
statfs' for the same purpose -- so much for portability!).

So removing a dependency on the Mono.Posix changes would require copying
this existing code, introducing *two* &quot;points of truth,&quot; which I dislike
(the &quot;bad taste in my mouth&quot; design opinion).

In short, I'd prefer to avoid copy &amp; pasting code unless it can't be
avoided, and this most certainly *can* be avoided.  (Plus, as lupus
mentioned earlier, if the conversion functions are not added to
Mono.Posix then it &quot;is useless for all but the trivial cases,&quot; and I'm
trying to *improve* its usefulness, not keep it useless for all but the
currently support cases.)

(Recall why I started this: I wondered why Sulf didn't use Mono.Posix,
and came to the conclusion that it *couldn't* use Mono.Posix because
Mono.Posix didn't offer the required functionality.)
