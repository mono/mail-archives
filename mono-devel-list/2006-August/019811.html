<PRE>Yea I found how to edit the .mdp file while searching around the other
day, and it did work.  I also found how to generate a tarball in
monodevelop, but for some reason, it only worked as root, which isn't a
big deal.  I think deployment project templates (in MD) and overall
application development should be addressed further.  The world is
getting comfy using RPM/deb/* type binary packages, and I think it
would be a step back to limit apps written in C#/Mono to tarball
deployment; especially in the 'Next-&gt;Next-&gt;Finish' world of Windows.  I
also think that while xcopy simplifies a lot of things, it's not a great
solution to deployment, especially in Windows systems.

Personally, I would like to quickly generate installation packages that
provide menu entries in the users respective desktop environments
applications menu, as well as proper file location/layout.  I certainly
would never expect end users of my software to compile my applications
from source code; I think it's unprofessional and a bit lame, unless my
app is targeted towards developers (like mono*), which in this case it
isn't specifically in this instance.  IMHO, Rapid Application
Development isn't only about a great runtime and a great lanaguage to
accompany it; it's also about getting your software to your customers
_rapidly_.

I also kind of feel like there's way to big of a disconnect between mono
and monodevelop (the mono runtime is almost feature complete, at version
.11, MD is .89 hundreths away from a 1.0 release ^_^ ); there wouldn't
be as many .NET apps in the world today without the awe inspiring
muscle of Visual Studio.NET, but that's probably for another
discussion.
