<PRE>Well, I wouldn't have a MD limited view... I really appreciate the 
impressive
work those folks have done but... I think it would have had a much possitive
impact if instead of MD we would have now a decent Eclipse plugin for
C#.

&gt;<i> Problem is, there are a ton of things MD needs right now like:
</I>&gt;<i> - Debugger
</I>&gt;<i> - SCM integration
</I>&gt;<i> - More deployment options
</I>&gt;<i> - Support for all language features implemented in mono (like generics)
</I>
Look, we are developing a new SCM system (all .NET, almost all running on 
Linux),
so I have a SCM-centric view... nevertheless I think: SCM Integration: you 
can
live without it.  You can do checkout/checkin on the command line, and it 
won't
probably have a big impact on your development time...

&gt;<i> So which one is more important?
</I>
Debugger. In fact, I would even write code with an editor, compile from the
command line... whatever, if I only had a strong GUI-Debugger. For me,
the bare minimum is (ok, scm, editor and so on) having a good debugger.

It doesn't make sense having the most (or one of the mosts) powerful
development platform for unix-based OS if you have to debug with
Console.WriteLine (or log4net, whatever) like twenty years ago...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have just downloaded the vmware machine, and I liked the appearance of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> monodevelop application. We are currently trying to finish our user
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interface built on Windows Forms, adapting from Windows, and I liked the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> monodevelop looks much more.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Still, our project is about 100K c# loc, and we would really like to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> develop
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on Linux, because we really want to support the platform. Developing on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Windows and testing on both platforms is what we have been doing for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> months
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but, is not the same as having some developers working on Linux (plus, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of us would really like to work with another OS).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Our problem: we don't have a proper debugger. We wanted to move to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Xdevelop,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but constant debugger changes make debugging on Linux almost impossible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, how do you guys manage to develop on Linux. I mean, not having a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> debugger has a deep impact in the development, everything gets slower. It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be great having one. Is it installed by default with monodevelop on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the VMWare machine? I didn't find it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IMHO having a strong debugger, integrated with a strong IDE (even 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Eclipse),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would really boost Mono adoption. Ok, you guys know better, just what I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think. Mono/.NET is the best development technology I know (and I was 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reluctant at the beginning). Only remoting gives power to build great
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> software, and performance is very good too (remind COM :-( ). Even not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> having reached 1.2, functionallity is wide enough to build full 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> functional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> systems. Adding functionality, again IMHO, shouldn't be a concern. So, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sure debugger/IDE (and again taking a strong one could be the way to go, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not reinventing the wheel), would be a huge step ahead.
