<PRE>Hi, everyone!

We are developing a server application (or suite of applications) that will 
receive requests from clients, run database queries to fulfill those 
requests, and then return the datasets with the results.  The server will 
continually receive these requests from all over the internet.  We'd like to 
use Mono so we can run our server software on our Windows workstations while 
we develop and debug it but then deploy the software on a linux server when 
we're ready to go live.

Has anyone here had success doing this sort of thing?  Mono has been around 
a while, but I have heard from someone that it's not stable enough yet for a 
large, commercial server.  I've heard from other sources that it is great 
for that already.  Naturally, I want to make sure it'll work before 
commiting to it!

Thanks!
-Tom
