Well, that's odd. I was almost certain .NET 1.1 did the same thing. It seems 
only natural. I once had to write a set of RealProxies, and one of the ways I 
got the biggest performance boost out of the Framework was to handle the Object 
methods locally. (Particularly GetType, as that is used by the ServiceContainer 
class, but it seems that's not exactly right, given Microsoft's list.)

I'll file the bug anyways, but it's probably not the magic bullet I thought it 
was. I'm reasonably sure, though, that XSP's performance shouldn't be as heavily 
tied to remoting performance as people have made it sound.
