<PRE>Hi!

2006/8/18, Robert Jordan &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">robertj at gmx.net</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Hey,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why do I have to deduce from other of your posts what you're
</I>&gt;<i> trying to do? :-) Please try to be more detailed.
</I>
Sorry about that, you did fine job crawling those posts though :)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I understand you have a server app which embeds mono (under Windows)
</I>&gt;<i> and which sometimes acts as a *WebService client*.
</I>&gt;<i> At least I can deduce this from the trace and from your previous mails.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That is correct. That's also almost the same text I wrote in my previous post :)

&gt;<i> Now to the bug: Web servers usually deny more then 2 open
</I>&gt;<i> connections from a specific client. Since your server
</I>&gt;<i> acts on behalf of its clients, you're probably somehow
</I>&gt;<i> reaching the limit.
</I>
After reading your reply I thought that this must have been the
reason. So I set up a web server to my machine and tried accessing one
service from there. First went ok, but second attempt gave &quot;The
request timed out&quot; message. First and successful attempt was logged in
web server but there was no trace of the second one.

I think that the reason I thought that program froze earlier was
because I tried accessing public server and it just kept waiting so
long.

But it definitely looks like Mono is trying to do something but fails?
