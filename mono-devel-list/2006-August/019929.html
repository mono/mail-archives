I think it would indeed be better to either build it at compile time, or if
is too difficult to achieve (especially on linux) that we can always embed
it. Or as a (very) last resort, do not register one for event sources
created from Mono.

&gt;<i> &gt; In what form should EventLogMessage.dll added to svn (and the source

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it at compile time ?

</I>&gt;<i> Please excuse my ignorance, but why on earth do we need

</I>
It's definitely not needed, but Korn&#233;l proposed to use it on unix too.  IT
would be nice to have, but not necessary.

On Windows, I think we should definitely use it. But there it's also not
strictly necessary (but more than one unix).

&gt;<i> I understand why it's needed for Win32 and even why
</I>&gt;<i> Win32 demands it (performance and log file size optimization), but
</I>&gt;<i> since MS.NET installs EventLogMessage.dll, no one will ever use

</I>
In .NET 2.0, MS provided better support for using message resource dll's, so
I'm pretty sure its usage will pick up.

Reading event entries created by event sources that use a message resource
has already been implemented (for the win32 implementation).
