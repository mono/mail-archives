Yes.  It's called ClickOnce deployment, requires Code Access Security,
and won't be happening with Mono anytime before 2.0 (iirc).

Also, it should be noted that .NET 1.0 allowed you to use SWF components
as if they were ActiveX controls.  I forget the details, but it only
required Internet Explorer and a .NET 1.0+ installation on the client.
