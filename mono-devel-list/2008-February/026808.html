Not as easy as you'd think; check the archives with the &quot;Control-C
handler&quot; subject.  To reliably catch SIGINT/SIGTERM/etc., you'll need to
use UnixSignal, which was just added to svn-HEAD.  If I'm lucky, I'll
get the tests written to permit it to go into 1.9 soon.

&gt;<i> 4. Environment.UserInteractive should be false when run as a service

</I>&gt;<i> What does &quot;interactive&quot; mean in mono? ...  In Unix, it's unclear: even

</I>
Mono itself doesn't close stdin, stdout, or stderr, so even a
mono-service-based app will still have stdin/stdout/stderr (unless/until
mono-service actually closes those file descriptors).

&gt;<i> I would be happy to submit a fix for Environment.UserInteractive, but
</I>&gt;<i> it's not obvious how we should do it.  Would checking for a valid
</I>&gt;<i> stdin work?
</I>
Unless mono-service is modified to close stdin, this won't work.

&gt;<i>   Or maybe it should always be true except when
</I>&gt;<i> mono-service explicitly makes it false somehow?
</I>
This makes more sense.

&gt;<i>   Does mono-service
</I>&gt;<i> have access to internal methods that would let it poke at environment
</I>&gt;<i> settings like that?
</I>
You can [DllImport(&quot;__Internal&quot;)] to obtain functions within the mono
executable, or (better) you can add an internal call to Mono that
mono-service would make use of.  Environment.UserInteractive could then
use a different internal call to obtain the value of some variable,
permitting communication (via internal calls) between mono-service and
System.Environment.  This is likely the best solution.
