<PRE>from the executable file.&quot;

It also makes not that this is the same trick VB prior to .NET generates
executables and handles it runtime.

In any event, to support it wholesale would be quite a task since not all
Unix environments are ELF supported or x86.  I am a little interested in
&quot;native to native&quot; though.  If you are building assemblies and executibles
on Linux for running on Linux there should be a way to take a shortcut
just like this.  Make the ELF header execute the mono IL interpeter using
itself as data.  It sure won't be portable non-ELF systems and I'm iffy on
whether or not it will work on non-x86 ELF systems.

I'm not saying to make this a mainline feature in the mcs compiler but
possible slate it in as an advance platform specific feature for future
versions.
