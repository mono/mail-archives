See attached test program.  It works if all Stdlib.raise() calls are
from the same thread.

...and it fails if I use Syscall.kill() to send the signal, or I use
multiple threads to call Stdlib.raise().  (Stdlib.raise() invocation is
synchronous, hence it works if only one thread calls it.)

When using Syscall.kill() or Stdlib.raise() concurrently from multiple
threads, I lose signals, presumably because the signal handler is being
invoked simultaneously (Core2 Duo CPU) and the handler isn't thread
safe.

So now I'm at a quandry: I can't make the signal handler thread-safe as
Pthreads functions aren't signal-safe, yet we're requiring the ability
to invoke the signal handler from multiple threads.

So obviously things go &quot;bad&quot;.

The only fix I can think of is to not use &quot;++h-&gt;count&quot; within the signal
handler, but to instead use an atomic function like g_atomic_int_inc(),
but that doesn't solve the problem either -- signals are still missed.
(I'm frankly surprised that g_atomic_int_inc() isn't fixing this, as two
threads trying to increment the count is the only reason I can think of
for why signals would be missed.)

Any suggestions on a solution?

Thanks,
 - Jon
