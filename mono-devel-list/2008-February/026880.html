  1)      Masked text box does not mask, so the password is displayed in clear text.  The applications is a exam program and after the subject reads the instructions, an instructor comes over and types in a password to continue with the exam. So the client will certainly see the password as it is typed in.
  2)      The form has a property set to fill the screen. It stays at the size it was created at.
  3)      We can&#146;t show a cursor because it would be a distraction. I get around that by have a textbox of minimum size. After the form has been shown, I set focus to it, and in the textbox leave event, I reset the focus to the textbox. This works in windows, but in Linux, the cursor leaves the text box. This may be because the form is not maximized.
  4)      Most instruction screens are blank. I think it is because the text is in a rich text box.
  
  

Plesae file independent bugs for each of these issues and we'll work towards getting them fixed for you.  Please file them with testcases (C# preferred)
  

  Thanks,
