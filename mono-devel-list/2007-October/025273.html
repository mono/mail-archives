<PRE>Hello All.

Can anyone give me a guestimate on the effort to port the mono runtime
to an embedded PowerPC system (Wii and maybe even 360 if MS's 360 CLR
doesn't stack up) and/or any hints as to what that would entail?  We are
considering going this route so that we could use C# for the scripting
needs in our games instead of Lua (what we are currently using and
finding quite unsatisfactory) or a hypothetical home-brew dynamic
language.  I've read through <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Porting">http://www.mono-project.com/Porting</A> and
everything it says sounds straight forward, but the sentence &quot;If the OS
doesn't support POSIX and the standard libc calls, you'll likely have to
make changes in many places&quot; has me concerned.  Not only does the Wii
lack posix support for things like disk IO, it doesn't even have a
harddrive.  Ideally, what we would end up with is a tool chain running
under Windows that can build native Wii code out of a (restricted
subset) of a CLR assembly and statically link that with a Wii port of
the runtime.  No JIT, no dynamic loading of assemblies, etc.

I realize that this is a absurdly open-ended question, but it's the
question I need to come up with an answer to.  Even responses along the
lines of &quot;that's phycho -- it would take man-years&quot; or &quot;a smart dude w/
compiler and language runtime experience could pull it off in a
couple-three months&quot; would be helpful.

Thanks,
