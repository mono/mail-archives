Yes, I have used kcachegrind, and I absolutely loved it :-)
For now the priority is to be able to output files as small
as possible, and with as little overhead as possible.

Then, &lt;hint&gt;somebody could contribute&lt;/hint&gt; an off line
translator from our file format to kcachegrind's ;-)

Another thing I would like is integrating oprofile support in
this profiler. The oprofile team just created a branch which
provides Java support, but the JIT support is vm-agnostic and
it would be easy to make it support Mono.

BTW, I just rerun the bench test enabling only the (broken)
statistical profiler support, even if it does not provide
meaningful data.
This way the log file is small and the overhead ok.
The log file was so huge because with all the flags enabled it
was actually like a full trace...

Ciao,
  Massi
