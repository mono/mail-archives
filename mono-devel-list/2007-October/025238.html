<PRE>Sebastien,

&gt;<i> No. The short story is that &quot;it's a big, long and costly project&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> that there's been, so far, not many demand for it (wrt to other Mono
</I>&gt;<i> features).
</I>
I agree that there are more pressing needs, but it never hurts to voice
your
own so they are recognized.  I am a big Mono proponent, but it is
difficult
to compete with Java on maturity of tools.  

&gt;<i> While it's less elegant (imho) you can still use FIPS140 certified
</I>&gt;<i> crypto in Mono by wrapping an existing toolkit (e.g. nss) in C# [1]
</I>and
&gt;<i> using this as a replacement [2] for Mono's crypto (split in both
</I>&gt;<i> Mono.Security and mscorlib).
</I>
The Java community has JSS.  Would asking for a MonoSS be asking too
much?
That seems like a big project as well.  This is not even what I am
really
looking for.  I need SSH.  I found the capability in SharpSSH, but in
order
for me to make certification labs happy, I need the encryption used in
my
SSH implementation to be FIPS 140 compliant.

&gt;<i> [1] which is exactly what MS is doing on Windows: the FIPS140 crypto
</I>&gt;<i> comes from CryptoAPI (managed stuff isn't certified) and wrapped in
</I>the
&gt;<i> class library.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [2] it's possible to remap cryptographic algorithms using
</I>machine.config
&gt;<i> (so all mono tools and *correctly* written applications/libraries will
</I>&gt;<i> be using your own crypto).
</I>
That is nice for Windows, but I am targeting Linux.  I would love to
point
some config file at NSS.  Is there any chance such a thing will happen?

I am a little peon doing R&amp;D hoping to move the Army toward accepting
Mono.
Any help you can give me would be much appreciated!

Many Thanks,
