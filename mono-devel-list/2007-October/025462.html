<PRE>Ok, I agree whith you about the FLite approach, what do you thing about 
MBrola and FestVox? or they have more restricted licences?. I think that 
FreTTS is also a god choice, becouse is java and probably more easy 
traslate to a complete managed TTS engine, and also may be provide 
compatibility with Microsoft's Synthesis API.

Cheers
Mauricio

</I>&gt;<i> I think we should consider approaching &quot;managed text-to-speech&quot; from 
</I>&gt;<i> the side of Flite instead of Festival (I think lupus actually 
</I>&gt;<i> suggested this when I was first discussing it on #mono, but I 
</I>&gt;<i> foolishly went ahead with trying for Festival anyways). The one core 
</I>&gt;<i> thing I started to do with my wrapper (from here out referred to as 
</I>&gt;<i> Tao.Festival) was provide support for both a server-oriented Festival 
</I>&gt;<i> interface, i.e. connecting on the Festival's port (1234 I believe) and 
</I>&gt;<i> then performing the commands, or using a C#-&gt;C-&gt;C++ wrapper I had 
</I>&gt;<i> written to take advantage of libFestival.a which is usually installed 
</I>&gt;<i> on most Linux systems when the Festival package is added. I had not 
</I>&gt;<i> started on the server-oriented code yet, but had the wrappers in place 
</I>&gt;<i> for relying on libFestival which proved to be &quot;a stupid idea&quot; and 
</I>&gt;<i> will/would cause the entire Mono process to SIGSEGV every single time 
</I>&gt;<i> because of some of the intricacies to native platform interop with 
</I>&gt;<i> code that's *so* expectant on being statically linked *always* as 
</I>&gt;<i> Festival is. I can upload the code to my anonymous Subversion 
</I>&gt;<i> repository, but I think it's only worth it from a &quot;research&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> perspective in seeing why exactly Festival is a bad route to go with :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our end goal is easy to define I think, ideally we would want to 
</I>&gt;<i> provide developers with the following calls:
</I>&gt;<i>     Mono.Speech.SayText(&quot;Hello Monkeys!&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i>     Mono.Speech.SayText(&quot;Hello Monkeys!&quot;, FileStream, 
</I>&gt;<i> Mono.Speech.WaveFileType);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest you look at the following for an idea on why Flite will be 
</I>&gt;<i> far easier:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will try to port my existing design of Tao.Festival over to 
</I>&gt;<i> something more Flite-based this weekend, at the very least to evaluate 
</I>&gt;<i> whether or not Flite will truly be a better option than Festival, and 
</I>&gt;<i> to evaluate whether the concept will *actually* work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As much as I would love to be able to provide compatibility with 
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft's new System.Speech.Synthesis API, I just don't think that's 
</I>&gt;<i> ever going to be possible given the state of open source speech 
</I>&gt;<i> synthesis systems (unless somebody writes a fully managed one on Mono 
</I>&gt;<i> of course :)). So maybe would should just strive for providing 
</I>&gt;<i> something that Gtk# developers can use, specifically in some of the 
</I>&gt;<i> applications Novell includes in their SUSE distribution (how cool 
</I>&gt;<i> would it be for Banshee to tell you what song it's &quot;spinning up&quot; next 
</I>&gt;<i> like a DJ!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm tremendously busy during the week, but I'll post something this 
</I>&gt;<i> weekend after I'm able to set aside some time to get back to TTS and 
</I>&gt;<i> wrapping crazy interop code around legacy C (Flite's last release was 
</I>&gt;<i> almost 3 and a half years ago).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Glad to see somebody else is interested though! :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> -R. Tyler Ballance
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> p.s.  using Apple's Carbon APIs for Speech Synthesis, this 
</I>&gt;<i> hypothetical Mono.Speech API could also work on Mac OS X :-D
