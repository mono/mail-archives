<PRE>Hello,

Can anyone give me a guestimate on the effort to port the mono runtime
&gt;<i> to an embedded PowerPC system (Wii and maybe even 360 if MS's 360 CLR
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't stack up) and/or any hints as to what that would entail?
</I>

Unfortunately,  I don't have enough knowledge to give an opinion on this ...


We are
&gt;<i> considering going this route so that we could use C# for the scripting
</I>&gt;<i> needs in our games instead of Lua (what we are currently using and
</I>&gt;<i> finding quite unsatisfactory) or a hypothetical home-brew dynamic
</I>

.. but I became interested in this &quot;limitations&quot; of Lua because I also work
with it ... can you point out some problems that you have ?
