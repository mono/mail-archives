</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry to disapoint you, but my wrapper is not even a &quot;server&quot; call
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the festival TTS, is more cheating :-), is only a wrapper for a C
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; shared library that send the correct &quot;echo $MESSAGE | festival --
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tts&quot; :-) , I also see the posibility to try a more sofisticate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wrapper, but as you say is to much complicate, so this is a working
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; approach :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A novel approach to say the least, but I agree, it's not great, but
</I>&gt;<i> it's a start :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I attach the C shared library and the C# wraper with a simple test
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; program.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; May be we can work in a better wrapper.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also agree on this :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we should consider approaching &quot;managed text-to-speech&quot; from
</I>&gt;<i> the side of Flite instead of Festival (I think lupus actually
</I>&gt;<i> suggested this when I was first discussing it on #mono, but I
</I>&gt;<i> foolishly went ahead with trying for Festival anyways). The one core
</I>&gt;<i> thing I started to do with my wrapper (from here out referred to as
</I>&gt;<i> Tao.Festival) was provide support for both a server-oriented Festival
</I>&gt;<i> interface, i.e. connecting on the Festival's port (1234 I believe) and
</I>&gt;<i> then performing the commands, or using a C#-&gt;C-&gt;C++ wrapper I had
</I>&gt;<i> written to take advantage of libFestival.a which is usually installed
</I>&gt;<i> on most Linux systems when the Festival package is added. I had not
</I>&gt;<i> started on the server-oriented code yet, but had the wrappers in place
</I>&gt;<i> for relying on libFestival which proved to be &quot;a stupid idea&quot; and will/
</I>&gt;<i> would cause the entire Mono process to SIGSEGV every single time
</I>&gt;<i> because of some of the intricacies to native platform interop with
</I>&gt;<i> code that's *so* expectant on being statically linked *always* as
</I>&gt;<i> Festival is. I can upload the code to my anonymous Subversion
</I>&gt;<i> repository, but I think it's only worth it from a &quot;research&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> perspective in seeing why exactly Festival is a bad route to go with :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our end goal is easy to define I think, ideally we would want to
</I>&gt;<i> provide developers with the following calls:
</I>&gt;<i>         Mono.Speech.SayText(&quot;Hello Monkeys!&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i>         Mono.Speech.SayText(&quot;Hello Monkeys!&quot;, FileStream,
</I>&gt;<i> Mono.Speech.WaveFileType);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest you look at the following for an idea on why Flite will be
</I>&gt;<i> far easier:
</I>&gt;<i>         <A HREF="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite/doc/flite_7.html#SEC17">http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite/doc/flite_7.html#SEC17</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will try to port my existing design of Tao.Festival over to
</I>&gt;<i> something more Flite-based this weekend, at the very least to evaluate
</I>&gt;<i> whether or not Flite will truly be a better option than Festival, and
</I>&gt;<i> to evaluate whether the concept will *actually* work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As much as I would love to be able to provide compatibility with
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft's new System.Speech.Synthesis API, I just don't think that's
</I>&gt;<i> ever going to be possible given the state of open source speech
</I>&gt;<i> synthesis systems (unless somebody writes a fully managed one on Mono
</I>&gt;<i> of course :)). So maybe would should just strive for providing
</I>&gt;<i> something that Gtk# developers can use, specifically in some of the
</I>&gt;<i> applications Novell includes in their SUSE distribution (how cool
</I>&gt;<i> would it be for Banshee to tell you what song it's &quot;spinning up&quot; next
</I>&gt;<i> like a DJ!)
</I>
If you are looking for a fully managed solution, you could look at
FreeTTS &lt;<A HREF="http://freetts.sourceforge.net">http://freetts.sourceforge.net</A>&gt;, which is a (from memory
Sun-backed) port of flite to Java.  It's supposed to be considerably
faster than flite and may provide a good base for a .NET version
(IKVM, C#, or whatever else).
