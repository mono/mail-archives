<PRE>Hey Mirco,

&gt;<i> Ah, this is good to know who maintains that installer. I tried the 2.10
</I>&gt;<i> installer once and ran into real problems and could not find the correct
</I>&gt;<i> contact for it.
</I>
We're currently trying to track down some crashers we're seeing with
PerformQueuedUnrefs () in Gtk# 2.10.2 with TreeModelSort, so I wouldn't
recommend using the 2.10 series on Windows at this point.  Our
application is running fine with our 2.8 series of installers though.

&gt;<i> So here the problem I encountered (I have no idea if that applies to the
</I>&gt;<i> current installer):
</I>&gt;<i> The 2.10 installer seems to miss policy files for 2.4, IIRC only 2.6 and
</I>&gt;<i> 2.8 where present. This made it a no go for us, as all applications
</I>&gt;<i> where referenced with 2.4 at that time.
</I>
We've never provided policy files for 2.4 since it seemed old enough to
not be necessary, but if you'd like, I'd be happy to add those in the
next version we release.

&gt;<i> So then we uninstalled gtk# 2.10 which didn't remove all installed
</I>&gt;<i> policy files. That made it impossible to get paco's gtk# 2.4 or gtk# 2.8
</I>&gt;<i> working again with those stalled policy files. I could not find a way to
</I>&gt;<i> remove the policy files by hand from the GAC, so we used windows
</I>&gt;<i> recovery to let the gtk# 2.10 install &quot;unhappen&quot;.
</I>
In the early Gtk# 2.10 transition, I accidentally forgot to ungac policy
dlls, but as of 2.10.1-1, you shouldn't be seeing any problems.  As
usual, if you have any specific issues with installers, please direct
them to me, and I'll help you out.

&gt;<i> But now I would reconsider testing the gtk# 2.10 installer :)
</I>
I really wouldn't recommend it at this point due to the bug that we're
seeing.  However, it may just be our application doing something
naughty.


Cheers,

-Brad
