<PRE>On the other hand, just today I received an email with this text:

 

            It is C# based (some of the code uses .Net 2.0 features so it's
not mono-ready code). The editor .

 

I tried out the tool and aside from some typical path issues, the app ran
great.  Kudos to the WinForms developers!  Is there any way to get MoMA to
do some Cecil magic and fix path issues?  2 Points for evaluate, but you
really get extra credit for remediate!  Developers in the Windows world just
don't realize how mature Mono already is.  When Mono did generics I would
already have called it 2.0.  I would have made all the disclaimers needed,
but people need to know that Mono works!  We can shrink the list of
disclaimers as progress is made.  It is a question of degree of
compatibility and IMO there is enough.  When I can copy an exe and it just
works, I may move my project over to Mono and add the missing functionality
I need myself (the Mono dream).

 

Thanks,

 

Vlad

I think the only way to minimise confusion in the developer population that
does not keep up-to-date with the details of development on Mono is to let
at least the major version track full .NET compatibility. That is, do not
move to v2.x.x until at least .NET 2.0 can be fully supported, do not move
to v3.x.x until at least .NET 3.0 can be fully supported and maybe even do
not move to v3.5.x until .NET 3.5 is supported. 

People that are aware of what is really going on under the hood will be able
to make more detailed judgement calls and will not really care what version
numbering you exactly use. It's the people that do not glance further than
the version number that need to be accomodated.
