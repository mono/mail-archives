<PRE>Hi :)

</I>&gt;<i> It is great that you are interested in hacking this area :-)

</I>&gt;<i> You can start either based on unfinished SoC effort or from
</I>&gt;<i> scratch (as you wrote, the existing code is not advanced much).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, since System.Messaging.dll is not part of our supported
</I>&gt;<i> component, you can directly work with mono svn. IMO even
</I>&gt;<i> trunk is still fine (I'll take care of the dll's metadata-wise
</I>&gt;<i> mismatch) but you might also want to create your own branch.
</I>

Okay, I will do just that.

(I noticed that the latest data loss disaster at the hosting
&gt;<i> service I used also hit my code.
</I>

That sucks!!!

So the links at the wiki page
&gt;<i> results in 404, but I could restore only the patch from archive.org
</I>&gt;<i> and it actually lacked OpenWireBridge.cs, though it should not be
</I>&gt;<i> hard to rewrite from scratch.)
</I>

Yeah, it seems pretty straight forward, and in fact have already started in
on getting some of the core functionality pieces pulled together.  I am
currently in &quot;head down and code mode&quot; getting ready to deliver this[1]
platform (which, by the way, is a completely portable personal web
communication and publishing system, the same system I've been building in
stages for the last three and half years, built directly on top of and
powered by Mono) which is powering this[2] site which will be launched in 11
days @ the College Music Journal Festival[3] in New York City on the 16th.
 When I get back from that event I will be placing all of my focus on
building out System.Messaging, so expect to hear back from me in regards to
both status and questions soon thereafter.

Thanks, Eno!
