<PRE>Hello,
     Here's the start of what is needed to get mono working on Win64. The
patch doesn't complete the port, but it's a start and I wanted to try and
get something incremental rather than just waiting for the whole patch. I
could use the most review in mini-amd64.c. Note that where argument
registers need accessed, I have tried to use AMD64_ARG_REG#. There may be
additional places I need to convert over, or more likely a few of the places
I converted should not have been. Also, this is a large patch. If there is a
logical way I could break this down to make it easier to review, please let
me know.
     For anyone interested, I am using eglib (as there is no Win64 glib
port). I only had to make a few patches to it to make it usable. I'll send
these in shortly as well. Also, this is all being done in VS 2005 as there
is no gcc for Win64 (AFAIK).

Thanks,
Jonathan
