<PRE>I am also hoping for webcasts of some kind.  

As a member of the Mono community, I feel a sense of pride whenever Mono
gains respect on the Linux platform.  As a consequence, I am hoping that
more &quot;must have&quot; applications get developed with Mono.  Whether it is games,
tools or whatever, I truly love to hear that developers are having success
with Mono.  Java is the Honda of the market.  It sells itself.  Maybe we
need a proselytizing campaign?  To misquote Rodney Dangerfield &quot;How can we
get some respect around here?&quot;

A big concern of mine is penetration on RHEL.  This is a very large user
community and it seems to have diplomatic issues with Mono.  Can this be
resolved?  

* Moonlight/Boo/DLR
I am cautiously curious about the Moonlets (the Moonlight desktop apps).
Let's face it; sex sells and if it becomes easy to make sexy apps, everyone
will use this technology.  Will it become easy?  

Mono is becoming more and more efficient with memory.  I would love to hear
some plans to join with OpenMoko, GNOME (<A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/mobile/">http://www.gnome.org/mobile/</A>), etc
on the embedded front.  There is Java ME, where is our competing offering?

Will working on the Mac spread core developers too thin?  Should we stick to
Gtk and get that right first?

Vlad

P.S. Thanks for all the hard work from Miguel, his team at Novell, and the
rest of the community.
