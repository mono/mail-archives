The String.Split bug for which I posted a patch I would consider an 
&quot;important bug&quot;, since it's a fix for a core system function (it doesn't 
get any more &quot;core&quot; than System.String) that was implemented incorrectly.

As they say, it's better to not implement a function at all than to 
implement it incorrectly. I've been dealing with this for over a year, 
having to check to see if code is running under Mono, and adding extra 
code to work around &quot;Mono's buggy system library&quot;. How embarrassing.

I'm having trouble convincing you developers to look at the fix though. 
I submitted what I hope is the final version of the patch a week ago, 
and no one has said a word. Perhaps the problem is that no one is 
responsible for corlib?

This fixes, by the way, bug #322375 that I filed just over a year ago. 
Wow, a year ago. And even when I fixed it myself I still can't get the 
patch merged. :-(   *sniff*

Just a little disappointed,
-Tyler
