<PRE>Miguel de Icaza escribi&#243;:
&gt;&gt;<i> Is MS Silverlight also a native library like Moonlight? Doesn't it have 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a managed API to be consumed by managed programs in order to use it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> outside of a browser?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is a COM component, and Microsoft has stated that they do not plan on
</I>&gt;<i> supporting that API and reserve the right to break it as needed.
</I>
Ok! All is clear now. I confess that I couldn't have thought of using 
COM nowadays...

Then, if one wants to make a cross-platform gadget, the only way is 
depending on the browser component, right? Or creating a compatibility 
layer library which would call to COM in Windows and deal with Moonlight 
API library in Linux.. But that seems too complex for me. Would it be 
feasible to create it?

But now I am thinking of another solution: Silverlight is a subset of 
WPF right? Then, in order to make moonlight work, this small subset of 
libraries must be already developed on olive, right? Then, I suppose 
that if one creates a .NET application that uses WPF3.0 libraries 
without accessing non-Silverlight parts, this application should be 
crossplatform I guess?

If yes, which would be the best way to do this? If current mono WPF 
libraries just include Silverlight parts (and do not include 
non-Silverlight even as NIEs), best way would be to compile against 
them, even from VS.NET, right?

I am just wondering which is the better way to create a cross-platform 
Silverlight desktop application. Thanks for all comments.
