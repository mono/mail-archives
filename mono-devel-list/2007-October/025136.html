It is possible to implement Mono's secure remoting based on
NegotiateStream, but we'd need something like SAMBA to handle
the mutual authentication.

For impersonation support, we'd need to &quot;suid root&quot; the application,
which is a no-no at present. IMO, this would require a complete audit
of all participating managed and unmanaged libs.

That said, I think we should implement secure remoting on top of
AuthenticatedStream (SslStream). This is the only way to make
secure remoting really useful on Mono's main platform Unix.

For MS.NET interoperability we could provide custom channels for
MS.NET based on our channels.
