<PRE>Hey,

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; We had discussed this about a year ago and decided that we had different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; interests, since we were focused on using MS .NET on Windows, and the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Mono team wanted to (rightfully so) focus on Mono on Windows.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Are the binaries for .NET and Mono any different, other than the GAC
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; install directory?
</I>
No, they're identical.

&gt;<i> I build gtk# on windows with vs .net for the sole purpose of eventually
</I>&gt;<i> shipping gtk# for ms .net.
</I>
Ah, we're building gtk# under cygwin (but with MS .NET).

&gt;<i> I think it's ok to have separate installers, but we may want to
</I>&gt;<i> reconsider the overall picture if we move everything to .msi.
</I>&gt;<i> (Ie: maybe have an .msi installer for gtk+, or use someone elses, one
</I>&gt;<i> for core mono, another for gtk#, etc...)
</I>
Yeah, I am intrigued at the possibility of using MSI merge modules so
that we could have a Gtk+ MSI merge module, a Gtk# merge module, and one
for Mono, and those could be removed/included at will, but I remember
hearing (I think from Paco) that it wasn't possible because of issues
with GACing.  It's definitely something we can (and probably should)
look into.

&gt;<i> &gt; Do you think it would be possible to have a single installer that
</I>&gt;<i> could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; install the same assemblies into both GACs?
</I>
Yes, I think this is possible, however it would force you guys to ship
Mono in a separate installer.

While we're chatting, if anyone is interested in getting their hands on
the source for our installers, they're available on our SourceForge.net
page[1].

Cheers,

-Brad
