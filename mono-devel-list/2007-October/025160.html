Ok, I will keep that in mind when testing the gtk# 2.10 installers
again.

</I>
So that was intended... 
I agree that 2.4 is old but there are at least 2 reasons still to ship
it:
a) official gtk# does, why break compatibility with it?
b) the gtk# installer from Paco was long time gtk# 2.4 only, so anyone
who wanted to transition to gtk# 2.8 could not just replace the
installer but also needs to rebuild all assemblies.

</I>
Ok, thanks :)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But now I would reconsider testing the gtk# 2.10 installer :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I really wouldn't recommend it at this point due to the bug that we're
</I>&gt;<i> seeing.  However, it may just be our application doing something
</I>&gt;<i> naughty.
</I>
Will see how our applications work. I will give feedback when I tested
it.
