<PRE>Hi,

I am trying to access the logging profiler
(mono/profiler/mono-profiler-logging.c) from a plug-able library. My plan
is to compile a C library that will call mono_profiler_startup (const char
*desc) and execute_user_command (char *command) to create heap dumps at my
whim. I spent time reading through the mono source code and am having
difficulty deciding if it's possible (errors that may occur as a result,
will the profiler methods exist, ... pitfalls) and how I should approach
accessing these methods (functions, flags, ... I need to set before and
after using the methods).

If I am unable to access the methods or they are not available, my back up
plan is to compile the logging profiler as a library and include it with my
library if possible. I found that it relies on config.h which worries me,
but I haven't done much research on my backup plan.

I'm using an older version of mono with the Boehm with typed GC. (So,
&quot;MONO_PROFILE_GC_ROOTS&quot;  doesn't exist which would have been way simpler
since I already rolled my own, which I learned from the Moonlight source,
using &quot;profiler.h&quot;.)  Also, mono is embedded with no direct control
available to me, which is one of the reasons I'm working on an internal
profiler. My hope is to avoid duplicating a lot of the work already done in
mono-profile-logging.c and simply, relatively, hack into it.

Adam
