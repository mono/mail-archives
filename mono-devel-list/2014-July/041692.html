<PRE>Hello,

Well, first questions first, is what you is doing legal?

Anyway, in the worst case you can do real binary patching redirecting all calls.
I already did that on CLR and should even easier on Mono as it&#8217;s open source and you can know how code will be JITed. If you know the target system I think that this is the way to go. You won&#8217;t even need to deal with writing native code, maybe just a bit of assembly injection.

In my experiments I ported an ordinary x86 hook library in C to C# and patched the JITed code in runtime a method stub created with System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.GetFunctionPointerToDelegate.
I also saved the a pointer to a trampoline so I could call the former method with a delegate using System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.GetDelegateForFunctionPointer.

I have seen some code samples of this online for .NET but I can't seem to find anyone doing this for Mono.
