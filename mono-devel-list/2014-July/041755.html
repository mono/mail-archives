Hi Ned,

Thanks. That's useful background. My understanding from this list is
that 3.6.x will be released some time quite soon? My hope is that
there'll be a Windows build of that available for download too, although
I don't yet understand who owns and drives that process.

(Somewhat off topic but I am starting to look at vNext which apparently
needs 3.4.1+ so a canonical Windows binary, and indeed Linux binary
would be useful for a number of reasons).

In the meantime I did build up some Windows binaries for 3.4.0, which
you might find it interesting to test with Mono.Data.Sqlite, assuming
you don't already have your own build.

<A HREF="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/769292/How-to-build-Mono-on-Windows">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/769292/How-to-build-Mono-on-Windows</A>

...

I'm not sure of my opinion on using System.Data.Sqlite vs
Mono.Data.Sqlite Ned.

I guess I'd start by asking - if we have System.Data.Sqlite, and it
works on Mono, then why do we need Mono.Data.Sqlite?

Wouldn't it be better to concentrate on a supporting a single build of
System.Data.Sqlite that is platform agnostic, and/or perhaps build that
into Mono if there's interest?

Cheers,

Alex
