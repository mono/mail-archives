<PRE>Hello,

   [ I have a tendency of always replying to the same messages that
     Jonathan has already replied, and his answers are always better
     than mine, but today I have something to add ] 

Like Jonathan said, given the criteria you have, the only possible
scenario is to intercept calls to methods in a &quot;MarshalByRef&quot; hierarchy
which specifically allows for this, but this is not a general purpose
mechanism.

It is possible to modify Mono to add a generic hooking feature, and I
encourage people to use Mono to testbed these sort of ideas, because it
is not really hard to do, but it would be a Mono-only feature.


&gt;<i> &lt;snip/&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is there any way in Mono, and hopefully a standard way that will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; also work on MS .NET, to &quot;hook&quot; system functions/classes?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To be more specific, I want to replace the File and Directory
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Open/Close/Read/Write classes and methods with my own ones that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; augment the behaviour of the standard routines, and are transparently
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; available to all programs, old and new, that previously used the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; standard implementations.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;snip/&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are only two basic mechanisms to change the behavior of an
</I>&gt;<i> existing function: virtual functions, and delegates (or something using
</I>&gt;<i> delegates, such as an event).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Both of these require prior planning on behalf of the original class
</I>&gt;<i> author, as functions are non-virtual by default, and delegates/events
</I>&gt;<i> would require that the programmer actually do something to explicitly
</I>&gt;<i> support it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, even if the functions were virtual, you'd still need to
</I>&gt;<i> make sure that, somehow, the user was creating instances of your class,
</I>&gt;<i> not your base class.  There are design patterns to do this, but for
</I>&gt;<i> anything created directly by the user (Strings, arrays, files, pretty
</I>&gt;<i> much everything) there is no way to substitute your class for the
</I>&gt;<i> original class.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why is this the case?  There are likely several reasons, but two that I
</I>&gt;<i> can think of are performance and security.  By ensuring that people can
</I>&gt;<i> only override functions in explicit ways, the runtime can better
</I>&gt;<i> optimize those patterns, helping to improve performance.  And if anyone
</I>&gt;<i> could replace any function, you'd have security holes introduced in no
</I>&gt;<i> time.
</I>
