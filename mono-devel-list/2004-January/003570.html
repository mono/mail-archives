<PRE>.NET provides the System.Xml.XmlReader API instead of a the SAX API
(which has also been implemented by libxml2).  It avoids the memory
overhead of a DOM, and the callback issues with SAX.  Conceptually, it
resembles a compiler lexer -- you Read() to get the next &quot;token&quot; (XML
element), which you can then inspect using the XmlReader properties.

XmlReader is intended for processing multi-gigabyte files.  I'm not sure
if it's actually successful in doing so, but it *should* be able to do
so, without requiring gigabytes of memory (like a DOM would require).

It would be interesting to know if XmlReader can be used for your
particular high performance applications.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks. ;-) Did it with Delphi. Hope it isn't much more difficult with C#.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Regarding Problem 1 (interning strings), is there any particular reason
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you want the strings interned?  The only time it's useful is if you want
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to use pointer comparison instead of string comparison for strings,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which would require that users do this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ((object) String1) == ((object) String2)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I suspect most people will stick with the typical:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; String1 == String2
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which calls Object.Equals, so there's no reason to intern the string
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (unless you want to require your users use the first code).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The reason is that in a typical case the XML parser will report
</I>&gt;<i> the same name over and over again. Rather than allocating the
</I>&gt;<i> same string over and over I would prefer to look it up
</I>&gt;<i> in the pool. I did the same with Delphi and it seems to be
</I>&gt;<i> beneficial, resource and performance wise. Memory allocation
</I>&gt;<i> is expensive.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Assuming you do want to intern the string, you could create a hashtable,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; manually hash the &quot;const XML_Char *name&quot;, and use this hash value to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lookup the interned string.  This would likely require writing your own
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hash function (so it can operate on a &quot;const XML_Char*&quot;), and you'd have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to consider hash table conflicts, but this could be made to work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes - I have done this already with another wrapper (see above) - I was just
</I>&gt;<i> hoping I cold use the built-in string pool. Since this seems
</I>&gt;<i> rather impossible from what I see I will have to port the string
</I>&gt;<i> hash table to C#. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Personally, I wouldn't worry about it until you've done the performance
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; profiling (mono --profile is your friend!) and determined that string
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interning would actually be a benefit.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, the question is: what works somewhere else may not work in C#.
</I>&gt;<i> However, it seems avoiding memory allocations is a good optimization
</I>&gt;<i> technique regardless of language (at least for the popular ones).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the C/C++ world, Expat is used for high performance applications,
</I>&gt;<i> like parsing XML files in the giga-byte range. Maybe in the C# world
</I>&gt;<i> there is no audience for that. You are right, and if I had to write
</I>&gt;<i> all the wrapper code from scratch I would delay this to the end.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I think I can port most of it from Delphi, in the style
</I>&gt;<i> of a &quot;re-write in spirit&quot;, not a straight copy. Will be a good
</I>&gt;<i> C# exercise.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Regarding Problem 2, I can't think of any good way to avoid the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; marshaling/copying overhead.  Managed and unmanaged memory must be kept
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; separate (to permit the use of non-conservative garbage collectors). 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You could employ C# &quot;unsafe&quot; code in the callback methods, but this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would prevent non-C# languages (VB, JavaScript, etc.) from being used as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; callbacks...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, that is what I want to avoid.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One theoretical possibility is this: Expat allows you to pass it a set
</I>&gt;<i> of memory handlers (same signatures as the C runtime functions
</I>&gt;<i> malloc, realloc and free).
</I>&gt;<i> I could use this to force Expat to use &quot;managed&quot; memory which exists
</I>&gt;<i> as some byte array on the C# side. That way I could go from the
</I>&gt;<i> pointer passed in the call-back to the index in the array, without
</I>&gt;<i> having to copy. However, writing a memory allocator looks like
</I>&gt;<i> overkill and would probably cost more than it benefits.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is really the problem behind Problem 1 -- memory must be kept
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; separate, and coming up with efficient ways to bridge the barrier is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; difficult, hence the marshaling overhead...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - Jon

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your insights,
