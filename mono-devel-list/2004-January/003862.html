<PRE>The class libraries are in the &quot;mcs&quot; CVS repository, inside the &quot;class&quot;
directory.  This directory is organized as:

	[assembly-name]/[namespace-name]/[class-name]

The [assembly-name] directory is the name of an assembly: (1) without
the .dll extension; (2) possibly with a different casing (the System.XML
directory generates System.Xml.dll); and (3) possibly with a (slightly)
different name (the corlib directory now creates mscorlib.dll).

The [assembly-name] directory also contains a Makefile which will
generate the assembly, and *only* that assembly.  The Makefile in the
&quot;class&quot; directory will create *all* assemblies.

The [namespace-name] directory is a &quot;flat&quot; list of directories.  This
isn't Java, where the org.foo.bar package requires the directory tree
org/foo/bar; instead, mcs would have a org.foo.bar directory.  For
example, class/corlib has the directories System, System.Collections,
System.IO, and System.Text.  These are all sibling directories.

Finally, [class-name] is a file that implements the [class-name] class. 
There is no requirement that public classes actually be in a file of the
same name, but it is our convention.  (It's not always followed, so grep
is your friend.)

With that overview, the answer to your questions are simple:

You need to edit the file &lt;cvs
repository=&quot;mcs&quot;/&gt;/class/System/System.ComponentModel/LicenseManager.cs.

Once you're done editing that file, run &quot;make&quot; from within the
class/System directory.  This will place System.dll into the class/lib
directory.  Once built, you can either manually copy System.dll into
your install location, or run &quot;make install&quot; from the top-level
directory.

I have no idea if using some other library is better than using
LicenseManager.  However, I'm sure that other groups will need
LicenseManager implemented at some point, so if you implement it for
your code, you will likely be helping other groups out.
