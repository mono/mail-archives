For the issue of merely being *able* to compile -- not assuming 'gcc',
needing certain flags -- it shouldn't be hard to get the makefiles up to
speed. All those assumptions are coded in the build/ subdirectory, and a
fix there will work globally.

As for being able to mount one MCS source tree on several drives, as you
mentioned ... I don't think that will be fixable in the current system.
Seems to me like moving the libraries into the mono CVS module would
make more sense. (Maybe there are dependency ordering issues, but on
Unix they already exist.)
