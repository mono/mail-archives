<PRE>I am having a problem with a chunk of code dealing with simple
references and I currently suspect the problem is with mcs in cvs for
the past few weeks, but I am unsure of what I am seeing. Could someone
check my results?

The problem originally had to do with using the
Threading.InterlockedIncrement calls, but I have reduced it to the
attached simple program. What I have seen is that the attached test
program succeeds when compiled with csc, or any msc that has been built
from sources from .29 through sometime in late Dec. If it is compiled by
an mcs from late Dec to current CVS, it fails (x is never incremented).
A bad exe will fail on the mono or MS runtime. I have tried building mcs
on machines running Redhat 9 with XD2, and SUSE 9.

I have been hesitant to submit a bug report because this seems so basic,
perhaps I am missing something obvious. Any help is appreciated.
