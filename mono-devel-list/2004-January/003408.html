This was already discussed a few months ago. At the time I described how
to fix the issue, but no enteprising mono developer showed up, so I
committed my ten line patch today.
Remoting should see a sensible speedup, too, since it uses GetType in
places.

</I>
The current impl is probably as fast as it can be (with about 30 bytes
of memory overhead per vtable: we'll see later if it makes sense to
have a slightly slower implementation and to delay allocate the memory).

The Binder code needs some work to better match the MS implementation: I
suggest not trying to optimize it until we actually cover all the
corner cases and your suggestions can only be implemented in some
special cases, anyway.
