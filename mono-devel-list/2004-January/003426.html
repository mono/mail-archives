With monodis, no, sadly. If someone who knows C well would like to hack
this in (/me looks at Jackson, Lupus, Gonzalo, Miguel, Zoltan and
others) it would be a great hack :).

It would also be great if the runtime guys could explain how to get the
Assembly code from one method, and one method only.

</I>
The JIT turns some methods into inline code.
Examples include:
      * Math.{Sin, Cos, Tan}
      * String.Length
      * now, Object.GetType ().


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Lists like this are pretty silly, I do not keep one -- either in my head
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or on paper. When I look at how to make mcs faster, I don't say:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; `Man, today, why dont i replace all ==&quot;&quot; calls with .Length == 0'
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rather I say:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; `Method Foo () runs REALLY slow, whats up with that'
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are you sure you don't keep one in your head, but a simpler one that

</I>&gt;<i> objects when I could be doing it so much better&quot;? Just knowing what

</I>&gt;<i> will help people like me avoid doing really stupid things. 
</I>

Object allocation is not the only path to slow code.

Btw, Miguel and myself have started writing some performance guidelines.
The text is a bit rough right now. I would appreciate suggestions. I
would love if people would give us a list of `top 10 things i learned
about performance that are not obvious'.
