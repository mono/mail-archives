	I completely agree with this. I know for a fact that Miguel, Ben and
even Zoltan committed many different optimizations to MCS to make it as
fast as it is today. 


	I think we should write up a document from inputs from these three (and
others) so that others don't have to rediscover them :-)


	Ravi.
