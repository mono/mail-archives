<PRE>Hi,
 
First of all, I just wanted to say that this is the greatest project to
ever come to Linux, IMO. I've been watching this project since it was
first established. Anyhow, I love .net technology. I'm currently
attending a private college called TriOS College studying the
&quot;Enterprise Application Developer&quot; program, currently learning VB.net
and C#, but later pursuing the other .net technologies. Anyhow, I want
to gain a better understanding of the framework and the languages
themselves, and therefore thought it would be really great if I could
help the Mono project. My programming skills are mostly intermediate at
this point, but I'm very eager to learn and willing to do so. So, is
there anything small that I contribute to the project? Even if it's just
adding those odd missing methods that have been put off because they're
so easy to implement or boring to code, I'll take them! I'd love to see
VB.net come to Linux, so if there's anything I can do to help there that
would be great. I've never really coded anything outside of school, so
I'll have to ask for your patience at first, but I definitely want to
contribute to this wonderful project somehow. Thanks.
 
 
Regards,
Mike.
