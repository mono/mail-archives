I didn't use /tmp, because files there can be blown away at any time and
mono processes might well be long-lived.  I'm not sure it's a good idea
to have the socket there either.

The abstract namespace is just a way of using Unix domain sockets on
linux without the need for a filesystem entry.

BTW, your machine-name filename patch looks fine.
