</I>
This warning means exactly what it says: that type overrides the &quot;Equals&quot;
method, but it allows the base type to implement &quot;GetHashCode&quot;. You can
squish this warning by overriding GetHashCode() from class TypeExpr as
well. Something like the following would not affect behaviour at all, but
would be a (very minor) performance hit if TypeExpr's GetHashCode method is
ever called (assuming the JIT doesn't optimize the entire method body into
a simple vtable change):

public abstract class TypeExpr : Expression {
  ...
  public override int GetHashCode() {
    return base.GetHashCode();
  }
  ...
}

&gt;<i>cfold.cs(271,27): warning CS0675: Bitwise-or operator used on a
</I>&gt;<i>sign-extended operand; consider casting to a smaller
</I>&gt;<i>        unsigned type first
</I>
I can't locate the code which this refers to (in that source file, current
anoncvs, I only see bitwise-ands), but the meaning of this warning is that
one of the operands to a bitwise-or operation is signed and is shorter than
the width of the bit field. This is important in the case where the bit
field is wider than that argument; if that shorter argument's high bit is
set, then that argument will be sign-extended, which will set all the bits
in the bit field higher than that. For example, say you have a 32-bit bit
field, and through some bad planning, you want to set the 15th bit using a
signed short variable:

  uint bitfield = 0;
  short bit15 = unchecked((short)0x8000);

  bitfield |= bit15;

After this, bitfield's value is in fact not 0x00008000 but 0xFFFF8000. As
the warning indicates, it can be squelched by casting the shorter argument
to the corresponding unsigned type:

  bitfield |= (ushort)bit15;

This will set bitfield to the expected value of 0x00008000.

Good luck :-)

Jonathan
