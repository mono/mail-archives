Is there an easy way to get the IL for a single method out of an
assembly, or even out of mcs? I am also a little confused how to see
what the JITer does with a method. Mono has --compile METHOD, but I
spent some time working out how to specify the name of a method for it,
and does it output anything unless you use -v -v? Is there a better way
than doing this. I think that these might be the sort of things that
should go in this document.

Could you explain this one in more detail please?

</I>
Are you sure you don't keep one in your head, but a simpler one that
says &quot;Why on earth am I doing it this way, creating a whole bunch of
objects when I could be doing it so much better&quot;? Just knowing what
creates a message bit of reflection and what is handled by the compiler
will help people like me avoid doing really stupid things.
