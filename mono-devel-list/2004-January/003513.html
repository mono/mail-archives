<PRE>
Right, I have been working on this for a while now, and I am nearly
there. However I think that other people should have a look and comment
on what they think of my code, and what I have done.

Our validation is now closer to that of MS .NET, and also closer to XML
Schema than it was before. 

I have tested it against the Xsd test suite, and the only failures that
didn't fail before appear to be on the comparisons of floating point
values right on the edges of that represented by Decimal, and MS fail
these too.

Also included is my patch to corlib/System/DateTime.cs, to fix bug
52274, which is needed to compare some of the date based types.

TODO:

  * base64Binary and hexBinary types should have the length of their
  _decoded_ data compared to the lenth facets

  * length facets should be ignored for QName and NOTATION type objects
  (by the XML Schema errata)

  * Test cases. I haven't written any yet. I could do with an example of
  how to write test cases for internal classes, or another way of
  testing some of this code.
