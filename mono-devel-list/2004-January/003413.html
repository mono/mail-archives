</I>Paolo, your patch is absolutely wonderful. I cannot measure the
performance of the GetType operation with the loop count i used before,
it is under .2 seconds. That is a 100x improvement.

Great work.

</I>
Well, my suggestion actually does not involve touching the Binder code.

What I am suggesting is that we check if the types match *exactly*
inside the runtime, and then we can call the binder *ONLY IF* it is not
an exact match.

As I said before, it seems MS does this. In fact, *not* doing it is
externally visable.

I realize it is a special case, but this special case happens to be the
most common case :).
