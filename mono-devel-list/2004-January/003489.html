<PRE>I have discovered there is now more native code in the mcs directory
structure - in particular in Mono.Posix. This causes me problems because I
use different platforms and different compilers (not gcc) and the make files
aren't configurable enough to cope (at least at the moment). Given that mono
&amp; configure is already setup to cope with all this platform dependency I am
wondering why this code is in mcs and not mono? Should it be moved? And
indeed should some of the Mono.Posix stuff really be InternalCall? Or does
this mean the makefiles need fixing to cope? (Note I have not looked at the
mbuild stuff recently discussed but I'm currently concerned about building
right now).

When it was just cairo related stuff this didn't bother me that much but now
it seems more important.

There is the secondary issue that you can't do a build of mcs on one
platform and copy the DLLs for other Unix's as now the result of a make
isn't platform independent (or more precisely more Unix independent). And
for me I'd need to make sure make can handle platform specific output
directories too (I have one source structure NFS mounted on multiple
platforms).

Anyway I'd like to hear what the approach to this should be - I can try and
work on the makefiles or perhaps moving the code depending on what is the
way to go.

Bernie
