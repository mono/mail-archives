Only in your limited corner/view of the world. There is a surprisingly
small number of people that should do that: people working from cvs.
People installing from snapshots or tarballs just need to do make
install and people using distribution packages don't need to do anything
of the sorts. Note that the last two sets of people are easily 3 orders
of magnitude bigger than the people that should follow your suggestion.

&gt;<i> So, when we are at stage 2, the *new* mono should return a `0' when

</I>
As long as the check is not done by default it's fine, because by
default it's wrong and if you'd spend one minute thinking about it you'd
realize it.

&gt;<i> Also, we could allow someone to run:
</I>&gt;<i> make install SANITY_CHECKS=false
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> to override the safeguard in non-standard cases.
</I>
Yes, too bad your concept of standard is the wrong one.

&gt;<i> The reason why I support having it in the build is that often people
</I>&gt;<i> will install the runtime first before building corlib. This puts them in
</I>&gt;<i> a really hard position, as they are not able to get out of it without
</I>&gt;<i> the assistance of a monocharge.
</I>
People that use packages, tarballs and snapshots don't need the check.
People that use cvs can screwup the installation in a million ways: they
are supposed to always keep a working mono install separate from the cvs
install, that way there is no issue. If you want to add the check to
make fullbuild, it's ok, as long as you and other people realize that
make fullbuild is just a hack and it may not work. The right thing to do
is to explain people they should not overwrite their working mono
install.
If you need to cut the branch of a tree, you better not sit on that
branch. You're telling people: use my magic chainsaw and even if you cut
the branch you're sitting on, you won't fall. And they go only to
realize the magic chainsaw doesn't work when it's too late.
Just sit on one branch (keep a working mono install in a different
prefix) when you need to cut another (make install a new mono version).
