Well...  You be cute about it. :-)

For every change (added method, field) to a class, you actually create a
new derived object.  You determine the actual object to instantiate by
keeping the most-derived class name hanging around a well-known
location.

	class RuntimeInfo {
		public static string ActualClassName = &quot;Something_2&quot;
	}

	// at runtime...
	class Something_0 { ... }
	class Something_1 : Something_0 {...}
	class Something_2 : Something_1 {...}

Problem: it doesn't handle updating existing class instances.  Thus,
this may be unsuitable for some situations.

&gt;<i> In CIL you can call a virtual function. This, as far as I understand, is the

</I>&gt;<i> methodName string and a list of parameters? This would be essential for
</I>&gt;<i> dynamically typed languages wouldn't it.
</I>
Why add a new CIL instruction, when you can just do it yourself?

	interface IDynamicLanguage {
		public object Invoke (string message, object[] args);
	}

Just have all your internal classes implement IDynamicLanguage, and you
get the same functionality as &quot;send_msg&quot;.  There's no particular reason
why this has to be in CIL, as opposed to doing it yourself (above).

&gt;<i> Disclaimer: I don't really know much about this I'm just wondering what kind
</I>&gt;<i> of platform support that is necessary if you want dynamically typed
</I>&gt;<i> languages to execute more or less directly on the CLR, meaning that classes

</I>
This is an open research question. :-)

The ways outlined above would work, but they're not necessarily the
*best* way to do it.  I'm not sure what the best way is, and I'm not
sure anyone else knows either, for that matter.

Thus, research and experimentation are required. :-)
