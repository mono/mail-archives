<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> &gt;Also I wouldn't like to endorse bad development habits, so unless there is a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;huge demand for that kind of  let-me-fire-a-bullet-at-my-own-foot 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;compatibility I prefer to simply document it as something that mbas is more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;strict than vbc.
</I>
I feel that the default for the Mono VB.NET compiler should be to be
compatible with the Microsoft compiler.  If we want to have different
semantics, those should be set with some kind of extra flag, say /strict
or something like that.

&gt;<i> VB.NET syntax, to put it mildly, is an awful mess. We have an even bigger
</I>&gt;<i> problem: since mBas is a direct derivative of mcs, we must make some compromises
</I>&gt;<i> due to the differences between the grammars (declarations in mcs' grammar
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;flow&quot; in a different way and order). There are already many horrid hacks
</I>&gt;<i> in mb-parser.jay to overcome the most blatant problems, but still there
</I>&gt;<i> is a lot to be done. BTW: ccc (ColorCubeCodeBase Mud Server) can currently
</I>&gt;<i> be parsed with only minor modifications. There are some problems with type
</I>&gt;<i> resolution which prevent it from compiling (static constructors, etc.) but
</I>&gt;<i> I hope these can be solved in a few weeks.
</I>
Can you tell us more about the problems you are facing with the parser? 
Maybe I can provide some suggestions about what we can do?

Miguel
