<PRE>I also would always just use DllImport in the sample code, instead of
the full type name, it's enough to mention &quot;using
System.Runtime.InteropServices;&quot; somewhere.

&gt;<i>    &lt;monodoc:example id=&quot;simple-dllimport&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>       [System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImport (&quot;libc.so&quot;)]
</I>&gt;<i>       private static extern int getpid ();
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;/monodoc:example&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;p&gt;The above C# function declaration would invoke the POSIX
</I>&gt;<i>    getpid(2) system call on platforms that have the libc.so library (other
</I>&gt;<i>    platforms would generate a 
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;a href=&quot;T:System.MissingMethodException&quot;&gt;MissingMethodException&lt;/a&gt;).  
</I>&gt;<i>    Simple.  Straightforward.  What could be easier?&lt;/p&gt;
</I>
You may also want to note the issue that library names are
platform-specific and the dllmap mechanism provided by mono in the
config file to solve the issue.

&gt;<i>    &lt;p&gt;How does code interop work?  Given a managed call site (the function
</I>&gt;<i>    call), and an unmanaged callee site (the function that's being called), each
</I>&gt;<i>    parameter in the call site is &quot;marshaled&quot; (converted) into an unmanaged
</I>&gt;<i>    equivalent.  The marshaled data is in turn placed on the runtime stack
</I>&gt;<i>    (along with other data), and the unmanaged function is invoked.&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;p&gt;The complexity is due to the marshaling.  For simple types, such as 
</I>&gt;<i>    integers and floating-point numbers, marshaling is a bitwise-copy
</I>&gt;<i>    (&quot;blitting&quot;), just as would be the case for unmanaged code.  String types
</I>
In some cases, no marshaling and no copy of data happens, for example
when the data is blittable most of the time it's enough to pass a
pointer to the managed representation.

&gt;<i>    &lt;p&gt;What's the memory management policy for using &quot;string&quot; as a return
</I>&gt;<i>    value?  Does the runtime expect to free it?&lt;/p&gt;
</I>
Yes, though I don't remember if we insert the free() yet: note we will
use free by default on unix-like platforms and the MS-specified free
routine on windows.

&gt;<i>    &lt;p&gt;Conceptually, classes and structures are marshalled to native code
</I>&gt;<i>    by:&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;ol&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>       &lt;li&gt;The runtime allocates a chunk of unmanaged memory.&lt;/li&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>       &lt;li&gt;The managed class data is copied into the unmanaged memory.&lt;/li&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>       &lt;li&gt;The unmanaged function is invoked, passing it the unmanaged memory
</I>&gt;<i>          information instead of the managed memory information.  This must be
</I>&gt;<i>          done so that if a GC occurs, the unmanaged function doesn't need to
</I>&gt;<i>          worry about it.  (And yes, you need to worry about GCs, as the
</I>&gt;<i>          unmanaged function could call back into the runtime, generating a
</I>&gt;<i>          GC.)&lt;/li&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>       &lt;li&gt;The unmanaged memory is copied into managed memory.&lt;/li&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;/ol&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;p&gt;The principal difference between class and structure marshaling is which
</I>&gt;<i>    of these conceptual steps actually occurs. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;h4&gt;Class Marshaling&lt;/h4&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;p&gt;Remember that classes are heap-allocated and garbage-collected in the
</I>&gt;<i>    CLI.  As such, you cannot pass classes by value to unmanaged functions,
</I>&gt;<i>    only by reference:&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;monodoc:example id=&quot;class-marshal-example&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>       struct UnmanagedStruct {
</I>&gt;<i>          int a, b, c;
</I>&gt;<i>       };
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>       void WRONG (struct UnamangedStruct pass_by_value)
</I>&gt;<i>       {
</I>&gt;<i>       }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>       void RIGHT (struct UnmanagedStruct *pass_by_reference)
</I>&gt;<i>       {
</I>&gt;<i>       }
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;/monodoc:example&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;p&gt;This means that you cannot use classes to invoke unmanaged functions
</I>&gt;<i>    that expect a stack-allocated variable (such as the WRONG function,
</I>
Use the pass-by-value term, stack allocation is orthogonal.

&gt;<i>    &lt;h4&gt;Structure Marshaling&lt;/h4&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;p&gt;There are two primary differences between classes and structures.
</I>&gt;<i>    First, structures do not need to be allocated on the heap; they can be
</I>&gt;<i>    stack allocated.  Secondly, they use Sequential LayoutKind by default, so
</I>&gt;<i>    structure declarations do not need any additional attributes to use them
</I>&gt;<i>    with unmanaged code (assuming that the default sequential layout rules are
</I>&gt;<i>    correct for the unmanaged structure).&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;p&gt;These differences permit structures to be passed by-value to unmanaged
</I>&gt;<i>    functions, unlike classes.  Additionally, since structures are typically
</I>&gt;<i>    located on the stack (unless they're boxed or part of a class instance), if
</I>&gt;<i>    you pass a structure to an unmanaged function by-reference, the structure
</I>&gt;<i>    will be passed directly to the unmanaged function, without an intermediate
</I>&gt;<i>    unmanaged memory copy.  This means that you may not need to specify the Out
</I>
The unmanaged copy may not happen for classes, too: the object is simply
pinned in memory and a pointer to the start of the data is passed (if
the type is blittable and no marshaling is needed).
The main difference is that classes can't be passed by value; structs
can be passed by value unless ref or out is used. As a return type,
if you use a class, the unmanaged function is considered to return a
pointer to the unmanaged representation of the object. If you use a
struct, the data is supposed to be returned by value. It should be noted
that you can't return a struct by reference, while you can pass a struct
by reference. If you need to return a struct by reference you can make
the P/Invoke function return a IntPtr and use Marshal.PtrToStructure ().

&gt;<i>    &lt;h3&gt;Marshaling Class and Structure Members&lt;/h3&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;p&gt;Aside from the major differences between classes and structures outlined
</I>&gt;<i>    above, the members of classes and structures are marshaled identically.&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;p&gt;The general rule of advice is this: never pass classes or structures
</I>&gt;<i>    containing members of reference type (classes) to unmanaged code.
</I>&gt;<i>    This is because unmanaged code can't do anything safely with the unmanaged 
</I>&gt;<i>    reference (pointer), and the CLI runtime doesn't do a &quot;deep marshal&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>    (marshal members of marshaled classes, and their members, ad
</I>&gt;<i>    infinitum).&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;p&gt;The immediate net effect of this is that you can't have string and array
</I>&gt;<i>    members of marshaled classes.&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;p&gt;It's not quite as bad as this makes out.  You can't pass strings and
</I>&gt;<i>    arrays BY DEFAULT.  If you help the runtime marshaler by addorning the
</I>
I'm not sure this is right: you can use strings and arrays in types that
will be marshaled and by default they will be converted to pointers to
the data.

	string -&gt; char* (or gunichar2*, depending on the charset property)
	int[]  -&gt; gint32*
	etc.

&gt;<i>    &lt;monodoc:example id=&quot;&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>       typedef struct _neo_err
</I>&gt;<i>       {
</I>&gt;<i>         int error;
</I>&gt;<i>         int err_stack;
</I>&gt;<i>         int flags;
</I>&gt;<i>         char desc[256];
</I>&gt;<i>         const char *file;
</I>&gt;<i>         const char *func;
</I>&gt;<i>         int lineno;
</I>&gt;<i>         /* internal use only */
</I>&gt;<i>         struct _neo_err *next;
</I>&gt;<i>       } NEOERR;
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;/monodoc:example&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;p&gt;My philosophy of using unsafe struct pointers, and just accessing the
</I>&gt;<i>    struct out in unmanaged memory is great, and it's exactly what I want
</I>&gt;<i>    to do. However, handling &quot;char dest[256]&quot; is not straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;p&gt;In C# arrays are reference types. Using one makes the struct a managed
</I>&gt;<i>    type, and I can't put the array size in. The following is conceptually
</I>&gt;<i>    what I want to do, however, it's obviously invalid:&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;monodoc:example id=&quot;&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>       [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)]
</I>&gt;<i>       unsafe struct NEOERR {
</I>&gt;<i>         public int error;
</I>&gt;<i>         public int err_stack;
</I>&gt;<i>         public int flags;
</I>&gt;<i>         public byte[256] desc;  // this is invalid, can't contain size
</I>
	[MarshalAs (UnmanagedType.ByValArray, SizeConst=256)]
	public byte[] desc;
should work.

	[MarshalAs (UnmanagedType.ByValTStr, SizeConst=256)]
	public string desc;
may work as well.

&gt;<i>    &lt;p&gt;UGH! First, this is obviously annoying. Second, the only way I can
</I>&gt;<i>    figure to get access to &quot;char dest[256]&quot; is to use &quot;char* dest =
</I>&gt;<i>    &amp;amp;nerr-&amp;gt;dest_first_char;&quot; and then just use dest as a pointer to the
</I>&gt;<i>    string. I've dug through the documentation, and I can't find any
</I>&gt;<i>    better solution.&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;p&gt;Obviously it would be ideal if there were a way to represent a
</I>&gt;<i>    value-type array. I wonder how Managed C++ handles &quot;char foo[256];&quot; in
</I>&gt;<i>    a struct.&lt;/p&gt;
</I>
Using ByValArray is probably the best option here.
Thanks for writing this document: it looks like a good start.
