<PRE>Hi,

I am attempting to get the ModMono apache module installed but am having
trouble. At the moment page requests such as index.aspx are retuning a
blank page and the apache logs are indicating a HTTP 200 response...
i.e. success. there is no easily visible error in the log files (even
with apache set to the debug log level). However I'm not discounting the
fact that it's possibly something dumb I've done in the configuration of
Apache.

I first went with the XSP hosting option to verify a working setup, and
successfully had that up and running executing ASPX source, but try as I
might I havn't figured out how to get ModMono working.

I downloaded the mod_mono 0.3.7 RPMs for Red Hat 8.0 from
www.apacheworld.org/modmono which could be part of the problem, as they
state they work with mono 0.24 while I'm using 0.26... but they
installed fine without any dependency problems

Info which might be of use...

[<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">root at shazam</A> chris]# rpm -q mono mono-devel mod_mono httpd httpd-devel

-rw-------    1 apache   apache          8 Sep  3 02:14
shared_scratch-1-0

/var/www/html/mono is where I've copied the test directory from a CVS
checkout of the XSP project, and is where my httpd.conf setup is
pointing ModMono to...

I've verified that my httpd.conf is loading /etc/httpd/conf.d/mono.conf,
so all appears to be ok.

The rest of the webserver hosted documents (static HTML and PHP mainly)
is working fine.

I have gone through the FAQ at www.apacheworld.org and tried the various
suggestions with respect to commenting out parts of various config
files.

What should I attempt to do next with respect to attempting to resolve
this? Would it be easier if I attempted to build ModMono from source?
I'm willing to do that, I just though I'd try the RPMs first, as the
last time I attempted to build the entire mono framework from scratch I
ran into some &quot;nasty&quot; configuration problems.

I have been playing around with mono for about a three months or so now
on non ASP.NET related endeavours, and in fact it is my only &quot;contact&quot;
with the .NET environment outside of work.

The reason why I am attempting to get ModMono up and running at home
(apart from liking the ASP.NET development model), is to quietly start
seeing how difficult it would be to &quot;port&quot; (if that's the right word for
it) some of our commercial web applications into a situation where they
support more hosting options than IIS under Windows.

Thanks,
Christopher Fairbairn
