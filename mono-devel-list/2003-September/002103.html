Kind of - if you program in a traditional style, you will not notice whether
tail-call optimization is turned on or not, except that some recursive functions
will run in finite stack space instead of infinite. You may choose to see this as
either a bug or a feature :-) (The Lisp community is divided on this issue, where
the Scheme community pretty definitely sees it as a feature.)

However, if the user/developer can *rely* on the presence of tail-call optimisation,
whole new styles of programming are opened up. In particular, the use of &quot;continuation
passing style&quot; (google knows!) becomes possible, which is an incredibly powerful
tool. Once you grok continuations you may never look back...

More directly to the list: the better Mono supports proper tail-calls, the better
it supports Scheme, the better my compiler will work, and the happier I will be :-)
