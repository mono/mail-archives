<PRE>This is just a guess, but I don't think this is easily solvable.

Unix platforms use sbrk(2) to allocate additional memory from the
Operating System.  I don't know of any mechanism to *release* the
allocated memory back to the OS.

Once memory is allocated for a process, there is no way (that I know of)
to release it.

Thus, even after a garbage collection, the GC heap may be fully
collected, even empty (i.e. containing no user-allocated objects), but
without a means for the OS to reclaim space, the actual memory used
*cannot* decrease.

Please correct me if I'm wrong.
