<PRE>Thank you for the feedback.

Now for some clarifications...

How can you do that?  The only time I can see this happening is when
you're passing a pointer to a structure (using ref or out).

This doesn't appear to happen with passing classes (which is why the
[Out] attribute is needed to see changes made to the instance by the
unmanaged function), and structures without &quot;ref&quot; or &quot;out&quot; should be
completely copied, or else the unmanaged function won't be getting what
it expects on the stack.

&gt;<i> &gt;    &lt;p&gt;What's the memory management policy for using &quot;string&quot; as a return

</I>
Would it be more .NET-compatible if I said that unmanaged memory were
freed from within the runtime &quot;as if&quot; via
System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.FreeCoTaskMem (IntPtr)?

Now, on Unix this could call the platform-native free(3), but under
Win32 this could call CoTaskMemFree().

Does it make sense to document it this way, or should I just not mention
Marshal.AllocCoTaskMem/FreeCoTaskMem at all?

&lt;snip/&gt;

&gt;<i> &gt;    &lt;h3&gt;Marshaling Class and Structure Members&lt;/h3&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    &lt;p&gt;Aside from the major differences between classes and structures outlined
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    above, the members of classes and structures are marshaled identically.&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    &lt;p&gt;The general rule of advice is this: never pass classes or structures
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    containing members of reference type (classes) to unmanaged code.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    This is because unmanaged code can't do anything safely with the unmanaged 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    reference (pointer), and the CLI runtime doesn't do a &quot;deep marshal&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    (marshal members of marshaled classes, and their members, ad
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    infinitum).&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    &lt;p&gt;The immediate net effect of this is that you can't have string and array
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    members of marshaled classes.&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    &lt;p&gt;It's not quite as bad as this makes out.  You can't pass strings and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    arrays BY DEFAULT.  If you help the runtime marshaler by addorning the
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure this is right: you can use strings and arrays in types that
</I>&gt;<i> will be marshaled and by default they will be converted to pointers to
</I>&gt;<i> the data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	string -&gt; char* (or gunichar2*, depending on the charset property)
</I>&gt;<i> 	int[]  -&gt; gint32*
</I>&gt;<i> 	etc.
</I>
That was my argument for &quot;BY DEFAULT.&quot;  By default, there is no
StructLayout attribute, and hence there is no CharSet specified.

If CharSet isn't set, is there a default marshal format for strings and
arrays?  I didn't think there was.  (Platform-native would be a sensible
default, but since platform-native is UCS-2 on NT-based platforms and
Ansi on Win9x-based platforms, this wouldn't be particularly developer
friendly, so requiring that the CharSet be specified would be a good
idea regardless.)

&lt;snip/&gt;

&gt;<i> &gt;    &lt;monodoc:example id=&quot;&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       unsafe struct NEOERR {
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         public int error;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         public int err_stack;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         public int flags;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         public byte[256] desc;  // this is invalid, can't contain size
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	[MarshalAs (UnmanagedType.ByValArray, SizeConst=256)]
</I>&gt;<i> 	public byte[] desc;
</I>&gt;<i> should work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	[MarshalAs (UnmanagedType.ByValTStr, SizeConst=256)]
</I>&gt;<i> 	public string desc;
</I>&gt;<i> may work as well.
</I>
I'll need to test those.

&gt;<i> Thanks for writing this document: it looks like a good start.

Thanks,
