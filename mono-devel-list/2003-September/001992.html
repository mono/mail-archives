Yes, but you can review any unmanaged API and you'll see that that
is the case most of the time, structs are almost always passed by
reference, not by value in C code.

</I>&gt;<i> Now, on Unix this could call the platform-native free(3), but under

Yes, please include this info.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;    &lt;p&gt;The immediate net effect of this is that you can't have string and array

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;    &lt;p&gt;It's not quite as bad as this makes out.  You can't pass strings and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;    arrays BY DEFAULT.  If you help the runtime marshaler by addorning the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	int[]  -&gt; gint32*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That was my argument for &quot;BY DEFAULT.&quot;  By default, there is no

</I>
There is always a default charset value, Charset.Auto, even with no
StructLayout attribute. So, by default, it works.

&gt;<i> If CharSet isn't set, is there a default marshal format for strings and
</I>&gt;<i> arrays?  I didn't think there was.  (Platform-native would be a sensible
</I>&gt;<i> default, but since platform-native is UCS-2 on NT-based platforms and
</I>&gt;<i> Ansi on Win9x-based platforms, this wouldn't be particularly developer

</I>&gt;<i> idea regardless.)
</I>
Yes, the P/Invoke specification (or lack thereof) is a mess. It was done
by people that didn't thought through the portability issues and this is
probably one of the reasons the MS CLR is not really supported on
9x-based platforms. Note: P/Invoke is intrinsically non-portable, the
main issue is that P/Invoke is poorly defined in a non-win32 system.
Think of Charset: they allow Ansi and Unicode (with Auto meaning one or
the other according to the platform), but the world uses also other
encodings. At the very least they should have added a Charset.Encoding
or something, with the actual encoding specified separately as a string,
for example (good luck, though, finding a UCS4 encoding
implementation in the base assemblies...).
