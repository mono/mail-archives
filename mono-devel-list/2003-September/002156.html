Hi all.
I think I found a little bug in the BufferedStream.Write() method.

It was checking for the Read permission while I think it should check 
for the *Write* permission.

I didn't do a testcase, I tested with my own program which was using the 
Write method. But I can do one if necessary. I'm looking right now in 
the BufferedStreamTest NUnit file to add a test case.


The patch is attached. It is simple, just change the check.
