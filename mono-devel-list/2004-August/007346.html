I'm not either, and yet I keep posting.  Hmm...

I think that's primarily because 128-bit hardware doesn't exist, at
least not readily.  I don't know of anything that would preclude 128-bit
support in the standards.

&gt;<i> The IntPtr type is designed to be an integer whose size is

</I>
And this is the key point.  *Platform-specific*.  So, in 1000 years when
we have 2048-bit pan-universal super-computers, we can continue using
IntPtr and UIntPtr without any portability problems. :-)  Now *there's*
a software investment...

&gt;<i>  That is, an instance of this type is expected to be
</I>&gt;<i> 32-bits on 32-bit hardware and operating systems, and 64-bits on
</I>&gt;<i> 64-bit hardware and operating systems.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and does not mention any other possibilities.
</I>
Just because other possibilities aren't mentioned doesn't mean they
can't be supported.  To the contrary, the documentation doesn't
specifically state &quot;only 32-bit and 64-bit platforms will ever be
supported,&quot; which would lead one to believe that it isn't specifically
precluded.  It's just not *currently* supported.
