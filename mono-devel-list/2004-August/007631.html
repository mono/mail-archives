<PRE>Dude, plz relax.
 
It was only when I saw your first reply to this topic I recalled that you
said in another topic &quot;I have started working on a program that processes
MSBuild files&quot; after some searching in Outlook.
I was discussing the possible idea to implement MSBuild off the list with
Nathan, but as he is on the road untill friday, we agreed to plan the thing
in the weekend. My idea was to send our plans to the list after we had some
idea of how to tacle this, and ask for community input and whoever wanted to
help. I only responded earlier because roy posted a topic on this.

My apolagies if you feel offended, it wasn't my intention at all.
Once again, if you want to collabarate and think this is achievable to
combine our common goals, please say so. As you have already begun, you
would be a valuable resource to us.

Greetz,
-- Rob.

Subject: Re: [Mono-devel-list] MSBuild implementation

Actually, I do not recall having given much detail on my ideas for 
implementation. However, you seem aware of my interest and efforts, but 
decided not even to attempt collaboration. I'm used to that kind of
affront 
from the Mono community, but it still hurts.

&gt;<i> this is something very different from building a tool that acts

&gt;<i> like MSBuild, including duplicating all namespaces associated with

&gt;<i> tool. This is neccessary when someone extends the tool or doesn't use
</I>the
&gt;<i> tool itself but invokes it programmatically. If we do not duplicate
</I>the

</I>&gt;<i> So as you see, building a tool that processes msbuild files is just a
</I>&gt;<i> 'by-product' of implementing all these namespaces for this project.
</I>&gt;<i> The advantage of your project is that you will finish much faster (I
</I>&gt;<i> think). This would allow other people to convert the makefiles / nant
</I>files
&gt;<i> that build mono to msbuild files a long way before we finish the
</I>&gt;<i> duplication of msbuild.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope you do not feel offended in any way for us taking a different
</I>route,
&gt;<i> but as I pointed out, we have a different goal then yours.
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to join us (now or in a later stage, perhaps when you have
</I>&gt;<i> finished your own project), just ring a bell, you would be a valuable
</I>&gt;<i> resource to us.
