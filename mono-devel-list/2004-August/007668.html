<PRE>Hey everyone,

You thought you were safe, you thought it was dead, but you were wrong!
MBuild 0.0.3.1 is a new release of my overengineered, much-hyped build
system. It is available at:

<A HREF="http://www.newton.cx/~peter/software/mbuild-0.0.3.1.tar.gz">http://www.newton.cx/~peter/software/mbuild-0.0.3.1.tar.gz</A>

MBuild 0.0.3.1 requires Mono 1.0.1 and CVS monodoc. And by &quot;CVS
monodoc&quot;, I mean &quot;I committed a vitally important patch an hour ago.&quot;
All the documentation is now in monodoc format so this caveat is
important.

MBuild 0.0.3.1 is still beta software, although I think it should be
usable for straightforward C# projects. At this point, I am looking to
get developers excited about MBuild and start contributing to make it
industrial-strength and ready for prime-time.

WHAT IS IT?
===========

MBuild is a build system. It aims to enforce good build practices and
encourage cross-platform design while not being too hard to use. I think
of MBuild as &quot;The tool for people who get angry when they even think
about automake.&quot;

WHAT'S NEW?
===========

* Vast improvements, all over the system. Code cleanups, design
improvements, bug fixes, the works.

* There's a new tool called mb-bundlegen that generates &quot;bundles&quot;
(encapsulations of build rules and logic) from a simple file format
using CodeDom. It's pretty neat.

* There's a prototype graphical build configurator call mb-gtkconfig.
(That is, imagine if ./configure could give you an automatically
generated GTK user interface.) 

* There are new bundles supporting the Monodoc documentation assembly,
PkgConfig, and much, much more. 

* There is robust error detection and handling. 

* There is installation and uninstallation, using a diabolically clever
scheme. 

* There is some API documentation (!) for parts of the Mono.Build
assembly.

* The rest of the documentation has been converted into Monodoc format.

WHAT AM I WAITING FOR?
======================

Good question! If you're a slave to the autotools, now's your chance to
break free!
