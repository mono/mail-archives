<PRE>Alright!!

	Thanks for the information. I'm happy to try and help in any way that 
I can. I am not an expert cocoa or objc developer but have been playing 
around with objc/cocoa for about 2 years. Let me know (more concretely) 
how I can be of assistance. I will most definitely try and get cocoa# 
from cvs and look for you all on irc. Can you tell me what the best irc 
client is for Mac (or at least what you guys use?).

							Best,

									-B

</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop/MonoDoc are a different story.   Cocoa# 0.1 will have a
</I>&gt;<i> Cocoa# version of MonoDoc.  MonoDevelop is something that we have 
</I>&gt;<i> having
</I>&gt;<i> problems with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     O.K. I know that I'm complaining, and I don't like complainers 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> very much, so I would like to offer my services to the mono community 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first, as a tester, and then as a developer. I've looked in Objc# and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cocoa# but there doesn't seem to be anything there. Does anyone know 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the status of this project?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Probably the best thing to do is join the #cocoa# channel on
</I>&gt;<i> irc.gnome.org.  That's where we tend to hang.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cocoa# 0.1 should be out today, but may not be downloadable until
</I>&gt;<i> tomorrow.  Objc# is kinda up in the air.  How did you check these
</I>&gt;<i> modules from cvs?  It should be there, but I don't know how old the
</I>&gt;<i> versions would be as I don't know how often the anonymous cvs side is
</I>&gt;<i> updated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I would like to get MonoDevelop up and running on the Mac. I have 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tried to follow the directions on go-mono but, they do not seem to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work for me. I think the problem has to do with fink and some of the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dependencies on gtk+2 etc. If someone were willing to hold my hand 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> while I perform the installation and configuration, I'd be more than 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happy to write up a &quot;lessons learned&quot; document to post on the Mono or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> independent site. Any takers??
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Geoff (Kangaroo) has done the most work on this.  He is gone camping
</I>&gt;<i> until Tuesday, but I'm sure he will help you when he gets back.  Also 
</I>&gt;<i> we
</I>&gt;<i> would like to get a somewhat stable MoneDevelop out for Mono 1.0.1, so
</I>&gt;<i> your help could be very valuable.
