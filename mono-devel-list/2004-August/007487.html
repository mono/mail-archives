<PRE>Well, you are mixing things.

First, Perl isn't a Mono/.NET language, so if you want to write web
services in Mono, it is better to use the many languages already
available in Mono (C#, Nemerle, Boo, IronPython, ...). Just to be
completely fair, ActiveState had an effort to mix Perl and .NET, but
it was a mixed environment (Perl Interpreter alongside the CLR
(virtual machine)) with some bridging, so the results weren't as good
as using some of the above mentioned languages.

Second, if you just want to be able call Mono classes from Perl,
that's is feasible using the embedding APIs but in your case not very
worthy, because Mono/ASP.NET Web Services Infrastructure does a lot
for you and then calls your code and then does a lot of other things,
not the reverse. So unless you wan't to rewrite large portions of that
infrastructure in Perl.

Finally, you may be tempted to write a Perl Interpreter in C#/Mono, or
call the Perl executable by shelling out to it, so that you'd be able
to execute Perl Scripts inside Web Services hosted by Mono, but the
glue logic you'll need to write to make it simple to use is enormous
or else custom glue logic would be needed to be written for every web
service.

I may have totally misunderstood your intentions, so if you want to
further discuss it, please post here a more detailed plan, with some
good/solid questions about it.

It may help to think of Mono/Web Services support more like Web
Services Server (either own simple XSP server, or the Apache/Mod_Mono
server combination).

Greetings,
