<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Maybe you dont see my point yet, but in my real application i ran
</I>&gt;<i> into situation when serializer is unusable, though if i wrote XML
</I>&gt;<i> manually or had serializer that could just &quot;fill&quot; the properties 
</I>&gt;<i> and that could serialize also interfaces, it would work perfectly
</I>&gt;<i> for me.
</I>
So? Please understand my points why I said your suggestion is not
acceptable in my previous post:

	- It is &quot;design change&quot; and the way you suggested affects
	  on all other XmlSerializable class developers.

	- XmlSerializer is not all-purpose utility and it is
	  natural that it does not meet your need. XmlSerializer
	  is not to blame. It's by design.

You could design and implement a new (your own) XML serialization
framework other than Microsoft one. You know, the API is originally
designed by Microsoft. If you really want such one you suggested,
asking Microsoft people would be the fastest way. We won't make our
MS-compatibility library API incompatible with MS ones.
