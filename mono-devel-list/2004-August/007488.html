<PRE>Rafael,

Thanks for the quick answer. Strangely enough, there is a fourth 
interpretation. I don't want use .NET on the server side at all. I do, 
however, want to use .NET on the client (MS discontinues SOAP support 
soon). Hence, I'd like to catch .NET requests on the server in a 
language of my choice and respond without using .NET at all.

Web Services are a protocol, right? Are they just an RPC mechanism 
similar to SOAP or are they a more involved thing that requires a very 
specific smart server program that utilizes specific .NET classes?

Thanks,
Simon

Terrorism is a tactic and so to declare war on terrorism
is equivalent to Roosevelt's declaring war on blitzkrieg.
