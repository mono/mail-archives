<PRE>Hello folks,

I was going through the todo list and saw the entry
for the MSbuild tool.

i am very keen on working on this. Currently the site
says unassigned. In case no one has taken it yet I
would like to start work on that. Of course if someone
else has already started off with it i would love to
contribute.

I am new to the list, so here is some background about
me.

I am currently a lead with one of the service
companies in india. Started of working on information
retrieval software written in C++ and STL. 

Had to make the switch to MS technologies and started
working on COM. Intially started working with .NET
when  my company was trying to demo our product with
.NET Beta 1 using COM interop.

Anyhow recently has a chance to work with the VJ# team
at microsoft in India. 

Yeah so that's about me.

I am not quite sure how work gets assigned.
Any pointers would help.

But as I said I would like to work on the
implementatio n of MSBuild tool for Mono.

Regards
Roy
