It's been a while since I read about the AS/400 achitecture, but I think
that the AS/400 uses a *modified* PowerPC chip that has special support
for the AS/400 memory model.

The AS/400 memory model is very interesting because it doesn't allow
native machine code to do pointer arithmetic. Only privileged code can
create pointers. In the pre-PowerPC days, every memory word had an
additional (hidden) bit that signaled if the word contained a valid
pointer or not. This bit couldn't be manipulated from user code (wasn't
even visible). I don't know how they do it nowadays.

Regards,
Jeroen
