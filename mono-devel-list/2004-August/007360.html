Which is why specifications should be very clear. :-)

It's all a thought exercise, until it gets implemented.

&gt;<i> I believe there is more evidence that 128bit pointers (as in ones with

</I>
This doesn't make any sense to me.  How do I sign-extend or zero-extend
a 64-bit IntPtr to a int64?  They're the same size!  No extension is
required at all.

This would really only be a concern when converting a 32-bit IntPtr to
an int64 -- *that's* when you'd have an extension of some form.

Relying on a sign-/zero-extension would likely be non-portable, as
reliance would break 64-bit addressing (the extension would occur with
32-bit pointers, but not 64-bit pointers, resulting in different
performance, resulting in portability issues).

I would hope that the spec would be clarified.
