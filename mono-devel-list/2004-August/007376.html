<PRE>Ooh, that is Fusion. 

Well we surely don't support it as it is COM-based, but we also don't
need to, because in the unixy tradition you can call gacutil in a
child process and give it any parameters you need and retrieve what it
says about the GAC content.

That, factoring out some extensions we have in our gacutil, even may
work with .NET in Windows, and is far safer/easier than writing COM
code to use a mostly undocumented/unsupported API like Fusion.

Thanks, Mads, for bringing this to our attention, anyway.

As for your original question, Gonzalo complemented what I said: even
csc use a simple response file to know what to automatically
reference.

My csc.rsp for .NET 1.1 says:

&lt;snip&gt;
# This file contains command-line options that the C#
# command line compiler (CSC) will process as part
# of every compilation, unless the &quot;/noconfig&quot; option
# is specified. 

# Reference the common Framework libraries
/r:Accessibility.dll
/r:Microsoft.Vsa.dll
/r:System.Configuration.Install.dll
/r:System.Data.dll
/r:System.Design.dll
/r:System.DirectoryServices.dll
/r:System.dll
/r:System.Drawing.Design.dll
/r:System.Drawing.dll
/r:System.EnterpriseServices.dll
/r:System.Management.dll
/r:System.Messaging.dll
/r:System.Runtime.Remoting.dll
/r:System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.dll
/r:System.Security.dll
/r:System.ServiceProcess.dll
/r:System.Web.dll
/r:System.Web.Mobile.dll
/r:System.Web.RegularExpressions.dll
/r:System.Web.Services.dll
/r:System.Windows.Forms.Dll
/r:System.XML.dll
&lt;/snip&gt;

Note that some of them are unimplemented, or just stubbed, in mono.

Have fun,
