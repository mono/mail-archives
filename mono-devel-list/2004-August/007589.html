<PRE>Hi,

I might have incorrectly posted to mono-list about this so bear with me if 
that is not the place to be. My problem follows:

I am using mono for research. I am figuring if it is possible, in the 
runtime (i.e. the 'C' world), to suspend all user/system threads?

I would like to freeze the whole runtime execution and gather information, 
and then let execution resume. I would imagine the GC would do something 
similar. The closest I found are 2 methods:

mono_gc_start_world()
mono_gc_stop_world()

However, it doesn't seem to behave the way I expect. If any JIT/runtime 
people could give me a hint, it would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks very much
-Derek
