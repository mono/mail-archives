&lt;originalQuestion&gt;
Can you develope for Compact Framework with Mono? 8/17/2004 2:04 AM
Can you develope apps for .net Compact Framework for Pocket Pc's with Mono?	 
&lt;/originalQuestion&gt;
&lt;myAnswer&gt;
Rafael	  	8/19/2004 7:15 AM

The short answer is yes, but not easily, and the reasons are:

1 - mcs doesn't have and mbas doesn't implement yet the -netcf option,
to restrict some constructions in the generated file.

2 - mcs doesn't have and mbas doesn't implement yet the -sdkpath:path
option, needed to compile targetting the subset of the framework
available in the compact framework version.

3 - we don't build an equivalent smaller (crippled, in my opinion) set
of libraries and you are forbidden by the EULA to use the netcf ones
to compile against them with mono

Anyway, you can compile programs/libraries with mono and run them on
netcf. I heard that people like to use our System.Xml implementation
there because it is complete unlike the netcf's
&lt;/myAnswer&gt;
&lt;/pasted&gt;

Should we pursue such compatibility? -sdkpath:path may pose problems
inside the referenced assembly loading/name-resolution parts of our
compilers.

Well, searching a bit I see that -netcf is not available with csc, so
mcs won't need it either,

Fun,
