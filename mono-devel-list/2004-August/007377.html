Thanks so much for the testing!

Sorry, when I uploaded the packages, I just globbed for
mono*1.0.1*i386.rpm, and I forgot that we have 2 packages whose name
does not start with &quot;mono-&quot;. I'll upload them later today.

&gt;<i> 3. I also attempted to install mod-mono, but looks like the apache component

mod_mono is not being packaged. You'll have to build and install it from
source.

&gt;<i> You'll notice that many packages are missing in the 1.0.1 release. Is v1.0.1
</I>&gt;<i> supposed to be installed over 1.0.0 as an upgrade-only option?
</I>
Last night was just a preview run of the release and I do know that not
all the packages are listed there. They'll be fixed today.

Duncan.
