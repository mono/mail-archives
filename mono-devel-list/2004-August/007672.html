Hi all,

after having a little issue here with gacutil, I could only figure out 
where exactly the problem was after adding the output of the directory 
gacutil was tring to create when it was saying me it couldn't register 
an assmembly in gac.

So, I think that for people, (like me), who doesn't know all the 
internals of gac yet and is a little lost with this message looking for 
what this dir was, I created the following patch which shows the exact 
dir which the operation was being attempted to.

I hope it helps.

Regards,

Francisco Figueiredo Jr.
