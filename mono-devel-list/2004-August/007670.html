<PRE>Hey,

&gt;<i> Okay. When it is, will it be able to compile ECMA 262 compliant JavaScript  
</I>&gt;<i> to CLR code and execute it in the same manner as Helma is (through Rhino)?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> &gt; He is right about this.  Mono and IKVM are not as tuned as pure Java, so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unless using .NET is a priority, using plain Java is probably a better
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; path.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is it a focus or priority for Novell or anyone affiliated or working with  
</I>&gt;<i> Mono to make the Mono-&gt;IKVM-&gt;Java connection tighter, faster and more  
</I>&gt;<i> optimized?
</I>
It is not a priority at this point for us, but Mono has just been out
for a few weeks, so it will depend on user's needs:  our priorities
will likely be shaped by Novell's customer needs.

But that should not stop anyone from taking things into their own
hands.

For example, Mainsoft needs to use ASP.NET and ADO.NET, and they did
not wait for Novell to make it a priority, they actively engaged and
got some fantastic developers to develop and help in the process.

Miguel
