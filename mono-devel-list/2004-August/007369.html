How do one get the standard set of .dlls? That is, the ones which it
is _not_ necessary to include (with -r) when compiling programs.

In MS .net I suspect one could use some fusion stuff. Would this also
work in Mono?

However, fusion seems to be complicated and not that well
documented. Are there any easier ways?

If fusion works in Mono, do anybody have some nice documentation /
examples?

Greetings,

Mads Lindstr&#248;m
