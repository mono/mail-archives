<PRE>I think you are mistaken here.
In terms of being part of .Net C++ is less portable (if portable at all -&gt; thats why even your supersimple app won't run).
It's likely to run much slower than C# when running only within the .Net environment.
The advantages do only exist if you use mixed native and managed code. However then you are not portable and (imho even more important) you cannot write any assembly with security context (which I assume could be used as primary contol mechanism for security in Longhorn).

So you see C++ does lack quite some things.
IL ist currently neither optimized nor particulary suited for C++. Its much more optimized for C# and even VB.Net
  Well, since C++ does not lack anything that C# has, why waste time learning C#? Not to mention that C++/CLI is better than C# (managed objects in the stack, deterministic finalisation etc), not to mention the better optimisation of IL for C++ including the upcoming POGO optimisation in VC++ 2005, templates with managed types along with generics and the list is too long.

  That said, C# is OK too, but I will stick with C++. Language neutrally speaking, C++ is more widespread than C# and VB so I suppose it should be supported by Mono because this would also drive more developers to Mono. Also this would not force C++ developers to stick with MS.
