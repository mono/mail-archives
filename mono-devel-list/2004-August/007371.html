<PRE>I have discovered that sn doesn't work on Solaris because of a file locking
issue.

The file being signed ends up being mapped in memory (to gets its
AssemblyName)
and then a fcntl(F_SETLK) is attempted and this fails with EAGAIN. This
works
on Linux. Looking at the man pages Solaris (2.8) just says the fcntl fails
if the file
is memory mapped. Linux adds &quot;by another process&quot;. So both are behaving as
expected.

The question is how to address this - for my own use for the moment I just
ignore
the EAGAIN failure and go on and the signing succeeds. I can't immediately
think
of a good alternative to this. I think sn itself shouldn't have to change to
cope with
this. Anyone have alternatives?
