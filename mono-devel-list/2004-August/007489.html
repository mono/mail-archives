<PRE>So what do you want to do is to publish some Web Services written in
Perl to being consumed from a .NET client (That is the current
official wording for such a thing).

As long as you present good WSDL, it should have no problem, unless
your client wants support for newer features like WS-Security that may
not be available in your Perl modules, and may be hard to write code
to support correctly.

Write your services, describe them in wsdl, and use mono's wsdl tool
to generate the proxy classes in C# that correctly call your services,
and can be used by the client code.

Good developments,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, you are mixing things.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; First, Perl isn't a Mono/.NET language, so if you want to write web
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; services in Mono, it is better to use the many languages already
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; available in Mono (C#, Nemerle, Boo, IronPython, ...). Just to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; completely fair, ActiveState had an effort to mix Perl and .NET, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it was a mixed environment (Perl Interpreter alongside the CLR
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (virtual machine)) with some bridging, so the results weren't as good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as using some of the above mentioned languages.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Second, if you just want to be able call Mono classes from Perl,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that's is feasible using the embedding APIs but in your case not very
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; worthy, because Mono/ASP.NET Web Services Infrastructure does a lot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for you and then calls your code and then does a lot of other things,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not the reverse. So unless you wan't to rewrite large portions of that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; infrastructure in Perl.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Finally, you may be tempted to write a Perl Interpreter in C#/Mono, or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; call the Perl executable by shelling out to it, so that you'd be able
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to execute Perl Scripts inside Web Services hosted by Mono, but the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; glue logic you'll need to write to make it simple to use is enormous
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or else custom glue logic would be needed to be written for every web
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; service.
