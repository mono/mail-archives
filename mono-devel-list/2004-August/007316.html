<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>A general code question. Does the mono runtime make extensive use of the
casting of pointers to integral types and then casting back to a
pointer, expecting the pointer to be useable?

The reason I ask is that this has implications for portability. The C
std, as far as I recall, does not guarantee that a pointer cast from an
integral type will be useable. On platforms which have pointers that are
larger than int or long this becomes a real concern.

So, I am asking someone that might be extensively familiar with the mono
code whether this is likely to be a big concern to someone trying to
port mono to a platform as described above?
