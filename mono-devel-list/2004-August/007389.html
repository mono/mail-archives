</I>I think you can't find it because it doesn't exist. Here's what should
be happening:

1. gtk-sharp loads a library, addressing it by it's win32 library name
2. mono's runtime mappings mechanism goes &quot;aha! I know that dll, you
really want this .so file&quot;
3. mono loads the .so file, instead of the dll

What appears to be happening is that the mappings stuff isn't working properly. There are several ways that this could happen.
1. The mapping information is being seen but some error is happening as mono tries to use it. To diagnose this sort of error, try exporting these two environment variables, then running monodevelop again.
export MONO_LOG_LEVEL=debug
export MONO_LOG_MASK=dll
2. The mapping information isn't even being seen. For a while, this happened a lot because people still had pre-gac gtk-sharp
assemblies installed on their system somewhere, because the mappings
mechanism changed when the gac was introduced but old gtk-sharp
assemblies depend on that change not having happened. You're sure you
don't have any such assemblies sitting around? A popular way of
acquiring them was to fail to uninstall 0.31 before installing beta1.

If neither of those options are useful, you might like to try poking
around a bit. You'll find the
gtk-sharp mappings in a folder named something like $prefix/lib/mono/gac/gtk-sharp/1.0.0.0__35e10195dab3c99f/gtk-sharp.dll.config
