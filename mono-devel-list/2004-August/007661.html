<PRE>As I was cruising throught he mono mailing lists I saw that xsp is
working on Mac OS X as of the 1.0.1 release.  The go-mono.com website
states that mod_mono and xsp aren't yet working, which I'm guessing is
just out of date?

Is xsp included in the .dmg installation?  Or do I have to install it
seperately?  I came across a couple posts that made it sound like I'd
need to grab the source from cvs and build it myself but I wasn't sure
if that was completely up to date.  Can anyone provide me with some
guidance on getting XSP rocking and rolling on Mac OS X?

Thanks,
Steve
