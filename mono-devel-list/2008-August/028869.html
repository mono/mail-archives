<PRE>
I was wondering...    I am building a home-finance application for mono [so I
can access it anywhere via PuTTY on win machines].    There's been quite a
bit of work done already on mono-curses for a rudimentary widget and dialog
library, but it could use a lot more:


- Text editor widget
- Calendar control
- Time picking control
- reg-expr powered edit fields
- Menu bar


I have written my own changes to mono API code in the past to do things I
want to do, but in this particular case I would like to contribute them back
up the chain.

Is there a &quot;Monodeveloper For Dummies&quot; guide for new developers who want to
join a project and how to get on a particular project such as mono-curses?
