<PRE>I have one problem for last several month and would like to ask you
all to help me solve it. There is a bug I submitted long time ago:
<A HREF="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=398318.">https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=398318.</A> It was already
marked as solved by development team as they were unable to reproduce
it. I still have the bug and I would like to know if I am the only one
who reproduce it.

So please try test case attached to bug description. As you can see I
attached screenshots with the bug and received reply with screencast
where bug doesn't appear.

To be clear it never worked for right for me. I decided to upgrade my
Suse to 11 and install brand new Mono 2.0 Preview. And I still have
the problem. I have seen screencast and have no idea why it isn't
working for me.

Any guess? Can it be a problem with database provider??

Please help as it is last think that stops me from migrating to Mono.
Any advices very appreciated.
