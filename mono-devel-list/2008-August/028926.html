<PRE>&gt;<i> 1) On screenshot you can see that there is a problem with buttons 
</I>&gt;<i> alignment in &quot;New image&quot; dialog.
</I>
Yep, that's definitely a bug.

&gt;<i> 2) MDI broken again. Next code cause a message box with error:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> var child = new Form {MdiParent = this};
</I>&gt;<i> child.Show();
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> error is next: Failed to create window, calss 'SWFClass0' Error: 0
</I>
If that's for paint-mono, it is being ported to run on Linux.  It will 
not run on Windows.  If that's a general bug, please file it.

&gt;<i> 3) You asked post bug reports. OK. I looked in tracker - there are 171 
</I>&gt;<i> bugs only in SWF (some of them are mine). Some bugs assigned to 
</I>&gt;<i> developers. But most of them not assigned. What do you plan to do with 
</I>&gt;<i> such bugs? Will you ignore them and make 2.0 release?
</I>
We do our best to fix as many of them as we can.  However, they may or 
may not be fixed in the future depending on their severity and our 
manpower.  This is expected with all software development.  All 
non-trivial software is released with known bugs.

For example:
Winforms has ~180 open bugs.
Mono has ~1050 open bugs.
Ubuntu has ~46,500 open bugs.
Apache's httpd has ~840 open bugs.
Firefox has ~14,300 open bugs.
