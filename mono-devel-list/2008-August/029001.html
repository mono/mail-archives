<PRE>Dear Petit,

Yeah, I figured there was some reference to the source files. But I'm a web developer and not a C programmer. So even if I look through the source code, I wouldn't know what to do. I'm hoping someone here might be able to explain to me if this is infact a bug in Mono or not. I'm thinking it probably is seeing as how my web app works in Windows just fine.

Can anyone please take a look and let me know what the problem is. I'm desperately trying to get my app ported to Linux and Mono and this is stopping me. At least tell me if it is a bug and if it is fixable or not.

Thanks.

I'm not Mono or ASP expert and Mono team should better answer, but it
  seem you have line number who refer to mono source code
  &quot;C:\cygwin\tmp\monobuild\build\.........&quot;

  &gt; Petit, Marek, Thanks for the responses so far.

  &gt; I (finally) got XSP2 and Mono to run in debug mode and now there are line
  &gt; numbers into the code files that show up on the error page. Below is what I
  &gt; am getting:

  &gt; Does that mean anything to anyone? In the above error that is referring to
  &gt; my Default.aspx page, line 37 and 41 are simply the Dialog control that I am
  &gt; using.
  &gt;
  &gt; I have no clue how to read through the source code of mono for the other .cs
  &gt; files. If anyone can help I would REALLY appreciate it.
  &gt;
  &gt; Thank you.
  &gt;
  &gt; Zee.

  &gt;&gt; Dear Eric,
  &gt;&gt;
  &gt;&gt; Thanks for the response.
  &gt;&gt;
  &gt;&gt; I ran the ComponentArt DLL through the MoMA and everything turned out
  &gt;&gt; fine. There
  &gt;&gt; were no PInvokes and no missing Mono functionality.
  &gt;&gt; As to where the error is coming up, I know exactly where it's happening. I
  &gt;&gt; started
  &gt;&gt; a blank aspx page and placed 2 controls in it. One of them is a Dialog
  &gt;&gt; control and
  &gt;&gt; then, inside this dialog control, I placed a text box. When I ran this
  &gt;&gt; through
  &gt;&gt; IIS, it worked fine. However, when I ran it with Mono, I got the same
  &gt;&gt; error below.
  &gt;&gt; Realistically, I don't need to declare these controls using &quot;new&quot; at
  &gt;&gt; runtime as I
  &gt;&gt; am not creating them dynamically. They are already on the page. However,
  &gt;&gt; if this
  &gt;&gt; is a Mono workaround, I guess I'll have to try that. But where should I
  &gt;&gt; declare
  &gt;&gt; these controls? In the PageLoad()? And regarding your other solution about
  &gt;&gt; tracing, unfortunately, I'm not that experienced with doing this sort of
  &gt;&gt; stuff. I
  &gt;&gt; just thought that I couldn't be the only person here with this problem.
  &gt;&gt; I'm sure
  &gt;&gt; someone else must have had some project where a control is contained
  &gt;&gt; within
  &gt;&gt; another control :p Any ideas? I really need this to work or else it will
  &gt;&gt; effectively kill my web app's cross-platformness :( Zee _____
  &gt; It's most likely a bug in Mono. It's hard to fix it given the information in
  &gt; your
  &gt; previous mail, though. Could you, please, run the application with mono
  &gt; --debug (and
  &gt; make sure that &lt;compilation debug=&quot;true&quot;/&gt; is present in your web.config),
  &gt; then
  &gt; post the backtrace together with the generated file. That will give more
  &gt; information
  &gt; and make it easier to see what's going on.
  &gt;
  &gt; regards,
  &gt;
  &gt; marek
