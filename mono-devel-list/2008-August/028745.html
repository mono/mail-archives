Don't worry, I did not take your post that way.
I *know* dtrace is a different thing, even if I have never used it.

I was trying to say the following:

[1] If you want dtrace hooks for every enter-exit method, the easiest
way to &#65279;implement them is inside a profiler module that uses the
existing enter-exit profiling hooks.
This has its downsides: you must start the runtime enabling this &quot;dtrace
profiler module&quot;, and at this point the overhead is not zero.
However it seems so easy to do that it could be useful anyway if you
need the feature &quot;now&quot; instead of in a few weeks or months.

[2] Anyway, if you want to extend the JIT to insert enter and exit
&quot;empty dtrace hooks&quot; to every method, it's very likely that you should
reuse (and extend) the existing prologue-epilogue instrumentation code
instead of trying to reinvent it.

[3] As nice as dtrace can be, we don't have it on Linux, and our main
focus is Linux. Here, the easiest way you have to log all enter-exit
events efficiently is the &quot;c&quot; option of the logging profiler, so I
explained how to use it for that purpose in case somebody needed it now.

Of course the logging profiler is not dtrace :-)
And of course there's place for both in the world...

My points [1] and [2] are suggestions on how to get those dtrace hooks
into Mono, point [3] is about how to get something similar without using
dtrace.

Anyway, I get your point that dtrace hooks are conditional, and the
conditions can be given dynamically as D scripts.
This is something we miss in Mono-land, and can cut the event bandwidth
significantly.
So, to answer my question, maybe dtrace would be slower than the logging
profiler in logging individual enter-exit events, but typically when
using dtrace you will never ask the system to log *all* of them, you
will select them with a D script, so the resulting event bandwidth will
be much slower and the performance acceptable.
Did I get it right?

Thanks!
