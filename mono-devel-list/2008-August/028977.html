<PRE>Petit, Marek, Thanks for the responses so far.  
   
I (finally) got XSP2 and Mono to run in debug mode and now there are line numbers into the code files that show up on the error page. Below is what I am getting:  
   
  
Server Error in '/' Application
    _____  

    
Object reference not set to an instance of an object
  

Description: HTTP 500. Error processing request.

  Version information: Mono Version: 2.0.50727.42; ASP.NET Version: 2.0.50727.42  

   

Does that mean anything to anyone? In the above error that is referring to my Default.aspx page, line 37 and 41 are simply the Dialog control that I am using.  

I have no clue how to read through the source code of mono for the other .cs files. If anyone can help I would REALLY appreciate it.  

Thank you.  

Zee.

</I>It's most likely a bug in Mono. It's hard to fix it given the information in your
previous mail, though. Could you, please, run the application with mono --debug (and
make sure that &lt;compilation debug=&quot;true&quot;/&gt; is present in your web.config), then
post the backtrace together with the generated file. That will give more information
and make it easier to see what's going on.

regards,

marek
