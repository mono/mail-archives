</I>&gt;<i> I ran the ComponentArt DLL through the MoMA and everything turned out fine. There

</I>&gt;<i> As to where the error is coming up, I know exactly where it's happening. I started

</I>&gt;<i> Realistically, I don't need to declare these controls using &quot;new&quot; at runtime as I

</I>&gt;<i> is a Mono workaround, I guess I'll have to try that. But where should I declare
</I>&gt;<i> these controls? In the PageLoad()? And regarding your other solution about
</I>&gt;<i> tracing, unfortunately, I'm not that experienced with doing this sort of stuff. I
</I>&gt;<i> just thought that I couldn't be the only person here with this problem. I'm sure
</I>&gt;<i> someone else must have had some project where a control is contained within
</I>&gt;<i> another control :p Any ideas? I really need this to work or else it will
</I>&gt;<i> effectively kill my web app's cross-platformness :( Zee _____  
</I>It's most likely a bug in Mono. It's hard to fix it given the information in your
previous mail, though. Could you, please, run the application with mono --debug (and
make sure that &lt;compilation debug=&quot;true&quot;/&gt; is present in your web.config), then
post the backtrace together with the generated file. That will give more information
and make it easier to see what's going on.
