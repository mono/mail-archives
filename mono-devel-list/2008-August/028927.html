Hello,

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) You asked post bug reports. OK. I looked in tracker - there are 171 
</I>&gt;<i> bugs only in SWF (some of them are mine). Some bugs assigned to 
</I>&gt;<i> developers. But most of them not assigned. What do you plan to do with 
</I>&gt;<i> such bugs? Will you ignore them and make 2.0 release?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Developing the implementation of Windows.Forms has proven to be a tricky
thing - sometimes there are some undocumented behaviours and bits hidden
somewhere, that appear until a user follows a specific path.

Now, we try to prioritise the bugs we have, and fix them based on that.
We assign them as soon as somebody is done with some bugs and goes for
the next ones. What do we try with those bugs? Fix them, of course. We
can't ignore them, but it's not logical no stop the entire release for
only a part of the class library. We have an agenda, an we try to fix as
much bugs as possible, with the small team we have.

But this is free software after all, and sure you can help us if you
think it's a bad thing to have so many bugs opened.

And, btw, in general we feel we mwf is stable in general, but not
perfect (yet ;-D ).

Carlos.
