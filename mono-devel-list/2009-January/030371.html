<PRE>sorry if I have not looked over the mono codebase enough to really know all 
this for myself.

how much does mono depend on the specifics of its existing CLI / JIT 
implementation?...
how much does it depend on Boehm and like?...

this is in the context of both technical, and in terms of project politics 
(what is the &quot;essence&quot; of the project and so on).

for example, would it be &quot;compatible&quot; with the project for someone to 
substitute in their own implementation of EMCA-335 and like, and have much 
expectation that everything on top of this will continue working (for 
example, as far as all the libraries are concerned, the CLI implementation 
is a &quot;black box&quot;), or is it more the case that there is some important 
dependency on the internals of the CLI implementation?

(I wouldn't think there would be &quot;that&quot; much dependency, but I could easily 
be wrong...).


more so, if one were to swap out for a different CLI implementation 
(assuming it is within reasonable technical limitations), would it still be 
classified as &quot;the same project&quot;, or as &quot;some other project making use of 
the libraries and tools&quot;.


well, ok, a little context:
I have my own framework, and &quot;may&quot; do an implementation of the CLI as well 
(provided time and direction), but if it is possible to do this within the 
confines of being &quot;cooperative&quot; with the project, this would be good.

my project also does not use Boehm, rather, I do my own GC. it is currently 
conservative, but I have considered the possibility of later implementing a 
&quot;hybrid&quot; conservative/precise GC (preciseness would be added as a set of 
extensions and alterations to the existing GC, and would be intended mostly 
to allow improving performance and reducing garbage creation).

I am also not all that likely to re-use the existing CLI engine, as 
personally I find the code... displeasing...

FWIW, all my stuff is currently generally being developed under the LGPL.

or such...
