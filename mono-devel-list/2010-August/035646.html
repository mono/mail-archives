<PRE>Hi,
thank you for the hint to mono_tread_attach. I should spend more time with
RTFM. Now using this I was able to get beyond the init and the attach but
crashed again at the creation of a seperate app_domain. While this might be
accepted, since I could create the app domain in the main thread as well I
finally got stuck with the following error upon  mono_domain_assembly_open
(not using app domains at all).

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
