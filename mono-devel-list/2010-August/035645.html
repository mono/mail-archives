Given that mono_jit_init() can't be called more than once per
process, you could just call it from the main thread and forget
about the issue after you've filed a bug at
<A HREF="http://mono-project.com/Bugs">http://mono-project.com/Bugs</A> :)

The real work (compiling and executing your C# &quot;scripts&quot;) can be
performed from a separate thread, but don't forget to call
mono_thread_attach(domain) from this thread.
