&gt;<i> xbuild (mono's msbuild equivalent) is being extended to support vs2005

Thanks - I was not aware of xbuild.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for now, company I'm working for is using NAnt together with custom
</I>&gt;<i> script that generates VS2005 projects from the NAnt *.build files.
</I>&gt;<i> This is a bit hackish, and NAnt has it's shortcomings (eg. is a bit
</I>&gt;<i> bugged), but it's the best solution we had tested (our project started
</I>&gt;<i> on mono+linux, now it is also developed on mono+windows/ms.net+windows
</I>&gt;<i> by several developers). cmake looks promissing, but as you said, it
</I>&gt;<i> currently lacks certain features.
</I>
I noticed, that the newest mono release includes nant 0.85-rc-something, 
whereas no nant is released as part of version 1.1.13.8?

This is quite confusing. What are the directions of the mono project? Is there 
a commitment from Novell (or someone else) on the xbuild project, or should 
we rather look at nant? (Would you care to share you scripts, btw?)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Optimally, xbuild would support new msbuild format files, and
</I>&gt;<i> switching between mono and ms.net would be a complete no brainer :-)
</I>
Yes, this would be ideel. I am not a big MS fan myself, but it seems that 
MSBuild is a sensible system (inspired by nant, apparently). Having a 
compatible crossplatform tool for mono would appear to be a good thing. 
Especially since this would allow the Windows developers to remain in Visual 
Studio all the time, which appears to be a high priority for them...

Regards,

Mads
