Yes, I understand that. I was not expecting register allocator to do 
instruction scheduling. :)
My first question was - is there way to ask it to use different physical 
registers
for next instruction or reserve it for next n (where in n - 
configuriable) instructions. In my example it
would not use the same register (from 2nd instruction) for 3rd 
instuction. As far as I recall it is called
read/write dependency and if it was defferent register alpha would 
schedule the 3rd instruction with the 2nd
at the same time. I think it might be true for other arches too. This is 
just a thought.

I guess this is because the next instructions is one of store to memory 
or move to another register as 32bit integer.
I stepped on it because alpha doesn't have 32bit compare and my 
not-negative 64 int wasn't converted and long
compare failed.
