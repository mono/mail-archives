<PRE>Hi,

I'm new with Mono and C#. I come from java world. I think you are doing a 
great job, congratulations! I've to admit that mono (C#) language are more 
powerful than java. Events is one thing I miss in high level languages.

I did'n understand some things. Why the effort for be 100% compatible with 
Microsoft, if they did'nt want to be compatibles with nothing???

Specially with assemblies. I think there is many good things in Java than C#. 
Why re-code the wheel? C# assemblies are all but friendly and are designer by 
#!$#@#. I know it's not your fault.

Someone can explain why System.Collection.IList has Item[]???? A list is not 
an array!!!! Maybe ToArray() method that returns an array?

I miss a lot of classes, specially Collections class. List, Map, Set... I 
think the main power of Java is that you as programmer only have to worrier 
about your own problem, not implementing a lot of common stuff code.

I'm not sure if I'm in the right mail-list, sorry if I'm wrong.

Thanks

Fran
