<PRE>Hi guys,

I've hesitated for quite some time before writing that email, but it 
seems like I've come to a point where I won't be able to progress with 
my project without a bit of help from outside.
First of all, what for a project is that? It's a mind mapping solution 
written in C#, using Gtk# and hopefully cairo (www.psycho-project.org).
As an extension of that project I'm planning to use it something that I 
call &quot;mindtop&quot; (www.psycho-project.org/mindtop.html), but that is 
distant future.

What kind of help do I need? Well, first of all I don't want anyone to 
write any code for me. Of course, I don't mind any contributions but I 
treat that project as a way of learning so the more I do myself the more 
I'll learn. It's just a bit of guidance and mentoring that should help 
me get through the more advanced tasks. Since SoC is over and everyone 
who acted as mentor may miss it, I figured I may offer an alternative.

At the moment the biggest job in front of me is writing canvas widget 
for that application and frankly, I have no idea how to approach that.
So if you're comfortable with cairo and you can explain me how to 
implement things in C#, please get in touch with me.

Hope to hear from someone. :-)

Cheers
piotr
