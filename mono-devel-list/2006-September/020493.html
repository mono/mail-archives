<PRE>xbuild (mono's msbuild equivalent) is being extended to support vs2005
files, but the works are progressing slowly. (MSBuild is used
internally by VS and SD to build projects).

As for now, company I'm working for is using NAnt together with custom
script that generates VS2005 projects from the NAnt *.build files.
This is a bit hackish, and NAnt has it's shortcomings (eg. is a bit
bugged), but it's the best solution we had tested (our project started
on mono+linux, now it is also developed on mono+windows/ms.net+windows
by several developers). cmake looks promissing, but as you said, it
currently lacks certain features.

Optimally, xbuild would support new msbuild format files, and
switching between mono and ms.net would be a complete no brainer :-)

&gt;<i> Hi there

</I>&gt;<i> My company is developing a (non-GUI) product that eventually will need to be

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently the development takes place on Windows, using MS VS .net 2005.
</I>&gt;<i> However, we are adding new developers (including me), which are developing in
</I>&gt;<i> a Linux based environment. This means, that we would like to have a build
</I>&gt;<i> environment that is supported both under VSNET05 and Linux/Mono.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, I understand that MonoDevelop and prj2make has been able to work with

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alternatively, what soloutions could you recommend in supporting both
</I>&gt;<i> environments from some sort of common build specification at the same time?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I looked at cmake, which have the ability to generate project files for
</I>&gt;<i> VSNET05 and makefiles for Linux from a general specification file, but using
</I>&gt;<i> cmake would require extending it with support for C#.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also looked briefly at nAnt, which looks good, but the initial comment from
</I>&gt;<i> the Windows developers has been that they feel it lacks integration with
</I>&gt;<i> Visual Studio .net 2005.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Comments on these solutions, general advise, etc, very much welcomed. I
</I>&gt;<i> imagine we are not the only company that has faced this kind of problem?
