<PRE>Hi Dee,

To run ASP.net 2.0 applications you need to use xsp2 instead of xsp. You can
find the options to do this in the mono sections of your apache config.

Getting ASP.net project support in monodevelop was unsuccessful for me. You
have to compile it with the --enable-aspnet option. Also the
--enable-aspnetedit if you want to use a WYSIWIG ASP.net editor, although
this creates extra dependencies which I had difficulty getting to build.
When I did compile the latest version with ASP.net support there was still
no ASP.net project type to be seen when creating a new project. Also,
running ASP.net 2.0 projects which were compiled in Visual Studio 2005
creates errors with the 1.1.17 version of mono.

My personal recommendation would be to stick with ASP.net 1.1 on mono or use
the Microsoft .net framework until the mono project gets a bit further on
with their support for 2.0. YMMV.

Best,
Matt

Subject: [Mono-dev] Visual Web MonoDeveloper

Dear List,
I was using Visual Web Developer 2005 Express Edition and was actually
considering using IIS until I heard that Apache can serve .aspx files via
mod_mono.  Later I found out that I need 2.0 .NET Framework support which is
limited anyway (a concern if trying to use a project developed by VWD).

I read somewhere (perhaps on mono-project.com) that MonoDevelop can develop
web applications.  So rather than using VWD, I figured I should use
MonoDevelop and be guaranteed 1.1 support.  I downloaded the VMware image
(Mono 1.1.16.1 on SLED 10) and I don't see how to develop my web application
using the widget palette and widget tree (I used a blank MonoDevelop project
and added a Web file).

I did see widgets in a gtk#2.0 project.  Can that be deployed as a web
application to be accessed via browsers?

Can I do visual UI design in MonoDevelop (absolute positioning for a web
form)?  Please advise how?

How does web development on MonoDevelop compare to VWD?

Also, please instruct me how to enable 2.0 .NET support on Ubuntu Dapper.  I
see /usr/lib/xsp/1.0/mod-mono-server.exe running and I suppose I just need
to get the 2.0 server running.

Thanks.
