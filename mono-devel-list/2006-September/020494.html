io-layer.

The problem is the Win32 file API has constructs that Unix doesn't
support, such as mandatory file locking in which one process can lock a
file for writing but permit other processes to read it (or prevent any
attempts to read it).  Unix doesn't have a direct equivalent to this.

Consequently, in order to properly mimic this Win32-ism, Mono needs an
area from which every Mono process has access to implement this locking
scheme, so that files are opened as the .NET program intended, and not
as Unix would normally permit.

There are likely other reasons ~/.wapi is needed, but this is the
biggest one I know of.
