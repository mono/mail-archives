<PRE>Hi there

My company is developing a (non-GUI) product that eventually will need to be 
able to run under both Mono/Linux and MSCLI/Windows.

Currently the development takes place on Windows, using MS VS .net 2005. 
However, we are adding new developers (including me), which are developing in 
a Linux based environment. This means, that we would like to have a build 
environment that is supported both under VSNET05 and Linux/Mono.

Now, I understand that MonoDevelop and prj2make has been able to work with 
VSNET 2003 project files, but will not work with 2005 project files. Are 
there any work taking place to support the newer format?

Alternatively, what soloutions could you recommend in supporting both 
environments from some sort of common build specification at the same time?

I looked at cmake, which have the ability to generate project files for 
VSNET05 and makefiles for Linux from a general specification file, but using 
cmake would require extending it with support for C#.

I also looked briefly at nAnt, which looks good, but the initial comment from 
the Windows developers has been that they feel it lacks integration with 
Visual Studio .net 2005.

Comments on these solutions, general advise, etc, very much welcomed. I 
imagine we are not the only company that has faced this kind of problem?

Regards &amp; thanks in advance,

Mads
