Oops, thanks. I thought my own archive was older than Singularity, but
i was couple of months out. That'll teach me not to trust my memory
;-)

I do think it's important to define exactly why the OS will be written
in C#. If it's just for the sake of using a high-level language, then
one without a runtime would be a much easier choice. Using CIL has got
to involve more work because there's an additional dependency to work
out -- the runtime.

What MS is doing with Singularity make sense because they are
requiring CIL for userland programs, in order to make it verifiable.
They already need a CIL-to-native compiler for that (called 'Bartok'
IIRC), so it's probably not so difficult to adapt it for use in the
kernel. The key piece of technology is a CIL-to-native compiler that
produces code that needs a minimal runtime.
