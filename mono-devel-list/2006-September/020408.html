<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Setting up a web-site where any user may register and do translation 
</I>&gt;<i> work will lower the barrier for doing translation work tremendously. Not 
</I>&gt;<i> only for people NOT having the technical skills needed. This would 
</I>&gt;<i> enable me to contribute some when I have a few left-over minutes, even 
</I>&gt;<i> when I'm nowhere near my own PC. It will also enable the translators to 
</I>&gt;<i> spend all the time focusing on the task at hand (translation) and not 
</I>&gt;<i> having to focus on the technical sides (like CVS/SVN, posting the 
</I>&gt;<i> translations to a mailing-list, ...). ...not that I find those to be 
</I>&gt;<i> complicated or time-consuming tasks, but they someone without technical 
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge would, and I already gave the example of not being near my own PC.
</I>
Yes, a web-based solution might be the best possible solution to lower
the barrier for participation.

In particular, Gnome gets a lot of translations from their existing
community, but we in the Mono world have a couple of problems:

	* We have not chosen a standard translation framework (yes,
	  we need to sort this out) today we have a few different
	  choices: gettext and resources.

	* We have not instrumented for translations most of our own
	  code.

Miguel
