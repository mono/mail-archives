Mono is not C#. See <A HREF="http://mono-project.com/FAQ:_General.">http://mono-project.com/FAQ:_General.</A>

See the FAQ.

See the docs of IList &quot;IList represents a collection of objects that can
be individually accessed by index&quot;.

.NET doesn't distinguish between random access and sequential lists.

</I>
List -&gt; ArrayList
Map -&gt; Hashtable
Set -&gt; Hashtable (or BitArray)

Not to speak about the generics of .NET 2.0 and the C5 framework.

It's a bit late to chime in starting a discussion about collection
design 4 years after .NET has been released. That's usually called
&quot;not-invented-here-syndrome&quot; ;-)
