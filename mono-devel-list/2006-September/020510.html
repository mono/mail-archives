<PRE>As far as the version, the current glib depends on c runtime version
7.0.2600.2180. The newest glib depends on the same one. As the previous
version is working (somehow in VS 2005), I'd assume the newest version would
continue working?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Currently to build mono in VS, one must download a VSDependencies.zip
</I>&gt;<i> that contains required dependencies for building mono. This zip
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;contains an older version of glib, as well as other things. On my
</I>&gt;<i> machine I've upgraded to the latest version of glib on windows &gt;2.9.5
</I>&gt;<i> and done some work to get things building with this. So, how could I get
</I>&gt;<i> this back into the VSDependencies.zip (I assume we &gt;would rather be
</I>&gt;<i> using this newer version of glib)?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is bigger than that, when building with visual studio after
</I>&gt;<i> version 6, it uses a different version of the c runtime, and you can not
</I>&gt;<i> intermingle different versions of this runtime when passing references
</I>&gt;<i> such as file handles between dll's.  Because of this you need to have
</I>&gt;<i> glib (or hopefully eglib soon) built with the same compiler version as
</I>&gt;<i> you are building mono.  Currently there is very poor modern visual
</I>&gt;<i> studio support for glib, although I am sure that would be fairly easy to
</I>&gt;<i> rectify.  The other option would be to have different versions of the
</I>&gt;<i> binary glib files for each of the different runtimes.  (6, 7.0, 7.1, 8
</I>&gt;<i> both release and debug), but this is quite messy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;It seems like the only thing the user really needs to download is the
</I>&gt;<i> latest glib package. The only other thing I think I need from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;VSDependencies is an empty unistd.h file, and a sys directory with a
</I>&gt;<i> time.h and a param.h. The unistd.h is there rather than &gt;#ifdef'ing the
</I>&gt;<i> source code. I don't think there is anything special about the included
</I>&gt;<i> time.h either (I'm wondering if I could just &gt;include the standard
</I>&gt;<i> windows one)? Maybe we could remove the dependency for
</I>&gt;<i> VSDependencies.zip altogether.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Going to a pure VS build will take a few more steps as well, we need to
</I>&gt;<i> generate the bison generated files for monoburg.  For this, I have a
</I>&gt;<i> patch in the works that generates a temp file parser.c.win that can be
</I>&gt;<i> checked into tree, so that people building with msvc don't need to have
</I>&gt;<i> bison to build, this file will need to be re-generated if there are any
</I>&gt;<i> changes to monoburg.y.  Please note, you can not just have a single
</I>&gt;<i> generated parser.c file for windows and unix in tree as the output of
</I>&gt;<i> bison is different for windows and unix.  After that, we need to address
</I>&gt;<i> building the platform specific files that are generated from monoburg.
</I>&gt;<i> This should be fairly easy to generate from different targets in the
</I>&gt;<i> project files.  From this point, it should be fairly easy to build at
</I>&gt;<i> least libmono completely in tree with only visual studio and without
</I>&gt;<i> cygwin.  The tests are a different story, and would have to be handled
</I>&gt;<i> later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The biggest issue in all of this is the glib dependency.  How do we
</I>&gt;<i> address this, do we just use different binary versions, do we focus our
</I>&gt;<i> efforts on getting a clean build of eglib and completing that for
</I>&gt;<i> windows.  I think for the short term, I would be happy to provide glib
</I>&gt;<i> binaries, at least for visual studio 8, for people to use.  The rest of
</I>&gt;<i> the files not related to glib in VSDependencies (such as the other
</I>&gt;<i> header files) should probably just be checked into tree in a separate
</I>&gt;<i> directory that can be included from the project file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Also, I'd like to setup the release target correctly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would agree with that as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, see attached, my first draft of the patches to the monoburg build
</I>&gt;<i> for VS provide for input on the approach used here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks
