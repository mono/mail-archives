<PRE>Hello, Suresh!

Your managed OS idea intrigues me. I have been working on a
Linux-based OS which uses C# solutions for as much of the high-level
(non-OS level) stuff like the boot agent, toolkit, OS tools, etc.
Perhaps that code would be usefuI for your project? I have been
considering doing C# rewrites of UNIX tools too.

In any case, I am very interested in this project and would like to
help/participate.

Kernel and user space code translation shouldn't be all too difficult,
considering mono does just that. Assuming the translated code would
still require a runtime, mono's AOT facilities could handle this.

As for the runtime being managed-- that depends on the ability to
translate the entirety of it's CIL to 100% unmanaged code (without
runtime-support). I'd say this is where the real challenge is.

Yeah, the ability to generate fully-native executable files instead of
shared libraries when invoking AOT compilation... perhaps instead of a
new tool, this change could be implemented as another mono runtime
compilation option like AOT (IE, mono --native or such). This would
minimize the amount of redundant work, and since it would be right in
the runtime, the checks for runtime-dependent code would probably be
easier/complete. It would also provide a way to create unmanaged ELF
executables based on C# software.

Another idea: a subset of C# could be defined so the compiler can
report runtime-dependent code as errors...
