<PRE>I talked to Randy today and he said that Vladimir Vukicevic will be taking
over maintenance for now.

Subject: Re: [Mono-devel-list] OpenGL and Tao?

Judging from recent posts to some forums, Randy seems to be going through a
difficult period.  Burnout, disillusion with project leadership, something
else - I don't know.  Not my business.  The last post I recall suggested he
was looking for someone to take over the project.  In recent days,
taoframework.com redirects to a page on the mono site, suggesting Tao is
being donated/passed on to the Mono Project.  Maybe Tao is to be the
standard OpenGL wrapper for Mono. Not a bad idea since the code lives in
the Mono SVN repository already.  But there hasn't been any official word
on this.  I suspect information on the future of Tao will be forthcoming
eventually, so advise patience.  On the other hand, being in the dark is no
fun either, so if anyone has any info they can share, it would be
appreciated.

Thanks for clearing it up for me.  I'm sorry to hear
about Randy's difficult time, and that Tao is now
maintainerless as a result.  I hope it works out for
him later on in his life.

I'll just use a Gtk# + OpenGL binding like
opengl-sharp or maybe gtkgl# until Mono gains a
standard OpenGL wrapper API.  I would still like to
know if there are plans for a Mono OpenGL namespace or
a standard OpenGL wrapper.  Assuming anyone here can
give guidance on Mono's future path with OpenGL as
either 1st or 3rd teir support.  I personally would
like to see a lower level wrapper, which then is built
upon for a Gtk# OpenGL widget.
