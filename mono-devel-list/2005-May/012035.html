</I>Well Korn&#233;l, you just said the _very_ same thing as I did.  I think
the case rests. Oh and by the way, to help clarify my definition of an
operating system:
&quot;Debian is a free operating system (OS) for your computer. An
operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities that make
your computer run. Debian uses the Linux kernel (the core of an
operating system), but most of the basic OS tools come from the GNU
project; hence the name GNU/Linux.&quot;

Anyway, this conversation is rapidly diverging from its poster's
intent.  What Alejandro proposed is quite possible, and if he wants to
do it, he should be able to try without being told he can't.  I think
it's an interesting project, but I don't know enough about operating
system coding to really contribute.
