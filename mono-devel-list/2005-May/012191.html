No, not today (other than my --version hack, which actually isn't all
that bad).

&gt;<i> &gt; If you want a simpler test, being able to load Mono.Posix via reflection
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be a pretty good one. Much better than depending on an internal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; type like MonoType...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think so. The type used for detection has to be in mscorlib.dll as
</I>&gt;<i> it is the only assembly that is runtime dependent, so each runtime has it's

</I>&gt;<i> internal as public types are used to expose functionality, so they may be
</I>&gt;<i> included later in other runtimes to provide compatibility with the others.
</I>&gt;<i> MonoType is a good choice as has been ther for a long time and it's name is
</I>&gt;<i> specific to Mono so I am sure it will not be used in other runtimes
</I>
Not true *at all*. jonp is write about Mono.Posix, it can probably be
used with other runtimes. However, you can't copy eg system.dll between
runtimes and expect it to work.
