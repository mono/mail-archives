<PRE>Yes, I tried cumulative test runs, etc. I did not get stuck with my idea. 

I was just suggesting something I have seen work successfully before
in a really taxing environment (data base engine development where
millions of SQL queries with a lot network, disk IO and sql
compilation complexity were executed and verified in really short
periods of time)

The benefit of that approach was that the code was always near release
quality with little extra effort/invesment in terms of people or time.
This benefit expands to every future release.

We all have seen/expeirienced the scrambling that goes on when
shipping time nears.

Test/unit of time ratio:

Simple economics: maximize the number of outputs while minimizing the
number of inputs.

Then, this was just a suggestion.
