<PRE>I've been developing a library for License verification using Remoting [and encrypting data that is passed through it before it reaches the remoting boundary] and have found some strange things with the remoting system.

If I throw a bunch of requests at a remoting server it throws a NullReference exception from the RealProxy [I think].
I've wrapped up the functions so they retry if an exception occurs, since I know that the only exception thrown would be the ones related to remoting (since I make sure nothing escapes through remoting).  This has worked, but it makes the situation ugly and unnatural.
I've thrown the stuff at a Windows 2003 system with MS .Net and it runs slower but doesn't crash.
Quite strange in my opinion... as the W2k3 system has 4 CPU's. [Though it was probably in use by a few users at the time]

I'll try to come up with a simple test case using multiple threads [I was generating many new individual processes].
