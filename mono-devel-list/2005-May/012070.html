<PRE>Hi Boris.
  Nice to see that we are trying to get the providebase completed. 
I saw Suresh's reply to the DbParameter.cs class. I guess most of the
comments hold for the DbParameterCollection.cs class also..
If we are writing up code separately and then merging them, I think we
need to be more careful. Even in the previous index redesign checkin we
had many such scenarios(Suresh's comments)  in files. But since we were
merging lot of code we didnt want to burden you guys with additionally
redoing only what is required..

In future, is it possible that mainsoft has the same code as SVN? This
way we would avoid the merge, and the problems emerging out of it..

Also in most parts of the code, you would have noticed that we stick to
guidelines or whatever is used in the file is very close the
guidelines.... Given that we have many people contributing to it, it is
easier to maintain the code if we leave the code style and convention 
in every file the way it is, unless it very bad..
Also note, most of the mono class libraries doesnot use the  &quot;_&quot;
convention for private variables..

Regards
Uma

</I>Hello all
Attached is a proposed patch for ProviderBase that implements some 
additional functionality for provider base classes. It also required me

to made a slight changes in System.Data.Common.
Additional change is adding ExcptionHelper class.

This work done towards move of Mainsoft codebase to SVN.

Please respond with your comments before this patch is committed.

Boris
