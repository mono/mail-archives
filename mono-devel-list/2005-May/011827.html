<PRE>&gt;<i> Even with CAS on Microsoft's .NET, the system isn't
</I>&gt;<i> really geared to running the way you need to on a 
</I>&gt;<i> game server. 
</I>
No, it's not, but with Mono you get a very good
virtual machine that (hopefully) just needs some panel
beating in places to work in a game server.

&gt;<i> In contrast with the Java JVM, the philosphy of .NET
</I>
&gt;<i> isn't one of a virtual machine within
</I>&gt;<i> the machine. Instead .NET is meant to be a layer
</I>&gt;<i> over OS functionality that just makes stuff easier 
</I>&gt;<i> for developers.
</I>
Again, the JVM is a square peg too.

&gt;<i> The practical upshot of this is for example is if
</I>you
&gt;<i> need to schedule lots of code to run concurrently
</I>you
&gt;<i> have to use OS threads. That's OK for a web server
</I>&gt;<i> that might have 10 or maybe 20 ASP.NET apps running
</I>&gt;<i> on it, but if you gave every script on a SecondLife 
</I>&gt;<i> server a seperate thread the machine
</I>&gt;<i> would grind to a halt.  
</I>
Which is why the plan is to inject bytecode to perform
threading in a similar way to the .NET 2 iterators
that Thomas was talking about.

&gt;<i> Likewise .NET doesn't have a
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism that's explicity designed for handling 
</I>&gt;<i> memory allocation.
</I>
Does Java?

&gt;<i> You can do some stuff using the profiler API as 
</I>&gt;<i> you've seen but it's clearly not intended for that 
</I>&gt;<i> use.
</I>
No, but again if it's good enough, then that's OK.

&gt;<i> Also, if you need to inject code into a random
</I>&gt;<i> .NET assembly, you can do that using the profiler
</I>&gt;<i> API (with a lot of additional code of course!), but 
</I>&gt;<i> it's easier and more robust to create
</I>&gt;<i> a modified assembly on disk ahead of time instead.
</I>
Agreed. The solution will probably involve some
bytecode translation of assemblies, some appropriation
of runtime facilities like profiling and (hopefully
not too much) hacking of the runtime and or libraries.

&gt;<i> A lot of stuff in .NET 1.x seems geared to support
</I>&gt;<i> the ASP.NET server which figures as they are
</I>probably
&gt;<i> the most advanced 'customer' of the CLR in that 
</I>&gt;<i> version. 
</I>
I think you're right, but I also think there's enough
good stuff in there that it's worth trying to bend it
a bit to use elsewhere.

&gt;<i> Unless you're a big Microsoft product team though 
</I>&gt;<i> it's probably quite hard to get features added to
</I>the
&gt;<i> .NET CLR :)
</I>
Yes, much easier to make use of the things everyday
folk leave behind :-)

Cheers,

Jim.
