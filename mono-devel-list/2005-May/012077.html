<PRE>Hello Uma,

You are absolutely right: having the same code base is very important. 
We think exactly like you do and all this effort is made in order to 
have the same code base. ProviderBase is the last namespace which we 
merge. Very soon after that we will add our &quot;private&quot; connected mode 
implementation into &quot;.jvm&quot; folders and completely switch our development 
to SVN.

The code styling is a very important issue. Good style just prevents 
bugs and makes development faster and easier. Any notes about bad code 
styling in our patches are welcome and will be fixed immediately.

Regarding the &quot;_&quot; prefix, well, I think omitting it IS a very bad style. 
Just because we already solved bugs (not in System.Data) related to 
misuse of private fields. The fact it's not in use everywhere in mono is 
bad in itself. We strive for better in System.Data, like Suresh said me :-).

In addition, on this occasion I would like to talk about reformatting of 
the code. There are many places where the files are DOS styled, spaces 
used instead of tabs etc. It just makes the maintainance more difficult, 
IDEs driving crazy, diffs and patches not working... I think that if we 
can make one special effort for fixing that, without changing the logic, 
we all will benefit in the long term.

Regards,
Konstantin Triger

</I>&gt;<i>Hello all
</I>&gt;<i>Attached is a proposed patch for ProviderBase that implements some 
</I>&gt;<i>additional functionality for provider base classes. It also required me
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>to made a slight changes in System.Data.Common.
</I>&gt;<i>Additional change is adding ExcptionHelper class.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This work done towards move of Mainsoft codebase to SVN.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Please respond with your comments before this patch is committed.
