I'm not sure I understand it, it just seems that you interpersed
javascript and HTML, what I try to avoid to be able to use a .JS (
that the user will normally reuse from cache what gives better overall
performance)

&gt;<i> The rest of the page is pure HTML...
</I>
That may be the problem...

&gt;<i> The 315Ko page is a test page with more than 100 menu and submenu...
</I>
I developed an ASP system some years ago with some hundreds of menu
items and submenus and by using css and some javascript reformatting
it never exceeded  some 20K. Even my worst page with over 90 input
fields distributed in 5 tabs with full client-side navigation topped
at 100K.

So I think you need to slim-down your HTML. For example why are
calculating sizes at the server-size if with javascript you can truly
know what size things have and adjust their position properly (like
calculating where popup menus or cascaded submenus should appear not
to extend beyond the browser's window).

&gt;<i> The production site will be less than that!
</I>
But it may pose some scalability problems nevertheless, as you will
still be abusing bandwidth and maybe processing time beyond what even
a good intranet infrastructure can handle.

Another thing you may consider: loading the submenus on demand. google
for Ajax.NET for some good ideas about that way of doing things.

Have Fun,
