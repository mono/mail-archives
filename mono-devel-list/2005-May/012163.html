<PRE>Hi Atsushi,

&gt;<i> We don't have &quot;time&quot; data.
</I>If I understand you, &quot;time&quot; can be Now().

&gt;<i> &quot;asserts&quot; are always &quot;1&quot;.
</I>Why is that ? the stand_alone test suite report will have one test with an
assert for each xml test, that can pass or fail.

&gt;<i> There are &quot;known failures&quot; rather than &quot;success&quot;
</I>In this case, Maybe Andrew proposal should remove the &quot;known failures&quot; 
And analyzing the status of the test suite should be done through the NUnit
reports system.
My major goal is to have a unified report system, and not to have a special
report for each stand_alone test suite.
I choose NUnit report because we (mainsoft and mono) already created a
report system for NUnit reports.

Well, then how better is it?

We don't have &quot;time&quot; data.

&quot;asserts&quot; are always &quot;1&quot;.

There are &quot;known failures&quot; rather than &quot;success&quot; which only has
&quot;True&quot; or &quot;False&quot;. It would be mapped to [Category (&quot;NotWorking&quot;)]
which is not reported in our NUnit tests. Or alternatively it
could be mapped to [Ignore], but there are another set of
ignore.lst file which holds tests to be ignored.
