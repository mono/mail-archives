You've both touched on the big issue here: should we
be just running LSL on Mono as a new, faster virtual
machine or look at LSL as just one language and aim
towards running any language which compiles to CIL
within SL?

I've been keeping the former as a fallback position,
but now I'm starting to work on implementing memory
quotas and bytecode threading, which would both be
much easier implemented in the LSL compiler than as
general solutions for any language which targets the
CLR, it would be good to make a decision one way or
the other.

Obviously it's a question we need to decide on, but
I'd like to hear as many opinions from the mono
community as possible. How long is it likely to be
before CAS can be used in anger? Are there any other
issues that would affect going down the multi-language
route?

Cheers,

Jim.
