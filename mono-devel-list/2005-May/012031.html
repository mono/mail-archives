<PRE>I had a brief look around on similar work, such as JNode which is an OS 
written entirely in Java, when I pondered writing an OS like this a 
while back. The only way I can see this being done is that you build the 
kernel in C# with unsafe code, a few extra value types for Interupt 
handling, and a CLR and JIT in managed code. Then to make the thing boot 
you use the JIT compiler to compile both the JIT, CLR and Kernel into 
native code (using highest optimisation settings) and use that as an 
image for GRUB or your own favourite boot loader.

JNode have a good framework for drivers and are working on a graphics 
subsystem  which could be used but I think .NET would be faster as it 
has better access to datatypes and pointers.

I also have some space on sourceforge for it if you would like to use it.
