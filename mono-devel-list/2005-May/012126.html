<PRE> 
Thanks for getting back to me, Daniel.  If you have some time, could you try to work on them.  
 
Also, what is the recommended practice for executing selects and getting result sets from Oracle?  Should the select sql simply be stuffed into the CommandText property of OracleCommand?  Or, is there a way to somehow wrap the selects in stored procs or functions and still get the result sets back?

Hello Micahel,

The status has not changed.  I could try to work on them for you. 
Unless, you want to work on it yourself.  If you want to contribute, I
can help you with it.

In the future, can you email your questions to the mon-list please? 
This will prevent emails from getting lost.

Do I have your permission to email the mono-list this message?

Sincerely,
Daniel
