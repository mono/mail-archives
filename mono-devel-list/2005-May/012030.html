<PRE>It is mostly the work of two men so far, one OS expert and one
compiler expert. They have a C# compiler that creates native code
directly which helps of course. They also use C#'s unsafe mode
(something overlooked by many C# programmers) which is capable of
doing anything you can do in C. They use that for the low-level stuff
(as well as a little C++ and assembler) so you could say that it is
not all &quot;managed code&quot;, but it is nearly all C#.

If you want more info head over to this thread on Channel9
<A HREF="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=68302">http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=68302</A>
where one user who is just as skeptical as Korn&#233;l manages to take up
pages and pages of posts with their complete failure to understand how
an OS written in C# could be possible. There is also an interminable
discussion over what exactly &quot;managed code&quot; means and that really is
the core of the problem because it is a poorly defined term that is
really misapplied with respect to Singularity.
