<PRE>&gt;<i>I am confused: which is your true opinion?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OK, now I understan your problem.
</I>
This is not an opinion. This is only a feedback that I have understood 
Miguel's problem he was speaking of. But I don't means that I have the same 
opinion.

&gt;<i> 2)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It may be improper to assume that there is an internal method called 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> InternalAllocateStr even more improper to assume that strings can be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modified but I don't think that using reflection to access non-public 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> members is improper.
</I>
This is my opinion. And another important opinion is that if we assume that 
our class library assemblies have permission to use unsafe code and P/Invoke 
that are higher privileges we can assume that they have reflection 
permissions as well. If they hasn't got these permissions exceptions will be 
raised but this is true for unsafe code and P/Invoke as well. So if our 
opinion is that we should not depend on permissions we should not use either 
unsafe code or P/Invoke. And I think this is somethig we don't want. But if 
our opinion is that it's OK to require full trust or highly privileged 
permissions at least we can use reflection as well.
