<PRE>Hi Paul,

I've just been trying to install the monodevelop IDE and associated
utilities for FC5 as per your excellent instructions on the mono-develop
mailing list.

However, it seems that the links based upon
<A HREF="http://www.smmp.salford.ac.uk/packages">http://www.smmp.salford.ac.uk/packages</A> have all been discontinued; have
they been located elsewhere?

I have to say that I'm a little disappointed that the FC5 release team
are taking so long to release the monodevelop package as an RPM for
install on FC5. I would have thought that with the current world focus
on C#/.NET it would assume a higher priority than it currently is.

Anyway, any help you could give would be gratefully acknowledged.

Best regards,
Martin Goodrich
