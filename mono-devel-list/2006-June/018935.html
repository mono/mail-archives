Then it is very hard to understand why you posted a revised patch
that just removed reflection stuff. No one would think that you
disagree with Miguel when he or she read that reply.

Anyways it matches my understanding. Now we are ready to revert your
changes depending on the future direction without extra discussion
which might happen, as well as the possibility to add extra reflection
dependency. I don't like such extra dependency though, since it makes
code impossible to reuse or to try on other platforms than existing
mono itself.
