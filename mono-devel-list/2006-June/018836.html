<PRE>Hi,
 
I'm trying to create an application where the object being provided by the server can determine the origin of the client. I've not found any way of doing this apart from using a CallContext specified at the client to contain the client's DNS name.
 
I've made this work with Visual Studio 2005, but keep getting an exception when I try to connect to the server with a Mono client. Ideally, the client will be Mono and the server MS .NET.
 
Has anyone done anything similar and experienced similar problems?
 
The exception is pasted below.
 
Thanks,
 
Simon
