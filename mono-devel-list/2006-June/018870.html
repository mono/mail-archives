Well. I am working on the 2.0 DesignerSurface and DesignerSurfaceManager
(the underlying designerhost and services etc) and in parallel on the
1.1 ComponentDesigner stuff and up (controldesigner, usercontroldesigner
and so on). So it's not an ugly hack what I am planning to achieve. I am
going to implement everything required in System.ComponentModel.Design,
System.ComponentModel, System.Windows.Forms.Design, etc. There is much
work and to be fair I am not a pro in the area, BUT I have printed (and
read) almost every article on the subject. I serously doubt there will
be an easy way to integrate properly a MWF designer in MD. Infact it is
indeed really early to talk about integration of any kind :).
