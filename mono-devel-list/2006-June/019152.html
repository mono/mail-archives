We had similar issues with the remoting stack. We wanted a compact, but 
portable, binary protocol.

What we ended up doing was creating an RPC format that transitioned data in a 
fashion similar to that of the Torque Network Library 
&lt;<A HREF="http://opentnl.sourceforge.net/doxydocs/">http://opentnl.sourceforge.net/doxydocs/</A>&gt;. Data is packed like structures based 
on order and known types in a recursive pass, which makes the codec both fast 
and simple and doesn't require the entire .NET Framework to work.

There are plenty of caveats, though: Your structures must be trees, they have to 
be typed public (although a class trying to marshal itself can easily create a 
marshallable instance, similar to a SerializationInfo instance), and you have to 
know all the types ahead of time. But since you're creating a C++ endpoint as 
well, I'm sure those aren't major setbacks.

I've mulled over open-sourcing that library. Would you be interested?
