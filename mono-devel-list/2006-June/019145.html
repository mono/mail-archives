Your subject says &quot;TCP/IP remoting&quot;, while the body says &quot;TCP/IP
(native .NET binary protocol), so I'll assume you actually mean
Remoting.

You can't use Remoting from a purely unmanaged server, as Remoting
assumes a .NET execution environment (marshaling object references,
object types, class data member names...).  You _might_ be able to fake
enough of the protocol to do it purely unmanaged, but it would likely be
_very_ brittle.

Remoting -- and any other technology which assumes that the same type
can be loaded &amp; used on both sides of the connection -- is not suitable
for cross-runtime uses (e.g. .NET -&gt; Java/C/C++/Python/...).

Which leaves you with looking for something that _is_ useful for
cross-runtime uses, of which there are several:

  - Corba.NET (which uses CORBA as the communications protocol)
  - DBus (if both processes will be on the same machine)
  - SOAP
  - ZeroC/ICE (which you already mentioned)
  - Some home-grown protocol

SOAP is likely to be the most mature, but since it isn't a binary
protocol there may be some concerns about its performance.
