I should have thought of that last night.  Excellent idea.

Following this idea, Mono's gacutil becomes a combination of the normal
.NET gacutil and miguel's mlibconf.  This would certainly simplify
matters, as only one program would be needed instead of two.

As you mention, mono would need to manually load the .libmap files for
assemblies that are not in the GAC.  This is the only sane thing to do
if we wish to preserve &quot;xcopy deployment&quot;; otherwise, the user/installer
would need to manually run gacutil/mlibconf to insert the library
information for the applications non-shared assemblies, which would
greatly complicate moving a private application between systems.
