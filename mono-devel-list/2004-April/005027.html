</I>|<i> The bugs remaining in the corlib test suite (apart from one or two
</I>|<i> culture info changes that will be fixed next week) appear to fall into 4
</I>|<i> main sections:
</I>
This is what I am seeing as well.  Plus I am getting failures because digits
are being grouped into 2 digits instead of 3 (for my en_us culture).

|<i> Suites of test cases are significantly better if they are expected to
</I>|<i> pass, allowing people to see when they have introduced more bugs.
</I>
I agree completely with this and have wanted to get the tests all passing
for quite some time. I think they are most useful at this point as a
regression test bed. Although we have many tests that do not pass, we pretty
much know about them and they are all mostly in bugzilla by now.  It is more
of a priority at this stage of the project to know when we break working
code. The failing tests have a different purpose. I suggest we even [Ignore]
tests that are failing now just so we get a clean run on the tests. Perhaps
wrapped in a #if-#endif so they can be compiled away if one wants to run all
the tests?

|<i> I think that the tests for creation times/opening exceptions should be
</I>|<i> restricted to mono on Windows. That should reduce the number of
</I>|<i> failures.
</I>
Again I agree.  The latest NUnit has some mechanisms for running tests only
on certain platforms, but I haven't had time to try it out.  Do you have
some time for that?
  
Thanks for the analysis,
Nick D.
