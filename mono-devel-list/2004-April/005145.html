<PRE>Hi!

I summarized the current status of corlib in the attached spreadsheet.
My first idea was to see what's really missing for 1.0, since there are
a lot of TODOs that are related to COM or CAS. Finally, I've also added
information about FIXMEs, nunit failures and reported bugs, so we can
have a more complete view of the issues for each class.

The numbers are mainly based on the class status page, although I've
added some TODOs that do not appear there, and it means that there may
be other missing bits that only the class author knows about (I have not
reviewed the code).

There are 356 TODOs+FIXMEs. 153 of those are COM+CAS, which leaves 203
real TODOs. There are also 49 test failures and 21 bugs. 

My feeling is that most of TODOs are easy to fix, and those that are not
might not be really vital for the 1.0 release. However, I don't know the
internals of every class, so probably other people in the team may have
things to say. I think that this spreadsheet can be a good reference
list for everybody.

Hope it is useful,
Lluis.
