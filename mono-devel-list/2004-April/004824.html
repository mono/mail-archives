<PRE>Hello,

   With the arrival of the GAC there are a few changes that we should
probably do, not everything here is cooked, and we need some discussion
about this:

	* .NET 1.2 has been renamed 2.0, we should probably rename
	  NET_1_2 to NET_2_0

	* What should mono's runtime directory contain?

  	  The mono runtime directory contains precompiled assemblies
	  for bootstrapping.   

	  Options include:

		* mono/runtime only contains the basics (mscorlib,
	  	  System, System.dll), the rest goes into a more
	  	  complete package `mono-assemblies'?

		* mono/runtime includes all assemblies we support for
	 	  .NET 1.1 (what we do today), and we find a way
		  of shipping the other runtimes in a different package
	  	  (.NET 1.0 and .NET 2.0)

		* mono/runtime ships with all profiles compiled.

	* We should have code built into mcs/class/lib/$PROFILE since
	  we are now going to support multiple builds.

	* I think we need a single command to build all profiles in
	  a single pass: build 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0 profiles on every build.

	  I do not think it should be the default for development, as it
	  slows things down.

	* Building NET_2_0 is tricky because it requires the generics
	  compiler with a corlib that has generics support.

	  I think we need to &quot;stage&quot; this build: 

		* build .NET 1.1 mcs/mscorlib 

		* use mcs to build mscorlib with &quot;reflection.emit&quot;
	  	  support for generics (mscorlib-genreflection.dll)

		* use mcs and the mscorlib-genreflection.dll to build
	  	  gmcs.

		* use gmcs and mscorlib-genreflection.dll to build the
		  full mscorlib 2.0 that includes the
		  System.Collections.Generics.

	  We should have a full process that bootstraps the NET_2_0
	  profile for sanity purposes. 


Miguel.
