<PRE>i'm just getting started with mono on os x.  i have run into a few 
issues but i'm not familiar with the build system so i won't bother 
posting errors until i understand it a bit more but i wanted to see if 
someone could drop me a few clues about what works/doesn't work with the 
0.31 release and any basic direction, i.e. where can i find more 
information.

my second question is what are people using to develop c# code on os x?  
also how do you handle having the 0.31 release installed but developing 
with the latest from cvs because i would like to use mono to develop 
websites but also possibly do some work on the mono ppc port.

last question, is anyone current working on the os x port of mono?  i am 
definitely interested in getting involved in the project.  thx
