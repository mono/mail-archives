<PRE>Maybe it would be easier to just test if the next instruction started a
BB? Because the call pushes something on to the stack, there would be an
item on the stack at the beginning of the next instruction; Thus, it
would not be possible for a backwards branch to reference that
instruction, meaning we would already have the information available.
Until copyprop is implemented s.t. it can catch the problem, this seems
like a good workaround.

Also, what is the bug with CEE_RET?

Tonight I will add a testcase for the conditions you described to the IL
tests, and add a comment to the code.

When copy propagation is implemented this won't be an issue anyway.

It's not enabled because it produces incorrect code when the instruction
following the call is the start of a new basic block and because
implementing copy propagation will solve this issue (and many more).
To that, you added your own bug with the handling of CEE_RET.

</I>
Maybe you should also start writing your own tests to exercize the
changes you make...
