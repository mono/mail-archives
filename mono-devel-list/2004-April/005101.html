Very interesting! Amazing how a lot of different projects around the world
have got to similar ideas on language/compiler extensibility, my
soon-to-be-released
programming language boo implements very similar features:

&lt;snip&gt;
   class Foo(IDisposable):
      [getter(Disposed)]
      _disposed = false

      def Dispose():
         print('Disposed.')

   using f=Foo():
      print(f.Disposed)
   print(f.Disposed)
&lt;/snip&gt;

The above code contains two examples of the language's extensibility
features:

    * getter is what I call an active attribute (for lack of a better name):
active for the attribute will be instantiated
    during the compilation phase and given a chance to modify the AST;

    * using is a macro; macros in boo are just like active attributes:
classes that will be instantiated during
    compilation and given a chance to process the AST;

The getter attribute would look something like the following:

&lt;snip&gt;
import Boo.Lang.Compiler
import Boo.Lang.Compiler.Ast

class GetterAttribute(AbstractAstAttribute):
    _name as ReferenceExpression

    def constructor([required] name as ReferenceExpression):
         _name = name

    override def Apply([required] node as Node):
         field as Field = node

         property = Property(_name.Name)
         property.Getter = Method(&quot;get&quot;)
         property.Getter.Body.Add(
                  ReturnStatement(
                           ReferenceExpression(field.Name)))

         field.DeclaringType.Members.Add(property)
&lt;/snip&gt;

My hope is that it should be somewhat easy to see what's going on:

    * ReferenceExpression, Node, Property, Method and ReturnStatement are
all AST node classes;

    * the attribute's constructor defines exactly how the attribute should
be used syntax-wise, in this
case, the attribute must be used with a reference, [getter(&quot;Disposed&quot;)]
would be signaled as an error
by the compiler with an apropriate message;

    * the Apply method receives the node to which the attribute was attached
to and can do anything with it; yes,
that's kind of dangerous but I'd rather put the programmers in charge than
trying to protect them from themselves;

&gt;<i> So, any design decision you will make about macros in attributes would be
</I>very
&gt;<i> interesting for me, as I will also implement them in near future.
</I>
I think the main thing is to have a clear and easy API for AST manipulation,
this should give
programmers a enough power.

I'd love to hear your thoughts.

BTW, there's one more extensibility mechanism in boo: custom compilation
pipelines but I'll leave
that for the language docs ;-)

Best regards,
Rodrigo
