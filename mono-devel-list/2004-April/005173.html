</I>We could probably make a good argument that `Until we have X, Mono can't
be used by Y type of people' for any X that we have not implemented.

But, lets take a look at all the things we CAN do. Look at all the
projects that CAN run on Mono, with little to no modification. Do all
those projects need to wait until we can do the `X' that `Y' can't wait
for?

So, in short, if you can't live without SWF. Pretend this release never
happened. When 1.x comes around having a SWF impl, treat it as a 1.0
release. However, if you only need what is in the 1.0 picture, you have
the stability that you need.

Of course, if SWF is important to you, it would be a great area to
contribute in.
