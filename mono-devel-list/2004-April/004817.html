<PRE>Hello all,

I've been working on making Mono run on AIX (PowerPC only at the moment).
I'm using AIX 4.3.3 for now.
Most of the things do compile without specific problems.

So far I've encountered in 2 major issues:
1) aio.h - It seems as if the aio_cb struct is defined a little bit
differnetly and a few things are either missing or have been put in a
different struct, thus, I had to disable aio.h support until I'll get back
to there and figure out how to rewrite that code.

2) IPv6 - sockaddr_in6 is defined differently in AIX. It lacks the scope
field, so currently I'm not sure if the IPv6 support will work at all (at
least when I'm done compiling everything).

There were also a few changes in include files for things that appear in
different .h files, but that's minor changes.

I also have a problem that is keeping me from going further in the porting
process.
For some reason, I'm keep getting stuck in the mono/arch Makefile with the
following error:
gmake[1]: *** No rule to make target `/libmonoarch-ppc`, needed by
`libmonoarch.la`.   Stop.

and I can't figure out what's the problem. I never been that much a fan of
Makefile so I'm pretty sure this is a simple thing that I am missing and I
would apprerciate any help I can get.


I also got a general question. I saw in some of the configuration files that
a defined called _HPUX_SOURCE (or something like that was used). Therefore,
for the AIX code changes I am currently using a define called _AIX_SOURCE.
If there is another convention of names, I would be glad to change it to
what it should look like.


In addition to making things work, I've also updated some of the
configure.in files to accomodate the support for AIX and I would also
appreciate some help in there as well.

Thanks in advance,
Eran
