</I>Atsushi is working on creating a patch for this.

&gt;<i> Will this work?
</I>Yeah, it would go something like this.

&gt;<i> Does such a provider already exist?  If not, is one planned?  If so,
</I>&gt;<i> when?
</I>There are not concrete plans for such a provider.

&gt;<i> Is there an experienced provider
</I>&gt;<i> writer out there willing to share his/her experience or advice?  How
</I>&gt;<i> much of an effort would you estimate writing such a provider to be
</I>&gt;<i> (trivial, small, medium, large, huge)?
</I>Writing a provider like the ecma one is a pretty big task. The current
ecma provider is very deeply tied into the system. Like joshua, I
recommend transforming the c# docs into the monodoc format. This way,
you get new benefits as we add them to the system (eg, formatting fixups
we make, etc). Of course, some features you wont be able to take
advantage of (like the beautiful editing system in MonoDoc which, sadly,
you miss out on).

Going with the approach you are suggesting has a pretty high tendency
towards code duplication, which is never really a good thing.

&gt;<i> Is there a standard for naming providers?  The current provider names
</I>&gt;<i> all seem to be 2-8 characters, all lower case, with no underlines or
</I>&gt;<i> hypens.  Is doccomm okay?
</I>How about cscxml? i have no idea what doccomm is intended to stand for.
