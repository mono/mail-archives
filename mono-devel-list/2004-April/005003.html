<PRE>Let me join this question:

It's known that &quot;mcs&quot; compilation requires a working C# compiler. During mcs
build it compiles a new &quot;mcs.exe&quot; which it uses during the later phases of
the build. I understand that this was needed a long time ago where new mcs
features were introduced daily, but is it really needed now that mcs.exe is
pretty stable and feature complete?

Can't we just go with the simple scheme:

1. Compile mcs.exe and all the libraries using the preinstalled &quot;mcs.exe&quot;.
2. Compile mono/mint with GCC
3. Deploy *.exe, *.dll, &quot;mono&quot; and &quot;mint&quot;

Am I missing something here?

Subject: [Mono-devel-list] CVS Bootstrap


&gt;<i> Miguel asked me to post my thoughts/concerns here related to the current
</I>&gt;<i> situation for bootstrapping a cvs installation of the current mono/mcs
</I>&gt;<i> modules.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My understanding of the current bootstrap procedure is that it involves
</I>&gt;<i> checking out both the mono and mcs modules from cvs and then doing makes
</I>&gt;<i> in several subdirs of the two modules, removing some files from the
</I>&gt;<i> mono/runtime dir, and then doing a make install.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously, this is a bad situation.  I've struggled with this myself,
</I>&gt;<i> and watched others struggle as well.  I believe this is keeping
</I>&gt;<i> potential bugfixers out of our ranks, and will continue to do so until
</I>&gt;<i> we fix it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since I have no answers to offer, I'd like to kick off this thread by
</I>&gt;<i> asking for a discussion of the current procedure.  Help me understand
</I>&gt;<i> want exactly has to be done for me to fresh install a mono/mcs cvs image
</I>&gt;<i> into /opt/mono, assuming I have red-carpet mono packages installed
</I>&gt;<i> already and want to keep them there as a fallback so that I can do my
</I>&gt;<i> primary testing for Gtk# development against released packages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do I have to do, in what order, and why is each step required, and
</I>&gt;<i> why in that order?  What all has to be built before anything is
</I>&gt;<i> installed? What all can't be built until after the initial install?
</I>&gt;<i> What all should be rebuilt after the initial install?  What does the
</I>&gt;<i> procedure look like on my next cvs up?  When do I need to re-bootstrap,
</I>&gt;<i> if ever?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm hoping that a discussion of the dependency issues will help us
</I>&gt;<i> figure out a proper grouping of functionality so that we can have a sane
</I>&gt;<i> bootstrap.  I want to be able to do:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> cvs co first-module;autogen.sh;make;make install;cvs co second-module;
</I>&gt;<i> make...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And have it &quot;Just Work&quot; like every other free software project out
</I>&gt;<i> there.
</I>&gt;<i>
