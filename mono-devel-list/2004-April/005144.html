When copy propagation is implemented this won't be an issue anyway.

It's not enabled because it produces incorrect code when the instruction
following the call is the start of a new basic block and because
implementing copy propagation will solve this issue (and many more).
To that, you added your own bug with the handling of CEE_RET.

Maybe you should also start writing your own tests to exercize the
changes you make...
