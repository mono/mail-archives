It seems to me there is an even better solution: put the mapping file into
the same directory as the assembly that needs it. Then, there is no chance
of filename conflicts. There is already App.exe.config; perhaps a custom
section could be added that Microsoft's code would ignore but which Mono's
code would use to determine the correct version to load? If this isn't
practical, then a separate file could be used -- App.exe.libmap? Obviously,
Microsoft's code would completely ignore this file.
