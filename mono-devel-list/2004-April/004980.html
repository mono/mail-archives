</I>In this example, libfoo is an unmanaged library, so libfoo won't be 
distributing a DLL mapping at all. It seems to me that the scenario the 
conf.d/version scheme is trying to solve is the problem of multiple 
assemblies each doing their own DllImport. So in this case, each 
assembly would install a mapping for itself.

The installation problem is solved by the method proposed by Tom to make 
the filenames insignificant. Special tools would not be needed for 
register/unregister for the assembly-specific mappings, because it is 
just a matter of dropping a file into the conf.d directory.
