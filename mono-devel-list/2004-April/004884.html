<PRE>csdoc will extract the ECMA-style doc comments from the document and create an 
XML representation. csdoc2html and csdoc2latex are some options for creating 
documentation from that XML.

Doxygen allows has some support for embedded comments in C#, although I'm 
investigation this.

(Monodoc is not suitable for authoring documentation for those of us who 
cannot run Gtk#, as far as I can tell. The web interface seems to be 
read-only.)

There are also many people who are very much committed to the doc-comment 
style. I did notice, however, that the Rotor documentation does not use 
doc-comments except for /// &lt;include .... &gt;, so that they are storing their 
comments in some external format as well.
