<PRE>I stop trying to figure out how to build.

Someone has to come forward and describe a step by step procedure on how to
build with the new build system.

Please state ALL your assumptions, and state with a CLEAN cvs tree.

I'm trying now for 2 days to get it going, and can't get it going.

I know stuff is in flux right now, but the procedure should be clear by now,
right?  [I don't have a problem that it fails, but I don't know, if I'm
doing something wrong, or something is broken.  Once I know I'm not doing
something wrong we can fix the stuff that is broken...]
