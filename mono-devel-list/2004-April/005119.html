<PRE>&gt;<i> I'm not sure if I understand why you want to move the check for the
</I>&gt;<i> invariant culture to managed code.  We would have to re-implement
</I>&gt;<i> g_unichar_toupper()/g_unichar_tolower in managed code. We seem to have
</I>&gt;<i> already done that in Char.ToUpper()/Char.ToLower(), however the glib
</I>&gt;<i> implementation seems to take care of some special cases that we don't.
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/glib/glib/guniprop.c?rev=1.33&amp;view=auto">http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/glib/glib/guniprop.c?rev=1.33&amp;view=auto</A>)
</I>
I looked at their implementation and now I understand why my Char.ToXXX
functions are much faster ;)
However I could not find any special cases that glib handles that we do not
(for the invariant case). If you find any, please write which!
So it's all about speed...

&gt;<i> Wouldn't it be safer to use the glib version?  As for the string, it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't seem like we'd be saving anything by doing the invariant culture
</I>&gt;<i> check in managed code.  If we did the Upper/Lower conversion in managed
</I>&gt;<i> code, we'd still have to go to unmanaged code to use the indexer or get
</I>&gt;<i> it as a char[] to do the actual conversion on each character.
</I>
No - you do not have to use unmanaged code for that. However you still need
to Allocate a string, which unfortunatelly needs an internalcall.
(Finding a way to not need the internalcall for constructing a string with
InternalAllocateString would really give the string class a speed boost).

However I attached my current version, which is (only a bit, but measurably)
faster that the internalcall for most cases.
Here are some benchmarks (Probably +- 20 ms):
New version:
huge string with much conversation: 14501ms
huge string with little conversation: 14471ms
small string with much conversation: 1062ms
small string with little conversation: 1071ms

Old version (current CVS):
huge string with much conversation: 16193ms
huge string with little conversation: 14771ms
small string with much conversation: 1141ms
small string with little conversation: 1051ms

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; According to the documentation, String.ToUpper/ToLower and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Char.ToUpper/ToLower should throw an ArgumentNullException if the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; CultureInfo argument is null.  Attached is a patch to do just that.
</I>My
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; only question is if it would have been better to use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; MONO_CHECK_ARG_NULL from object.h.  I wasn't sure if that would abort
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the current function or not.  If if MONO_CHECK_ARG_NULL would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; preferred, I can resubmit.  Either way I would need someone to commit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; this for me as I don't have CVS access.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Thanks.
