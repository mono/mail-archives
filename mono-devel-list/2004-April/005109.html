<PRE>I got Mono to work on Panther by following Griffin Caprio's procedure ( 
<A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/griffincaprio/mono/RunningMonoOnMacOSX.html">http://homepage.mac.com/griffincaprio/mono/RunningMonoOnMacOSX.html</A> ). I 
don't recall running into any problems with it. I did not try building 
it with garbage collection, which I guess is not working? Anyway, I have 
not exactly pushed Mono's feature set, so I am not really in a position 
to comment on how well it works or what is supported, but I have not run 
into any problems yet.

I am not interested per se in producing production quality code, so I 
may be a bad one to answer, but I have used both Mono's and Rotor/Gyro's 
compilers as far as compiling goes. These guys have patches which make 
Rotor and Gyro work more or less on the Mac: <A HREF="http://mondrian-script.org">http://mondrian-script.org</A> 
, though it is still a little finicky and I did not get the debugger to 
work which is, in short, not good. [And by the way, just on technical 
merits alone besides the obvious legal/commercial/political/ethical 
ones, Mono is much nicer than Rotor. Especially on the Macs, where it 
may take a few years for Rotor to compile.]

[You may find this to be useful too, I dunno. For some reason I have not 
gotten csharp mode to work in any of the emacs variants available on 
Mac, but there is a reasonable C# mode for Xcode's editor (blah - I want 
my Emacs) here <A HREF="http://www.druware.com/products/xcodetools.html">http://www.druware.com/products/xcodetools.html</A> .]

I am pretty much new at C# and Mono and Mac OS X (man, I just can't 
win), so perhaps someone who actually knows what they are doing will 
comment
