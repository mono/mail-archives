<PRE>Hi,

Trying to get winelib to work (I've downloaded it from mono cvs). When I
run a winforms c# app, all I get is that /usr/local/lib/winelib.exe.so
cannot be found (it is actually there).

On the monowiki page, it looks like I should apply a patch to the wine
sources, but the sources used were for a 2003 vintage. Is there a more
up to date set of patches anywhere, or should I just be able to
recompile from mono cvs winelib? Currently, when I compile from mono's
cvs winelib, all I get is an error from winebuild saying you can't have
more than one argument on a line (sorry, I can't be more specific, not
at the correct PC atm).

Any help or advice on this would be appreciated.

TTFN

Paul
