<PRE>Hi,

I have a general question regarding Mono's implementation of various
class libraries.

There are more then a few places that Microsoft made some classes
internal that I think (and I'm sure there are a few more people who
think the same) should have been open.

For example (and this is just one example out of many) the class
StateClientManager and its interface IStateClientManager. This class
controls how session objects in ASP.NET are saved, either by saving it
in process, out of process, out of process in a different computer or in
SQL server.

Since this class and interface are internal I cannot implement a
different storage for session state and my only options are to implement
my own HttpModule which will work with all of that and I will have to
supply a specific API (I cannot use HttpContext.Current.Session).

I can persume that Microsoft chose not to publish some of this API since
it might change. But on the other side it seems well baked if you'll
look at it on v1.0, v1.1 and early betas of ASP.NET.


Therefore, my general question is, will some places in Mono will have
great implementation options over Microsoft's .NET and to what extent?

Thanks,
Eran
