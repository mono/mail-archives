<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> I'd like to add support for &quot;Design by Contract&quot; [1] to the Mono C#
</I>&gt;<i> compiler using custom attributes - kind of what eXtensible C# [2] does.
</I>&gt;<i> This requires the dynamic modification of the code tree after the parse
</I>&gt;<i> step of mcs. At the moment there is AFAIK no possibility to extend mcs
</I>&gt;<i> like that without forking it. But it seems that such extensions are
</I>&gt;<i> possible with very little modification of mcs. Specifically that'd be:
</I>&gt;<i> - a hook event after the parse step, probably in MainDriver
</I>&gt;<i> - a public get property for the statements member in the Block class
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps more changes will become necessary but such little modifications
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't hurt. So, my question is now, can I assume that a patch
</I>&gt;<i> integrating these changes would be accepted or are there some
</I>&gt;<i> fundamental issues I've overlooked?
</I>
I could integrate small patches like that.

But in general a fork is not a bad thing;  It is done all the time
everywhere to test, prototype and play with things.  

Once you have a mature patch, maybe we could see what bits we can put in
the mainline compiler, and which ones are not suitable (maybe mcs could
load plugins if necessary).

Miguel
