<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> How do I find where /usr/lib/mono/1.0 is?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I mean mcs.exe looks for directory it is lunched for and assumes that
</I>&gt;<i> there are symlinks to framework assemblies. Now this is no option for me
</I>&gt;<i> in my compiler. Under Microsoft runtime I can simply check for CodeBase
</I>&gt;<i> of mscorlib or System.dll, that are already loaded. However under mono it
</I>&gt;<i> is /usr/lib and gac location (with pubtoken etc). Neither is good for me.
</I>
As you have noticed the new GAC setup has some rough edges still.  There
has been some discussion as to what is the proper way of solving this
problem.

In the next couple of days, we should design a solution for the various
new problems we have.

&gt;<i> Now 1) will be just an option, since it can cause problems when multiple
</I>&gt;<i> libraries are installed. 2) doesn't seem any good. 3) will break binary
</I>&gt;<i> distribution and is ugly. 4) ... I don't even want to think about it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe CodeBase of System.dll could be used to return proper directory, 
</I>&gt;<i> it works somehow under MS.
</I>
This sounds like an option, does this point to the &quot;public&quot; directory
where the assembly lives, or it returns the path from the GAC?

I wonder if Microsoft is using the PATH to locate extra assemblies, and
in that case, what is the right Unixism to apply here.

Miguel
