As far as I know, there is no such thing as libpkg-config. Anyways it would 
bring some strange dependency (maybe optional though) to the compiler.

I think we should simply trust user compiling some program (and that he has 
appropraite priviliges to fail running mcs -pkg &quot;gtk-sharp; rm -fr /&quot;)
