Miguel asked me to look into setting up a tinderbox-like system here for
us to monitor check-ins and also to make sure the tree remains stable.
We have Linux (x86, PPC, Itanium, x86-64), Solaris (Sparc) and Mac OS X
(PPC) machines here and the plan is to set them up to do round-the-clock
builds. We might also want to integrate Sachin's code to run the test
suite as well.

Fawad -- What do I have to do to get this running? Do you have any
patches local to your tree, or should I just download buildbot from SF?

Jaroslaw -- You too seem to a setup. So far, I'm leaning toward
buildbot, because I prefer to use something that's not totally
home-grown, just for the sake of deployment. Have you looked into
buildbot at all? Does your setup offer something that buildbot doesn't
do?

I'm new to all this, so it'll be great if you could bring me up to speed
with what these programs can do and how they need to be deployed. For
me, the most important is the ease of deployment: I'll be setting this
up on six targets, and it's best if the setup procedure is not too
complicated.

Once we reach consensus, I'll go ahead and set it all up. I hope we can
have this running before beta-2 is released (June 1st), sounds good?

thank you so much!

Duncan.
