<PRE>Hi,

as some may know I'm currently optimizing the String class. However I'm
stuck at this point:
Check out the attached benchmark. On my system (x86 Windows) I get the
following results:
Copy using ints: 1302ms
Copy using long: 721ms

Obviously these results are absolute nonsense.
The copy using ints should be at least equally fast as the copy using long
(in fact it should be a little bit faster).
Feel free to try on .Net and you will find out that .Net delivers exactly
the result you would assume that this benchmark delivers (int being slightly
faster than long).

Also the overall speed for this is VERY slow. Compare it to the MS impl.
It's not just a few percent. It's 6x faster.

Somebody really has to look into this!

Andreas
