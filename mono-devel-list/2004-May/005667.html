I built Mono (mcs) again today on Solaris 9 (sparc) with GCC 3.3.2, and had no 
problems. It was simply a matter of typing ./configure and make. There was no 
tweaking required.

Linking a program with -lnsl and -lsocket together on Solaris is the normal 
way to do things, and will not cause any conflicts. Not sure if it makes a 
difference with shared objects (it does when statically linking), but try 
editing the Makefile so that -lnsl appears before -lsocket.

I'm not sure about xnet - can't remember off the top of my head what it 
provides, and it's a bit too late at night to power up the noisy Sparc 5 at 
home to find out :-)
