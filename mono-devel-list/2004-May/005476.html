Oh, that's simple:

	/usr/lib/pkgconfig/gtk+-2.0.pc
	/usr/lib/pkgconfig/gtk+.pc

The same way you can have gtk-sharp and gtk-sharp-2 or whatever.

</I>
Why should you care about prefixes? You just need to know how to call
pkg-config -- and it should simply be in the PATH. Then you can simply
do:

	mcs -pkg:gtk-sharp foo.cs

and that's all.

&gt;<i> I think this

</I>&gt;<i> $prefix/lib/mono/package/blah.dll to the real gac'd assembly, symlink

</I>&gt;<i> files outside of the user requested prefix, and auto* distchecking, and
</I>&gt;<i> that general unix nightmare.
</I>
The symlinks are IMHO needed *only* for system assemblies, as they are
likely to be referenced using just /r: and not /pkg:. I would vote for
the pkg-config to be the only officially supported way of referencing
gtk# and co.
