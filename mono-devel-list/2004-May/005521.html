<PRE>I was just talking to tokugawa on IRC, and he had an interesting problem
with the GAC:

Mono installed from packages, to /usr
Gtk-sharp installed into /usr/local/mono

My understanding is that what should happen in this case is that
somewhere under /usr/local/mono there should be a gtk-sharp directory
populated with symlinks to files somewere under /usr/lib/mono/gac/

What is apparently actually happening is that the canonical gac folder
goes to /usr/local/mono/lib/mono/gac, and there are (incorrect) symlinks
put into /usr/lib somewhere.

It appears to me that this is backwards, and the gacutil code does
actually seem to do this (symlinks in mono's prefix, canonical files in
whatever root was passed in as). What's going on here?
