Yes, you have to tell the compiler which assembly you are compiling
against.  Not just it's name, the physical assembly.  You don't want the
compiler randomly selecting &quot;one with that name&quot; for you, especially
when we get to multiple versions installed.  And adding version,
cultureinfo, and key subfields to a -r isn't any better than a path,
really.

At the very least, it would have to contain -r gtk-sharp -L
/path/to/its/dir.  This has really been required all along, although
most people didn't necessarily feel it since they had Gtk# installed in
the same prefix as mono, and we were just dumping unversioned assemblies
into prefix/lib.  We have to grow up now.  :-)

I think having a single -L path in the --libs output would look better
than having individual paths for each assembly.  I think we're going to
end up with some absurd looking mcs commands spitting out of make the
way we're headed.  But without symlinks or a duplicate assembly
installed in a shared place, we have to fully path to each individual
Gtk# assembly.
