The problem is that we bind a particular version of an API.  In this
case, we bind .so.2, as exposed by gtkhtml-3.0.8.  Since gtkhtml-3.0.10
has apparently *removed* API in order to get its so version up to .4,
somebody would have to actively audit the API to determine if anything
was removed that we are exposing through the binding.

Hence the need to bind a particular so.x version and not autodetect what
version is installed on the machine at build time.

We don't bind much of gtkhtml in gtkhtml-sharp, only like 7 files, so it
may be reasonable to do this.  Although at this point I'm starting to
question whether we should have any non-platform libs in the official
binding, since we can't expect any stability and packaging is going to
be an ongoing nightmare of workaround hacks.
