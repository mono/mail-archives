</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Agreed, this was something that I brought up with jackson a handful of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;days ago (believe it or not), however we decided to see what we could do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;with just gac references.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;The basic issue boils down to this. Having a /usr/lib/net-1.1/ assembly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;that mcs uses to resolve is no problem, ship it in the -devel rpms, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;No issue. The issue comes with something like gtk-sharp.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Do you put the gtk-sharp libraries in net-1.1 and net-2.0, etc, etc?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> only if the gtk-sharp libraries need to be different between 1.1 and 2.0 
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise they can just reside in a gtk-sharp directory. MS only uses 
</I>&gt;<i> the \WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v1.1.4322\ directory for 'system' 
</I>&gt;<i> or 'framework' assemblies - ie those that ship with the base framework. 
</I>&gt;<i> So for mono I guess it comes down to where you draw the boundary of 
</I>&gt;<i> which are the 'core' assemblies. If gtk-sharp is considered to be in 
</I>&gt;<i> this list then it would reside with corlib.dll and friends otherwise it 
</I>&gt;<i> would be somewhere else.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
The are completely separate and shouldnt be stored along side the
framework assemblies. That is a given.

&gt;<i> &gt; If so, that becomes unmanagable really really fast.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;So then you say, OK, 3rd party libraries install their stuff
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;into /usr/lib/LIBRARYNAME-VERSION/ and then somehow tell mcs to probe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;that directory for runtime assemblies.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> why does mcs need to probe ? Just pass 
</I>&gt;<i> \r:/usr/lib/LIBRARYNAME-VERSION.dll or \r:/opt/foo/assemblyname.dll or 
</I>&gt;<i> whatever. gcc doesn't probe to find .h files so why should mcs.exe need 
</I>&gt;<i> to probe to find assembly references ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Well, the idea would be to provide a workable robust solution, obviously
proper usage of pkg-config and PKG_CONFIG_PATH would solve this. But
again, you have no idea how many times those questions are answered all
over. Solving them would be nice ;)

&gt;<i> &gt; To us, that seemed avoidable by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;just resolving mcs references out of the gac. It also seems like a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;better solution in the long term.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> except that now you have to know the public key token in order to 
</I>&gt;<i> generate a file based reference rather than just using a known base 
</I>&gt;<i> path. The other issue is 3rd party compilers ( nemerle, ikvm etc ) that 
</I>&gt;<i> will also have to implement this auto gac probing mechanism to work on mono.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
That is absolutely not true :) But also unimportant.

&gt;<i> &gt;However, if someone can come up with a good 3rd party solution (taking
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;into account different prefixes and all those permissions issues) I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;would love to hear it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Do you mean a solution for 3rd party apps or just an alternative 
</I>&gt;<i> solution to the current setup ?
</I>&gt;<i> If we can agree that storing a seperate copy of assemblies that reside 
</I>&gt;<i> in the gac for the purposes of referencing them is a reasonable thing to 
</I>&gt;<i> do then we'll have made a good start.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I have always felt that it was a good idea, and for the most part have
been attempting to convince myself that its not needed. Jackson and I
touched on this on irc for a bit, and Miguel has also been spoken with
briefly about it.
