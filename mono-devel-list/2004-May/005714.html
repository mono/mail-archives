I agree. It looks like the &quot;ref&quot; flag is being ignored at the method header
(not at the call site). This would explain why the compiler is trying to
convert a &quot;ref T&quot; to a &quot;T&quot;; it thinks the function takes a &quot;T&quot;. I haven't
worked on that part of the code, and I do not have an environment set up to
make changes and test them, but I suspect the plumbing for the &quot;ref&quot; flag
is all in place, and that the fix is likely a one-liner within the parser
itself, before the parse tree hits the compiler proper.
