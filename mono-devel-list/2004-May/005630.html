Now I see why everyone hates MS for always adding proprietary
extensions; glad we're better than them :(

Has anyone ever thought about maintaining not only API compatibility,
but also maintaining a compatibile commandline interface ?  Doesn't
anyone see the importance of that ?

You're really making it very hard to have generic, multi-platform and
multi-framework build files and I really fail to see the motive for that
... unless *nux is the only platform you're interesting in and Windows
is just considered to be a test platform, but I can hardly believe that
(I hope) ... MonoDevelop does run on Windows too, right ?! :(

I hope you understand my concerns ...
