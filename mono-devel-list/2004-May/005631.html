Its still completely possible, the -pkg stuff is a shortcut, we arent
removing /r and /lib dude ;)

How does this break anything for NAnt? because lets get down to brass
tacks dude, last time you brought this up as an issue, it had nothing to
do with anything other than it changing something in NAnt.

As for MonoDevelop, it doesnt, and I have no plans to ever make that
happen on my own.
