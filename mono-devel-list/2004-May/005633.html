well, here is my current thinking.

Load all the .pc files and see which ones have something in Libs: that
ends with .dll (Is this going to be a bad check on some systems?). Then
we will assume anything that has a .pc file is in the gac, so this will
show up in the gac (system, whatever) assemblies tab.

Here is where my thinking gets hazy.

We need to support two uses of said reference. compiling and building.

What would be best is if somehow the 'package' that the third party lib
comes from is included in that .pc file (Your MonoLib tag). (obviously
the mono 'core' stuff will be searched regardless). However MD needs to
figure out how to failover properly without that.
