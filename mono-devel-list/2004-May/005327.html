</I>This is an interesting idea. But, I wonder how frequently GetHashCode is
called on such large strings. I think a useful measurement to make
before investigating a change wrt GetHashCode is to capture data on what
size strings are most frequently used in GetHashCode. MCS is a good
application, but monodoc and any asp.net app probably also make good
examples.

</I>Well, note the `such as'. My point is that it is probably not too hard
to make a benchmark that reads:

for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000000000; i ++)
     &quot;akdsjfalsdkjfa;sldkfja;dlkfjasdlfkjasd;lfkjsad;lfksajdf;lksadjf;&quot;.GetHashCode ();

faster. And I hope that experimentation wrt to such a patch would be
more in-depth than the above example.

</I>
Actually, I do understand the difference :-).

For an Object field, `mutated' would mean the pointer to the object is
changed. Thus, the fields would obviously not be subject to JIT time
evaluation.

However, for a value type, the field values *can* be resolved at jit
time because `mutating' a value type means mutating one of its fields.
The thing that prevents this is that you would need to execute a
`ldsflda' on the initonly field. However, partition III states:
        Note: Using ldsflda to compute the address of a static,
        init-only field and then using the resulting pointer to modify
        that value outside the body of the class initializer may lead to
        unpredictable behavior.

This warning is the same warning appended to the `stsfld' instruction:
        Note: Using stsfld to change the value of a static, init-only
        field outside the body of the class initializer may lead to
        unpredictable behavior.

So, the comment in the test case stands.
