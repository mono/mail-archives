Subject: [Mono-list] New Beta1 Win32 installer


Hola!

I just uploaded a new Win32 installer that fixes lots of problem
encountered in the previous ones:
      * Updated runtime to fix GAC path issues.
      * Generate working .bat for cmd.exe and shell scripts for cygwin.
      * Includes MSVCR70.dll.
      * CVS monop to fix assembly loading errors.

You can download it directly from:

<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/beta1/windows/mono-Beta1-win32-2.exe">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/beta1/windows/mono-Beta1-win32-2.exe</A>

or through the mono download page at:

	<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/download.html">http://www.go-mono.com/download.html</A>

It does not include 2.0 preview compiler and assemblies, but I plan on
doing more Win32 installer releases based on CVS including them.

Special thanks go to Urs Muff for helping me while testing.

Enjoy!

-Gonzalo
