As far as no one having experience with the MS GAC, I dont think you can
presume to know that. Not only are many of the ximian mono developers on
windows all the time, lots of the active contributors have pretty
extensive win32 experience.

I dont see the departure at all personally. If anything you are taking
advantage of some peculiarities of the ms implementation which are
shortcuts to doing the right thing.

Again, you havnt explained why at all you *need* to reference the
assembly via its path. If you know what version you want an
Assembly.Load (&quot;AssemblyName, Version=whatever&quot;) will work exactly as
expected.

And if you *dont* know what version you want, how can you be picky about
what you get back?

I dont believe it is being rushed in at all, however waiting any longer
would have been a bad idea as well.
