<PRE>hi,

since ximian plays a big part in gnome, it would seem that their products 
would be compatible.

gnome terminal (shipping with FC2) does not seem to like UTF-8 unicode text 
that much. it has the habit of printing the preamble characters as spaces, 
which made me think there was something going on in mono. however, i have 
found that even a 'konsole' session does not show the error.

problem was when the mono function [System.IO.StreamWriter.FlushBytes] wrote 
out the preamble, the gnome terminal prints out the encoding byte as a 
space. maybe gnome has some options to enable unicode support, but i couldnt 
find it. maybe something should be done abt it....

but thankfully, it got me started at mono hacking....thank god.

bye all,

kidoman
