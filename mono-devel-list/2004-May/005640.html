</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;/pkg-references&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/csc&gt;

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> csc /r:foo.dll -r:fullpath/gtk-sharp.dll ie nant will do the pkg-config
</I>&gt;<i> lookup to get the file reference.
</I>
Sure, I wasn't saying we can't support these package references for third
party libraries, but we can't do this for system libraries without loosing
portability of build files ...

&gt;<i> I'm pretty sure MonoDevelop is making use of many gnome/linux specific
</I>&gt;<i> features to make it a better dev tool for that platform and I think
</I>&gt;<i> thats a good thing. Portability has never been a design goal as far as
</I>&gt;<i> I'm aware - except with keeping in sync with some of the sharpdevelop
</I>&gt;<i> libraries  -Todd, correct me if I'm wrong.
</I>
I'm sorry if my remarks come across a bit harsh, but that was definitely not
my intention (I clearly indicated that I wasn't criticising) ...

I just think it would've been great to also support MonoDevelop on Windows,
as it would showcase the capabilities of Mono to create true cross-platform
applications.

&gt;<i> &gt;Shouldn't Novell/Ximian be showcasing mono's ability to run applications
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;on all platforms, and frameworks ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;This is no criticism, I just think that would be sending out a better
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;message (to potential Windows developers) ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Gert - don't take this the wrong way but your tone on this stuff has
</I>&gt;<i> been just a tad confrontational. Sure there are issues coming up but
</I>&gt;<i> thats only natural with a system of this complexity.  Compatibility with
</I>&gt;<i> the ms tools is a worthy goal and maybe its the case that callin
</I>&gt;<i> pkg-config inline could be a feasible alternative to adding mcs specific
</I>&gt;<i> compiler flags - however a well reasoned explanation of why thats the
</I>&gt;<i> case is always going to get a better response than &quot;doesn't ximian care
</I>&gt;<i> about compatibility ?&quot; style rants.
</I>
Again, sorry if that's the message I've been sending out ... It wasn't my
intention to rant about this ...

I am concerned about compatibility yes, but I guess in this case its better
to just lay back, and have you guys sort it out....

I'm pretty sure you'll come up with something that'll benefit all of us.

Regards,

Gert
