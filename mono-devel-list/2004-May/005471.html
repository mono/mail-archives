<PRE>I haven't fully followed this discussion, so if I'm reitirating something just 
ignore it. Has anybody considered security issues and things like that? Also 
the configuration features one has as Admin in the .NET Configuration 
Console? I think one shouldn't forget those issues in this discussion.
