Agreed, this was something that I brought up with jackson a handful of
days ago (believe it or not), however we decided to see what we could do
with just gac references.

The basic issue boils down to this. Having a /usr/lib/net-1.1/ assembly
that mcs uses to resolve is no problem, ship it in the -devel rpms, etc.
No issue. The issue comes with something like gtk-sharp.

Do you put the gtk-sharp libraries in net-1.1 and net-2.0, etc, etc?

If so, that becomes unmanagable really really fast.

So then you say, OK, 3rd party libraries install their stuff
into /usr/lib/LIBRARYNAME-VERSION/ and then somehow tell mcs to probe
that directory for runtime assemblies. To us, that seemed avoidable by
just resolving mcs references out of the gac. It also seems like a
better solution in the long term.

However, if someone can come up with a good 3rd party solution (taking
into account different prefixes and all those permissions issues) I
would love to hear it.
