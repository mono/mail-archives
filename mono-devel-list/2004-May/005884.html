<PRE>The *first* char of the string is always dword aligned, but the second one isnt :-).

We should be optimizing the x [c] construct for pointer x. Right now we are not even using a memindex type thing, which should make it MUCH faster.

However, I just realized that there is a better way here. You are trying to eliminate the unmanaged transition here. However, look at the code again: you have to make a transition in order to alloc the string. A better way would be to create a specific icall for this method that did the memcopy as part of the icall. You still have 1 managed/unmanaged round trip, but you get the fast memcopy.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; private unsafe static void CharCopy (char* source, char* destination,
</I>int count)
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is the perf here if things are not dword aligned?
</I>
I think for me thing always were dword aligned. We should ensure that
Strings always get the right alignment in the JIT.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; + while (count &gt;= 16) {
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; + *((int*) destination) = *((int*) source);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; + destination += 2;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; + source += 2;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; + *((int*) destination) = *((int*) source);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; + destination += 2;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; + source += 2;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is probably better to do something like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *((int*) dest + x) = ...
</I>
Did you really test this or are you just guessing?
For me the above solution (although more source code) always produced
superior speed.
However I used the notation *((int*) dest[x]) =...
But this seems to be compiled into same IL.

&gt;<i> To figure out why, take a look at what kind of assembly is generated.
</I>&gt;<i> Probably, it is using a memindex type instruction. So the extra addition
</I>&gt;<i> has no overhead, but it saves you the two add instructions.
</I>
I started this way but now do optimization using mostly microbenchmarks,
because my guesses did at most time not match reallity.
E.g. I think your guess is wrong, because then this *((int*) dest[x])  would
be faster, however it is not...

&gt;<i> Also, I have a patch that I am working on which does an assembly impl of
</I>&gt;<i> String.Equals. I got great perf on it, so maybe we can get something
</I>&gt;<i> similar.
</I>
Oh, I'm working on string for some months now and have a patch which added a
lot of speed to Equals, too. However I didn't look at it for some time and
things got shuffled around a bit with the pointer perf improvements and the
intrinsification of the char offsets in the JIT, so my figures may not be
valid anymore.

Andreas

P.S.
I just tried *((int*) dest + x) = ... to be sure and the perf was
catastrophical
