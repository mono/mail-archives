</I>I'm pretty sure just A:B are meant to determine which version the 
runtime is to load.  Supposedly .NET will load the A:B version with the 
highest C:D (build:revision) number according to the C# book I have.

&quot;When two assemblies have different major or minor numbers, they are 
considered to be incompatible. ... When an application loads an 
assembly, it specifies the major and minor version it wants, and the 
AssemblyResolver finds the highest build and revision numbers.&quot;

Which doesn't explain why they think asking for version 1.2 is ok for 
them to load the 1.0 version of System.Xml on .NET, but perhaps they 
didn't expect anyone to use higher numbers then they did yet.  Perhaps, 
they are actually falling back to load only on the Major version.
