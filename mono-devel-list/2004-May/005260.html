<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> &gt; There is only one runtime as far as I can tell. And the version of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; libraries that mono attempts to use should be based off the corlib
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; version included in your executable, not a config mapping.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure if this means &quot;perfect backward compatibility&quot;, but I may be
</I>&gt;<i> wrong. If I'm right though, it means the dependency hell is likely to arise.
</I>&gt;<i> Remember that the runtime itself can have issues which some applications
</I>&gt;<i> will rely upon which will ultimately break them when the runtime is &quot;fixed&quot;.
</I>
Some Unix ways of dealing with this:

	* Separate prefixes for installation of software.

	* Full virtualization of the operating system (Linux on S390 or
	  the new &quot;Zones&quot; support in Solaris).

Sometimes runtimes are renamed to support older versions:

	/usr/bin/perl4
	/usr/bin/perl &lt;- Perl5

Ie, its not terribly difficult to support, and has been done extensively
in the past.

&gt;<i> GAC is not a filesystem and shouldn't be treaded as such. Ideally the MS
</I>&gt;<i> should have encrypted the contents of &quot;\Windows\assembly\GAC&quot; folder or put
</I>&gt;<i> it into a ZIP file in the past.
</I>
In *our* implementation it is.

&gt;<i> BTW. Under .NET GAC has a special semantics: assemblies from the GAC are
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;shared&quot; among appdomains in a single process. It introduces a performance
</I>&gt;<i> hit when accessing static data but helps in preserving memory since only one
</I>&gt;<i> copy of each routine is JITted. Is mono going to implement this feature? Do
</I>&gt;<i> you think the GAC as it's implemented will fit this idea?
</I>
We already do that (pre GAC days), see the -O=shared optimization flag,
and the LoaderOptimization enum.

This is an independent issue, that we also happen to treat differently.

Miguel.
