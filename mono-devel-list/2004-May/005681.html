Who installs software from source or using some other home-grown methods
under Unix? Only developers. And they are supposed to know what they are doing.

Regular users use rpm/deb, or better yet
red-carpet/apt-get/poldek/whatever. And rpm/deb provides version and
dependency control. There is no easy way to screw this up.

This is not windows messy thing where you have zilions of .exe
installers, each one with own idea of where to put stuff. I guess that
using GAC as such a failsafe place, to prevent users from shooting
themselves in the foot is only a Windows issue.

For me GAC is just a overcomplicated way to get libfoo.so.1 and
libfoo.so.2. But of course complication comes from compatibility here,
so is unavoidable.
