<PRE>&gt;<i> How difficult would it be to add a /link switch to gacutil that does a
</I>&gt;<i> symlink in the gac instead of a copy of the assembly?  If we had this,
</I>&gt;<i> it would be possible to install assemblies into a prefix and link to the
</I>&gt;<i> installed assemblies from the GAC. 
</I>
I think this is not a good idea. If the installed assembly gets replaced
later by new version, the GAC would have link to the wrong assembly.

As far as I know, the purpose of GAC is provide fail-safe way to use
exactly the same version at runtime as was the version at the compile
time. (that's why it includes the version number (and key) as a part of
file path)
