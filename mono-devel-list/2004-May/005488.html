<PRE>You don't have to respond to this, but just thought I would through a
little something in here that may have already been mentioned.

&gt;<i>The problem with that is apparently the gac shouldnt be used to
</I>&gt;<i> reference assemblies at any time but runtime. It is designed to be an
</I>&gt;<i> opaque black box that just works. For right now it is file based, but
</I>&gt;<i> there are no promises in the future.
</I>I don't think this is true. It looks like csc uses it to reference
assemblies for compilation. If you look at the detailed compiler output
for an asp.net error page you see stuff like this:
/R:&quot;c:\windows\assembly\gac\system.enterpriseservices\1.0.5000.0__b03f5f7f11d50a3a\system.enterpriseservices.dll

Noticed the gac directory.


Also, I would like mcs to look at the System assemblies to locate class
library types by default without a -r. For example, on Windows, I don't
have to tell csc to reference System.Data to locate the SqlClient type.
It just finds it.
