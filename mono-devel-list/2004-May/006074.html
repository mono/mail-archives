<PRE>Hello,

   CVS is open again for commits, the packages for Beta2 have been
cooked and we are now testing them on various platforms. 

   Only bug fixes and performance improving changes should go into CVS. 
Before they go into CVS, patches must be approved by a core developer,
so that means that you must post your patch to the mailing lists to be
reviewed, or you should be on IRC and get approval there.

   Not every module nor assembly is subject to these restrictions.  For
example all of the preview code that is not shipping in production mode
can be commited to (gmcs, Windows.Forms, code surrounded by NET_2_0, the
debugger, documentation).

   Documentation is an area that needs work: Class libraries both in the
Microsoft stack and our stack needs to be completed.  You can use
Monodoc to contribute from your desktop.   Also help is required on the
Monkeyguide to complete it and to make sure that it is technically
accurate.

Miguel.

</PRE>
