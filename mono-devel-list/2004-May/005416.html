RPMs are being pushed to the public Red Carpet servers now. There are
packages for the following distributions:
        
        * Red Hat Linux 9
        * Fedora Core Linux 1 [1]
        * SuSE Linux 9
        * SuSE Linux 9.1 [2]
        * SLES 8 [3]

Note 1: For users of the YUM package management tool running Fedora Core
1, there is experimental support for a Mono YUM repository. Please point
YUM to this address to access the repository:

	<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/beta1/fedora-1-i386">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/beta1/fedora-1-i386</A>

Thanks to John Luke for providing the instructions for setting this up.

Note 2: The Gtk# API parser and code generator tool, GAPI, is currently
not available for SuSE 9.1. That's because perl-XML-LibXML cannot be
built on SuSE 9.1. When that is fixed, gtk-sharp-gapi packages will be
made available.

Note 3: Only core functionality is provided on SLES 8. Due to the old X
implementation on SLES 8, the Cairo graphics library cannot be built.
Without Cairo, libgdiplus is also unavailable, both of which are vital
to our System.Drawing implementation (mono-drawing). Even though the
'mono-web-forms' package is provided, it will not properly install
because of missing dependencies. If you would like to use 
mono-web-forms, you should override the dependencies manually. However,
you'll be left with partial functionality of this package. It is for
this same reason that xsp packages are not available at this moment.

The preview packages for Windows Forms (wine and winelib), as well, are
unavailable.

The current functionality available on SLES 8 is sub-optimal, please
check back in the near future for more updates as these problems are
resolved.

That's all for now, 

Duncan.
