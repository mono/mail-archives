So I did find out what was going on. I have Urs' bridge building as a Cocoa
Framework now. 

 

The problem is that libmint doesn't have _environ defined. I still need to
play with that source and determine where to add: 

 

#if defined (__APPLE__) 

#include &lt;crt_externs.h&gt; 

#define environ (* _NSGetEnviron()) 

#endif 

 

The short term fix was to pass the linker this flag: &quot;-undefined
dynamic_lookup&quot; 

 

I'll look at the mono source today and determine where the ifdefs need to
go.

PS: Jordan is a BSD guy he doesn't touch xcode, its got a gui. :-)

Try asking this question on mono-dev list (<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">mono-devel-list at ximian.com</A>) or on


IRC GIMPnet #mono, most hackers are pretty helpful... 

 

Jordan might even know what's going on.

Still no luck on this... I'll keep digging.

You should only need mint for now, since I'm using mono interpreter 

for now, 

to get dependencies you should be able to do: 

pkg-config --libs mint         for linker dependencies 

pkg-config --cflags mint        for compiler dependencies 

 

let me know if you need more info.

Further turning the static library into a apple framework bundle/dylib

that it can be referred to by other projects more easily. (I have NO 

idea 

how to do that). 

 

So I wanted to have a little more success and I am working on this. I 

got it going pretty good, but I am getting this error: 

 

ld: Undefined symbols: 

_environ 

/usr/bin/libtool: internal link edit command failed 

 

I haven't been able to determine why dylib I need. I'm already linking 

against libmono, libmint, and libglib. I've also tried to link against 

libguile and libgc. 

 

Not resolves the error. Do you know what I need to link against?
