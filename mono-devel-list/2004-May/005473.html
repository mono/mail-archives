The truly funny thing is that I (among others) had suggested a solution
similar to this back in October last year, in the &quot;Potential GAC
implementation ideas&quot; thread started by Todd Berman.

See:
<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-devel-list/2003-October/002672.html">http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-devel-list/2003-October/002672.html</A>

Short version: The RPM packages don't place the shared assemblies
directly into the GAC.  Instead, they place them under:

	/usr/share/&lt;project-name&gt;

During RPM install, the post-install script would call gacutil /i, which
would install the assembly into the GAC.  gacutil /i would either create
a symlink from the GAC to the normal location, or create a direct copy;
it doesn't really matter.

At this point, we'd have two copies of the shared assemblies around: the
RPM-managed copy, and the GAC-managed copy.

The only problem is providing a simple mechanism for compilers to
determine the full path to an assembly.  pkg-config could be used here,
as Miguel has suggested.
