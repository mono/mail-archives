</I>Just for the record - the real reason was compatibility with csc.exe. 
Sure its how nant works but only because it calls out to csc.exe and as 
such can only pass:
- fully qualified paths
- assembly file names for those assemblies in the same folder as csc.exe 
( ie system assemblies).  And as Mike pointed out this needs to be the 
file name of the physical assembly not just a partial name - ie 
System.Data.dll rather than System.Data.
