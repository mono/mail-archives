sounds very reasonable. Your knowledge in this area is much greater than 
mine.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Ok which part is untrue ? If a given assembly is located *only* in the 
gac then its path will be somthing like:

$PREFIX/lib/mono/gac/$ASSEMBLYNAME/$VERSION__$PUBTOKEN/$ASSEMBLYNAME. To assemble that path to pass to a compiler you will have to know both version number and public token won't you ? Note that I said 'file based reference' above.

and the nemerle compiler would need to be passed either /r:$PREFIX/lib/mono/gac/$ASSEMBLYNAME/$VERSION__$PUBTOKEN/$ASSEMBLYNAME or else know how to resolve /r:ASSEMBLYNAME.dll to its gac location - as the current mcs.exe is doing. Thats my understanding anyway - I'm totally open to being corrected. 

&gt;&gt;<i>If we can agree that storing a seperate copy of assemblies that reside 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>in the gac for the purposes of referencing them is a reasonable thing to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>do then we'll have made a good start.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I have always felt that it was a good idea, and for the most part have
</I>&gt;<i>been attempting to convince myself that its not needed. Jackson and I
</I>&gt;<i>touched on this on irc for a bit, and Miguel has also been spoken with
</I>&gt;<i>briefly about it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Excellent. That sounds like we agree on the principles and its the 
particular layout ( prefixes and whatnot ) that needs deciding. Not that 
I'm triviallizing the effort that it will take to get it right.
