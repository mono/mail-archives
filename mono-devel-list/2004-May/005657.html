<PRE>Hello Jose,

&gt;<i>I know that there has been a lot of work on the server side implementation
</I>&gt;<i>of SSL.
</I>
Carlos has been doing a great job on server-side SSL. Maybe he can tell us
more exactly what's the current status on this.

However server-side support isn't planned to be used with mod-mono as Apache
already has mature (and faster) SSL support. Some people have voiced
interest to have a SSL enabled XSP but I don't think anyone is working on
that currently.

&gt;<i> Are there any plans for security certification?
</I>
I'm not aware of any (specific) certification for TLS/SSL (maybe a CC PP
exists ?) but cryptographic algorithms can be certified under NIST FIPS
140-2. Is this the kind of certification you had in mind ? or is it
something else (more general) ?

Hi guys!

I just have two simple questions:
When is it expected for us to finally have support for virtual hosts under
mod-mono?

I know that there has been a lot of work on the server side implementation
of SSL. Are there any plans for security certification?

(I believe that apache is a big monster that in most cases is not necessary,
xsp with support for https and a few tricks would do the work. I have seen
before other mono dudes think/asking about this).

Keep up the good work,
Jos&#233; Faria
