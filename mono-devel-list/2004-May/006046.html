I hate to bring this up again, but I'm still having problems with
FreeBSD 5.2.1-RELEASE on a Pentium III processor.  I was hoping to
have more success with Beta 2 now that someone has unbroken the
Boehm-GC port on FreeBSD 5, but I've had no luck so far.

After running

./configure --with-gc=boehm

the configure script couldn't find libgc or the gc headers, which were
in /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include.  So, I made symbolic links
for the headers and libs into /usr/lib and /usr/include, and
./configure completed nicely.  (I know, it's probably a bad idea to
start linking those files to different places, but I could not figure
out how to make configure look in /usr/local... there must be an
environment variable for this, right?)

After ./configure-ing, I ran gmake, which goes into an infinite loop,
printing this:

(...snip...)
gmake[3]: Leaving directory
`/usr/home/will/Downloads/mono-0.93/mono/interpreter'
Making all in mini
gmake[3]: Entering directory `/usr/home/will/Downloads/mono-0.93/mono/mini'

Fatal error 'Cannot create kernel pipe' at line 284 in file
/usr/src/lib/libc_r/uthread/uthread_init.c (errno = 23)
(and on, and on, and on...)

gmake will continue to print this line for as long as I let it, apparently.

Does anyone have any suggestions?  I'm way out of my depth here.
