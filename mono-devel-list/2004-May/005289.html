Not that this really matters, but let me quote Miguel on this : &quot; Let me
start by saying that -we- the Mono team have relatively
little experience with the GAC&quot;

Its not about scoring points here : I just want to make sure you know what
the consequence of these design decisions are...

</I>
Ofocurse, so you're asking users to specify the full qualified assembly name
on the command line ?

meaninng : mcs /r:System.Data, Version=...,Culture=....,PublicKeyToken=...

This definitely is crazy, but even then its better than having your compiler
guess what assemblies you want to reference ...

&gt;<i>

</I>
Ofcourse you need to know what version you want ...

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I really get the impression that the GAC implementation was rushed in

&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I dont believe it is being rushed in at all, however waiting any longer

</I>
My point is : why implement it different from MS ?  Are you really sure that
the Mono implementation of the GAC is better, and easier to manage than the
MS implementation ?  And even if it is : what happened to compatbility ?

And lets not forget : for any other existing .NET tool which works with
assembly references developers will need to specifiy the full path to an
assembly (or the fully qualified assembly name) anyway ...
