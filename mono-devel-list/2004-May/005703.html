<PRE>Hey Lluis,

&gt;<i> The behavior of async calls for proxies changed from .NET 1.0 to 1.1.
</I>&gt;<i> The current implementation behaves like 1.0. 
</I>
I would say that they fixed the bugs but you are correct ;-)
 
&gt;<i> It seems that in 1.1 some functionality that was implemented 
</I>&gt;<i> in RemotingProxy has been moved to RealProxy. I think we 
</I>&gt;<i> should do the same. I don't like checking for RemotingProxy 
</I>&gt;<i> inside RealProxy. It should be independent. For the EndInvoke 
</I>&gt;<i> call there is no problem since it has to do the same for 
</I>&gt;<i> RemotingProxy and custom proxies. 
</I>
I agree, my problem was the difference between the impls but your
suggestion is very good and solves the problem :)

&gt;<i> For BeginInvoke, after the Invoke call, the RealProxy has to 
</I>&gt;<i> know if the call has been completed synchronously (always 
</I>&gt;<i> true for custom proxies, and may be true for RemotingProxy 
</I>&gt;<i> for some specific methods like
</I>&gt;<i> GetType()) or if it is being executed asynchronously. We 
</I>&gt;<i> could use AsyncResult.IsCompleted for this. Thus, the 
</I>&gt;<i> sequence in RealProxy would
</I>&gt;<i> be:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Set AsyncResult.IsCompleted to true.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Call proxy.Invoke()
</I>&gt;<i> 3) if AsyncResult.IsCompleted is still true, call 
</I>&gt;<i> AsyncResult.SyncProcessMessage
</I>&gt;<i> 4) if not, just return.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> RemotingProxy.Invoke would do:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) if the method is GetHashCode or GetType, run it and return
</I>&gt;<i> 2) if not, set IsCompleted to false, execute the message 
</I>&gt;<i> asynchronously and return.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does this make sense?
</I>
Absolutly, solves the problem the same way. I will see if I can get time
this weekend to try to fix the patch up.
 
&gt;<i> (BTW, we should avoid adding new FIXMEs at this time, since 
</I>&gt;<i> mono 1.0 is getting closer ;-)
</I>
True, still not sure how construction of object in the custom proxy case
should be handled.. Maybee we need to flag this as a known bug.... I
will try to find some time to figure out how it should work (and if it's
a issue at all), remember that the bugs we got was due to async calling
not sync ;-)

Cheers,
 Patrik
