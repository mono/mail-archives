</I>Thats true - of course it only becomes an issue if you're using 
pkg-configured libraries on windows with csc.exe. I assume the -pkg flag 
will work fine with mcs on windows.

&gt;<i>Adding support for specifying packages to reference to NAnt will really

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>not necessarily. It would be easy enough to resolve -pkg flags to the 
required -r: value in the nant code itself if the compiler being 
targetted is not mcs.exe. So for a nant build fragment that looks like :

 &lt;csc target=&quot;library&quot; &gt;
    &lt;sources&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/sources&gt;
    &lt;references&gt;
        &lt;includes name=&quot;foo.dll/&gt;
    &lt;/references&gt;
    &lt;pkg-references&gt;
        &lt;includes name=&quot;gtk-sharp-1.0&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/pkg-references&gt;
&lt;/csc&gt;

we would spit out the following commandlines:
for mcs:

mcs ... /r:foo.dll -pkg  gtk-sharp

for csc:

csc /r:foo.dll -r:fullpath/gtk-sharp.dll ie nant will do the pkg-config 
lookup to get the file reference.

note the pkg-references doesn't exist yet - just laying out ideas for now.

&gt;<i>I just don't understand why its such an issue to have the mono system
</I>&gt;<i>assemblies available in both the GAC and a separate directory, 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I'm not clear on this either. Is this the &quot;two copies&quot; problem that 
Miguel mentioned ? What exactly is the full issue - I 've scanned back 
thru the rest of this thread and I can't find a full description.

&gt;&gt;<i>As for MonoDevelop, it doesnt, and I have no plans to ever make that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>happen on my own.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>No, I understand.  And I'm not saying you should, but it does say
</I>&gt;<i>something about the importance of portability lately, no ?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I'm pretty sure MonoDevelop is making use of many gnome/linux specific 
features to make it a better dev tool for that platform and I think 
thats a good thing. Portability has never been a design goal as far as 
I'm aware - except with keeping in sync with some of the sharpdevelop 
libraries  -Todd, correct me if I'm wrong.

&gt;<i>Shouldn't Novell/Ximian be showcasing mono's ability to run applications

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This is no criticism, I just think that would be sending out a better

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Gert - don't take this the wrong way but your tone on this stuff has 
been just a tad confrontational. Sure there are issues coming up but 
thats only natural with a system of this complexity.  Compatibility with 
the ms tools is a worthy goal and maybe its the case that callin 
pkg-config inline could be a feasible alternative to adding mcs specific 
compiler flags - however a well reasoned explanation of why thats the 
case is always going to get a better response than &quot;doesn't ximian care 
about compatibility ?&quot; style rants.
