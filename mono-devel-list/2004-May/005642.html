I guess this is just a quick hack to be used when you compile from command
line. Just to save users typing. I guess there will be no portability
issues when using NAnt (you can simply translate the &lt;pkg-config&gt;
stuff). And for projects using plain Makefiles, my guess is that:
  a) they are not going to be portable to windows for numerous other
     reasons
  b) fixing the makefile to say `pkg-config` instead of -pkg isn't that
     hard (during porting application for windows) in case you are
     dealing with some other unixism from a) as well. And hey! you are
     going to have /bin/sh, pkg-config and such installed anyway...

[...]
&gt;<i> However, allowing users to take advantages of operating system and

</I>&gt;<i> framework-specific build file is not our intention ... 
</I>
Nobody forces anyone to use -pkg. Users willing to retain Windows
compatibility are free to do so. OTOH I personally wouldn't call running
$(CSC) `pkg-config ...` from makefile windows-portability, as it is
going to force windows users to install lots of unix stuff anyway.

And BTW -- as far as I understand the system assemblies are going to be
installed in separate framework directory anyway.
