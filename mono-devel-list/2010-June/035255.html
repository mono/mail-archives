So you're packaging binaries not built from sources, right ?

In the short term (and if you want compatibility with existing mono
versions installed on end users computers) then you should provide a
mono-signed binary.

For the future please open a bug report (bugzilaa.novell.com) and attach
the .dll on it. I'll take a look to see which key is being and how we
could handle this case.

&gt;<i> or put the mono.snk key
</I>&gt;<i> in the package, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea.
</I>
It's not the best - nor is packaging binaries not built from sources ;-)
