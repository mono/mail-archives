<PRE>Hello,


&gt;<i>    1. I build mono from source myself, use only the runtime, and write all
</I>&gt;<i>    of my own bindings to the android SDK.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As long as you ensure that the recipient of the software gets all of the
</I>benefits that the LGPL grants them (they should be able to relink their app,
replace or upgrade Mono for use in your app), you do not need to purchase
any licenses.

Apple is very specific that the LGPL is not allowed on their appstore,
likely due to the restrictions and implicit patent grants that the
redistribution of LGPL or GPL software imposes on Apple.

Google does not seem to address that issue so far, most likely it is not a
problem in that space.    But you would have to ask a lawyer the specifics.
   It does not seem that Google has a problem like Apple has, but there is
some criticism of how they handle copyrighted materials:

<A HREF="http://nanocr.eu/2010/06/27/googles-mismanagement-of-the-android-market/">http://nanocr.eu/2010/06/27/googles-mismanagement-of-the-android-market/</A>

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    1. I build mono from source using Koush's patches and tools (he uses
</I>&gt;<i>    jni4net to facilitate the android/mono bindings, and he wrote his own
</I>&gt;<i>    MonoDevelop add-in).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is the same scenario.
</I>
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    1. I build mono from source myself, and the application is written
</I>&gt;<i>    using Moonlight (assuming android support is added to moonlight). Any other
</I>&gt;<i>    Android SDK bindings I would write myself or use Koush's bindings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Same scenario.
</I>
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    1. I use the official MonoDroid SDK, distribute the application for
</I>&gt;<i>    free, but the app has advertisements for which I receive income.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The MonoDroid SDK contains a commercial license of Mono, plus proprietary
</I>code not found in the open source Mono.


&gt;<i> Also, another question I have is will there be any sort of staggered
</I>&gt;<i> licensing? I'd like to write android apps as a hobby in my spare time - I
</I>&gt;<i> don't expect the apps to draw enough income to buy more than a pizza now and
</I>&gt;<i> then. Will there be a less expensive hobbyist commercial license in the
</I>&gt;<i> $50-$100 range?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
We have not decided on the pricing yet, but it will likely be priced in the
same MonoTouch range.

Miguel.
