They do, but they only try so hard.

For example, the semantics of token evaluation changed from C#1 to C#2
due to generics, e.g. the parsing of 

        F(G&lt;A, B&gt;(7));

In C#1, that would be a call to F(bool, bool) with `G&lt;A` as the first
argument, and `B&gt;7` as the second argument.

In C#2, the semantics are changed so F(T) is looked for, and the generic
method G&lt;A,B&gt;() is invoked with the value 7.

Most of the breaking changes between C#1 and C#2 are of this manner.

There are other breaking changes between C#3 and C#3 SP1, e.g.

        <A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc713578(VS.90">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc713578(VS.90</A>).aspx

Most of these could be argued as &quot;corner cases&quot; where the implementation
didn't meet the spec (e.g. fixing double invocation of 'finally' blocks,
ensuring that 'params' within indexers matches the interface, etc.).

Then there's moving from C#3 to C#4:

        <A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee855831.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee855831.aspx</A>

Most of these are changes due to the new C#4 language features.

&gt;<i>  If that fails, it's basically going to be a choice between
</I>&gt;<i> going back to Java (which I'd rather not do) or back to C++ (which I'd
</I>&gt;<i> really rather not do).
</I>
Java is a stagnant language, which has taken back-compat to such an
excess that improving the language is near impossible (which is likely
why other JVM languages like Scala are increasingly popular).

C++ isn't necessarily any better, either: there are lots of compiler
bugs, non-standardized compiler extensions, and the language itself will
be changing things (e.g. `auto` is being repurposed in C++-1x, thus
changing the semantics of a previously defined (and deprecated)
keyword).

Also, if we take the above C#3 to C#3 SP1 list as a guide, any compiler
fix that is done to better match the spec would be a breaking change,
and when we have compilers &quot;chasing&quot; and/or &quot;leading&quot; the spec (as is
true for most of the C++-1x features), things WILL change to be more
conformant with the spec.

In short, for ANY language which is actually changing (even minimally),
&quot;breakage&quot; is going to be a possible factor. The only languages where
this isn't true is for dead languages which aren't changing anymore (and
arguably aren't being used much anymore because they haven't changed).
