<PRE>Before proceeding with my current plan, I wanted to get any feedback from anyone who may have explored building a mono app that has setuid. My application is mostly managed code, with a few p/invoke calls, but it's been pretty platform agnostic thus far. I need to have setuid privileges on my app, and the best way I have come up with so far is to have a small native app that acts as a host that has setuid on it. I certainly don't want to change the permissions on /usr/bin/mono. Does anyone have any other suggestions?

Thanks
