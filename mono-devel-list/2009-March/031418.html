<PRE>It looks like the NetworkInterface class uses getifaddrs(3) to fetch all addresses associated with an interface. This list is then used to fill in the multicast addresses returned from the IPInterfaceProperes.MulticastAddresses property. This doesn't appear to work and I don't think getifaddrs returns any multicast addresses. I wanted to confirm this with someone else before filing a bug.

It looks like the appropriate thing to do on Linux is to parse /proc/net/igmp. I'm not sure what the equivalent on windows would be.
