<PRE>Nothing appears to be returned from a call to  NetworkInterface.GetIPProperties().MulticastAddresses, when I'm joined to one or more multicast groups.  I confirmed that on Windows using MS.NET that it indeed returns all multicast joins for each interface.

The mono framework appears to be using getifaddrs(3). I don't know whether that's supposed to return multicast info or not. I ran a small test on Linux calling it directly. No multicast addresses where returned. I wanted to confirm this behavior with someone else before filing a bug.

If you run strace on netstat you'll see that it reads /proc/net/igmp.


using System;
using System.Net.NetworkInformation;

namespace McastInfo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args) {
            foreach (NetworkInterface nic in NetworkInterface.GetAllNetworkInterfaces()) {
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;interface: {0}&quot;, nic.Description);
                foreach (MulticastIPAddressInformation mcastInfo in nic.GetIPProperties().MulticastAddresses) {
                    Console.WriteLine(&quot;mcast-addr: {0}&quot;, mcastInfo.Address);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
