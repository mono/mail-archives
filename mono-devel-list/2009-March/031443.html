<PRE>
I noticed your message when I was searching for help with installing mono on
OpenSolaris, snv 109. on my x86_64 system. I had the same initial problem
you described with  &quot;The compiler 'mcs' doesn't appear to be usable.  Trying
the 'monolite' directory.&quot; My solution turned out to be that I had an older
version of mcs in /usr/bin that was not compatible. I renamed it and make
ran past that point okay.
Now I am stuck near the same place you are, getting this:

MCS     [basic] System.Xml.dll
Mono C# compiler version 2.2.0.0
:<i>  System.Xml.dll ../../class/mono.snk
</I>mv: cannot stat `System.Xml.dll': No such file or directory
make[8]: *** [../../class/lib/basic/System.Xml.dll] Error 1
make[8]: Leaving directory
`/export/home/quad/work/mono/mono-2.2/mcs/class/System.XML'
make[7]: *** [do-all] Error 2
 and the compile quits.

If I figure it out I will post here, or if anyone else has any ideas please
let me know.

</I>&gt;<i> community.  I apologize for the lengthy post but I figured that I might as
</I>&gt;<i> well be thorough.&lt;/P&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Background:&lt;BR&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;P&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I have been wrestling with trying to compile various versions of Mono. 
</I>&gt;<i> After a good deal of trouble, I managed to build v2.0.1 on my Solaris 10
</I>&gt;<i> SPARCv9 machine.  It has issues (i.e. bugs in Mono), but I think the build
</I>&gt;<i> itself was successful.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I believe many of my issues have been fixed in later Mono fixes, but thus
</I>&gt;<i> far I have been unable to build Mono v2.2, v126637, and v2.4 RC2.  I'm
</I>&gt;<i> hoping to be able to utilize v2.4 when it's released but if I can't
</I>&gt;<i> compile the RC2,  obviously I'll have an issue when v2.4 becomes official. 
</I>&gt;<i> If it's a bug with me, I could certainly use some help.  If it's a bug in
</I>&gt;<i> Mono, I need some help finding it so hopefully it can be fixed before v2.4
</I>&gt;<i> is released later this month.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I hope to document all the issues and fixes that I've encountered thus far
</I>&gt;<i> - the documentation for building Mono on Solaris is very scattered, but
</I>&gt;<i> I'd hate to conclude mine with &quot;but in the end it doesn't work&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/P&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Problem:&lt;BR&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;P&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 'Configure' succeeds and 'make' gets all the way to where it compiles
</I>&gt;<i> System.dll (with warning 'System.dll build without parts that don't depend
</I>&gt;<i> on: System.Xml.dll'.  I then get &quot;MCS   [basic] System.dll&quot;, and then the
</I>&gt;<i> annoying &quot;GC Warning: Large stack limit(...):  only scanning 8 MB&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> warning.  It's followed by a 'Compilation succeeded - 13 warnings(s)'
</I>&gt;<i> message which tells me that it finished System.dll.  It then tries working
</I>&gt;<i> on System.Xml.dll after doing what looks like some lexer tree reductions
</I>&gt;<i> (messages like 3 rules never reduced, 1 shift-reduce conflict, etc) and
</I>&gt;<i> then the &quot;MCS    [basic] System.Xml.dll&quot; message.  This is the last thing
</I>&gt;<i> I see.  I can wait for over 16 hours and nothing happens, other than
</I>&gt;<i> prstat reporting that 'mono' has used 16+ hours of CPU time.  It gives an
</I>&gt;<i> '.../class/lib/basic/System.Xml.dll]  Error 130' message after I kill it
</I>&gt;<i> but that is just from me interrupting it.  For some reason, the build
</I>&gt;<i> process is either unable to compile System.Xml.dll, or it runs something
</I>&gt;<i> that hangs.  I don't see any 'compilation succeeded' message like with
</I>&gt;<i> System.dll so I assume it's the former.  But it was able to compile
</I>&gt;<i> System.dll so why can't it compile System.Xml.dll?
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/P&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;P&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> As what may be an important side-note, my previous brick wall was with
</I>&gt;<i> build/deps/basic-profile-check.exe.  I was able to get past this issue but
</I>&gt;<i> I think it's probably the same problem as above, or at least related, so I
</I>&gt;<i> thought it best to mention it:  'Configure' succeeds and 'make' gets all
</I>&gt;<i> the way to where it enters the mcs directory.  I get the &quot;The compiler
</I>&gt;<i> 'mcs' doesn't appear to be usable.  Trying the 'monolite' directory.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> message and then it seems to re-try compiling and/or running
</I>&gt;<i> basic-profile-check.exe and I've waiting over 16 hours and nothing else
</I>&gt;<i> happens - it's hung.  When I kill it, it says
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;[build/deps/basic-profile-check.exe]  Error 127&quot;, and then gives an Error
</I>&gt;<i> 130 but that's just from my interrupting it.  For some reason, the build
</I>&gt;<i> process is either unable to compile basic-profile-check.exe or when it
</I>&gt;<i> runs it, it hangs.  My guess is the former.  Either way, if I add my Mono
</I>&gt;<i> v2.0.1 bin directory to my path, it's able to get past this problem - but
</I>&gt;<i> then hangs on System.Xml.dll per above.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/P&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> What Didn't Work:&lt;BR&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;P&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> First, note that my system does not have access to the Internet.  Things
</I>&gt;<i> like 'make get-mono-latest' don't work for me.  Regardless, I now have a
</I>&gt;<i> rather complete GNU bin directory that I've compiled myself, including GCC
</I>&gt;<i> v3.4.3, TAR v1.21, ar, as, grep, ranlib, strip, ld, etc.  I've renamed the
</I>&gt;<i> 'mcs' file native to Solaris to something else.  I've replaced the &quot;-mt&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> option in gthread-2.0.pc with -D_REENTRANT.  I'm including a copy of
</I>&gt;<i> libgdiplus v2.4 that I built, although I understand that's just needed for
</I>&gt;<i> System.Drawing to work.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I've tried including and not including my v2.0.1 bin and lib in my
</I>&gt;<i> environment to no avail.  I've tried various combinations of configure
</I>&gt;<i> options such as these:  --disable-dtrace --with-gc=none
</I>&gt;<i> --with-sigaltstack=no --with-ikvm-native=no --disable-mcs-build.  The
</I>&gt;<i> summary at the end of Configure confirms that these work (i.e. I was
</I>&gt;<i> previously using signaltstack=no...), and &quot;TLS: pthread&quot;, which I believe
</I>&gt;<i> was auto-detected correctly.  I'm using &quot;ulimit -Hs 10240&quot; now but it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't seem to be doing anything.  I've tried using monolite from
</I>&gt;<i> mono-project.org and adding that to my path.  I've even tried letting the
</I>&gt;<i> _tmpinst directory get created and then editing the scripts in it to point
</I>&gt;<i> to my Mono v2.0.1 files instead of the build ones.  I have read that
</I>&gt;<i> others have succeeded on Solaris 10 SPARC, so thus far I've avoid making
</I>&gt;<i> any code changes to the source, but as of this post that's my next step as
</I>&gt;<i> I can't think of any other avenues.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Nothing seems to let me get past this problem - any ideas?
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/P&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
