<PRE>Hello Everyone,

I want to know, whether we have already or in future have plans of
implementing windows azure services( cloud based platform) as part of Mono.
I developed an application with Azure( based on .net 3.5 sp1). It ran
without any issues with MOMA. But when I tried it with Mono develop, it says
the application is not supported. So I assume we have not developed the
apis.
So I thought, it would help the mono and suse community immensely if I try
implementing the APIs with regard to the azure services.

The azure runtime environment seems similar to ASP.net( with the xml config
files).
It would be very helpful, if you could let me know whether this is a viable
project to start working on and please let me know where I can start(
probably some pointers from people who have implemented asp.net kind of func
in to Mono)

Thanks for helping me out.
-Keerthi
