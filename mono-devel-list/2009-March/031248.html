<PRE>Yes, that's what I'm doing. I had an .exe, now I have a native app that does little more than loads and runs my .exe and its main(). But now I need to compile that native app for 4 different platforms.

If you need a native app anyway (which makes sense, for the reasons you
specified) then it might make sense to embed the mono library and start
your managed code using the embedding API:

There are several examples as well:
