<PRE>Hi All,

This is a bit OT for the dev list, but I suspect I'll get
more solid answers based on experience here than elsewhere.

In NUnit, it is now possible to specify the runtime under
which tests should be run. For MS CLRs, I use net-1.0,
net-1.1, net-2.0, etc. For mono, I use mono-1.0 and 
mono-2.0. I took this convention from NAnt.

These tags are used in several text files and also appear
in dropdowns in the GUI.

The problem comes up when I want to indicate that a test
must be run under a particular CLR version, without regard
to whether it's mono, ms .NET or something else. In that
case, I started to use v1.0, etc. but I'm not sure it's
very clear.

Q1: Is this convention confusing? I considered using 
any-1.1, etc. but that looked a bit dumb.

Q2: Do you think net-x.x should be used for the generic
case rather than for Microsoft? If so, what would you
expect to see for Microsoft.

Q3: When the runtime under which a test should execute
(in a project file) would you rather see the vx.x form
or an explicit combo like mono-2.0+net-2.0?

This is something that is quite easy to change - up to
the point where people start using it - so I'd like
to get it right the first time!

Thanks,
Charlie
