<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> To Eric: since Mono developpers did not have access to MS's spec  
</I>&gt;<i> (and didn't
</I>&gt;<i> disassemble any code), only the public members of BCL classes were  
</I>&gt;<i> guaranted
</I>&gt;<i> to be the same - private fields can be whatever the developer  
</I>&gt;<i> wanted. So
</I>&gt;<i> many classes have a binary format 100% compatible between both  
</I>&gt;<i> platforms,
</I>&gt;<i> but some not.
</I>
What happened was that there were enough complains over the years that  
we
renamed and modified some of our internal code to match the private  
fields in
some of the popular classes to be compatible.

But this has not been a full scale exercise.   We have done a few of  
those on a
case-by-case basis.   This means that the types that Robert mentioned  
(ArrayList,
Hashtable) do work, but more sophisticated types do not.


</PRE>
