<PRE>Hello,


&gt;<i> I notice that in mono master [2] cecil has been upgraded some weeks
</I>&gt;<i> ago to current master of cecil, which is version 0.10.0 Beta.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I still would prefer if external libraries are not that hard bundled
</I>&gt;<i> into Mono, at least not delivered in the rpm.
</I>&gt;<i> I am trying to patch the bundled version of Cecil out in my spec file,
</I>&gt;<i> but that is quite strange and does not look nice. I think we should
</I>&gt;<i> aim for the clear and clean way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Internal Mono cecil was upgraded but it's not bundled in term on publicly
available reference. It's only installed into GAC because we need it
to run mono tools.

Previous version 0.9.5 was installed also as a reference which I agree
was a mistake but removing it would be a breaking change.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or should I aim to have two versions of Mono.Cecil on the system?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You can have multiple versions of Cecil installed and as Cecil has
major breaking changes between minor releases it's probably the only
option you are left with.

Marek
