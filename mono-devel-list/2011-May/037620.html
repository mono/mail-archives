<PRE>Hello,

maybe there might be a problem with a optimization in the jump
trampoline code. In the IL code example appended, the main method
creates two threads that start with a method that jumps to a
synchronized method. The final value of the variable &quot;count&quot;
should be 20, but it isn't always so. If you change the jump
instruction to call instruction, the code works as expected. I
tested with Mono 2.6.1, 2.6.7 and 2.10.2 on an x86 machine
running Linux.

In &quot;mono_postprocess_patches()&quot;, the handle to the method is stored
in the hash table &quot;jump_target_hash&quot;. When the synchronized method
(&quot;tolleMethode()&quot;) is jumped to the first time, the magic trampoline
creates a wrapper and returns the address of the wrapper. The first
jump instruction is patched with that address. A later lookup in the
&quot;jump_target_hash&quot; (&quot;mono_jit_compile_method_inner()&quot;, in the scope
of the JIT-compilation of the wrapper) doesn't return pending jump
patches because the method handle of &quot;tolleMethod()&quot; is stored,
instead of the wrapper's handle. So, the second jump instruction
is not patched (if it is JIT-compiled so far).

Even worse: When the wrapper is executed, the method &quot;tolleMethode()&quot;
is JIT-compiled. Then, in &quot;mono_jit_compile_method_inner()&quot;, there
is a hash hit and the second jump instruction is patched with
the method's address instead of her wrapper's one. So, I suggest to
check for a synchronized method in &quot;mono_postprocess_patches()&quot;,
to create a wrapper if needed and to change the patch's target
method to the wrapper. There might be other problems I don't see?


With kind regards,
Martin D&#228;umler
