<PRE>Hi Jonathan,

thank you very much for the answer! Here are a couple of follow-up
questions:

</I>
So to summarize:
- C# / CLI assemblies are itself platform independent
- the pre-compiled AOT ELF binaries are platform dependent (but are not
in wide-spread use and there may be other options where to place them in
the future)
- interfacing native code can be done platform dependent or independent
(see below)

&gt;<i> However, no Linux distribution actually uses AOT-compiled assemblies
</I>&gt;<i> (that I know of, anyway). Hence my quote: the feature is there, but
</I>&gt;<i> it's rarely (never?) used, so using this as a reason to be different

</I>&gt;<i> chasing the perfect at the expense of the good.
</I>
;-)

Just to remove all uncertainties:

Is it the view of the mono developers, that the standard libraries from
the mono project interfacing the native libraries in an
platform-independent way?

If there would be a platform dependency left by accident, would this be
considered a valid bug report?

Would you also agree, that if 3rd party projects use platform-dependent
assemblies this should be treated as a bug which has to be fixed?

&gt;&gt;<i> As far as I know, the C# assemblies are indeed architecture
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> independent (as defined by the CIL standard). There may be some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> corner cases where it is possible to explicitly write
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> arch-dependent code, but these may be treated as bugs in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> projects.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It _is_ possible to have platform specific assemblies. Not because
</I>&gt;<i> the IL is platform specific (as you note), but because of Platform
</I>&gt;<i> Invoke [1], which allows ~direct invocation of native code. Managed

</I>&gt;<i> consider nanosleep(2) [2]:
</I>
Yes, that's aligned with my understanding of the various ways to
interface native code (
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Interop_with_Native_Libraries">http://www.mono-project.com/Interop_with_Native_Libraries</A> ) and their
respective levels of architecture independence.

Best regards,
Christian
