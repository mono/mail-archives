Just a note, from the JVM point of view, all exceptions are unchecked.  The
JVM &quot;has&quot; checked exceptions in the same way that it &quot;has&quot; generics; they
are represented as meta-data in the class file but actually are not used by
the JVM itself.  It is only the compiler that deals with this.  And a lot of
exceptions in the Java are unchecked, the whole &quot;Error&quot; and
&quot;RuntimeException&quot; hierarchy for instance.

How are you planning to solve that problem?
&gt;<i>
</I>
The simple answer is that I'm not--at least not right now.  I am trying to
keep the scope maintainable and as such have explicitly laid out what
minimal set of CLI features that I am supporting in my project proposal.
Now, despite bowing out of implementing such features right now, I have
given such things considerable thought and I have no doubt that most of them
can be implemented--it is the cost of implementation that is probably the
big question.

Let me address you question a little more specifically, it is a good one.

   - Generics will be tough, I hate to cop out and type erase like Java
   does, but that could be one implementation option.
   - Regarding un-managed pointers, there are ways you can emulate this,
   but because of the JVM programming model, it will come at a cost.
      - Others have dealt with this by doing things like paging with
      arrays--NestedVM (IVME '04), does this for the memory model of a
MIPS R2000
      ISA which it emulates.
      - This is not in my radar yet, because I think it would be a
      huge win just to support the verifiable subset of CIL.
Un-managed pointers
      are not in this subset.
   - Regarding managed pointers, I will likely employ a boxing technique
   to do this.  Managed method pointers could be handled by using reflection.
      - These will of course take a performance hit (especially if
      reflection is involved), but at least we can have it.
      - Delegates are classes with methods from the programming model
   point of view  (there are CLI rules with regard to what can be in a
   delegate's definition, however).
      - With regard to the run-time provided method implementations in
      a delegate, one approach could be to actually emit the
implementation of the
      delegate methods.
      - Events and properties are really just meta-data &quot;sugar&quot;, there
   are no CIL instructions associated with them specifically and they look like
   methods in the programming model.
   - Although you didn't list these, here are a couple of other items.
      - I am actually very concerned with &quot;newslot&quot; methods,
      non-virtual instance method calls, and explicit interface method
definition
      for near term future work.  This will undoubtedly be a pain to implement;
      there is a lot of opportunity to make really inefficient implementations.
   - Tail calls will be another really tough thing to implement since the
      JVM programming model does not have native support for tail recursive
      calls.  This is probably not a highly used CLI feature anyhow (Unless you
      are a Scheme compiler), so it is not really on my radar at the moment
      because there are much larger fish to fry before I wrestle with
that.  A lot
      of literature on the subject--some kind of trampolining
implementation may
      be a way to support this.

Here is a link to my proposal--it more clearly defines the scope for the
first phase of this project.

I hate labeling a lot of these items as &quot;future work&quot;, but we have to start
somewhere manageable.  Note that future work is not the same thing as &quot;never
planning on implementing&quot;, so any insight on these issues are always
appreciated.

Regards,
Almann
