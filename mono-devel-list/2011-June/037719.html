</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A continuous integration server for mono is required IMO, so I'm going
</I>&gt;<i> to put out a few options and see what the community thinks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Hosting everything - If the community is most willing to support
</I>&gt;<i> monetarily, the entire build farm can be hosted at any number of
</I>&gt;<i> providers. Someone of course still needs to maintain the CI system, but
</I>&gt;<i> there would be no direct cost for hardware or a physical location for
</I>&gt;<i> the machines (up front or long term). Also, there is the question of
</I>&gt;<i> platforms for which hosting is not readily available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Hosting the CI server - In this case, I envision a hosted CI
</I>&gt;<i> coordinator machine that can manage and collate build/test results. The
</I>&gt;<i> actual build machines could be hosted, or they could be provided by
</I>&gt;<i> community at large and just directed by the coordinator. There's some
</I>&gt;<i> hand waving here, but I think we could remotely execute the builds and
</I>&gt;<i> make the results publicly available on the CI coordinator.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. No hosting - Potentially, the CI system and the build machines could
</I>&gt;<i> be located at some mono friendly organization or company. This obviously
</I>&gt;<i> requires machines and a physical location to house them. Obviously,
</I>&gt;<i> someone needs to maintain the hardware in addition to the CI system itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My suggestion is to host at least the CI server at some provider, and
</I>&gt;<i> potentially host the platforms for which hosting is readily available
</I>&gt;<i> (Windows/Linux x86/amd64). Some platforms/OSs such as ARM, PowerPC,
</I>&gt;<i> XBOX, PS3, etc. may not be possible to host. I'm guessing orgs with the
</I>&gt;<i> most interest in those platforms will help in maintaining those
</I>&gt;<i> platforms, or help in providing machines that can be used.
</I>
Option #2 seems sensible to me. The committers need control over the 
infrastructure, but the do not need to take care for each and every system.

&gt;<i> Further, I'd suggest using as much 'off the shelf' software as possible
</I>&gt;<i> to allow mono community to focus more on mono and less on build
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure. Unless we need a custom CI system, I propose we at least
</I>&gt;<i> consider TeamCity. A number of contributors to mono use it internally
</I>&gt;<i> with success.
</I>
Is there a reason not to continue using monkeywrench? Perhaps enhanced 
with a little bit of gerrit?

&gt;<i> 1. Any estimates on how much money mono community could collect yearly
</I>&gt;<i> for hosting costs/etc?
</I>
Potent build-hosts in &quot;the cloud&quot; can be had for 50&#8364;/month. I cannot 
imagine that money will be a problem.

&gt;<i> 2. What platforms *require* CI support? Is there an order of importance
</I>&gt;<i> for platform to integrate into CI system?
</I>
I guess platforms should be integrated as they become available. The 
more interesting question is which failures are deemed critical by the 
committers ;-)

&gt;<i> 3. How/Where will *official* releases be built? How/where do we expect
</I>&gt;<i> those binaries to be hosted?
</I>
I'm particularly partial to &quot;native&quot; repositories. yum/apt/ppa repos 
really reduce the friction to get code out to people to test stuff. Of 
course my opinion is heavily biased towards server usage.
