Very nice, thank you!

Distributions are usually not amused when they have to
compile against binary BLOBS distributed with source code.

This means that they'd probably take sdb-cli out of the build
because it's too much work for them to figure out a source-only
build for these binary components.

I did not look at the source, but is there a really compelling
reason other than comfort to support expressions (NRefactory)
and MD's Mono.Debugging.Soft (better abstraction)?
Is conditional compilation an option?
