<PRE>Hi, I googled &quot;Mono on WinCE&quot; and found roughly nothing.

I've done some benchmarks and found that the .NET Compact Framework
3.5 has terrible performance, 3x to 11x slower than native (VC++)
code. In contrast, I found that &quot;real&quot; .NET (x86) has performance
similar to VC++, and Mono is between 50-100% as fast as .NET and C++
native code, depending on the task it is given. (With one bonus: Mono
is twice as fast as .NET for P/Invoke calls.)

So I have three questions.
1. How fast is Mono-for-ARM compared with C++, with Mono for x86 or
with Compact Framework?
2. How hard would it be to port Mono for ARM to WinCE?
3. What work would be involved in doing the port?

P.S. What impact do the layoffs at Attachmate have on Mono and the
Mono web site and mailing list? I'm amazed that there is no news about
it on the web site (which still shows the Novell logo).
