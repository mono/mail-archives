<PRE>Hi,

There are two reasons I chose to use Mono.Debugging:

1) Expression evaluation.
2) Nicer interface for VM events (all the socket stuff is abstracted away).

I consider the first the most important, personally, and I don't think
there's any other (efficient) way to feature expression evaluation.
Expression evaluation is absolutely crucial, especially with a command
line debugger (where you don't have pretty type visualizers), so it
needs to be there in one form or another.

I'm also currently looking into adding ICSharpCode.Decompiler as a
dependency, which would undoubtedly add to the friction... The reason
for this is to allow decompiling assemblies for which there is no
source code, and (hopefully) support debugging (breakpoints, etc) in
the future.

Overall, it'll probably be hard to ship sdb-cli with Linux distros,
but what about the Mac packages?

Regards,
Alex
