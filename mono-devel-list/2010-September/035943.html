Hi All,

I've been having quite a hard time getting a nice, working build, but I
don't want to give up because I really want to use mono as a scripting
engine for a game engine I'm making. Some time ago I checked out the trunk
(pre 2.6.7 release, but it must have been close to it) and got a working
build out of that, however the call to unbox a value type would fail (access
violation). So, I decided to get the 2.6.7 branch, which took me a while to
get the msvc solution building, and now I can't even call
mono_runtime_invoke - it gives me a stack overflow.

So, I think in all the messing around trying to get it to build I've somehow
mixed versions, or built some of the wrong stuff in, and I'm got to ditch
the sources and get a clean set and try a cygwin build. The catch is that
I'm trying to do a 64-bit build. So my question is in two parts:

1) Is  <A HREF="http://mono-project.com/Compiling_Mono_on_Windows">http://mono-project.com/Compiling_Mono_on_Windows</A> this  tutorial
still valid, and
2) What do I have to change to get a 64bit build of the runtime including
eglib.lib, libgc.lib, libmono.lib etc and mono.dll

Thanks,

Guy Sherman.
