The ManagedInstallerClass is scarcely documented in MSDN (unlike the other classes in the System.Configuration.Install namespace).  Also, the description states that the class is not meant to be directly used by one's code.  I don't know much about this ManagedInstallerClass other than it doesn't seem to fit with the model established by the Installer class.  It doesn't derive from Installer.  It implements IManagedInstaller, an interface I don't know much about.

I am familiar with the Installer class that derives from Component and is meant to be subclassed.  The AssemblyInstaller class seems to be the class to use if one wants to programmatically install and uninstall .NET components (without having to execute shell commands to instalutil).  I do this in Windows.

If nobody has any objections I would like to submit a patch that implements the AssemblyInstaller class.

I don't know much about these classes, but my impression was that
ManagedInstallerClass corresponds most directly to installutil.exe,
but that that class must use AssemblyInstaller. It seems installutil
duplicates some functionality of both of those, and it should probably
call on them instead.
