There has been a tonne of activity at GitHub related to MonoMac for both
Mono and MonoDevelop. There has been a lot of XCode4 integration stuff for
example.

I suspect that this is being driven mostly by Xamarin's upcoming MonoTouch
killer. They must be using MacCore to share code between MonoMac and Xamarin
for iOS just like Novell did. Not a big surprise.

If the Xamarin iOS product will support iOS 5 and XCode4 (which I suspect it
will) then it will be immediately be superior to MonoTouch. This should give
it a leg up on being a commercial success as I am sure anybody using
MonoTouch for real will want to upgrade.

So, MonoMac is definitely being helped by Xamarin at this point. It is not a
product for them though and so I imagine it will not be a priority directly.
The community will no doubt have to jump in at least a certain amount to
keep MonoMac strong.

Mono itself is in the same boat but non-Xamarin contributors do seem to be
jumping on board. It is good to see the ecosystem diversify.
