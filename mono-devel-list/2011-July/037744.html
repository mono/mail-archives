<PRE>Hello,

I have developped a WinForm test application in C# on Windows where it works
fine.
However, I'm trying to port it under Mac OS, almost everything is ok but I
still have a major issue : sometimes, my threads go to sleep and never wake
up...

My main thread is a WinForm displaying tests commands to select and run.
When running a test, I make a thread with a loop performing operations,
sleeping for 10ms between them.
Sometimes, my test runs just fine but, from times to times, my thread is
stuck in the sleep !

When I step with the debugger, I pass on the sleep instruction and then
nothing.
When I &quot;Pause&quot; the program, the Threads debug window tells me I'm in the
sleep instruction.
When I put a breakpoint in my test loop, I hit it once or twice and then no
more, without catching any exception.
My logs tell me the same.

I've spend quite a few hours on this tried many things (checking with empty
test loops, deactivating some graphical components, some events...) without
solving anything and now, I'm as stuck as my threads :-(

Any help would be much appreciated, I can answer questions quickly if I
failed to mention something important.

Thank you in advance,

Chris.
