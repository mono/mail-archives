So GCC lets you take the address of a... label? :)

That would work, too.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Looking at mono_jit_init(), it would be very easy to add a
</I>&gt;<i> mono_jit_is_initialized() function, by simply setting a flag in mono itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think I remember seeing a discussion about multiple invocations of

</I>
I believe it was about non-interleaved mono_jit_init() and 
mono_jit_cleanup() sequences. The latter is still unable to clean
up properly. An interleaved mono_jit_init() is something that will
probably never work, apart from a trivial implementation that
does nothing when interleaved.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> * Think about multi-threading, and how to invoke mono_thread_attach.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IIRC, when I wrote the thunk support, I've reused a method
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wrapper type that already performs mono_thread_attach()
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on managed/unmanaged boundaries. I even wanted to introduce a

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting!  That's quite clever actually - calling attach when actually
</I>&gt;<i> calling into the runtime via a thunk, from a thread that hasn't been
</I>&gt;<i> attached.  Let me know your thoughts on getting rid of mono_thread_attach().
</I>
Do you mean getting rid of mono_thread_attach() from the current
thunk implementation? I'm afraid it's too late for this, because
the thunks became a public API.
