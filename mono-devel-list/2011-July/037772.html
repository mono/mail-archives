<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hello folks,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Some of you have been asking about the upcoming release of Mono 2.12.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   We hit a little bit of a bump in the road with the layoff of the Mono
</I>&gt;<i> team, but we have now re-constituted the team at Xamarin and we are getting
</I>&gt;<i> back to speed.  Our first priority at Xamarin is to ensure that our amazing
</I>&gt;<i> team of hackers remains employed, so we are focused on creating amazing
</I>&gt;<i> products for the mobile space.   Of course, our products are entirely based
</I>&gt;<i> on Mono, and as you can see from the commits to the various Mono modules, a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of our energy goes into improving Mono.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   To get the 2.12 release to your hands, here?s what we still need to do:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (a) We need to be able to build packages
</I>&gt;<i> (b) We need to be able to host the software
</I>&gt;<i> (c) We need to adopt the branching and release procedures.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   During the transition to Xamarin, we lost our build engineer. But luckily
</I>&gt;<i> at Xamarin we?ve hired Alex Corrado, a very talented developer who?s
</I>&gt;<i> created
</I>&gt;<i> a new build system for Mono.  The good news is that we are making progress
</I>&gt;<i> and we are now able to build Linux and MacOS packages.   Next, Alex is
</I>&gt;<i> working on Windows builds.  We are not there yet, but we will be there in
</I>&gt;<i> the next couple of weeks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Once we have packages, we will setup a new website for the Mono project
</I>&gt;<i> where we can host the software and the other project resources, like a
</I>&gt;<i> wiki,
</I>&gt;<i> forums, etc.  So we are working on a separate domain to host both a Mono
</I>&gt;<i> web
</I>&gt;<i> site and the software, and that should be up in the next week or two.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Once we have something ready, we will share the information with the rest
</I>&gt;<i> of the world and give access to the new Wiki to the various maintainers to
</I>&gt;<i> help us keep the content up to date.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your patience and your love for Mono!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Miguel
</I>

Maybe this is a good chance to dump the cygwin stuff and switch to Mingw-w64
and MSys (as native toolchain for Windows).
It is possible to build mono in 32 and 64bit with it - some people lurking
around at this list have done it (including me).

Best,
Frank
