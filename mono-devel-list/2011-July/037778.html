<PRE>As I understand it, Mono on Windows does support running mixed-mode
assemblies.

My guess is the primary reason for not supporting it on other platforms
has more to do with the hassle of developing a C++/CLI compiler than
concerns about cross-platform compatibility.


A long time ago, there was a mention on twitter of C++/CLI support being
added to Clang (<A HREF="https://twitter.com/#!/atoker/status/5830794151">https://twitter.com/#!/atoker/status/5830794151</A>), but I've
not seen anything about it since then.

Personally, I'd love to see C++/CLI and mixed-mode assembly support, as it
would allow us to eliminate a lot of code (our Windows product uses
C++/CLI for part of the product, while Mac goes the P/Invoke route with a
lot of error-prone code duplication along the way).

However, I expect to find myself in the minority on this issue; I'm sure
there are many more issues to be addressed that would help a much greater
number of Mono users.

</I>&gt;<i>logic applies. That also means that the resulting assembly will be of
</I>&gt;<i>little

</I>&gt;<i>an appropriate version of the same native library available. In either

</I>&gt;<i>a mixed-mode assembly to work cross platform than I would a native
</I>&gt;<i>executable. Listing such as the reason to leave out this functionality
</I>&gt;<i>denies the very reason why it was included in Microsoft's implementation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Without a doubt, every case where I've wanted/needed to use C++.NET has
</I>&gt;<i>been
</I>&gt;<i>to create a mixed mode assembly with the intent of creating a clean,
</I>&gt;<i>optimized .NET interface for some piece of unmanaged code. If P/Invoke and
</I>&gt;<i>System.Runtime.InteropServices formed a complete solution for importing
</I>&gt;<i>native functionality into .NET, then I doubt Microsoft would have bothered
</I>&gt;<i>allowing for mixed-mode assemblies at all. However, there are a great many
</I>&gt;<i>things that cannot be cleanly handled using P/Invoke when it comes to
</I>&gt;<i>importing library functionality. One such case I encountered was a library
</I>&gt;<i>with functions that returned char* containing buffered data if it existed,
</I>&gt;<i>NULL if no data existed, or -1 on error. With C++.NET, I separated the
</I>&gt;<i>single return value into a return code and an out parameter, relieving me
</I>&gt;<i>of
</I>&gt;<i>the need to convert IntPtr's into 2 different things on the .NET side. I'm
</I>&gt;<i>not claiming that this couldn't have been done without mixed-mode, but I
</I>&gt;<i>am
</I>&gt;<i>saying that the mixed mode-solution was superior. Things become even more
</I>&gt;<i>interesting when the parameter list of the native function includes either
</I>&gt;<i>(...) or (va_list). While .NET's params keyword helps, there's often a
</I>&gt;<i>much
</I>&gt;<i>more elegant solution that can be devised using mixed-mode code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Put in short, P/Invoke is just fine for importing a few functions every
</I>&gt;<i>now
</I>&gt;<i>and again, but when a native library of code needs to be exposed, nothing
</I>&gt;<i>beats mixed mode using C++.NET. The absence of this functionality from
</I>&gt;<i>mono
</I>&gt;<i>is an oversight that most certainly should be corrected.
