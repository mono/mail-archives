<PRE>Sorry for the late answer, I had to work on another urgent matter this
morning.

@Tom:
I've just run tests with all the UI updates disabled and I still have the
problem so I think this trail can be discarded.
Just for the record, it was first on Application.Idle but, as it was
sometimes laggy, I had changed it to a Timer.Tick, I had forgotten about
this.

@Denis:
I had events a the very beginning of my project on Windows, instead of
sleeping, I had a Semaphore.WaitOne but I had problems with this solution.
However, it was like 2 years ago and I can't recall what these were exactly.
Yet, I'm gonna retry that now on Mono see how it goes, I'll keep you
informed.
