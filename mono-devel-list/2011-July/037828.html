<PRE>Sorry, my question was not explicit enough.
Here is my problem:
I have written a WCF service, running as a console application.
This service is supposed to be connected to the internet, so it may be exposed to all kind of garbage traffic, or even attacks, and should never crash.
As it is, the mono framework throws an exception, and the program stops, whenever anything comes in that mono does not understand.
I can't / don't know how to catch these exceptions in my code.
Is there a way to make the program run in a stable way?
