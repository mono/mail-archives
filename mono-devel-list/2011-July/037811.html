That would be nice and easy if the linker supported adding arbitrary
sections. Then we'd just need a tool to extract the CLI parts from the
PE file and create a binary blob that could be passed off to the
linker. We would also need a way to generate native stubs that would
load and initialize the mono runtime and a way to expose the managed
API as native entry points. Since the CLI is OO, it would make sense
to expose the managed API in a way that would be consumable from some
native object system, like C++, Obj-C, or GObject.

Would this really be necessary? Wouldn't it be cleaner if the
ELF/Mach-o binary just linked with libMono and we exposed a native
entry point that would use the Mono embedding APIs to call the managed
Main method?

This does, indeed sound like quite an interesting exercise.

Best,
