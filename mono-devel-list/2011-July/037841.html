Brilliant!  Just an entry in the string table, and a symbol pointing to it
should do.  Bit of linker script magic will probably help here.

Well, I went ahead and did it before I got your reply... Let me know what
you think.  It's most certainly non-portable, which is a /bad thing/.


&gt;<i> &gt; * Think about multiple loaded assemblies, and the impact that will have

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe we should propose a mono_jit_is_initialized() for libmono,

</I>
Yes - this is a good idea.  I'm also wondering if the support library should
actually be linked in as a shared library, in which case it can simply hold
a flag about whether or not the JIT has been loaded.

Looking at mono_jit_init(), it would be very easy to add a
mono_jit_is_initialized() function, by simply setting a flag in mono itself.

I think I remember seeing a discussion about multiple invocations of
mono_jit_init() somewhere - was there ever a resolution to that?


&gt;<i> &gt; * Think about multi-threading, and how to invoke mono_thread_attach.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IIRC, when I wrote the thunk support, I've reused a method
</I>&gt;<i> wrapper type that already performs mono_thread_attach()
</I>&gt;<i> on managed/unmanaged boundaries. I even wanted to introduce a
</I>&gt;<i> new wrapper type to get rid of mono_thread_attach() for performance
</I>&gt;<i> reasons, but never did it.
</I>

Interesting!  That's quite clever actually - calling attach when actually
calling into the runtime via a thunk, from a thread that hasn't been
attached.  Let me know your thoughts on getting rid of mono_thread_attach().
