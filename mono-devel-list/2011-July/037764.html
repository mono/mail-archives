<PRE>Hello folks,

   Some of you have been asking about the upcoming release of Mono 2.12.

   We hit a little bit of a bump in the road with the layoff of the Mono
team, but we have now re-constituted the team at Xamarin and we are getting
back to speed.  Our first priority at Xamarin is to ensure that our amazing
team of hackers remains employed, so we are focused on creating amazing
products for the mobile space.   Of course, our products are entirely based
on Mono, and as you can see from the commits to the various Mono modules, a
lot of our energy goes into improving Mono.

   To get the 2.12 release to your hands, here&#8217;s what we still need to do:

(a) We need to be able to build packages
(b) We need to be able to host the software
(c) We need to adopt the branching and release procedures.

   During the transition to Xamarin, we lost our build engineer. But luckily
at Xamarin we&#8217;ve hired Alex Corrado, a very talented developer who&#8217;s created
a new build system for Mono.  The good news is that we are making progress
and we are now able to build Linux and MacOS packages.   Next, Alex is
working on Windows builds.  We are not there yet, but we will be there in
the next couple of weeks.

   Once we have packages, we will setup a new website for the Mono project
where we can host the software and the other project resources, like a wiki,
forums, etc.  So we are working on a separate domain to host both a Mono web
site and the software, and that should be up in the next week or two.

   Once we have something ready, we will share the information with the rest
of the world and give access to the new Wiki to the various maintainers to
help us keep the content up to date.

Thank you for your patience and your love for Mono!

Miguel
