It is more complicated, but not much more. And given the benefits that
can be reaped from such a setup,  there is little downside and a lot
of upside.

Now the question goes from &quot;when testing will be done so we can ship?&quot;
to &quot;how many weeks can we be ahead of schedule?, can competition keep
up with us?&quot;

And the code in SVN/CVS remains stable and ready to go at all times.

It is a matter of reducing the friction in the software production process.

Again, these are just suggestions and random bits of what I have
experienced. Not meant to impose on anybody.
