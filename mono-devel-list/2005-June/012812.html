mono (not any CLR, but mono specifically)
pkg-config
gtk-sharp
gnome-sharp
gconf-sharp
gtkhtml-sharp
gecko-sharp
gtksourceview-sharp

(these are off the top of my head)

&gt;<i> 2. what parts of MonoDevelop could be modified or removed to allow it to

</I>
gconf-sharp would have to be replaced, however it is used *very*
sparingly, and could easily be extracted out.

gtkhtml-sharp is used to display the integrated documentation. This is
something that could be removed, or something that could be ported.
Because evo is being ported, and that uses gtkhtml3, i would recommend
looking into that.

gecko-sharp is barely used honestly. And even though we *could* remove
it, we would end up adding it back eventually for asp.net support.
However, to bootstrap the effort, I would recommend just removing it.
Although, paco and zbowling have had some success making it work on
win32 (I have used gecko-sharp on win32 before myself)

gnome-sharp is used for a couple widgets. Most likely, it could be
abstracted pretty easily.

gtksourceview-sharp is insanely important (obviously). This is something
that would have to be ported to run on win32.

As far as the mono + pkg-config deps. I would recommend working
initially with them, but as time goes on, it would be very nice to see
MD work on a pure .NET setup w/o mono at all.

&gt;<i> 3. who would be interested in heading this up?
</I>
Not me :)

I am interested in helping out as much as I can, and offering some
guidance, but I don't have time to lead such an effort.
