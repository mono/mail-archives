</I>
They are in C, where they are a const array. One advantage of having
them there is that we don't have to do conversions for different endian
systems.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; And for about 200KB of data, they are just for CJK cultures
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; so they won't be used unless we use those cultures to handle
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; culture-sensitive CJK collation. That is mostly waste of memory.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Not if the data doesn't get paged in ;-).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The memory system essentially does that via the mmap call, however it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hidden from view.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, they will be hidden from view, but don't they still eat
</I>&gt;<i> memory when mscorlib.dll is loaded? Don't they still get paged?
</I>
Memory in a mapped file that is never touched never gets read from the
disk, nor is physical memory allocated for it.
