Of course, I wanted comments, that's why I sent the patch to the list. I 
just was afraid it will not have too much response. The next time I will 
post it during the Boston working week.

&gt;<i>     - if it is integrated into &quot;make run-test&quot; in the
</I>&gt;<i>       containing directory (i.e. in mcs/class/System.XML).
</I>
No, it's not integrated. Now I understand, what confused in my message.

&gt;<i>     - if it is to generate a TestFixture class which contains
</I>&gt;<i>       Test case methods.
</I>
Impossible to make. w3c opens different files but the code that opens is 
the same. If I'd write regular TestFixture class, it would look like:

[TestFixture]
class C {
....
[Test]
public void f1 () {
	doc.Load(&quot;1.xml&quot;);
}
[Test]
public void f2 () {
	doc.Load(&quot;2.xml&quot;);
}


And so on, 3000 testcases.

&gt;<i>     - if it reports &quot;failure&quot; on &quot;you should remove fixed bugs
</I>&gt;<i>       from list&quot; cases (I mentioned above), since when it
</I>&gt;<i>       is standalone tests it dictates us to do that.
</I>
Sorry, I did not understand what do you mean here. How is it related to 
nunit?

&gt;<i> Not all of readers would read the entire patch. They will first
</I>&gt;<i> check ChangeLog (and/or the post itself) and see if it is
</I>&gt;<i> significant for themselves or not. If that is not understandable,
</I>&gt;<i> then they will ask what it means. That's what I did.
</I>
That's OK, but I did not understand question in your first mail.

&gt;<i> See how Rafi answered to the question, which clarifies things.
</I>
Yes, Rafi gave good reference.

Andrew.
