<PRE>Hello,

Andrew still haven't answered to my reply, but posted revised(?)
one instead. so I just post what I have in mind on the new one.

The core of what I really dislike about the proposal is that
it is said as &quot;policy&quot;. If it is something like &quot;guideline&quot;,
and replacing &quot;must&quot; with &quot;should&quot;, &quot;forbidden&quot; with
&quot;discouraged&quot; or &quot;not recommended&quot;, then yes it would be OK.

If you agree with me, then you don't have to read it anymore.


The effect of the &quot;policy&quot; is so TRIVIAL, since big thanks to
Andrew's effort on test drivers it will be anyways reported in
daily basis. On the other hand, people will become not likely
either to conform to the &quot;policy&quot;, or will just avoid making
patches. It will just &quot;twoddle&quot; (hey, shut up, my spell checker!)
them.

(Note that I already wrote that the FORBIDDEN policy should be
applied to patch writers as well. I believe there is no way
to object it.)

It's just 1/3 of my thoughts. If you agree with the talk above,
then I don't need to post remaining words, sorta noisy branches.
(I wish you don't cost me anymore.)

Atsushi Eno
