</I>
As for your request, with these simple steps below you can find
what is missing in your catalog.sed (as well as what I missed):

wget 
<A HREF="http://svn.myrealbox.com/viewcvs/*checkout*/trunk/mcs/class/System.XML/Test/System.Xml.Xsl/standalone_tests/catalog.diff?rev=40689">http://svn.myrealbox.com/viewcvs/*checkout*/trunk/mcs/class/System.XML/Test/System.Xml.Xsl/standalone_tests/catalog.diff?rev=40689</A>
mv catalog.diff\@rev\=40689 old-catalog.diff
patch catalog.xml old-catalog.diff -o catalog-correct.xml
diff catalog-correct.xml catalog-fixed.xml

As for regression matter ...

I guess originally you might have done the &quot;original&quot; test run
under Windows, and run on Unix environment today. But it will
apparently show the difference. I have no further idea why
they look like &quot;regressions&quot;. They must have originally failed
under Unixy environment.

&gt;<i> BVTs_bvt083
</I>
Please re-read my first reply. This is not the missing-file case.

&gt;<i> ConflictResolution__77902
</I>
Well, this actually is an error in the stylesheet (includes
&quot;xslt09009a.xsl&quot; while there is only &quot;XSLT09009a.xsl&quot;). So this
testcase is invalid. Since on Windows file names are case
insensitice, MS.NET will pass this testcase. Anyways this is not
Mono's &quot;regression&quot; and should be ignored instead.

&gt;<i> Include__77736
</I>
There is no xslt03022.xsl. There is only XSLT03022.xsl.

&gt;<i> Include_Include_IncludedStylesheetShouldHaveDifferentBaseUri
</I>
Similar to ConflictResolution__77902 there is no &quot;TestInc&quot;
directory (and even worse the path includes backslash).
Should be ignored as well.

&gt;<i> Include_RelUriTest1
</I>
Ditto. No &quot;include&quot; directory.

&gt;<i> And there are few testcases that are not catched by the current 
</I>&gt;<i> testsuite, probably should check them manually (may be they really pass?)
</I>
 &gt; Elements__89171
 &gt; Elements__89177

They are the case: no Plants.xml but plants.xml.

&gt;<i> Output__84011
</I>
No OutputText.xml but Outputtext.xml.

&gt;<i> Text__78309
</I>
No XSLT05001.xml but xslt05001.xml.


&gt;<i> Currently we have only 2:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> selected
</I>&gt;<i> checked
</I>
Ahh, gotcha. Yeah let's add those you listed up as well.
