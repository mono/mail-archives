Yes.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; explain me what should I modify.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I committed something similar to this.

</I>
The MWF one I didn't move yet because it had a method that I did not
understand. Eventually, it should be migrated as well.

&gt;<i> It will be much easier to update the Locale.cs.:)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Two more unneceassary Locale.cs files:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> mcs/class/System.Data/System.Data/Locale.cs should be deleted as it is not

</I>&gt;<i> mcs/tools/resgen/Assembly/Locale.cs should be removed and
</I>&gt;<i> mcs/build/common/Locale.cs should be used instead.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                    RelPath = &quot;../../build/common/Locale.cs&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                    RelPath = &quot;../../build/common/MonoTODOAttribute.cs&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will fix it. Otherwise, you can always have a makefile target that will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; copy the files if it is on a windows box or something. If we are going
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to have a serious i18n framework, it's going to be extremely painful to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; force people to copy and paste the code like that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> VS.NET cannot load project files unless they are inside the project
</I>&gt;<i> directory so a makefile modificatio seems to be the solution. Currently,
</I>&gt;<i> when Locale.cs usually had only method in Locale.cs there were 7 variants
</I>&gt;<i> and this would grow to more if we let them separated. So I think this
</I>&gt;<i> disadvantage (VS.NET project) is worth for the benefits of a single copy.
</I>
in MCS we have:

                &lt;File
                    RelPath = &quot;CryptoConvert.cs&quot;
                    Link = &quot;..\class\corlib\Mono.Security.Cryptography\CryptoConvert.cs&quot;
                    SubType = &quot;Code&quot;
                    BuildAction = &quot;Compile&quot;
                /&gt;

Maybe that would work.

It's not a smart idea to duplicate this code even once. We *will* forget
to update it, and will end up with problems.
