They only happen because we didn't get the suse 9.2 build for gtk#2.

I am well aware. We can work on fixing suse 9.2 gtk# 2 builds.

You have to realize, the installer is just a hit and miss kinda thing.
We can't possibly test it everywhere it will be run. It does not check
dependencies, and so problems (like the ones you've had) are experienced
at runtime not install time. The installer generally installs a working
MonoDevelop. However, getting a working gtk# and monodevelop setup is
not something we can promise as well with that installer.
