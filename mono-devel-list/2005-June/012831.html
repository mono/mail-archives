I understand that it is likely to happen we don't receive any
comments, but in such cases the way to go is not to urge people
but to wait more :-)

Yeah, that's what I had in mind you might created, by writing
kind of code generator. It's not that difficult, like iterate
test master file, call Console.WriteLine (&quot;[Test]public void
TestBlah(){...&quot;); and so on, and I know you are (at least
sometimes) kind of magician ;-)

I was afraid of such thing above because it could be messy even
though it might be useful for reporting one error for one test.

</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, I did not understand what do you mean here. How is it related to

</I>
In the existing standalone testing, it says like &quot;remove fixed
tests from KnownFailures&quot;. What I am afraid is that it might report
the message kinda above as a test failure. Now that it turned out
that it is not integrated to the existing NUnit tests, we don't
have to worry about such things could be reported as a build/test
breakage, but it was what I have worried about.

So, now that it will not (or does not always) affect on the
build process, I think there is nothing to stop you ;-)
