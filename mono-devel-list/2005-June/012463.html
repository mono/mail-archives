Ok. But the problem is that about 90% of my diff file is just about removing
unnecessary Locale.cs files.:)
And if I were flood the list with patches to remove each Locale.cs in a
separate diff file I'm sure only about 2-3 of the 39 unnecessary Locale.cs
files (only in corlib is necessary plus a new common, and note that
System.Data has an unused copy as well)

The problem is that file deletion results in listing the whole file with
minus signs in the diff file.
