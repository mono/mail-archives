Not too much ;-). Well, it might make a difference if on the same box
somebody is using mono and libmono.so -- but not a big issue.

I've no idea what kind of data is in the table, and if it is endian
dependent. If it's just a byte array, we'd be fine...

&gt;<i> The resource approach has also the downside that access to it would be

</I>
Well, since we are in corlib, we can get the void* ;-).


Anyways, I think the two approaches don't make much difference in terms
of performance (except possibly the endian stuff). Where there is a
difference is in terms of development model:

If we want to include the stuff in the C runtime, we pretty much have to
check in the generated file to SVN. We can't run C# code before the
runtime is compiled. OTOH, if we include the stuff as a managed resource
to corlib, we could run a mono app at that point to generate the file.

While this stuff is in active development, checking in a large file to
svn is probably going to make mono-patches-list a bit annoying.

So maybe the best plan would be a managed resource for now, and once the
table is stable, moving it into C if that makes a substantial
performance difference.
