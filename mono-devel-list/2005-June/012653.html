<PRE>&gt;<i>From: Raja R Harinath
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>I don't know much about the Windows world, but IIRC, you have to say
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>you're targetting 'mingw' rather than 'cygwin'.  You'll then get
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>libmono-1.dll and libMonoPosixHelper.dll -- I don't think you can escape
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>the lib prefix either, but it's at least bearable.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have never tried to compile Mono under mingw and and I don't know
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whether
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it can be compiled under mingw. But I don't want to compile it under
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mingw
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so I don't care.:)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I wasn't suggesting that you build _under_ mingw.  I was suggesting that
</I>&gt;<i>you build _for_ mingw, since that's (almost) what we intend: we don't want
</I>&gt;<i>to depend on cygwin libraries.
</I>
I don't know what exactly you want to suggest. I build Mono on Windows under
Cygwin (I think just as anyone else). The build system uses &quot;-nno-cygwin&quot; so
the resulting binaries are not dependent on Cygwin.

But the problem is that even those libraries built with &quot;-nno-cygwin&quot; will
the the 'cyg' prefix and I don't like it because it suggests that they
require Cygwing but in fact not. And thats why I proposed the patch.

By the way as I know MinGW is a build environment (I have never tried it)
rather than a runtime environment so I think I cannot build for MinGW, I can
build only under MinGW.
