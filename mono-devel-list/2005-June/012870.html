&gt;&gt;<i> I'll apply the patch attached after your commit.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, you don't have to add this nunit test (I am talking about 
</I>&gt;<i> EntityDeclarationNotWF ). It already exists in W3C, it's id is 
</I>&gt;<i> valid-sa-086.
</I>
It's different from valid-sa-086. It tests *invalid* document
(that one I pointed out why your previous patch was not fine).

&gt;&gt;<i> What does this mean? I guess you have in mind that there are cases that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> entities could be used inside attributes, but attribute content check
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is less prohibiting and '&lt;' characters are checked anyways.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not only in attributes. One of the tests went through the following flow:
</I>&gt;<i> DTD had entity declaration pointing to external xml, which had in turn 
</I>&gt;<i> it's own DTD. It is in valid-sa-100 test. So what happened is because 
</I>&gt;<i> current implementation makes early evaluation, it read the external 
</I>&gt;<i> source and failed because the context was Element, and Element can't 
</I>&gt;<i> have DTDs. So here we have a coincident of 2 things: early evaluation 
</I>&gt;<i> and Element context. So I understood that it's not always might be in 
</I>&gt;<i> Element context.
</I>
Oh, I see. There's another reason to fix entity resolution stuff
should be improved. Mhm, actually the testcase I've attached is
a strong counterpart of temptation to change implementation to
make it to take lazy evaluation way :(

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (BTW we won't understand what &quot;-AS&quot; means there ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> svn blame will help curious hackers ;-) but if it's not acceptable, I'll 
</I>&gt;<i> remove it.
</I>
That's exactly the reason why you *don't* need &quot;-AS&quot; there ;-) (and
most of us won't know what AS means. At least &quot;- Andrew&quot; is much
better (but we usually don't record our names. Yeah, it depends on
the projects and organizations though).

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Besides the comment itself.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In fact I also don't like that part of code. Actually, though
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> replacing entities with a simple string is good for performance
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as compared to such code that loads entity possibly from external
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> files every time, it causes incorrect BaseURI resolution (that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> results in incorrect not-wf error for XHTML 1.1 DTD; bug #51495).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, basically rewriting that entity expansion part is the best
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solution. But I haven't tried that since it will not be done as a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quick hack and it will first result in several breakage in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> standalone tests.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's why I made this patch very carefully, to make minimal impact. I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't have plans to improve this code right now.
</I>
That's part of why I don't love that enormous tests. Maybe no one
including you will never fix those &quot;big&quot; problem, or make
significant contributions. I'd even like to accept some regressions
in front of such big improvements if any. XML standalone tests are
so canonical pretty enough.
