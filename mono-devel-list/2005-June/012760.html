As I said, the lock is MUCH more expensive than the barrier ;-).

Because our interests are (in order):

     1. Correct code
     2. Code that is not noticeably slow to the user
     3. Readable/Maintainable/Clear code
     4. Micro-tuned code

Your stuff falls under 4.

Anyways, there is no use arguing about this stuff. If you can show that
more complex code results in a measurable speedup, feel free to bring it
up ;-).

In the meanwhile, I've done a few data-collection things:

[<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">benm at omega</A> ~]$ mono --trace=T:Locale install/lib/monodoc/browser.exe
ENTER: Locale:GetText (string)([STRING:0x42720:EST], )
LEAVE: Locale:GetText (string)[STRING:0x42720:EST]
ENTER: Locale:GetText (string)([STRING:0x42738:EDT], )
LEAVE: Locale:GetText (string)[STRING:0x42738:EDT]

(this is after browsing about for a bit).

So, it looks like it is possible the people using DateTime will
experience a bit of slowness. However, I wonder if for this specific
case, we can rely on the OS's database of time zones.

On mcs, there were *no* calls to Locale.GetText except when I tried to
compile a non-existent file. In that case, the exception was caught,
however it was still localized. Can this be avoided?


As for the expense of the reflection stuff you used, I have this test
case:


&gt;<i> using System;
</I>&gt;<i> using System.Text;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> class X {
</I>&gt;<i>         static void Main ()
</I>&gt;<i>         {
</I>&gt;<i>                 Console.WriteLine (&quot;X&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i>                 //Console.WriteLine (typeof (X).Assembly.GetName ().Name);
</I>&gt;<i>         }
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>
I first did stats with the C.WL alone, and then with reflection:
