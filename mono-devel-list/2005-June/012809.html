<PRE>Sounds great. Sony will also sell a kbd, mouse, etc. for PS3 and they are
actively marketing it as a *computer* and not just a console. To demonstrate
that it really is a computer, they need to run an OS on it, therefore Linux.
&gt;<i>From what you describe, I hope (think) there will be a similar kit for PS3.
</I>I can imagine that any type of graphics app will fly under Mono on PS3. Even
WinForms (bitmaps etc.) should be really snappy. Can't wait.

Pete.

&gt;<i> So you're saying that it should be very little effort indeed, being 
</I>&gt;<i> mostly PowerPC
</I>
That's my understanding anyway, based on my experience with Mono and the
limited info about PS3 that is available now.

&gt;<i> I imagine that
</I>&gt;<i> Linux support on PS3 would be even better than PS2, given that Sony 
</I>&gt;<i> themselves will supply it on the (optional) hard drive.
</I>
Actually, the Linux Kit I'm talking about is an official Sony product, it's
unfortunatelly discontinued now (but there are always some on ebay).
See <A HREF="http://playstation2-linux.com">http://playstation2-linux.com</A> for some details.
Because it was an official product supplied by Sony, it runs on an unmodded
PS2. The kit itself consist of two DVDs (one with installation and another
one is boot disk), network adapter, _hard_drive_, USB keyboard, USB mouse,
and monitor cable adapter, there is also printed installation instruction
booklet and PS2 documentation plus some extra tools and libs on one of the
DVDs.
You need one spare memcard also, that is formatted during install and is
used to boot into Linux.
When it was still available from Sony it's price was around $150 (if memory
serves).
Linux itself runs ontop of so-called Run-Time Environment, so you don't
actually have direct access to all of the hardware, i.e. IOP, DVD drive,
sound hardware are protected. But Emotion Engine and Graphics Synthesizer
are fully documented and accessible.
The whole thing is most useful for those who want to get into PS2 graphics
programming, since official devkits are only available for registered devs
(and are expensive).
It's possible to use it as a desktop computer but is not really practical.
In fact, there was similar hobbyist programming kit available for
Playstation1 as well (called Net Yaroze), but it wasn't Linux-based.
So it's only logical if they will provide something like that for their new
platform, and most likely PS3 Linux will be _very_ similar to PS2 Linux kit.

Sergey
