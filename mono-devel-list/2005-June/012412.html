<PRE>Hello All,

 

            I woke this morning to find my code that runs itself in a
loop and processes commands as it's given them.  I found it offline,
which normally wouldn't bother me, until I tried to restart it.  It
goes through its normal sequence before coming to its looped state of
wait, and a second or two later the console just says Killed, and it
drops back to the shell.  Here are the last lines from mono &#8211;v

The code seems to run fine if I copy it back to my win32 machine, so
I'm not exactly sure what to make of it, and of course my last copy of
these code source is extremely out dated, and I'm not sure where my
good copies went in the move.  Has anyone seen/know how to fix this?
(it doesn't seem to do this when I run the code as root, but only as a
normal user)
 

Thanks!
