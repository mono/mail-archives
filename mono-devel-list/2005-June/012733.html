<PRE>Hi,

&gt;&gt;<i> Cant the same be said about the table that Atsushi is creating?  Do we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really worry about the 200k replicated between Mono and libmono.so.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not too much ;-). Well, it might make a difference if on the same box
</I>&gt;<i> somebody is using mono and libmono.so -- but not a big issue.
</I>
They are not only 200KB tables (that number is just for CJK
support which is rarely required) but about 500KB as a whole.

&gt;<i> I've no idea what kind of data is in the table, and if it is endian
</I>&gt;<i> dependent. If it's just a byte array, we'd be fine...
</I>
Well, I need more clarification for them.

- For standard collation support (numbers are in length):
  - byte[] : 153360.
  - int[] : 13552.
  - some extent of additional byte[] : maybe less than 5000
- for CJK support which is rarely used:
  - ushort[] : 20000 * 3 + 30000
  - byte[] : 20000
- for String.Normalize() which is only for .NET 2.0:
  - byte[] : 30000
  - int[] : 2700
  - short[] : 17600
  - maybe additional int[] : 4000

So, they are mostly byte for collation, except for CJK support
which is not referenced unless we use CompareInfo methods from
CJK cultures. So I think managed resources won't be bad here.

For String Normalization related stuff, I still think it would be
better to have them in mscorlib.dll since they are unused in the
default profile.

&gt;<i> If we want to include the stuff in the C runtime, we pretty much have to
</I>&gt;<i> check in the generated file to SVN. We can't run C# code before the
</I>&gt;<i> runtime is compiled. OTOH, if we include the stuff as a managed resource
</I>&gt;<i> to corlib, we could run a mono app at that point to generate the file.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While this stuff is in active development, checking in a large file to
</I>&gt;<i> svn is probably going to make mono-patches-list a bit annoying.
</I>
I agree.

&gt;<i> So maybe the best plan would be a managed resource for now, and once the
</I>&gt;<i> table is stable, moving it into C if that makes a substantial
</I>&gt;<i> performance difference.
</I>
Ok, then right now I need to hack on corlib Makefile to run make
under Mono.Globalization.Unicode.
