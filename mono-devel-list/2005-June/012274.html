I can't name a single bug I have fixed that was both a) boring and b)
something I didn't need.

I have fixed plenty of boring bugs I needed, and plenty of bugs I didn't
need (like gacutil stuff) that weren't boring (to me).

I would challenge you to point to a single 'boring' (as martin put it)
bug that you fixed that had nothing to do with anything else you
wanted/needed.

As well, I am talking about today, if you look at the commit logs for
mcs/ mono/ and even gtk-sharp/ you will notice the predominance of
commits are coming from people who are payed in some way to do this. I
would consider almost every bit of mono code I've written in the last
year to be work related, as Medsphere was paying me to pursue specific
goals, in which some mono/gtk# work was needed.
