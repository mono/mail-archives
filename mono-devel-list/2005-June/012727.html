<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> &gt; BTW doesn't that mean all that kind of culture resources had better
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; become managed resources, unless they are required at runtime?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We also have huge culture-info-table.h and char-conversions.h
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in metadata.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> They are in C, where they are a const array. One advantage of having
</I>&gt;<i> them there is that we don't have to do conversions for different endian
</I>&gt;<i> systems.
</I>
Cant the same be said about the table that Atsushi is creating?  Do we
really worry about the 200k replicated between Mono and libmono.so.

And the libmono.a is only shipped to those developing. 

The resource approach has also the downside that access to it would be
through the Stream interface (even if mmapped) while getting a pointer
to a C-statically defined array would allow the corlib code to access it
without any wrapper code.

Both approaches enjoy the mmap benefits.

Miguel.
