As Hari says in his reply, you had send this patch before.  He dedicates 
a considerable amount of time to the well being of the build system.  I 
will follow his lead in this matter.

As for the actual installer script.  I have just committed the Inno 
Setup installer script that I created for Mono 1.1.8.  You can see it here:

<A HREF="http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/cvs/cvsbrowse.php/monowin32/installer/MonoSetup_1.1.8.iss">http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/cvs/cvsbrowse.php/monowin32/installer/MonoSetup_1.1.8.iss</A>

It is not my intention to over dramatize the work it takes to put out a 
release of the Mono Combined installer for Windows. However, I don't 
want anyone to think is trivial either.  Keep in mind that it also takes 
into account two versions of Gtk# and the underlying GTK+ as well as 
Glade and other GTK+ for Win32 samples and applications.  It also 
includes the xsp and other Mono applications like SQL# for Gtk#.  The 
Mono runtime and its SDK are also included in a package that facilitates 
its integration with the Windows Shell as well as coexistence and 
function with Cygwin if it is installed and configure to mount the 
location of the base directory of the resulting Mono installation to 
/usr/local.

You would also need Inno Setup 5.0.7 or higher.

Best regards.

Paco
