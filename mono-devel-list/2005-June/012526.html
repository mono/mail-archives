Since when has vs.net had issues with relative paths?

Chances are, something like:

                &lt;File
                    RelPath = &quot;../../build/common/Locale.cs&quot;
                    SubType = &quot;Code&quot;
                    BuildAction = &quot;Compile&quot;
                /&gt;


                &lt;File
                    RelPath = &quot;../../build/common/MonoTODOAttribute.cs&quot;
                    SubType = &quot;Code&quot;
                    BuildAction = &quot;Compile&quot;
                /&gt;

will fix it. Otherwise, you can always have a makefile target that will
copy the files if it is on a windows box or something. If we are going
to have a serious i18n framework, it's going to be extremely painful to
force people to copy and paste the code like that.


BTW, I had no idea what to do with locale.cs in MWF. There are stubs for
a bit of i18n, but that should probably get folded into whatever shared
framework we have. But there is a GetResource method that returns object
that I have no idea what it will do. For now, I didn't use the new
Locale.cs...
