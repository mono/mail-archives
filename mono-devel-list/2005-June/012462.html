As I mentioned to you on private email, there is a very big point to
doing this. By removing the duplicated code today, your patches tomorrow
will be easier for us to read.

I'm not suggesting that the Locale.cs today should be what we use
forever. I am suggesting: lets first get one Locale.cs which is the same
as we have today, and *then* start patching.
