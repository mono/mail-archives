<PRE>Except the case we want to drop the idea of using ResourceManager at all I
think my patch should be reviewed and then committed.

In the case you want to drop ResourceManager I have the following two
questions:
Why are we working on Mono if we think that it unsuitable for it's own needs
as well?
Why should we use a non existing infrastruncture for localization instead of
an already existing infrastructure?

Note that my Locale.cs patch does not store English resources in a hash
table and uses the same ResourceSet to implement GetResource for MWF as MWF
currently uses so it will have ignorable CPU and memory overhead but will be
able to localize resouces as it is intended to do that.
