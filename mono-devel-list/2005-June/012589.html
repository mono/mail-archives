Ah, good point. Luckily, both code paths wouldn't be slow in MWF land
(where speed is measured by the user, not a benchmark). Not to mention
that the code only showed up in corlib. (it is in an ifdef). But it is
good to keep that in mind.

Anyways, I am sure that localization is going to incur some overhead for
non-english cultures. For english, we should strive to make the overhead
near 0.
