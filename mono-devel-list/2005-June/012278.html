<PRE>&gt;<i> From: Ben Maurer
</I>&gt;<i> (the reason here is that I need to be able to make a svn snapshot and
</I>&gt;<i> easily change it so that there is a revision number based version at the
</I>&gt;<i> end. However, I can't know if the &quot;real version&quot; is 1.1.7 or 1.1.7.99.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, this totally restricts the version format to having 4 parts).
</I>
I think having some restrictions on the format of version number is required
if we want to use the version numbers for any purpose.
The version of course can be parsed from a string at runtime it has little
performance loss as long as the version number is in a form that can be used
in the constructor of System.Version.

&gt;<i> Btw, if we do this at all, lets also work on killing the horrible
</I>&gt;<i> version bump procedure we have today. Right now, you need to bump the
</I>&gt;<i> number of mcs, ilasm, etc.
</I>
For a managed application usually only the version of ther runtime is
inportant. It can be assumed that a specific version of the runtime comes
with a specific version of class library as the class library strongly
depends on the runtime.

Other utilities like mcs and ilasm are executed as external processes by a
managed application so their version can be checked using --version and it
is not required to have the same version number as the runtime.

&gt;<i>From: Rafael Teixeira
</I>&gt;<i>The configure.ac part doesn't work, as AC_INIT says that $VERSION
</I>&gt;<i>isn't a literal
</I>
This worked for me but it think using VERSION as a string in icall.c instead
of four integers would look better.

I attached a modified patch what do you think of this one?
