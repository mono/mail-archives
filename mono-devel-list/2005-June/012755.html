<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> &gt; Also, to apply this kind of patch that will affect everything, I would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like to know in advance the memory footprint (running mono --profile
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; before/after should tell us this) and how much extra code is JITed at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; startup (how much slower this becomes for a sample program).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with Ben that string are localized only several time and the little
</I>&gt;<i> performance overhead caused by localization can be ignored. (The overhead
</I>&gt;<i> should be little.)
</I>
Yes, but Ben limited himself to speculation.

I want to know the real impact (we have the tools, it should take a few
minutes at most to find out the numbers).

&gt;<i> And as I told several times in this topic the current ResourceSet is not
</I>&gt;<i> efficient. ResourceManager of MS.NET uses a custom resource set called
</I>&gt;<i> RuntimeResourceSet (private type, ResourceSet of MS.NET does the same as
</I>&gt;<i> Mono's one) that loads each resource (either string or object) when it is
</I>&gt;<i> needed instead of loading all of them at construction. It caches resource
</I>&gt;<i> once they was loaded. This could be used in Mono as well or if we want we
</I>&gt;<i> could use a ResourceSet that does no caching at all. But the advantages and
</I>&gt;<i> disadvantages of using no cache should be compared in real life before
</I>&gt;<i> making a decission.
</I>
Ah, interesting.  Am not familiar with this, but it sounds like we
should look into implementing this functionality.

&gt;<i> It's good.:) By the way, the most important thing: key/string technique will
</I>&gt;<i> have the same performance and memory requirements if you use the same
</I>&gt;<i> ResourceManager and ResourceSet classes. The only difference will be that it
</I>&gt;<i> will look up even English resources in a file that means some performance
</I>&gt;<i> overhead but I think it's so little that it can be ignored.
</I>
Well, I still want to have numbers at hand so we can make a decision. 

Miguel.
