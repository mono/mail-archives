I don't care about the performance of this method at all.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Other utilities like mcs and ilasm are executed as external processes by a

</I>
Right, I am saying: if you want to solve problems related to how we
handle version, lets fix the broken things we have all at once :-). The
AssemblyInfo.cs files for mcs, etc are not generated.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;The configure.ac part doesn't work, as AC_INIT says that $VERSION

</I>&gt;<i> This worked for me but it think using VERSION as a string in icall.c instead

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I attached a modified patch what do you think of this one?
</I>
Your patch will break if there are more than four version parts (which
might happen inside the build system because we munge the version
number).
