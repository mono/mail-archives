Well, if you already have a job (or are a student, etc), this is just
icing on the cake: maybe you can get an ipod after 10 bug fixes or
something.

Nobody is suggesting that you can make a carer out of bounties. Even if
priced well, its not reliable income etc.


On another note: if there are bugs in bugzilla that are simple enough
that $100 would make somebody look into them, its probably a bad sign:
we should be killing more low hanging fruit.
