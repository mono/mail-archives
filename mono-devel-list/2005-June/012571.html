&gt;<i>This does not work in VS.NET. Files has to be in the directory or
</I>&gt;<i>subdirectories of the project.
</I>
For the record, that is not correct; the grandparent is right.  It's a
common misconception that VS.Net requires all files to be in subdirectories
of the project dir, b/c by default VS.Net copies files there when you add
them, but that Link attribute in the &lt;File&gt; element above _does_ reference
another file elsewhere rather than making a local copy, and VS.Net knows
what to do with it.  Files that exist within a subdirectory of the project
dir don't have a Link attribute; its sole use is to link in files from other
directories.  VS shows a little shortcut overlay on the icon in Solution
Explorer to show that it's a link to another place.  Other than that,
working with the file is the same as any non-linked file in VS.  It's like
making a symlink within the folder that only VS can see.

To link a file into your project, rather than copying it there, you just
have to select &quot;Link File&quot; instead of &quot;Open File&quot; in the &quot;Add Existing Item&quot;
dialog.  The full procedure, starting w/ the context menu on a project, is
this:

Add-&gt;Add Existing Item -- Select File -- Click _down arrow_ next to Open
button-&gt;Link File.
