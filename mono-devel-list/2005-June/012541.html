Sorry, I was not yet subscribed to this list when that was discussed.
However, this is not really about XML.MiniParser - its just an example,
other spots with the same issue may exist.

Its not really a Pascal compiler bug btw. (besides that the &quot;error&quot;
should be labled a &quot;warning&quot;, which is currently under discussion)

Huh? Where did I mention VBC? Even if it did not complain, it does not
mean that this works. Did you try to access line *and* Line from VB?

&gt;&gt;<i> ps: the [CLSCompliant(*false*)] correctly declares  that piece of code

</I>
You are missing the point: If you have identifiers in *protected* or
*public* interfaces which differ by their case only, how should a
case-insensitive compiler access them? As long as you do not *touch*
them, the compiler still can produce the code though. (Basically VBC
just *hides* the fact that there are inaccessible things)

&gt;<i> If you were right,
</I>&gt;<i> then ANY types that is not CLSCompliant must not contain such
</I>&gt;<i> case-insensitively equivalent names, no?
</I>
&quot;Must not&quot; is relative - in private sections, you can do whatever you
want, but public/protected interfaces are the problem here - if
portability is one of the goals.
