<PRE>&gt;<i> From: Ben Maurer

&gt;<i> INSIDE_CORLIB is defined :-). You could always look at the commands make
</I>&gt;<i> runs...
</I>
I saw it on the command line, but is it safe to assume that INSIDE_CORLIB is
allways defined when mscorlib.dll is compiled and INSIDE_CORLIB is never
defined when any other assemblies are compiles?

&gt;&gt;<i> Please review this patch and approve it if you think so. Otherwise please
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> explain me what should I modify.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I committed something similar to this.
</I>
Seems to be good.
It was a good decission to leave Locale.cs of Managed.Windows.Forms alone
yet and to move MonoTODOAttribute.cs along with Locale.cs.

It will be much easier to update the Locale.cs.:)

Two more unneceassary Locale.cs files:

mcs/class/System.Data/System.Data/Locale.cs should be deleted as it is not
used.
mcs/tools/resgen/Assembly/Locale.cs should be removed and
mcs/build/common/Locale.cs should be used instead.

&gt;<i>                    RelPath = &quot;../../build/common/Locale.cs&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>                    RelPath = &quot;../../build/common/MonoTODOAttribute.cs&quot;
</I>
&gt;<i> will fix it. Otherwise, you can always have a makefile target that will
</I>&gt;<i> copy the files if it is on a windows box or something. If we are going
</I>&gt;<i> to have a serious i18n framework, it's going to be extremely painful to
</I>&gt;<i> force people to copy and paste the code like that.
</I>
VS.NET cannot load project files unless they are inside the project
directory so a makefile modificatio seems to be the solution. Currently,
when Locale.cs usually had only method in Locale.cs there were 7 variants
and this would grow to more if we let them separated. So I think this
disadvantage (VS.NET project) is worth for the benefits of a single copy.
