<PRE>Hi Hubert &amp; all,

My System.Windows.Forms Problem on my Gentoo Machine is solved! Thank U all :-)

I am using SVN Sources of Mono...and as Peter suggested I checked my /usr/local/etc/mono/config file for dll mappings....There it was...&quot;libX11&quot; had an empty target...so no mapping at all, I corrected the mapping and off we go with MWF :-)

Mono Debug Messages (after setting Variables Peter mentioned...) said something about &quot;lib.so&quot; not being loaded...

Problem solved, hope that helps Hubert...

Thanks Peter, Ben, ...

--Matt

Anyone who still has problems with this should:
      * Make sure they have a recent build. Basically, you should be
        past the 1.1.8 tag.
      * Make sure they have the X development package.
      * Do a clean build

If you still have problems please send:
      * config.log
      * data/config
      * the output of ldd `which xterm`
      * What distro you are on

Am sorry this is causing a few people problems. But this change is
really needed to ensure that users can use winforms. Without this
change, users would be required to download development libraries that
are not in the default install to get stuff working.
