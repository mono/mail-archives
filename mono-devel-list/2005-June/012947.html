<PRE>Hi,

On the list previously I was told that mingw target should be used instead
of cygwin. But currently it results in cygwin-1.dll dependency that is said
to be a bug in Mono build system.

I don't see any advantages of using mingw target because currently using
cygwing as target results in no cygwin-1.dll dependency and as long as I
build Mono on Cygwin it will use the header files of Cygwin so glib-devel of
Cygwin cannot be used anyway.

As I see the difference could be to compile on MinGW but I was told not to
compile on MinGW just target mingw on Cygwin.

Someone who is experienced in this question please let me know or explain
whether Cygwin or MinGW should be used and/or targeted and why.

My patch (I attached to this message) simply modifies the generated
aclocal.m4 just after it is generated to use no prefix for the target
cygwin. It is done by removing a single 'cyg' string from the file. It works
as expected without any drawbacks. It is searching for the string
's/^lib/cyg/' and replacing it to 's/^lib//'. It is very unlikely to apper
this string in any context other than modifying the output file name of the
library so I think it's safe to use.

I think there is no other solution (except modifying other generated files
like libtool) to modify or remove the prefix of DLL files. And if we will
use mingw32 target it will have 'lib' prefix but I think  there should be no
prefix at all. So we should modify aclocal.m4 anyway.

Please review this patch.

Korn&#233;l
