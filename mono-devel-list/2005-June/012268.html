While I don't agree with bounties on specific bugs, I also don't agree
with what you are saying at all. No one fixes a &quot;boring&quot; bug for free
anyway today. There are 2 types of people fixing them

1) People who need the fix.
2) People who are payed (by Novell, Mainsoft, whoever) to fix them.

This would add a third set of contributors fixing boring bugs, people
being payed by bounties.

I highly doubt as well, that any bounty would ever be significant enough
to actually make money on. Unless you think making 20$ for the 4 or 5
hours that a easy bug would take to fix (time to write the patch, get it
reviewed, get it into the codebase) is 'good money'.
