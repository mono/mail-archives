I don't think you could quote my post without seeing it. Anyways,
Am not seeing what you see. Maybe it would be the best if you
post testcases that shows why the patch is required. Next, the
patch has several changes in one file. There are things that could
be justified and that might not be. They do not look tied
together, so it is better if they are split.

Without them I don't think any of discussions can go efficiently.
Depending on the testcases that performant way might not be
possible. As long as I know MS.NET implementation is so cheap
that always reads document into DOM or something.

If XML schema is the document root, then there is no data content.
Existing implementation did handle content schema (at least it was
designed to do that) as long as it is the top-level content of the 
document element. I am not aware of practical cases that such
schemas in further depth are consumed (since 99.999% of .NET
DataSet users is not likely to have such documents).
