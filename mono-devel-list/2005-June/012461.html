<PRE>&gt;<i> I think you forgot to svn add the new file.
</I>
You are right I forgot it.:) The diff file was simply too large to notice
the missing file.:) I attached a new diff file.

&gt;<i> I think a good place to start is to check in the common Locale.cs code
</I>&gt;<i> (but *without* changing the contents of the Locale.cs file: IE, just
</I>&gt;<i> remove all the copy and paste crap). This will make your patches much
</I>&gt;<i> smaller. Anybody have an objection to this?
</I>
Originally I just wanted to replace the current Locale.cs that does
absolutely nothing with a proper implementation that supports multuple
languages and behaves like gettext () so it returns the message passed to
GetText for invariant culture.

Then you proposed to use a single copy in all of the assemblies instead of
multiple copies. I have done it.

But now you say not to use my version simply copy the current version to a
new location. This means you drop my patch. But as the current version does
nothing I think it's no use to do this.

Note that I have removed the unnecessary redundant Locale.cs files using svn
delete and this resulted in the - (minus) entries for each file in the diff
file.
