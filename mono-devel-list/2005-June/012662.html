<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i>From: Raja R Harinath
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Furthermore I don't know why is better to use --host=i586-pc-mingw if we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> build using cygwin and it already results no cygwin dependency. Does it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any advantage over building for cygwin?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * for now, the only reason to use mingw32 would be to avoid the 'cyg'
</I>&gt;<i>    prefix (conditional on fixing the bugs you found above)
</I>
MinGW has the prefix 'lib', Cygwin has the prefix 'cyg' but I think a native
Windows library should have no prefix at all. 'lib' prefix has traditions on
Linux 'cyg' prefix was introduced to indentify Cygwin libraries but on
Windows the standard naming convention is to use no prefix with .dll
extension.

My patch (I attached to this message) simply modifies the generated
aclocal.m4 just after it is generated to use no prefix for the target
cygwin. It is done by removing a single 'cyg' string from the file. It works
as expected without any drawbacks. It is searching for the string
's/^lib/cyg/' and replacing it to 's/^lib//'. It is very unlikely to apper
this string in any context other than modifying the output file name of the
library so I think it's safe to use.

I think there is no other solution (except modifying other generated files
like libtool) to modify or remove the prefix of DLL files. And if we will
use mingw32 target it will have 'lib' prefix but I think  there should be no
prefix at all. So we should modify aclocal.m4 anyway.

&gt;<i>  * in the long run, using mingw32 will free up the 'cygwin' target to let
</I>&gt;<i> us
</I>&gt;<i>    target a native cygwin build that allows us to depend on native
</I>&gt;<i>    cygwin X11/glib/gtk/gnome libraries.  Don't know if this is worth it.
</I>
I don't know whether it is possible to compile binaries that are using
X11/glib/gtk/gnome libraries without cygwin dependency. Currently non-Cygwin
libglib, libiconv and libintl has to be used. And I think this will not
change just by specifying mingw32 as target because cygwin has no other
versions of these libraries.
