Can you tell me exactly what did you fix by hand? As for the first 
question, here is the list of tests that throw exception on dotnet and 
were marked as regressions in the first list.

BVTs_bvt083
ConflictResolution__77902
Include__77736
Include_Include_IncludedStylesheetShouldHaveDifferentBaseUri
Include_RelUriTest1

And there are few testcases that are not catched by the current 
testsuite, probably should check them manually (may be they really pass?)

Elements__89171
Elements__89177
Output__84011
Text__78309

Let's decide about that later, OK?

&gt;<i> Besides the specification I tend to agree your idea to fix it.
</I>
Good.

&gt;<i> Am not sure what you mean &quot;pre-defined english words&quot;,
</I>
Currently we have only 2:

selected
checked

and may be we should have few others, like

disabled
readonly
multiple
ismap

that's what I can easily find, surely there are others.

&gt;<i> Let's put it on our table :-)

copy_copy21
