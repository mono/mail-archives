</I>
There is some difference in Mono and MS.NET implementation when no protocol
is enabled (Documentation was enabled). I have tried
DefaultWsdlHelpGenerator.aspx in MS.NET and Monos'
DefaultWsdlHelpGenerator.aspx in Mono the MS.NET's
DefaultWsdlHelpGenerator.aspx in Mono.

On MS.NET the service itself can be reflected but it appears as a service
without methods.
On Mono ServiceDescriptionCollection is empty and thus exception occurs.

So I do not commit this patch yet.
Some other parts of reflection has to be modified to can provide the same
behaviour that MS.NET has when there are no protocols enabled.
