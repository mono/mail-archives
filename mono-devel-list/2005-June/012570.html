<PRE>&gt;<i> From: Ben Maurer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I saw it on the command line, but is it safe to assume that INSIDE_CORLIB
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> allways defined when mscorlib.dll is compiled and INSIDE_CORLIB is never
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> defined when any other assemblies are compiles?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>
OK, thanks.

&gt;&gt;<i> Seems to be good.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It was a good decission to leave Locale.cs of Managed.Windows.Forms alone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yet and to move MonoTODOAttribute.cs along with Locale.cs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The MWF one I didn't move yet because it had a method that I did not
</I>&gt;<i> understand. Eventually, it should be migrated as well.
</I>
I told you that it was a good decission because I think so.:)
By the way it has a several things but only GetResource is used and is
important.

I sent &quot;[PATCH] New Locale.cs&quot; to this list. Later I reallized that
ResourceSet don't has to be thread safe and I attached a modified version to
this message. This Locale.cs has a GetResource method as well and implements
resource handling but behaves like gettext (). For more information please
see message &quot;[PATCH] New Locale.cs&quot;. Not that I did not remove Locale.cs
from MWF using the diff file to make it more clear but it should be removed.

Please review and if you (and/or anybody else) think so please approve the
patch.

&gt;<i> in MCS we have:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                &lt;File
</I>&gt;<i>                    RelPath = &quot;CryptoConvert.cs&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>                    Link =
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;..\class\corlib\Mono.Security.Cryptography\CryptoConvert.cs&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>                    SubType = &quot;Code&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>                    BuildAction = &quot;Compile&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>                /&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe that would work.
</I>
This does not work in VS.NET. Files has to be in the directory or
subdirectories of the project.

&gt;<i> It's not a smart idea to duplicate this code even once. We *will* forget
</I>&gt;<i> to update it, and will end up with problems.
</I>
The copies should not be checked in SVN but should be considered to copy
these files using the makefile to make VS.NET projects work.
