Well, thats what old-code was for in the first place. We've moved the
jit, the old swf impl, etc in there. All useful as references for a few
people.

It isn't even going into our tarballs. Doesn't matter much to me either
way.

Well, the spec file we maintain is ximian-build.conf in the release
module, which generates the rpm spec. No real reason to maintain it in
two places.

I've been meaning to have a packagers page with spec files from our
build system. I think that's a more viable solution...
