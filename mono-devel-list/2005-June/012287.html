<PRE>&gt;<i> There's a mention in libgc/include/private/gc_priv.h about USR2 already 
</I>&gt;<i> being used by linuxthreads when SIG_SUSPEND is redefined as SIGPWR. I have 
</I>&gt;<i> no idea if thats relevant anymore, though. I recall this only because 
</I>&gt;<i> FreeBSD had a problem with USR2 and USR2 that had to be changed there in 
</I>&gt;<i> libgc in the previous release.
</I>


To clarify a bit, Freebsd was using a ported version of the (userland) 
linuxthreads library in very early porting efforts of Mono under Freebsd4.x. 
In the ported version, TSTP and CONT were redefined as USR1 and USR2 in 
libgc, but I don't recall whether that was specific only to Freebsd. The 
current mention is specific to GC_LINUX_THREADS anyhow, but only when 
SUSPEND isn't defined, which seems pretty ancient...
