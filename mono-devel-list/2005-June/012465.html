<PRE>&gt;<i> As I mentioned to you on private email, there is a very big point to
</I>&gt;<i> doing this. By removing the duplicated code today, your patches tomorrow
</I>&gt;<i> will be easier for us to read.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not suggesting that the Locale.cs today should be what we use
</I>&gt;<i> forever. I am suggesting: lets first get one Locale.cs which is the same
</I>&gt;<i> as we have today, and *then* start patching.
</I>
What about a pacth that adds a common Locale.cs copy, modifies sources files
and removes unused Locale.cs files?

Not that the single Locale.cs cannot be the same as we have today because we
have 7 versions today. In fact there are 3 functionally different versions
only.

All of them contains &quot;static string GetText (string)&quot; but corlib has &quot;static
string GetText (string, params object [])&quot; and MWF has &quot;static object
GetResource(string)&quot;.

So I have to create a modified version from corlib's Locale.cs that has as
well &quot;static object GetResource(string)&quot;.

Do you think if I post the described patch it can be reviewed easily? If you
have comments please let me know what should I change.
