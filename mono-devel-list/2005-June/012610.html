<PRE>&gt;<i>From: Andreas Nahr
</I>&gt;<i> I think the question which needs to be answered first is: Does it really
</I>&gt;<i> make sense to translate all errormessages at all? Would we even be able to
</I>&gt;<i> maintain these for a number of languages and which gain would we get from
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>
If someone wants to traslate them he can do it. I personally don't want to
translate Mono to a bunch of languages.:) But I want to provide an
infrastructure that makes Mono able to be translated.

I attached my latest diff file (the same as in 2005-06-16 11:52 - Re:
[Mono-devel-list] [PATCH] Reworked unified Locale classes). Please have a
look at it if you haven't done it already.

It implements gettext () style resource management that means for me at
least that identifiers for non-English languages are the English texts and
no localization is done for English.

This implementation has minimal CPU and memory overhead compared to the
current version that does nothig. English messages are not stored in a
Hashtable just are returned as they were passed to GetText.

I think this is the best solution because it is based on the existing
localization infrastructure of Mono and I don't see any drawbacks that are
not in your conceptions.

Note that as I have written in my previous message even MS.NET uses a custom
ResourceSet for ResourceManager that don't load all the entries at
initialization. If we want to we can use a ResourceSet that does not cache
resources at all.
