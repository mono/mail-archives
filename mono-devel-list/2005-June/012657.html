<PRE>Hi,

Hmm...  I do know that.

Looks like I haven't made myself clear -- most probably since I assumed
a lot of context.

Anyway, I'm suggesting that you try running

  ./configure --host=i586-pc-mingw

inside cygwin.  Mono's configure.in already passes -mno-cygwin to gcc.
The configure command above informs the rest of the GNU build
environment about this: thus hopefully making libtool _not_ use the
'cyg' prefix.

However, this is totally untested, and may break.  My point being: this
is the way you should try to solve the problem mentioned in the subject.
If this doesn't work, it's a bug, and should be fixed.  (I can't fix it,
for the reasons above.)

To repeat, any patches to address the 'cyg' prefix issue should make the
above scenario work.  Putting on my &quot;part-time makefile maintainer&quot; hat,
I'm likely to strongly object to any other approach.  I am open to being
educated otherwise, of course, since I know that I don't know much about
this subject.
