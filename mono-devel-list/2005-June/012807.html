<PRE>Sergey, you're da man ;-). So you're saying that it should be very little
effort indeed, being mostly PowerPC. That's excellent news. I imagine that
Linux support on PS3 would be even better than PS2, given that Sony
themselves will supply it on the (optional) hard drive. I'll be queueing
when they are released. Can't wait to run my Mono stuff on it.

Pete.

Subject: Re: [Mono-devel-list] Will Mono run on Playstation 3

I'd like to add my 2 cents to this Mono/PS3 discussion:
Awhile back, I had ported Mono (interpreter only) to PS2/Linux, and it took
me like 2-3 hours actually.
If Linux support for PS3 is anything like the current PS2 Linux kit, it
shouldn't be any more difficult than that.
CELL stuff is really quite irrelevant to Mono-&gt;PS3 porting, it's only
PowerPC core that matters, and a lot of PPC-related work is already done.

&gt;<i> that would also mean that it would be very possible to use Sony games on
</I>your own Pc.

Not at all, whatever OS will be used on PS3 just doesn't matter in this
case, even porting (PS3/Linux-&gt;PC/Linux) wouldn't be any easier than it's
now.
Hey, it's like expecting to play Dreamcast/WinCE games on your PocketPC
(same OS)!

Sergey
