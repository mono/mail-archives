<PRE>When doing major collections, sgen must know where a given object lives
(it's space), if it's on the nursery,
a major block, a large object and so on.

Right now, to identify a large object we calculate the object size and check
against a constant.
This is not very cache friendly and requires 5 memory loads for a regular
object.

The idea then is to have a faster way to identify this using an
address-&gt;space dictionary and this is
were the block map comes in.

The current design requires only 3 loads to identify the space of an object
of which 2 will probably
be very cache hot.

Since object spaces are very large memory regions we can get away with a
simple 2 level sparse
array with a granularity of 4096 bytes or more.

The current design is heavily inspired on boehm's implementation. It uses a
2 level sparse map
indexed on the pointer value, which is a fancy way of saying an array of
arrays.

pointer bits
31....22      21...12           11..0
first level    second level    ignored

To avoid a null check when resolving the second level, we use a single entry
filled with null.

Under 64 bits we replace the first level with a hashtable using bits 63..32
as hashes.

I'm glad you asked, because now that I've written a good explanation of it,
I just came to realize that it
can be improved by encoding the kind of space on the block pointer itself as
it will save a memory load.

&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   For the sake of us that do not really speak the GC lingo, would you
</I>&gt;<i> mind explaining what block map support for SGen is?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The attached patch set implements block map support for sgen. It uses
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a schema similar to boehm's, which is a 2 level sparse map.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Under 64 bits it uses hashing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I benchmarked a modified binary-trees without valuetypes. Block maps
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gives a very modest speedup under major-copying (about 2%) and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nothing under major-marksweep. I've only used the block map for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; major_copy_or_mark_object thou. There are probably other places it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; oould be used too.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The design is basically the same as boehm's except for a few things:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -It doesn't store list heads or address on each segment. This allows
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; segment's size to be a power of 2; and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -LOS is handled by filling all covering slots with its block instead
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of using forwarding
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Few notes:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Segments are not deallocated since this requires either scanning whole
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; segments on each deallocation or keeping block counts.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And it's probably not needed since Boehm doesn't do it. It's doable as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; long as the block map is only read during GC and mutated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with the gc lock held.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 64bits support has not been committed since it is a minor change to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the code in sgen-gc.c and I want to have the current change set
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; validated first.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A small config option that uses either a 3 level map or just hashing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; under 32bits can be done with ease.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The embedding of Block in MSBlockInfo wastes a word of memory. This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could be worked out by either factoring Block::role into a separate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; struct or by using Block::next in place of MSBlockInfo::next.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Rodrigo
