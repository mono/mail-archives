You can insert arbitrary Xml into a .csproj and VS will 
maintain it there intact.  (This works, at least, for 
top-level children of the &lt;Project&gt; node.)  MSBuild will 
process the Xml as build commands when it loads your project 
file.  So, for example, you can add additional &lt;Import&gt; 
nodes into the projects to pull in custom Mono targets files 
to do some of the following things.

&gt;<i> 1. Can we build using either .Net compilers or mono compilers?
</I>
The basic definitions for the build are in the file 
Microsoft.CSharp.targets in the Framework directory; from a 
quick glance over the &lt;CoreCompile&gt; target, you can set the 
CscToolExe and CscToolPath variables to whatever you want.

&gt;<i> 2. Is there the concept of make and make install (building class libs versus
</I>&gt;<i> installing them in some location)?
</I>
There is a concept of post-build execution; it's not exactly 
the same as 'make install' but that's typically what I've 
used it for.  You do this by creating a post-build event 
hook as shown here:

&gt;<i> 3. Running unit tests
</I>
This one is a bit trickier; I've never done it outside of 
using TFSBuild, which has a custom task for it.  But I would 
assume you could just launch mstest.exe from a post-build 
event, or create a custom Mono target that wraps the logic up.
