This happened to me too, but I found the cause. It was a disposable object
that I replaced with another one without disposing of it first.

In my case, I found out doing the following gave the best results as far as
memory is concerned:

myobj.Dispose();
myobj = null;
myobj = newobj;

Without setting the object to null, memory is fred later.
After that, Mono and .NET both used as much memory.

Personally, every time I've had memory leaks, it was due to objects that
implement IDisposable that weren't disposed. So far, I didn't really need to
use a profiler, as I could find out exactly when memory wasn't released by
simply using my application and watching memory usage.
