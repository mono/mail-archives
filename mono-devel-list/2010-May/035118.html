The god is called Marek :) and he found out that the .response
file order in which mscorlib is compiled, is different between
Linux and Windows.

The good (or bad?) news are that the issue is reproducible
under Linux as well:

	cd mcs/class/corlib
	touch corlib.dll.linux-excludes
	make clean
	LC_ALL=C make

Anyways, Marak has committed a patch against the build system
that works around the runtime issue.
