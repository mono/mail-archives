<PRE>Does xbuild already convert solutions to a hidden .proj and run it, as
msbuild does?
If so, we just keep the solutions as &quot;master&quot; build files for each
profile: for example: mono-core-profile-2.0.sln,
mono-core-profile-4.0.sln, etc.. Which enables to build from either
the IDE and the command line, exactly the same build.

The Debug/Release targets would build just the managed libraries,
specific FullDebug/FullRelease targets could be the ones that build
also the runtime (including native code), and
RuntimeDebug/RuntimeRelease targets would build just the runtime
(bootstrap part).

Monodevelop would need to support working with .sln files (VS2008
compatible ones, until VS2010 gets more deployments) to make it a
fully all-devs-can-get-in proposition.

i do have projects that need to mix  building things that VS doesn't
handle too well (like building sub-solutions with another VS version,
and packaging and building libs with other tools/languages), for that
cases I do have some fake .csproj, with the building instructions, I
even developed some custom tasks to wrap some tools that msbuild
doesn't support directly. I think that would be the case to have the
builds of the runtime, native libs and corlibs, integrated.

Also I do have lots of older projects that use a mix of NAnt (as the
main build driver) and msbuild, that i'm slowly migrating to use only
msbuild, as I need to touch them. Although NAnt has a more imperative
way of doings, which looks more easily recognizable by most devs, i
think that msbuild data-flow driven (kind of functional) design scales
better to future parallelization of the build process.

Just sharing my experience with mixed .NET/native projects in
windowsland... Worth 2 cents as always... :)

Fun,
