&gt;<i>  Hi there,

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I have experienced similar behavior. When app was running under .NET the
memory was freed, but switching  to Mono caused memory to climb up. I did
some investigation but I couldn't find anything wrong with the code - I had
tried all profilers available for mono. The I gave my app a little time and
memory was eventually freed but after a longer period of time - maybe it's
the same situation?
