<PRE>Hello Rodrigo and all,

Returning to my old problem which deals with alignment of vector variables.
I noticed that on x86 vector locals are aligned at 8-byte boundary instead
of 16-byte thus causing to use 'movups' instead of much more efficient
'movaps'.
On PowerPC there is no such &quot;bug&quot;, so I tried to compare their routines for
locals' allocation.  In 'mini-x86.c', in function 'mono_arch_allocate_vars',
I discovered this strange (to me) piece of code:

         /*
          * EBP is at alignment 8 % MONO_ARCH_FRAME_ALIGNMENT, so if we
          * have locals larger than 8 bytes we need to make sure that
          * they have the appropriate offset.
          */
         if (MONO_ARCH_FRAME_ALIGNMENT &gt; 8 &amp;&amp; locals_stack_align &gt; 8)
                 offset += MONO_ARCH_FRAME_ALIGNMENT - sizeof (gpointer) *
2;

AFAIU, 'if's condition satisfied when there are vector locals and in that
case 'offset' is incremented by 16-4*2=8 bytes thus spoiling the alignment.
I tried to remove these lines and didn't notice anything bad, except that
alignment got fixed.
Moreover, there is no such lines in 'mini-amd64.c'.

Can somebody explain to me the meaning of this piece?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hello all,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm currently working on PowerPC port of Mono which utilizes AltiVec SIMD
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instructions. During the development I've encountered an alignment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As far as I understood from running Mono's JIT, stack-allocated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mono.Simd.Vector* types are always aligned by 16 byte bound, but global
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ones aren't (such as static class members). This is not a problem for SSE
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which has unaligned load/stores but AltiVec doesn't have them. Instead of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementing misaligned loads/stores for AltiVec I think it's better to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> force alignment in global variables, as it done in the case of stack.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, the JIT doesn't align all Vector types to 16 bytes. There are places,
</I>&gt;<i> like spill, code that
</I>&gt;<i> still doesn't do it correctly. Not a lot of work to get there, but still
</I>&gt;<i> not done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If by global variables you mean statics, then making them properly aligned
</I>&gt;<i> is possible with some trickery.
</I>&gt;<i> The only issue alignment issue we can't currently fix are heap objects due
</I>&gt;<i> to how our GC works.
</I>&gt;<i> Our new GC might eventually gain the ability to properly align such
</I>&gt;<i> objects, but this is something
</I>&gt;<i> for the far future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can somebody help me with that (e.g. point at relevant places in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 'mini-ppc.c')?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To fix the alignment of stack variables you need to mess with a bunch of
</I>&gt;<i> places:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -The spill code from mini-codegen.c
</I>&gt;<i> -The var allocation code in mono_allocate_stack_slots (mini.c)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To fix the static storage alignment you need to change the code that
</I>&gt;<i> allocate the statics area
</I>&gt;<i> to use the proper alignment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is the same problem as with objects as it uses a gc routine to
</I>&gt;<i> allocate the memory blob.
</I>&gt;<i> Fixing this requires boing deep into the GC, which is not something simple.
