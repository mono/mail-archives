OK, that makes sense. I skipped custom attributes in my mcs IKVM.Reflection hack, so that may account for not running into that.

I don't really like AssemblyBuilder.__SetName(), however. How about adding __SetVersion(), __SetCulture() and __SetKeyPair()?

&gt;<i> Blob encoded pseudo custom attributes are supported by Mono. I've added
</I>&gt;<i> decoding because they weren't ignored, exceptions were thrown instead.
</I>
Yes, I'll fix the code not to throw exceptions, but silently ignore them (like .NET does).

&gt;<i> Unlike Java, C# has support for backward jumps, so does
</I>&gt;<i> System.Reflection.Emit so support for that will have to be implemented.
</I>
The &quot;backwards branch constraint&quot; is an ECMA CIL restriction. The Microsoft CLR supports code that violates it, but years ago when I first found out about this it was because ikvm generated code that violated it and Mono didn't support that. So, I don't think it is necessary to support this (as it isn't valid ECMA CIL anyway). If mcs generates code that triggers this exception, then it is a bug in ILGenerator, or a bug in mcs.

&gt;<i> Based on your questions I belive that you are trying to remain
</I>&gt;<i> compatible with MS.NET.
</I>
Yes. However, I'm all for adding extra functionality (either by __ methods or by having ___ settings to enable/disable specific behavior).

&gt;<i> I on the other hand belive that removing arbitrary limitations of
</I>&gt;<i> System.Reflection.Emit (like preventing access to TypeBuilder's member-
</I>&gt;<i> builders), and adding missing functionality would make sense.
</I>
I agree, but I don't want to create a situation where you unintentionally depend on an IKVM.Reflection specific feature. Based on your work I have identified a couple of cases where things can be improved (e.g. I agree that the __GetDeclaredXxx methods should expose unbaked members in TypeBuilders).

&gt;<i> I also like the concept of having a Universe since that makes possible
</I>&gt;<i> to have multiple compiler instances in the same AppDomain.
</I>
Yes, I made the mistake in ikvm/ikvmc to have lots of statics and didn't want to make that mistake again ;-)

&gt;<i> I belive that pseudo custom attributes and unmanaged resource generation
</I>&gt;<i> does not fit well to the concept of System.Reflection.Emit.
</I>
I kind of agree. I will add a mode to disable them and add specific __ methods to do the equivalent.

&gt;<i> I also belive that CustomAttributeData should not be used as a provider,
</I>&gt;<i> __GetCustomAttributes (non-standard since is returning constructor
</I>&gt;<i> arguments rather than class instance) methods should be added to
</I>&gt;<i> reflection classes. An ICustomAttributeProvider interface (with
</I>&gt;<i> IsDefined and __GetCustomAttributes methods) would be very useful as
</I>&gt;<i> well.
</I>
Agreed.

Regards,
Jeroen
