<PRE>Hi,

That would be a better idea. Updating Universe.assembliesByName also
would make sense.

</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;backwards branch constraint&quot; is an ECMA CIL restriction. The Microsoft CLR supports code that violates it, but years ago when I first found out about this it was because ikvm generated code that violated it and Mono didn't support that. So, I don't think it is necessary to support this (as it isn't valid ECMA CIL anyway). If mcs generates code that triggers this exception, then it is a bug in ILGenerator, or a bug in mcs.
</I>
Right, your check implements the ECMA requirements. There must be some
other problem then... I'll analyze that later.

&gt;&gt;<i> Based on your questions I belive that you are trying to remain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compatible with MS.NET.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. However, I'm all for adding extra functionality (either by __ methods or by having ___ settings to enable/disable specific behavior).
</I>
Using global (or instance-wide) flags may not be that good. Having
__methods that behave differently or have arguments (boolean or enum)
that either enable MS.NET compatible behavior or some other custom
behavior should be considered as well. In the latter case MS.NET
compatible methods could simply call the __ methods with parameters that
ensure MS.NET compatible behavior.

&gt;&gt;<i> I belive that pseudo custom attributes and unmanaged resource generation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does not fit well to the concept of System.Reflection.Emit.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I kind of agree. I will add a mode to disable them and add specific __ methods to do the equivalent.
</I>
That would be awesome.

&gt;&gt;<i> I also belive that CustomAttributeData should not be used as a provider,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> __GetCustomAttributes (non-standard since is returning constructor
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> arguments rather than class instance) methods should be added to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reflection classes. An ICustomAttributeProvider interface (with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IsDefined and __GetCustomAttributes methods) would be very useful as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed.

</I>
CustomAttributeData is not just the data store, it's methods are the
only public API to obtain custom attributes (using the provider design
pattern). ICustomAttributeProvider name can be retained because
IsDefined is totally compatible while using __GetCustomAttributes marks
that it is non-standard.

</I>
My bad. I should have say that unmanaged resource generation does not 
well fit to the concept of AssemblyBuilder. There should be a better 
unmanaged resource generation class that fits System.Reflection.Emit 
better. The best example is that Mono's SRE has hack for unmanaged 
resource generation in compiler context mode.

After reading both of your responses I belive that pseudo custom 
attributes is not that harmful but there should be SetCustomAttribute 
methods (on each SRE class that supports custom attributes) that treats 
pseudo custom attributes like a compiler does, and a variant that just 
emits all the attributes.

Maybe there should be three modes:
- processing all pseudo custom attributes
- emitting all of them as custom attributes
- MS.NET compatible
