The soft debugger commands are only be enabled when you target Mono
2.6 or later, because the soft debugger was only added in Mono 2.6.
However, you can target a Mono 2.6+ from a MD that's running on Mono
2.4 using MD's support for multiple target runtimes.

However, Ubuntu removed the soft debugger addin from their MonoDevelop
2.2 build, because it includes a binary dll copied from Mono 2.6 :/

&gt;<i> Also I have two parallel mono environment (mono 2.6.4 and mono 2.7) and
</I>&gt;<i> tried to debug my applications with debugger from md 2.2 with no success. I
</I>&gt;<i> did not try to recompile MD 2.2 from sources yet (shoud I recompile or maybe
</I>&gt;<i> there is the way to add Soft Debugger to MD 2.2 without recompilation?)
</I>
An unmodified MD 2.2 build has the soft debugger addin. You could try
extracting the soft debugger addin dlls from the 2.2.2 rpms and
manually installing them.

&gt;<i> But I tried to check out MD from trunk, recompiled it under mono 2.6.4 and
</I>&gt;<i> software debbuger appeared in the list and I now can debug my app under
</I>&gt;<i> 'Soft Debugger' both in the 2.6.4 and 2.7 mono environment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Generic mono debugger does not work with MD2.4 under mono 2.6.4 environment,
</I>&gt;<i> throwing 'MissingMethod' exception when evaluating watch (DeclaringType in
</I>&gt;<i> Mono.Debugger.Method). I don't know why this happens, I examined assembly,
</I>&gt;<i> which monodevelop tries to load (Mono.Debugger.dll from /opt/mono26) and it
</I>&gt;<i> seems, that the assembly has this method (if I understood right the output
</I>&gt;<i> of monodis)
</I>
I really don't know much about the MDB addin or whether it can work
with multiple target Monos. You could try filing a bug or asking on
the MD list. But if you have the soft debugger working, it's much more
reliable anyway :)
