<PRE>There are a few things to notice when extending unicode data.

MS have (or used to on 2.0) a lot of broken stuff when it comes to
unicode/locales.
So sometimes fixing for MS compatibility means breaking correctness.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm the author (of a large part) of the current Char class and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unfortunately I think you overlooked some things with the changes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What you are doing is (heavily) degrading the performance of most of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the char methods (some of which are VERY commonly used) for supporting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a single (likely VERY rarely used case) in a single (likely not used
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very much) method.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the feedback.  You are completely right: we were discussing
</I>&gt;<i> access times to the packed data, and I got sidetracked into measuring
</I>&gt;<i> that, mistakenly assuming these accesses would still be inlined in the
</I>&gt;<i> interesting cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I now had a look at the disassembly (better late than never), which is a
</I>&gt;<i> bit sobering.  Thanks for the sanity check!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Lets first start with performance. Unfortunately your micro
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; benchmark is completely omitting the most important speed factor: All
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the methods were designed to be inlinable (because they tend to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; called in tight loops, as they are even within corelib). After your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; change likely most/none of them would be inlinable anymore. Your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; benchmark, however, does not CALL A SINGLE METHOD. It just measures
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the overhead of two additional mathematical operators and a memory
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; access. That is not the big speed-sink. But even then your approach
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; looses 25% perf for no additional gain. The original implementation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was the result of (literally) thousands of performance tests.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Heh.  Ironically, I introduced the testing method to *avoid* measuring
</I>&gt;<i> function call overhead&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My initial iteration (in Bugzilla) was trying to take advantage of the
</I>&gt;<i> initial linear portion of the table, but the conditional function call
</I>&gt;<i> would probably also result in the method not being inlineable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. Gain vs. impact. I don't see much sense in changing lots of methods
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in Char to something worse just to support one corner case that could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be handled separately.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another goal of my approach was to support multiple variants of the
</I>&gt;<i> database while still sharing identical pages.  Maybe I should punt on
</I>&gt;<i> that, either by only supporting v2.0&#8211;3.5 or by including multiple flat
</I>&gt;<i> tables (which shouldn't be faulted in if not used).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. Imho the alternative is relatively simple: Just leave the Char
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; methods as they are and add the special casing only for the one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; relevant method. You could just add another table (or two for bi-level
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; table compression or one that reuses the data from the first table) as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a separate entity. So you can leave all the original methods intact
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and ONLY if somebody really uses that method and ONLY if he uses it to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; query the astral plane using surrogates he actually has to pay the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; price for it (in the runtime loading the relevant table into memory
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and using that additional lookup).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I just implemented such a solution, and quickly measured its performance
</I>&gt;<i> with the attached microbenchmark (feel free to point me to a more
</I>&gt;<i> representative test suite if you have one at hand).  On this (x86-64)
</I>&gt;<i> computer, it (unsurprisingly) results in the same numbers as the
</I>&gt;<i> unpached version:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> $ time mono -O=all CharMicrobenchs.exe --load /tmp/mono.txt --repeat 5000
</I>&gt;<i> --run
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - Original Mono: 10.5s;
</I>&gt;<i>  - Bi-level table: 15.6s;
</I>&gt;<i>  - Linear + bi-level table: 10.5s.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Run a few times; jitter is minimal.  Mono.txt is a lynx dump of
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono-Projekt.">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono-Projekt.</A>)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This approach grows the category data table from 64 to ~70kB, and
</I>&gt;<i> requires an additional 8kB index for the astral planes.  The resulting
</I>&gt;<i> runtime produces the same results as Microsoft's v2.0.50727 and
</I>&gt;<i> v3.5.21022 for the whole Unicode range, but has no support for v4.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would that be an acceptable overhead?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would supporting v4.0.30319 be worth it at an additional cost of ~78kB
</I>&gt;<i> of data (which shouldn't be faulted in) in the Mono binary?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Further comments are of course welcome.  I will prepare a new series of
</I>&gt;<i> patches in the near future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Happy hacking
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Andreas
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; P.S. And sorry for being somewhat harsh on the patches.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Heh.  That's what I get for cutting corners ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Damien
