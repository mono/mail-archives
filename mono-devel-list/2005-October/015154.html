<PRE>I have been trying, with little success, to work out how to pass a 
struct from
C# into a C routine that has been registered with mono_add_internal_call().

Specifically, the struct has to be modified within the C routine and those
changes need to be reflected back into the managed C# struct.

I assumed, probably incorrectly, that the standard P/Invoke mechanisms
would be appropriate, and with the C# code using a ref modifier it appears
as if the structure is being sent into the C routine properly, but the 
modified
struct is not being copied back into the C# side at all.

Is there any particular magic that is required with internal calls with 
an embedded
application to get the copy in/copy out mechanism to work correctly?

Yours in desperation.
