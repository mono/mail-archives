This is what I am considering right now too... But before I do, I
thought I would share this....

i have various unpredictable &quot;service unavailable&quot; errors and hangs as
well since upgrading to 1.1.9.2 this morning (on SuSE 9.3). i noticed
this in the error_log after several crashes:

*** glibc detected *** malloc(): memory corruption: 0x09179018 ***

but this message is not consistently reproducible. i had a page that
would reproduce the error consistently but when i extracted the
implementation into a single executable (it was just an IHttpHandler
class that resized images), the problem went away. 

so, i created a bare-bones version of the IHttpHandler that will
reproduce the problem. it is attached to this email - you will need a
version of GD installed as well (i have &quot;gd-2.0.32-6&quot;); the .NET wrapper
for GD is include in the bin/ directory. a simple makefile for the
sample is included. 

interestingly, the crash it seems to be dependent on the size of the
previews I am generating:

below, the first request (and all requests for images of type &quot;Preview&quot;)
succeeds, the second (and all requests for images of type &quot;LargeFormat&quot;)
fail consistently. the large format is a 1024x768 image.

127.0.0.1 - - [09/Oct/2005:22:02:44 +0200]
&quot;GET /gd-gallery/GDImage.ashx?fmt=Preview&amp;img=%2fdata%2fimages%

To test it, you need to pass the path to a jpeg file that the web server
process can read as the &quot;img&quot; parameter. i am testing with 4 megapixel
files, so you might try using a similarly large one...

the &quot;fmt&quot; parameter is the resize format: &quot;fmt=LargeFormat&quot; seems to
cause trouble for me.

Sample:
<A HREF="http://localhost/simpleimage/SimpleImage.ashx?img=%2fdata%2fimages%">http://localhost/simpleimage/SimpleImage.ashx?img=%2fdata%2fimages%</A>
2fimg_5084.jpg&amp;fmt=LargeFormat

&gt;<i> Blegh.
</I>Blegh indeed.

Kind Regards,

ps: possibly related: for a while now (since 1.1.8?), I have been seeing
sessions become quickly invalid and am not sure why: i log into blogx to
post something and before i am done with the post (ok, i write slow but
not THAT slow!) I get an access denied error and need to log in again...
wierd... and that (as with the code from above) has been working for
ages, like since 0.30 or so, so I don't think it is the application...
