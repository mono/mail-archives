</I>Correct.  I was the one that always moved them from bin directory to the 
lib directory.  This I would do to keep only the shell scripts and batch 
files  in the bin directory and all exe(s) in the lib directory so that 
they would reside with the unmanaged dll(s) that the build process 
creates as a bi-product of its running.

Again, don't take this as me saying that there should be a move. I am 
just saying that after more than a year of doing all the builds and the 
post build integration testing I had things the way I did because it 
seem to work best.  However, all the recent buzz in the list over the 
Windows installer probably translates to a lot more help from a lot more 
qualified people and it will probably lead to the best automated and 
reproducible build process -- that is a good thing!

A lot of the decisions I made in my build procedure were done so that I 
could use the *NIX build process without any alteration while building 
in Windows.
