<PRE>For now I could use GTK + X11 on the Mac, from what I understand. The
problem is that, even themed, GTK+ just doesn't have that completely native
look &amp; feel. This is just my opinion, and I'm picky when it comes to UIs 8-)
(See <A HREF="http://themes.freshmeat.net/screenshots/31431/33291/,">http://themes.freshmeat.net/screenshots/31431/33291/,</A> for example).

The whole native-vs-emulated cross-platform UI framework is an interesting
topic. 8 or 9 years ago, I was deciding between an emulated framework called
Galaxy, and a native one called XVT. Today, it seems we have the same
choices.

The sad thing is, and I raise it only for the sake of discussion, is that I
may port my app to Java 5 / SWT. The existence of a first class development
platform (Eclipse), and the fact that Java 5 has caught up to C# in many
ways, makes it a compelling choice.

I love Mono and C#, which is why the decision is so hard!

&gt;<i> i am waiting for that gtk port to MacOS ...  in the mean time ..
</I>&gt;<i> I am using  WX.Wigets (wx.net) which is native on linux,mac, 
</I>&gt;<i> and win32 its not nearly as powerful as using gtk+ direct,
