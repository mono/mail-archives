&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I've personally found this workflow to be a lot of extra work for

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We've already seen issues with unintended (but safe) merges causing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> confusion -- the confusion is exacerbated by the GitHub UI showing 'git
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> diff --first-parent' on merge commits, rather than something more symmetric.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>[snip]
&gt;<i> However, it's just so easy to do this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     git checkout master
</I>&gt;<i>       # do stuff
</I>&gt;<i>     git commit -a
</I>&gt;<i>     git pull
</I>&gt;<i>     git push
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That I think asking people to do fancier stuff is kind of cruel most
</I>&gt;<i> of the time.
</I>
I agree, but that also led us to:

  <A HREF="http://mono-project.com/GitFAQ#When_I_commit.2C_my_commit_.22repeats.22_commits_of_other_people">http://mono-project.com/GitFAQ#When_I_commit.2C_my_commit_.22repeats.22_commits_of_other_people</A>

&gt;<i> If you wanted to really get fancy, you would have a single mainline
</I>&gt;<i> I noticed when I first started to use git that there's an unreasonable
</I>&gt;<i> tendency to try to make the history graphs (or in your case, github
</I>&gt;<i> output) look pretty.
</I>
The parenthetical is the first point I disagree with you on.  I don't
particularly care :-)  Otherwise, we agree violently, it seems.

&gt;<i> I learned that it's really just a waste of time, because the history
</I>&gt;<i> graphs really aren't that useful to humans, and git itself doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> care if they're pretty.  It's much better to ignore them and get along
</I>&gt;<i> with work.
</I>
If you have to a bone to pick with me, it should be for me being too
reluctant to replace the answer above with

  &quot;They are merge commits.  Git has them.  Github screws up when it
  displays them.  Nothing to see, move along&quot;

and, maybe, that I said

  &quot;Here's this nice branch-based workflow&quot;

in the original mail.  Okay, suggestion 3 is out :-)
