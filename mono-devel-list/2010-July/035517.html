One might not like dealing with extra remotes, but that would be a burnen only to mantainers  merging code from contributors.

Miguel has agreed with my suggestion, so I'll document this in more detail on the workflow changes page after dinner.

&gt;<i> I have another proposition to make. Can we stop using Changelog files? Those can be generated from the commit logs for tarballs and releases without losing anything at all. Commit messages would still have to be at least as informative as they currently are.

</I>&gt;<i> Not having Changelog files resolve 90%+ of our sources of conflicts and make the forkqueue much more useful. If we are to move to a DVCS style of development, this will be a big barrier otherwise.
</I>
I strongly support this as well, but in fact I'd like to suggest that we all strive to do a better job of commit messages.  I'm guilty of this as much as anyone, but we have a lot of things that say &quot;Fix bla&quot;; without describing why its broken, or what the fix is.
