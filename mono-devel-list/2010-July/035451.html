<PRE>The first problem this is trying to address is precisely that we are running Mono now on four configurations that have no dynamic linker.   All they offer is a static linked image.

The second problem is that this solves is allowing us to statically link existing libraries that have existing invoke bindings without having to modify the c# code every time we port a library (for example, we keep dllimport &quot;Cairo&quot; in the source).

I don't particularly care about the implementation details, but the two scenarios above need to be supported.      We can deal with some adjustments in the four ports with the c API, but the __internal stuff is just not going to work.

Miguel.
