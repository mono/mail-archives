It was published in the 2.6 headers, though the actual functionality
did not work in normal builds.

</I>&gt;<i> But it does change the code to fallback and you want to publish the API,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's meant to provide an easy way to P/Invoke statically linked

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dynamic linkers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you have a working dynamic linker using DllImport (&quot;__Internal&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> is the way to go.
</I>
Only if your dynamic linker supports looking up symbols in
&quot;__Internal&quot; (NULL). The Android one does not, and if you have non-PIC
static libraries the Windows one does not either.

&gt;&gt;<i> That's certainly more flexible, but I'm not convinced it's necessary

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you don't have concrete cases, why are you expanding the
</I>&gt;<i> functionality of the quick and dirty (and non-public) API?
</I>
I did describe a concrete use case for my solution - being able to
P/Invoke static libraries on the aforementioned major platforms.
Without my patch this is currently impossible. I have been using it
for this just fine.

Your solution is a more cumbersome solution for my problem, and does
not solve other concrete use cases.

&gt;&gt;<i> old interface anyway - else we make embedders responsible for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reimplementing its functionality - then why not go this path for now,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and reimplement it on top of the callbacks later?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because it means exposing an API and attaching to it functionality it's not
</I>&gt;<i> suited for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The tricks you mention could be much more useful if callbacks could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> intercept lookups for individual symbols, rather than acting as a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fallback for handling whole libraries. But this would require much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more substantial changes to the dynamic linker code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A separate API entry point could be added for that.
</I>&gt;<i> To recap:
</I>&gt;<i> *) that API was never public.
</I>&gt;<i> *) I'm not comfortable with publishing that API and supporting it
</I>&gt;<i> with the fallback functionality.
</I>&gt;<i> *) if we need a fallback mechanism something like my proposed
</I>&gt;<i> interface is much better and I think is suitable for publishing
</I>&gt;<i> (maybe with an additional flags value to give a priority vs the
</I>&gt;<i> existing lookups).
</I>
Maybe, but my patch exists, and cleanly repurposes existing
functionality to fix an existing limitation.

Implementing your proposed solution properly (especially with symbol
granularity rather than library granularity) would require a much more
substantial amount of work.
