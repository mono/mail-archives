The interface was just a quick hack from Miguel, in fact is has never
been exposed as public API as you found out (it was only possible to use
it in a custom mono build for consoles).
If you have a tool generating the table now, changing it to generate
the function needed by the new interface should be trivial, anyway.

&gt;<i> My patch isn't intended to provide a generic dynamic linker fallback.
</I>
But it does change the code to fallback and you want to publish the API,
so then we're stuck with an unsuitable API for a new feature.

&gt;<i> It's meant to provide an easy way to P/Invoke statically linked

</I>
If you have a working dynamic linker using DllImport (&quot;__Internal&quot;)
is the way to go.

If you don't have concrete cases, why are you expanding the
functionality of the quick and dirty (and non-public) API?

&gt;<i> old interface anyway - else we make embedders responsible for
</I>&gt;<i> reimplementing its functionality - then why not go this path for now,
</I>&gt;<i> and reimplement it on top of the callbacks later?
</I>
Because it means exposing an API and attaching to it functionality it's not
suited for.

&gt;<i> The tricks you mention could be much more useful if callbacks could

</I>&gt;<i> fallback for handling whole libraries. But this would require much

</I>
A separate API entry point could be added for that.
To recap:
*) that API was never public.
*) I'm not comfortable with publishing that API and supporting it
with the fallback functionality.
*) if we need a fallback mechanism something like my proposed
interface is much better and I think is suitable for publishing
(maybe with an additional flags value to give a priority vs the
existing lookups).
