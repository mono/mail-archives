I think before there was github, it was pretty common (and mostly
harmless) for people to put username/* branches into the shared repo
so they wouldn't get lost.  Certainly we do this at some of our
internal-only servers at work.  In theory, someone other than jfrisby
could push to a jfrisby/* branch, but in practice that never actually
happens.

With github, I think they just cleaned up the model a bit so you now
have a guarantee that nobody but jfrisby is messing with the jfrisby
repo.  I doubt it affects collaboration that much; if I download the
mono/mono repo, I'm probably not going to go digging around in the
sub-branches anyway unless I'm specifically directed to.

Have fun,

Avery
