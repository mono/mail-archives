<PRE>If there's a problem with Wine's gdiplus, it should be fixed in Wine.

I would be very surprised if cairo on Windows uses gdiplus. All the
evidence I've seen shows that gdiplus on Windows does everything in
software, and cairo's software rendering is probably better.

&gt;&gt;<i> 3. As both wine and mono implements he same C Flat API as the GDIPLUS.DLL.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can we use mono's libgdiplus tho replace wine's?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe, I don't know enough about wine to tell you how exhaustive the
</I>&gt;<i> change would need to be.
</I>
The best way would be to build a gdiplus.dll that works on Windows. It
could then be used in Wine as well.

To build it as a winelib dll (using the native cairo instead of a
Windows build of cairo), you'd need to use some special commands to
get things like X drawables from gdi32 handles, and you'd have to
provide a software fallback in case X drawables don't exist. That
said, bypassing the Windows API layers and accessing X resources
directly may break some things.
