<PRE>No. Because sorting could happen a lot.

Also, your patch brings wrong assumption that every XslTransform
must be immutable, even when msxsl:script is involved (and I don't
think we welcome &quot;x is thread safe&quot; &quot;y is not&quot; sort of complication).

You are anyways standing on wrong premise anyways. Create multiple
XslTransform for each thread. Since newobj happens a lot, it shouldn't
be a big problem (for you at least).
