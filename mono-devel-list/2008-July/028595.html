True, but it would allow unknown blocks, both now (if I &quot;forget&quot; to
modify some call to pass the enum) and most important in the future,
when new calls to mono_code_manager_reserve will be added.

And it would make me add new function names for the &quot;extended API (like
&quot;&#65279;mono_code_manager_reserve_with_id&quot;) instead of reusing the current
ones, &quot;growing&quot; the API.

That said, yes, this is doable and would be anyway better than
scattering lots of explicit calls to the profiler API everywhere.

Yes, I know... I am tempted to put &quot;additional information&quot; besides the
enum, like a MonoClass* or MonoMethod*, so one can have more detailed
information (like &quot;IMT thunk for class X&quot;).
It would not be difficult, just a bit more work (quite honestly, the
&quot;hardest&quot; part of the work is just going through the thunk types one by
one and decide what info one can put there exactly, like &quot;specific
trampoline for method X&quot;, or &quot;general method trampoline&quot;...).

The run time overhead would not be noticeable, so If we think it would
be nice to have this kind of info I can do it.
It smells a bit of overengineering, but it's hard for me to judge it.

&gt;<i> On the other

</I>
Also true.

&gt;<i> I believe that using an enum is enough for all use cases I have, as

/me too

Ciao,
