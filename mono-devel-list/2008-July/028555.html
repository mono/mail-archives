What I said wrong here is MSDN documentation, not API (and yes as you
say, I don't think differentiating them here is very productive).

&gt;<i> yes. But if it's inconsistent, that doesn't tell you which way to

So it falls back to my second reply: I don't think we welcome &quot;x is 
thread safe&quot; &quot;y is not&quot; sort of complication. (And I don't forget
the performance issue in your change yet.)
