<PRE>Hi guys,

I'm currently talking with schani in #monodev about implementing
generics sharing in the debugger.

The good news is, it looks like it's possible to do that.

However, it won't work without doing some substantial changes to the
runtime &lt;-&gt; debugger interface.  My understanding was that we were
branching on July 14th (ie. yesterday) and that everything has to be
done by then.  That's exactly why I decided against implementing
generics sharing in the debugger last week.

So here's the deal:

If we want generics sharing in the debugger, I request permission to
break the runtime &lt;-&gt; debugger interface as many times as I want until
Mono 2.0 RC1 (August 4th).  After that - until RC2 (August 18th) - the
runtime &lt;-&gt; debugger interface may still change, but only if critical
bugs require it.

My current understanding is, that to support generics sharing in the
debugger, I'd need to modify the way how things are stored in the
debugger's symbol table.  Getting the code done shouldn't take more than
3-5 days, but unfortunately, it would touch a core piece of the
debugger, so I have to insist on getting a 3-week testing period.

&gt;<i>From my point of view, I'm a lot more concerned about stability than
</I>getting the feature in.  That's also the reason why I want the 3-week
testing period.

Alternatively, we could also postpone generics sharing in the debugger
and implement it for the next release.
