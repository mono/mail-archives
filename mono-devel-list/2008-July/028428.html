I /believe/ that Silverlight/Moonlight can do RTSP and RSTPT (and
obviously MMS), but I'm not 100% sure. I don't know too much about the
protocols but at one point I was helping out with the media streaming
code and noticed code to handle those 2 protocol schemes (although it's
possible that the code just did immediate fallback to http or something,
I can't remember).

Hopefully one of the moonlight media people can answer this more
accurately.

However, in the end, if you aren't happy with the codecs that
Silverlight supports, then even if we add support for your preferred
codec into Moonlight, it wouldn't solve your codec problem.

Out of curiosity, which codec do you plan on using?

Jeff
