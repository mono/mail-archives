Well, sure. There's lots a script can do to mess up the application, and 
it seems like scripts in transformations basically need full trust 
anyway because at the least they can go into an infinite loop and stop 
the thread. And if they need full trust, the application writer can make 
thread safety judgments based on his knowledge of the script.

 &gt; If MSDN says it is thread safe for transformation, then that is wrong.
 &gt; If it were correct, it requires whatever no one can achieve.

Not to go all semantics on you, but an API can't be wrong. Inconsistent, 
yes. But if it's inconsistent, that doesn't tell you which way to 
resolve the inconsistency. It seems perfectly sensible to resolve the 
inconsistency by saying &quot;so long as any scripts and extension functions 
are also thread safe&quot;.
