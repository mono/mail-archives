<PRE>Hello,

Here are some data which hopefully bring some light to this topic. I 
didn't measure uniqueness of hashcodes as I consider it less important 
as range distribution. Enclosed you can find the result for you data 
with old and new string.GetHashCode implementation.

Some numbers to look at:

** Old implementation

Highest contentions: 2985, 1155, 1137

** Current implementation

Highest contentions: 236, 217, 210

&gt;<i> I have been asked to move this discussion to the e-mail list from IRC.
</I>&gt;<i>  Basically we (my company and I) have new unit tests errors in 2.0
</I>&gt;<i> that did not occur at 1.9.  The errors were traced to the
</I>&gt;<i> String.GetHashCode change.  I had one of our interns (Mike) research
</I>&gt;<i> the change and I wanted to share his findings with you.  His final
</I>&gt;<i> document s attached.  I can also send the test case Mike used to
</I>&gt;<i> generate his data.  I believe it is too large to send to all of your
</I>&gt;<i> inboxes.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (1:28:15 PM) holmes: Have there been any discussions about r106887
</I>&gt;<i> which was a change to String.GetHashCode?
</I>&gt;<i> (1:31:54 PM) holmes: This change is causing some of our tests to fail.
</I>&gt;<i>  I will admit that our tests are relying on the sting hash code a bit
</I>&gt;<i> too much.  However after some investigation I am wondering if the new
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm is generating a unique enough result.  (I say that as
</I>&gt;<i> respectfully as I can.)
</I>&gt;<i> (1:34:33 PM) holmes: We conducted a short test where 58000 English
</I>&gt;<i> string were tested and the new code only results in 60% unique results
</I>&gt;<i> compared to the previous code's performance of 100%
</I>&gt;<i> (1:38:36 PM) holmes: We have found the current algorithm only
</I>&gt;<i> considers the last ~6 characters of a string, which may be the
</I>&gt;<i> problem.  That is the last thing I will say here I promise.
</I>&gt;<i> (1:42:21 PM) kumpera: marek: how have you tested the distribution of
</I>&gt;<i> your new string hashing algorithm?
</I>&gt;<i> (1:42:54 PM) marek: kumpera: I used english dictionary
</I>&gt;<i> (1:43:57 PM) marek: holmes: how big is your dictionary?
</I>&gt;<i> (1:45:05 PM) holmes: marek: 58110
</I>&gt;<i> (1:46:12 PM) holmes: I think the real problem is not that a word
</I>&gt;<i> hashes unique enough as a sentence producing a unique result.
</I>&gt;<i> (1:46:56 PM) holmes: the last 6 characters define the whole algorithm.
</I>&gt;<i>  (or at least I think so)
</I>&gt;<i> (1:56:50 PM) lupus: it's likely better to revert the change, string
</I>&gt;<i> hashing is also supposed to be synced with the implementation in C in
</I>&gt;<i> the runtime anyway
