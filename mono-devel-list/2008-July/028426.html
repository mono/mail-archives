<PRE>Hi everybody,

I am about to choose the technology that will be used during the next
two years to build the ESOF2010 web site (if you're curious about ESOF
just check this year website, <A HREF="http://www.esof2008.org/">http://www.esof2008.org/</A>). The project for
2010 includes a lot of streaming using preferably open protocols and
open source software (mandatory on the servers, the client code should
work at least on Windows and Linux and may use proprietary plugins). The
tools to create the streams should be free software.

We choosed to use feng as the streaming server because it supports
RTP/RTSP and RTMP (now mostly free) with fallback on HTTP encapsulation
and a lot of different non-proprietary codecs. 

Looking at MS website for Silverlight specifications it seems to me that
streaming using the standard protocols cited above is not supported and
that only MS codecs (that we don't like to use) can be used. We also
investigated the possibility of writing a a managed RTP implementation
but it seems that UDP is not supported in Silverlight. And even if we
manage to have a working implementation of RTP it is not clear how you
can decode the data and send it to the multimedia part of the framework.

So it seems that while we would much better like to work with
Mono/Moonlight and keep compatibility with Silverlight in the end will
be forced to use Adobe Flash (RTMP + one of the non-free codecs: at
least there are open source tools to do the authoring and the encoding
conversions).

I am writing to this list because I _hope_ we missed something and that
Silverlight/Moonlight can be used to play streams using open protocols
and codecs.

Thank you for your time,
federico
