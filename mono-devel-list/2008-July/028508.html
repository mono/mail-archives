That's also my preferred solution - I am really worried about making
changes now which could potentially destabilize the debugger.  I am also
scared about getting a bug report in 2-3 weeks which will force me to
break compatibility again.

&gt;<i> For 2.1 we should of course implement debugging with generic code sharing.

Yeah, exactly.

As I already said in my last mail, it looks like getting the code done
isn't that much work (I was wrong about that last week), it's just that
it'll need some extensive testing and we may not know what the problems
are before we run into them.
