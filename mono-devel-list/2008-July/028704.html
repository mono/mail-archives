<PRE>Starting with Mono 2.0, we are switching to a new version scheme for
Mono releases:

MAJOR.MINOR.SUBRELEASE

Even minor releases are stable releases, while odd releases are unstable
releases, they are typically used during development and is contained as
part of the code that is only checked in on subversion or that is
available as part of the daily builds. 

The subrelease indicates a minor release or an update to a specific
release.

Notice that before Mono 2.0 these rules did not apply and every public
release version that was available was a stable release (1.9, 1.9.1,
1.2.6, 1.2.6.1 and so on).

So after Mono 2.0 is released what will happen is code checked into SVN
will become Mono 2.1.xx, and just before the release we will change that
to Mono 2.2.

Our themes for the releases is documented here:

	<A HREF="http://mono-project.com/Mono_Project_Roadmap#Themes">http://mono-project.com/Mono_Project_Roadmap#Themes</A>

Our plans right now call for 2.2, 2.4, 2.6 and 2.8 major releases.

Miguel.

</PRE>
