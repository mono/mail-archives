<PRE>Okay, so, clearly I'm only writing more because it makes my life easier 
to have the patch in, and not because I particularly care about API 
compatibility...

The MSDN docs for System.Xml.Xsl.XslTransform say &quot;XslTransform objects 
are only thread-safe for transform operations,&quot; which implies they are 
intended to be thread safe in the manner I suggested. (I didn't mention 
this initially because the docs for the Transform method don't mention 
anything about thread safety so I didn't think it was a part of the API. 
But I thought that it was suspicious because it is an obvious candidate 
for a thread-safe method, so I checked again.)

I'm not sure how msxsl:script works or why it would be a problem...?
