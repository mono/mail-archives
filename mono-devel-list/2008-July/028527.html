&gt;<i> I've been tracking the SVN sources of mono and MonoDevelop, and I'm
</I>&gt;<i> especially interested in the debugger support in MonoDevelop, and had
</I>&gt;<i> some questions about it:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's clearly still in development, but what are the plans and timeline?
</I>
The plan is to release it with MonoDevelop 2.0 around the end of the
year. Several alpha and beta releases will be available in the following
months.

&gt;<i> Some of the views that exist now are pretty neat, but what about things
</I>&gt;<i> like, say, visually inspecting variables while debugging, 
</I>
You can already do that.

&gt;<i> or other
</I>&gt;<i> features otherwise hidden in the GUI version? Is there some kind of TODO
</I>&gt;<i> list, or some obvious things that need to be implemented? I'm
</I>&gt;<i> specifically interested in things that I could pick up and start working
</I>&gt;<i> on, fwiw.
</I>
The debugger integration is being done by me and by Alfonso Santos (GSOC
student). Right now, no additional help is needed in this area.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Adding breakpoints to files in assemblies other than the main assembly
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't work, e.g., if a solution contains a support library foo.dll for
</I>&gt;<i> bar.exe, and I try adding a breakpoint to a file in foo.dll, the
</I>&gt;<i> debugger can't resolve that file, apparently because foo.dll isn't
</I>&gt;<i> loaded at that point.
</I>
That's not supported yet, but planned.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Starting up a program under the debugger takes a fairly long time, and
</I>&gt;<i> there's no feedback that things are happening during this process.
</I>
How much is &quot;fairly long time&quot;? It takes like 2 seconds here. This is
normal, although it can be improved.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What key is &quot;L1&quot;? It's bound to the step commands, but I have no idea
</I>&gt;<i> what key that corresponds to.
</I>
F11, Michael explained the problem with it. We have to fix that.

Lluis.
