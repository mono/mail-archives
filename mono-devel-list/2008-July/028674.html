<PRE>Hi Korn&#233;l,
&gt;<i>From your email the advantage of the patch is that by replacing some icalls
</I>with managed code we would get rid of some managed-native transitions.

But there are some side effects:

-It makes the new full AOT mode a bit more complicated as these would be
another
kind of wrappers that would need to be AOT'ed.

-Increases the footprint by just a bit, as we need to store the icalls
internal representation
as well. The amount of extra code generated is bounded, specially since we
replace a
managed-to-native wrapper with a managed-to-managed with more code.

-JIT time should not change much, but this is only a guess.

I wonder if it is really an advantage of following this patch as, for
example, OffsetToStringData
has 22 lines in your patch but 6 in the current setup. Of course the code in
your patch ends more
organized and I find it easier to follow, but should be interesting to rear
from the others.

Anyway, I think this patch is interesting, but here are my concerns:

-For simple methods such as OffsetToStringData the method call overhead
might be a killer. We
should make sure that these new wrappers get a change to be inlined.

-Does it work under trunk?

-Do you have performance numbers on your change? Since it changes
performance sensitive
parts of the runtime, attaching a benchmark (or pointing to an existing one)
showing the implications is
fundamental.

-I'm not aware of how stack traces behave with wrappers, but are they
preserved with your patch?

Thanks,
Rodrigo
