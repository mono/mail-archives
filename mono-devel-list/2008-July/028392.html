<PRE>Hi,

I know from my own experience that if two of us have a debate about 
something it's quite easy to take it personally but the other people 
just don't interfere because they know that this isn't really about 
personal insults.

Anyway the problem that appears time to time is whether we should be 
100% MS.NET compatible or should produce software that is superior to 
MS.NET even at the cost of incompatibility.

Compatibility means functional compatibility not just implementing what 
is documented. And I think that this is what Gert tried to do.

On the other hand - as I see - you defend that Mono is independent 
software that should function correctly.

This latter point of view would be the best choice but Microsoft usually 
closes their bugs as &quot;this is by design&quot; or &quot;we don't want to change 
this in the near future&quot; so even if we correct bugs MS.NET will remain 
incompatible.

MS.NET compatibility is one of our highest priority tasks but is a very 
difficult question but I think we still have no policy regarding MS.NET 
compatibility.
