If I got you correct, then msxsl:script is the only problem with  
thread safety? Since it's a Microsoft extension I don't think many  
stylesheets use it, and those that do &quot;should&quot; be aware of concurrency  
issues. It's a relatively common pattern in J2EE to preload a  
stylesheet and to have a servlet's request workers do the transform  
asynchronously, relying on thread safety. Therefore interpreting the  
MSDN docs in the way proposed by Joshua would make sense, and I don't  
think we even have to spell out the &quot;unless you do something stupid&quot;  
part for that.

Performance is a different matter of course.
