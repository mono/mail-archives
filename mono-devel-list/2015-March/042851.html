<PRE>Hi all,  

First of all, I would like to thank you all who are interested in working with us on the Mono project for the Google Summer of Code 2015. I will be the Mono organization member that will help you with the integration of the code recently open sourced by Microsoft, into the Mono project.



As you may have noticed the amount of code that was released by Microsoft is enormous, meaning that there is a lot of topic to choose from. This means that the topic you will work on, depends greatly on what you are interested in. Some integration works will be easier than others because of, for example, the absence of dependence on the CoreCLR runtime or on external dependencies.

As described on the Mono project website (<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/community/google-summer-of-code/projects/#microsoft-net-and-mono-integration">http://www.mono-project.com/community/google-summer-of-code/projects/#microsoft-net-and-mono-integration</A>), the integration work can be divided in two big parts :
Integrating Microsoft Reference Source to Mono BCL (Base Class Library)
Port Microsoft CoreCLR features to Mono runtime

You can find the current list of ideas on our Trello board, that we will use across all of the GSoC, here : <A HREF="https://trello.com/b/vRPTMfdz/net-framework-integration-into-mono">https://trello.com/b/vRPTMfdz/net-framework-integration-into-mono</A>

Integrating Microsoft Reference Source

This task mainly requires some basic C# knowledge. It consist in integrating Microsoft Reference Source into Mono Class Libraries. Some of the assemblies and tooling left to merge are the following :
System.Activities
System.IdentityModel
System.Runtime
System.ServiceModel
System.Workflow
System.Xaml.Hosting
System.Data
Code Contracts

Port Microsoft CoreCLR features to Mono runtime


This task requires deeper C# knowledge as well as good C and C++ knowledge. It is also harder than the previous one because of the complexity of the implementation of a runtime.  

The kind of project you will work on depends more on your interest. One of the topic that would be interesting to work on is the integration of the CoreCLR GC into Mono. Mono already has a common API to implement for each GC that we want to integrate (Boehm and SGen), so it would &#8220;simply&#8221; consist in implementing this API in the CoreCLR GC. This is a pretty complicated as every GC have their own internal APIs and their own assumptions that the runtime has to comply with.


Questions?

So if you are interested in any of these subjects, do not hesitate to contact me via email, on this mailing list or to my Xamarin email address, I will be happy to answer you. Also if you would like to work on something else that is not in the Trello board or in this email, please contact me with your idea, and I will be happy to discuss it with you.

Thank you all very much,

--  
Ludovic Henry
