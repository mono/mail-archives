<PRE>Hi,

I'm currently having an issue with building mono 1.2.3.1 on Solaris 10
06/06 on SPARC. The build process gets as far as executing the mcs
compiler where the mono runtime crashes with a segmentation fault.

How I'm building it:

export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/sfw/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:/usr/bin
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/mono/lib/pkgconfig
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/mono/lib:/usr/local/lib

./configure --prefix=&quot;/opt/mono&quot;
gmake get-monolite-latest
gmake

To compile it I'm using gcc 3.4.4 which I've installed in
/usr/local/bin. I've compiled my own copy of glib2 (2.12.11) into
/opt/mono. I've attached logs from configure and make in case these
are of any use.

I took a stack trace from the crashed process and it receives the
signal in GC_read_dirty() when it initialises the garbage collector.

Has anyone seen this problem before? Is there a flag or option that
needs to be set when building on Solaris?

Thanks,


Iain
