<PRE>Hello,

Knowing this previously would have helped ;-). I have got conflicting advice
in the past about whether glib or eglib would be the best approach.

In addition, eglib is such a small library that am curious as to what
&gt;<i> you think would require all that work to port eglib to Win64, it does
</I>&gt;<i> not seem that difficult, and the code base is very small.
</I>

I'll look at the progress I made previously locally. I think the biggest
issues were msvc issues like handling varargs differently than gcc (adding a
decent number of #ifdefs), and lots of string conversions between Windows
API (Unicode) and glib (utf-8). I'm willing to work on this again, with help
from anyone else, if this is the future direction of mono.

Miguel.



Thanks,
Jonathan
