Sure, that's a good reason for the European commission to investigate
why they still adopt anti-competitive practices. If they do jitting,
other people developing for the platform should be allowed to have the
info do it as well. Hopefully the game industry will pressure them as
well.

There is definitely interest and it is likely possible to make it work
using the AOT backend and the PE file converter you mentioned, so I
don't think the changes are pointless: they will enable other interested
people to help you with your efforts. If you have other reasons that
prevent you from contributing the code that's understandable.

I'll review it in a bit, I was on vacation the last few days.

&gt;<i> Nevertheless, if it never happens, I might drop the sources of that prototype as

Did you check the mono*describe* functions in
metadata/class-internals.h?
