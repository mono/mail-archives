I've made the last few commits to this module, and am pretty familiar 
with it by now. Gonzalo wrote some lovely code.

I think I might be able to maintain it, but there are some things I'd 
want to do before committing to a long-term ABI guarantee for the GAC:

  * Consider using SecureString for authentication tokens. Even if this 
class isn't yet &quot;secure&quot; in Mono (I have an implementation in the works, 
need to check with Seb), I wouldn't be comfortable being responsible for 
a library that knowingly stores critical data cleartext in the heap.

  * Make sure all implementation details are internal.

  * Check with the C gnome keyring implementation to see if there have 
been additions/deprecations since Gnome.Keyring was written.

  * Try to get a public API review from the C gnome keyring authors.
