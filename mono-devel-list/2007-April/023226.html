More and more of ASP.NET 2.0 is present and available.  The rest of the
2.0 framework methods are more iffy -- for example, System.Windows.Forms
2.0 isn't close to finished.

&gt;<i> It seems that master pages are there...or not?

I believe they are.

&gt;<i> If I've a software that runs in 1.1 framework and I compile it with

</I>
It should.  However, some methods were marked as [Obsolete] between the
1.0 and 2.0 profiles, the exceptions generated by some methods have
changed...  Most of this is for compatibility with .NET 2.0.

For example, System.IO.File.GetCreationTime(string) returns a &quot;default&quot;
FileTime of DateTime(1601,1,1) if the path doesn't exist, while 1.0
would throw an IOException.  (Why Microsoft made this change, I couldn't
tell you.)

So some behaviors *will* differ between the 1.0 and 2.0 profiles, but in
each instance Mono attempts to follow .NET behavior as close as
reasonably possible.

&gt;<i> I haven't found nothing about no touch deployment and clickonce 
</I>&gt;<i> deployment, they are present or in plans to be supported?
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks in advance and excuse me for placing already answered questions.
</I>
These have nothing to do with ASP.NET 2.0, but do require Framework 2.0
support.  Both of these require full Code Access Security (CAS) support,
which is still incomplete in Mono, so even if we had ClickOnce
implemented, it would be unsafe to use.
