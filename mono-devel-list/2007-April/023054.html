Ok, I took a look at all that.
There is a tool to convert PE executable (with PPC code) in their .xex format.
However, there were issues :
1/ AOT is working only on x86 right now, according to
<A HREF="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2006/Aug-17.html">http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2006/Aug-17.html</A>
2/ And even if it's ok, the more important problem is that according to the same
post, it still need JIT at some place.
3/ When working on it, I tried to produce PE file with PE PPC Big endian target
with binutils, and it was really painful, it's not really supported anymore (I
speak of PE format only of course, it's well supported in other cases).
