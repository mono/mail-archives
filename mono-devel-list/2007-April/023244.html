<PRE>Hello Paul,

I've dug a little into the KDE screen saver and it seems that he works quite 
different from the way it works on windows.

Windows Invokes the .scr file with different params to either show or 
configure the screen saver, hower KDE uses a QtWidget called KScreenSaver 
which either shows the screen saver or the config dialog wether if it is 
being created with an windowId passed to the constructor or not. (See 
kscreensaver.h in the KDE-include dir)

So it should get a little more tricky than on windows if you try to integrate 
your screensaver to the existing ones. Howerver the KDE manual says the 
following:

= Using a non-KDE screen saver =
KDE does not prevent another screen saver from working. To use a different 
screen saver, such as xscreensaver, simply disable the KDE Screen Saver, and 
set up your other screen saver program normally.

So it should be possible to replace the KDE screensavers completely.

That is what I found out about it, but I can not promise it's correctness 
since my knowledge of KDE and Qt is very very limited.

Kind Regards,
Valentin
