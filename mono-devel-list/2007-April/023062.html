By the way, I sent yesterday a mail to MS in that sense. But well, we all know
how it will end :)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The XBOX360 changes are pointless since it seems not possible to make it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; working.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is definitely interest and it is likely possible to make it work
</I>&gt;<i> using the AOT backend and the PE file converter you mentioned, so I
</I>&gt;<i> don't think the changes are pointless: they will enable other interested
</I>&gt;<i> people to help you with your efforts. If you have other reasons that
</I>&gt;<i> prevent you from contributing the code that's understandable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
No, that's no problem for me to release it (still it would need some polishing
before doing so). However, I also had to port glibc first, so it's kinda messy.
What I dont know is if it's legal to release code using this xdk, since it's not
available for public... (even headers). I'll ask and let you know.

&gt;<i> &gt; About the debugger, it's more a prototype right now, but I will probably
</I>&gt;<i> work on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it again if the code to get my monobind wrapper working is included in mono
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; source tree (I posted the patch at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-devel-list/2007-March/022949.html,">http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-devel-list/2007-March/022949.html,</A> I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dunno if it was the right place for that).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll review it in a bit, I was on vacation the last few days.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Nevertheless, if it never happens, I might drop the sources of that
</I>&gt;<i> prototype as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a base (I nearly managed to do singlestepping and variable inspection with
</I>&gt;<i> class
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; definition extracted from runtime context).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Did you check the mono*describe* functions in
</I>&gt;<i> metadata/class-internals.h?
</I>
Yes, that's what I use if I remember right. Introspection is done with mono api
itself (and that's why it is nice ! ;p).
