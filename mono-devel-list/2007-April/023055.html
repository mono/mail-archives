I think the XBOX 360 CLR runtime does JITing, but well, Microsoft got a better
access to console internal than us.

The XBOX360 changes are pointless since it seems not possible to make it
working.
About the debugger, it's more a prototype right now, but I will probably work on
it again if the code to get my monobind wrapper working is included in mono
source tree (I posted the patch at
<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-devel-list/2007-March/022949.html,">http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-devel-list/2007-March/022949.html,</A> I
dunno if it was the right place for that).
Nevertheless, if it never happens, I might drop the sources of that prototype as
a base (I nearly managed to do singlestepping and variable inspection with class
definition extracted from runtime context).
