It would really be nice !
Don't hesitate to let me know as soon as those two points are done and I'll give
it a try.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3/ When working on it, I tried to produce PE file with PE PPC Big endian

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with binutils, and it was really painful, it's not really supported anymore

</I>&gt;<i> Currently the PE format would be generated by the assembler/linker.
</I>&gt;<i> You'd need to write some code to be able to generate directly the PE
</I>&gt;<i> binary file.
</I>
Yep, anyway I think code is more or less done, it would just require some time
to reactivate it. ReactOS project could be of some help here as they did the
same thing (they had a binutils patch for ppc-pe).
