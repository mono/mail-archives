You're depending on undefined behavior. The workaround is only
working because the JIT compiler is lazily compiling methods,
and won't compile DoChmod() under Windows.

You should mark DoChmod() with

[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]

Otherwise the issue might come back unexpectedly.

However, if .NET 5.0 would start to eagerly compile assemblies
(for whatever reason), the issue will come back as well.


A sane and easy solution is to deploy Mono.Posing on Windows side-by-
side with you app.

Even when running on Mono, Mono.Posix should be picked up
from the GAC. Your copy won't be loaded anyway.

The super-sane solution is to abstract these calls away using a
factory and 2 assemblies, one for Windows and one for Mono
which has Mono.Posix as a reference.
