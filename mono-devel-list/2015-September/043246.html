<PRE>Sorry it double posted as it was queued and didn't send and I sent it
again. Later my iPad apparently got wifi :) That's fair that you are
trying to avoid it but there are circumstances where it can be a good
idea. As an example if I wanted to start looking at your dependencies
with an analysis tool such as ndepend the dependency on mono.posix
might be an issue.

</I>&gt;<i> Unless I've somehow missed your point? You said that twice, so I want to make sure we're on the same page - You're talking about defining a compiler symbol, and then using [Conditonal] or #if, right? The end result would be different binaries for different platforms. But you can see in my original post, I got my ego bruised and I got taken down a notch by Miguel and others here for doing it - I am *specifically* looking to avoid conditional compilation. That was the point of the original question. The folks who maintain the mono source consider it incorrect enough to reject any pull request that does it, except for compiler code. I'm here to learn a new pattern that is better and more flexible, although not trivial to learn for the first time. That's exactly what I've gotten from Alex and Robert: Use a factory and two assemblies.
