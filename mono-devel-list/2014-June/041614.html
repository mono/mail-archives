Hey Edward,

Thanks for making me smile at the start of the day!

I'm not as naive as you may think.   I know Miguel and Nat personally,
having met them at Xamarin Evolve last year and been in contact
periodically ever since.    I've been asking them about Tizen support for
the last year, but it just isn't a big enough market for them to bother
with YET.    I attended the Tizen Developer Conference last week, and now
have contacts in Samsung and Intel too.     I also have contacts in
Unity3D, having just ended at 15+ year spell at EA.

If you read my TizenExperts posting you will get a better idea of what I'm
looking to build.
<A HREF="http://www.tizenexperts.com/2014/05/introduction-monotizen/">http://www.tizenexperts.com/2014/05/introduction-monotizen/</A>

I'm seeking a contractor PURELY to port the runtime.    It already works on
Linux, and I know that there are already multiple working private ports to
Tizen.  I don't think it's right to keep for Mono Runtime on Tizen to be
commercial.

I'm not trying to build a full Xamarin.Tizen stack, including UI designers,
etc.    That indeed would be a fool's errand.

Phase 1 - Mono Runtime (seeking contractor, or I will do it myself worse
case)

Phase 2 - Bind Tizen C++ APIs using CppSharp (I have a contractor already
lined up)

Phase 3 - Very minimal MonoDevelop plugin (just build, run, debug) based on
existing MeeGo plugin

This humbler project is not an Ark.   It's actually pretty simple, and it
is utterly complementary to Xamarin's business.   I shook Nat's hand last
Tuesday as I gave him on a MonoTizen card in Xamarin's SF offices.    I
spent two hours having lunch with J.Frederick.     I'm not trying to screw
Xamarin or directly compete with them.    Just to starting bringing Mono
(open source) into Tizen world.

Best wishes!

BTW...  The &quot;must not work for Xamarin&quot;  should really have been...  &quot;must
not work for Xamarin,  Microsoft,  Unity,  Samsung or Intel&quot;.
Porting the Mono Runtime to Tizen is a community project.

The benefit of this first phase (with no commercial extras)  is that it
enables any developer in the world to build C# applications on Tizen.   A
huge win for us all.   You'll need to write P/Invoke calls to any native
code and won't have a Tizen-specific support in MonoDevelop,  but it will
kick the answer out of HTML5 development for Tizen,  and will open things
up for the huge number of app developers who will recoil in horror when
they realize the complexity of C++ native development on Tizen.

Cheers,
Bob
