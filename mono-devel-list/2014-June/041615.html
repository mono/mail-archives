<PRE>PS.   If nobody comes forward I WILL just do the work myself.   I've been
doing professional C++ in the games industry for 18 years and am entirely
capable.

I am just very time-limited personally,  and have never built Mono myself,
let alone done a port,  so it's going to be a rather slow process.   I
would rather pay an expert to do it quickly,  so I can get on to the more
interesting phases of the project.

I would have hoped that somebody in this group would have been interested
in porting the Mono Runtime to a true Linux mobile platform, in the open,
and getting paid for their effort into the bargain?

I guess I thought wrong :-(

Cheers,
Bob

</I>&gt;<i> I'm not as naive as you may think.   I know Miguel and Nat personally,
</I>&gt;<i> having met them at Xamarin Evolve last year and been in contact
</I>&gt;<i> periodically ever since.    I've been asking them about Tizen support for
</I>&gt;<i> the last year, but it just isn't a big enough market for them to bother
</I>&gt;<i> with YET.    I attended the Tizen Developer Conference last week, and now
</I>&gt;<i> have contacts in Samsung and Intel too.     I also have contacts in
</I>&gt;<i> Unity3D, having just ended at 15+ year spell at EA.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you read my TizenExperts posting you will get a better idea of what I'm
</I>&gt;<i> looking to build.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm seeking a contractor PURELY to port the runtime.    It already works
</I>&gt;<i> on Linux, and I know that there are already multiple working private ports
</I>&gt;<i> to Tizen.  I don't think it's right to keep for Mono Runtime on Tizen to be
</I>&gt;<i> commercial.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not trying to build a full Xamarin.Tizen stack, including UI
</I>&gt;<i> designers, etc.    That indeed would be a fool's errand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Phase 1 - Mono Runtime (seeking contractor, or I will do it myself worse
</I>&gt;<i> case)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Phase 2 - Bind Tizen C++ APIs using CppSharp (I have a contractor already
</I>&gt;<i> lined up)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Phase 3 - Very minimal MonoDevelop plugin (just build, run, debug) based
</I>&gt;<i> on existing MeeGo plugin
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This humbler project is not an Ark.   It's actually pretty simple, and it
</I>&gt;<i> is utterly complementary to Xamarin's business.   I shook Nat's hand last
</I>&gt;<i> Tuesday as I gave him on a MonoTizen card in Xamarin's SF offices.    I
</I>&gt;<i> spent two hours having lunch with J.Frederick.     I'm not trying to screw
</I>&gt;<i> Xamarin or directly compete with them.    Just to starting bringing Mono
</I>&gt;<i> (open source) into Tizen world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best wishes!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW...  The &quot;must not work for Xamarin&quot;  should really have been...  &quot;must
</I>&gt;<i> not work for Xamarin,  Microsoft,  Unity,  Samsung or Intel&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Porting the Mono Runtime to Tizen is a community project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The benefit of this first phase (with no commercial extras)  is that it
</I>&gt;<i> enables any developer in the world to build C# applications on Tizen.   A
</I>&gt;<i> huge win for us all.   You'll need to write P/Invoke calls to any native
</I>&gt;<i> code and won't have a Tizen-specific support in MonoDevelop,  but it will
</I>&gt;<i> kick the answer out of HTML5 development for Tizen,  and will open things
</I>&gt;<i> up for the huge number of app developers who will recoil in horror when
</I>&gt;<i> they realize the complexity of C++ native development on Tizen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;     .    Must not be employed by Xamarin.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Good luck.  You might as well be asking a single human to build an ark,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or the Titanic.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Xamarin is a whole *company* full of people to make mono run on iOS and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Android primarily (and Mac too, as a 2nd class citizen.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The fact that tizen is linux-based is irrelevant.  So is Android.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Personally I think the best bet is to come up with an attractive business
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> model and form a business relationship to expand Xamarin's product offering
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to include Xamarin.Tizen.  Come up with some investment capital, identify a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> business plan that leverages existing resources where possible and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> increases where necessary...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As I said...  Good luck...
