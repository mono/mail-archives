I have been testing it as well and so far it has all worked great for me on
Ubuntu and CentOS 6.4.

My guess is that Microsoft will product a Mono specific K Runtime (that is
what they are doing now). I believe their goal will be to (wherever
possible) ensure that the packages they build on top work equally well on
both the Windows and Mono versions of the runtime. Currently, the version of
K Runtime has Mono in the name while the packages display generic build
numbers that look the same as what was seen in the Tech Ed demos on Windows.

What I would expect is that Microsoft submit patches back to Mono trunk
required to make one set of packages possible.

Time will tell though. The current work is not identical on the two
platforms. For example, the UseWelcomePage call shown in some of the early
tutorials does not exist on Mono.
