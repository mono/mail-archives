<PRE>This sounds like a great idea!

However, it would be great too if the code could be used in .NET as well
as in the Mono.  Hopefully this class or classes would be in some sort
of easy to reuse module/assembly outside of the core Mono framework
assemblies, making it easier to move over and use in either the .NET
platform or the Mono platform.

Of course, anyone who really wanted to use it in the .NET world could
just extract the source from CVS and compile it separately.  It would be
nice, however, if Mono applications could be &quot;xcopy and run&quot; on the .Net
platform similar to how .Net applications work on Mono (for the most
part).

Hi,

&gt;<i>     Just like the WebRequest class, it could be possible to fetch
</I>files
&gt;<i> using BitTorrent, it could be convenient to transfer files across
</I>&gt;<i> machines on networks, so a user could do:

As long as it doesn't break .NET, I'm for it.

TTFN
