Unfortunately, there is no ideal solution.  Installing GTK is a bit of a
burden for the user, and takes up a bit of space, but now that there's a
nice installer for GTK (google for dropline) and a fairly standard place
for installing it, you can share the library amongst several gtk apps. 
All in all the GTK sharp dependencies aren't terribly large and programs
like Gaim (C++) seem to be quite successful on windows despite having to
distribute the runtime with their exe for those that don't have it.

With the scrapping of the wine-based SWF and the attempt to write
something in pure managed code, perhaps we will get a good
implementation some time.
