<PRE>Hi all,

I'm in the process of developing some purely graphical components for 
.NET in Windows using the MS .NET framework. The core of the code is 
strictly using System.Drawing, and not anything in System.Windows.Forms 
(aside from some lightweight Controls to place on forms, albeit in a 
separate assembly). There is no reference to anything except System and 
System.Drawing in my core assembly. I don't want to rely on Wine, either.

I'm trying to develop them a view to porting them to mono as soon as the 
core Win32 implementation is complete. Bearing this in mind, I have been 
developing my code in a way to abstract everything from the particular 
UI used to display it - if it supports System.Drawing, I'm fine. I will 
certianly create components to render onto and so on in the particular 
UI kits (as I have done with System.Windows.Forms), but for the code 
engine, strictly System.Drawing stuff.

Basically, I'm wondering if anyone has any experience to share with 
doing this. I already have a large body of code complete, but I keep 
coming across little problems that would easily be solved by having a 
reference to the Windows specific stuff - things like detecting which 
keys are held down, passing mouse event information through, and so on. 
Are there any nice patterns to follow? Any tips that would help me? I'm 
aware this is vague questioning, but any tips would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Andy
