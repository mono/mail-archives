<PRE>I don't see it - the files need to be
1. static enough for them to propagate to a large number of peers
before expiring.
2. large enough to warrant the overhead of the initial torrent file
and the P2P discovery.

With these in mind, it seems the admininistrator still needs to
determine which files are and are not torrented.

What could be interesting is if the browser advertised bittorrent
files as a supported mime type; then a supporting server could
redirect via 307 to a torrent file rather than give them the requested
file directly.
