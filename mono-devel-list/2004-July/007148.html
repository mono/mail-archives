I think that motivations like yours are good for mono and .net, because
it helps the growth of this technology.

i think that humans compares everything and there is some king of
comparison of java and .net (mono too).
java have a huge framework with a lot of libraries that helps to develop
every kind of application.
every java developer in the world helps in the development of new
libraries or rewrite older.
sun others entities (jcp for instance) like this kind of initiative and
motivation, so they insert this libraries into the java's framework.

here, i think that me and others like me can help to build a framework
large as java's framework and that help us to solve our problems using
mono.
if i have to build my own library, that ok to me. but i know that this
library could help somebody that have a problem like mine.
i have some java developers friends that ask me why do you use something
that have poor library ??? if i have to develop everything then i will
use something that i know (perl, java, delphi, c/c++, vb) instead of
learning a new technology(c#).
i think that a technology like .net and a language like c# must have a
huge set of functions - because this help the adoption of technology and
language.

i can be wrong but i think this my vision of future.
