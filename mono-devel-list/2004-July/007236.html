<PRE>Sure.  Images over a certain size for starters, and the size could drop as
the server was getting hit more and more.  I wouldn't server any html files
like this, they usually aren't that big.  But a small web-server could then
potentially server a lot of stuff transparently.  And the point would be
that getting the information out slowly is better than not at all.  The
overhead of p2p is on the client side, and thus I don't think it is super
important (because its either tolerate the overhead, or don't get the
content as the web server would die trying).  The point I like about this is
to have a failover system if the server is getting hammered.

I don't see it - the files need to be
1. static enough for them to propagate to a large number of peers
before expiring.
2. large enough to warrant the overhead of the initial torrent file
and the P2P discovery.

With these in mind, it seems the admininistrator still needs to
determine which files are and are not torrented.

What could be interesting is if the browser advertised bittorrent
files as a supported mime type; then a supporting server could
redirect via 307 to a torrent file rather than give them the requested
file directly.
