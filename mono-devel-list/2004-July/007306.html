<PRE>Hello All,

	I've downloaded and installed Mono 1.0 on Mac OS X and have found that 
it is mostly broken (at least that's my impression so far). When trying 
to execute sqlsharp, I get errors that it cannot find it's providers, 
XSP does not work properly, and I cannot get MonoDevelop to run &quot;out of 
the box&quot;.

	O.K. I know that I'm complaining, and I don't like complainers very 
much, so I would like to offer my services to the mono community first, 
as a tester, and then as a developer. I've looked in Objc# and Cocoa# 
but there doesn't seem to be anything there. Does anyone know the 
status of this project?

	I would like to get MonoDevelop up and running on the Mac. I have 
tried to follow the directions on go-mono but, they do not seem to work 
for me. I think the problem has to do with fink and some of the 
dependencies on gtk+2 etc. If someone were willing to hold my hand 
while I perform the installation and configuration, I'd be more than 
happy to write up a &quot;lessons learned&quot; document to post on the Mono or 
independent site. Any takers??


									Kind Regards,

											-B
