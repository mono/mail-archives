I mean someone running FreeBSD that happens to download the tarball from
the mono web site, and tries to build it themselves.

&gt;<i> These values can always be recovered from /usr/ports/Mk/bsd.port.mk. 
</I>&gt;<i> Note that only the first (-STABLE) and last (-CURRENT) choices are

</I>&gt;<i> been able to get lang/mono to run on the non-KSE -CURRENTs, so it's a
</I>&gt;<i> pretty dead choice.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since there's considerable development energy on threads in -CURRENT,
</I>&gt;<i> expect these flags to change &quot;early and often&quot; on -CURRENT.
</I>
That doesn't sound like we can do this in configure then.  We need to
reach a consensus from the FreeBSD users here:  do we just put the ports
options in configure.in?

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; # patch-ltmain.sh
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ltmain is a generated file (from libtool.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; # patch-mono_Makefile.in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Again, Makefile.in is a generated file, built from Makefile.am.  There
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is no tests directory specified in Makefile.am.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a general rule, we try to avoid using automake.  So, we take the
</I>&gt;<i> configure scripts and *.in files as we find them and patch them to
</I>&gt;<i> work.  There's just too much chaos in the auto[tools] stuff--although
</I>&gt;<i> there is a strong effort to resolve this chaos for FreeBSD, we're not
</I>&gt;<i> there yet.
</I>
I think you're going to have to maintain these particular patches
yourself then.
