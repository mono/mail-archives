Actually, just last week I and a friend began to port the libicq2000 
library with exactly the motivation you tell.

I hope so and I do. But as it is, very many people I discuss things with 
dismiss C# and .NET for the only reason that they know that Microsoft 
has its hands in it. It might be that mono won't become widely accepted 
in the free software world before it doesn't go the MS way and become 
incompatible.
