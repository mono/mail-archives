<PRE>I looked into starting a small SF or Novell Forge project for the
Torrent work, but in the process of looking for a name, I found
several existing ones: Torrent#, BT.NET, etc.; the source for some
reason never seems very accessible, I'm looking into this, no reason
recreating other's work.

I think a larger question, brought up by Marcos, is the purpose of
creating C# clients for protocols.  Any such clients should be built
from 100% C# libraries, enabling Mono and/or MS-.NET use.  But it
would really be a Mono undertaking, as the clients would be most
useful if others saw at the same time the development of GTK# clients
for these network protocol clients.

A large community could easily undertake many ports, but it would take
some motivation.  Some might ask, 'why not port Gaim?'  Having a C# IM
client (and IM libraries for other apps to use) would bolster the GTK#
and Mono platform as a viable solution for anyone, especially if
distros began shipping this &quot;Gaim#&quot;, along with a C# Torrent client,
C# FTP client, etc.  But at the same time, Gaim works fine as it is,
as does btdownloadgui.py.  Why spend effort fixing and implementing
these solutions?

A lot probably depends on the future of the Gnome desktop, and the
SUSE-Ximian-Novell future for Linux.  I've heard ramblings about a
strong embrace for a C# Linux desktop environment; imagine if most of
the applications non-developers saw on a daily basis in Gnome were in
fact GTK#/Mono C# apps.

Perhaps the developer's list is not the place for this conversation,
and I apologize if this is the case [one of the topics for this list
is &quot;discussions about future directions&quot;], but this is probably one
place full of strong opinions on the true goals of Mono beyond just
this amazing .NET implementation.  Do people share a common interest
in using Mono to create the next generation of Linux applications?

Thanks for your time and thoughts - if this is the wrong place, please
let me know where to move the discussion to.
