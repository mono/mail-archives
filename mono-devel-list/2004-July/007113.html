<PRE>Hi Mads,

I had not used 'idle' for the longest time until just recently, and had
forgotten how useful it can be to prototype / test things. this little
shell for c# is definitely a step in making c# just as useful. i have
only played around with it for about 2 minutes and reading the ToDo
stuff, the priorities I would set to make it really useful would be
namespace integration and maybe code completion. After that, probably
workspace save/load/clear (variables) etc.

I would recommend looking at the monodevelop/gtksourceview code for the
code completion stuff and maybe it could just be useful in general for
the UI (I know, no UI critiques... ;-). It might even make sense to
integrate your shell into monodevelop as an addin, but that is a whole
other barrel of worms...

Cool app.

Regards,

--chris

ps: to your c# generics TODO: check out gmcs, the mono c# compiler for
generics from cvs.

</I>&gt;<i> The best way to understand what the program does is to try it. But I
</I>&gt;<i> have also tried to give a short explanation of what you can use it for
</I>&gt;<i> in this section. By interactive C# interpreter I mean an environment
</I>&gt;<i> where you can write small pieces of normal C# code. However with two
</I>&gt;<i> differences. Firstly, you do not write method or class
</I>&gt;<i> headers. Secondly, you can have variables that survive after a piece
</I>&gt;<i> of code has been executed and can be used when executing another piece
</I>&gt;<i> of code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would very much like to receive comments about making such an
</I>&gt;<i> interpreter. I would also like to receive comments about making this
</I>&gt;<i> program better integrate with mcs. But I do _not_ currently want to
</I>&gt;<i> receive comments about details in the user interface. Remember this is
</I>&gt;<i> just a prototype.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Below I will explain why I think such a program is a good idea.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Normally when programming, things go in a cycle. Firstly one needs to
</I>&gt;<i> write the code, then compile the code, then execute the code, then
</I>&gt;<i> discover errors, and then one writes new code, ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a time consuming process and should be optimized. C#Shell can
</I>&gt;<i> help with this optimization in two ways.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) In C#Shell one can write each sentence and see what happens. If
</I>&gt;<i> something do not go as planned, one can quickly locate and correct the
</I>&gt;<i> error. It therefore reduces the time between coding and
</I>&gt;<i> response. Which is not just good when programming, but a general
</I>&gt;<i> design principal when designing user interfaces (it is also called
</I>&gt;<i> responsiveness).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Compiling code is often time consuming, as not only the changed
</I>&gt;<i> code needs to be recompiled but also the code depending on the changed
</I>&gt;<i> code. This can easily lead to a large number of files that needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> recompiled. This is not the case in C#Shell, as only the written
</I>&gt;<i> sentences needs to be compiled (and some method/class header
</I>&gt;<i> information automatically generated by the program). This again leads
</I>&gt;<i> to better responsiveness.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, C#Shell also has limitations. When programs get larger it
</I>&gt;<i> will not be beneficiary to only use C#Shell for development, as large
</I>&gt;<i> programs will get unwieldy in C#Shell. What it is good for is trying
</I>&gt;<i> minor stuff, like the functioning of an API, unfamiliar language
</I>&gt;<i> constructs, or testing a homegrown algorithm.
</I>&gt;<i>
