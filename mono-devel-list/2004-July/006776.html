The problem here was that initially, we were building 2 dlls out of one 
folder with a normal make. To accomplish this, the standard build system 
wasn't sufficient, so we basically took the standard library.make and 
duplicated it to build both dlls in one pass. Because of this, any 
changes to library.make need to be reflected in this modified makefile.

It might make sense at this point to just focus on WSE2, and remove some 
of this stuff, but I leave this up to those who are heading down that path.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Actually, there are a handful of WSE2 unit tests as well.
