</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm unclear about your reference to &quot;FreeBSD builders of the tarball.&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I mean someone running FreeBSD that happens to download the tarball from

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
O.K.  Well, what I recommend is:

1) point potential FreeBSD binary users to use pkg_add lang/mono which
will suck down the pre-built tarball from FreeBSD.org and install it. 
I've worked very hard to make this a no-brainer for such users.

2) point potential FreeBSD source users who don't want to be cutting
edge to /usr/ports/lang/mono on there machines where a &quot;make install&quot;
will fetch, compile, and install mono for them.

3) for the cutting edge user, I'd support overriding
PTHREAD_[CFLAGS|LIBS] in the environment for configure and document in
the help portion of configure just like CFLAGS, et al. are documented
now when one does a &quot;configure --help.&quot;  I'd be happy if you'd also
provide such users with my support e-mail address-- <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">coop9211 at uidaho.edu</A>
--so that I can assist them with the particulars.  Meanwhile, I'd
support the -STABLE (the first set) and -CURRENT (the last set) of
options.  You can distinguish this by the build host using *freebsd4 for
-STABLE and *freebsd5 for -CURRENT.  For completeness, a warning if
PTHREAD_CFLAGS or PTHREAD_LIBS is not defined in the environment can
alert such users that they're about to enter uncharted waters.  :)  This
approach is used on libESMTP which I am also the FreeBSD maintainer for
and it has worked quite well.

&gt;<i> &gt; These values can always be recovered from /usr/ports/Mk/bsd.port.mk. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Note that only the first (-STABLE) and last (-CURRENT) choices are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maintained in for ports (such as lang/mono) in the ports tree, but there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are still plenty of people running older -CURRENTs.  However, nobody has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; been able to get lang/mono to run on the non-KSE -CURRENTs, so it's a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pretty dead choice.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Since there's considerable development energy on threads in -CURRENT,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; expect these flags to change &quot;early and often&quot; on -CURRENT.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That doesn't sound like we can do this in configure then.  We need to
</I>&gt;<i> reach a consensus from the FreeBSD users here:  do we just put the ports
</I>&gt;<i> options in configure.in?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; # patch-ltmain.sh
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; ltmain is a generated file (from libtool.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; # patch-mono_Makefile.in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Again, Makefile.in is a generated file, built from Makefile.am.  There
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; is no tests directory specified in Makefile.am.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As a general rule, we try to avoid using automake.  So, we take the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; configure scripts and *.in files as we find them and patch them to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work.  There's just too much chaos in the auto[tools] stuff--although
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there is a strong effort to resolve this chaos for FreeBSD, we're not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think you're going to have to maintain these particular patches
</I>&gt;<i> yourself then.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
That's what I expected, so no problem.
