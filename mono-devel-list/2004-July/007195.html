&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;How interesting a BitTorrent client may seem. It doesn't belong in the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;These days I see more and more additions which build upon Mono. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;I think it would be wise to create a PEAR alike repository where classes

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;become very populaire, maybe than there's an option to distribute the
</I>&gt;<i> class
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;with the main Mono (or MCS) distribution.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Just to clarify things, mbas (the MonoBASIC/VB.NET compiler) does require 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mono.GetOptions, so as the compiler is going into the core (thousands of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ASP.NET developers eager to use mono program in VB.NET exclusively), 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mono.GetOptions will probably go with the core. Besides, many other Mono 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; utilities does use Mono.GetOptions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mono.Posix is required for xsp/mod_mono, so again it's will be a pretty 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; common requirement. Still, last time I saw, such assemblies where being 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; packaged in a separate package, for those that want just a minimal C#-only
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; development environment.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, currently I see Mono growing really fast. But Before you know it, it a
</I>&gt;<i> complete OS..
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First, there's mono. Mono is the runtime to run CLR-code. In my opinion this
</I>&gt;<i> package should be as limited as possible (meaning no compilers!). We have a
</I>&gt;<i> few mono projects in the pipeline, but compilers (for whatever language) for
</I>&gt;<i> forbidden on production servers for obvisous security reasons. The MS
</I>&gt;<i> runtime doesn't provide compilers (the SDK does)..
</I>&gt;<i> I see MCS as the SDK. So MCS should provide the mcs and vbas compilers and
</I>&gt;<i> some optional namespaces)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> MCS is the SDK package for Mono. But MCS gets heavier with every release.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm a development manager and also responsible for deployment of my
</I>&gt;<i> projects. Security is these days a very hot issue. Everything that is not
</I>&gt;<i> needed but is installed is a potentional security risk. 
</I>&gt;<i> Currently mono doesn't come with the posibilty of disable certain
</I>&gt;<i> namespaces. I don't need Mono.Data.MySQL or Mono.Npgsql if I'm using SQL
</I>&gt;<i> Server or oracle. The split up of Mono and MCS it a very good thing. Having
</I>&gt;<i> tools such as mcs, mbas, nant, nunit on production servers are a hackers
</I>&gt;<i> paradise.. ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not saying that I'm almighty or it has to be my way, but I think I would
</I>&gt;<i> be wise not to make each namespace part of the main distribution because a
</I>&gt;<i> program *might* use it. As nant comes with mcs a solution could be:
</I>&gt;<i> - Make a nant task 'dependency' with an download url (maybe from the
</I>&gt;<i> mono-project website). If the dependency is not available on the (current)
</I>&gt;<i> system, nant could download the package, build it (using a build script for
</I>&gt;<i> that package, which could have dependencies on his own)) and installs it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A tool for managing the packages would also be handy. A side from that a
</I>&gt;<i> also mentioned that common used namespaces could be inside the main
</I>&gt;<i> distributions.. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Isn't this the purpose of the GAC?  One (*amazing*) advantage of .NET is
how they manage assembly dependencies, versions, and security.  If you
are an administrator of a system that is using .NET you have fine
grained control over what is available and/or accessible.
