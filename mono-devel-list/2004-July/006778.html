you'll have better results if you try installing them all at the same
time, and let rpm worry about the order in which everything needs to
be installed.

unzip the mono-all.zip file, put all the rpms in one directory and then try:
rpm -Uhv *.rpm

you'll probably get a lot less dependency issues this way... and
hopefully none.  If you still get dependency problems, they will at
least be easier to solve.


&gt;<i>I've tried by installing from source code, but also failed. 
</I>
just so you know, it's better to either install everything from
source, or everything from the rpms... but mixing rpms and installing
from source is bound to cause problems sooner or later.
