<PRE>I originally posted this to mono-list, apologies if you've received it 
twice.

Hi all,

I'm interesting in contributing to Mono, and having checked the website 
for which classes require work, I've decided I would like to help on the 
System.Drawing namespace, as it's an area I'm interested in, and also as 
I have written quite a bit of code against the Microsoft implementation.

So, having checked out what classes/methods are needing work, I'd like 
to also ask the list if anyone else is working on it, or which sections 
are more urgently requiring attention, so I don't tread on anyone's toes 
and can be as useful as possible. Does anyone have any suggestions as 
for what to tackle first, or any areas which are best avoided?

Many thanks,

Andy
