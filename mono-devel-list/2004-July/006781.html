If you study the error carefully, you'll see:

a) You need to install the gtk-sharp package, that will provide you with
mono(foo-sharp).

b) You are missing a dependency of gtk-sharp, that's why it's not being
installed.

&gt;<i> error: Failed dependencies:
</I>&gt;<i>         libgtkhtml3.0_4 is needed by gtk-sharp-1.0-1.ximian.6.0
</I>
And the reason for not being able to install gtk-sharp is the dependency
for &quot;libgtkhtml3.0_4&quot;. I didn't include it in the mono-all.zip package,
as it typically installed from the distribution.

You can fix this by first installing libgtkhtml3.04, and then all should
work out of the box.

Duncan.
