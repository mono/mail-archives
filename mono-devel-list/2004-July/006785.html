<PRE>I am sure everyone knew this already, but I thought this was sort of
enlightening... This is an exchange on the F# group. So it appears that
Mono 1.0 is being used at least to verify compatibility.

======================
Hi Dominic,
 
You should not need to recompile programs when moving to new versions
of
the .NET Framework.  However as you know F# has its own binary writer,
and it is possible that the binaries being written are not correct in
some minor detail that means they are not operating correctly on later
versions.  I'll try a few examples myself, but please feel free to
send
any binaries that are no longer functioning correctly.
 
I regularly recompile code with F# on v2.0 runtimes and haven't seen
any
problems.  Were the binaries compiled with any exotic switches like
--unverifiable?
 
BTW recently I've been setting up a testing framework to make sure
that
F# and Abstract IL compile and work correctly on v1.0, v1.1, v2.0 and
Rotor v1.0, and hopefully Mono 1.0 as well.  
 
Thanks,
Don

&gt;<i> I installed the latest public Framework SDK and redistributable
</I>&gt;<i> (v2.0.40607, available with these 'Express' products [1]) and F#
</I>&gt;<i> programs seem broken... They crash with a unhandled (native)
</I>&gt;<i> exception. The same programs run fine on 1.1 (and did run fine on
</I>&gt;<i> previous 2.0s.) Does anyone have any insight?

May be you have to compile your programs again. I had the same problem
going
from 1.0 to 1.1 version of the framework. Try and let us know.
 
Best regards
