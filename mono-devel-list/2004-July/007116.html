<PRE>Hi Chris

Thanx for trying my program. And thanx for valuable comments.

non-serializable variables. Clear functionality should be easy to add.
Will properly do it soon.

people to just complain about obvious shortcomings. I know they are
there. As I wrote, it is a prototype. The interface is not well thought
out yet. But if anybody writes about a (obivous) shortcoming and helps
in &quot;correcting&quot; it, it is just fine. Just like you helped by providing
good pointers (gtksourceview stuff).

&gt;<i> ps: to your c# generics TODO: check out gmcs, the mono c# compiler for

</I>Thanx for pointer.

Greetings,

Mads
