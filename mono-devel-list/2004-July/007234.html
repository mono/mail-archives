That seems like a damn good idea to me.  It would require quite a bit of
pieces to work together.  If there was a full-featured mono browser (not
that I am suggesting making one) then you would be one step closer to some
of that.  Have you run this by the Firefox team?  The browser integration is
probably the toughest part, as a simple browser plugin won't do.  This is
probably getting off the topic of the list, but man, it makes a LOT of
sense.
