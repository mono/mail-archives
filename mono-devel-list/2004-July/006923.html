<PRE>Hi there.

I would like to run mono on a embedded power pc. The documentation on the 
go-mono website is skimpy and I can't figure out what I need to do as 
opposed to what has already been done. I'm developing on windows due to 
corporate restrictions. I was hoping that the windows installer would 
install everything I need to be able to get a mono runtime targeted at the 
power pc. Is that the case? Or do I have to download a whole bunch of source 
code, all the dependancies for mono as source code plus mono, build it all 
then cross compile for the power pc.

My devlopment team were really hoping that someone else had worked all this 
out and written it all down. We are planning on writing our next project in 
C#. I've all ready tried building mono a few times for windows and 
encountered a lot of problems.

regards
OF40.
