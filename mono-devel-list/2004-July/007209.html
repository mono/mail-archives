<PRE>Hello!

My experience with Mono is very short, just few months, and very positive. 

However, one of the most important features of cross platform OSS is missing
in my opinion and this is the ability to build the distrubution from source
code out of the box on every platform it is designed to support. Currently
used tools which are -nix specific prevent this and obviously one can try to
create his own build environments but I do not think it should be done on
case by case basis by final users - developers using Mono. I would suggest
to do it within Mono project with build environment supporting multiple
platforms i.e. NAnt.

Jacek

PS It i difficult to say that building Mono with cygwin is equivalent to
building Mono on Windows.
