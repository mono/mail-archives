Portable.NET uses Bittorrent to distrbute thier code.

You might get useful info or help by posting there as well.

I'm a relatively new subscriber to many of the Mono mailing lists, and
this is one of the first suggestions that I have become quite
interested in. There have been a few successful attempts at BT C#
ports, such as BT.Net, but the source is not widely available.

I agree that there is amazing potential for this. After reading
Miguel's posting a few days ago, I spent some time analyzing the
Python source and began a small BitTorrent &quot;proof of concept&quot; project.
At this time it's mostly the utilitarian functionality, and I'm not
sure how far I will be able to take this before school starts up
again.

* Is anyone else actively developing, or interested in developing this
functionality?

* How would development of something like this take place - does
Novell have some kind of a SourceForge-like area for Mono-type
projects or extension projects, or would this take place elsewhere for
possible future inclusion in Mono, or would this eventually just move
into the Mono CVS?

Thanks for your time, great idea... A C# client could really move BT
into some new realms.
