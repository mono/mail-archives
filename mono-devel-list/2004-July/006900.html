<PRE>Scratch the surface and I agree with you - XAML and (say) XUL
are very different. XAML is more properly an attempt at model-driven
program specification, rather than a document description language.
The compilation of XAML specs into classes is very different
to the dynamic model-and-view approach of browsers. No one
should confuse the two.

However, at the surface level (some argue that most of the
world is surface), both XAML and competitors provide grammar
alternatives for expressing GUIs. At that grammar level, and
with some inclusions to styling, I think the comparisons are fair.
After all, software development is about expressing technology,
and a great deal of debate gose into how that expression should
be framed.

Of course, if you happen to be a standards maven, then comparisons
are not only fair but also mandatory.

To say that comparisons shouldn't be made at all is to argue that
Mac, PC and X desktops shouldn't be compared for useability
either. Aren't they each based on different technologies?
Clearly there's a flaw in that argument - apples can be compared
with pears when the fundamental capability delivered is roughly
the same in each case.
