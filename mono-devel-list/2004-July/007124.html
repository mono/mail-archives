Good to know that you have been experimenting with MSVB namespace.

&gt;<i> The Microsoft.VisualBasic namespace has some errors with the newline 
</I>&gt;<i> constants that have been there for quite some time. 
</I>
I have fixed the definitions. You should be able to pull the changes from cvs
right now.

Btw, a good catch ...

&gt;<i> Furthermore, it seems like there are bugs in the InputVBFile and 
</I>&gt;<i> BinaryVBFile because they check for only carriage returns to find the end of 
</I>&gt;<i> the line. This approach will not work in Unix, and is only partly correct in 
</I>&gt;<i> Windows. 
</I>
The MSVBFilesystem was squeezed in at the literally the last minute before the tree
was frozen for 1.0 release. So expect to see issues with current builds, but all 
this will be addressed with the 1.2 release. mbas and MSVB namespace will have 
mainstream ready by then.

If you encounter any nagging issues please raise them in the forum and rest assured
that it will be addressed at the earliest. Better still open bugs in Bugzilla and
it will never get lost in the noise in the discussion lists. Make sure that you
add a test case to reproduce the bug you are seeing.

</I>(I previously sent a similar message, but I wasn't subscribed from this 
account, and the administrator hasn't yet approved it)

The Microsoft.VisualBasic namespace has some errors with the newline 
constants that have been there for quite some time. I have finally grown 
tired of seeing them and have written a small patch to fix them.

Furthermore, it seems like there are bugs in the InputVBFile and 
BinaryVBFile because they check for only carriage returns to find the end of 
the line. This approach will not work in Unix, and is only partly correct in 
Windows. It also seems to me that the choice of vbCrLf to mean &quot;\r\n&quot; is 
unwise on most platforms.

I'd like any comments on how this should be handled, and I'd be happy to 
write any patches to fix it.

Jason
