<PRE>&gt;<i>  I'm a relatively new subscriber to many of the Mono mailing 
</I>&gt;<i>  lists, and this is one of the first suggestions that I have 
</I>&gt;<i>  become quite interested in.  There have been a few 
</I>&gt;<i>  successful attempts at BT C# ports, such as BT.Net, but the 
</I>&gt;<i>  source is not widely available.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>  I agree that there is amazing potential for this.  After 
</I>&gt;<i>  reading Miguel's posting a few days ago, I spent some time 
</I>&gt;<i>  analyzing the Python source and began a small BitTorrent 
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;proof of concept&quot; project.
</I>&gt;<i>   At this time it's mostly the utilitarian functionality, and 
</I>&gt;<i>  I'm not sure how far I will be able to take this before 
</I>&gt;<i>  school starts up again.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>  * Is anyone else actively developing, or interested in 
</I>&gt;<i>  developing this functionality?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>  * How would development of something like this take place - 
</I>&gt;<i>  does Novell have some kind of a SourceForge-like area for 
</I>&gt;<i>  Mono-type projects or extension projects, or would this take 
</I>&gt;<i>  place elsewhere for possible future inclusion in Mono, or 
</I>&gt;<i>  would this eventually just move into the Mono CVS?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>  Thanks for your time, great idea... A C# client could really 
</I>&gt;<i>  move BT into some new realms.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>
How interesting a BitTorrent client may seem. It doesn't belong in the main
mono branch (Same with Mono.Posix en Mono.GetOptions).
These days I see more and more additions which build upon Mono. I've been
programming along time in PHP and there's a extention repository called PEAR
(<A HREF="http://pear.php.net">http://pear.php.net</A>). Extentions in PEAR have the same quality as the
extentions supplied with the main php distributions, except that their nor
required by the runtime.

I think it would be wise to create a PEAR alike repository where classes can
be developed which are not directly needed by the runtime. When a class
become very populaire, maybe than there's an option to distribute the class
with the main Mono (or MCS) distribution.


Just my 2 cents,
Dave Mertens
