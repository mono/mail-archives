<PRE>Hi,

Im a little disapointed by your anwer!

I thought that the main interest of the CLI is the inter-platform compatibility.
Then in the theory if you have an'ECMA-compatible runtime engine (and the MCS base calsses) you should run the same &quot;binary&quot; on all platform.

If you must write a version by OS and compile one CLI for each one, why don't use C++ language and GCC?


I've made some tests with simples GUI programs running pretty well with mono. And i hope the future will allow us to maintain only one source code and one CLI for all platform.

Ha ha! Interesting way to go about it, I guess. :)

You might want to have a look at mono's System.Windows.Forms (SWF) implementation before you try to make this journey. It's actually broken at the moment, and the process of re-writing it has just recently begun.

The other thing you may want to look at is GTK#. It would probably require less effort to port any SWF app to GTK# (as the MonoDevelop team has done with SharpDevelop) than trying to piece together broken pieces of SWF. I would recommend finding a much smaller SWF app, and porting that to GTK# to familiarize yourself with the API. Then, if you're looking for features in MonoDevelop which haven't been added yet, perhaps you could give the team a hand? :) The amount they've accomplished in MonoDevelop's short lifespan is almost unfathomable:
teams at various companies are already using MonoDevelop for enterprise application development, which speaks volumes about the work done so far. I think it's a project worth contributing to.
