Good to know that you are interested in working on System.Drawing. There
are couple of things missing in there. You can look for &quot;MonoTODO&quot;
and/or &quot;NotImplemented&quot; tags in System.Drawing and libgdiplus code and
help us finishing the missing things.
As major things are already done, our concentration right now is to make
the graphics and image classes as complete as possible. We have many
small functions missing in graphics, graphicspath and image. You can
take up some missing, notimplemented functions.

If you are looking for a major feature to contribute, it would be
helpful if you can work on printing support. It goes under
System.Drawing.Printing namespace.

Hope, you got some direction to go in. Please let me know if you want to
know anything else.

Thanks,
Ravindra
