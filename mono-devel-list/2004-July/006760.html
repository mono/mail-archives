<PRE>The following is the list of classes in mcs/class/ that are not
included
in the daily tests but have tests. Can it be fixed so that it can be
integrated in daily tests. Let us also add tests for components which do
not have any.

1. Microsoft.Web.Services - has NUnit tests and standalone tests; 'make
run-test' throws the following error
                                                                       
                                                     
        Makefile:165: ../../build/config.make: No such file or
directory
        make: Failed to remake makefile `../../build/config.make'.
                                                                       
                                                     
2. Mono.Cairo - Has no tests, only samples
                                                                       
                                                     
3. Mono.Data - has standalone tests. Compilation succeeds 
   (mcs -r:System.Data -r:Mono.Data test.cs).Throws a
System.Net.Sockets.SocketException during execution
                                                                       
                                                     
4. Mono.Data.DB2Client - has standalone tests. Compilation using mcs
fails

5. Mono.Data.MySql - has standalone tests. Compilation using mcs fails

6. Mono.Data.SqliteClient - has standalone tests. Compilation using mcs
fails

7. Mono.GetOptions - has one standalone test, compilation succeeded; 
   throws an exception during execution

8. Mono.Http - has no tests, only samples

9. Mono.Security.Win32 - 'make run-test' executes and generates
TestResult.xml 
   (but none of the tests pass, since these tests needs to be run on
windows.)

10. System.Data.ObjectSpaces - has NUnit tests. 'make run-test' throws
a compilation error

11. System.Data.OracleClient - has standalone tests. Compilation using
mcs fails

12. System.Web - has standalone tests. Compilation using mcs fails
