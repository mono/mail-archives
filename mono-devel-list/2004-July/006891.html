Thank you for telling me... I'm glad I didn't get any further.. What's
the component?

Sadly, I was hoping that I could write a C# app under linux and then run
it on Windows with little effort (i.e. pre-installed gtk#).. but come to
think of it, the .NET runtime doesn't come pre-installed on Windows 2000
anyway, so I suppose installing gtk# would just be a prerequisite for
running the app that I intend to write.

Thank you all for your comments :)
