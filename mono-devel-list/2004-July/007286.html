<PRE>I have discovered that you can't run a 32 bit mono and 64 bit mono at the
same
time on the same machine (Solaris in my case). I suspect there is something
in the shared .wapi files that isn't fixed in size properly.

I am just wondering how people think this should be addressed. The two
approaches I can think of off the top of my head are:

- Have different files for 32 bit/64 bit processes (put SIZEOF_VOID_P as
part of the file names)
- Track down the structures that are shared and fix their sizes properly.

The first is obvious considerably easier to implement and does seem to work
for me.
The second would mean the processes might cooperate better.

Anyone have opinions?
