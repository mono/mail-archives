<PRE>The option to somehow merge (or at least synchronize) your MS.NET GAC and
your mono GAC would be nice. There probably is a very good reason not to do
this that I haven't thought of yet though.

Subject: [Mono-dev] What would you like to see in Mono?

Hey,

     What would be the top feature you would like to see in Mono?

     Think of a feature that is not something we are currently working
on (we know about those), for example avoid saying: a class-is-missing
feature or &quot;IDE&quot; or &quot;the debugger&quot;.  We know about those.

Miguel.
