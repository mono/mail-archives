Hi,

- Optimizations for embedded use. Currently the Java for ARM I've been 
using is faster than Mono, especially startup time is very much 
faster with Java.

- Continuations and microthreads. This is actually something that I've 
been hacking together, and I even managed to get something running. 
Continuations with native code and microthreads and scheduler with C#.

- More support for dynamic languages. Perhaps there's an unsafe way (read: 
you have to know what you are doing) to unload types. Or perhaps a 
modified mcs could generate code for dynamic methods. Or something else I 
haven't thought about =).

Of course the latter two mentioned things break CLI-standard compliance...

  Tomi
