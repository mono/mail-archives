<PRE>                                Hi,

 Please-Please file bug reports for the issues that can be considered bugs, like
the &quot;more robust reporting of the stack traces of all threads with SIGQUIT.&quot;
issue, which I never heard about before. I can't promise that we will fix all
of our bugs in a short time, but I can promise that we can't fix bugs which we
don't know anything about :).

                   Zoltan

</I>&gt;<i> Although not really in Mono itself, one thing I would like to see is
</I>&gt;<i> better integration with automake.  The main Beagle Makefile.am is
</I>&gt;<i> currently 1181 lines.  There is definitely room for us to clean this up
</I>&gt;<i> substantially a bit on our own, but I've love to see things like
</I>&gt;<i> compilation handled automatically, installation of .mdb files, maybe
</I>&gt;<i> even automatic gacutil for assemblies, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Beyond that, additional profiling tools would help a lot.  Specifically:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         * A profiler that tracked threads.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         * A profiler that tracked when files were opened and closed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         * A profiler which detected potential deadlocks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd recommend really investigating all the profilers and debugging tools
</I>&gt;<i> available for Java and then work on implementing them in Mono.  As I've
</I>&gt;<i> said to you personally many times before, the biggest difficulty in
</I>&gt;<i> developing applications in Mono at this point is a lack of high-quality
</I>&gt;<i> tools.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In addition, various bug fixes related to profiling: heap-buddy locks up
</I>&gt;<i> instantaneously on SMP machines (not sure if Jon ever filed that or had
</I>&gt;<i> just had discussions about it with Ben and others) and more robust
</I>&gt;<i> reporting of the stack traces of all threads with SIGQUIT.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It might also be helpful if the various profilers could be integrated
</I>&gt;<i> into MonoDevelop or something to give profiling info while the program
</I>&gt;<i> is running.  This data is most useful when it can be visualized.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Coverage tools, both at compile and runtime, integrated into Mono would
</I>&gt;<i> be handy.  I am sure .NET ones exist out there, but they're neither
</I>&gt;<i> immediately obvious nor immediately useful inside a Unix Mono
</I>&gt;<i> development environment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And one thing that has always bugged me: my apps all behave strangely
</I>&gt;<i> and then crash when I recompile underneath a running instance.  That's
</I>&gt;<i> very annoying, and I suspect it's also a problem if you upgrade packages
</I>&gt;<i> and an app is running as well.
