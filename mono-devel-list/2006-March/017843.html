This is because Mono's current GC is the Boehm GC, which is a
conservative collector.

Here, &quot;conservative&quot; means &quot;non-generational&quot; and &quot;non-compacting&quot;; it's
like malloc(3) (pointers are never moved), with all the heap
fragmentation problems that incurs.

Paolo Molaro is working on a replacement GC, as mentioned here:
