<PRE>&gt;<i>     What would be the top feature you would like to see in Mono?
</I>
A cross-platform GUI that doesn't suck visually.  Maybe Windows.Forms will
be OK, but Gtk# sucks on Windows - not your fault I guess.  wxSharp maybe?

And *please* reduce the dependencies.

Any make it build out of the box on a raw install of Visual Studio Express.

And make Sol10+ a primary platform, SPARC and x64.

I know this started from a GNOME on Linux background, but thats still
somewhat a minority platform beyond ISPs and compute grids as far as I can
tell - at least in banks in the City.

I kinow you're working on some of these - but its a matter of focus.

James
