<PRE>This is rather off topic from the original thread &quot;What would you like
to see in Mono&quot;.  Thus, I created a new thread for this discussion while
leaving Joe's original message in this mail.

I have been working on a proposal to extend Oprofile to profile the
&quot;anonymous samples&quot; resulted from jitted code.  I am not familiar enough
with Mono to determine how such profiler will benefit Mono.  I would
like to know if such profiler would benefit Mono, and also how would you
use this profiler if it is available.  

If this profiler can benefit Mono, I would like to write a profile agent
for Mono and make sure that it will work with Mono.  It would also be
great if someone can point me the files that I should check if I ever
need to look at how Mono creates jit code.

</I>&gt;<i> automatic gacutil for assemblies, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Beyond that, additional profiling tools would help a lot.
</I>&gt;<i> Specifically: 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         * A profiler that tracked threads.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         * A profiler that tracked when files were opened and closed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         * A profiler which detected potential deadlocks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd recommend really investigating all the profilers and
</I>&gt;<i> debugging tools available for Java and then work on
</I>&gt;<i> implementing them in Mono.  As I've said to you personally
</I>&gt;<i> many times before, the biggest difficulty in developing
</I>&gt;<i> applications in Mono at this point is a lack of high-quality tools.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In addition, various bug fixes related to profiling:
</I>&gt;<i> heap-buddy locks up instantaneously on SMP machines (not sure
</I>&gt;<i> if Jon ever filed that or had just had discussions about it
</I>&gt;<i> with Ben and others) and more robust reporting of the stack
</I>&gt;<i> traces of all threads with SIGQUIT.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It might also be helpful if the various profilers could be
</I>&gt;<i> integrated into MonoDevelop or something to give profiling
</I>&gt;<i> info while the program is running.  This data is most useful
</I>&gt;<i> when it can be visualized.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Coverage tools, both at compile and runtime, integrated into
</I>&gt;<i> Mono would be handy.  I am sure .NET ones exist out there,
</I>&gt;<i> but they're neither immediately obvious nor immediately
</I>&gt;<i> useful inside a Unix Mono development environment.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And one thing that has always bugged me: my apps all behave
</I>&gt;<i> strangely and then crash when I recompile underneath a
</I>&gt;<i> running instance.  That's very annoying, and I suspect it's
</I>&gt;<i> also a problem if you upgrade packages and an app is running as well.
