<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> &gt; What i'd like to see in mono is the ability to start up an application
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without it needing a .WAPI folder. I understand why mono needs the wapi
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; folder, but i'm sure there are application for which one wouldn't need one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at all.
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah that would really useful.
</I>
For that, try using MONO_DISABLE_SHM=1 on your environment.

Notice that a number of features will not work without Wapi (named
thread synchronization primitives).

Miguel.
