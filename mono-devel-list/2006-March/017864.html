GnomePrint is dead, the Gtk printing api will be cairo based.  The mono
cairo bindings still need some work, and we need to make sure we expose
all the cairo wrapper methods in things like pango.  F-Spot has the
start of a sane binding that I did in my spare time.  I plan to finish
it at some point.  TWAIN is unlikely as it can involve direct win32
calls.

F-Spot needs steroids?
