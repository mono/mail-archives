<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> 5) Managed P2P technology support (not for piracy but for distribution
</I>&gt;<i> of info) - which could easily be based on extended Web Services
</I>&gt;<i> technology.
</I>
Some time ago a few people were looking at implementing a BitTorrent
client.

I believe what happened is that two different groups were working on
this, then they though &quot;Oh, the other group is probably going to
succeed&quot; and both groups abandoned the effort.

A shame.

Miguel.
