We need to implement shadow copying to allow for changes on running
assemblies (but aside from ASP.NET where it is enabled by default,
even on MS' .NET one need to turn it on explicitly for every AppDomain
that needs it).
That turns on-the-fly updates for plugins, and even whole-apps, a real
possibility.

As I'm currently working a lot with Java and even fixing Java VMs
(JamVM/Kaffe) and GNU Classpath code, I think I may partly borrow the
title (Javaman) from my friend Bruno Souza and become the
MonoNJavaMan. Yeah, I may currently be crazier than usual...
