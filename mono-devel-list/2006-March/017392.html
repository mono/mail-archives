I think some guys dream too much performance boost from the
runtime improvements.

Even after having about half of a month for optimizing System.Xml
and 1.5x - 2x performance improvement (it is after several
optimization attempts done before by Ben, myself and others),
I still have/had very few things to blame on the runtime - even
enabling inline / copyprop / consprop / deadce helps only about
10% improvement, and I don't think it could improve performance
much more.

It might be nice if Hubert post actual code that uncovers slowness
that (you claim) caused by the GC, and then everyone would happen
to know which is bad (it's still useful if we could find the
performance problem inside the class libraries).

BTW If there are such people who can improve class library
performance including sys.xml better than now, they are
highly welcomed ;-)
