All of this is very interesting, but do you have a profile run that
shows memcpy() to be in the hot spots?

Having 3 implementations of the same thing is orrible for mainatinance
and code bloat.
As for the cutoff values for managed/unmanaged implementations: they
vary a lot dependning on the architecture and we're not going to insert
lots of arch-specific code in corlib (at least not for small
improvements).
The way to move forward is:
*) write managed versions of the methods, avoinding icalls when possible
*) benchmark and if we are significantly slower than the icall:
  a) optimize the managed code
  b) enhance the jit so it optimizes the code better

Some very specific and common methods may be implemented in hand-coded
assembly in the jit if really needed (read: after some real world code
shows them as hot spots).
