<PRE>Yeah,

I'm documenting compiler design and not end user's experience. (like 
using variations of jay, flex, cup, etc.. and models and terms used in 
generation of CLI assemblies as com paired to generating something like 
javabyte code or traditional apps that do some type of interpreting).

I know that CSC creates a temp directory in where ever %TEMP% is 
pointed to, to create the object files and deletes them when its all 
done building but the compiler inlined in Visual Studio creates a local 
directory to store the object files (the lovely 'obj' dir you find 
lerking around).

IIRC, doing that method allows them to do incremental builds on only 
the parts that change. It seems as if they build each 
object/file/unit/whatever independently, then sort it all out after 
everything is built by linking everything up. I'm just assuming that 
from the filenames it generates and becuase you see some very creative 
error messages in VS that when a build fails that something like this 
might be happing. Like you said, it could be its own mechnisim, that 
allows them to store the generated backends to file for temporary 
storage instead of holding in memory (to gain speed or something for 
their 'enterprise level' versions of their compiler or something, who 
knows?), but its interesting stuff to watch. I really like when putting 
VS in a debugger and walk it through step by step while watching the 
directory for changes during a build to see what it creates and deletes 
really quickly.

This is only just from what I see from dumps, but it always seemed that 
CSC (and VS's embedded version) always seemed to generate output in 
some circumstances that would be really hard to generate strictly from 
reflection.emit if at all possible (but that is just from my experience 
using reflection.emit) although its not nessiary to do it the way its 
done in those differences to get the job done.

Not sure how credible this is but it says on the DotGNU wiki about how 
their compiler works compared to ours: &quot;..CSCC is a 3 step compile, 
assemble and link compiler, while MCS is a direct codegeneration in 
memory with Reflection.Emit.&quot; They might be doing something completely 
different system then anyone else out there (since they also target 
javabyte code) or it might be just a creative spin to the same ideas 
here but some where they mentioned not even having a barely complete 
reflection.emit. It sort of seemed like this was almost like the method 
that VS was using with the whole 'obj' directory thing but maybe not so 
much. What I'm getting at is the reflection.emit model would seem to 
build from the bottom up in a more logical order, instead of building 
laterally (for lack fof a better word). When it comes to the design of 
the compiler, this would make a big difference.
