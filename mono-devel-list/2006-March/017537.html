<PRE>I fixed some bugs in xbuild.

First, there's no reason for BuildItem.GetMetadata to always fail when
the file doesn't exist, msbuild doesn't do that. Stuff that only relies
on the path should work.

I also modified DirectoryScanner a lot. It used to reorder multiple
includes and fail on duplicates. msbuild doesn't do either.

The patch is from a svn diff in the root mcs dir.

Right now xbuild won't work with msbuild projects because of path
separator problems. A patch to make xbuild take both / and \ as path
separators should be easy to write, but it's ugly. On the other hand
current behaviour makes xbuild useless. Will you accept the patch if I
write it?

Also, I noticed that in mono both Path.DirectorySeparatorChar and
Path.AltDirectorySeparatorChar are /, while msdn says on unix they
should be / and \. I know monodoc says they're both /, but why?
