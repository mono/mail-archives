What do you have in mind, exactly?

.NET 2.0 added System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod, largely to target
dynamic languages such as IronPython.  It provides access to an
ILGenerator for a method, and the DynamicMethod + IL + assembly language
is garbage collected in the usual fashion (instead of being tied to an
Assembly, thus necessitating an AppDomain unload to free the memory).

Given IronPython is Microsoft's dynamic-language testbed, and it's
running rather nicely under .NET, I'm not sure how much more needs to be
added to better support dynamic languages...
