</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anyway, wouldn't that lead to the same problem? I mean, some people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could install a diferent version of Gtk# onto they're .NET leading to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the very same issue?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> NO.  As I stated in my original message there are a collection of
</I>&gt;<i> assembly libraries that are &quot;Policy&quot; dlls. ...
</I>
I assumed that
&quot;There should be a set of policy dlls that...&quot;
meant that there aren't but that there should be, instead of &#171;it is suposed to be&#187;.

Anyway, if there are suposed to exist those policy dlls, then a application Gtk#
2.4 made in mono 1.1.13.2 should run on mono 1.1.13.4.
That leaves me clueless as to why it complains of not finding the Gtk# 2.4 in
mono 1.1.13.4.


&gt;<i> You really should have your testers try out the Gtk# Installers for .NET
</I>&gt;<i> that I linked to on my original reply, before giving up on it.
</I>
I am the developer and i shouldn't make my users test that kind of stuff. It is
i who should test it. Only when i can make it work for myself, should i make my
users use such.

Anyway, my first attempt failed miserably, i don't like the idea of my program
beeing dependant on anything of microsoft, i hate the idea of having to tell my
users that downloaded mono to just scrap it and i really hate the idea of having
to tell my users to install yet another thing, .net.
So i don't think i will follow that path until i'm without any possible kind of
hope in other paths.
