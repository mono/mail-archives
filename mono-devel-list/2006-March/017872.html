TWAIN's available on Mac OS X, too. With some abstraction it should be
reasonably possible to support both Win32 and Mac with a common TWAIN binding; I
hacked up Gimp's TWAIN plugin to support the Mac a while back.

Wrapping both SANE and TWAIN would take even more abstraction, but ought to be
possible.
