</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     What would be the top feature you would like to see in Mono?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A cross-platform GUI that doesn't suck visually.  Maybe 
</I>&gt;<i> Windows.Forms will be OK, but Gtk# sucks on Windows - not 
</I>&gt;<i> your fault I guess.  wxSharp maybe?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And *please* reduce the dependencies.

This is definitely a big one.

It's funny, because I avoid re-building my mono installation more than 3
times a year - everytime it's a bit of a stressful event!! :-) We have quite
a few servers relying on it.

Although, James, I've been watching this mono effort for more than two years
now, and it's gone a long way. I remember the days you had to install Wine
to get some sort of UI forms up and running.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any make it build out of the box on a raw install of Visual 
</I>&gt;<i> Studio Express.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And make Sol10+ a primary platform, SPARC and x64.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know this started from a GNOME on Linux background, but 
</I>&gt;<i> thats still somewhat a minority platform beyond ISPs and 
</I>&gt;<i> compute grids as far as I can tell - at least in banks in the City.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I kinow you're working on some of these - but its a matter of focus.
</I>&gt;<i>
