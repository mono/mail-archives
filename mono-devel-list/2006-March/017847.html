Hi,

Yes, DynamicMethod is quite a nice feature, and IronPython is a great 
tool, I've been using them both.

But DynamicMethods have their downside, as they are, in a sense, just 
plain global static functions. You lose the class structure etc.

I imagine that unloading a type is possible, but it's very hard to ensure 
that no one will use that unloaded type. But if I implement a framework 
that handles the type loading and unloading, I could live with the fact 
that if the core framework bugs, the application will crash.

I think the IronPython guys have problems because of DynamicMethods. 
DynamicMethods are very good for helper functions, like complied regexp 
parser, but using them to implement a full object oriented language is not 
that simple. Of course DynamicMethods are much better than what we had in 
.Net 1.1 (ie. nothing =).

Also, I don't like python very much, and I'd like the language to be 
strictly typed. What I would like is a C# with type unloading.
