</I>I am looking forward to see new GC - I wish I had time to put into Mono, 
but sadly at the moment I am totally tied up :(

What's the status on implementation of new GC - the link said it should 
be rolled out in Feb-Mar, which is pretty much now?

The whole issue of memory is not that straightforward as I thought 
initially - particularly when it comes to fragmentation, I am currently 
battling with this issue in my main app in .NET - it takes far more time 
than its supposed to :(
