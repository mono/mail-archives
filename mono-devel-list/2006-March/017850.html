.NET 1.1 *has* type unloading.  It just requires unloading the hosting
AppDomain in order to unload the types. :-)

Given all the interdependencies between JITed code, executing code, and
call stacks, unloading types is a difficult proposition, which is
probably why an AppDomain unload is the only way to do that under .NET.

So what's wrong with AppDomains?  If they're too slow, perhaps we should
improve cross-AppDomain invocation.  If they're buggy, they should be
fixed.
