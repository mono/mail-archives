<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> This summer I will be helping some interns who will be doing a Mono port to
</I>&gt;<i> PASE under i5/OS (the OS for IBM's iSeries).  PASE is essentially AIX as
</I>&gt;<i> far as the code running under it goes and iSeries hardware is Power.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Given that the interns are only going to be here a limited time I am
</I>&gt;<i> wondering what would be the best Mono release for them to work on, at least
</I>&gt;<i> initially.  I'd prefer they have a stable base so they can concentrate on
</I>&gt;<i> getting the port to work but then we'd like them to work on the latest
</I>&gt;<i> stuff too.
</I>
I would use the latest tarball release available at the time of the
port.

The tarball releases are compiled on a number of platforms before they
are released to the public.  This will help if they need to copy and
paste some code from another platform: at least the code will be known
to work on that other system.

Depending on when the students start we might have moved the JIT engine
to the new IR representation.  We will keep you posted.

Miguel.
