In the original report, you said &quot;Its not perfect, but better than
nothing.&quot;

Which implies to me that it is in some way buggy. :)  I thought I
recalled seeing a FIXME in there, but upon further investigation I
didn't see one.  Maybe it's been fixed since then?

Regardless, I've been pretty diligent about filing bugs, and you guys
have been very good about fixing them, which I appreciate.  Sometimes
the bugs are harder to quantify than others.

Thanks,
Joe
