<PRE>There should be a set of policy dlls that are placed in the GAC so that 
even when a distribution of Gtk# may be at 2.8, assemblies that were 
built using 2.4 or 2.6 would work fine in 2.8.

As far as having your application distributed in Windows, you could 
consider having your app run with the .NET Framework Runtime and just 
adding the Gtk# Installer for the .NET Framework Runtime 1.1/2.0 
available here:

I hope this helps.  I am still on the road back to Fort Worth from Utah, 
so I apologize for the latency.
