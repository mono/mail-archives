<PRE>&gt;<i> Hey,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     What would be the top feature you would like to see in Mono?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Think of a feature that is not something we are currently working
</I>&gt;<i> on (we know about those), for example avoid saying: a class-is-missing
</I>&gt;<i> feature or &quot;IDE&quot; or &quot;the debugger&quot;.  We know about those.
</I>&gt;<i>

Something similar to WinFS will be really great for Linux : A unique 
database shared by all application for access data, for example :
- music player/organizer like Muine and Banshee will access same music 
database (same concept for other media like photo with f-spot)
- unique adress book and mail repository
There's a lot of possibilities : beagle enhancement, easy sharing of 
data across databases (across computer, across universe)
Isn't it exciting ? :)
