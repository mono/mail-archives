<PRE>
I'd like to see better memory management for long running applications - 
particularly in memory fragmentation area that seems to be rather weak 
in .NET (and any other GC based language?)

Don't want to throw stones as its amazing what was achieved in Mono, but 
IMO, Microsoft's implementation of Garbage Collection is considerably 
better - not speed wise, but reclaiming memory that is no longer in use.

regards,

Alex
