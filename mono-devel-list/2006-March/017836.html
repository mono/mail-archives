a mono plugin to firefox, and IE, etc, allow you to run your app. in these browsers,
in addition to having signed protection.
With sandbox type security as a later improvement.
I want to be able to program something in mono, and have it run everywhere and use it for 
most every task ... i.e.
1) scripting in linux/unix
2) server apps
3) gui app.
4) browser plugin
we have 1-3, lets get 4!

I mean, why do i want to work with Java, or Flash or activeX plugin as my only choice now ?
Its logical to assume I should be able to get my mono c# stuff running in a browser.
I think this was brought up before, and someone mentioned it would be almost impossible
to do the sand box .. well ok , screw the sandbox, the activeX plugin doesn't have that either,
just means most public app would need to be signed, for at least some integrity process.
