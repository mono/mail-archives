<PRE>Hello,
&gt;&gt;<i> My concern was not about speed, but about reliability. I just don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> believe it is worthwhile
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to utilize file system when it can be done in memory.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Are you sure that the filename will be unique even when you run several
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instances of mcs simultaneously ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now I understand that we did not understand each other previously 
</I>&gt;<i> regarding
</I>&gt;<i> this question.:) I was speaking about .res to resource table conversion
</I>&gt;<i> while you were speaking about the resource file generated by mcs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Several moths ago I wanted to modify GetTempFileName to use a 16-bit 
</I>&gt;<i> suffix
</I>&gt;<i> to be fully MS.NET compatible but the result of the debate was to keep 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> 32-bit one as Linux has a single temp directory while Windows has 
</I>&gt;<i> per-user
</I>&gt;<i> temp directories so a 16-bit suffix were possiblie insufficient while a
</I>&gt;<i> 32-bit is likely to be enough. So I belive that mcs can obtain a 
</I>&gt;<i> unique file
</I>&gt;<i> name. If not I think it is GetTempFileName that should be modified.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I prefer using temporary resource files because this way we don't need
</I>&gt;<i> non-public Mono-only functionality in SRE as we can use the public
</I>&gt;<i> DefineUnmanagedResource method. I think that it's reliable.
</I>Fair enough.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, you can place there any files which you require for your test case.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's good practice to use same file name as is name of test file, just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> add some prefix.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK. Is it OK if I upload some tests for these expected error codes to SVN
</I>&gt;<i> before they are available in mcs?
</I>It is not common practice but you can. However, don't forget to update 
know-issues- files.

&gt;&gt;<i> You are saying that all these files are not used by corlib ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ... (file names)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please have a look at the modified corlib.dll.sources, 
</I>&gt;<i> PEAPI.dll.sources and
</I>&gt;<i> mcs.exe.sources and you will see what files are needed by these 
</I>&gt;<i> assemblies.
</I>&gt;<i> There are no unnecessary classes included in any of these lists so you 
</I>&gt;<i> can
</I>&gt;<i> compare them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are some basic, infrastructural classes like ResourceNode and
</I>&gt;<i> ResourceStream that are common. PEAPI only uses .res to resource table
</I>&gt;<i> conversion classes. mcs only uses .res generation classes with version 
</I>&gt;<i> info
</I>&gt;<i> and icon support. SRE is the most compilcated it can convert .res to
</I>&gt;<i> resource table and generate version info resource but that version info
</I>&gt;<i> resource is a bit different than the one that is generated by mcs. So SRE
</I>&gt;<i> has no icon support that means that mcs uses about 7 files that are 
</I>&gt;<i> not used
</I>&gt;<i> by SRE. And of course a lot of files used by SRE are not required by mcs
</I>&gt;<i> that are about 14 files.
</I>I found that only 'DefaultResource' is used in mcs and all used 
properties are of simple types.
I know there are internal dependencies but I still think that the list 
can be reduced.

Marek
