<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> I am looking forward to see new GC - I wish I had time to put into Mono, 
</I>&gt;<i> but sadly at the moment I am totally tied up :(
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What's the status on implementation of new GC - the link said it should 
</I>&gt;<i> be rolled out in Feb-Mar, which is pretty much now?
</I>
It has been rolling into SVN for the past few weeks, the details are
scattered across many different commits and many different areas.

But if you are curious, you can read the archives and search for commits
from Paolo Molaro.

Miguel.

</PRE>
