<PRE>Hi all. I have some questions.
   
  1. I tried to build and execute the examples in the embed folder. The instruction in file test.c is as follows:
   
  /*
 * Very simple mono embedding example.
 * Compile with:
 *      gcc -o teste teste.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs mono` -lm
 *      mcs test.cs
 * Run with:
 *      ./teste test.exe
 */

  
I followed the instruction above. But I always get this error:
   
  ./teste: error while loading shared libraries: libmono.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
   
  Then I tried to find libmono.so.0 file. I copied that libmono.so.0 file to the embed folder (folder where teste and test.exe reside).

  But I still got the same error message. Then, I run &quot;teste test.exe&quot; from the original folder where libmono.so.0 resides. It still didn't work.
  Can anyone tell me what's wrong? What should I do to get it works?
   
   
  2. Is there any standard library in mono that is implemented in C and executed via internal calls?  Basically, I want to know real examples (in the real Mono runtime implementation) that are executed in similar way to the examples in the embed folder.
   
  I see a lot of the following code
   
  [MethodImplAttribute (MethodImplOptions.InternalCall)]
   
  inside the mcs sub-folders. So, I presume there must be some functions in the standard library that are implemented in C 
   
  For information, I am running Mono 1.1.13.2 under x86 platform. I know that for some functions (eg. in System.Math) the calls to C code are replaced by direct floating point instructions. I am not interested in this. I want examples in the real Mono runtime that are executed in similar way to the examples in the embed folder.
  Many thanks for your attention.
   
   
  Rusmin
