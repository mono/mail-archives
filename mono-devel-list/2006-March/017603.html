<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Yes, and as you've probably surmised I'm trying to do run your example
</I>&gt;<i> code from <A HREF="http://monkey.workarea.jp/lb/archive/2005/3-12.html">http://monkey.workarea.jp/lb/archive/2005/3-12.html</A> but even
</I>&gt;<i> after getting Commons.Xml.Relaxng into the gac I still get errors
</I>&gt;<i> claiming that Commons namespaces cannot be found when trying to
</I>&gt;<i> compile test.cs (using msc), this also includes the Namespaces under
</I>&gt;<i> Commons of course,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> using Commons.Xml.Relaxng;
</I>&gt;<i> using Commons.Xml.Relaxng.Rnc;
</I>&gt;<i> using Commons.Xml.Nvdl;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> raises six errors.
</I>
Maybe those errors will go away with -r:Commons.Xml.Relaxng.dll
option to the compiler command line. mcs (gmcs), in fact as well
as csc, does not automatically recognize assemblies in the GAC
that are possibly referenced (by nature of assembly qualification).

&gt;<i> Since you're aware of the UBL connection I'll go into a little more context
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I went this route (Mono) because getting the precompiled
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~eb2m-mrt/dsdl/enovdl.exe">http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~eb2m-mrt/dsdl/enovdl.exe</A> to work with XML
</I>&gt;<i> Schema was of course problematic.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the off-chance that you know anything about this application:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  I am running .Net 2.0 but am still getting the 1.* error, was the bug
</I>&gt;<i> not fixed in 2.0 as expected or could it be that the 1.1 that I have
</I>&gt;<i> running side by side with my 2.0 is being used in the application, and
</I>&gt;<i> is there a way to change it?
</I>
If you are going to run your application (well, seems like it
is my code ;-) under MS.NET, then you will have to copy
Commons.Xml.Relaxng.dll *from 2.0 directory* of the monocharge
to the same directory you are running mcs. No GAC installation is
required. (For Mono it is easier to install it to GAC since there
is already Commons.Xml.Relaxng.dll in the mono GAC.)

And then the compiler should be either csc from .NET 2.0 or gmcs,
not mcs (since in lax speaking mcs generates executables that
targets .NET 1.x). As long as you compile it with mcs, the
generated executable targets .NET 1.x, not 2.0.

As noted above, you need -r:Commons.Xml.Relaxng.dll.

&gt;<i> Sorry to be asking so many stupid questions but the .Net stacks are
</I>&gt;<i> not my technology of greatest familiarity so I'm somewhat lost as well
</I>&gt;<i> as in a situation where I'm just interested in getting something up
</I>&gt;<i> and running quickly, so I can move onto the other tests that are
</I>&gt;<i> actually important for the project.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It could be that this should be off the mono-devel list since it's
</I>&gt;<i> pretty specific at this point.
</I>
Well, mono-list is better for mono users like you, but it is
trivial problem. It is of course OK to just send messages to me.

Oh, and I should warn that this NVDL stuff is so unused and it
is likely to happen that you find bugs here and there ;-)

Cheers,
Atsushi Eno
