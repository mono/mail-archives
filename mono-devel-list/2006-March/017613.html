<PRE>Hi,

Originally I didn't plan to create a patch I only made some suggestions. But
then I realized that current the UnicodeEncoding is too inefficient.

So I implemented my idea to UnicodeEncoding.

UnicodeEncodingPerformance.cs is the test I used.

Results:
Before:
1, string to byte[], same: 265
1, char[] to byte[], same: 282
1, byte[] to char[], same: 453
1, string to byte[], diff: 265
1, char[] to byte[], diff: 266
1, byte[] to char[], diff: 453
4, string to byte[], same: 672
4, char[] to byte[], same: 703
4, byte[] to char[], same: 594
4, string to byte[], diff: 656
4, char[] to byte[], diff: 609
4, byte[] to char[], diff: 641
1024, string to byte[], same: 1406
1024, char[] to byte[], same: 1391
1024, byte[] to char[], same: 922
1024, string to byte[], diff: 1297
1024, char[] to byte[], diff: 1281
1024, byte[] to char[], diff: 1250
1048576, string to byte[], same: 3453
1048576, char[] to byte[], same: 2500
1048576, byte[] to char[], same: 1515
1048576, string to byte[], diff: 2734
1048576, char[] to byte[], diff: 1407
1048576, byte[] to char[], diff: 1312


After:
1, string to byte[], same: 578
1, char[] to byte[], same: 563
1, byte[] to char[], same: 844
1, string to byte[], diff: 328
1, char[] to byte[], diff: 359
1, byte[] to char[], diff: 578
4, string to byte[], same: 578
4, char[] to byte[], same: 563
4, byte[] to char[], same: 812
4, string to byte[], diff: 391
4, char[] to byte[], diff: 406
4, byte[] to char[], diff: 594
1024, string to byte[], same: 47
1024, char[] to byte[], same: 47
1024, byte[] to char[], same: 62
1024, string to byte[], diff: 203
1024, char[] to byte[], diff: 204
1024, byte[] to char[], diff: 203
1048576, string to byte[], same: 391
1048576, char[] to byte[], same: 375
1048576, byte[] to char[], same: 375
1048576, string to byte[], diff: 984
1048576, char[] to byte[], diff: 391
1048576, byte[] to char[], diff: 375

Note these are the results of two actual executions so they are not fully
representative.

As you can see converting 1 character became slower. But longer strings are
much faster converted (4 bytes for example). Just to show how inefficient
the old code was converting 1024 characters is about 20-30 times faster than
it was before.

I think converting a single character should not be optimized as doing so is
already inefficient. It's much faster to use convert it inline using shift
operators.

Please review and approve the patch.

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's always nice if encoding conversion stuff get faster. Can you
</I>&gt;<i> also provide how it becomes faster when you finish writing the patch?
