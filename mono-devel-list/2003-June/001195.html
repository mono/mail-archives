I would say its possible (instead of easy).

</I>
Well, I agree that we have a phase ordering problem here, but its the
best place i found. 

Please notice that I inserted the cmove optimization after all other ssa
based optimizations, just before instruction selection. So you dont need
to consider cmove for complex optimizations like copy prop (althought
IMO it would be even simple to consider cmove for ssa based
optimizations). And i think its also no real problem for instruction
scheduling.

The only problem I see it with local register allocation. Maybe its
would be possible to detect more cmoves if we do it after we assigned
all registers.

But the current version has one big advantage, and thats why i have done
it that way. It works on the tree presentation. Here is a example:

if (v == true) {
	x = a*b+c;
}

at tree level its easy to detect this, because the whole expression is
just one tree (ar just a few trees if you want to detect more complex
cases):

STLOC (x, ADD (MULT(a,b)), c)

After instruction selection its a list of instruction:

r1 = a * b;
r2 = r1 + c;
mov x, r2

Well, that list of instructions can be much more complex, for example if
the expression is more complex, or when the local register allocator
spill and reloads variables.

So I dont really have an idea howto detect cmoves on this level.
