Oh, I considered &quot;In the beginning there was nothing&quot; a symbolic phrase,
referring too the fact that there was no working .Net implementation for
Unix, because MS only implemented it on MS-Windows.

Anyways - i still cant see that we claimed mono was first - that is just
an arbitrary interpretation.

&gt;<i> The author and publishers were suprised to hear about this issue at all

&gt;<i> I find the statements about pnet on the mono webpage less than

</I>
Well, I am also unable to find any Information about mono on the pnet
home page, so I guess this is quite normal. A Web page about a project
contains information about this specific project, and not about other
projects. Just like a &quot;Mono&quot; book contains information about mono, and
not about pnet.
