<PRE>Hi everyone,

	A few weeks ago Miguel sent a message to the list about trying to set
up a new unified build system for MCS. With some help I've made a
prototype that we would like to integrate in the next week or so, but
I'd like some feedback before imposing it on everyone.

	The main new features are:

		* One Makefile per directory
		* Same build system for Windows and Linux
		* Common set of $(RUNTIME) and $(MCS) variables
		  to make configuration easy
		* Generic support for recursive making and disting

	I built a tarball from yesterday morning's CVS and posted it to
<A HREF="http://www.newton.cx/~peter/files/mcs-0.24.99.tar.gz">http://www.newton.cx/~peter/files/mcs-0.24.99.tar.gz</A> (4.2 megs, MD5 of
fabf19957e64261a1c0b10d551b8ba5)

	If you're interested, please download the tarball and poke around and
see if it behaves how you expect. I probably missed some of the subtler
customizations to each library, so mail me if you have any issues.
Patches are appreciated, of course :-); look through `README.makefiles'
for my attempt at explaining things.

	Now, I only have a Linux box; Gonzalo tells me that things build
more-or-less on Windows, but I'd especially like the input from Windows
users on how things work for them. But I'm hoping that everyone will
give it a try so they don't get any unpleasant surprises when we make
the switchover.

	Thanks,
		Peter
