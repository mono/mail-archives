Yes.. but not every application, yet.

</I>
Most likely, no. It will probably take less long (and is, IMHO, better)
to rewrite those ActiveX controls in .NET than to wait for Mono to have
support for them through for example wine or a commercial COM+
implementation on Unix.

&gt;<i> or we need pure managed code?

&gt;<i> 3. As we are targetting Windows and Unix systems for our products,

I would also like to point out that a few NameSpaces like System.Drawing
and System.Windows.Forms are not ready yet. If you want to make sure
that your GUI applications are platform independant then take a look at
SWT and at this moment stay away from System.Windows.Forms. Most ASP.NET
stuff already works ... so aspx and websites in .NET will most likely
already work with Mono or will work someday. Visual Basic.NET
applications work or will work someday .. and if you want to know if
some very specific NameSpace in the Framework is already supported you
can visit the website. Also note that you can put your programmers on
the job of getting that NameSpace supported in Mono ;)!
