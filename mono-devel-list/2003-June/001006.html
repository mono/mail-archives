<PRE>Dear Mono Hackers,

I was wondering if anyone of you has reviewed the new German book :
&quot;Mono: .NET-kompatible Anwendungen mit dem Open Source-Framework&quot;

<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/books.html">http://www.go-mono.com/books.html</A>

It is stating that when the mono project was started,
there was nothing at all. &quot;Am anfang war nichts.&quot;

It has no mention of the dotgnu project, or the pnet work done by rhys
before the mono project was started. I was quite suprised about this,
and wrote to the authors who said that the book was reviewed by the
mono team.

It is quite suprising to me that such a grave mistake slipped in. 
I cannot find any mention of the fact that the pnet project was started
first on the web page. There does not seem to be any objective account
of what pnet is or its goals. 

It must be embarassing to allow such mistaken history to be portrayed,
but it seems to be the InformationsPolitik of the Mono project.

I was wondering if anyone cares to comment on this?

thanks,
mike
