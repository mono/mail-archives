<PRE>I'll see if I can change my hack to make things fixed size on HP into
something cleaner and combine it with my other changes (when I get them
postable).

&gt;<i> &gt; understand). Basically all mappings need to be consistent across all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; processes. I have made things work by hacking out all of the remapping
</I>that
&gt;<i> &gt; happens in the shared handle processing and just allocating some fixed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; chunks (which I presume is what was happening in 0.24 when this worked).
</I>I
&gt;<i> &gt; suspect that what has to happen in order to grow the shared mapped chunk
</I>is
&gt;<i> &gt; that every process has to unmap it, the file needs to be grown, and then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; every process remaps it as the new size - not that I have tried this
</I>because
&gt;<i> &gt; I haven't fully understood what is going on - and I have no idea whether
</I>the
&gt;<i> &gt; current protocol between clients and daemon can support this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The file that is grown is the scratch memory space, which is a sort of
</I>&gt;<i> malloc arena that can be shared between processes.  The actual handle
</I>&gt;<i> data files are always a fixed size, and more are created as needed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What I'd like to know is a few things: what happens if the shared handle
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stuff is disabled? what doesn't work?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only real loss of functionality at the moment when shared memory
</I>&gt;<i> support is disabled is process forking.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If it is necessary is it reasonable to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have some configuration where the shared areas are just allocated at
</I>fixed
&gt;<i> &gt; size and left alone after startup - at least on HP? What limits would
</I>thie
&gt;<i> &gt; cause? Or perhaps things could be changed to use multiple files rather
</I>than
&gt;<i> &gt; ones that grow and new files are allocated as needed which would avoid
</I>the
&gt;<i> &gt; remapping problem as only new mappings would need adding?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The handle data files do this.  I didn't do this for the scratch file,
</I>&gt;<i> because data is always copied from it not referenced.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It should be possible to disable the file growing code on HP without
</I>&gt;<i> losing much.  The scratch space might run out, leading to some odd
</I>&gt;<i> failures under load, but that should be all.
