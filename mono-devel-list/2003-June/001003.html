<PRE>Hey guys,

As you may know, I am running the Rotor Test Suite (found under
/test/bcl/system in the sscli directory). I noticed that there are many
differences between our GetHashCode methods and the ones in Microsoft's
corlib.dll. This causes many of the Rotor tests to fail. Some examples
of items that are failing are the GUID stuff and the char tests.

It would be helpful for my testing to change our implementation to use
the same methods as Rotor to obtain the hashcode of structures. This is
not hard to do, especially since the license to Rotor allows us to take
a look at the way they do it, take pseudo code notes, and make an
implementation of our own. Does anyone have any strong feelings (either
way), about this issue? Could I get an OK/Not OK from a few of the
Ximian people? Of course, I am volunteering to make these changes, and
would be happy to have my code reviewed.

-- Ben
