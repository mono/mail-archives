The file that is grown is the scratch memory space, which is a sort of
malloc arena that can be shared between processes.  The actual handle
data files are always a fixed size, and more are created as needed.

</I>
The only real loss of functionality at the moment when shared memory
support is disabled is process forking.

&gt;<i> If it is necessary is it reasonable to
</I>&gt;<i> have some configuration where the shared areas are just allocated at fixed
</I>&gt;<i> size and left alone after startup - at least on HP? What limits would thie

</I>&gt;<i> ones that grow and new files are allocated as needed which would avoid the
</I>&gt;<i> remapping problem as only new mappings would need adding?
</I>
The handle data files do this.  I didn't do this for the scratch file,
because data is always copied from it not referenced.

It should be possible to disable the file growing code on HP without
losing much.  The scratch space might run out, leading to some odd
failures under load, but that should be all.
