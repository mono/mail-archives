I got the impression from the book that there was no other free dotnet
implementation, not that the code of the mono was zero to begin with. 

The author and publishers were suprised to hear about this issue at all
, and said they would change it. Obviously they think it is an issue.

I find the statements about pnet on the mono webpage less than
informative, and i think that there should be a more objective account
of the situation.
