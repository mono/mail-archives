<PRE>Ratan , we are in the same position we are looking at mono to develop all of our crossplatform code - we see mono and .net being revolutionary for desktop development.

beaware thought that although it is possible to develop c# code on ms and linux, there are currently limitations with respect to the gui type functionalty were use to in ms. I am banking on the fact that the tools were developing in ms at the moment will be able to be ported to mono within the next twelve months. we expect a few minor hurdles but then nothing is perfect. 

our idea situation is to develop on linux(any mono supported arch) and deply multiplatform, risc, powerpc, sparc and, x86, AMD64 , in a situation where legacy win32 is nolonger relivent. Hopefully gtk and mono will provide this for us. but saying that the power of mono is in the libraries, and i expect these will develop over time to include native rather than wraped gui widgets.
