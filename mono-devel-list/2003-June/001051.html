<PRE>MessageHi!

Since Mono 0.24 the TcpChannel is compatible with MS.NET, at least for what we've been able to try. Please, try it. I'll be glad to help solving the issues that arise.

Subject: [Mono-devel-list] Making .NET Remoting compatible between Mono and Microsoft.NET


In the Mono Handbook in the chapter on Remoting, it states that &quot;The TcpChannel is working, but it is currently not compatible with MS' tcp channel&quot;.  

This is something that is standing as a roadblock for some proof of concept testing that we are trying to do with Mono.  We would like to look into what is necessary to make this work across platforms and hopefully contribute to the project.

Can anyone give us a primer on what may be wrong and the best way for us to work toward a solution? 

Thanks,

Bob Craig
