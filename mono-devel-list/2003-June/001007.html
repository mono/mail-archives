Yes, I reviewed the book.

&gt;<i> &quot;Mono: .NET-kompatible Anwendungen mit dem Open Source-Framework&quot;

OK, I will try to translate that section:

------------------------------------------
1.1.1: In the beginning there was nothing

In the beginning there was nothing - approximately this was the
situation until recently. In the meantime Mono developed with high
speed, and the developers implemented more and more functions and
classes.
----------------------------------------

&gt;<i> It has no mention of the dotgnu project, or the pnet work done by rhys
</I>&gt;<i> before the mono project was started. I was quite suprised about this,
</I>&gt;<i> and wrote to the authors who said that the book was reviewed by the
</I>&gt;<i> mono team.
</I>
The book is called &quot;Mono&quot;.

It is not called &quot;DotGnu&quot; and and not &quot;PNet&quot;. Its also not called &quot;The
History of .Net implementations on Unix&quot;. 

&gt;<i> It is quite suprising to me that such a grave mistake slipped in.
</I>
I cant see any mistake. A book about mono should talk about mono -
nothing else.

&gt;<i> I cannot find any mention of the fact that the pnet project was started
</I>&gt;<i> first on the web page. There does not seem to be any objective account
</I>&gt;<i> of what pnet is or its goals. 
</I>
Well, feel free to write a book about PNet. You can mention all those
things there.

&gt;<i> It must be embarassing to allow such mistaken history to be portrayed,
</I>&gt;<i> but it seems to be the InformationsPolitik of the Mono project.
</I>
What? The book does not claim that mono was first - where did you read
that?
