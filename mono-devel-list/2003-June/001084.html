<PRE>Message&gt; Hi all,
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been experimenting with MS.NET &lt;-&gt; Mono 0.24 compatibility, and I've
</I>seen the following two issues.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1)       MS.Net has been at version 1.1 for some time now.  In MS.Net 1.1
</I>Microsoft increased their
&gt;<i> default security settings so that ObjRefs were not allowed as parameters
</I>on remoted calls.  Among
&gt;<i> other things, this causes runtime failure of the sample code in the
</I>&quot;Remoting&quot; area of the Mono
&gt;<i> Handbook.  You can get around this by setting your deserialization level
</I>to &quot;Full&quot; instead of the default
&gt;<i> &quot;Low&quot;.  See
</I><A HREF="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/changeinfo/Backwards1.0to1.1/default.aspx#00000153">http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/changeinfo/Backwards1.0to1.1/default.aspx#00000153</A>
&gt;<i> for more on this issue.
</I>
This behavior should be easy to implement. I put it in my TODO list.

&gt;<i> 2)       Ref and out parameters don't seem to work at all across mono
</I>remoting boundaries.  They do
&gt;<i> work in MS.NET.
</I>
Hmm, this should work. Maybe something is broken in the runtime. I'll review
it.

Thanks David!

Hi!

Since Mono 0.24 the TcpChannel is compatible with MS.NET, at least for what
we've been able to try. Please, try it. I'll be glad to help solving the
issues that arise.

Microsoft.NET

In the Mono Handbook in the chapter on Remoting, it states that &quot;The
TcpChannel is working, but it is currently not compatible with MS' tcp
channel&quot;.

This is something that is standing as a roadblock for some proof of concept
testing that we are trying to do with Mono.  We would like to look into what
is necessary to make this work across platforms and hopefully contribute to
the project.

Can anyone give us a primer on what may be wrong and the best way for us to
work toward a solution?

Thanks,

Bob Craig
