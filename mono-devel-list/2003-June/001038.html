Yes. We don't want to add workarounds for broken tests.

Which part of &quot;those are broken tests&quot; do you don't understand?
Say, suppose at some point rotor and the commercial MS framework
use two different hashcode implementations for string (I assume now they
are the same) and then a test suite is published for rotor and one for
the commercial framework. Are you going to commit to cvs different
versions of GetHashCode each time you run the test suites? That's
stupid.
The right thing to do is to add to our own test suite the tests to make
it more complete. Looking at the rotor test suite is only useful to see
what kinds of tests we may be missing. The tests you see there need to
be scrutinized and checked for correctness: don't assume that they are
correct if rotor passes them!

&gt;<i> I also think that the tests could provide some great marketing power.

</I>
Yeah, imagine the comments, we run 100% of the tests, even the ones that
are broken! That's very nice advertising.
Since they didn't release the test suite with a license that all of us can use,
I much prefer being able to say we pass 100% of our test suite than
being able to say we passed some random test suite after making
nonsensical changes to our sources.

Dude, in the real world, design != implementation != documentation.
Even if something is designed to match a spec, that doesn't mean that it
does. This is Reality check 101.
Plus, the standard doesn't define how GetHashCode is implemented.

... and you're interpreting them in a way that may not be correct, such
as assuming that the one that reads the sources and takes pseudocode
notes can be the one that writes the code for mono.
We want to stay on the safe side and we don't care if others take
another path.
