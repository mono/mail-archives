If the tests break because of the different GetHashCode() algorithm, the
tests are broken.

You can certainly make those kind of changes to your local cvs tree,
but those changes should not be committed. The right thing to do is
to fix the tests to not depend on a particular GetHashCode()
implementation. As for looking at the rotor code, since you're not a
lawyer, nobody should trust what you say about what the rotor license
allows to do. We should stay on the safe side and pseudo code notes
are not, unless done by someone external to mono, IMHO.
