This issue is dear to me too.

The Debian Mono page indicates there is a workaround. A third binary that 
does a more conclusive check and then starts either mono or wine.

Which would mean that the kernel binfmt support has short-comings that can 
only be overcome by doing it in userspace. My first thought is that the 
binfmt_misc kernel-support should be fixed to be more useful.

Since there will not be a good solution soon, I would propose the 
following standard (and I took the liberty to add it to the Developer FAQ 
page in the Wiki already).

The proposal is to have a shell wrapper with the same name as the .Net 
binary, with the '.exe' part and would consist of the following 2 lines:

	#!/bin/sh
	exec mono &quot;$0&quot;.exe $@

Ofcourse we could verify some things in this script (check if mono can be 
called, if the executable exists, etc...) But I would keep it as simple as 
possible, I've tested the output in various circumstances and the 
error-output was in each case very clear about the problem.

Kind regards,
