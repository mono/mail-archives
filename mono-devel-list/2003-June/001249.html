<PRE>I sent out an email last week about XSP and MS.Net.  I was basically stating
that XSP is pretty independent of mono and should be able to run on MS.Net.
It does compile, but there are some strange run-time exceptions that imply
to me that there is some fundamental difference in the ASP.Net runtime
environment underneath it.

I'm curious if anyone cares?  Please let me know if you need more detail.

</I>&gt;<i> It seems that there isn't any functionality from the SimpleWorkerRequest
</I>&gt;<i> that is used in XSP, so i was wondering why you couldn't just inherit from
</I>&gt;<i> the HttpWorkerRequest?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I tried hitting the test directory after making these changes, and
</I>&gt;<i> everything still seemed to work.. including web_xml.aspx. =)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> comments?
