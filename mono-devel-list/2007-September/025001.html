I'm just saying: monocharge and get-monolite are tools that can be used
in some cases to solve some issues. But they are not guaranteed to work
(there is no versioning info) and they require someone that knows what
to do in any case. They aren't of much use to confused users, because
any time they hit an issue with them (see above some of the reasons)
they get even more confused.

There is only one way to fix a mono svn build when the user broke his
mono install: build from a released tarball and rebuild from a clean svn.
Any other suggestion can only generate frustration and confusion, imho.

That said: for this case where a user wants to build mono on linux from
svn without having a linux system the only sane option is to use a
prepackaged binary.
The next time, someone comes around and asks to build mono without
touching a keyboard, and blaming it to the mono build system:)
The binary can be easily done by mostly anyone hanging on
#mono on irc by doing make install -k prefix=/tmp/mono-install and
making a tarball of the resulting dir which can be untarred in
/usr/local on the target system.
Thanks.
