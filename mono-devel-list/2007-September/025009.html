<PRE>Hi,

I'm one of the Qyoto devs and have just come across this thread. 
First off, I'm glad that even companies consider Qyoto an option for the GUI 
by now and that quite some people have heard about it.
To be honest, we haven't tested Qyoto on Windows yet, but it should work 
pretty flawlessly. On Linux and Mac OS X at least it works well. GUI's are 
designed with the normal Qt Designer. Code can be generated with the 
resulting .ui files and a program called 'uics'.
For the licensing: we can use a dual-license model for Qyoto/Kimono, like it's 
done with PyQt and Qt itself: GPL for open-source apps, QPL-like for closed 
source.
For theming: Qt uses the native API on Windows/Mac as far as possible, so the 
look and feel is native.
The API of Qt is also quite stable throughout a major version, but some minor 
things might change from time to time.

To do some advertising: Qt does not only offer a GUI Toolkit, but also some 
other interesting features like SQL handling, SVG support, OpenGL support, 
D-BUS support (one feature of D-BUS is a bit buggy on Qyoto, though), 
Networking and more.
