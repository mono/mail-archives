<PRE>I much prefer the Qyoto/Kimono bindings for cross-platform because of
it's elegance and it looks much better IMHO on Windows than Gtk#. I
haven't run into /too many/ bugs (just a couple, they might have even
been resolved by now) with the Qyoto/Kimono bindings. Those are really
the only reasons why I prefer Qyoto/Kimono over Gtk#.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [1] This means that the fact that recent Gtk+/Gtk# bugs[2] on Windows 
</I>&gt;<i> have not attracted much attention, is not a good indicative for us to 
</I>&gt;<i> focus on Gtk# but rather on Kimono.
</I>&gt;<i> [2] Because of these bugs, there have been people that even had 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;community builds&quot; of Gtk# 2.10 for Windows, and we don't want to depend 
</I>&gt;<i> on that stability.
</I>&gt;<i> [3] There also have been some posts from Aaron Bockover regarding some 
</I>&gt;<i> intricacies about GTK Themes strange behaviours. Do you know if QT 
</I>&gt;<i> themes are much more elegant and bugless?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks in advance,
