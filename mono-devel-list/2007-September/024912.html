<PRE>Oops sorry Sebastien. I meant to mention that I had pulled the source
from SVN yesterday.

I'll see what I can do about the patch. Unfortunately, I'm not sure how
I persuade VS to embed the resource without giving it a namespace, so I
need to either work out how to do that first, or make sure whatever
changes I make don't break the normal build process!

Thanks for the info. I'll take the rest of my questions to the Google
group you mentioned.

Regards,
Richard

In SVN or in the 0.0.3 source tarball ?

[ Snip again ]

A Gendarme group[1] was setup recently on Google Group if you have any
further question about it.
