<PRE>Hey, I'm looking at starting some work on the serious implementation
of the System.Data.Linq namespace. After some reading and general talk
around the mono community, I've got a rough idea of how we do this,
and I'm on step one: Writing Unit Tests. I've started to do some more
research into the Linq to Sql system in general and how its exposed
API is meant to be used and how it should work. While I'm still a
little sketchy on the details of how I'm going to implement it
(Specifically the separation of what gets done in the mapping of a
datacontext and what gets done at build/run and what gets done at
actual execution (although a video[1] on linq and deferred execution
has helped make a lot more sense out of the functional programming
move that C# is making (Sorry for the WMV!) ).

Anyways, given that the only current working implementation is in
windows using VS 2008, .Net 3.5, and MS Sql server, I really would
like to be able to write the unit tests in that environment, then take
them over to linux and start the class implementation. The only
problem is how to actually work in the VS environment without making
it a horrible and impossible pain to merge my work, and still making a
sane/usable build. My concern is that VS is going to use csc for all
compiles, and I don't want there to be some licsense violation with
writing unit tests in VS. (using nunit, although I'm not really sure
how to integrate the nunit tests into the makefiles, and really would
rather spend my time writing the tests then spending hours getting a
nuanced build system to work on windows, however, if thats the only
real way to make this work, I'll do it.)

Anyways, I wanted to know if anyone else had a setup like this
working, if not, if anyone had some recommendations on a development
setup (I have equal access to Linux and Windows desktops, and vmware
on pretty much everything, so I'm open to any ideas) My main concern
right now is just getting some smooth environment where I can use the
MS edition of everything while I write the unit tests.

Thanks for any help anyone can offer!
