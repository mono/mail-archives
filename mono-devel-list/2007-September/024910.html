<PRE>Hi there,

 

Sorry for bursting in like this... but I recently stumbled upon Gendarme
and was considering using it to enforce some rather specific
requirements related to our code. (It's either a case of writing a rule
for Gendarme, creating a custom utility, or write a rule library for
FxCop, and I like open source tools better!)

 

Anyway, it seems that the VS 2005 solution files are not up to date. In
particular, the console runner does not include a reference to the
gendarme.xsl file, which results in a null reference exception when
attempting to generate an HTML report.

 

Is this something which should be fixed, or should the VS 2005 project
files be deprecated?

 

Regards,

Richard
