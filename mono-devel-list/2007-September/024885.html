<PRE>Hey! I saw that work has gotten started on the implementation of Linq
(at least the backend classes at the moment) in mono. I wanted to get
involved a bit and offer my help. While I've been using Mono for some
time now, I haven't worked on the Microsoft class libraries before,
and I had a few quick questions, and would appreciate any
advice/guidance on how to really get started.

1) With regards to working on the Linq stuff(or the Olive module in
general), is there a separate mailing list or anything that I should
subscribe to/direct discussion towards?

2) Where's a good place in the implementation to start? I see plenty
of todo tags etc. I just don't want to step on someones feet.
Furthermore, with the abundance of new code when implementing new
classes like this, what elements of deign are coordinated, and what
are just the first dev to get to it?

3) What/How much research is fair game when checking the reference
implementation? I would assume that ildasm and reflector are major
no-no's, along with any other means of decompilation. But can the MS
dll's be run in Linux without concern? I've been reading a lot over at
msdn, specifically
<A HREF="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa904594.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa904594.aspx</A>
is that a problem? (I would assume it isn't but I don't want any trouble ;) )

If this is the wrong place or time or tone or mood to be asking this
or getting involved with this extension of the class library just let
me know!
