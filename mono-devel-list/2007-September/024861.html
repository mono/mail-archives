If we have any bug with not supporting arrays with a length up to
Int32.MaxValue we should fix them, at least as far as the code is
concerned, though the GC may not actually be able to allocate them
on 32 bit systems.
If we allow sizes up to Int64.MaxValue on 64 bit system is still very
much up in the air: I haven't seen anybody else request it and my guess
is that this would be very taxing on the GC anyway.
Handling this with a define (but also a libmono soname change) would be
fine I guess. Since this is an incompatible change I would prefer not
having a configure change, though, since apparently some people monitor
our new configure options and enable them even if they don't know what
they mean:)
