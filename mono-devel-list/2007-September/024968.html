<PRE>Hi Kevin,
&gt;<i> Hey! I've started to get going on some of the System.Data.Linq work,
</I>&gt;<i> at the moment, there's not much in terms of real code to show, but
</I>&gt;<i> some initial unit tests (my first ever, sorry they're so incomplete)
</I>&gt;<i> and API updates (Get the public API more in sync with the current 3.5
</I>&gt;<i> Beta 2) and realistic implementation for some of the extension
</I>&gt;<i> methods, static methods, and helper style classes. I hope to delve
</I>&gt;<i> into Table and DataContext later this week (the real toughies) but
</I>&gt;<i> once I 'got' the whole deferred execution thing, this whole system
</I>&gt;<i> started to make a lot more sense. (Hence my writing the CompiledQuery
</I>&gt;<i> class ;) ).
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I am happy to hear that you have made good progress.
&gt;<i> Anyways, there's too much file movement to do a sane patch, and since
</I>&gt;<i> some of the new files aren't properly integrated into the build
</I>&gt;<i> system, I don't want to submit a patch, however, as I clean up the
</I>&gt;<i> code and make more progress, I'll release a branch later today, once I
</I>&gt;<i> finish cloning SVN for a local repo.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Is it really necessary to clone our SVN?
&gt;<i> Anyways, I figured I should drop in some sort of status update, at the
</I>&gt;<i> moment, the biggest hurdle for me is getting build systems to play
</I>&gt;<i> nice, conceptually, it seems easy enough, just add a makefile event
</I>&gt;<i> which outputs the VS projects and solutions. The other thing is I'm
</I>&gt;<i> currently using Resharper to run the Nunit tests, and that needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> added to the makefiles.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>This should not be hard, MWF guys have some script if you want to
automate (.sources -&gt; .csproj) conversion.
&gt;<i> Before I get in too deep, whats the policy with ChangeLogs? I'm
</I>&gt;<i> assuming some sort of comment/description of changes is required,
</I>&gt;<i> however, everyone has their specifics, and I didn't see anything in
</I>&gt;<i> the wiki. Moreover, should I be submitting individual patches for each
</I>&gt;<i> increment I complete? (for example when I finish integrating my tests
</I>&gt;<i> into the build, should I submit that patch or wait until my work is
</I>&gt;<i> 'done'. Seeing as the namespace I'm working on isn't really at risk of
</I>&gt;<i> 'breaking' I would guess that reasonable benchmarks are ok, I'm open
</I>&gt;<i> to whatever. Once I have a public branch of my work up, I'll just
</I>&gt;<i> reference that.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>The preferred way is to submit more small patches split by something 
common which
you can describe in ChangeLog. There is not much activity in olive now, but
maintaining your changes in the local repository for long time is not 
good. Anyone can
commit changes which you have already made.

Thanks
Marek
