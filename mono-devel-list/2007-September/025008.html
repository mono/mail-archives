And don't forget glade, since glade3 it's fun to make GUIs :)

Our company develops business applications using C# / Gtk# / Glade# /
gettext.
GTK+/GTK# gives us a permissable license (LGPL), a _very_ stable ABI/API
(didn't break since GTK+ 2.0, and today we are at 2.12) and workable
release cycles.
Gettext integrates very well on windows using Mono.Posix.dll, glade also
supports I18N through gettext out of the box.

Theming is indeed a bit strange/ugly in GTK+, not well documented, but
is very flexible.

Gtk# builds on windows lack behind Gtk# on linux, like there is no Gtk#
2.10 installer for windows yet. This is not really a GTK+ nor GTK#
issue, but a porting/community issue. GTK# is an official GTK+ binding
but there are no official windows ports/builds. Paco is doing them as
good and often as he can (and they are _very_ good), but there is
sometimes lag.

In total I am very happy what GTK# gives us (the company) and it works
very well.

I have no experience with QT neither Kimono.
