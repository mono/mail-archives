<PRE>Oy...that's going to be a convoluted fix. &#160;The problem is that I fire the SelectionChanged event every time the selection changes; apparently, .NET fires it once after a batch of selection-changes completes. &#160;I'll have to move the OnSelectionChanged() calls from where they are, to all of their parents, and ensure that it's only fired once. &#160;That'll take quite a bit of finagling. &#160;But the bug is fixable.

By the way, Steven, you might want to check out this bug, as it's related to
some of your contributions:
<A HREF="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=683213">https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=683213</A>

Before your patch(es), the DataGridView SelectionChanged event wasn't fired
with the test case attached to this report.
 Now, it seems it's fire twice
rather than once (despite the fact I said in the bug comments that the bug
seemed fixed). If you can't think of a way to fix this, it's alright. Just
thought I'd bring that up.
