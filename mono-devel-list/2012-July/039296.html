<PRE>Just want to add -- I was using xsp wrong on macos because i was
unfamiliar with it.  I just tonight tried it on linux with a fully
downloaded version of a website i did (ghettogarage.net) using asp.net
4, and it worked relatively well in reproducing an exact image of the
windows hosted site (it's not a very complicated site, but it uses ms
sql server and some other things which were easy in .net and i'm glad
worked with mono).

Apparently, while html files which i was testing can be hosted with
xsp, asp.net files may have been required to reach the debug points i
was trying to reach.

So, it may have been using my development version of mono, i don't
know yet.  i have to transfer a copy of the site to my mac before i
can really test.  If it works, i might pick up some of the bug reports
on the web aspects of mono as well to work on.  I might try doing that
(the transfer) overnight as with the pictures and (inaccessible due to
laziness on my part) videos take time to transfer.

However, again, if anyone has any idea what i should do about the
syntax errors in the configure script on MacOS, I'd appreciate help.
