<PRE>Hi Rodrigo,

I have played with the MONO_INLINELIMIT env variable (just discovered in the mono code a couple of days ago).  It solved some of my other inlining issues.   The AggressiveInlining option should be helpful for methods in 4.5 (I'm still on 4.0), though I don't believe the attribute can be used on properties, even though they are effectively methods (or am I wrong here).

I noticed the code in method-to-ir.c, the other day re: excluding code that needs a class constructor to be run.   I am not clear on what this means exactly.   Are you referring to:

classes with static constructors
classes with non-empty constructors
something else? 

You mentioned &quot;we don't inline methods that call other methods&quot; and suggested might be the case in my code.   I am simply indexing the get method in:

public override double this[int i]
{
	get { return _data[i]; }
	set { _data[i]  = value; }
}

I thought that since this is an override, though on a leaf / sealed class, perhaps mono could not handle this case.   Not sure where indexing on this property would hit the &quot;call another method&quot; case.

If I understand this better, I can investigate / suggest some new feature re: inlining.

Thanks
Jonathan

</I>&gt;<i> We don't do inlining when generics are involved. Doesn't look to be your case;
</I>&gt;<i> And, finally, we don't inline methods that call other methods (including constructors).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The last restriction does look to be your issue. We do it due to a pair of issues, first because it produces broken stacktraces
</I>&gt;<i> and because it breaks calls that check caller assembly. Both can be fixed if mono had support for inlining maps.

</I>&gt;<i> My suggestion is that you play with MONO_INLINELIMIT and AgressiveInlining. This can be reported as a feature request.
