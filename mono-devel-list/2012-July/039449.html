Wish I kept that off list.

Sorry - I am bipolar and have mood swings.  I must have stopped myself
from sending something similar about 3-5 times before.

Please ignore any 'woe is me' messages - I am not quitting.  I finally
got home, and my linux machine is working fine with my home network.

Like i said, i've learned a lot doing this.

I really have to look at the fix i submitted on the list more
carefully.  I am not home and should have time, but we're still
unpacking and stuff, may take a few days to settle down.

If no one applied the fix i submitted on the list, that is ok, it may be
no better than the original problem anyway.  I need to think more
carefully about the fix.

There is an easier way to solve this problem than i idd it originally. 
I just remember when I was looking at the code originally there was a
mixture of recursive areas and non-recursive areas, so i cannot
guarantee that i'll be at the same level of recursion when i would want
to 'back track', but i know i can come up with a better solution than i
did for 2663 which doesn't add too much slowness as the current solution
does.  The benefit of the current solution is i got it to 'work' where
before it failed.

</I>&gt;<i>         This change introduced a OneIdlePerThread unit test that has
</I>&gt;<i>         never worked for me.  All I get is the following exception:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         System.InvalidOperationException : Cannot call Invoke or
</I>&gt;<i>         BeginInvoke on a control until the window handle is created
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Patch #18 fixes that by creating a Form type that calls
</I>&gt;<i>         CreateHandle() in its constructor.  But now the unit test
</I>&gt;<i>         hangs hard in Mono!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         I created a project with the unit-test, and when run in Mono,
</I>&gt;<i>         it hangs hard; selecting &quot;Run -&gt; Pause&quot; in MonoDevelop hangs
</I>&gt;<i>         MonoDevelop, and the debugged process chews up 100% of the CPU
</I>&gt;<i>         time
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         I ran the project in .NET, and instead of a hang, I get this
</I>&gt;<i>         exception:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         System.InvalidOperationException: Cross-threaded operation not
</I>&gt;<i>         valid: Control '' accessed from a thread other than the thread
</I>&gt;<i>         it was created on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Patch #18a fixes that by moving the creation of form2 into the
</I>&gt;<i>         right thread.  Now the unit test passes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         So patch #18a can be checked in, but note that patch #18
</I>&gt;<i>         demonstrates that Mono hangs in a situation where .NET throws
</I>&gt;<i>         an exception.
