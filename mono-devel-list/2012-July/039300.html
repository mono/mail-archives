I read your message about an hour too late.  What I wound up doing:  I
had already installed the alpha version of mono from the website
download.  It installed to /usr/bin.  So I copied my monolocal directory
to /usr (From mono-local-install dir: cp -R * /usr)..  Did what i needed
to do i guess.  I solved the problem i was trying to fix anyway.  Turns
out the problem wasn't 100% my code, but code which i depended on
working correctly which was not.  Small oversight in the caller to the
function i modified, that's fixed now in my pull request.
