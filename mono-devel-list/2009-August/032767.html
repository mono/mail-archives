</I>&gt;<i> &quot;work&quot; when using the Design stuff, it just won't work the same way as

</I>&gt;<i> Afaik currently most of the Web stuff in System.Design is only stubbed out

</I>&gt;<i> be minimal for *web* applications.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Nevertheless if mono-web does not include System.Design then it
basically beaks MS.NET compatibility. Because then the user will have
to know &quot;Oh wait. There is mono-designtime I also have to install&quot;.
And the worse is that those problems will be very very difficult to
track down (missing dynamic dependency).

So instead of breaking the out of the box experience so to speak, what
about creating a mono-web-lite package without the
System.Design/winforms dependency (= don't install System.Design)?
That way apps that don't have any direct or indirect deps on
System.Design (e.g. Tomboy) can put a dependency on mono-web-lite
instead of on mono-web. An idea I just had.
