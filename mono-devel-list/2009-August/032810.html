<PRE>Hello everyone,

I've managed to embed Mono in a c++ program without trouble (under MS Windows) but I would like to optimize this a little...

As I want to do a &quot;standalone application&quot;, I used the &quot;mono_set_dirs()&quot; function and copied the whole of &quot;lib&quot; and &quot;etc&quot; directories from the mono installation dir into my own directory, so my program is totally independent from mono &quot;program files&quot; dir.

But the lib &amp; etc directories are quite huge, and contains lots of small files....

 - Is there a &quot;guideline&quot; allowing to know which files are needed and which one I can discard in my directories ? Do I just have to manually identify the references my assembly have and delete every other file ?

 - Is it possible to &quot;fuse&quot; all these &quot;lib &amp; etc&quot; files directly inside the .EXE file or into one big external &quot;resources&quot; file ? I would like to hide all these small files and limit the risk for an user to damage or hijack my program by removing/replacing the libraries in these directories...

Perhaps there is even simplier ways... How could I have as little files as possible in my program folder ?

Thanks in advance,
Regards


      
</PRE>
