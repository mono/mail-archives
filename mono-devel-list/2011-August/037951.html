<PRE>I understand your points, Miguel, but it sucks not to be able to be
consistent / compatible with .NET here.
I know it's not possible to get numbers, but how many Mono OSX apps do you
think currently rely on this feature vs how many Silverlight / .NET apps
could benefit from this change? And it's not just about Silverlight
compatibility, but about adopting a predictable and now documented behavior.
Keeping in mind that .NET in general has many more users than Mono does, I
do not understand why the Mono team is sometimes reluctant to break backward
compatibility with older Mono versions.

And you don't have to break compatibility brutally, you can do it in a soft
way. If you release Mono 3.0 but clearly state in the release notes to watch
out about this, I don't think there is that much harm done. You could even
make the new behavior opt in at first, warn programmers about the new
behavior, and after a year or two, make the new behavior the default.

I'm not personally affected by this issue, by the way, but I value
consistent or optimal solutions over &quot;bad&quot; decisions for the sake of
backward compatibility. Look at Java, doing everything toward backward
compatibility (like the way they implemented generics)... I think this is
short sighted. Several years later, it doesn't matter anymore whether they'd
have broken compatibility with previous versions or not. What matters now is
that we have an inferior product because of their decision. It may have
looked like this may have saved them some users back then, but what about
now?

The way I see it, it's a choice between &quot;pissing off some people a lot now
and be done with it&quot; vs &quot;pissing off some people for eternity&quot;. I'd go for
choice one. I reckon I'm a bit of an Utopian.

End of rant, sorry if it came off as annoying. :)
