<PRE>Hi, I am new to Mono, but becoming a big fan quickly (more detail
below regarding what I am doing with it).  To get right to the point,
however, I would appreciate advice on how to *programmatically* set
the value of a variable that can be seen inside the Evaluator, e.g.,

	var temp = Evaluator.Evaluate(&quot;...&quot;);
	Evaluator.PutVar(&quot;x&quot;, temp); // so such method exists!
	Evaluator.Run(&quot;... x ...&quot;);

I would like the value of x in the third line above to be the object
that was returned from the call to Evaluate in the first line.  Now,
obviously, if the value of temp is a number or a string, I can just
concatenate it into the string argument to Run, e.g.,
&quot;...&quot;+temp+&quot;...&quot;.   But that doesn't work if temp is some other data
structure.

It is tantalizing that Evaluator has a GetVars() method (even though
it returns a string)---so it is indeed keeping track of the defined
variables!   Btw, I wouldn't mind if I needed to initialize x with a
var statement at the start.

So I guess, for the long term, I am asking for a new PutVar method;  I
am also hoping for some kind of workaround in the short term, so I can
finish my project (see below).  Is there some way to directly access
the global Mono environment (from C#) to simply set a variable?

Thanks in advance,

-Chuck

P.S. My larger project is converting an AI system for controlling
NPC's, written in Java, for use in Unity3d.   I have used ikvmc (see
ikvm.net) successfully to do the Java translation, but there is a
remaining problem with changing the embedded scripting language to C#
(to easily access Unity3d game state---like the REPL at
<A HREF="https://github.com/MrJoy/UnityREPL">https://github.com/MrJoy/UnityREPL</A>), which leads this email.
