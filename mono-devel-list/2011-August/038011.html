<PRE>Rodrigo,

The class based object part of the test is definitely GC sensitive.  However, I and others have noted a performance drop for the struct based test (the other test in this simple benchmark), which should not be impacted by GC.   I did two tests of the struct-based approach, one with 2.6.x OSX and 2.10.x and there was a consistent difference.    

I also have a linux box, so am trying to build 2.10.x (as the packages available are 2.6.x).   I expect, as others have found, that the struct performance will be lower in 2.10.x, even on linux.

I will post results later if I manage to build this successfully.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> I don't know whether this may be because of one of the following:

</I>&gt;<i> Note that I tried this with separate compilations with mcs -optimize+  on both environments as well as running the same exe on both.

</I>&gt;<i> I can live with slower performance on OSX, but want to make sure that linux and windows versions of mono 2.10.x have the performance of 2.6.7 or better.
