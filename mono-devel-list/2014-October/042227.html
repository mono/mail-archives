<PRE>Hi All,

Just another quick update.

Some potentially amazing news.  I've managed to get a fairly large MVC
5.2/WebAPI running on mono!  That is out of the box, without any special
versions of dll's (other than removing the Microsoft.Web.Infrastructure.dll
I think.

So, there are a few outstanding PR's that need to reviewed and merged, but
the end is in sight! Special thanks go out to Kornel Pal for implementing
the HttpTaskAsyncHandler as this was going to be a big uphill struggle for
me so you saved me a lot of time.

So the list of PR's that need reviewing (not including ones already
reviewed and merged) in order to make this work are:

PR1163: <A HREF="https://github.com/mono/mono/pull/1163">https://github.com/mono/mono/pull/1163</A>

*This is done by Mike Morano and has recently been re-done without the
offending code (now added in my PR1363).*
PR1349: <A HREF="https://github.com/mono/mono/pull/1349">https://github.com/mono/mono/pull/1349</A>

*This is the machine key work, and needs a small tweak before it can be
merged that I will do this week.*
PR1363: <A HREF="https://github.com/mono/mono/pull/1363">https://github.com/mono/mono/pull/1363</A>

*Another of mine with the MembershipPasswordAttribute*
PR1365: <A HREF="https://github.com/mono/mono/pull/1365">https://github.com/mono/mono/pull/1365</A>

*This is Kornel Pal's around the HttpTaskAsyncHandler, and Miguel has said
he'll take a look at it.*
PR1370: <A HREF="https://github.com/mono/mono/pull/1370">https://github.com/mono/mono/pull/1370</A>

*Small one implementing a default of the ReadEntityBodyMode*
PR1371: <A HREF="https://github.com/mono/mono/pull/1371">https://github.com/mono/mono/pull/1371</A>

*Another small one, implementing the ClientDisconnectedToken*
PR1372: <A HREF="https://github.com/mono/mono/pull/1372">https://github.com/mono/mono/pull/1372</A>

*A final small one around the GetBuffer* methods in the httprequest.*
There is 1 final small piece that either myself of Chris Carroll will get
done this week which is around the AppendTrailing slash and lowercaseUrls
properties in RouteBase class.  We just need to put the implementation
together.

Anyway, after applying all of these, my large WebAPI solution not only
compiles, but it also runs!

If you want to checkout what it looks like with all the patches applied,
that would be great, I'd love to have some more information on whether it
does work.  I'm sure there will still be bugs, but if it works mostly, then
bug fixing is easy (famous last words).

Thanks for everyone's help.
