<PRE>Hi Miguel,

The code that I'm referring to here is that of the aspnetwebstack on
codeplex.  That is to say that they are not something where you can remove
the code and recompile (unless there as a specific mono implementation
which is not ideal).  The goal is to have the compiled dlls that are
available on nuget work, without tweaking to a person's application.

I'll have a look and see if I can see where it would be used, but still as
you've said on one of my pulls, a half done implementation is better than
none.

Having the application throw a missing method exception should not be the
recommended approach when we can add the property and default it to false.

Thanks, and please don't think that things won't getting better with my
reviews.  I'm learning what you want so I can review better and help reduce
the burden on you and your staff.

Martin
