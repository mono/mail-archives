<PRE>Hey,

You could start by &quot;faking&quot; the async controllers for now.   This would be
enough to support WebAPI, even if behind the scenes it is entirely sync.

This buys us some time to research the subject.   There were a few
interesting posts on MSDN, and the blogs about how this works a couple of
years ago, so those would be great research material.

I can assist (in my copious spare time) with this, as I wrote chunks of the
current ASP.NET pipeline with Gonzalo.

Miguel

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, is there anybody else who would be willing to donate to this (I'm
