<PRE>
&gt;&gt;<i> From a productivity perspective and for risk management for testing and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deployment I wish to be able to develop and debug under Visual Studio
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with Mono as a framework option.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'd like to be able to do that with Mono on Windows as a check that no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issues come up between running on the .NET framework and running on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mono.
</I>&gt;<i> You can do that.  Don't need to build mono on windows - just do a normal mono-for-windows install - I haven't done it in a while, but there's a plugin to run your code against the mono runtime instead of .Net.  I'm pretty sure it's free - might even be a standard extension you can find with the Extension manager.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
But this is exactly the point. I can't :-/ I wish I could.

I have Mono 3.8.0 built for multiple Embedded Linux platforms out of
Yocto and I want to use 3.8.0 on Windows in the development cycle, not
3.2.3 from September 2013.

I wish to be running the same releases of code for
development/debug/deployment in as far as is possible to catch any
potential problems.

But nobody seems to have ownership of at present of keeping Windows
binary releases in sync with Mono source/binary releases, which surely
isn't a major task?

&gt;&gt;<i> In addition I'd like to be able to remote debug to Embedded Linux with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Visual Studio - which  I used to be able to do with Xamarin's Monotools
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Server before it disappeared.
</I>&gt;<i> Again, you don't need to build mono to do this.  But this feature I'm sure, is not free.  It's included in Xamarin Business.  They offer Visual Studio support as one of the features of Xam Bus.  It allows you to do remote debugging with VS running a mono app on some remote mac or linux mono machine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If the MonoTools plugin was still available I'd be happy to pay for
it... Perhaps I may investigate Xam Bus but for now if the alternate
OpenSource plugin will do the job for me that would make me very happy :)

Cheers,

Alex
