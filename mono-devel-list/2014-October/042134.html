</I>&gt;<i> And that's impossible without some level of time-investment in engagement
</I>&gt;<i> - such as having somebody respond to bug reports even if this is to say
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;sorry this is unmaintained - your problem&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Seems like you just volunteered to do this for all the bugs that come in
for Windows.Forms :-)

If only life was that simple :) To reiterate though, I'd have tried to fix
&gt;<i> this if I knew where to begin looking, as I have applications here that
</I>&gt;<i> need System.Windows.Forms and which I can't simply abandon or rewrite.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Time to hire a System.Windows.Forms hacker :-)

Presumably Microsoft still views as System.Windows.Forms as maintained? Or
&gt;<i> have they abandoned it too?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You will have to ask them.

Windows.Forms is a wrapper around the Win32 UI API.   So for them, the
maintenance means &quot;keep the wrapper working for our underlying API&quot;.   Mono
had to reimplement everything from the ground up, and simulate many pieces
of Win32.   So it is a much more complex problem for Mono than it is for
Microsoft.

Is there a place where I can see a matrix of what components the Mono
&gt;<i> project views as unmaintained and therefore what kind of .NET applications
</I>&gt;<i> may no longer run under the current release of Mono?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
There are a few on the web site, but they are likely not up to date.

You can submit pull request for updating the web site.
