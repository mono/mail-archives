<PRE>Hi Guys,

I took it upon myself to try and get a build up and running on Appveyor
yesterday. Please have a look at <A HREF="https://github.com/mika76/mono">https://github.com/mika76/mono</A> and
<A HREF="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mmihajlovic/mono">https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mmihajlovic/mono</A> - so far the only thing
I've edited is the appveyor.yml file and the actual a[[veyor settings.

At the moment it is installing cygwin and packages and running the visual
studio msbuild file - which seems not to work - it fails with &quot;compiler out
of heap space&quot; error.

If the msbuild does not pan out, the cygwin build can always be attempted
as well.

If anybody wants to help, let me know and I'll make you a contributor on
the repository.

Cheers,
Mladen

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I understand/agree that facilitating development on Windows is a complex
</I>&gt;<i> task. I've seen some of the emails over time and can well imagine it's
</I>&gt;<i> complex and invasive to the existing build system. People start the work,
</I>&gt;<i> but I''ve not seen anything come out of it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I take my scope as something much simpler, which is just to facilitate
</I>&gt;<i> building Mono on Windows from scratch, on a vanilla Windows platform,
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps defined as Windows 7/8.1 x32/x64 or whatever, then I think that's
</I>&gt;<i> much more achievable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have been looking at this since 3.4.0 and the main issues I have
</I>&gt;<i> encountered were having the right dependencies, idiosyncracies of the build
</I>&gt;<i> tools, and issues with releases such as missing files/problems with Cygwin
</I>&gt;<i> headers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps very few of us are fit for purpose when it comes to actually
</I>&gt;<i> _contributing_ to Mono, but I can well understand that the first step an
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSource developer wants to make is to compile a project from source and
</I>&gt;<i> run up the results.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can also understand the frustration when you've spent a couple of days
</I>&gt;<i> on this and just keep encountering problems. People can then give up in
</I>&gt;<i> frustration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even the longest journey begins with a single step and it strikes me that
</I>&gt;<i> it would be a useful thing to facilitate newbies building on Windows to get
</I>&gt;<i> them going on that journey, even if that's just by documenting issues they
</I>&gt;<i> will encounter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The emails I get from individuals show me that when they do have the
</I>&gt;<i> information they need to build Mono, and how to work around the gotchas,
</I>&gt;<i> then they can do it with relative ease.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;- it's an amalgam of tools, which constantly update. There was never an
</I>&gt;<i> easy way to duplicate a working setup from one machine to the next
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree, but that's an issue with any complex software project with build
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies surely? I work with Yocto Embedded Linux builds and I can tell
</I>&gt;<i> you that it's even more difficult there, but they manage it extremely well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To address this seems to me a matter of understanding/documenting the
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies and, where necessary, defining the require versions of those
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies to ensure a build works in a controlled manner.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am making an assumption that the dependencies are all on Cygwin (are
</I>&gt;<i> there any others?). If so then it should be relatively straightforward to
</I>&gt;<i> define the version of Cygwin to use and/or pull down specific versioned
</I>&gt;<i> packages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It was suggested to me that a setup script that pulled down appropriate
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies would be useful, and I agree. I have been meaning to do
</I>&gt;<i> something on that as I think it is straightforward but haven't yet had the
</I>&gt;<i> time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If this was to be in place do you think there would be any other toolchain
</I>&gt;<i> issues that would need consideration?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;This was done with cygwin and was packaged by an additional installer
</I>&gt;<i> step. The installer step was never very transparent so I can't comment on
</I>&gt;<i> that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Somebody somewhere must have been building the Windows installer, at least
</I>&gt;<i> up until 3.2.3. I believe it would be helpful if somebody could take time
</I>&gt;<i> to explain how this works or just provide the automation to build the
</I>&gt;<i> installer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When we execute the 'make install' step what results on Windows is missing
</I>&gt;<i> key files such as 'mono.exe' and instead has Linux stubs such as 'mono'
</I>&gt;<i> which causes problems. I would like to understand how the install
</I>&gt;<i> step is supposed to work and to try to fix it instead of having to
</I>&gt;<i> manually fix it up each time. Similarly I would like to be able to generate
</I>&gt;<i> a non-official installer in the same way as the official installer is
</I>&gt;<i> built, which at least
</I>&gt;<i> people could then use in the absence of an official installer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; given the size and complexity of the mono build and tests, it was
</I>&gt;<i> generally not robust. Especially for continuous and automated usage
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My experience is that once the issues with any given release are addressed
</I>&gt;<i> then it builds reliably. Master is of course a different beast but I am not
</I>&gt;<i> looking at supporting a build from an arbitrary commit here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;- it was slow. Slow as in hours on Windows vs minutes on Linux
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, my guess is that it's perhaps related to forking on Windows under
</I>&gt;<i> Cygwin but who knows.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be nice to have a faster build but, for example, building a Yocto
</I>&gt;<i> image can take many, many hours. (And don't get me started on WindowsCE...)
</I>&gt;<i> I think people can live with this if it actually builds for them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  To me a first pass at needed actions are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - define one or more supported Windows build host platforms.
</I>&gt;<i> - take the latest Mono 3.10.0 release and create an installer script for
</I>&gt;<i> versioned build dependencies
</I>&gt;<i> - create a simple build script and test script
</I>&gt;<i> - understand how the packaging step works and automate this
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - fix issues with installation of Mono files that aren't currently correct
</I>&gt;<i> under Windows (e.g. mono 3.8.0 mono.exe, perhaps fixed in 3.10.0)
</I>&gt;<i> - fix issues with needing to change Cygwin headers for the compile to work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - setup a CI system building and reporting for master.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ideally, as I've said earlier, there would be some buy-in from whomever
</I>&gt;<i> makes decisions on making a release, that before that release it made it
</I>&gt;<i> should at least build cleanly on Windows.

</I>&gt;<i>  Developing on Windows
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  As for actually developing mono on Windows, the main issue was that you
</I>&gt;<i> could not easily use Visual Studio to develop mono. The VS support for the
</I>&gt;<i> runtime was put together long ago as a way to develop/debug, but it still
</I>&gt;<i> required the full cygwin build to configure everything, build the class
</I>&gt;<i> libraries, and run the tests. Even if one was brave enough to work in this
</I>&gt;<i> setup, iteration time was slow (see above). Miguel and others made efforts
</I>&gt;<i> to build everything using MSBuild but nothing quite materialized for a
</I>&gt;<i> variety of reasons.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  All that to say, if you just want to get the Windows support back to
</I>&gt;<i> where it was a few years ago via cygwin it can probably be done in a few
</I>&gt;<i> developer weeks. If you actually want to improve the Windows development
</I>&gt;<i> story, allowing for actual development and usage of Windows tools like
</I>&gt;<i> Visual Studio it's much more work. I'd love for the latter to happen, but
</I>&gt;<i> it's would take a lot of effort and coordination. Effort like improving
</I>&gt;<i> xbuild where needed if msbuild is the build mechanism of choice.
</I>&gt;<i> Coordination like making sure any work done didn't harm other platforms.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fwiw - and this is merely a view from a bystander - I don't think it

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mono does build on Windows, but it doesn't &quot;just work&quot; as people tend to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expect nowadays. It needs some stream-lining imho with some setup script
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> automation or similar for newbies. There are also some missing links in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> how an official Windows release is created versus using make, as we end
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up with missing files on install (or I am misunderstanding  something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that needs doing, which in itself would be a documentation issue).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To me this isn't a code issue so much as an ownership and release
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> management issue. I recognise there is a cost to that and there has to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be an ROI for that cost to be worth bearing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Releases are made with broken Window builds as Vincent says. So imho
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it's a dead work &quot;fixing&quot; master at any given time as it will just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> become broken again, although some basic setup scripting to pull down
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cygwin, dependencies, to get the installation step working and such
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would help people to get going, I feel.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What's more relevant, I believe, is a maintainer who has committed to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Windows build testing and patching prior to an  offical release of Mono,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a buy-in from other release maintainers that this is worth doing (or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what's the point?), and perhaps some CI running the Mono tests in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> background.
