<PRE>Hi Jonathan,

Thanks for taking the time to provide the background.

I understand/agree that facilitating development on Windows is a complex
task. I've seen some of the emails over time and can well imagine it's
complex and invasive to the existing build system. People start the
work, but I''ve not seen anything come out of it.

If I take my scope as something much simpler, which is just to
facilitate building Mono on Windows from scratch, on a vanilla Windows
platform, perhaps defined as Windows 7/8.1 x32/x64 or whatever, then I
think that's much more achievable.

I have been looking at this since 3.4.0 and the main issues I have
encountered were having the right dependencies, idiosyncracies of the
build tools, and issues with releases such as missing files/problems
with Cygwin headers.

Perhaps very few of us are fit for purpose when it comes to actually
_contributing_ to Mono, but I can well understand that the first step an
OpenSource developer wants to make is to compile a project from source
and run up the results.

I can also understand the frustration when you've spent a couple of days
on this and just keep encountering problems. People can then give up in
frustration.

Even the longest journey begins with a single step and it strikes me
that it would be a useful thing to facilitate newbies building on
Windows to get them going on that journey, even if that's just by
documenting issues they will encounter.

The emails I get from individuals show me that when they do have the
information they need to build Mono, and how to work around the gotchas,
then they can do it with relative ease.

&gt;<i>- it's an amalgam of tools, which constantly update. There was never an
</I>easy way to duplicate a working setup from one machine to the next

I agree, but that's an issue with any complex software project with
build dependencies surely? I work with Yocto Embedded Linux builds and I
can tell you that it's even more difficult there, but they manage it
extremely well.

To address this seems to me a matter of understanding/documenting the
dependencies and, where necessary, defining the require versions of
those dependencies to ensure a build works in a controlled manner.

I am making an assumption that the dependencies are all on Cygwin (are
there any others?). If so then it should be relatively straightforward
to define the version of Cygwin to use and/or pull down specific
versioned packages.

It was suggested to me that a setup script that pulled down appropriate
dependencies would be useful, and I agree. I have been meaning to do
something on that as I think it is straightforward but haven't yet had
the time.

If this was to be in place do you think there would be any other
toolchain issues that would need consideration?

&gt;<i>This was done with cygwin and was packaged by an additional installer
</I>step. The installer step was never very transparent so I can't comment
on that.

Somebody somewhere must have been building the Windows installer, at
least up until 3.2.3. I believe it would be helpful if somebody could
take time to explain how this works or just provide the automation to
build the installer.

When we execute the 'make install' step what results on Windows is
missing key files such as 'mono.exe' and instead has Linux stubs such as
'mono' which causes problems. I would like to understand how the install
step is supposed to work and to try to fix it instead of having to
manually fix it up each time. Similarly I would like to be able to
generate a non-official installer in the same way as the official
installer is built, which at least
people could then use in the absence of an official installer.

&gt;<i> given the size and complexity of the mono build and tests, it was
</I>generally not robust. Especially for continuous and automated usage

My experience is that once the issues with any given release are
addressed then it builds reliably. Master is of course a different beast
but I am not looking at supporting a build from an arbitrary commit here.

&gt;<i>- it was slow. Slow as in hours on Windows vs minutes on Linux
</I>
Yes, my guess is that it's perhaps related to forking on Windows under
Cygwin but who knows.

It would be nice to have a faster build but, for example, building a
Yocto image can take many, many hours. (And don't get me started on
WindowsCE...) I think people can live with this if it actually builds
for them.

To me a first pass at needed actions are:

- define one or more supported Windows build host platforms.
- take the latest Mono 3.10.0 release and create an installer script for
versioned build dependencies
- create a simple build script and test script
- understand how the packaging step works and automate this

- fix issues with installation of Mono files that aren't currently
correct under Windows (e.g. mono 3.8.0 mono.exe, perhaps fixed in 3.10.0) 
- fix issues with needing to change Cygwin headers for the compile to work.

- setup a CI system building and reporting for master.

Ideally, as I've said earlier, there would be some buy-in from whomever
makes decisions on making a release, that before that release it made it
should at least build cleanly on Windows.

Cheers,

Alex

</I>&gt;<i>     management issue. I recognise there is a cost to that and there has to
</I>&gt;<i>     be an ROI for that cost to be worth bearing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Releases are made with broken Window builds as Vincent says. So imho

</I>&gt;<i>     become broken again, although some basic setup scripting to pull down
</I>&gt;<i>     Cygwin, dependencies, to get the installation step working and such
</I>&gt;<i>     would help people to get going, I feel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     What's more relevant, I believe, is a maintainer who has committed to
</I>&gt;<i>     Windows build testing and patching prior to an  offical release of
</I>&gt;<i>     Mono,
</I>&gt;<i>     a buy-in from other release maintainers that this is worth doing (or
</I>&gt;<i>     what's the point?), and perhaps some CI running the Mono tests in the
