Please do not intermix the expectations/entitlements you've got for
being a paying customer of Xamarin with their Open Source efforts.

As long as the community isn't moving (or even fork, as a last resort)
things won't change substantially. Miguel has clearly stated
multiple times that there is enough room for involvement in some
areas (e.g. Server Stack), even commercially. I haven't seen anyone
stepping up so far, at least not here.

A few pull requests are not enough to show commitment and to take
ownership over a module/subsystem/whatever. Hackers are coming
and going, code is rotting away, Xamarin is collecting the garbage.
I guess they are tired of this ;)

On pull request discussions on this list: Assuming that core
devs are rather monitoring this list (I hope it's still the case),
I'd prefer this approach anytime to the discussion over at GitHub.
I've given up on reviewing because of this `media switch'.

Robert
