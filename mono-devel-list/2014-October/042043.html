</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, but that's the point - Why would you want to use Mono on windows?  The only reasons I know of are (a) you wish to debug the mono sources using Visual Studio, or (b) you wish to use one of Mono's assemblies in windows, such as Mono.Security, Mono.Data.Sqlite, etc.

I guess different people will have different use-cases but this is ours
(which I don't think is so unique)

We develop software targetting Embedded Linux, Windows desktop/server
and Windows CE/Embedded Compact with .NET CF.

We use Visual Studio (plus Resharper as Bryan so rightly says - couldn't
get along without it) as we find this to be a productive development
environment.
In addition there is a lot of development resource out there with people
who know and are qualified on the VS toolchain.

Ideally we'd be write once and it'd just work whatever the platform or
framework, but the reality is we run into platform dependencies (SQLite
as you say, serial comms in the past), native dependencies and
configuration issues.

&gt;<i>From a productivity perspective and for risk management for testing and
</I>deployment I wish to be able to develop and debug under Visual Studio
with Mono as a framework option.

I'd like to be able to do that with Mono on Windows as a check that no
issues come up between running on the .NET framework and running on Mono.

In addition I'd like to be able to remote debug to Embedded Linux with
Visual Studio - which  I used to be able to do with Xamarin's Monotools
Server before it disappeared.

I'm currently investigating a VS plugin to replace Monotools Server
which I've not had much luck with yet, but I'm optimistic:
