<PRE>Hi Miguel,

That is a great idea around making them synchronous in the background.  I'm
sure this would cause some issues for people, however if we can hit the
main use cases in the initial stab that would be great.

Are you suggesting that this is done in the Webapi code, or somewhere in
the mono source.  My goal has been to make it so we don't need our own
implementation of the aspnetwebstack.  It would also be great if we can say
that async controllers work in mono, just run synchronously, rather than
&quot;use these dlls and Webapi will work&quot;.

Thanks for offering to help out, if there is some initial Google terms you
could point me in the direction of that would be great as Async pipeline
doesn't seem to be specific enough.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi all,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm still working through implementing methods to mvc/webapi, however,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now, my perception is that this means that the note on the mono

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If I take this on, I'm going to need some help to implement it.  I see 2

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be implemented in the current codebase for other things, etc.  Second, we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enlist the help of someone who is more equipped.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I believe that there are quite a few people who are interested in getting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this implemented, and therefore I have an idea that we could potentially
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crowd fund the money to pay a contractor to potentially do it.  My hope
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be that with a financial incentive, someone within Xamarin may be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> willing to put forward their spare time to do it.  This would likely give
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> us a better chance of getting it merged due to them already being used
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Miguel's (understandably high) standards and the processes involved in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contributing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, is there anybody else who would be willing to donate to this (I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thinking something like a kickstarter campaign so that people can get their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> money back if it doesn't go ahead).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, does anyone who has an idea of how it would be done have any idea
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what sort of effort we would be looking at?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Alternatively, can someone give me an idea of where to start with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementing it?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks,
