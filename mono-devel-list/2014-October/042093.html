<PRE>Hi All,

This is probably more a question for Miguel, but I thought I'd make it
public.

I'm looking through the list of PR's (103 at the moment) and I thought it
best to go from the end.  However, it seems like most of these are either
done by someone who no longer has interest in contributing, or probably no
longer relevant.

I'm wondering whether the best option here is to try and put a bit of a
hardline policy for a short time to get the list to a more manageable
number, and make sure that PR's will be responded to and updated by the
commiter.

What I'm thinking is, ping the commiter, give them 1 week to respond (in
some way, not necessarily update it, just acknowledge it).  After that
simply close it.

The goal here is that if the list is smaller, so the contributors actually
feel that clearing the queue is an achievable task.

For this to work, I'm thinking we (I'm happy to dedicate some time to this)
could just ping the mailing list to ask you close them Miguel?  I'm
thinking it's an easy and quick thing to do, so we can expect a fairly
quick turnaround?

Any thoughts welcome.

Thanks,
Martin
