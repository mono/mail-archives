<PRE>Let me add a couple of points.

First, I have noticed is that:

   - Contributors do not make a habit out of checking pull requests;   I
   know I don't

   - GitHub is too chatty, so everyone I know just filters notifications.
   I suspect this is why anyone being assigned issues just ignores them.
   There is just too much traffic.

Mono historically took patches from the mailing list.   Not from github
pull requests.   So culturally, this was never aligned, it just kind of
happened, and we kind of never evolved or changed with it.

Perhaps what we need is for these pull requests to be posted here on the
list and discussed here on the list.

I think this is better, as we have a place where the larger community can
comment on patches.   It would surface the discussion to everyone, as
opposed to limiting it to those that happen to stumble on the pull requests
or visit the page.

Second, I think there is a room for folks to contribute to this process,
even if they are not committers, or active contributors.  Someone that
could shepherd a contributor and the contribution.   Many of the patches do
not meet the basic requirements for a patch review, and we end up wasting
valuable time on them.

Things that we would need:

   - An actual detailed explanation of the change.   Many patches are
   submitted with very little information.

   - Test cases: many patches are contributed without tests to show the
   problem as it is today nor to ensure that the code does not regress.

   - Style: many patches contain white space changes, unnecessary
   refactoring and changes that are not suitable to be contributed.

   - Rebasing: many patches are contributed and fixes are piled on top of
   each other.   The result is not suitable to be merged as it would
   essentially pollute the commit history.   So someone that can assist the
   less sophisticated among us to &quot;squash&quot; the commits would help.

   - Patches that change the surface and contain no documentation.

   - Steering developers to discuss the patches on the mailing list and
   following up directly on the mailing list with the reviewers to ensure that
   the patches can be merged.

I think the above would help us tremendously to accelerate the patch review
process.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This seems to be a chicken-and-egg problem. We need to christen more

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I got really excited about contributing to Mono about two years ago; I

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> help demonstrate that Mono could be a viable alternative for non-Windows
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> development. But research into the state of the community left me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disappointed: PRs are ignored, roadmaps are horribly out of date, builds
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are constantly broken...in general, not an environment that encourages
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> community members to contribute their valuable time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I understand the desire to maintain a high standard for contributed code,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and I support maintaining that standard; but a process MUST be developed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that encourages community contribution rather than stagnating it.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hello Greg,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The best approach is to stay engaged in the pull requests and bring the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> attention to the mailing list for us to discuss.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Long term, the ideal situation is one where we can give more people

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The bar for mono is high: we can not just take any code and distribute
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it, since the impact of mistakes is large.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> To give an example, even new Xamarin employees that are hired to work
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> exclusively on the runtime are working through pull requests, and they also
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> have to wait for some of the more senior people to review and approve the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> patches.   We have very nice fixes that we still postpone until we have the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> bandwidth of doing a full review.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In the meantime, if you need quick hacks, you can always fork Mono and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> distribute your forked version with your changes.
