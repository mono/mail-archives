I've build this again under Cygwin with mono-3.10.0-branch
autoconf/configure/make/make install

I was wrong about the source tree. There is a mono.exe in mono/mini.
However this is a symlink to mono-sgen.exe
which seems to be a build output from the timestamp.

I suspect this is related to symlinking issues with Cygwin and with the
Mono build as the make install step creates
a &quot;mono&quot; file in the installation bin directory, rather than the needed
&quot;mono.exe&quot;.

My reading seems to indicate that unless configured otherwise Cygwin
creates &quot;magic cookie&quot; shortcuts for
symlinks so it might be that the install process is causing Cygwin to
create that shortcut as &quot;mono&quot; rather than
&quot;mono.exe&quot; and that what we really need is either to configure Cygwin to
generate hard links instead of magic
cookies or perhaps preferably just to copy mono-sgen.exe as mono.exe

There's also a similar thing going on with mcs I think

Cheers,

Alex
