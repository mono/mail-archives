fwiw Mono's great etc. etc. and I would love to be able to run Mono on
Arm hardfp platforms so was really pleased and grateful for the work
that went in to support this around 3.2.7

Unfortunately there were issues, most obviously with an exception trying
to show a textbox.

So I read up on how to file a bug report
(<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/community/bugs/make-a-good-bug-report/">http://www.mono-project.com/community/bugs/make-a-good-bug-report/</A>) and
did so, with a test case that shows the problem in a straightforward manner.

The bug report was filed in May and is here:
<A HREF="https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=20239">https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=20239</A>

So, I don't know, maybe I went about this wrongly, but I tried to follow
the procedures laid down for raising this as I understood it.

I also made it clear that I was happy to put some time on and work on
this but could do with some support to get going, so I'm not trying to
freload on others doing the work here.

Yet there was absolutely no response at all. Not &quot;redo the report for
this reason&quot;, &quot;you need to look here&quot;, &quot;we're looking at this&quot; or even
&quot;we have no intention of fixing this&quot;.

It's really discouraging when you put in the time and try to follow the
procedures laid down but there is absolutely no engagement. I mean - why
bother again if there's no point?

(NB. This issue may or may not be resolved in 3.10.0 but as there was no
response to the bug I have no way of knowing until I have the time to
rebuild and retest on this platform)

Cheers, Alex
