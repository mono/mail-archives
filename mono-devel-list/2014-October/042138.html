<PRE>Hi all,

I'm still working through implementing methods to mvc/webapi, however, I've
found that the newer versions of WebApi are reliant on async controllers.

Now, my perception is that this means that the note on the mono
compatibility page around the Async Pipeline needs to be implemented for
that to work.  First, please let me know if I've misunderstood.

If I take this on, I'm going to need some help to implement it.  I see 2
options, first, someone helps me out with some resources that I can use to
devise a way to do it, articles on the process, examples of where it might
be implemented in the current codebase for other things, etc.  Second, we
enlist the help of someone who is more equipped.

I believe that there are quite a few people who are interested in getting
this implemented, and therefore I have an idea that we could potentially
crowd fund the money to pay a contractor to potentially do it.  My hope
would be that with a financial incentive, someone within Xamarin may be
willing to put forward their spare time to do it.  This would likely give
us a better chance of getting it merged due to them already being used
Miguel's (understandably high) standards and the processes involved in
contributing.

So, is there anybody else who would be willing to donate to this (I'm
thinking something like a kickstarter campaign so that people can get their
money back if it doesn't go ahead).

Also, does anyone who has an idea of how it would be done have any idea
what sort of effort we would be looking at?

Alternatively, can someone give me an idea of where to start with
implementing it?

Thanks,
Martin
