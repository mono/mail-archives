<PRE>Hi all,

Just wanted to give a quick update on where I'm at with getting things
implemented for the aspnetwebstack to work on mono.

As I've said before, my goal is to make it so that the aspnetwebstack
solution will compile against mono, without tweaking anything (this is
stage 1).  It's proving to both a relatively small task, but also very
taxing in terms of me having to learn quite a lot.

*Note: I'm not looking at the tests in aspnetwebstack at the moment, that
will be stage 2, a lot seem to require things we don't have yet.*

In summary, it's not that far off, and once it's done, at least we'll be
able to see which methods may need bugfixing as the webstack will load at
least.  The main issue is getting the PRs approved, but my hope is that if
we can collate a list of the all, we can ask that they are reviewed
together and considering they will make one of the most up and coming web
technologies work on mono, I would say there is a good reason to try and
prioritise it.

Here are the current PR's, I've reviewed the ones that aren't mine and they
now look ok, we just need a contributor to review/merge them.

PR874 - from Chris Carroll with a few properties implemented around routes
PR1163 - from AerisG222 which includes a few changes around Unvalidated
parameters and some other bits
PR1349 - From me regarding MachineKey.Protect methods
PR1353 - From me regarding ReadEntityBodyMode (doesn't actually work, just
the interface)
PR1354 - From me regarding Request.Abort

Outstanding items that I could do with help with:


   1. ReadEntityBodyMode needs properly implementing
   2. Request.GetBufferedInputStream needs implementing.
   Request.GetBufferlessInputStream needs implementing (looks like it's
   already partially implemented).
   3. HttpResponseBase.SuppressFormsAuthenticationRedirect needs
   implementing
   4. HttpTaskAsyncHandler needs implementing.
   5. HttpResponse.ClientDisconnectedToken needs implementing (can just
   return CancellationToken.None and it should be fine but a proper
   implementation would be better).
   6. Do something about System.Data.EntityState, it's supposed to live in
   System.Data.Entity.dll which we don't have but MVC checks against.
   7. Do something about System.Web.UI.DataVisualization.Charting, I don't
   want to have to change the aspnetwebstack code to exclude it, so maybe just
   stub it all out?


I'm planning on doing the HttpTaskAyncHandler next which will probably take
me a couple of evenings this week.  However, if someone thinks that they
could do it without extensive learning (which is what I'm going to need to
do), then by all means take that on and I'll do some of the others.

I'll let you all know when I get further.
Martin
