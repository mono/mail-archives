<PRE>That's great,  there's only a few bits that need doing to make it compile,
and I'm pretty sure I can handle those.

I've put in some crude implementations of the missing elements to try and
scope the work involved, and unless there's something wrong in those, it
needs some further work under the hood.

The issue I see us that I'm getting never ending calls to Webapi endpoints,
whereas standard (non-async) MVC controllers work fine.

So my perception is that there is something stopping the pipeline from
completing.

I think the best option is to complete the missing elements that I believe
I can do, then possibly post a simple Webapi solution that reproduces it.
Then maybe you could use some of your (obviously large amount of) free time
to have a quick look.  Unless there is something off the top of your head
that you think I could look at?

On a side note, do you think you'll be going to Future Decoded on the 12th?
There's a possibility I might be going and it would be nice to put a face
to the name.

Thanks
Martin
Hey,

The changes should be done in Mono.   Just enough to have aspnetwebstack
compile out of the box.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm still working through implementing methods to mvc/webapi, however,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I've found that the newer versions of WebApi are reliant on async

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Now, my perception is that this means that the note on the mono
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> compatibility page around the Async Pipeline needs to be implemented for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that to work.  First, please let me know if I've misunderstood.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If I take this on, I'm going to need some help to implement it.  I see 2
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> options, first, someone helps me out with some resources that I can use to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> devise a way to do it, articles on the process, examples of where it might
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be implemented in the current codebase for other things, etc.  Second, we
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> enlist the help of someone who is more equipped.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I believe that there are quite a few people who are interested in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> getting this implemented, and therefore I have an idea that we could
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> potentially crowd fund the money to pay a contractor to potentially do it.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> My hope would be that with a financial incentive, someone within Xamarin
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> may be willing to put forward their spare time to do it.  This would likely
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> give us a better chance of getting it merged due to them already being used
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Miguel's (understandably high) standards and the processes involved in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> contributing.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So, is there anybody else who would be willing to donate to this (I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> thinking something like a kickstarter campaign so that people can get their
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> money back if it doesn't go ahead).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Also, does anyone who has an idea of how it would be done have any idea
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> what sort of effort we would be looking at?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Alternatively, can someone give me an idea of where to start with
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> implementing it?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks,
