<PRE>&quot;Long term, the ideal situation is one where we can give more people commit
rights, and review rights.   But until we have developed the skills in the
community that are needed, we will continue with the current setup.&quot;

This seems to be a chicken-and-egg problem. We need to christen more
reviewers in order to handle the volume of PRs and keep the Mono community
engaged; but in order to gain enough confidence in a contributor to make
them a reviewer, their requests need to be reviewed! How can we &quot;develop
the skills in the community&quot; if requests routinely sit idle for over a year?

I got really excited about contributing to Mono about two years ago; I love
.NET and C#, but many of my colleagues (not to mention many of the
companies for which we consult) are staunchly anti-Windows; I wanted to
help demonstrate that Mono could be a viable alternative for non-Windows
development. But research into the state of the community left me
disappointed: PRs are ignored, roadmaps are horribly out of date, builds
are constantly broken...in general, not an environment that encourages
community members to contribute their valuable time.

I understand the desire to maintain a high standard for contributed code,
and I support maintaining that standard; but a process MUST be developed
that encourages community contribution rather than stagnating it.

&gt;<i> Hello Greg,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the meantime, if you need quick hacks, you can always fork Mono and
