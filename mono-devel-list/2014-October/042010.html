<PRE>Hi all,

I'm going to try and dedicate a bit of time to the project over the next
couple of months and need a little help understanding where to start with
something specific.

I've been trying make an application mono compliant but came across a bug
in that web Api 5.2.2 isn't compatible with mono.  I've seen a bug in the
xamarin tracker around it, and Miguel has commented that it won't be
compatible until we update mono's version of the aspnetwebstack.

Therefore, I'd like to look at that and try to fix anything that's needed
as I go.

I've got no experience of using submodules in git, so any help on steps to
pull in the latest code and build/test would be beneficial.  I've had a
look at the guide on the mono site and it doesn't really make sense to me.

Further, I don't want to do this work if there is no chance of it being
accepted.  The change will be large I assume, and I know there is a problem
with getting large Pr's accepted.  If I was doing this for myself, I would
simply amend the product I'm trying to get working, so I want to make sure
it's not going to be in vain.

Also, has anyone looked into this in the past and knows of a reason why it
won't work?

Thanks
Martin
