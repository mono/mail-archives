<PRE>Some news.

I created a small test-case that submit a request every time bigger and 
I've been able to reproduce the problem.
The strange thing is that the more logs I add the more loops are 
performed without errors.
It makes me think that is something related to the data sent from apache 
to the input stream and that in some way are lost or not read correctly.
Looking at the request processing I can see that the previous working 
requests works like that (this is mod_mono log):

*****************************************
Command received: GET_CLIENT_BLOCK (7)
*****************************************
requested size == 32768, actual size == 32768
received from apache == 2520
received from apache LE == 2520

write string 2520
status 2520
*****************************************

*****************************************

.... and so on until ....

*****************************************

*****************************************

Usually xsp reads from mod_mono the same value that mod_mono reads from 
apache and everything works. When the request fails I see:

Command received: GET_CLIENT_BLOCK (7)
*****************************************
requested size == 32768, actual size == 32768
received from apache == 32768
received from apache LE == 32768

*****************************************

*****************************************

write size 8277 - 4
status 4
received from apache 2 == 8277
write string 8277
status 8277
*****************************************
Command received: SET_STATUS (8)
Command received: SET_RESPONSE_HEADERS (2)

Command received: SEND_FROM_MEMORY (0)

It seems ok but when mod_mono read 8277 bytes from apache xsp reads a 
value of 1465542519 and it throws the Houston error.
There's someone that understand these kind of things that can drive me 
to the correct road to find the solution?
Thanks in advance.
