<PRE>Hi,

There seem to be a large number of warnings generated during the
Windows/Cygwin build relating to the type of arguments provided to
various support functions.

The functions seem to be mostly prototyped in platform includes such as

/usr/i686-pc-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/include/winbase.h
/usr/i686-pc-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/include/winsock2.h

The warnings are of this flavour

/usr/i686-pc-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/include/winbase.h:1796:24: note:
expected 'PDWORD' but argument is of type 'guint32 *'

I have been experimenting with declaring some of the prototypes within
the build environment instead of in those platform incldues but there's
so much of this I am at a bit of a loss as to how to proceed.

I am now wondering if it is better to pull in winbase.h / winsock2.h and
rewrite them to take the gint* style. I'm not terribly keen on that idea.

That or maybe there's a way to make gint32 and friends appear as LONG
and the equivalents and so forth, although that also seems less than ideal.

Can anybody advise on a sensible way for me to approach this?

Thanks,

Alex
