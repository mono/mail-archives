<PRE>Hi Daniel,

I'm referring to all the work coming out of the aspnetwebstack repository
on codeplex.  I don't think MVC 6 is being developed there yet.

Currently that cover MVC and Webapi that I know of, but there could be
others.  It essentially the codebase used to create the nuget packages.

I actually hit a little snag last night in that after stubbing
everythingthat shouldn't be relevant, I've got to a point where all
typeload exceptions are gone in WebAPI.  However, all Webapi requests just
result in an endless request to the server.  So this may be a fruitless
journey.  On the plus side, MVC 5.2.2 works out of the box it seems.

Thanks,
Martin

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Just wanted to give a quick update on where I'm at with getting things
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implemented for the aspnetwebstack to work on mono.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As I've said before, my goal is to make it so that the aspnetwebstack
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solution will compile against mono, without tweaking anything (this is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stage 1).  It's proving to both a relatively small task, but also very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> taxing in terms of me having to learn quite a lot.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Note: I'm not looking at the tests in aspnetwebstack at the moment, that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be stage 2, a lot seem to require things we don't have yet.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In summary, it's not that far off, and once it's done, at least we'll be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> able to see which methods may need bugfixing as the webstack will load at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> least.  The main issue is getting the PRs approved, but my hope is that if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we can collate a list of the all, we can ask that they are reviewed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> together and considering they will make one of the most up and coming web
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technologies work on mono, I would say there is a good reason to try and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prioritise it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here are the current PR's, I've reviewed the ones that aren't mine and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they now look ok, we just need a contributor to review/merge them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PR874 - from Chris Carroll with a few properties implemented around routes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PR1163 - from AerisG222 which includes a few changes around Unvalidated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parameters and some other bits
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PR1349 - From me regarding MachineKey.Protect methods
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PR1353 - From me regarding ReadEntityBodyMode (doesn't actually work,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just the interface)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PR1354 - From me regarding Request.Abort
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Outstanding items that I could do with help with:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    1. ReadEntityBodyMode needs properly implementing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    2. Request.GetBufferedInputStream needs implementing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Request.GetBufferlessInputStream needs implementing (looks like it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    already partially implemented).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    3. HttpResponseBase.SuppressFormsAuthenticationRedirect needs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    implementing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    4. HttpTaskAsyncHandler needs implementing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    5. HttpResponse.ClientDisconnectedToken needs implementing (can just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    return CancellationToken.None and it should be fine but a proper
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    implementation would be better).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    6. Do something about System.Data.EntityState, it's supposed to live
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    in System.Data.Entity.dll which we don't have but MVC checks against.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    7. Do something about System.Web.UI.DataVisualization.Charting, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    don't want to have to change the aspnetwebstack code to exclude it, so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    maybe just stub it all out?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm planning on doing the HttpTaskAyncHandler next which will probably
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> take me a couple of evenings this week.  However, if someone thinks that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they could do it without extensive learning (which is what I'm going to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need to do), then by all means take that on and I'll do some of the others.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'll let you all know when I get further.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Martin
