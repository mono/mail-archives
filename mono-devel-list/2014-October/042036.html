</I>
Many venture into the waters of mono build on windows.  Few live to tell the tale....    ;-)

The honest truth is, many of us have sunk hours or days into trying to get it to work.  Many of us (including me) strike out and eventually give up.  Occasionally, people come to this mailing list and post a procedure that worked for them.  I've never seen the same procedure twice, I always try, and it's never worked for me.

Your best bet is to search this mailing list archive for the most recent posts of people succeeding, and see if that's able to help you along.

Your *other* best bet, is to ask yourself &quot;Why, God, Why?&quot;  As I have done, and others like me who were also lost in the battle.  Generally speaking, the only reasons to build on windows are because you want to debug the code, which is generally better done on mac/linux.  Or you're trying to accomplish something else, like obtain a specific DLL (such as Mono.Data.Sqlite)...  Which usually you can obtain some other way such as building on linux and then copying the DLL over to windows.

So if you don't succeed at building on windows, then ask yourself (and this list) if there's another way to accomplish whatever you're actually trying to accomplish.
