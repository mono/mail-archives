<PRE>Hey Miguel,
 
sorry if that wasn't clear, I of course used a tool (<A HREF="https://github.com/fanf2/unifdef">https://github.com/fanf2/unifdef</A>) to remove the ifdefs, doing that by hand would be little crazy :)
I also rebuilt and compared the assemblies to make sure nothing has changed.

Hey Alex,
It is very repetitive work, so what I wanted to do was to write a perl script to remove the *obvious* ifdefs.   The tool would remove only those that match the following criteria (more or less):
Remove toplevel #if NET_2_0 with the final #endifOnly remove those that contain those preprocessor directivesAnd then have a human do the more fine-tuned approach.      There are a couple more defines that I remember could be automated, but I would love to have this in the form of a script.
I am afraid of applying a patch like that blindly, because there are no exact guarantees of what happened without reviewing the whole file.  So a script with the invariants would take a lot of my nervousness out.
Also, when I did it once, I had a setup where I rebuilt the assemblies and compared the output.  This would ensure that removal of ifdefs did not change the resulting binaries.

Sounds like a good thing ;-)



I've got a branch in my fork where I removed the NET_2_0 ifdefs:

<A HREF="https://github.com/akoeplinger/mono/compare/remove-net20-ifdefs,">https://github.com/akoeplinger/mono/compare/remove-net20-ifdefs,</A> @kumpera

told me a while ago that removing the 2.0 profile is on the horizon when I

asked about why the ifdefs are still there.



I refrained from making a PR so far because it is quite huge, do you think

now would be a good time?
