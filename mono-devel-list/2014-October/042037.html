Generally speaking, the only reasons to build on windows are because you want to debug the code, which is generally better done on mac/linux.  Or you're trying to accomplish something else, like obtain a specific DLL (such as Mono.Data.Sqlite)...  Which usually you can obtain some other way such as building on linux and then copying the DLL over to windows.

Ed,

Agreed, but the the other reason is that you want to use a current Mono
yet nobody has gotten around to an official release of Mono for WIndows
since 3.2.3.

Cheers,

Alex
