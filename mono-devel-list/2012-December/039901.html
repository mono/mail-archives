&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> it is rather known fact that adding a finalizer to the class can hurt
</I>&gt;<i> performance quite badly with generational garbage collectors. This is
</I>&gt;<i> due to the premortem finalization used by CLR. If an object is not
</I>&gt;<i> reachable during GC, but has a finalizer, it will survive and probably
</I>&gt;<i> be promoted to the next generation. Not so bad in its essence, but such
</I>&gt;<i> object will transitively make all referenced objects alive and these
</I>&gt;<i> will be promoted as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Consider simple benchmark contained in the attached file Test705.cs. The
</I>&gt;<i> intstances of classes are being born and dying, also they have reference
</I>&gt;<i> to the table of objects. The class A has an finalizer. On my computer
</I>&gt;<i> (SGEN, Mono 2.10.8) the result is:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Took 00:00:32.4182579
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you comment out the finalizer, the result is:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Took 00:00:04.2515352
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So the difference is significant.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Most of the time (at least from my experience) developers do not need
</I>&gt;<i> premortem finalization. That is, they do not need to have the reference
</I>&gt;<i> to the instance that is being finalized. What they need is some kind of
</I>&gt;<i> simple callback called after this instance is GCd (the callback could
</I>&gt;<i> also have some kind of parameter related to such instance). As you can
</I>&gt;<i> see, this is also the case in the mentioned example -- the reference to
</I>&gt;<i> the original instance is not needed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When I encountered internal sgen API for reference queues, I thought
</I>&gt;<i> that this could be used to do postmortem finalization. Unfortunately,
</I>&gt;<i> the API was not stable yet and therefore not public.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But there is another, very simple idea. Instead of having a finalizer in
</I>&gt;<i> A, one could do dummy class B (with its own finalizer) to instance of
</I>&gt;<i> which A would have a reference. Therefore B's finalizer would serve as a
</I>&gt;<i> callback function of A.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The attached example Test706.cs is based on this idea. And the result
</I>&gt;<i> is:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Took 00:00:04.6424758
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So it is in the same order of magnitude.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yup, this is very simple idea, nonetheless works well and did not come
</I>&gt;<i> to me as a solution immediately, so maybe this will be useful to
</I>&gt;<i> someone. Or I am wrong somewhere ;)
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
It may be worth adding, that with the fresh Mono from GIT the results
are similar (although new sgen is faster in general which is a good
news), respectively:

Took 00:00:28.1762050
Took 00:00:03.5601241
Took 00:00:03.9642138
