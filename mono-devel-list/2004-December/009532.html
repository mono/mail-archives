<PRE>Hi!

Thanks for the feedback.

&gt;<i> This IDE looks good.  Any thoughts about visual designers, either for
</I>&gt;<i> ASP.NET or for forms?
</I>
Not for version 1. For the first release we focus on code-centric features.

&gt;<i> What widget set are you using?
</I>
X-develop is written in Java and uses the Swing toolkit. This allowed us
to reuse a considerable amount of tried and tested code from our Java
IDE CodeGuide .

&gt;<i> Are you considering supporting NAnt as a build tool, as well as
</I>&gt;<i> MSBUILD?
</I>
Yes, why not. However that would be an add-on as X-develop uses the
MSBUILD file format for its project files for compatibility with VS.net
2005. As such the developer would have to create NAnt files by hand or
we could autocreate them every once in a while from the *.*proj files in
the solution.

Does the NAnt package include any interoperabiliy tools
(converters/importers) for MSBUILD projects?

&gt;<i> I would also recommend exposing more aspects of your IDE in your
</I>&gt;<i> plug-in API than just language support.  
</I>
This is planned, but we had to start somewhere...

&gt;<i> It'd also might be smart to
</I>&gt;<i> put out an open source &quot;lite&quot; version, and a premium/advanced
</I>&gt;<i> version, a la eclipse &amp; websphere...
</I>
IBM poors metric truckloads of money into Eclipse and it is very hard to 
believe that their WSAD sales cover even a fraction of that cost. I 
doubt that this is going to work for us.


Best regards,


Hans
