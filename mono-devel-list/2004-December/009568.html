<PRE>It is not even necessary to install PostgreSQL on Windows. The reason most
people use Microsoft Access is not the database server capabilities but the
ability to develop easily a rudimentary UI with virtually 0 programming
knowledge or the reporting capabilities. Scalability, reliability, security
are really no concerns for Access users. There is a good news though: Access
is able to use linked tables.
So if in a real life scenario (of which I personally doubt) anyone would
need to use both an Access application and an application running under
mono, the best thing to do would be to develop a scenario in which actual
data is managed by a real database server. A better approach though would be
to simply give up Microsoft Access applications which sooner or later will
lead to huge problems and go for real solutions.

I second that Rafael!  The mono debugger *.mdb files should be renamed to
*.mdbg

PostgreSQL 8.0 is beautiful on Windows.  It is a native Windows application.
The Installer for it will not allow you to install it for a user with
Administrator privileges.  This is a good thing though.  I've been using an
alpha version of it fine for several months now.

Yeah, someone does need to come up with some C# bindings to using MDB Tools.

Forgot to copy the list.

Also it is unfortunate that we choose to use &quot;.mdb&quot; as the extension for our
debug-information files. Any windows developers experimenting Mono (and
worse: the windows shell/explorer) will think they are MS Access database
files.

I recomend that we change the conflicting extension to &quot;.mdbg&quot;

Fun,

Hi Baccarin,

The problem is: there is not a good driver/provider for access in the linux
world. You'll need to use our &quot;OLEDB&quot; provider (that uses gda, if I remember
correctly) or the odbc (the linux kind of odbc) provider, and the MDB Tools
(<A HREF="http://mdbtools.sourceforge.net/">http://mdbtools.sourceforge.net/</A>).

The big problem is MDB Tools just give read access. You can't use it to
update tables in the MS Access .MDB file, so the best thing you can do with
it is to use its tool to extract the schema and data to a real relational
database server (I recommend PostgreSQL).

The cause for all that trouble, as with many other things MS, is that the MS
Access file formats (plural, because they are different from version to
version) are undocumented.

As I said go to something more portable/consistent than MDB files: If you
don't like PostgreSQL (it is still a bit awkward to install/run in
Windows) you may try Firebird, that in Windows can be embedded (as a native
dll) in your application.

Hope it helps a bit,
