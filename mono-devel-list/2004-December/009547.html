So you need 11 bits for the file name. For any file less than 8000
lines, you can give up to 256 cols. The line / col tradeoff could be
done per file: a file with lots of lines won't get column number
information. You could also give fuzzy col numbers (does it matter if it
tells me col `57' or `58'?). This could save some bits.

Another way I can think of to solve the problem: Every 256 lines you
parse, make an entry into a table that looks like this:

checkpoint [i ++] = { &quot;file name&quot;, segment line number }

So, this means every 256 lines you have a `checkpoint', with this
information. You then can encode location to look like:


[ checkpoint (16 bits) ] [ line delta (8 bits) ] [ col num (8 bits)]

`line delta' is how many lines after the checkpoint this location is.
Col number is the column number. To make this encoded location into a
string you say:

filename = checkpoint [loc.checkpoint].filename
line = loc.linedelta + checkpoint [loc.checkpoint].line
col = loc.col

The only problem with this is `what do you do when you run out of
checkpoints?' One idea is that you reserve the upper bit of `checkpoint'
to mean `overflow'. If this bit is set, just encode a file in the first
16 bits and a line number in the second 16 bits, and bail out on col
numbers.

</I>How much does the RSS memory used by `ps' change? That is the number
that really matters.

&gt;<i> 	  So which is the preferable solution, to use long or not?

</I>
You could make properties to get needed information.
