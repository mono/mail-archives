<PRE>Hi,

The idea behind both Mono and .Net is to be multi platform. Since that,
you will be able to write an app using .Net and use it in Mono. However,
there are some special things to be noted:

* Paths are commonly a problem (as far as I know), specially when they
are absolute ones (example &quot;C:\&quot; wouldn't be well handled in Linux). The
relative ones are converted (the \ are converted into /, for example).
Since that, it is important to port the sections where you use that kind
of path, or you can try to manage to avoid this kind of absolute paths
(an idea could be to get the paths from config files, for example).

* Some areas in the API in Mono haven't been implemented, and some
others are being developed. Some of them can't be implemented since
there is no equivalence between Windows and Linux worlds (COM
components, for example). However, most of the classes are working
(compatibility with .Net 1.0 and Mono 1.0; support for newer versions
of .Net is being implemented in current svn repository).

* System.Windows.Forms (the GUI) was an incomplete assembly in Mono 1.0;
however, currently a group of hackers is working on  it, and I have seen
a lot of new developed widgets there (there are alternatives today, like
Gtk#, which is a multiplatform GUI library).

Hope it helps,
Carlos.

&gt;<i> Would it be possible to write an application in C# .NET and later on
</I>&gt;<i> to port, compile or via any other means run it on Linux?
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, is plain MS .NET based C# codebase &quot;compatible&quot; with Mono?
</I>&gt;<i> Will I be able to compile it using Mono?
