Just to sum it up: removing the statement that the links the last BB
in the IL code block to the end BB is ok, because the link should be
created when the BB is generated (as agreed on IRC).

The existing code already handled all the &quot;RET&quot; cases correctly.

This patch adds the link from BBs ending with tail calls or throw
statements to the end BB.

I was a bit unsure about throw/rethrow statements, but looking
at how this method was handled I got convinced:

static int test_0_catch () {
	Exception x = new Exception ();

	try {
		throw x;
	} catch (Exception e) {
	if (e == x)
		return 0;
	}
	return 1;
}

I sow that in the resulting CFG the end BB was *unreachable* from
the entry BB (the BB with the throw had no out BB at all, and this
does not depend from being the &quot;last BB&quot;: it isn't the last one).

With this patch, the BB with the throw gets connected to the end BB.

Of course the patch passes all regression test... In any case, the
tests passed also without the (corrected) patch.
I think that this correction will most likely prevent *future*
problems, when we will apply SSA (at least to some variables) also
in the presence of catch/finally clauses.

OK to commit?

Ciao,
  Massi
