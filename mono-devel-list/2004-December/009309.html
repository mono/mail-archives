I had heard that despite it only changing 10 lines of code, the WINElib
hack neglected certain corner cases and wasn't tested rigorously enough to
make the WINE maintainers happy..

I'd like to see this too, I personally always felt that the WINElib
approach was intuitively a better idea. It would make the drawing API
consistent across platforms, including Windows where it'd simply use the
real thing, and it would innately support all those controls that make
silly assumptions about the underlying system API and event model. :-) I
was disappointed when I first read about the libgc threading problems, and
I'm glad a fix was found for that.
