<PRE>&gt;<i>WINE-controlled threads became apparent. WINElib wasn't even a particularly
</I>&gt;<i>safe hack of WINE, and the WINE maintainers refused to consider adding it
</I>&gt;<i>to the main WINE distribution. It was these difficulties, I believe, that
</I>&gt;<i>caused the WINE-based implementation to be ditched.
</I>
Actually, Paul Davis from linuxaudiosystems built some standalone WINE 
threading fixes on top of my WINElib hack, and I later hacked those fixes 
into WINE and in fact had a multi-threaded SWF app using WINE working.
Considering that WINElib was very unintrusive (and quite safe, only about 10 
lines of code changes to WINE) and yet it got rejected, I did not expect the 
WINE guys to ever accept the threading patches to WINE.

It was a nice proof of concept, and I'm hoping to be able to pick up on it 
after we finish our System.Windows.Forms library, because it would help 
support those applications that still do their own P/Invokes.

Cheers,
  Peter
