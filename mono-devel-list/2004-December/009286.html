<PRE>After enabling 'nobody' to login, I discovered that mono was returning
the following message/url. <A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/issues.html">http://www.go-mono.com/issues.html</A>
After checking out the error message details, I noticed that the
shared files mono uses weren't able to be created because by default
'nobody' has the user home directory set to / because its not normally
allowed to login.  After setting a folder in which it could write to
(/var/www/nobody, since apache uses it) it was able to create the
shared files, and now the program executes normally.  Is this a bug in
mono when it can't create the shared files ~/.wapi to kind of freak
out possibly?
All and all, matter is resolved, thanks for the suggestion!
