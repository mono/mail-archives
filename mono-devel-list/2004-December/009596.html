<PRE>Hi all,

i'm currently trying to port one of our games to MacOSX 10.3.
We are using SDL/OpenGL for graphics rendering. The Mono version is 
1.05. The SDL samples are running flawless. The Windows and Linux ports 
are running fine ( with mono and .NET)
The compile of our game was OK, but when i try to start the programm i 
get the following error:

&lt;snip&gt;

&lt;NSInternalInconsistencyException&gt; Error (1002) creating CGSWindow
Trace/BPT trap
&lt;snip&gt;

Mono was run with the -v parameter. For me it seemed that the native 
call to set the video mode ( SDL_SetVideMode ) failed.
Has everyone had a simliar problem or has a hint for me how to solve 
this problem?

Thanks a lot!

Sven
