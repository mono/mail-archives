<PRE>Hello everyone, I've recently run into a very strange problem.  I have
code snip that I ported from php to C# (using mono).  This code use to
work great, but somewhere through the software upgrades to apache and
mono, something is a miss.  I can write a php script that system(&quot;mono
file.exe&quot;); and run it from the linux shell, and it works perfectly. 
Now if I attempt to access the same file from over apache serving it,
use both 3ghz cpus and lag the box completely to nothing for about
60-120seconds.  The C# code basically opens a tcp connection, sends a
few lines, and reads a response.  In the code its designed to time out
rather quickly if it doesn't receieve data back in a timely manner. 
The only difference between me running it from the console, and from
apache, is when im running from the console, im running it as root, or
another user, but from over apache its being ran as 'nobody'.
Other then that im rather confused to what might be causing the
problem, but I defently can't have the huge resources its using.  Any
help/ideas/suggestion are welcome.  Please help! Many Thanks!

</PRE>
