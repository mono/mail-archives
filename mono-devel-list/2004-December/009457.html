<PRE>    Yo;  Me again, with my annoying newbie (But easy-to-answer!) questions.
I'm making an ASP app in C# that accesses a PostGreSQL database.   I 
keep getting a &quot;The object was used after being disposed&quot; error, 
apparently after I've loaded a page that accesses the database, and then 
load another page that does the same.  After about 30 seconds I can hit 
the refresh button and everything works fine.
    Any tips as to what the problem might be?
          Thanx,
                ES

Give me three reasons to use Microsoft software.  Chances are the only feasable ones are:

I'm ignorant and don't realize that the open-source community has proven that open-source WORKS, I think open-source software is vastly infererior....... I obviously have never used an open-source program developed by a large community.

I like Halo....... okay, good point.  

I like the Visual part of Visual Studio.....  Yes, it can be handy at times.  But an experience .NET developer would have no problem switch to Linux in a jiffy, losing little or no productivity. (www.mono-project.com)
