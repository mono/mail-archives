<PRE>Hi,

I'm about to finish off a compiling mono from scratch on a virgin
machine and it has been suggested by a friend at the ACCU that I also
add in a FAQ for mono.

I can think of a couple of questions, but are there any questions that
seem to crop up time and again where a FAQ may be useful?

Feel free to email to me off-list (or even on list!).

Also, would there be any problems with me registering a domain called
using-mono.org.uk (or something similar) as my contribution to the
bigger picture? (I'm guessing that the suits at Novell may object, even
if Miguel et al is cool with it). 

It would have lots of building instructions, some C# example and
platform specific material as well as current status of the project
overall. Bandwidth depending, a mirror of the svn may even be possible.
All in planning, just depends on if Novell say it's okay. I would want
their blessing before I do anything like that with the name.

TTFN

Paul
