<PRE>Dear Mono list,

We have a .NET project written originally on the PC, using VB.NET. It 
is a Web Service. There's no UI, aside from the web-pages that it 
publishes. The web pages are just the descriptions of the Web Services. 
So, I read about Mono being able to do .NET stuff on UNIX-y platforms, 
including MacOS X, and it sounds incredibly useful.

Anyway, most of my expertise is as a Mac programmer, not as a UNIX guy. 
So my command-line experience is little, and my UNIX background is 
almost nothing. So naturally, when I see installation instructions 
like:

	7.  	Configure GTK# as per the following: 
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/sw/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/X11R6/lib/pkgconfig \ 
PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH \ ./configure 
--prefix=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/1.0

I naturally panic and think, &quot;WTF?&quot;

I'm not sure which parts need downloading, which parts need compiling, 
etc.

So my question is, has someone written the &quot;Installing and developing 
Mono on MacOS X for Dummies&quot; yet? The instructions on the Go-Mono site 
seem to be written by someone more comfortable with UNIX, command 
lines.

Thanks for any help.

-Dan.
