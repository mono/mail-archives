Hi all,


while developing Npgsql, I keep running the nunit-console tests.

~From some time ago, I keep seeing some performance drops when seeing
dots appearing more and more slower in my screen :)

I thought it could be some overhead I could be adding to Npgsql, but
after some svn ups and no Npgsql modifications I could see a little more
performance drop.

I downloaded an 1.0 source release just to confirm what I was seeing.

These are my results:


~From Mono 1.0

~ which mono
/home/fxjr/Desenvolvimento/SourceRepositories/MonoCommit/install2.0/bin/mono


I'm assuming that as the nunit command is being called with just mono it
is using the mono in my path.



Also, from long time, I could also see that disk writing performance has
been suffering very much. Or it was the code which retrieves the process
id, because when I turn Npgsql log on, the performance gets even worst
and npgsql log writes to disk and get the current time and process id.

And that disk performance change was a single snapshot, I mean, it
hasn't be increasing and it was from a release to other. I think it
started happening in 0.35, sorry for not reporting that before, but I
thought it could be some code which would be fixed/optimized later, but
it wasn't.

I don't know, but I think it could be some network code, because I can
see from server logging that Npgsql queries are taking more time to go
to server.

Please note that I didn't do any extensive performance tests about that.
I just noticed that when running Npgsql nunit-tests.

Please, give it a try with some performance code to check if this
happens to you too.


If there is something I can do to help testing, please let me know.



Thanks in advance.
