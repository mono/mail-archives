<PRE>On a Redhat Fedora Core 2 box with mono 1.05 installed, I'm suddenly having
more problems with my mono development platform.  When I attempt to open a C
sharp file in the IDE, the IDE crashes out or alternately gives me the error
message &quot;Nautilus does not have a viewer for this file type.&quot;  The same goes
for aspx files or other files I'm just trying to view with-if I make new
files I almost never have the problem, but opening a file I've just closed
does.

After the crash I have three mono's in my processlist, listed in this order
and all with time 00:00:00

.

mono

mono &lt;defunct&gt;

mono

ps

 

I also seem to have some remnant files from mono 1.02

I used redcarpet to install mono 1.02, but switched over to YUM after I
could no longer get redcarpet to find the mono server.

 

Do I need to somehow clean out older distributions?  Is there a way to check
my component list and see where the problem is coming from?  

 

I can still compile from the command line with mcs, and I'm still using
Visual studio to do a lot of the 'pretty' work of writing, but I'd kinda
like to work with the mono based IDE or figure out an alternate IDE to use
so I can work directly on the test linux machine I'm developing from and
avoid those laborious hours spent hacking the visual studio files so that
they can eventually compile.

 

Any hints or IDE walk-throughs would be great.

 

Jason
