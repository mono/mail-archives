<PRE>Thanks. I've made changes to OciDefineHandle and have cured nearly all the failures I had been experiencing. I have started on OracleParameter as it has an object called indicator that is used by the OCIBindxxx calls and appears to suffer from the same problem. I was allocating the object in native memory in the constructors and was going to free them in a destructor. However, in my test runs I see I'm allocating 1200+ objects but only freeing ~900. Would you elaborate on your final comment &quot;failing to dispose...&quot; as I'm reading this as I don't need to Marshal.FreeHGlobal() the object I allocated in the constructors.
