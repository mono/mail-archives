Yes, 3.6.0 is released now, I did the uploads yesterday evening. I'm 
still finding my feet on process and procedure for releases but that 
should improve in the coming months.

&gt;<i> I will update the <A HREF="http://monotizen.com">http://monotizen.com</A> page to include links to the Tizen
</I>&gt;<i> RPMs, and make my own announcement.
</I>
In the short term, I think that's the best plan - there's a bucket of 
stuff on my TODO list to help reach a wider Linux-based audience, but I 
don't have the systems and procedures in place right now for anything 
Tizen-related to make sense (there's more to it than just adding some VMs).

You would likely reach the Tizen developer community far more 
effectively than I would, right now. Down the line, as I find my feet 
more and get the underlying structures in place, coordinating becomes 
much easier.
