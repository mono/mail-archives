<PRE>Hello,

Wanted to follow up to Neale's comment, as he clarified an important point
that I overlooked.

There are two ref parameters that are being passed to unmanaged code, both
point to fields inside the OciDefineHandle managed type.

Neale's analysis is correct: the object might move and with it, the two
short variables that were passed to OciDefineByPos.   This would explain
the crashes that developers are experiencing with the OracleClient provider
and Sgen.

The proposed fix is one possible solution: to allocate the values outside
of the managed heap for both the short values.

There is another suspicious use that we should look into.  The
OciDefineByPos method is actually a set of overloaded methods, with
different types for the &quot;value&quot; parameter.    It is often a handle that is
usually allocated via an unmanaged API.   But there are a few troubling
uses:

   - ref value: used in DefineTimeStamp
   - ref value: when passing the reference to a Handle defined in a
   separate class, DefineLob, DefineInterval

The above does not look very easy to fix.

Given that these are resources that should be explicitly disposed, perhaps
what we should do is allocate a GCHandle for the OciDefineHandle object
(from OciStatementHandle, the one place that creates these objects) and
also create GCHandles for the objects that we use their Handle fields from
(in DefineTimeStamp, DefineLob, DefineInterval) and release the GCHandles
in the respective Dispose methods.

Miguel
