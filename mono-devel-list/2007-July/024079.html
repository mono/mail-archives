Hi,

I am working on a project which required parsing C# source file and consequently building the CodeDOM tree of the code and finding all the redundant classes/methods in the code.


I found the Mono project (MONO IDE) and thinking of using the MCS or the GMCS
Compilers to parse the source code and build CodeDOM tree.
However, I could not found any documentation about the GMCS or MCS API's.
I am looking out for some documentation on the usage of API of MCS or GMCS. Any help in this is appreciated. Please also share your experience on usage of MCS and GMCS. Further, any inputs on my challenge of building CodeDOM tree from C# code are welcome.

Best Regards,
Sachith MD
