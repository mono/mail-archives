</I>
I've read the comments on the bug, I created it ;)

The thing is that it seems that only very strange and corner cases 
return null, for example, getting the public key from an AssemblyName 
object created by the developer in the same program, instead of 
extracting it from a known type. (I suppose that NHibernate guys, on the 
whole life of their application, haven't reached to these corner 
cases..., and then suppose that when a developer that uses NHibernate, 
his datamodel assembly won't return null ever...)

That's why my second patch proposes to invert the FIXME: return not null 
always and put in the FIXME that we should return null sometimes. That 
way I think Mono is more robust. But anyway I suppose that what is 
needed is good NUnit cases for this kind of tricky situations and then 
be absolutely sure what and when is correct to do so. I just haven't had 
time to write them to be checked in (at least as NotWorking in the 
beggining, as some people have adviced).

Regards,
