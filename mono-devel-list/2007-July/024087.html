Those pages [1] haven't been updated for a long time.  There is a copy
in trunk/release/scripts, but I'm not sure if those scripts were the
ones that generated the webpages.  Sorry I can't be of more help.  I
think the person who wrote the scripts is no longer an employee of
Novell.

There has been some talk about running the testsuite against MS .Net.
Not sure what the current status on this is.  But, since many of the
tests use Nunit, which I believe can output to several formats, you
should be able to do some nice comparisons if you were able to get
results from running under MS .Net.
