<PRE>On Wed, 11 Jul 2007 14:02:04 +0300, &quot;Dumitru Ban&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">dban at dako.ro</A>&gt; scribbled:

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>Hey Dumitru,

&gt;<i> I have a machine (Lenovo T60, T2400 @ 1.83GHz, 1.5GB RAM) running Ubuntu
</I>&gt;<i> Feisty (2.6.20.16-generic), Apache 2.2.3 and the latest mono, xsp, mod_mono
</I>&gt;<i> etc. (taken from svn). And I have a web application that gets its pages
</I>&gt;<i> served really, really slow. A lot of times I even get the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;System.Web.HttpException: The request timed out.&quot; (see attached). The
</I>&gt;<i> application worked well until I've checked out the last updates from svn
</I>&gt;<i> (July 11th, 2007).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To be sure that there are no problems with my application I've configured
</I>&gt;<i> Apache to be able to browse the XSP samples (/usr/lib/xsp/test). And the
</I>&gt;<i> problem is still there. For example, the /demo/index.aspx page sometimes
</I>&gt;<i> takes more than 1 minute to be served. The same is happening for
</I>&gt;<i> browsercaps.aspx, includetest.aspx or htmltable.aspx. At the beggining I
</I>&gt;<i> thought that it takes a long time only when the page is served for the first
</I>&gt;<i> time, due to compiling process, but unfortunatelly this is not true. It
</I>&gt;<i> happens like 3 out of 5 times.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then I've checked out the sources from April 1st, 2007. I've compiled and
</I>&gt;<i> installed everything and my application and the test one were working
</I>&gt;<i> perfectly. Every page is served in less that 1-2 seconds.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, in both cases I've also tried to serve the pages using xsp2. And it
</I>&gt;<i> worked well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone have any idea about what the problem could be?
</I>Yep, check this bug report - <A HREF="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=82012,">http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=82012,</A>
this is what's causing it

best regards,

marek
