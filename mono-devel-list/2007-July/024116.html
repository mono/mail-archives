</I>&gt;<i> I'm wondering if any of you have started working on a port, which would definitely influence my purchasing decision (not that I'm against starting the debugging with the debug board for our Mono ARM port, it is ARM right?) I would enjoy nothing more than to upgrade my phone with the OpenMoko phone, but the ability to start working on mobile Mono applications on it as well would be nice, not that the Nokia's aren't nice, but they're not as open :-P

Yes, I'm working on the OpenEmbedded recipes for Mono that will be
used to generate the mono packages.  Things are not working yet, but
hopefully will be at some point.  Mono runs fine on my n770 tablet,
but still does some strange things on OE based distros.  I sent an
email to the list yesterday, but for some reason it appears to have
been lost -- I'll send again shortly.

&gt;<i> If I purchase the kit, I'll be purchasing the Neo Advanced set which includes the nice development extras (woot) and wouldn't mind a coffee shop hack-a-thon in the San Francisco area to get things started if anybody's up for it.

Help is quite welcome :-)
