Sounds great! Are you thinking it'll be worth chipping out for the  
advanced set with the debug board as well for Mono/Moonlight  
development? Or might the ability to hack on the single (Neo Basic)  
phone be enough? Just curious, they had me at &quot;black carrying case&quot;

I wouldn't imagine this to be hard since OpenMoko (at least now)  
ships with a full libX11, along with plenty of other graphic  
libraries that make it seem like the most difficult aspect of the  
port would be getting the hosting of the Moonlight widgets working.  
That said, I guess we'll know Silverlight/Moonlight has &quot;made it&quot;  
when I can punch the monkey, on my phone :)

Regardless, please share your experiences with the getting the phone  
if you can, I'm definitely interested in hearing how the process goes  
as I'll probably be ordering early next week.


Cliff, have you successfully gotten OpenMoko up and running in QEMU  
just yet? I'm starting by tinkering with qemu-arm to see just how  
much of the Mono/Arm codebase will build and working back from there.
