<PRE>Hi Paolo,

&gt;&gt;<i> I am stuck with my ppc64 port of the JIT so I was hoping to test the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interpreter to see if that works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Event if the interpreter compiled, it wouldn't work on ppc64.
</I>&gt;<i> It would be better if you detailed the issues you have with the ppc64
</I>&gt;<i> port instead because we could help you with that.
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!
</I>
Due to its size I uploaded my unfinished patch to Bugzilla:
<A HREF="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=81455">http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=81455</A>

PATCH:

First, it includes changes to eglib/configure.in to make it compile  
on OS X and adds VPATH support to facilitate compiling for ppc and  
ppc64.
configure.in is patched to define POWERPC or POWERPC64 depending on  
the pointer size (and a workaround fixes building monoburg w/eglib on  
OS X for now).
Next, it reorganizes the ppc-codegen.h (header still needs some  
changes Miguel requested) - instructions are now listed  
alphabetically separated from the mnemonics with additions and  
updates for the 64-bit and 32-bit-only instructions.
Then, the mini and arch ppc files were updated with #ifdefs for ppc64  
doing all kinds of necessary changes. I have some FIXMEs/CHECKMEs in  
there, especially some numeric offsets and alignments are unclear to  
me. This is where I suspect the most issues.
Finally, all occurrences of ppc in the sources were checked and adapted.

CONFIGURATION:

I configure Mono --with-gc=none --with-glib=embedded --with-ikvm- 
native=no while exporting CC=&quot;gcc -arch ppc64&quot; (as well as setting  
ACLOCAL_FLAGS, PKG_CONFIG, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS  
appropriately), using a ppc Mono installation of the same revision  
for bootstrapping. (configuring without GC first to rule that out as  
a source of errors)

TEST ENVIRONMENT AND RESULTS:

Test system was a PowerMac G5 dual-core with OS X v10.4.8/9/10.

The ppc Mono is symlinked from /Library/Mono.framework and used &quot;for  
production&quot; - it works fine with this patch applied as far as I can  
tell. There are no other potentially conflicting Mono installations.

The ppc64 Mono runtime compiles fine. Fixing some earlier bugs it now  
runs like a normal app so I can kill it using Ctrl+C. However, on  
compilation of System.dll using the new mono (or on execution of a  
hello world assembly) it aborts with empty stacktrace:

MONO_PATH=&quot;../../class/lib/basic:$MONO_PATH&quot; /Users/andreas/Mono/mono- 
ppc64/mono/runtime/mono-wrapper  ../../class/lib/basic/mcs.exe / 
codepage:65001   -d:NET_1_1 -d:ONLY_1_1 -d:BOOTSTRAP_WITH_OLDLIB - 
debug /noconfig -define:XML_DEP -r:System.Xml.dll -target:library - 
out:System.dll  @System.dll.sources
Stacktrace:

make[8]: *** [../../class/lib/basic/System.dll] Abort trap

$ mono/mini/mono ../../../testassembly.exe
Stacktrace:

Abort trap

According to gdb and some printfs it appeared to enter an infinite  
loop on exception handling during JIT initialization leading to, I  
assume, stack overflow:

$ gdb mono/mini/mono

I haven't been able to locate the error(s) for several months now and  
would appreciate any hints that could lead to some more progress.

Thanks,

Andreas
