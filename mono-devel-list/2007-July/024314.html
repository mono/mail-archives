The short answer is that it should be quite feasible, as Mono has
already been ported to run on ARM.

Furthermore, at least one person on mono-devel-list and #mono has
actually obtained an OpenMoko device to do a port (though I don't know
how it's going).

That doesn't mean it'll be done soon, or that it will actually be easy.
There are still outstanding questions about which ARM ABI the OpenMoko
will be following (which impacts floating point support, as iirc Mono
only supports _some_ of the floating point ARM ABI formats).
