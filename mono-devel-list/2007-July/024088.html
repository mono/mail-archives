Dear Mono Team Member/Developer,

I am working on a Code Optimization project where I have to parse C# source file(s) and consequently build the CodeDOM tree of the code and find
all the redundant classes/methods in the code. I already performed the same analysis on Assembly files but currently need to perform it on source
code as well.


I have looked everywhere for C# parsers but was not successful. I then found out about the Mono project and I'm thinking of using the MCS or the GMCS
compilers to parse through the code and consequently be able to build the CodeDOM tree.

However, I have not found any documentation about the GMCS or MCS API's. Do you have any knowledge or documentation on the API of the MCS or GMCS?

Any help would be much appreciated,
Best Regards,
Sachith MD
