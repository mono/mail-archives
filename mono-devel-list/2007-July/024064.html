&gt;<i> Not really. You just don't want to lose your face when those
</I>&gt;<i> NHibernate guys say &quot;ok, that's totally cosmetic thing we can
</I>&gt;<i> change to support mono&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I keep saying that because I would do the same when other people
</I>&gt;<i> ask for cosmetic harmless changes to make my libraries work with
</I>&gt;<i> .NET. Only moronic people reject such rational choice.
</I>
If NHibernate guys don't even want to test if it works on Mono, I do 
because I am interested. I think it's positive in an open source project 
to work on what you *want* to do. I don't want to bug them for writing 
workarounds for Mono, so if anyone is interested in that, just do it.

BTW, this is the first workaround, but what will happen if after that we 
need 2 or 3 more?, this is also a matter of appearance: perhaps they are 
potential mono users in the future, and many people try a version of 
Mono and if it doesn't work for them, they don't try next time until 
years have passed, and on all that time they keep bashing about how bad 
Mono is; that's why I think it's better to fix Mono than to fix 
NHibernate (even if the fix in NHibernate or other project is so small).

There are more moronic people than you think.
