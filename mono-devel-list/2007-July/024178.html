<PRE>Hello Miguel,

If your team finally decide to go for Madrid option (even Seville
could be nice :-P), some mates and I'd help looking for a place to
host the summit (one of the campus available at this city would be
nice). Even more, I involve myself in finding an University. :-)

Here, at Spain, Microsoft sponsors a large number of University
students clubs, .NET Clubs (<A HREF="http://www.dotnetclubs.com/clubs/">http://www.dotnetclubs.com/clubs/</A>), which
spend a precious time sharing .NET knowledge with the rest of
community, students or not (companies). Mono has been since the very
beginning one of the active topics (projects, talks, etc.), so I'm
*pretty sure* summit would be highly populated by all of us.

As an example, here you have a large amount of material within the
club located at my High School:
<A HREF="http://recursos.dotnetclubs.com/sevilla/.">http://recursos.dotnetclubs.com/sevilla/.</A> And, the Mono talk (one of
them) given by some mates:
<A HREF="http://recursos.dotnetclubs.com/sevilla/Charlas/2005-06/DNC-Sevilla-13-Introducci%C3%B3n%20a%20Mono/">http://recursos.dotnetclubs.com/sevilla/Charlas/2005-06/DNC-Sevilla-13-Introducci%C3%B3n%20a%20Mono/</A>
.

Thanks.

&gt;<i> Hello folks,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Am trying to decide on a location for the next Mono summit.   One of
</I>&gt;<i> the challenges of the summit is that the Mono team is now pretty large,
</I>&gt;<i> so it is quite expensive to fly and host everyone, so am trying to pick:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         * An affordable city (good hotel prices).
</I>&gt;<i>         * Hopefully easy to reach by cheap flights.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Am not sure what format we should have for this year.   Am not sure
</I>&gt;<i> that having a strict schedule with talks was all that great last year, I
</I>&gt;<i> felt that we had too little free time to talk among us than we did
</I>&gt;<i> listening to presentations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      So am thinking:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         * Limit the presentations to a handful, on key topics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         * Organize the rest in an un-conference style, kind of like a
</I>&gt;<i>           BOF, where we get people together and people get to discuss
</I>&gt;<i>           things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Ideally, we should host this in a University, as the hotel that we
</I>&gt;<i> picked last time in Boston was far from ideal as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Some cities that I think might be within range are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         * Boston, but we have to be careful with the time, due
</I>&gt;<i>           to the city being expensive for a bunch of special events.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         * Prague, has a SUSE/Novell office, but there are few direct
</I>&gt;<i>           flights to it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         * Madrid, potentially we could find a University there that
</I>&gt;<i>           could host us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Am afraid that Mexico and South America will be expensive to reach
</I>&gt;<i> for Europeans, but if the cost is not too larger, we could pick a city
</I>&gt;<i> in Mexico (We all know that Mike Kestner wants Cancun, but having been
</I>&gt;<i> there for a conference once, I can attest that most attendees skip on
</I>&gt;<i> the meetings).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Which probably means &quot;Do your conference in Boston, in mid
</I>&gt;<i> February&quot; to guarantee attendance ;-).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Miguel.
