<PRE>Hi Paolo,

&gt;<i> It sounds like you want to get weak references to the interesting
</I>&gt;<i> objects (mono_gchandle_new_weakref() in the embedded API or the
</I>&gt;<i> low-level GCHandle in managed code)
</I>* We do a bunch of &quot;temporary memory&quot; allocations which will be  
cleaned up by the gc immediately afterwards when eg. leaving the  
function that allocated the memory.
Those allocations have to be really fast and i don't want to incur  
any extra performance penalty during normal operation.
* When loading a new level, we have a bunch of time to unload unused  
objects. We are doing a full gc_collect at this point already anyway,  
so walking it one more time isn't gonna make a big difference me thinks.

i'll gladly go with mono_gchandle_new_weakref solution you mentioned,  
if you think there is no real overhead in our use case.
Basically i would need to know that mono_gchandle_new_weakref has no  
noticable overhead when the primary use case is quickly allocating  
temporary memory (Those are always wrapper objects containing 8 bytes  
of data) and letting it be garbage collected shortly after.

&gt;<i> It does, but the way it does it is not exposed and it will never be
</I>&gt;<i> exposed (because it's an internal detail and the user can't perform
</I>&gt;<i> the same traversal safely).
</I>Modifying the mono code for this is not a problem. Is there some  
piece of code i could look at to see how to do this?

Best regards,
Joachim Ante
