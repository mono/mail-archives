<PRE>2007/7/17, Miguel de Icaza &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">miguel at ximian.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hello folks,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Am trying to decide on a location for the next Mono summit.   One of
</I>&gt;<i> the challenges of the summit is that the Mono team is now pretty large,
</I>&gt;<i> so it is quite expensive to fly and host everyone, so am trying to pick:
</I>

How much is it ? That is, what is the range of prices?

        * An affordable city (good hotel prices).
&gt;<i>         * Hopefully easy to reach by cheap flights.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Am not sure what format we should have for this year.   Am not sure
</I>&gt;<i> that having a strict schedule with talks was all that great last year, I
</I>&gt;<i> felt that we had too little free time to talk among us than we did
</I>&gt;<i> listening to presentations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      So am thinking:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         * Limit the presentations to a handful, on key topics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         * Organize the rest in an un-conference style, kind of like a
</I>&gt;<i>           BOF, where we get people together and people get to discuss
</I>&gt;<i>           things.
</I>



     Ideally, we should host this in a University,


That would be a good idea, but guess there must be some event running along
side.


as the hotel that we
&gt;<i> picked last time in Boston was far from ideal as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Some cities that I think might be within range are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         * Boston, but we have to be careful with the time, due
</I>&gt;<i>           to the city being expensive for a bunch of special events.
</I>

Nop, have no visa :D

        * Prague, has a SUSE/Novell office, but there are few direct
&gt;<i>           flights to it.
</I>

would be nice

        * Madrid, potentially we could find a University there that
&gt;<i>           could host us.
</I>

would be excelent

     Am afraid that Mexico and South America will be expensive to reach
&gt;<i> for Europeans, but if the cost is not too larger, we could pick a city
</I>&gt;<i> in Mexico (We all know that Mike Kestner wants Cancun, but having been
</I>&gt;<i> there for a conference once, I can attest that most attendees skip on
</I>&gt;<i> the meetings).
</I>

well some city with no beach and university..... Mexico City?

     Which probably means &quot;Do your conference in Boston, in mid
&gt;<i> February&quot; to guarantee attendance ;-).
</I>

No way :P

Miguel.
