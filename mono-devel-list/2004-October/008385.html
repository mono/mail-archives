In the &quot;mono&quot; CVS module, read everything in the &quot;docs&quot; directory (in
particular &quot;docs/mini-doc.txt&quot;).

The JIT compilation code is in mono/mini.  (The mono/jit directory is an
older version of the JIT engine; mono/mini is the current version.)

It should also be noted that there is no support to &quot;re-JIT&quot; a class. 
Classes are only JITted once.

A JIT engine *is* a compiler, so books about compilers are very
pertinent. :-)

The other parts of the &quot;runtime&quot; include mono/io-layer, a Win32 API
compatible layer which is used for file I/O (to simplify Windows/Unix
portability); libgc, the garbage collector; mono/metadata, for metadata
handling (e.g. getting the classes &amp; class members within an assembly);
and other support areas (profiling, platform-specific code, etc.).

Then there's the C# class library, in the &quot;mcs&quot; CVS module, in the
&quot;class/ASSEMBLY-NAME&quot; directory.

You should also read the Papers section of the mono site: 

	<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/about/papers.html">http://www.mono-project.com/about/papers.html</A>

As for how all the disparate parts fit together, I don't know of any
books that discuss it.

I would also suggest that you read up on ContextBoundObject, which is
another way to get AOP-like behavior within .NET.  (Summary: it uses the
remoting infrastructure to &quot;capture&quot; method calls &amp; member access.  It's
like remoting, but *within* an AppDomain instead of between AppDomains. 
This would allow you to &quot;easily&quot; trace method calls, AFAIK a common AOP
example.)  The downside to ContextBoundObject is that it &quot;burns a base
class&quot;, so you can't use it in all circumstances.
