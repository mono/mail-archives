<PRE>Hello guys,

I am not sure if this is the right list for my
question, but it sure has the people that use mono...

OK, sometime ago I compiled and installed mono from
source. As the directory for the mono installation I
by mistake specified /user/... and not /usr as I
wanted to. Everything was working fine though and I
could compile and run programs under mono. Later I
decided to install everything through yum, including
monodevelop. I thought I uninstalled everything
cleanly and installed mono through yum using this
command:

yum -C install mono-core-devel and mono-runtime-devel

Now everything is working fine as far as mcs is
concerned. The moment I run my application through
mono though, it tells me that mscorlib.dll couldn't be
located and it is looking for it in /user/...
directory. After looking at my system, I couldn't find
mscorlib.dll anywhere (using locate). How can the
system forget about prev location starting with
/user... and how can I make the yum to cleanly install
all the mono required files and dlls?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Laimis
