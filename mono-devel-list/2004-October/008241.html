<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Yes, CVS hates me as well. Anyone have any idea when this might be fixed?
</I>
I'm waiting on a reply from Miguel, then we can have a happy anoncvs
server running from the School of Music, Media and Performance,
University of Salford - lots of bandwidth, lots of space on the drive,
very very low fail rate :-)

With luck, he'll get back to me and we can have something up in the next
24 hours.

TTFN

Paul
(a guy with a server that has lots of bandwidth, lots of space on the
drive and a very very low fail rate...)

Lisa: No, thanks. Do you have any fruit? 
Homer: This has purple stuff inside. Purple is a fruit.
