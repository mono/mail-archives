<PRE>Hi

I have an idea for a project, which I would very much like to be made.
However, I do not have time to make it, as I have a job and is already
busy with the C#Shell project (<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/csshell">http://sourceforge.net/projects/csshell</A>).
In this mail I will explain the idea and hopefully somebody will be
interested in analyzing, designing, and implementing the project.

Basically it should be a program which translates .Net CLI files (the
files a C# compiler outputs) to a Dia class diagram.

As .Net has reflection capabilities, I think this would be a lot smaller
task than translating C++ code to Dia class files. Dia uses an open and
easily understood format, this should also ease the implementation of
this project.

By using .Net CLI files we would not just get a C#2Dia translator but a
translator for all .Net languages.

There are certain features, it would be nice if a program like this had:

	- Updating of Dia class diagram. If a user made some .Net program and
translated it to Dia, via .Net2Dia, he would likely lay out the classes
in Dia differently than .Net2Dia could do automatically. The next time
he uses .Net2Dia on his .Net program .Net2Dia should not throw away his
layout in Dia, but should remember it and just add the new classes to
the Dia diagram.

	- Double clicking on a method could bring bring the source file forward
in a text editor and the cursor should be placed where the method is
defined.
	
It would also be nice to have Dia2.Net, but that would require different
code for each supported language.

Please comment on the idea above. I am interested in both people who
think it is good and people who think it sucks. Or from people who know
of projects which is similar to this one.

If anybody would be interested in implementing this project please let
yourself be know.


Regards,

Mads Lindstr&#248;m
