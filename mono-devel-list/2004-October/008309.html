I disagree with you.  

The reason for another platform is that most of the creators of these
languages don't trust mono, or rather don't trust that mono will always
be available.  To them, mono is Microsoft's platform, and they don't
want to be beholden to Microsoft in any way.  This is why parrot was
started in the first place.  As much as I get frustrated by people who
avoid Mono simply because it's tied to Microsoft, they do have a very
valid point.  And while Microsoft's exercise of control (and potential
to disrupt open-source use of .NET) over mono means little to me for
most application development, in terms of staking your entire language
and environment on it, there are questions that have yet to be
answered. 

IronPython indeed proved that dynamic languages can run under .NET quite
successfully.  Thus we can have .NET as yet another one of many targets
for Python, or PHP, or Perl or whatever.  This makes the languages even
more portable.

WThere is also no reason why parrot itself couldn't benefit from
advancements in JIT technology.  I don't consider it wasted effort at
all.
