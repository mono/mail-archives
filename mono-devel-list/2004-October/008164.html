Interesting. I wasn't aware that mono and STL were friends. It must have
been the fact that the STL is a C++ library that threw me off.


As for the initial issue.

Installing FC1/2 RPMS on a RH9 machine, and then wondering exactly why
nothing is working is pretty much asking to be told its because you
installed different rpms.

As far as I knew, RH9 RPMS exist.

I wouldn't recommend that you attempt a cvs install at this point. It
seems like the mono 1.1.1 tarball, libgdiplus tarball, and a cairo
tarball are basically just what you need. I would *completely* clean all
mono related stuff off that computer before you even attempt an install
with the tarballs.

You will want to grab the managed winforms sources from somewhere as
well.

MonoPosixHelper btw, is what implements map_Mono_Posix_PollEvents, and
it is installed by the mono tarball.
