<PRE>Hello Jon,

Thanks for the info. I'll get a look into CanReuseTransform as there is
no reason for Mono not to reuse transforms (and I bet a lot of code
don't bother to check the property). 

I think that a &quot;Reset&quot; method should have been included in
ICryptoTransform (but is a little too late for that ;-).

Thanks

</I>&gt;<i> The behaviour you described is correct. TransformFinalBlock does indeed
</I>&gt;<i> reset the feedback.
</I>&gt;<i> I believe this is consistent with the intent of the class. The
</I>&gt;<i> CanReuseTransform property returns true, which means the feedback should at
</I>&gt;<i> some point be reset so the class can be reused.
</I>&gt;<i> You have to look at this from the perspective of individual messages. Once
</I>&gt;<i> you end a message, you must call TransformFinalBlock, and this resets the
</I>&gt;<i> feedback register to the IV for the next message. You have to remember that
</I>&gt;<i> message reception may or may not be synchronous, so for example, you can
</I>&gt;<i> encrypt various files and they will simply sit somewhere until you decrypt
</I>&gt;<i> one of them. You can't assume that you are shipping a bunch of message
</I>&gt;<i> around and they will all be dealt with in the same order. If the feedback
</I>&gt;<i> isn't reset, that's the only way you could ever decrypt them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, CBC mode induces feedback. This means that subsequent strings of
</I>&gt;<i> similar plain text will be affected by previous blocks of cipher text. So,
</I>&gt;<i> for example, if you had repeating sets of the letter &quot;E&quot; in your message,
</I>&gt;<i> the blocks containing that repetition couldn't be detected from the cipher
</I>&gt;<i> text because of the CBC feedback. CBC doesn't guarantee that entirely
</I>&gt;<i> similar messages won't look the same after decryption, especially if you are
</I>&gt;<i> using the same IV. If you have a scenario like this (where you are sending
</I>&gt;<i> the same message over and over using the same IV), you should salt the
</I>&gt;<i> message - add a block of random bits to the beginning of the message. On the
</I>&gt;<i> receiving end, you can safly ignore the first block, and that guarantees
</I>&gt;<i> each message will be different due to the CBC feedback.
