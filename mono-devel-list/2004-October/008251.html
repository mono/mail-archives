<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> &gt; the developers use a different cvs server.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That one offers anonymous readonly access.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; --Todd
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> i don't get it: is that a justification for the pathetic
</I>&gt;<i> uptime/reliability we have been seeing on anoncvs lately? that the
</I>&gt;<i> 'developers' use another server? hmm, okay...
</I>
AnonCVS is not a service offered by Novell, it is a service offered by
volunteers in the community that have kindly donated disk space to the
effort and resources.

In this particular case the Spainsh mirror (one of two active sites, one
of them seem to not expose anoncvs anymore) has run out of disk space.

Am working with Paul who has been kind enough to offer another mirror,
so we can have another server.

Miguel.

</PRE>
