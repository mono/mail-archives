And then there's the easiest way to ensure that you only get one
instance, and it doesn't require any explicit locking: use the static
constructor:

	private static Singleton instance = new Singleton();

But that's what got us into this conversation in the first place.

As a note, this is the only safe way to create a singleton in Java
(before their major memory model re-write).

It also has all the benefits of the other techniques -- the singleton is
created lazily (unless beforefieldinit is set, in which case things can
get optimized, and optimization is good anyway), only one instance is
ever constructed, and you don't need to worry about locking (the runtime
handles it).  What could be nicer?
