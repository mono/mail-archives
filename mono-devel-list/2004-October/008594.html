<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> Why can't/won't we do the same with SWF on top of wxWidgets.NET ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>That's the question I meant to ask. :-)
</I>
wxWidgets controls do not provide all the features the matching SWF 
counterparts require. =&gt; That means we'd have to implement the full control 
ourselves in managed code. That's one of the same issues we had with Wine, 
too, btw.

wxWidgets does not provide all the events to match what's required for SWF.

If we were to ignore those points and implemented the controls, and only 
used the underlying window system interface, we would have the issue of 
making System.Drawing/cairo play nice with the device contexts from 
wxWidgets before we could display anything. And then we would still have an 
additional intermediate layer, as opposed to what we have now, which goes 
directly to the OS.

Before we started over on SWF, we did go over various options and choices, 
including wxWidgets, but none of them was suitable to get the work done any 
faster or any better.
