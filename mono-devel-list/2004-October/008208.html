<PRE>&gt;<i>Where can I find the status of Mono.Security.Protocol.Tls? I've looked
</I>&gt;<i>at the class status pages
</I>
Status pages are built so people can easily compare Mono class library with
MS class library. However this doesn't make sense for Mono specific
assemblies.

&gt;<i> but i only managed to find out that it is 100%
</I>&gt;<i>managed code, not whether it is 100% done or not ;-)
</I>
Tls: An 100% managed SSLv3 and TLSv1 implementation from Carlos Guzman
Alvarez.
from <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/contributing/crypto.html">http://www.mono-project.com/contributing/crypto.html</A>

The Mono.Security assembly is one of the few sections without a TODO entry.
I guess that's a good hint ;-)
Another one is the fact the Mono use this class for it's own HTTPS support
for WebRequest.
Finally when in doubt read the sources ;-).

&gt;<i>Documentation about the class is quite scarce and i have done a little
</I>&gt;<i>trial and error coding with it.
</I>
The design of SslClientStream is based on the .NET Fx 1.2 preview from the
last PDC. Luckily it seems that the original documentation is still online!

<A HREF="http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/lhsdk/ref/ns/system.net/c/sslclientstream">http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/lhsdk/ref/ns/system.net/c/sslclientstream</A>
/sslclientstream.aspx

Warning: I was surprised that this old documentation (1.2 preview) was still
available now that 2.0 beta 1 is released. I have the feeling that it may
disappear at any moment.

&gt;<i>I've noticed for instance that accessing
</I>&gt;<i>the Length property triggers a NotImplementedException so I guess it is
</I>&gt;<i>not 100% yet.
</I>
This should be a NotSupportedException (see SslClientStream.Length source
code) and it's completely normal as you can't know the length of a network
stream (see NetworkStream.Length documentation). This is true for many kind
of streams (and not just for Length).

&gt;<i>This is acually my first try at c# and mono so it might just be that I
</I>&gt;<i>have no clue about what I'm doing, but what I'm trying to do is to
</I>&gt;<i>establish asynchronous communication with a sort of chat server.
</I>&gt;<i>Writing seems to work fine but I have a problem with reading. When doing
</I>&gt;<i>BeginWrite with a callback function the code continues executing as
</I>&gt;<i>expected even though the callback function hasn't finished. But when
</I>&gt;<i>doing BeginRead, execution halts until the callback returns.
</I>&gt;<i>Is this expected behaviour or...? When looking at examples of
</I>&gt;<i>asynchronous communication on simple TCP sockets I got the picture that
</I>&gt;<i>execution should continue after an asynchronous read.
</I>
Some parts are blocking, like the handshake (IIRC), which must be done when
initiating the channel.

If possible I suggest that you make your code 100% working without SSL. Then
add SSL (debugging network sessions with encrypted data isn't really fun for
most people). Adding SSL is really easy if your code is stream based (have a
look at Mono's HTTPS support in System.dll).

&gt;<i>Oh by the way. I'm using mono 1.0.2 on linux.
</I>
&gt;<i>Thank you very much in advance!
