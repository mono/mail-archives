I don't believe this was ever in question

Ditto.

This was part of the debate, but a fairly minor part.  It's nice to know
there's an exception for open-source projects, in any event.

</I>
And this is where the issue pops up.  The Mono class libraries are
MIT/X11.  The runtime libraries are LGPL.  Gnome's libraries are LGPL.

The basic idea behind Gnome and Mono is that there be a large number of
freely-licensable code which *proprietary* apps can use without worrying
about licensing.  This is one of the points that Qt/GTK+ debates
frequently brings up -- Qt requires a Trolltech license for proprietary
software, GTK+ doesn't.  That's just the entire world-view of Gnome and
Mono.

It's because Mono is trying to target proprietary vendors that the MySQL
connector license change generated so much debate.  Many people don't
want to pay a license fee to use MySQL.  Add to that MySQL's strange
interpretation of when you need to pay a license, and you get a lot of
people who'd rather avoid the issue.  (The &quot;strange interpretation&quot; is
that MySQL states that proprietary web sites need to pay a license fee,
even though the website's backend of isn't ever distributed -- as the
GPL interprets distribution -- and thus don't need to follow the GPL,
gaping loop-hole that this is.)

Then there's the question of borderline code -- if I only use the
System.Data interfaces and load the MySQL driver at runtime, in a way
that I'll never know that I'm using the MySQL driver (say the driver is
specified in a config file), should I have to pay the MySQL license?  Am
I really a &quot;derivative work&quot;.  Thus starts the path toward lawyers...

The result is that developers would rather maintain an LGPL fork in
Mono's CVS repository than deal with MySQL's driver code.

Or use PostgreSQL.  I'm surprised PostgreSQL isn't mentioned  more
often...

&gt;<i> On another topic, while I am confident of the skills of the Mono crowd,
</I>&gt;<i> it seems awkward to keep my companies name on a product that I am no
</I>&gt;<i> longer involved with.  It may lead to support requests coming to me for
</I>&gt;<i> work I have not done.  
</I>
This would be a good reason to revert to the Mono.Data.MySQL name and
not continue the ByteFX naming convention.  Sounds like a good reason to
me, though I'm not actually contributing to the code in any event...
