<PRE>Hi!

I am trying to make some investigation on 
<A HREF="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=61152">http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=61152</A>
so I tracked what is called by Assembly.LoadFrom. It seems that this is the 
same code, which is used by runtime to load referenced assemblies 
(mono_assembly_load_from in metadata/assembly.c).

Can anybody comment if it is true? I don't think that erasure of runtime 
loaded assemblies by reflecting some with the same name is a good behaviour.

But even if it is, is shouldn't cause setting system_assembly in socket-io.c 
to NULL. 

I wanted to do some more debugging, but I have some problems running mono cvs 
version:
checking how to run the C++ preprocessor... /lib/cpp
configure: error: C++ preprocessor &quot;/lib/cpp&quot; fails sanity check
See `config.log' for more details.

The config.log file ends with some invalid preprocessor directives:
#define VERSION &quot;1.1.1&quot;
#endif
#ifdef __cplusplus
void exit (int);

It's probably some issue with automake generating bad configure script...

Sorry for this probably bogus message, but the 61152 problem is open now for a 
few months and IMHO it seems to be quite critical issue. Especially if it 
occurs in some more sofisticated scenarios with reflecting assemblies with 
various versions.

Just to put some positive comments, you guys are doing great job. According to 
our summary (<A HREF="http://nemerle.org/wiki/index.php/Runtime_issues">http://nemerle.org/wiki/index.php/Runtime_issues</A>), mono has 
currently less open bugs interfering with our project than MS.NET.
