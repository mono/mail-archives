<PRE>Hi,
In Vb .Net program if someone is using a older version of
Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll (7.0.3300.0) the program fails to run on
mono.
Cause in mono we have 7.0.5000.0 version of Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll 
This scenario occurs mostly when one has compiled the program in VS.Net
2003.

Since, Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll is the heart of VB.net and its as
important as System* libraries for vb programs, I believe we should
remap this dll in the runtime as we are doing it for other System*
assemblies.

Here, I have attached a patch with this mail which actually resolves
this problem.
But, this throws an warning while remapping the assembly.
I have noticed that for other System* assemblies mono is not throwing
any warning. This means that the remapping is happening for those dlls
before coming to the point where I placed my fix.
I searched for it but couldn't locate where actually this is
happening.

If anyone plz point me where this is happening I will try to fix it so
that the remapping happens transparently to the user.
Otherwise we can submit this patch itself which will let vb users at
least run their program with some warning.
Its important from VB.net point of view, otherwise more and more people
will start getting this problem (I already found couple of those in
mailing list).

Thanks.
Anirban.
