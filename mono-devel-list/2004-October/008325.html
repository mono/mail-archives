<PRE>Here's the &quot;poor-mans&quot; diff between Mono.Posix OEE and CVS-HEAD.

It's the &quot;poor-mans&quot; version because instead of using &quot;cvs diff&quot;, I just
backed up the original directory and ran

        diff -u -p -N BACKUP_DIR NEW_DIR

Why?  So I wouldn't have to &quot;cvs add&quot; files to properly diff the new
files (of which there are many).

Of course, patch files are nearly unreadable, so to *really* see the
code, see previous Mono.Posix OEE announcements on mono-devel-list.

There is one difference between the content of these patches and
Mono.Posix OEE 0.5 (the most recent release): I rewrote make-map.cs, so
it should actually be understandable (somewhat), instead of being the
cross-generation of three different files...

As the patch files are big (~250KB a piece), I'm hosting them on my
personal server (which is on a cable-modem, so don't expect large
amounts of bandwidth.  I can mail the patches to anyone interested.

Patches:
        <A HREF="http://www.jprl.com/~jon/Mono.Posix.dll.patch">http://www.jprl.com/~jon/Mono.Posix.dll.patch</A> is the patch 
                against mcs/class/Mono.Posix/Mono.Posix.
        <A HREF="http://www.jprl.com/~jon/Mono.Posix.support.patch">http://www.jprl.com/~jon/Mono.Posix.support.patch</A> is the patch
                against mono/support

Alas, the only thing it's missing is a ChangeLog entry.  I'll tackle
that in the near future.

It should be noted that Mono.Posix OEE 0.5 was ~17 KLOC, of which over
~10 KLOC was machine-generated (by make-map.cs and stub-vt.pl).  This is
a large-ish patch.

Thanks,
 - Jon
