Paul, I think what Asbjorn was meaning is why don't we write SWF to use
wxWidgets for it's implementation, much like we have done for
libgdiplus. We use cairo to do the heavy lifting and libgdiplus is just
a wrapper that gives cairo a new interface to match up with the MS GDI+
interface. Why can't/won't we do the same with SWF on top of
wxWidgets.NET ?
