<PRE>I just recently rolled RPMs of mono 1.0.2 from the 1.0 specs provided on
the mono website.

Here's the new specs, which have been modified to include many of the
changes I noticed between the 1.0 and 1.0.2 RPMs.

This may be a better starting point for than the specs off the mono
website.

Considering the differences between the rpms, I'm really curious why the
mono packagers page wasn't updated when 1.0.2 was released. At the very
least, having .src.rpms posted to the website would be much more helpful
than being forced to duplicate the differences from the 1.0 spec files.

Subject: [Mono-devel-list] rpm packaging from CVS

I have a recent (9/21/2004) snapshot of the mono cvs repository, which
builds and functions correctly. I am trying to package it into an RPM.
When I run rpmbuild using the spec file provided on the project mono
website, I get several errors relating to missing files. Several of the
supposedly missing files are man pages where the filename in the spec
file does not have .gz at the end, however, there are also missing
.dlls, and other files during packaging. Am I setting things up
correctly? Is there an updated spec file that reflects changes made in
the CVS tree since the spec files were posted? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks
