</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I understand completely.  This is in line with my point actually, that 
being that there is very little in terms of licensing problematic here.  
The real reason for the code replication is to provide as much surface 
area as possible free of charge to more directly encourage use of the 
toolkit and encourage development for Linux in general.  

The main idea I was expressing was more platform-neutral and had to do 
with the free software mindset I see happening more and more (it had 
very little to do with the actual replication of the driver).  More and 
more I see developers wanting software to be free unless they are 
selling it, then of course it should cost money.  And they are not 
interested in paying people licensing fees for the components they use.

I think this mindset just leads to slower development as it requires 
people who are willing to give some of their free time to develop the 
code.  Some projects (like Mono) have corporate sponsorship and that 
allows them to proceed faster.  If you look around the .NET community, 
you will see many components (net components, UI components, etc) and 
almost without fail the for-pay components offer more features more 
quickly than the free ones.  This leads to, I think, a much better open 
source interpretation.  I think the whole idea behind open source should 
not be that &quot;all software is free&quot; but that I have the source code to 
fix bugs or better debug if I want.  The license could really be 
anything as long as the source code is also delivered and I have the 
ability to make changes to the source code for use in my own 
enterprise.  In this situation, I have the personal benefit of open 
source while fostering a component community (with my dollars).

Sorry for my rant.  As you can see, it really had very little to do with 
the code.  As to your argument about an ISV just staying in Windows, I 
think this is incorrect.  If the Linux platform has enough users and the 
Mono toolkit is advanced enough (both are true), then the Linux platform 
can easily support applications and components that use a for-pay 
licensing system.  This is assuming, of course, that I expect to sell 
more than a few copies of my application or library.  If this is not the 
case, why not open source?
