<PRE>I would like to raise some eye brows in concern about using known extension
name for symbol files for mono binaries. as we know, .mdb is used by ms
access database services.

here&#185;s a problem that I&#185;ve been running into:

I need to copy my mono projects between my pc and pocketpc using ActiveSync
or PocketMac. by default setting, ActiveSync will attempt to convert certain
files into pocketpc internal format. .mdb is on that list of files affected
by auto-convertion. as a result I always get damaged .mdb files that need to
be rebuilt.

would it be possible to make a change now to use different extension for
symbol files, anything other than any known registered extensions would be
fine. since .net is using .pdb, why is it we don't want to generate
compatible format as well - for that case binaries compiled on either
platforms can be used everywhere.

is there any specific reason why this cant be done?

thanks for your time to comment on this.

-G.
