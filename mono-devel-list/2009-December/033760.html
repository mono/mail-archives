<PRE>One reason why the upstream Mono tarball is modified in Debian is the
inclusion of a binary AgilityPack.dll without corresponding source. For
curiosity's sake, I tried getting ahold of the source from the Beagle
development tree (as suggested), building it, and replacing the bundled
copy - and it doesn't work. The Beagle copy of HtmlAgilityPack (v1.0)
throws exceptions all over the place if built with a vaguely modern
Mono.

So. Attached is a patch against trunk which replaces AgilityPack.dll
with an HtmlAgilityPack/ directory containing the latest upstream
release from Codeplex (v1.4~beta2). It's integrated into the build
system, happily lives inside tarballs made with &quot;make dist&quot;, and
generally removes any of the issues Debian has with the AgilityPack. Oh,
and it ought to apply against 2-6 and 2-4, although those will require a
slight tweak to docs/Makefile.am to use net_2_0 not net_1_1 for
convert.exe

This combined with my previous RabbitMQ patch remove the lingering
license/security problems which cause Debian to distribute modified
upstream tarballs. Assuming any new ones haven't crept in since 2.4.3.
