Hi all

I'm looking into porting an existing .Net API I develop so that it will also
work under Mono, I have a few third party libraries which I use which I'll
need to change/drop from the Mono port but I'm having some problems solving
one of the issues that the Mono Migration Analyzer is reporting on my own
code.  The message is as follows:

Method missing from Mono - NameValueCollection HttpResponse.get_Headers ()

So looking at the methods that are calling this it appears to just be the
case that I've used code like the following:

String accept = response.Headers[&quot;Accept&quot;];

Which I can replace fairly easily with:

String[] accept = response.AcceptTypes;

The issue is that even after I make this change in all the places where it
occurs I still get the exact same issues reported by MoMA.  Does this mean
that internally the missing method still gets called and hence isn't
portable to Mono?

What partly confuses me is that as far as I can see from the documentation
the method in question should be supported so I'm unsure why MoMA gives an
error anyway?

Thanks,
Rob
