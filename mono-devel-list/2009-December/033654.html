<PRE>Thanks for your reply ;-)

I'm now using the latest version 2.4.2.3.

 

This is the program I'm developing: <A HREF="http://linktalk.net">http://linktalk.net</A>
&lt;<A HREF="http://linktalk.net/">http://linktalk.net/</A>&gt; . In this program, IHttpAsyncHandler, ThreadPool, and
TCP Sockets are heavily used.

I tried to host my program under Apache/XSP, but it had a really poor
performance. So, I tried the HttpListener class, but still not good, and had
lots of SocketExceptions thrown compared to the Windows counterpart.

Lastly, I implemented a simple web server by myself, using Socket listening
and parsing directly. It works better, however, async requests usually
become unresponsive. It seems the ThreadPool is not as good as the .NET
implementation, or maybe there needs some special configuration I don't
know.

 

Under Windows/.NET the program can handle more than 2000 online IM users
concurrently, but on Linux/Mono less than 100 conrrent users, and usually
become unresponsive.

Hello,

 

     The problem is that we would have to migrate the contents.   We tried
once to move to MindTouch's Deki, but we lost too much in the translation
and there were too many problems with the translation so we abandoned that
plan.

 

     We are doing the new web sites using Mono though,
<A HREF="http://monodevelop.com,">http://monodevelop.com,</A> <A HREF="http://wiki.monotouch.net,">http://wiki.monotouch.net,</A> <A HREF="http://monotouch.net,">http://monotouch.net,</A> and
<A HREF="http://forums.monotouch.net">http://forums.monotouch.net</A> are all running with Mono powered software.

 

     As for stability and performance, which version of Mono are you
running?





I was just wondering, why the mono official site was not built on
ASP.NET/C#? That would be a good demonstration.

Currently, I'm developing a Web IM program, and it works fine on
Windows/.NET. However, the same code had a poor performance on Linux/Mono,
and seems very unstable.

So I doubt whether Mono is suitable for developing server programs which
should be able to handle a huge amount of concurrent requests.

I wish the Mono team would pay much more attentions to server applications,
and enhance the server stability or just concentrate on server applications,
not just catching up with Microsoft's new cool features. Because Linux/Unix
is used as server under 90% circumstances, performance and stability is the
most import thing!
