<PRE>Hello,

      The problem is that we would have to migrate the contents.   We  
tried once to move to MindTouch's Deki, but we lost too much in the  
translation and there were too many problems with the translation so  
we abandoned that plan.

      We are doing the new web sites using Mono though, <A HREF="http://monodevelop.com">http://monodevelop.com</A> 
, <A HREF="http://wiki.monotouch.net,">http://wiki.monotouch.net,</A> <A HREF="http://monotouch.net,">http://monotouch.net,</A> and <A HREF="http://forums.monotouch.net">http://forums.monotouch.net</A> 
  are all running with Mono powered software.

      As for stability and performance, which version of Mono are you  
running?

&gt;<i> I was just wondering, why the mono official site was not built on ASP.NET/C#? 
</I>&gt;<i>  That would be a good demonstration.
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, I&#8217;m developing a Web IM program, and it works fine on  
</I>&gt;<i> Windows/.NET. However, the same code had a poor performance on Linux/ 
</I>&gt;<i> Mono, and seems very unstable.
</I>&gt;<i> So I doubt whether Mono is suitable for developing server programs  
</I>&gt;<i> which should be able to handle a huge amount of concurrent requests.
</I>&gt;<i> I wish the Mono team would pay much more attentions to server  
</I>&gt;<i> applications, and enhance the server stability or just concentrate  
</I>&gt;<i> on server applications, not just catching up with Microsoft&#8217;s new  
</I>&gt;<i> cool features. Because Linux/Unix is used as server under 90%  
</I>&gt;<i> circumstances, performance and stability is the most import thing!
</I>&gt;<i>
