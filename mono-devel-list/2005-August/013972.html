<PRE>Hi!

I have a Socket Server and Clients (see attached files). When disconnecting 
the clients the server does not receive exceptions on some of the clients. I 
have a cleanup routine that periodically checks the clients by sending some 
empty data. But this does not work for some of the clients (232 out of 360 
connections are still &quot;alive&quot; on the server after closing the clients).

Actually I created this client and server programs to test this particular 
bug:
<A HREF="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=75812">http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=75812</A>

But this problem does not show in my simplified test programs, but it does 
not work correctly nevertheless. The programs does work on MS .Net (BTW: The 
socket client program does not work on Mono for Windows, maybe this is the 
same problem that the MySql Connector is having on Windows in 1.1.8.3 -&gt; but 
this is a different bug).

Maybe someone can have a look, I would really appreciate that. I have not 
posted any bug reports yet (except for the one above). This is really a 
major issue for me (kind of a show stopper). Maybe I am doing something very 
wrong, I don't know. I am using 1.1.8.3 on Suse Linux 9.2.

Thank you
Bernhard
