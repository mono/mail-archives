The actual code is based on an earlier version of 2.0 (beta 1 IIRC).

Carlos is (or was, it's been some time since we chatted) working on that
so you should contact him before investing time into it. We sure could
use an hand to ensure this new class gets easier to test than the
current SSL/TLS code.

Mono.Security.dll already contains SslClientStream and SslServerStream
classes (which were based on the MS Fx 1.2 preview API) and was done by
Carlos (and a few bits by me). There are a few known bugs (mostly
related to async support) but they are working, including support for
client, server, SSL3, TLS1, client-side certificates ...

Using them would be easier it you want SSL support on both framework (as
Mono.Security.dll doesn't depend on anything Mono specific) including
1.x versions. Unless you are requiring something special/specific wrt
SSL ?
