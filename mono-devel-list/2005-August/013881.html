<PRE>Hugo, 

Please Just Calm Down.

Paolo is a good person and an outstanding developer.. Get over it for
the better outcome for all people.

Back to business:

Why would someone need Mono (the runtime/jit) for a PocketPC? I'll
publish here my thoughts as a developer that worked on some SmartPhone
applications, but please share your thoughts on the subject.

I think it would eat too much memory from the device to duplicate most
of what is already inside WinCE.NET. Also Mono doesn't help in the
most lacking aspect of the Compact Framework that is COM interop,
although it would really improve the native interop (P/Invoking in CF
is a nightmare as it lacks decent marshalling).

Using selected (fully managed) Mono libraries in the CF is another
thing much more useful, and easier to achieve.

I envision that PocketPCs will start to migrate to Linux not just
because it is a cheaper alternative (MS licensing is too costly, for
the projects I'm involved at least) but because MS is evolving the
technology too slowly in this platform/market.

I'm working with XScale/ARM in the embedded hardware space and
Linux/Mono fits the bill nicely for that project.

&lt;pt_BR&gt;Voc&#234; &#233; brasileiro?&lt;/pt_BR&gt;

Regards,
