<PRE>Hello Eyal,

&gt;<i> Attached is a patch for compiling HttpResponseStream.cs under TARGET_JVM.
</I>&gt;<i> Under TARGET_JVM (Grasshopper) we don't support unsafe code. I therefore made the following
</I>&gt;<i> changes to minimize the use of unsafe code and maximize the code sharing:
</I>&gt;<i>   * I created a managed version of Chunk for the TARGET_JVM configuration.
</I>&gt;<i>   * I made ByteBucket a &quot;safe&quot; class
</I>&gt;<i>       * I modified start &amp; pos into indices rather then pointers. I am using the Chunk
</I>&gt;<i> 	to maintain the buffer.
</I>&gt;<i> 	During that I removed the field 'len' which was never well maintained. I replaced
</I>&gt;<i> 	its use with a local variable everywhere.
</I>&gt;<i>       * I added Copy methods to Chunk in order to copy data to and from a chunk. This limited
</I>&gt;<i> 	the unsafe code usage to Chunk.
</I>
This is a really nice and elegant design, thanks for doing this work.

&gt;<i>       * I removed the ToString method since it was unsafe - an alternative is to mark anyway the
</I>&gt;<i> 	ByteBucket class as unsafe. I'd rather it stays safe so we can more easily maintain
</I>&gt;<i> 	common code for this class.
</I>
ToString was just for debugging, we do not really need them.  This is
fine.

&gt;<i> Please provide me with your comments, especially since I am modifying here common code to
</I>&gt;<i> TARGET_JVM and Mono in order to have a minimal code differences between the two.
</I>
Feel free to commit the code.

Miguel.

</PRE>
