Sorry, the patch included the whole file because of whitespace
difference. Please review the fixed patch to make sure it is really
innocent.

In any case, this patch is not mine, it's only a part of the merge.
There are good chances we will write a test fixture for this class. As
you can see, I write tests for all classes I deal with - starting with
basic Point and Rectangle structs, then will follow Pen and Brush and so
on.

What is blocking us now is that our team is partly using our old
ClearCase repository and partly new files from SVN, so I want to do
merge ASAP so everybody can use SVN exclusively. If you can accept those
merge changes without tests, I promise you will be flooded with unit
tests in nearest days :-)

Thank you,
Andrew.
