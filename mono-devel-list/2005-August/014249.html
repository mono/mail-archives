<PRE>Hello,

Attached is a file that we use for our cross platform development.  It 
allows us to build a Linux or Mono release from Visual Studio .NET 2005 
that targets the Mono class libraries including mscorlib in the same 
solution as our .NET 1.1 and .NET 2.0 targets. For those of you who are 
developing cross platform C# and you are using Visual Studio 2005 Beta 2 
as an IDE, this file will probably be useful.

To use it change the line in your csproj file:

&lt;Import Project=&quot;$(MSBuildBinPath)\Microsoft.CSharp.targets&quot; /&gt;

To:

&lt;Import Project=&quot;..\..\Relative\Path\To\Coversant.CSharp.targets&quot;&gt;

This needs to be done in each project file in your solution.  Also you 
may need to adjust the installation path for your mono setup, in the 
targets file.

Once this is done, load up your solution/project. You should notice 
under the Solution platforms you have Linux, Mono 2.0, .NET 1.1, and Any 
CPU.

    * Linux and Mono are basically the same.  They just differ in the
      DefineConstants.
    * .NET 1.1 is to target the old .NET runtime.
    * Any CPU is your standard .NET 2.0 target.
