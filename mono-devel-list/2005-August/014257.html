<PRE>Hello JD,

&gt;<i> I was wondering if there was any synchronization between 
</I>&gt;<i> Novell.Directory.Ldap on Novell forge and Mono. I have 
</I>&gt;<i> noticed that the trees are currently fairly different.
</I>
Currently most of the differences come from my latest changes regarded
to Kerberos authentication support for TARGET_JVM,
but there are some slight changes that does not appear in mono svn.

&gt;<i> I'm trying to make a decision on which to patch, but I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> really know. I am leaning toward patching the one on Novell 
</I>&gt;<i> forge since that seems to be the root, but then when, if 
</I>&gt;<i> ever, would my fixes show up in the Mono tree? 
</I>
You're asking the right question at the right time. You mail is the
first evidence of the problem that should be solved.

In the past I've tried to achieve a contact with somebody continuing
working on this package in Novell (namely, Sunil) in order to discuss
this problem, but failed to do so (actually, I've not no answer).

We can invest in effort and bring all the latest changes from Novell to
Mono svn, but I think we should strive to bring both Novell and Mono
developers to work on the same repository.

Miguel, do you think this change can be made? Can we get some contact
developer in Novell to discuss the latest changes and to synchronize the
code trees? Is it possible to switch the development to the common
repository?
