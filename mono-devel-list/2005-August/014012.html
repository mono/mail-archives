To create detailed implementation plan, I must first find out how the
whole mcs and Reflection.Emit works. I somehow hoped that I will get
anyway with that, but it doesn't seem likely. After all, I must admit
that I am interested in the code anyway - so when I finish all my
schoolwork, I will do some research, produce a battle plan and I will
come back :-)

Do you mean that Cecil can not access the runtime similarly as
Reflection.Emit? Ok, got it.

</I>
Thank you very much, it help me to see the differences between Cecil and
S.R.Emit, however I still do not understand why you do not use Cecil in
S.R.Emit.

Am I correct that Cecil will be powerful assembly reading and writing
library?

And S.R.Emit needs, among other things, read and write libraries. Right?

S.R.Emit does that using unmanaged code now. Right?

Isn't it better to use managed Cecil in S.R.Emit do the reading and
writing of assemblies?
