Ok:-)

It can access it, but only through a very coarse mechanism: assembly
loading.

</I>
Yes, hopefully;-)

&gt;<i> And S.R.Emit needs, among other things, read and write libraries. Right?
</I>
Yes, mostly.

&gt;<i> S.R.Emit does that using unmanaged code now. Right?
</I>
Some managed and some unmanaged.

&gt;<i> Isn't it better to use managed Cecil in S.R.Emit do the reading and
</I>&gt;<i> writing of assemblies?
</I>
No.
The runtime needs to be able to read assemblies before executing them,
so this code must be unmanaged. Having a second copy of the code in
managed form would be just a huge and useless resource waste.
(Yes, I know about jikes-rvm and I also know about the orrible
maintainance issues they have: they can afford it because it's a
research program).
As for writing, re.emit is not obly concerned with writing assemblies,
but also with creating and executing code in memory: this is only
possible with a tight integration with the unmanaged runtime. Some parts
of Re.Emit are already managed code and I guess some small parts of
unamanged code will be moved to managed sometimes in the future.
But this won't involve Cecil in any way: the unmanaged code amounts to
about 40 KB of x86 binary and the Cecil assembly is 300+ KB of IL.
We can't afford to use that much code to implement one of the
fundamental runtime features.
