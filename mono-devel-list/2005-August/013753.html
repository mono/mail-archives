<PRE>Thanks for the reply,

Some people at Microsoft were very kind and have send me their, at the
moment, internal Edit and Continue documentation. I will not repay their
kindness by publishing these documents on public maillist, but if anyone
is interested please let me know and I will send the documentation to you.

ILAsm v2.0 is able to produce metadata deltas which we can use to
further check the implementation.

I have written a debugging library that uses MS debugging API and which
can apply metadata and il deltas to running programs. (So far, it was
successfully test on the output of ildasm)

Thanks for help,

David
