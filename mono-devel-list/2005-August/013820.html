<PRE>Thanks brion,
Using ulimit -n 8192, I worked around my problem, too.

In fact, my program was &quot;looking for problems&quot;, 
I ran a program that loads thousands of jar files into an AppDomain, and
the IBM JVM, probably, does not release them fast enough. 
Once again, I did not have this problem using Sun JVM.

In poking at this some more, I have tried the LD_ASSUME_KERNEL but it
doesn't seem to make a particular difference that I can tell.

What does seem to have helped is raising the open files limit with
ulimit; I've got a few hundred index files, and the daemons were
sometimes getting clogged also with TCP sockets stuck in CLOSE_WAIT
state.

After raising the open file limit from 1024 to 8192 things seem more
reliable; perhaps it was trying to load the library at runtime and
failing? Or perhaps it's completely unrelated...
