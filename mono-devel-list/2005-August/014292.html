Wow! That's the kind of surprise I like when I wake up :-)

We always &quot;sticked&quot; to the Fx 1.2 preview specs for the Ssl[Client|
Server]Stream API and didn't planned to change this before implementing
the new SslStream (in System.dll) for 2.0 - BUT this isn't a major
problem if it doesn't break binary compatibility (for current
applications linked with Mono.Security.dll).

&gt;<i> The only &quot;gotcha&quot; is if you start running low on threadpool threads.

</I>&gt;<i> won't be a problem unless you have both client and server sharing the
</I>&gt;<i> same Threadpool causing a deadlock.
</I>
That's not worse than the original (where the handshake was always
synchronous).

&gt;<i> I hope this helps and gets integrated.  It's definitely necessary for
</I>&gt;<i> our implementation.

1. I'll review the patch and, in doing so, check for possible binary
compatibility problems. I'm sure Carlos will do likewise;

2. I'll make public a new Mono.Security.dll assembly so that people that
depends on Ssl*Stream may tests it and report any problem/difference;

3. I'll run the regressions tests, the tools under /mcs/class/
Mono.Security/Test/tools/*, to see if it works in previously reported
conditions.

4. Commit (both the patch and your SocketHell tests). Hopefully we can
do all this before the next release.

Many thanks!
