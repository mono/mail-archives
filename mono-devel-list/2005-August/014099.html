<PRE>I have done &quot;make run-test&quot; on critical and some random assemblies but none
of them showed differences between 48518 and 48520. When you informed me
about regressions I did a &quot;make run-test&quot; comparsion on corlib again but I
did not get any differences.

&gt;<i> It was a copy-n-paste error. I fixed it in rev 48556.
</I>
Thanks for the fix. I think this error should occur in corlib tests but I
did not see it. I had more errors in results than on
<A HREF="http://mono.ximian.com/tests/displayTestResults.php">http://mono.ximian.com/tests/displayTestResults.php</A> so this may be the cause
because the relevant tests may failed in the unpatched version as well. And
I am sure that the tests were executed on Mono and I used the right
revisions.

BTW are there any other unfixed or fixed regressions?

Thanks for the explanations. I already knew most of these things but I have
never used buildbot. How can I use it? Are there any documentation about it?
The only think I know is that it is available on
<A HREF="http://mono.ximian.com:8008/.">http://mono.ximian.com:8008/.</A>

&gt;<i> Hello Kornel,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would appreciate if you could give me some hints and commands that help
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regression tracking.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's simple, just make sure you run &quot;make run-test&quot; for each assembly
</I>&gt;<i> that your patch will change. If there are errors then make sure that the
</I>&gt;<i> errors were already existing prior to committing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that this is not perfect as a change in assembly X could result in
</I>&gt;<i> problems in assembly Y (which would means that assembly X is missing
</I>&gt;<i> important unit tests) but it will catch most problems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally if, for any reason, you are unable to test the changes please
</I>&gt;<i> say so when sending the patch for review on the mailing-list. That way
</I>&gt;<i> someone else can test it before it gets committed (and yes that would
</I>&gt;<i> probably requires more time to approve the patch).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After committing a large patch (or a patch that can influence lots of
</I>&gt;<i> thing, e.g. many patches in corlib) you should also start buildbot
</I>&gt;<i> (which sadly seems offline at the moment). This will give you extra
</I>&gt;<i> insurance ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have never tested or compiled r48519 because it is the update of mcs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tree
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only. r48520 is the update of mono tree. If you use r48519 it may result
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> errors. I checked out mcs and mono separatedly and I was unable to make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> svn
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to commit them in a single command. If you know the solution please let
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It isn't a &quot;in between commits&quot; bug. The failures were still there this
</I>&gt;<i> morning (at revision 48555). I had to (a) go back to revision 48518 to
</I>&gt;<i> return to a normal (no failure) status and (b) try 48519 to ensure it
</I>&gt;<i> was this exact patch that caused the problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Unless I mistyped something the version patch should not have any effects
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that result in regressions because I did not (wanted to) modify code
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> behaviour.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It was a copy-n-paste error. I fixed it in rev 48556.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Could you please send me (or to the list if you want) some test results
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pointing out the regressions?
