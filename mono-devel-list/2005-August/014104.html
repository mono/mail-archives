<PRE>Hi Sebastien,

Ok, maybe the whole TLS cipher spec was a bit optimistic - hehe - just
reading up on some stuff now - I'll definetly try to do some of the DH
stuff though - some of the more common ones would be useful.

I've asked on the glftpd site about which ciphers they support -
otherwise I'm just going to have to force it to use the cipher I want
to test by removing all others from the cipher list.

I meant SSLClientStream and SSLServerStream - will be cool when we've
got SSLStream!

Sigh, I thought it wouldn't be good enough - bug in one, bug in the
other... don't want to give ourselves a false sense of security now do
we?!

Thanks for all the input, as I said, I'll have a blast at it some time
next week.

Martin

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry, I re-read the bit about DH....
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> np ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So basically, all I have to do is find the point in SSLStream where
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the negotiation completes and crypto objects are initialised and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instead of creating, say an RSA object, create a DH (and so on for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; selected cipher spec.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, you have to replace the part after the cipher selection and before

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Keep in mind that SslStream (2.0) doesn't work yet - but yes you can do
</I>&gt;<i> this in SslClientStream (and that code will eventually moves to the new
</I>&gt;<i> SslStream).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'll have a go on it next week when I have some time, thanks for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; info - I'd really like to extend the cipher suite to support
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; practically all the TLS cipher spec.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well I admit that DH would be nice but *all* ciphers may be too much
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. you don't want to mess up with the fortezza stuff ;-).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As for the testing, can I not create a hacked version of the Mono SSL
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Server Stream (can't remember it's name)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> SslServerStream
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which only supports the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cipher I want to test? Or is testing the Mono SSLClient against the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mono SSLServer not good enough - ie. do I need to test against an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; external component?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not good enough - at least for development as you risk having interop
</I>&gt;<i> problems (just like we had with client certificates).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Once both client and server are working with another implementation
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. openssl) you can use them, together, for regression testing (as
</I>&gt;<i> long as you don't make changes in both of them before testing).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ethereal is (or will be) your friend ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks again,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, thanks for the answer - I may well have a look at adding some of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; the ciphers when I get time...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; That would be nice :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I know that it is not a requirement to support all ciphers, but many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; servers that I am using also do not support all the ciphers - they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; seem to support all the ones Mono doesn't currently support - great
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; lol!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Mono supports the most common algorithms - at least from an HTTPS point
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; of view. What are those servers running (software and protocol) ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; The error produced is could not negotiate a cipher or something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; similar - which was &quot;fixed&quot; by adding a DH cipher to the list of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; support ciphers (when I say fixed I mean it got a stage further - so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; the exception was just unsupported ciphers.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Both normal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Negotiation is done by intersecting the list of ciphers available to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; both client and server and selecting (server) one of them. An alert is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; sent if the intersection is empty.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Adding something, like DH, to the client list results in a non-empty
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; intersection - but the client isn't capable to continue the handshake
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; because it doesn't support DH.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; When I said &quot;problem&quot; I meant the lack of support for, hence, is the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; lack of support due to DH in Mono not being implemented or merely that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; the SSLStream hasn't been tweaked to support DH?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I answered that...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * Mono.Security.dll supports DH (i.e. DH is present and working) so it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; isn't a cryptographic issue;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks again, it's a great class as it is - would be great if I could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; help add some ciphers!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; As I said it shouldn't too complex to add. It's even easier (test wise)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; if you have access to servers that only support algorithms not present
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; in Mono.
