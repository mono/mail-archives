<PRE>Mr Paolo,

I've demanded anything here?? 
Your message just showed the kind of person I'm dealing with. No need
for comments.

We'll continue in private and save the list from this things...

</I>&gt;<i>I'm not angry at microsoft, if you are, I suggest you keep your
</I>&gt;<i>complaints somewhere lese.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> very fond of it either. But, as it seems, when the market DO buy those

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you have to develop for that OS... There's no point in so much anger,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is there? This isn't ideological discussion. It's a fact!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If you want to sell a product, you're free to develop it and sell it.
</I>&gt;<i>What you're not free to do without looking like a *censored*, is to
</I>&gt;<i>demand that we develop the product for you. I'm not sure why you're so
</I>&gt;<i>upset about this, there is no ideology involved, just the plain fact
</I>&gt;<i>that I'm not interested in PocketPC: I have no use for such a device
</I>&gt;<i>if it doesn't run Linux. If it's useful for you, do something about it
</I>&gt;<i>instead of whining on the list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If people want to change this scenario, it's not only in the hands of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the tool developers, it's also in the hands of the application
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> developers. If they don't have an option, they choose for what they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> got... If when they get interested in alternatives, they got an answer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like yours.. Well... I'm glad this isn't always the case...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>You got it backwards: PocketPC is not the alternative, it is just a
</I>&gt;<i>different ring used to bound your nose. We are interested in the
</I>&gt;<i>alternative, and that is Linux on PDAs. If you're interested in mono
</I>&gt;<i>on PocketPC, write the code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Well... I feel honored that you give me permission to contribute or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *hire* someone to do it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>You don't need my permission, of course, I only mentioned it
</I>&gt;<i>because someone may not get it. And it looks like this is news for
</I>&gt;<i>you, so my suggestions was at least useful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Let me make one thing clear and straight: I didn't like your answer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Excellent, now why didn't you send a private email so that it can be
</I>&gt;<i>easily discarded instead of annoying all the people on the list?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> community, and that's it. I asked you a simple question, without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> offending anyone. If you can't control your idealisms and respect the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> others, well...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Dude, you're really frustrated, get a life.
</I>&gt;<i>I'm sorry if you thought that by subscribing to this list you're
</I>&gt;<i>entitled to a PocketPC port, a free dinner cooked directly at your home
</I>&gt;<i>or anything else you might have imagined. I'll see if we can change the
</I>&gt;<i>welcome message of the list to make it clearer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No further messages will be necessary in this thread. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>We're all relieved.
</I>&gt;<i>Thanks.
