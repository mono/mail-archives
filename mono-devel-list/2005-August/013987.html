I'm not sure adding a hook to re.emit is the right way to handle this.
First the hook would slow down it for a feature that is not used in
mono. Second, the metadata you'd get is likely not in a format you can
use.
What if you just recompile the assembly and develop an assembly diff
tool? In a few months the Cecil library may be able to allow this.

</I>
Me not being able to test the code means that the feedback loop with the
users of the code would be too long and not being able to use the code
takes away half the fun of writing it:-)

&gt;<i> Is there really no-one who uses Windows? Don't you care about windows

</I>
I hope you'll get help from the windows developers on the list so you
can complete your work.
Feel free to ask about any changes you'd need in the mono or mcs code,
though using an assembly diff tool might be your better bet anyway.
