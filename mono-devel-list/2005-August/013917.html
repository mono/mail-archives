<PRE>Anyone please?

Regarding the Atsushi Eno's comment about legality of using the 
Microsoft's metadata format: I do not think it is a problem since:
1) The specification is going to be released soon anyway
2) We do not really need it anyway - Mono's own format can be used.

David Srbecky

</I>&gt;<i>                           out deltaIL,           // Produced IL code
</I>&gt;<i>                           out deltaMetadata      // Changed metadata
</I>&gt;<i>                           );
</I>&gt;<i> // I send the deltas to the runtime

</I>&gt;<i> The deltaIL is really nothing more then just the IL code of the compiled
