<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt; Problem is that for RISC OS, they don't have dynamic linking support as yet
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (though the RISC OS gcc is getting there). There would also have to be a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different layer between SWF and the desktop as it's not running X.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Dynamic linking is not strictly required, mono uses it only for the
</I>&gt;<i> optional external profilers and p/invoke. And if the platform doesn't have
</I>&gt;<i> shared libraries p/invoke is not useful, so you have no excuses:-)
</I>
I thought that the binaries referenced the dll's rather than statically
included them. However, if the binaries can be statically linked, then
it's good.

&gt;<i> Anyway, I really know nothing about risc os, 
</I>
It's RISC OS (both are acronyms - you will find those in or from the
RISC OS community somewhat precious about the naming of it!)

&gt;<i> I just know it still exists
</I>&gt;<i> since it's installed in my arm box, so I though someone out there
</I>&gt;<i> was still using it.
</I>
About half a million users left.

I may be able to put a research proposal together to get a new RISC OS
box at work (I'm at the University of Salford), but I would need a
sponsor - say from Novell and a definite purpose for doing the work.
Now, I can argue that I want support for one I'm putting together now
(see <A HREF="http://www.all-the-johnsons.co.uk/chemical">http://www.all-the-johnsons.co.uk/chemical</A> ) but I would need
backing up. Anyone fancy adding weight - not sure if there is a
financial element, but if there is, it'll be buttons.

TTFN

Paul
