That would be nice :)

Mono supports the most common algorithms - at least from an HTTPS point
of view. What are those servers running (software and protocol) ?

&gt;<i> The error produced is could not negotiate a cipher or something

</I>
Both normal. 

Negotiation is done by intersecting the list of ciphers available to
both client and server and selecting (server) one of them. An alert is
sent if the intersection is empty.

Adding something, like DH, to the client list results in a non-empty
intersection - but the client isn't capable to continue the handshake
because it doesn't support DH.

&gt;<i> When I said &quot;problem&quot; I meant the lack of support for, hence, is the
</I>&gt;<i> lack of support due to DH in Mono not being implemented or merely that
</I>&gt;<i> the SSLStream hasn't been tweaked to support DH?
</I>
I answered that...
&gt;<i> &gt; * Mono.Security.dll supports DH (i.e. DH is present and working) so it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; isn't a cryptographic issue;
</I>
&gt;<i> Thanks again, it's a great class as it is - would be great if I could
</I>&gt;<i> help add some ciphers!
</I>
As I said it shouldn't too complex to add. It's even easier (test wise)
if you have access to servers that only support algorithms not present
in Mono.
