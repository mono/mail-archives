<PRE>I took the plunge and fully implemented async Ssl streams for both client and server.  This fixes <A HREF="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=75687">http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=75687</A> as well as other bugs I've been talking with Sebastien and Carlos about off list. This patch passes the SocketHell tests that I contributed to them last week (multi threaded concurrent async streaming through TCP sockets).

It's also a bit of a re-factor, though I only touched two classes and added one.  I pulled most of the code out of the individual SslClientStream and SslServerStream and moved it down into a new abstract SslStreamBase.  Client and server are now practically the same implementation.  I left all existing interfaces present, but obviously had to add some new ones.

The only &quot;gotcha&quot; is if you start running low on threadpool threads. Then the Ssl Stream will fall back to a synchronous handshake. The other option here is to spawn a thread ourselves for the handshake instead of using Delegate.BeginInvoke(), use the IO ThreadPool (is that available to Mono.Security?), or just live with a synchronous handshake. Of course, 99.999% of the time this issue won't occur and won't be a problem unless you have both client and server sharing the same Threadpool causing a deadlock.

I hope this helps and gets integrated.  It's definitely necessary for our implementation.
