<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; I was wondering if there was any synchronization between
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Novell.Directory.Ldap on Novell forge and Mono. I have noticed that
</I>the
&gt;<i> &gt; trees are currently fairly different. I'm trying to make a decision
</I>on
&gt;<i> &gt; which to patch, but I don't really know. I am leaning toward
</I>patching
&gt;<i> &gt; the one on Novell forge since that seems to be the root, but then
</I>when,
&gt;<i> &gt; if ever, would my fixes show up in the Mono tree? Would I be stuck
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; building my own version of Novell.Directory.Ldap for distribution?
</I>Is
&gt;<i> &gt; there any particular reason why I should modify the one in the Mono
</I>tree
&gt;<i> &gt; vs. the one in Novell Forge?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would you be interested in merging the changes from the official
</I>Novell
&gt;<i> build into our tree?
</I>
That's certainly a possibility, but I wouldn't want to do it if it was
something that was going to have to be maintained in separate branches
going into the future. There really should be only one branch, maybe
with separate build scripts and some defines for Mono's TARGET_JVM and
anything else that's needed.
