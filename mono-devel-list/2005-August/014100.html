<PRE>Hi Sebastien,

The servers that are causing me the most problems are glftpd servers,
which have a proprietary SSL implementation that is not open source.
Seems to be no intersect between their ciphers and monos on many
setups.

Sorry, I re-read the bit about DH....

So basically, all I have to do is find the point in SSLStream where
the negotiation completes and crypto objects are initialised and
instead of creating, say an RSA object, create a DH (and so on for the
selected cipher spec.)

I'll have a go on it next week when I have some time, thanks for the
info - I'd really like to extend the cipher suite to support
practically all the TLS cipher spec.

As for the testing, can I not create a hacked version of the Mono SSL
Server Stream (can't remember it's name) which only supports the
cipher I want to test? Or is testing the Mono SSLClient against the
Mono SSLServer not good enough - ie. do I need to test against an
external component?

Thanks again,

Martin

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; * Mono.Security.dll supports DH (i.e. DH is present and working) so it

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks again, it's a great class as it is - would be great if I could

</I>&gt;<i> As I said it shouldn't too complex to add. It's even easier (test wise)
