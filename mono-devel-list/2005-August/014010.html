I meant in the last structure quoted, RegionLCIDMap. It seems to map
from a locale id to a region index. If you include the region index into
the CultureInfoEntry you save the duplicated lcid fields.

&gt;<i> &gt;This looks wrong: CurrentRegion sounds like a per-thread value and you're 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;a static var which is per-domain. Also, even if using a simple static var 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the right thing, the lock is not needed: the worse that can happe is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;that we create two identical objects and one gets collected by the GC.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I also guessed so at first, but there seems no CurrentRegion inside
</I>&gt;<i> a thread unlike CurrentCulture.
</I>
Not sure what you mean: the MS documentation is very confused as usual,
but it mentions it's per thread.

&gt;<i> Based on the assumption that CurrentRegion is instantiated per-domain,
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not understanding that one is likely to be collected by the GC
</I>&gt;<i> (well, one could be collected in another domain, but it does not
</I>&gt;<i> sound problematic). I think that without the lock CurrentRegion could
</I>&gt;<i> be different instance in the same domain in a race condition.
</I>
If you hit the race, the worse that can happen is that two equivalent region
objects are created and they are both stored in the static var: the last
one will be kept alive and the first one will be collected by the GC.
So there is no issue that needs locking here, IMHO.
