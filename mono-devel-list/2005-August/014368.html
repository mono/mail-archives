<PRE>Hi,

 

I've got some problems with building the package in a cygwin environment.
The first Problem I ran into is that one must de-install the glib-2.0-devel
package. That package includes the .pc files for the pkg-config which are
needed to find the glib-2.0 lib files during the configure process. I solved
the problem by saving the .pc files before removing the -devel package and
then copying them back afterwards. Of course I don't know if that is the
intention of the process :-)

The next problem I have is with the cygwin version of sed 4.1.4-1. When
making the Makefiles I get following error message:

 

config.status: creating Makefile

sed: file ./confstatJS1528/subs-5.sed line 6: unterminated `s' command

config.status: creating mint.pc

sed: file ./confstatJS1528/subs-5.sed line 6: unterminated `s' command

config.status: creating mono.pc

sed: file ./confstatJS1528/subs-5.sed line 6: unterminated `s' command

config.status: creating mono-uninstalled.pc

sed: file ./confstatJS1528/subs-5.sed line 6: unterminated `s' command

config.status: creating scripts/mono-nunit.pc

sed: file ./confstatJS1528/subs-5.sed line 6: unterminated `s' command

config.status: creating scripts/mono-find-provides

sed: file ./confstatJS1528/subs-5.sed line 6: unterminated `s' command

config.status: creating scripts/mono-find-requires

sed: file ./confstatJS1528/subs-5.sed line 6: unterminated `s' command

config.status: creating mono/Makefile

sed: file ./confstatJS1528/subs-5.sed line 6: unterminated `s' command

config.status: creating mono/utils/Makefile

sed: file ./confstatJS1528/subs-5.sed line 6: unterminated `s' command

config.status: creating mono/metadata/Makefile

 

With the result that Makesfiles are empty (0 Bytes)

 

Does anyone have some ideas? I took a fresh copy from the svn repository.

 

Thanks for any ideas,

 

Eduard Ralph
