<PRE>Hello Kornel,

Try doing &quot;svn up -r 48518&quot; then a &quot;make run-test&quot; under corlib.
After that try the same thing but for revision 45819.

If you're using cygwin then make sure that the unit tests are executed
using Mono and not the MS runtime.

It's simple, just make sure you run &quot;make run-test&quot; for each assembly
that your patch will change. If there are errors then make sure that the
errors were already existing prior to committing.

Note that this is not perfect as a change in assembly X could result in
problems in assembly Y (which would means that assembly X is missing
important unit tests) but it will catch most problems.

Finally if, for any reason, you are unable to test the changes please
say so when sending the patch for review on the mailing-list. That way
someone else can test it before it gets committed (and yes that would
probably requires more time to approve the patch).

After committing a large patch (or a patch that can influence lots of
thing, e.g. many patches in corlib) you should also start buildbot
(which sadly seems offline at the moment). This will give you extra
insurance ;-)

&gt;<i> I have never tested or compiled r48519 because it is the update of mcs tree
</I>&gt;<i> only. r48520 is the update of mono tree. If you use r48519 it may result in

</I>&gt;<i> know.
</I>
It isn't a &quot;in between commits&quot; bug. The failures were still there this
morning (at revision 48555). I had to (a) go back to revision 48518 to
return to a normal (no failure) status and (b) try 48519 to ensure it
was this exact patch that caused the problem.

&gt;<i> Unless I mistyped something the version patch should not have any effects
</I>&gt;<i> that result in regressions because I did not (wanted to) modify code
</I>&gt;<i> behaviour.
</I>
It was a copy-n-paste error. I fixed it in rev 48556.

&gt;<i> Could you please send me (or to the list if you want) some test results
</I>&gt;<i> pointing out the regressions?
</I>
