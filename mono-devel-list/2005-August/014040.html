Gomes va escriure: 
&gt;<i> I've been looking into completion lately and I've a few questions,
</I>&gt;<i> comments and suggestions to do.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First thing to say is that I don't like the &quot;new concept&quot; of having
</I>&gt;<i> completion window under MonoDevelop.Base.Gui. I do believe that is
</I>&gt;<i> specific to the source editor widget.
</I>
It is not. Code completion will be useful in other contexts, completely
unrelated to the SourceEditor. For example, when adding an expression
watch to the debugger watch window.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Secondly, there is a lot of logic code inside the Source Editor; That's
</I>&gt;<i> bad! We are doing 2 things wrong in this topic, we are doing
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;C#-parsing&quot; and we are processing the completion there too
</I>
The parsing is done by the ParserService, not by the Source Editor.

&gt;<i>  - I had no
</I>&gt;<i> time to check, 
</I>
You should check what are you talking about, before posting suggestions
on it.

&gt;<i> but I suppose boo, vb.net and other completion is done
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere else, where?
</I>
Language addin can provide IParser implementations, which are used by
the parser service to parse files.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is that there isn't anything better to know what and when to
</I>&gt;<i> show the help the user needs than the Language Binding itself.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, here is my suggestion:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. There should be a kind of SourceEditor Specification that states that
</I>&gt;<i> it should be able to show completion windows, insight-window and even
</I>&gt;<i> other 'tooltips'.
</I>
What is a &quot;SourceEditor Specification&quot;? A set of interfaces to be
implemented? Please be more specific.

MD is based on services. A text editor is free to use any service it
wants to do its job. Code completion is just another service.

&gt;<i> 2. SourceEditor should be associated with a LanguageBinding and
</I>&gt;<i> interactively notify the LanguageBinding about current &quot;iter&quot;/caret
</I>&gt;<i> position
</I>
The SourceEditor already has this kind of relation with the
ParserService.

&gt;<i> 3. Based on that data the LanguageBinding can tell the Source Editor to
</I>&gt;<i> show &quot;these completion options&quot; or &quot;this insight window&quot;, etc...
</I>
The logic for determining when to show the completion window is right
now in the editor. And I agree with you in this point, it should be
somewhere else (but definitely, not in LanguageBinding).

&gt;<i> 4. When the context is made invalid, LanguageBinding tell Source Editor
</I>&gt;<i> to hide the completion/... windows
</I>&gt;<i> Using this work-flow we win several things:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Better support to implement completion-information for new languages
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Better abstraction enabling third-party Source Editor or, even,
</I>&gt;<i> Completion Window, etc...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. New helper &quot;tools&quot;, examples for C#:
</I>&gt;<i> * &quot;Press TAB to implement event/interface/abstract class&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> * Refactoring and Templates
</I>&gt;<i> * &quot;Goto Definition&quot;
</I>
This is completely unrelated to code completion.

&gt;<i> * See only fit-able properties/methods for that method param/assign (ex:
</I>&gt;<i> foo (int a) would only show methods/properties/fields that return int
</I>&gt;<i> when completion opens in 'foo (')
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't believe the current Language Binding can support that now and in
</I>&gt;<i> a easy way. Maybe we need a new class to do that?
</I>
Just to be a bit more concrete: what we need is a class that the editor
can use to take a decision about when to show the code completion
window.

It would be awesome if you can provide a patch for this. Thanks!
Lluis.
