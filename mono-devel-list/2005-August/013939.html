<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm building
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code that needs to run under both frameworks and right now I'm
</I>deciding
&gt;<i> &gt; between updating Mono or writing my own SslStream based on
</I>Mono.Security
&gt;<i> &gt; and using #if defs (I'd rather do the former).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mono.Security.dll already contains SslClientStream and SslServerStream
</I>&gt;<i> classes (which were based on the MS Fx 1.2 preview API) and was done
</I>by
&gt;<i> Carlos (and a few bits by me). There are a few known bugs (mostly
</I>&gt;<i> related to async support) but they are working, including support for
</I>&gt;<i> client, server, SSL3, TLS1, client-side certificates ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Using them would be easier it you want SSL support on both framework
</I>(as
&gt;<i> Mono.Security.dll doesn't depend on anything Mono specific) including
</I>&gt;<i> 1.x versions. Unless you are requiring something special/specific wrt
</I>&gt;<i> SSL ?
</I>
I will have a look at Mono.Security.  Right now the code base is
compiling (and mostly working) on both the MS.Net 2.0 Beta 2 and Mono
1.1.8 2.0 libraries.  Tls is one of the few remaining sticking points.
I don't need anything special.

After I sent the original email I went ahead and ifdef'd for Mono's Beta
1 style representation of the SslStream and related naming.  I got some
NotImplementedException's on the SslStream.ClientAuthenticate that says
100% implemented with no TODO in HEAD (haven't looked into it yet).
Hopefully it's been added since 1.1.8 release I'm running with.
