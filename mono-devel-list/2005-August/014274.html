<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> We had asked the same answer before when we had fixes for Novell.Directory.Ldap. What
</I>&gt;<i> is the official answer? How do we maintain sync with the Novel sources?
</I>
This seems to be getting worse.

Novell.Ldap is a namespace that was contributed to us by the EDirectory
group, and since the original landing of the code, we have obtained a
few refreshes from them.

The refreshes are fairly sporadic, we barely are notified of them, and
the developers on that group do not seem to be tracking Mono at all.

So we have a problem in our hands.

Maybe we need to take the problem into our hands, and do the manual
merging from the forge repository into our repository ourselves.  

It just feels like a massive drag, I had hoped that we did not need to
divert too much from them.

Suggestions as to how to proceed are welcome.

Miguel.
