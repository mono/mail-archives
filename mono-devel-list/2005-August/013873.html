I didn't say that, of course.

Maybe you're projecting? Are you frustrated because you bought a
PocketPC brick? If you can't deal with the technical meaning of
usefulness in the context of mono, this list is not for you.
I'm not angry at microsoft, if you are, I suggest you keep your
complaints somewhere lese.

&gt;<i> very fond of it either. But, as it seems, when the market DO buy those
</I>&gt;<i> PDAs, and when people ONLY use them, if you want to sell a product,
</I>&gt;<i> you have to develop for that OS... There's no point in so much anger,
</I>&gt;<i> is there? This isn't ideological discussion. It's a fact!
</I>
If you want to sell a product, you're free to develop it and sell it.
What you're not free to do without looking like a *censored*, is to
demand that we develop the product for you. I'm not sure why you're so
upset about this, there is no ideology involved, just the plain fact
that I'm not interested in PocketPC: I have no use for such a device
if it doesn't run Linux. If it's useful for you, do something about it
instead of whining on the list.

&gt;<i> If people want to change this scenario, it's not only in the hands of
</I>&gt;<i> the tool developers, it's also in the hands of the application
</I>&gt;<i> developers. If they don't have an option, they choose for what they
</I>&gt;<i> got... If when they get interested in alternatives, they got an answer
</I>&gt;<i> like yours.. Well... I'm glad this isn't always the case...
</I>
You got it backwards: PocketPC is not the alternative, it is just a
different ring used to bound your nose. We are interested in the
alternative, and that is Linux on PDAs. If you're interested in mono
on PocketPC, write the code.

&gt;<i> Well... I feel honored that you give me permission to contribute or
</I>&gt;<i> *hire* someone to do it.
</I>
You don't need my permission, of course, I only mentioned it
because someone may not get it. And it looks like this is news for
you, so my suggestions was at least useful.

&gt;<i> Let me make one thing clear and straight: I didn't like your answer.
</I>
Excellent, now why didn't you send a private email so that it can be
easily discarded instead of annoying all the people on the list?

&gt;<i> community, and that's it. I asked you a simple question, without
</I>&gt;<i> offending anyone. If you can't control your idealisms and respect the
</I>&gt;<i> others, well...
</I>
Dude, you're really frustrated, get a life.
I'm sorry if you thought that by subscribing to this list you're
entitled to a PocketPC port, a free dinner cooked directly at your home
or anything else you might have imagined. I'll see if we can change the
welcome message of the list to make it clearer.

&gt;<i> No further messages will be necessary in this thread. 
</I>
We're all relieved.
Thanks.
