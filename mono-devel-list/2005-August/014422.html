<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I tried your patch with ComIStreamMarshaler.cs and used -codepage:65001. It
</I>&gt;<i> worked as expected but it fails with SVN head. The expected behaviour is to
</I>&gt;<i> compile without errors so you patch solves the bug.
</I>
Yep - now the fixed patch is going.

&gt;<i> I've done some tests with files readed as UTF-8 but containing invalid byte
</I>&gt;<i> sequences even with BOM and it worked as expected.
</I>
Cool. Thanks for checking it :-)

&gt;<i> I think the patch should be ported to gmcs as well.
</I>
I'll ask Martin later.

&gt;<i> I think we should return using Encoding.Default as the default encoding in
</I>&gt;<i> mcs but should comfigure mcs using -codepage:28591 -codepage:1252 in
</I>&gt;<i> mcs/build to use that encoding.
</I>
Maybe after 1.1.9 as Miguel suggested? I don't think the default
encoding problem would happen only to mcs.
