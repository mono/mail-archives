<PRE>I have a feeling I should send this in separate posts, but they are all
quick..  New to the .Net to Mono migration so please humor any dumb
newbie stuff..

a) I've correctly or incorrectly reported a bug regarding the path and
user controls with Server.Transfer.
<A HREF="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=75550">http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=75550</A>

Point me in the right direction and I'll see if I can create a patch

b) Looking for a good/easy to install Forum software (that will work
under Mono)  This is the best candidate I've found so far
(<A HREF="http://www.yetanotherforum.net/">http://www.yetanotherforum.net/</A>) Progress or lack thereof can be seen
here (<A HREF="http://www.themp3pool.com/forum/">http://www.themp3pool.com/forum/</A>)
    a. My first error seems to be looking for Kernel32.dll.  (Umm..
Anyone got the source to this file so I can put it in my mono/1.0
directory ;)

System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException: Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation. ---&gt; System.DllNotFoundException: Kernel32.dll
in (wrapper managed-to-native) yaf.classes.HiPerfTimer:QueryPerformanceFrequency (long&amp;)
in &lt;0x00036&gt; yaf.classes.HiPerfTimer:.ctor (Boolean bStart)

I think I remember seeing something in the dev list about QueryPerformanceFrequency.. Is this a matter of recompiling yaf.dll under mono or removing the offending code?

c) Cookieless session tracking implementation between MS .Net and Mono is different... (Not throughly tested.. please excuse any inaccuracies)
	a. The URL is being rewritten, but so are all other links and paths to images...  The correct method should only rewrite the href inside the &lt;a&gt; tag. (With a caveat*)
	Additionally, it didn't actually seem to be tracking the session, but just rewriting the URL with each POST/GET. Is this known.. Once again I'm interested in seeing if I can submit a patch. (Where should I look.)
	The caveat to this is that under MS .Net I have found that sometimes the href is NOT* rewritten.  (bug or data control issue I'm not sure and I'd have to try to procure the code.)  At this point just an observation.
	Lastly, the current implementation causes serious havoc on reverse proxies and Mono.. (Each page and all the images on the page appear to be loading/compiling again for the first time. Also messing with output caching ect..)

*** Slightly off list main topic, but mentioned recently ***
d) I have an HP ipaq h6315 (PDA phone) dabian arm project current status has it has non-bootable..  I've been HIGHLY interested in changing the OS, but from what I've found
I need a serial cable connection to do this and to modify a data cord..  (I own a Dell laptop and doesn't have a serial.. So I need the USB to serial converter 20USD, but I'm in eastern
Europe at the moment and can't get it sent here easily.  I've considered building, but I'm not that interested/can't find the parts.. specifically the ICs.
The big question is.. can anyone give some tips on how to setup my cross chain toolkit and use USB... kernel does recognize the device and I can transfer data to it, but haven't fiddled with it so much.
