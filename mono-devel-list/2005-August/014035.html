<PRE>Hello,

The hack you proposed doesn't work because in general, there is no one
to one mapping between .jvm files and regular mono files. You can see
for instance System.Data.dll where the java connected mode is completely
different than the mono one.

The problem with separate source files per profile is the redundancy :
when someone adds a file he needs to add it to several .sources.
One way to handle with this problem is to add an &quot;include&quot; feature in
the .sources files. But the price to pay (if we don't want redundancy)
is the multiplication of files. For instance let's suppose that :
1) net_1_1 needs A and B
2) net_2_2 needs A, B and C
3) java_net_1_1 needs A and D

We need to have four files :

common.sources contains :
A

net_1_1.sources :
#include common
B

net_2_0.sources:
#includes net_1_1
C

java_net_1_1.sources:
#includes common
D

The xml file Ynon proposed was only the reunion of all these file.

In summary, we have at least the following possibilities :

1) Use on .sources file only and enclose the content of each file not
used by _every_ profile by #ifdef.
Advantages: Only one single .sources
Disadvantages: A lot of #ifdefs in a large part of the files.

2) Use one .sources per profile with redundancy.
Advantages: clear separation between each profile.
Disadvantages: Needs to syncronize manually between profiles each time a
new file is added (or a file is removed).

3) Use one file per profile using includes.
Advantages: can use  sort | uniq operations.  Simple format.
Disadvantages: more files that the # of profiles if we don't want
duplicates.

4) Use one xml file containing the whole information
Advantages: one single and simple file containg all the information.
Disadvantages: XML is overkill ; cannot use sort | uniq like operations

5) Use a single in another format (.ini file for instance).
Advantages: the same as 4)
Disadvantages: cannot use sort | uniq like operations.

What do you think ?

Thanks,

--yas
