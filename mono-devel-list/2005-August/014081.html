&gt;<i> The problem with separate source files per profile is the redundancy :

</I>&gt;<i> One way to handle with this problem is to add an &quot;include&quot; feature in
</I>&gt;<i> the .sources files. But the price to pay (if we don't want redundancy)
</I>&gt;<i> is the multiplication of files. For instance let's suppose that :
</I>[snip]

&gt;<i> 1) Use on .sources file only and enclose the content of each file not
</I>&gt;<i> used by _every_ profile by #ifdef.
</I>&gt;<i> Advantages: Only one single .sources
</I>&gt;<i> Disadvantages: A lot of #ifdefs in a large part of the files.
</I>
The current approach.  I don't see the #ifdef as being a problem, since
it encloses the whole file, and is otherwise reasonably unobstrusive.

&gt;<i> 2) Use one .sources per profile with redundancy.
</I>&gt;<i> Advantages: clear separation between each profile.
</I>&gt;<i> Disadvantages: Needs to syncronize manually between profiles each time a
</I>&gt;<i> new file is added (or a file is removed).
</I>
Yep.  Not a good idea.

&gt;<i> 3) Use one file per profile using includes.
</I>&gt;<i> Advantages: can use  sort | uniq operations.  Simple format.
</I>&gt;<i> Disadvantages: more files that the # of profiles if we don't want
</I>&gt;<i> duplicates.
</I>
No need for includes.  We can do a hybrid approach.  The usual

  foo.dll.sources

file has all the sources that are common to all profiles.  Sources that
belong to only one profile (say net_2_0) will be listed in

  foo.dll.net_2_0.sources

Sources that belong to multiple profiles (but not all) will be listed in
the common foo.dll.sources file, and the actual source files will have
#ifdef guards.

In all, however, I feel the current approach is quite nice, since it
documents, in the source file itself, which API is being used in that
file.  My only reason for contemplating per-profile additional response
files is to make build dependencies more precise.
