<PRE>Hi,

This patch is quite big. The 2.0.0.0 patch was much smaller but you wanted
this bigger one.:) It may be more difficult to review but will result in a
much reliable class library.

It contains only assembly version related things nothing else. Note that I
corrected all the version issues I found in any file type. For example:
v2.0.40607 -&gt; v2.0.50215 (config)
1:0:33000:0 -&gt; 1:0:3300:0 (comment)
1.0.3102.0 -&gt; 1.0.3300.0 (resx)

I did not modify any InformationalVersion or FileVersion attributes but they
should be modified at a later time.

I did not modified tests to use the common Consts.cs because they are
designed differently but I updated the version numbers to 2.0.0.0.

I did not added any ChangeLog entry and I'm not going to do it by hand. If
you want to have ChangeLog entries please let me know how can I generate
them.

To Ben:
&gt;<i>I am sick of explaining that this task is in fact quite easy.
</I>
The idea behind this task is easy to understand but actually it took a lot
of hours to create this patch as all the results has to be examined even
with regular expressions matching only the right version numbers.
