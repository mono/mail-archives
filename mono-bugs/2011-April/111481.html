--- Comment #4 from Sebastien Pouliot &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-bugs">spouliot at novell.com</A>&gt; 2011-04-28 00:50:28 UTC ---
It's hard to provide a concise yet complete answer. Beside the actual
explanation it would needs some comparisons and a few examples. Which leads to
more questions (like splitting rules) needing more answers, comparisons,
examples... to the point where the original question is often forgotten ;-)

So the short answer is &quot;what's being ignored (or suppressed) are defects - not
code&quot;. That's true for Gendarme and AFAIK it's also the same for FxCop.

If this is too short an answer then you're welcome to bring the issue to the
mailing-list for further discussion, i.e. a longer answer(s), since bug reports
are not a good place to store them (and this could interest other people, now
or in the future).
