           Summary: IgnoreList is not being appropriately handled when a
                    rule is run against a type, when the rule enumerates
                    the types members (for instance,
                    AvoidSpeculativeGenerality)
    Classification: Mono
           Product: Mono: Tools
           Version: 2.10.x
          Platform: 64bit
        OS/Version: Windows 7
            Status: NEW
          Severity: Normal
          Priority: P5 - None

See test case here:
<A HREF="https://github.com/Iristyle/mono-tools/commit/8469e3a4034cb1f1815cd67a505338cf75a179c7">https://github.com/Iristyle/mono-tools/commit/8469e3a4034cb1f1815cd67a505338cf75a179c7</A>

I have populated the Runner's IgnoreList in roughly the same manner as
SuppressMessageEngine would -- that is, by MetadataToken -- to simulate the
issue.  When the rule is run against the type in question, only the type is
examined for rule suppressions.  However, the rule itself enumerates methods of
the class but does not check the IgnoreList for those methods in any way during
the process.  So even though the type has only 1 method, which should be
ignored, the rule generates a failure on the given type. 

There may be other rules that operate in this fashion.


In my production code, I can further verify the test assumptions by applying
the [SuppressMessage] at the class level, and watching the failure disappear.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Run linked test
2.
3.
Actual Results:  
Failure

Expected Results:  
DoesNotApply
