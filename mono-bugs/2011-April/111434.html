--- Comment #3 from Ethan Brown &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-bugs">ethan_j_brown at hotmail.com</A>&gt; 2011-04-26 14:52:24 UTC ---
I entirely understand your rationale.  However, this rule does use individual
methods as a basis for making its determination as you know -- 

i.e. MostlyMethodsDelegatesCall 

<A HREF="https://github.com/mono/mono-tools/blob/master/gendarme/rules/Gendarme.Rules.Smells/AvoidSpeculativeGeneralityRule.cs">https://github.com/mono/mono-tools/blob/master/gendarme/rules/Gendarme.Rules.Smells/AvoidSpeculativeGeneralityRule.cs</A>


Imagine a class with a whole bunch of methods, something like this pseudo-code:

class MyClass
{

[SuppressMessage()]
public void IntentionallySpeculative() {}

public void Foo() {}

public void UnintentionallySpeculative() {}

}

So let's say the original author is OK with method IntentionallySpeculative...
that's by design.  Assume UnintentionallySpeculative is something accidental. 
Maybe it's a code change made by a different author.


If the original author applied the [SuppressMessage] on the class, any
additional speculative methods would be hidden in future code changes --
they're masked.  

So I feel like applying at a class level for my scenario is the inappropriate
level of abstraction.


Perhaps there are 2 rules here.  If AvoidSpeculativeGenerality could be split
into a method level rule to handle my scenario vs a type level rule to handle
the 'abstract class without responsiblity' type issues, that would solve the
problem.

Does that make sense?
