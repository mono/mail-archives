&gt;<i> Not sure I get completely the idea of how to fix this enhancement with
</I>post-processing tools

Simply put: runners takes assemblies and return a defect list [1]

If additional inputs helps to reduce/simplify the analysis then it's a great
runner feature. Ignore-list is such a case because it can avoid code analysis
since we know we'll ignore its result.

i.e. running rule X on code Y, leading to known defects, which means
allocations, not a simple DoesNotApply... that saves time/memory


In contrast options that requires extra conditions to occurs before rules are
executed are *very* costly. 

E.g. an extra check to call IRule::Check* methods would be called millions of
time on Mono class libraries. Since most rules will return quickly
(DoesNotApply) then the extra check needs to be ***very*** cheap not to affect
performance.

In fact it's often [2] quicker to get defects (even several thousands) then
post-process them (with the extra logic) than applying it on the millions
Assemblies/Types/Methods.

Now consider that each new idea is a (or several) new check(s), that only some
Gendarme users will need, or need only some time...


[1] various formats (but that's something that could be post-processed, anyway
reporting occurs after the analysis)

[2] *often* is for people that will use the feature since it's always quicker
for people that do not require it ;-)



p.s. please do not undo previous bug (description) changes :)
