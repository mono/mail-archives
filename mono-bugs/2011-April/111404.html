--- Comment #2 from Sebastien Pouliot &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-bugs">spouliot at novell.com</A>&gt; 2011-04-26 01:59:53 UTC ---
While some cases are likely bad* this one, AvoidSpeculativeGeneralityRule, 
is correct since we're looking at a ITypeRule reporting a defect on the (same)
'type' instance that is being analyzed**. 

The way to ignore this is specify the type, the namespace or the assembly.

* If you have other examples please let me know.

** I'm not closing the bug yet as I want to review the case where an IType rule
iterates on methods and report defect on them. It's uncommon but there are
cases where it make sense (e.g. checking methods based on a interface).
