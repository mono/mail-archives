 I am not sure who is throwing &quot;Unhandled Exception&quot; or why mod-mono-server
 does not continue exit after it is thrown.  The main runner thread (the
 only non-background thread) appears to have been aborted successfully.
 
 I know this is complex, but we are excited to be at this performance point
 with Mono.

+------- Additional Comments From <A HREF="mailto:gonzalo@ximian.com">gonzalo@ximian.com</A>  2005-03-11 20:01 -------
+&gt;we have a busy server (with 200 clients) the first roll of Apache 
+&gt;(killall-HUP httpd2-worker) usually works, but the second usually 
+&gt; fails.  on the second roll mod-mono-server throws:
+
+&gt;Unhandled Exception: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference 
+&gt;not set to an instance of an object
+
+&gt;which we see in the error_log file. I have been unable to determine 
+&gt;who is throwing this exception, but at this point mod-mono-server 
+&gt;fails to exit.
+
+I'll try to reproduce this condition by running mod-mono-server under
+gdb (slow) and pausing when we're told to shutdown. Let's see if i get
+the nullref.
+
+&gt; because of the hash lock file, it will not be started again.
+
+I can remove this lock file and the socket file immediately after
+receiving the shutdown request, before finalizing the applications
+running.
+
+&gt; for robustness, I think we should start by tightenting the starting 
+&gt; of mod-mono-server using a lock file or mutex in mod_mono and remove
+&gt; the hash lock in the mod-mono-server.
+
+The problem of locking in mod_mono is that mod-mono-server can be run
+from outside mod_mono. Having the lock in mod-mono-server prevents
+user errors if attempting to run the same thing twice (and if we
+remove the lock immediately we'll have better chances here).
+
+On the other hand, not locking in mod_mono causes forking overhead at
+startup.
+
+
+ I think we need to support starting a new mod-mono-server comming up
+even if the old mod-mono-server has become defunct (or possible force
+a kill before starting again).
+
+&gt;Q: how do you see the WebTracing in mod-mono-server, when running
+mod_mono?
+You have to compile with /d:WEBTRACE. The output goes to Console.Out,
+so you have to put that dup2() line in mod_mono when forking.
+
+ where does the output from mod-mono-server behind mod_mono go?
+
+stdout goes to apache stdout, which i think it's ignored. stderr goes
+to the error log.
+
+&gt; I am not sure who is throwing &quot;Unhandled Exception&quot; or why 
+&gt; mod-mono-server does not continue exit after it is thrown.  The main
+&gt; runner thread (the only non-background thread) appears to have been 
+&gt; aborted successfully.
+
+I don't know if i'll be able to reproduce this inside or outside gdb,
+but i'll try.
+
+One question for you: is this using SVN mono/mcs/xsp/mod_mono?
+
+&gt; I know this is complex, but we are excited to be at this performance
+&gt; point with Mono.
+
+I'm glad to hear this and part of the &quot;blame&quot; is on you guys.
