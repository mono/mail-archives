<PRE>Hi,

recently I got mono compiled+linked+running with the configuration
described above.

I would like to share my experiences,
mainly so that my next mono installation on that platform
will be a little smoother ;-)

I started with this:

    ./configure --prefix=$PREFIX --with-libiconv=gnu --with-icu=yes

At one stage the build process (&quot;make&quot;) tried to use an &quot;mcs&quot;,
assumed to be already installed from a previous installation.
But there wasn't a previous installation,
but instead there was a pretty different &quot;mcs&quot; within /usr/ccs/bin.
To avoid getting that one used,
my next executions of &quot;make&quot; got an &quot;env PATH=.....&quot; &quot;prepended&quot;,
where /usr/ccs/bin got excluded from my PATH for the time being.
Maybe now, that the developers of mono know of this little problem,
they are kind enough to find a way around.

A little later the build process failed in the context of &quot;jay&quot;.

I had to a the following line in mcs/build/config.make :

    CC = gcc

as otherwise make insisted in exactly that context on using &quot;cc&quot; instead,
which is a bad idea on our machine.
For later use during &quot;make install&quot; I had to add in the same file this entry:

    INSTALL= $(prefix)/bin/install

as otherwise make would insist on using /usr/bin/install instead,
which we don't have either.

Once I got &quot;make&quot; completed, I tried a &quot;make check&quot;.
Well, the 28 or so regression test errors frustrated me a little,
but I decided not to worry about them for the time being.

With the line mentioned above, &quot;make install&quot; did an almost proper job.
&quot;Almost&quot; because apparently it wasn't really perfect,
as mcs and mono decided to start up properly only,
if they find my MONO_PATH env. variable with this value:

    $prefix/lib/mono/1.0:$prefix/lib/mono/2.0

Honestly! If I unset that env. variable, I get an error message like this
(and after that, everything would stop):

    GLib: Cannot convert message: Conversion ... not supported




Obviously I managed this time to overcome all these obstacles,
and presumably my upgrade in a couple of weeks will cost me a couple of
hours less, but still ...

Feedback appreciated.
I am quite willing to try a couple of patches and retry the build process
again.

I do not have subversion installed here,
and as we live behind a firewall here,
&quot;svn+ssh&quot; is not the option to go.
(Yes, I know, there are ways to PRELOAD &quot;something&quot; in order to ssh
through the proxy's https port, but still ...)
But I will manage to use Larry Wall's &quot;patch&quot; utility,
in case somebody provides me with a patch.

In case this is not quite the right mailing list for this topic,
pls give me a notice, where to head for and where to post this again!

Kind regards,
Jochen
