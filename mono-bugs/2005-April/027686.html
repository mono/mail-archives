+Summary: Writing to console should be safe from finalizer
+
+Hi, I have an object with a destructor that writes to the console. No 
+problem, works fine. Except when my process calls System.Environment.Exit
+(), in which case it dies with a NullPointerException. This doesn't 
+happen deterministicalle -- on my dual-CPU machine, I get the error maybe 
+once in every ten runs.
+
+Obviously what is happening is that the GC occasionally destroys stdout 
+and stderr before the finalizer for my object runs, so things blow up 
+then.
+
+The interesting thing is that the .NET runtime does *not* do that. From 
+one of the .NET developers (Brian Grunkemeyer):
+
+&quot;Back during the implementation of V1.0, I was debugging a problem where 
+a finalizer didn’t seem to be called. To help figure out if the finalizer 
+was running at all, I added a call to Console.WriteLine inside it, but 
+then my app started blowing up with an unhandled ObjectDisposedException. 
+How could simply adding a call to Console.WriteLine to the finalizer 
+break the app?
+
+The problem turned out to be that the underlying console stream was being 
+finalized before my instance. The lesson I learned was to follow this 
+guideline: only use non-finalizable instance data from your own 
+finalizer. But I also happened to own the code for the Console class, so 
+I special cased Console.WriteLine—now we never close the handles for 
+stdout, stdin, or stderr. This is somewhat useful for printf-style 
+debugging and logging, and turned out later to be required to support 
+multiple appdomains within the same process (i.e. you don’t want 
+arbitrary appdomains closing your process-wide handle for stdout). So 
+bottom line: using Console from your finalizer is actually a safe thing 
+to do, but watch out for everything else.&quot;
+
+This is taken from: <A HREF="http://www.bluebytesoftware.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?">http://www.bluebytesoftware.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?</A>

+
+The quoted comment appears about two-thirds down the page.
+
+Even though the spec does not guarantee that stdout and stderr should be 
+available in finalizers, the .NET runtime is implemented that way, 
+meaning that a program that was developed under .NET and ported to Mono 
+(as is the case for me) may randomly fail during process shutdown. That's 
+not a good thing. And being able to use the console in finalizers is 
+useful during debugging.
+
+So, could you change Mono to provide the same guarantee please?
+
+Cheers,
+
+Michi.
