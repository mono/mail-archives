 Jon, ok to commit these files and the fix to UnixEndPoint in
 Mono.Unix? Any comment on the behavior in the listener when the file
 already exists?

 The Connect() idea sounds like the way to go to me.

+Please merge the Mono.Posix UnixEndPoint changes into Mono.Unix.
+
+As for the classes, I have the following comments:
+
+Summary: I'm against permitting derivation unless there's a
+good use case, *especially* for types that contain a
+finalizer.  If you want to permit derivation, split the
+finalizable resource into a separate class.  This is to keep
+the finalizable GC graph as small as possible, improving GC
+performance.  See also: 
+

+
+Though maybe I'm being too nit-picky...
+
+UnixClient:
+	- It should use the Mono.Unix namespace, and be placed 
+	  into Mono.Unix.
+	- The class has no functional virtual methods.  It should 
+	  be `sealed', unless there's a good use case to permit 
+	  derivation.
+	- Dispose(bool) should be non-virtual (if the class 
+	  becomes `sealed').
+	- Dispose(bool) should set `disposed = true` at the end.
+	  (Think exception safety.)
+	- `this.' isn't necessary (see Close()).
+	- I dislike &quot;brace hugging&quot;; e.g. &quot;else&quot; and &quot;finally&quot; 
+	  should start a new line
+	- CheckDisposed() should be called at the start of every
+	  major method/property.  This includes LingerState,
+	  ReceiveBufferSize, etc.  GetStream() calls it in a
+	  finally block (WTF?).
+	- There should be a UnixClient(UnixEndPoint) constructor
+	- Protected methods should be private (unless we're
+	  supporting derivation).
+	- Why is Init() a separate method?  Rename it to
+	  UnixClient(AddressFamily), and call it as a
+	  constructor.
+	- Whats `active' supposed to represent?  It looks like
+	  it matches `disposed'.
+	- What's the lifetime semantics of the class?  That is,
+	  should it be possible to Connect/Close/Connect/Close
+	  multiple times?  If so, Connect should set
+	  disposed=false and shouldn't call CheckDisposed().
+	- Public parameters should follow camelCase convention
+	  (remote_end_point).
+	- Should Dispose(bool) calls client.Close() even 
+	  if s != null?
+	- I'd like it if:
+	  - Active and Client properties were removed
+	  - UnixClient had a UnixClient(Socket) constructor
+	    (thus removing the need for SetUnixClient)
+	
+UnixListener:
+	- Should implement IDisposable.  ALL types that have
+	  finalizers should implement IDisposable.
+	- Should be `sealed', unless there's a good use case for
+	  derivation in the absence of virtual methods.
+	- Public parameters should follow camelCase convention
+	  (local_end_point).
+	- Remove protected properties
+	- Consider renaming AcceptUnixClient to
+	  CreateUnixClient, and renaming AcceptSocket to Accept.
+	- Stop() never clears `server', nor does it set
+	  &quot;active=false&quot;.  Can Stop() be called multiple times?
+	  (It could be invoked concurrently between the
+	  finalizer thread and the app thread).  Can
+	  server.Shutdown() and server.Close() be called
+	  concurrently?  Is this a security issue?
+	- File binding should behave as XSP does (try to
+	  Connect(), and if it works, fail with an
+	  InvalidOperationException.  The library shouldn't
+	  delete files unless explicitly told to.
+	- Provide a Start() overload to accept the backlog size
+	  (solving the comment in Stop());
+
