Zip File Containing Sample Reproducable App and Copy &amp; Paste of Error &amp; Stack
Trace

Description of Problem: 

The iPhone Window Application I've been developing has been working great for
weeks.  This morning, I was prompted to upgrade to 1.5, and since I upgraded,
my application crashes almost immediately.  To be more specific, it will load
the first Tab, Navigation Controller, View Controller, and View correctly, but
as soon I as I click to go to another of the other tabs in my application, the
attached error (MonoTouchError.rtf) occurs.

Steps to reproduce the problem:

I've created a small sample application that replicates my problem, and I've
attached it to this bug entry.  This application is structured as follows:

There is a Tab Bar Controller, which contains 2 Navigation Controllers, which
each contain a View Controller, which each contain a View, which each contains
a Grouped Table View, which each contains a Table View Cell.  When clicked,
each of these cells will simply push another View Controller on the stack.

If you run the application, you can reproduce the issue by repeatedly clicking
the Table View Cell of the first Tab.  You will know when the issue has
occurred because the Table View will draw itself about 10 pixels higher.  At
this point, if you simply click to go to the second Tab, the application will
crash.

Granted, I understand that repeatedly loading X number of Views can be
problematic, but in my real application, it is not loading X number of Views
like my sample application is.  And again, my real application used to work
until today after upgrading.

Actual Results:

I've attached the error in the MonoTouchError.rtf file.

Expected Results:

I expect it to not crash! ;)

How often does this happen? 

Every time.

Additional Information:

Please feel free to contact me anytime for more information.
