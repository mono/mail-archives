+------- Additional Comments From <A HREF="mailto:diltonm@McCOMSoft.com">diltonm@McCOMSoft.com</A>  2004-04-14 17:31 -------
+&gt; This is taken very seriously.
+
+Thanks.
+
+&gt; How did you install Mono? Did you build on your own, or are you 
+using an RPM?
+
+Most of the time I build and install from source but I've tried from 
+RPMs on one machine. I've duplicated this bug on several machines 
+all running the default Fedora 1 Core as well as Windows XP.
+
+I've tried the posted version on www.go-mono.com and CVS snapshots.
+
+It fails with exactly the same error on Windows XP and Fedora 1 Core 
+and has been since I posted the bug originally.
+
+It WAS working in 0.29 for sure, and even 0.28 IIRC.
+
+&gt; Have you been using the same setup since the time when you first
+reported this bug? You may very well have stale files on your 
+machine.
+
+If you read through the history you will see that I've duplicated 
+this bug on several machines of which, well, several were plain 
+vanilla, no prior hint of Mono. I will detail for you the procedure 
+I follow rigidly:
+
+On Fedora - I download the tar ball, read README and INSTALL, follow 
+the instructions, try to compile the sample code and then the error 
+that I've been reporting pops up.
+
+On Windows - I uninstall Mono from Add/Remove programs, download and 
+install the latest then try my test program and get exactly the same 
+error.
+
+&gt; As for the information Miguel mentioned, it's specifically:
+
+On Fedora here is my printout:
+
+[<A HREF="mailto:xxxxx@xxxxxxx">xxxxx@xxxxxxx</A> 30crash]# mono --version
+Mono JIT compiler version 0.31, (C) 2002-2004 Novell, Inc and 
+Contributors. www.go-mono.com
+        TLS:           NPTL
+        GC:            Included Boehm (with typed GC)
+        Globalization: none
+[<A HREF="mailto:xxxxx@xxxxxxx">xxxxx@xxxxxxx</A> 30crash]#
+
+On Windows XP:
+
+C:\&gt;mono --version
+Mono JIT compiler version 0.31, (C) 2002-2004 Novell, Inc and 
+Contributors. www
+go-mono.com
+        TLS:           normal
+        GC:            System Boehm (no typed GC available)
+        Globalization: ICU
+C:\&gt;
+
+Yes the version seems to be slightly different and no I'm not going 
+to try the latest CVS (again) until someone there does what all we 
+software engineers do to close bugs properly and that is prove there 
+that you can delete Utils.dll and rebuild it then Client.cs and the 
+bug does not happen and do this on Fedora 1 (no updates) and Windows 
+XP (all updates) and do it sucessfully (deleting Utils.dll each 
+time) for several times in a row.
+
+This is a work blocking, compiler crash bug gentlemen, one that has 
+slipped through the past several releases even though your team was 
+made aware of it by me.
+
+Dilton
