+Summary: Mono major assembly loader issues
+
+I've stumbed upon the following major differences between the MS.NET and 
+Mono assembly loader :
+
+1) Mono immediately resolves the whole tree of assembly references 
+(meaning if loading an assembly &quot;a&quot;, not only the assemblies referenced 
+by &quot;a&quot; are loaded but also all assemblies referenced by the assembly &quot;a&quot; 
+references), while MS.NET only immediately loads the direct assembly 
+references.
+
+let's assume the following dependency tree :
+
+a.dll
+    -&gt; b.dll
+        -&gt; c.dll
+
+when loading assembly &quot;a&quot;, MS.NET will only immediately load 
+assembly &quot;b&quot;.  Only when accessing types from assembly &quot;c&quot;, it will load 
+that assembly (and its direct references).
+
+This also affects the compile process : using csc, you only need to 
+reference assembly &quot;b&quot; to build assembly &quot;a&quot;.  But using mcs, you need to 
+reference both assembly &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; to build assembly &quot;c&quot;.
+
+2) Mono currently does not use the privatePath specified in the 
+configuration\runtime\assemblyBinding\probing element (see c.exe.config in 
+attached tar) to resolve assembly references.
+
+Now, I've attached a tar file which will allow you to reproduce both 
+issues :
+
+1) This issue can be reproduce both at runtime and at the compilation 
+phase.
+
+runtime
+-------
+To reproduce this issue at runtime, just run a.exe without arguments using 
+Mono :
+
+mono a.exe
+
+This will fail on Mono as it will try to load assembly &quot;c&quot;, but can't find 
+this.  This succeeds on MS.NET as only assembly &quot;b&quot; is directly referenced 
+by assemby &quot;a&quot;, and this assembly can indeed be loaded (as its in the same 
+directory as assembly &quot;a&quot;)
+
+compile
+--------
+To reproduce this issue during compilation, just try to build a.exe 
+without referencing assembly &quot;c&quot; :
+
+mcs /target:exe /out:a.exe /r:b.dll a.cs
+
+This will fail as Mono immediately tries to load assembly &quot;c&quot; too, and it 
+can't find this ofcourse.
+
+Again, this works fine using csc :
+
+csc /target:exe /out:a.exe /r:b.dll a.cs
+
+To build assembly &quot;c&quot; using mcs you must use this (notice that I added a 
+reference for assembly &quot;c&quot; before the reference to assembly &quot;b&quot;) :
+
+mcs /target:exe /out:a.exe /r:assembly-c/c.dll /r:b.dll a.cs
+
+2) On both MS.NET and Mono, running a.exe with a random argument will 
+fail :
+
+eg. (mono) a.exe justsometest
+
+as in that case (when at least one argument is specified) a.exe will 
+instantiate a class in assembly &quot;b&quot;, which itself also instantiates a 
+class in assembly &quot;c&quot;. And as assembly &quot;c&quot; is not in the privatepath that 
+is probed for assembly references, both MS.NET as Mono fail to locate 
+assembly &quot;c&quot;, which is correct behaviour for both.
+
+Now, there are actually two ways to have the runtime locate assembly &quot;c&quot; 
+(without moving it to the same directory as assembly &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;) :
+
+- Specify additonal directories that the runtime should probe for 
+assemblies in the privatePath attribute of the 
+configuration/runtime/assemblyBinding/probing element in the application 
+configuration file :
+
+        &lt;assemblyBinding xmlns=&quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1&quot;&gt;
+            &lt;probing privatePath=&quot;assembly-c;&quot; /&gt;
+        &lt;/assemblyBinding&gt;
+
+    I included a config file in the tar, just rename app.config to 
+a.exe.config and execute a.exe again with a random argument :
+
+    eg. (mono) a.exe justsometest
+
+    This will succeed on MS.NET, but will still fail on Mono.  I assume 
+Mono does not use add the directory in the privatePath attribute to the 
+probing path.
+
+- Use the AppDomain.AppendPrivatePath method to add an additional 
+directory to the private loader path, can you test this by passing 
+the &quot;assembly-c&quot; directory (which contains assembly &quot;c&quot;) as argument to 
+a.exe, as the first argument that is passed to a.exe will actually be 
+appended to the private path.
+
+eg. (mono) a.exe assembly-c (after first moving/renaming the application 
+configuration file again)
+
+This will succeed on MS.NET (to ensure this), but will fail on Mono 
+(because of issue 1).
