+Summary: Beta 2 Chunked-Encoding critical bug.
+
+There is a nasty bug in MONO (I tested in Beta 2) when reading from a 
+Http Stream that is chunked-encoded.  I believe the bug(s) are in the 
+following 3 classes:
+ChunkStream.cs
+WebConnectionStream.cs
+WebConnection.cs
+
+Please run the testcase test1.cs on MS.NET to see the correct (and 
+obviously expected) output which just downloads a WSDL file and prints 
+out the first few bytes (and characters).  Then try the test on MONO to 
+see the very weird and incorrect output.  The second part of the test 
+demonstrates a freezing problem on MONO when I enable KeepAlives (I have 
+no idea why?).
+
+This is an intermittent bug, so try running the test a few times as the 
+output seems to depend on timing (how much of the web servers response is 
+sitting in the MONO client's buffer).
+
+Clue 1: The only way I have been able to get 100% reliable results is by 
+editing the WebConnectionStream.Read method and between the last two 
+lines (ReginRead and EndRead - for the asynchronous read) I inserted 
+a &quot;ReadAll()&quot; internal method call.  I am pretty sure this is pulling all 
+the response stream into the MONO client's buffer thus the problem never 
+occurs.  Of course, this is not a fix, and I just mention it to help you 
+understand the bug.
+
+Clue 2: I also tried to find out what was happening in the 
+WebConnection.Read method.  I noted it calls &quot;nstream.Read&quot; and what is 
+strange is that even though that method might be called as &quot;int result = 
+nstream.Read(buffer, 0, 4)&quot;, result will often be set to 0 even though 
+bytes have been copied into the buffer.  Thus it would appear erroneous 
+bytes were copied into the buffer but the method returned that 0 bytes 
+were copied.  Obviously this is a clue as to the error.
+
+Clue 3: This only happens when the server uses Chunked-Encoding.
