 Here is a minimum number of changes plus some GC_PRINT_STAT statements to follow what is happening.  I mispoke earlier when I said I was using gcc.  I was using msft vc7.

+From Hans Boehm=&gt;
+
+Unfortunately, I can't really run code like this behind the HP firewall.
+I might be able to do it from home.  (Should this work on WinME?)
+
+Did you try asking about this on the Mono mailing list?
+
+Based on the log files you sent, there appear to be two problems,
+which may
+be unrelated:
+
+1) The collector is seeing too many false pointers, causing it to
+blacklist the
+pages they point to, and making it difficult for it to find anyplace
+to allocate
+new pages.  This is causing the heap growth.  (I think a call to
+GC_dump() late
+in the execution would confirm this.  The messages about &quot;very large&quot;
+objects which turn
+out not to be that big are very suggestive, as it stands.)
+
+This is almost certainly due to the collector getting insufficient
+type information,
+which it presumably needs since you have a bunch of compressed data in
+the heap,
+which looks random.  And I can reproduce logs similar to this aspect
+of your
+log with a simple test program that has similar characteristics.
+
+My reading of the Mono code is that recent versions (last few months
+at least)
+should give the collector enough type information that this shouldn't
+be an issue.
+Again GC_dump() output could partially confirm that's working.
+
+Setting the ignore_off_page flag in your patch largely circumvents
+this problem,
+but that's not a great solution.
+
+2) Your logs indicate that garbage collections often happen in rapid
+succession,
+sometimes with no allocation between collections.  I can't reproduce
+this in isolation.
+But I note that Mono contains explicit GC_gcollect() calls.  I
+normally consider those
+somewhat suspect.  It would be good to know what the call stack looks
+like for those
+collector invocations.  (I think your Sleep() calls may avoid some of
+these.)
+
+I would expect this to primarily slow things down.  I think (1) is the
+main problem.
+
+My current assessment is that with fairly high probability, you are
+really seeing
+Mono issues, and not something I can address.
+
+Hans
