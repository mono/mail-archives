 My understanding is that there was a problem with a conflict between
 mono-1.1 and mono 1.x for NLD.  The mono-1.1 packages were not installable
 on an NLD box which already had mono 1.x installed.  Presumably this is
 packaging problem.  Duncan was working on this at the  end of last week -
 but I'm not sure of the current status, except that the packages aren't in
 the channel yet.

+I tried to make it build on build buddy today and it worked for SuSE
+9.2 but not NLD, because of some strange build errors. I have had it
+built successfully before, and to see that it's failing now in the
+middle of the build, I think it just has to be some sort of heisenbug.
+
+For now, I have updated the conf files (the conflict before has been
+fixed). I built the package on my laptop running NLD and the packages
+work fine. You can get them at:
+
+   /nfs/users/duncan/deploy/1.1.2/nld-9-i586
+
+I'll be back in the office to sort out this strange bug.
