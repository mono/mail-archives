           Summary: Zeroconf's AvahiDBus Provider is sometimes unable to
                    successfully Resolve()
    Classification: Mono
           Product: Mono: Class Libraries
           Version: SVN
          Platform: All
        OS/Version: Ubuntu
            Status: NEW
          Severity: Normal
          Priority: P5 - None
         Component: Mono.Zeroconf
        AssignedTo: <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-bugs">abockover at novell.com</A>
        ReportedBy: <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-bugs">xerox1101 at gmail.com</A>

User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10)

I have one DAAP server on my network that I am trying to resolve using
Mono.Zeroconf. Right now the code is always able to find the server (ie.
OnServiceAdded is called), but when I then call args.Service.Resolve() I do not
get a response all of the time. This makes Mono.Zeroconf fairly unreliable for
my setup, which I feel is problematic.

I thought it might have been my code at first, but I'm seeing this same
behavior running the standard MZClient so now it seems more like an issue with
Zeroconf. I added some debugging messages in the current Zeroconf SVN code and
I can tell that it's definitely using the AvahiDBus provider, but I couldn't
find an obvious issue outside of that (of course I don't really know the code
base or how to debug what might be a DBus issue).


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have a DAAP server running on the network
2. Run the MZClient on a Linux machine with the following parameters
    ./MZClient.exe -v -r -t _daap._tcp
3. Repeat until you see the problem (for me I can repeat it in, at most, 20
attempts and sometimes way more frequently)
Actual Results:  
*** Found name = 'Yoshi', type = '_daap._tcp', domain = 'local'
is printed and then nothing else

Expected Results:  
*** Found name = 'Yoshi', type = '_daap._tcp', domain = 'local'
is printed followed by
*** Resolved name = 'Yoshi._daap._tcp.local', host ip = '192.168.1.124' ...

I took a look at the current bug list and I think that this is a different
issue than everything on there currently. Of the only two similar bugs, I don't
think that this is the same as bug #430732 because the poster there is still
always able to resolve and I'm not really sure what bug #473695 is talking
about so I'm going to guess it's different.
