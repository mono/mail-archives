+I may have been incorrect in some of my characterization of the but, due to testing with 
+the MS C# compiler before I realized that the bug was occurring during assembly creation.
+
+New description:
+When encoding a blob for a custom attribute, if the parameters for the attribute 
+constructor consists of a params array of objects that includes (as one of its elements) 
+another array, the inner array will not be encoded correctly.
+
+This happened because the call to the function to encode each element was not passing 
+the correct type information, and elements would not be encoded correctly.
+
+This bug would manifest itself only at runtime, and only if there was a call to get the 
+custom attributes on the item that had the bogus data encoding.
+
+---
+
+On another note, this is my first foray into Mono development, so I don't have permission 
+to apply patches or anything fancy like that. I would appreciate it if someone with the 
+appropriate permissions would test my fix (the code in the initial example should compile 
+and run correctly after applying the patch) and enter it into the repository.
