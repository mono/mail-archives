+------- Additional Comments From <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-bugs">lupus at ximian.com</A>  2007-05-23 07:29 -------
+The detection must happen also in the trusted code, because the user
+can trivially fill most of the stack and then call a function in the
+trusted code that makes it overflow, so we need to be able to handle
+the overflow there, too.
+
+It may be possible for us to implement the check without slowing down
+normal function calls (but we'd still need to use sigaltstack in this
+case). It should be as follows: we setup a small sigalt stack for each
+thread so that the SEGV handler can run: the handler would be very
+simple, basically just check if it happened in managed/unmanaged code.
+
+In unmanaged code we have no other sane option than abort. In the
+managed case we'd create a handler call frame in the user stack and
+transfer control to it. Note that no GC objects are manpulated in this
+stack, so it doesn't need to be registered with the GC and tracked.
+8 KB of memory should be plenty for this stack.
+
+Now, before setting up the handler frame in the original stack, we
+need to properly mprotect() the stack area that was PROT_NONE before
+to trigger the SEGV (if this was a stack overflow, otherwise this is
+not needed). As we unwind the stack we can mprotect(PROT_NONE) again.
+
+We should always leave at least one page protected to handle cases
+like the finally one above (but Robert's test won't work with this new
+setup, because you'd neeed to trigger the handler with an actual stack
+overflow, not just a null reference exception).
+The handler running in the altstack can detect if a stack overflow
+handler was already executing and simply abort the finally clause that
+caused the new overflow (the call-finally thunk can setup a LMF entry,
+for example).
+
+The trick here is to reserve a few pages at the end of the stack for
+this purpouse, in addition to the system-setup page. Managed code
+wouldn't need any code in the prolog, because the handler can run in
+the alt stack (for systems that don't support the alt stack we'll need
+to add the checks so that there is enough room for the kernel to put
+the signal handling frame there).
+
+Now we need to protect unmanaged code from overflowing the stack: to
+prevent this we need to add the stack-banging code in the
+managed-&gt;unmanaged wrappers (this includes compilation trampolines);
+they should touch a few pages (configurable), depending on how much
+stack our runtime needs. To reduce the need for stack in the runtime
+we need to audit and remove all the uses of alloca() and heavy stack
+users.
+
+Having the checks only in the managed-&gt;unmanaged wrappers wouldn't
+reduce our performance in a significant way.
