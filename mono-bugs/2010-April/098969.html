           Summary: MonoTouch app process not being killed when app
                    stopped in MonoDevelop
    Classification: Mono
           Product: MonoTouch
           Version: SVN
          Platform: Macintosh
        OS/Version: Mac OS X 10.6
            Status: NEW
          Severity: Major
          Priority: P5 - None
         Component: Debugger
        AssignedTo: <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-bugs">gnorton at novell.com</A>
        ReportedBy: <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-bugs">ianvink at gmail.com</A>

User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US)
AppleWebKit/533.2 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.342.8 Safari/533.2

Happens 50% of the time, regardless of the app I debug.

Problem: 
Start up an app so that it runs in the iPhone simulator
Have the app stop at a break point in code
Kill the app by clicking the red 'x' in MonoDevelop
The app closes in the Simulator.
However, Activity Monitor shows the app still running, and it jumps to 150% and
stays there until killed.

I have tried closing MonoDevelop and every other Mac program, and it stays
running at 150% until I use Activity Monitor to shut it down.

I have seen this reported by several people on the MonoTouch forums and
Stackoverflow.com but no one has an solution.

Started happening after I upgrade from 1.4.7. Before that it worked fine.

Note: If you use the iPhone Simulator's Home button to kill/stop the app it
works fine, never hangs around.
