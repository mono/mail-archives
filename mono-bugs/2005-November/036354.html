 &gt;As a conclusion I think fixing this bug has no inpact on mono but 
 &gt;xsp has bugs that should be fixed by making it able to run on MS.NET.
 
 ...and hence the conclusion is bogus too.

+------- Additional Comments From <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-bugs">kornelpal at hotmail.com</A>  2005-11-23 15:32 -------
+&gt;Really? What's the rationale for this? You can run xsp as long as
+&gt;Mono.WebServer and Mono.Security are in the same directory *and* in
+&gt;the bin directory.
+
+It seems that I worded my comment to offensive, sorry for that. I 
+just mentioned GAC because I think it's the easiest configuration as 
+you don't have to take care about assembly resolving, assemblies 
+installed to the GAC will be loaded when needed . So I just wanted 
+to mean that XSP should have minimal MS.NET support. Sorry for 
+picking XSP, my statements apply for all of our assemblies.
+
+&gt;&gt;But it should not use methods found in xsp.exe in 
+&gt;&gt;the new AppDomain unless it loads xsp.exe to the new AppDomain 
+&gt;&gt;explicitly otherwise this will be another xsp bug that will preven 
+&gt;&gt;mono runtime being patched.
+&gt;
+&gt;This comment is completely bogus...
+
+As I see, currently the created new domains require xsp.exe. When 
+running on MS.NET I had to copy xsp.exe to the bin directory of the 
+web application to make the runtime able to find it. Otherwise it 
+throws an excetption. (If I'm wrong please let me know but this is 
+what I experienced.)
+
+I did not want to offend XSP. I just wanted to explain that none of 
+our assemblies should assume Mono runtime bugs as it will make 
+fixing runtime bug difficult. I think the best way to aviod relaying 
+on runtime bugs it to test our assemblies on MS.NET runtime as well 
+that even can help to uncover some bugs in either runtimes.
+
+As I see XSP assumes the bug in question to be a feature, but I may 
+be wrong.
+
+This was the XSP part of my comment, now back to the bug itself:
+
+Previously I attached four test cases that show that current runtime 
+behavior is bogus and after applying the patch the runtime behaves 
+as expected. Please run the tests on MS.NET as well as on Mono. Note 
+that for all the tests by copying MyClassLibrary.dll to the 
+directory of MyApplication.exe you can see the result when runtime 
+is able to load MyClassLibrary.dll.
+
+I see anything in Mono runtime that would break if the patch 
+proposed by Jb Evain were applied. Do we have any reason not to 
+apply this patch?
