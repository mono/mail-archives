--- Comment #17 from Jeffrey Stedfast &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-bugs">jeff at xamarin.com</A>&gt; 2011-07-20 15:05:46 UTC ---
Rene, MonoTouch 4.0.x uses Mono 2.10.x (I think 2.10.1 or 2.10.2 depending on
which MT).

&gt;<i> Are you telling me that the sample I attached also fails on a desktop Mono app
</I>on Mac OS?

Unfortunately, yes, it fails on desktop MacOSX too. It's not the hang that you
describe, though, so it might not be the same issue. Instead, it's an exception
that gets thrown when writing data to the file that happens randomly (sometimes
during the Dispose()/Flush() and sometimes just with an incremental Write() to
the downloaded file).

I was testing on MacOSX because I was trying to see if the issue you described
was reproducible on the desktop and whether or not your bug was related to a
Socket.BeginConnect() bug I was verifying a fix for (since that would cause
hangs in MonoTouch 4.x and on MacOSX).

Anyhow... I'm gonna forget debugging the issue I ran into for now and get back
on track trying to reproduce the bug you described on iOS.
