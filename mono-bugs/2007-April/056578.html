+Summary: Two authenticode issues
+
+I'm working with the authenticode classes in the 
+Mono.Security.Authenticode namespace, and I've hit two issues which I 
+believe are bugs.
+To let you guys quickly duplicate the problem, I've uploaded some binary 
+test files I'm using:
+<A HREF="http://pieter.mentalis.org/signed_files.zip">http://pieter.mentalis.org/signed_files.zip</A>
+ - &quot;signed_file.exe&quot; is a hotfix file I downloaded from Microsoft.com. It 
+is signed with a Microsoft Software Publishers certificate. According to 
+WinVerifyTrust, the file signature is correct.
+ - &quot;invalid_signed_file.exe&quot; is the same file, but I've changed a few 
+bits here and there. WinVerifyTrust says that the signature is invalid 
+(as I expected).
+ - &quot;Microsoft_Root_CA.cer&quot; is the Microsoft Root certificate. I extracted 
+it from 'signed_file.exe'. I copied this file to the Mono trusted CA 
+store (C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application 
+Data\.mono\certs\Trust)
+
+
+
+Problem 1:
+----------
+
+I've written a small application to test the Authenticode deformatter. 
+Basically, it consists of the following two lines of code:
+
+    AuthenticodeDeformatter adf = new AuthenticodeDeformatter
+(@&quot;xxx\signed_file.exe&quot;);
+    bool it = adf.IsTrusted();
+
+Oddly enough, IsTrusted always returned false. The reason, according to 
+the defotmatter, was that the root certificate is not trusted (which 
+should not be the case, as I copied the certificate from the authenticode 
+file into the trusted store). Upon investigation, I found out that the 
+X509Chain.Build method always returned false, because a deeper call to 
+the 'IsTrusted' method (via the 'FindCertificateRoot' method) always 
+failed. Using QuickWatch, I was able to see that the TrustAnchors 
+collection _did_ contain the MS root certificate, and that 
+the 'potentialTrusted' certificate was indeed the same root certificate, 
+yet the Contains method returned that the certificate could not be found 
+in the collection.
+
+The reason of this error is that the comparison between the certificates 
+tries to compare MD5 hashes with SHA-1 hashes. The Hash property of the 
+certificate that is loaded from the authenticode file returns a SHA-1 
+hash, while the Hash property of the certificate loaded from the mono 
+trusted CA store returns an MD5 hash. Obviously, things go wrong when 
+trying to match these hashes.
+I don't know why one instance of the MS Root CA returns one type hash, 
+and the other instance another type of hash. I'll leave that up to you 
+guys :-)
+
+One last thought: if I remember correctly, the Windows CryptoAPI offers 
+you the choice between the 'defatult' hash of the certificate, the MD5 
+hash or the SHA-1 hash. It would be nice if Mono could do this too. In 
+this case, the bug would be trivial to fix: instead of asking for 
+the 'default' hash, you could match specifically on, for instance, the 
+SHA-1 hash.
+
+
+
+
+Problem 2:
+----------
+
+After changing some code such that the MS Root CA would be recognized as 
+a trusted CA, I tried verifying the &quot;invalid_signed_file.exe&quot;. To my 
+amazement, this returned no errors. The AuthenticodeDeformatter.IsTrusted 
+method returns true, even though I would have expected it to return false.
+It could be that this is the intended behavior of the IsTrusted method 
+(there were no docs, so I couldn't be sure about that), but I don't see 
+any other method to verify the signature on the file.
