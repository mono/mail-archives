           Summary: After changing the combo box items selection, the
                    application is getting crashed.
           Product: Mono: Class Libraries

Description of Problem: After changing the combo box items selection, the
application is getting crashed.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Development steps:

   a. Added TabControl control in a form.
   b. Added TabPages to the TabControl.
   c. Placed combo box in one of the tab pages and added four static items to 
      the combo items list. Set the DropDown property to 'DropDrownList'.
   d. Added SelectedIndexChanged event to the combo box.

2. Run Time steps we execute in combo box selection.

   a. Reading the data from our database and based on the value getting we are 
      setting the selected index value for the combo box - getting succeeded.
   b. Fire Event handler 'SelectedIndexChaneged' - getting succeeded.
   c. Doing some operations and alerting message box - getting succeeded.
   d. After message box displays the control doesn't have code to execute.

Actual Results: After click on Ok in message box, the application is getting
crashed.

Expected Results: After click on Ok in message box the control should come out
from the event handler. Since there is nothing code to go further.


How often does this happen?  For each combo item selection.


Additional Information:

1. We have the same combo box used in another form control in our application
where panel has placed with dock property. On panel, we have placed the combo
box  which is working fine. Here we don't have any code to execute in event
handler.

2. We have used the combo box in a tabpage where we have also placed the panel
on tabpage and then placed the comb box on it. Which is getting failed in
'SelectedIndexChanged' event handler.
