Description of Problem:

File ownership and permissions can not be set using MonoVS in the packaing
module.  This is critical for proper security and function of installed Linux
packages.

Default ownership and permissions should be settable.  This default setting
goes at the top of the file list in the RPM spec file.

Subsequent changes to the default should be settable on a per-file/directory
basis and also have the option to be recursive for directories.

An example of how this affects blogengine is that the App_Data directory needs
to be writable by the web server process which runs as wwwrun.  In the current
situation, the directory is owned by root with permissions drwxr-xr-x making it
impossible for the web server to create new data.  This directory also contains
files and directories which also need to be writable by the web process.

It's important to note that simply changing a directory and it's contents to
&quot;world-writable&quot;, it not acceptable and creates security.  Such security
attacks could include a user deleting all world writable directories and files
or filling up the partition with data in a writable area of the file system,
exploiting temporary files could give access to any file the web server
(wwwrun) has access to, etc.  There are other possibilities as well.
