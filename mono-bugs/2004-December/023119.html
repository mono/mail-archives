 [4] Precise Bounds for Montgomery Modular Multiplication and Some

+There are 2 important points here:
+
+1 - Fixing the problem
+
+* Thanks for the links. I will compare them with Mono implementation
+of BigInteger. I know the implementation could be more efficient (not
+just for the Montgomery implementation) and probably more secure. 
+
+BTW paper [4] is also freely available from
+<A HREF="http://www.comodogroup.com/research/crypto/CDW_RSA_2002_Monty.ps">http://www.comodogroup.com/research/crypto/CDW_RSA_2002_Monty.ps</A>
+
+
+2 - Finding out how it affects Mono
+
+* This part is harder as I don't have enough informations with the bug
+report (it's the reason I changed the bug status to NEEDINFO).
+
+- Is this a 128 bits key pair ? or 
+- Are you able to find the 128 bits secret key of a key exchange ?
+- If so (secret) what was the size of the public key involved ?
+
+If it's a 128 bits key pair, then I can factor such a key in less than
+a minute (like 5 seconds) on my computer (P4 @ 2.8 Hgz).

+
+However I'm curious about how your program scales with bigger key size
+(i.e. at what point, if any, it is able to guess faster than I can
+factor). Plotting a graph with different key size would be useful.
+Let's start small, say 128, 130, 132, ... up to one hour computation,
+as I don't think we'll get very high in bits count very soon ;-).
+
+There are also other requirements for a timing attack (e.g. having
+several measurements) that aren't required when factoring.
