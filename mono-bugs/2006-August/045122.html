+Awesome feedback guys... my responses are prefixed by &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;
+
+* If the callback throws, the scheduler thread is killed.
+&gt;&gt; perfect catch, I&quot;ll add a catch all &quot;catch Exception&quot; in order to
+correct this.
+
+Style wise, this patch needs some work:
+
++			static object sync_obj = new object();
++			static object sync_obj2 = new object();
+
+How are those used?
+
+&gt;&gt; sync_obj is used to prevent race conditions on the &quot;GetInstance&quot;
+call of the singleton TimerScheduler class. sync_obj2 is used to make
+signaling the scheduler class sane so only one signal is sent at a
+time and a decision can be made on the signal so signals are &quot;batched&quot;
+or discarded .With that said, I'm not sure why I have 2 separate sync
+objects, I should be able to combine them without issues.
+
+Why is TimerScheduler a class? it seems like it could be static
+methods in Timer? Also, why a TimerJob class. This is a 1&lt;-&gt;1 relation
+with a Timer.
+
+&gt;&gt; Timer scheduler is a singleton class because it has a 1-1 mapping
+with a timer-scheduler thread which is the thread in charge of firing
+all the timer events, so it is a 1 to n mapping between
+timer-scheduler threads and timers. Now with regards to why it needs
+to be a class of its own instead of  static methods in Timer i guess
+it's merely a matter of choice... I believe I chose that route just to
+keep all the scheduler logic in one place, which made it easier for me
+to merge it with the Timer class. Of course, if you guys want, I can
+made the conversion. I believe TimerJob follows under the same logic,
+I just wanted to keep the scheduler specific meta data in one place.
+
+Variables and methods are named with mixed conventions. Make things
+consistent, at the very least. In general, no underscore_names for
+methods. Also, enum values shouldn't be C_CONSTANT_NAMED.
+
+&gt;&gt; I'll correct all that
+
++			readonly int TIME_SLICE = 10 ; // 10 msec
+
+Should be const
+
+&gt;&gt; same here
+
++					log(&quot;could not properly signal timer-scheduler, waiting...&quot;);
++					Thread.Sleep(5); 
+
+THis is *really* *really* dubious. You need to do something like
+&quot;calcuate the next time you will wake up, and wait on an object with
+that timeout. Pulse the object if a new timer is added&quot;. This will
+wake up the CPU far too often, and (for example) waste battery power.
+It is a blocker for this patch.
+
+&gt;&gt; Yeah the logic is slightly counter intuitive but it actually
+performs really well under most conditions. The timer logic is
+actually very very loosely base on Quartz for java (I guess the main
+loop logic is the same). From my testing you start seeing issues once
+the number of number of timers is very large and the period of the
+events is small which puts pressure on the scheduler to run more often
+and doesn't give it a chance to sleep. Also, if the &quot;period&quot; of the
+Timer is shorter than 10 msec (the TIMER_SLICE base), we start having
+issues as well, and that is not as simple of a problem to solve as it
+may seem. I did some performance observations that you might find
+interesting here:

+
+
++			void log(string str) {
++				if (Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(&quot;MONO_TIMER_DEBUG&quot;) != null)
+
+Should probably be cached.
+
+&gt;&gt; agreed
+
+&gt;&gt; I'm going to post a new patch tonight reflecting those changes, I
+just need to test removing the &quot;sync_obj&quot; to make sure it doesn't
+create any problems. Also Miguel had suggested to change the patch to
+not use thread pool threads, so I might make that change as well but
+I'm not sure how that is going to affect performance. 
+
+Once again thanks for the very insightful feedback!
