           Summary: Running out of memory in geometry_from_str
           Product: Moonlight
           Version: unspecified
          Platform: i686
        OS/Version: Ubuntu
            Status: NEW
          Severity: Major
          Priority: P5 - None
         Component: xaml

I'm using Moonlight 1.0/1.1 svn head rev 86800 on Ubuntu feisty.
My computer is a Pentium M 1,6 Ghz with 512 MB ram.

Why i try to visit <A HREF="http://silverlight.net">http://silverlight.net</A> i'm running out of momory:


13608 dna       18   0 1201m 205m 2420 D  6.0 43.6   0:20.26 firefox-bin

load average: 57.35, 21.45, 8.14
Cpu(s):  3.0%us, 75.8%sy, 19.9%ni,  0.0%id,  0.0%wa,  0.7%hi,  0.7%si,  0.0%st
Mem:    482544k total,   475408k used,     7136k free,       16k buffers
Swap:  1220920k total,  1217596k used,     3324k free,    14864k cached

And my computer is knocked out. Other pages, for example the Quickstart
Mediaplayer on my own page works well.

I discussed this with toshok on irc, his comments:

&lt;toshok&gt; so it seems like something in geometry_from_str is causing the
problems
&lt;toshok&gt; presumably due to you running out of physical ram :)
&lt;dna&gt; is there any reason to eat so much ram ? ;)
&lt;toshok&gt; it shouldn't be - the paths aren't that large
&lt;toshok&gt; the first one in the xaml I downloaded, for instance is only 9964
bytes
