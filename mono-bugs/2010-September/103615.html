This output happens in everyone of my projects. However, the app seems to be
working in the simulator.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Compile an app and run it in the simulator
2. Check the Application Output
Actual Results:  
See details...

Expected Results:  
There shouldn't be any warnings...
