Description of Problem:

Currently only the binary RPM is returned to the user or allowed to be placed
somewhere on the build machine.  The source RPM is of equal importance.  It
contains the spec file and source code used for building.

There are a couple reasons it needs to also be saved.

1) It's useful for a user to be able to rebuild an RPM using the source RPM.
2) It's an archive of the buildable source code with instructions on how to
build it.
3) Opensource software is typically distributed with the source.  If provided
as an RPM, the accompanying source is also typically distributed as a source
RPM which will make it possible to for the recipient to re-build the exact
product or modify and build his own.  If our customers distribute any software
created as opensource, this should be an option.

There's probably a few other reasons...

So, we need to have an option to also copy back the source RPM as well as the
binary RPM.
