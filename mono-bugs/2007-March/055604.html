 The format stuff shouldn't really change anything.  I just left that
 in my test case, since it was my first guess as to what might be wrong.

+Summary
+The &quot;box&quot; is dependent on the font. The box shows on &quot;normal&quot; XP
+because there's no glyph #0 present in Arial. However if you have the
+large (30mb) universal font, then unknown glyphs will be taken from
+it, and no box will be shown.
+
+Discussion (edited)
+&lt;jackson&gt; spouliot, pretty sure, does it not do that for you?
+&lt;spouliot&gt; because on my XP box I don't get the box
+&lt;spouliot&gt; it may be font specific, but Arial should be pretty standard :|
+&lt;jackson&gt; yeah, i just downloaded / compiled and ran it on windows and
+i get the box
+&lt;jackson&gt; spouliot, it could be a lang thing too?
+&lt;spouliot&gt; jackson: maybe if you're not using US-en
+&lt;jackson&gt; oh, i am using that
+&lt;jackson&gt; spouliot, what .net version are you using?
+&lt;spouliot&gt; tried 1.1 right now, trying 2.0...
+&lt;jackson&gt; I have been trying with 2.0
+&lt;spouliot&gt; no box on 2.0
+&lt;rolf&gt; jackson, spouliot: I do get the box on XP
+&lt;spouliot&gt; rolf: no, I don't
+&lt;jackson&gt; so rolf and i get it, spouliot doesnt.....i wonder why
+&lt;rolf&gt; spouliot, did you compile with mcs?
+&lt;spouliot&gt; I do get a quarter box (upper left) if I change \u0000 to
+\u0001
+&lt;spouliot&gt; rolf: csc (7.1 and 8.0)
+&lt;rolf&gt; doesn't matter, I get the box anyway
+&lt;rolf&gt; compiled with csc and mcs and gmcs
+&lt;jackson&gt; yeah i get the full box for \u0001 also
+&lt;spouliot&gt; Zhila: ah, right. don't try my memory too hard today
+&lt;jackson&gt; Zhila, knock it off, you are making things extra confusing ;-)
+&lt;spouliot&gt; jackson: \u0002 is another quarter
+&lt;jackson&gt; spouliot, still a box for me at \u0002
+&lt;jackson&gt; it sounds like you have better fonts then me
+&lt;jackson&gt; spouliot, is that with the arial font thing still in there,
+or did you comment it out?
+&lt;spouliot&gt; I didn't comment anything
+&lt;jackson&gt; either way (with or without the font being set to arial) I
+get a box for 0000, 0001, and 0002
+&lt;rolf&gt; I commented out the font and formatting stuff and I get boxes
+up to \u0009
+&lt;spouliot&gt; well I tried to comments stuff earlier but didn't get the
+box, so I gradually got back to the original sample
+&lt;jackson&gt; well, i guess no matter what, this means I can't use
+DrawString (&quot;\u0000&quot;) to get that box
+&lt;spouliot&gt; ok, I have an idea. I think I have installed the large MS
+universal font (&gt;30 mb)
+&lt;rolf&gt; tried DrawString(&quot;box&quot;)?
+&lt;spouliot&gt; so I could see SPAM in it's original form ;-)
+&lt;jackson&gt; i was just checking windows update for something like that
+&lt;jackson&gt; haha
+&lt;rolf&gt; I guess that wouldn't be culture-aware though...
+&lt;spouliot&gt; rolf: I wouldn't expect it to change the way Arial works
+:-| but maybe it defaults &quot;missing&quot; glyphs into that large font ?
+&lt;rolf&gt; spouliot, I think I read somewhere that missing glyphs are
+drawn with those rectangles 
+&lt;rolf&gt; a very long time ago...
+&lt;rolf&gt; I used to get them whenever a japanese / korean / chinese popped up
+&lt;spouliot&gt; rolf: it reminds me of something too
+&lt;jackson&gt; ok, well does anyone know a way that i can draw that box
+predictibly?  I need to draw that when a user has line feeds but they
+are in non multiline mode
+&lt;rolf&gt; doesn't &quot;\u0013' or '\u0010' work?
+* spouliot is not sure the current code can detect between a space and
+a missing glyph
+&lt;jackson&gt; oh \u0013 does work
+&lt;jackson&gt; I guess I only tried with line feed, not carriage return
+&lt;spouliot&gt; on my XP it shows '!!', and on linux I miss both left and
+right lines
+&lt;jackson&gt; oh my
+&lt;spouliot&gt; but I guess it's trying to draw a box
+&lt;spouliot&gt; jackson: does it show up correctly for you on linux ?
+&lt;rolf&gt; spouliot, did you try changing the font to something else?
+&lt;jackson&gt; \u0013 does
+&lt;spouliot&gt; rolf: same thing with Courrier
+&lt;jackson&gt; maybe we should close the bug &quot;behavior unpredictable&quot; 
+&lt;spouliot&gt; I think the large font acts as a default
+&lt;jackson&gt; yeah, that is probably what happens
+&lt;rolf&gt; I don't get any box for 10 or 13 on linux...
+&lt;jackson&gt; I do for 13 but not 10
+&lt;rolf&gt; I suppose it depends on the font I have installed :)
+&lt;jackson&gt; yeah
+&lt;rolf&gt; I don't think you'll need anything special, just draw
+whatever's there (10 or 13)
+&lt;jackson&gt; well, as long as it works on gerts machine, i can close the
+bug :)
+&lt;rolf&gt; I'd close the bug report with: &quot;it only works like this on MS
+if you don't have a decent font installed&quot;
+&lt;rolf&gt; that's closer to those areas, isn't it?
+&lt;spouliot&gt; rolf: good point, if it's the case !?!
+&lt;rolf&gt; well, I suppose only you have a decent font installed, and only
+you can't reproduce it...
+&lt;spouliot&gt; jackson: want me to try the original bug report ? to see if
+there's a box or not shown ?
+&lt;jackson&gt; i guess we can close it, since its really just font differences
+&lt;spouliot&gt; well 81219 is, but the original one may not be
+&lt;jackson&gt; spouliot, <A HREF="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=79799">http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=79799</A>
+&lt;jackson&gt; yeah, the original will probably still show the boxes for you
+&lt;spouliot&gt; I don't see box when using the instructions
