Production Mini-plants in mobile containers. Worldwide Partners program

Science Network will supply to countries and developing regions the technology and necessary support for production in series of Mini-plants in=20mobile containers (40-foot). The Mini-plant system is designed in such a way that all the production machinery is fixed on the platform of the=20container, with all wiring, piping, and installation parts; that is, they are fully equipped... and the mini-plant is ready for production.=22

More than 700 portable production systems: Bakeries, Steel Nails, Welding Electrodes, Tire Retreading, Reinforcement Bar Bending for=20Construction Framework, Sheeting for Roofing, Ceilings and Fa=E7ades, Plated Drums, Aluminum Buckets, Injected Polypropylene Housewares,=20Pressed Melamine Items (Glasses, Cups, Plates, Mugs, etc.), Mufflers, Construction Electrically Welded Mesh, Plastic Bags and Packaging,=20Mobile units of medical assistance, Sanitary Material, Hypodermic Syringes, Hemostatic Clamps, etc.=20
Science Network has started a Co-investment program for the installation of small Assembly plants to manufacture in series the Mini-plants of=20portable production on site, region or country where required. One of the most relevant features is the fact that these plants will be connected=20to the World Trade System (WTS) with access to more than 50 million raw materials, products and services and automatic transactions for=20world trade.

Due to financial reasons, involving cost and social impact, the best solution is setting up assembly plants on the same countries and regions,=20using local resources (labor, some equipment, etc.) Science Network participates at 50% (fifty percent) for investment of each Assembly plant.

If you are interested in being a Science Network partner in your country or region, you can send your CV to:
