--- Comment #3 from bryan costanich &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-bugs">bryancostanich at hotmail.com</A>&gt; 2010-10-25 00:32:59 UTC ---
So i found jpobst on teh irc chans and we started talking lolcatz, and then i
was like &quot;hey dood.&quot; and he was like &quot;fersher.&quot; and then we ate a cinnamon
roll, and he was like &quot;so bro, i think i'll check the log. you know. just to be
sure.&quot; and i was like, &quot;yeah, that would be teh awesums&quot; cause gshackles was
getting the err, as was chrisntr, and those guys are like hardcore right? so
then he was like &quot;yeah, i got teh err brotha, but only on the first times.
after that , no err.&quot; and also &quot;your bluetooth is probably a problem.&quot; and then
i was like &quot;what? i have blue teeth?&quot; and he was like: ^_^ and i was like O_o.
and then i went into settings on the emu (which is like an ostridge, but it
runs android&quot; and i was like &quot;woah. my bluetooths are err'd&quot; so i was all like
&quot;click&quot; on the bluetooths and then it turned off. and then i was like &quot;fersher
gonna run that shit agains.&quot; so i did. and the err went away and stuff werked.

so i think maybe something is wrong and you guys are trying to open a socket on
the bluetooth instead of something else. thoughts?
