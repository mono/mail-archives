+Summary: detect .NET binaries and automatically invoke them with mono
+
+This suggestion is from the mono-devel-list thread: &quot;Calling one Exe From 
+another&quot;
+
+Under mono, currently, the &quot;correct&quot; way to spawn a new .NET child process 
+is this:
+
+Process proc = new Process();
+proc.StartInfo.FileName = &quot;mono&quot;;
+proc.StartInfo.Arguments = &quot;WindowTest.exe&quot;;
+proc.Start();
+proc.WaitForExit();
+
+However, this won't work when the user's program is not running under 
+mono; this breaks binary compatibility, which is the primary goal of .NET. 
+In addition, it assumes that 'mono' can be seen on the path. While this is 
+commonly true, it is entirely possible to configure the system so 
+that 'mono' is not on the path and the user must specify the full path to 
+invoke it.
+
+Currently, with Microsoft .NET, invoking another .NET executable is no 
+different from invoking a non-.NET executable:
+
+Process proc = new Process();
+proc.StartInfo.FileName = &quot;WindowTest.exe&quot;;
+proc.Start();
+proc.WaitForExit();
+
+Under mono, though, this fails unless the system has some other, OS-level 
+means of detecting that the binary is a .NET executable. Under Windows, 
+this will mean that a mono process invoking another .NET executable will 
+result in that executable running under Microsoft .NET. While in general 
+mono tries to be as compatible as possible, if, for instance, the two 
+processes then wish to communicate using remoting, they probably won't be 
+100% compatible. It's a fair assumption that if the original process is 
+running under mono, then the child process should also be running under 
+mono. Under linux, where mono is in most cases the only .NET framework 
+installed, the executable will not run at all, so the ethics of the matter 
+are out of the question.
+
+This &quot;Wishlist&quot; suggestion, then, is for mono's proc.Start() to read the 
+signature of the specified binary and determine whether it is a .NET 
+executable. If it is, then it should behave as though the user code had in 
+fact said this:
+
+proc.StartInfo.FileName = &quot;mono&quot;;
+proc.StartInfo.Arguments = &quot;WindowTest.exe&quot;;
+
+..but with the added benefit of being able to automatically locate 
+the 'mono' binary on the current system. This will also mean that if the 
+user has multiple versions of 'mono' installed, the child process will 
+always be invoked with the same version as the parent, which is, I think, 
+desirable :-)
+
+I am unsure of ways in which this could be worked around in the rare case 
+that the code author *knows* the binary will be running under mono and 
+wants the child process to be executed with a different runtime. One 
+possibility is a program such as the START.EXE which Win9x is bundled 
+with; invoking &quot;start WindowTest.exe&quot; is effectively identical to 
+invoking &quot;WindowTest.exe&quot; directly, and would provide an &quot;escape hatch&quot; 
+for user code that wanted to bypass common sense. (&quot;START.EXE&quot;, which the 
+FileName property would point at, would not be detected as a .NET binary.)
