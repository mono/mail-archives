 I had a patch that removed all abc on x [(byte) blob] where x is a
 readonly array. I will post it when I find it.

+
+&gt; ***** it seems strange (to me) that the range should be influenced
+&gt; by the constant 136629984 *******
+
+Oh my...
+This was unexpected!
+
+The ABC removal code is not &quot;type checked&quot;, in the sense that it does
+not check the types of local variables (or arguments, they are just
+like locals for me).
+Simply, if a &quot;new xxx [yyy]&quot; is assigned to a local, it is assumed to
+be an array of size &quot;yyy&quot;, but internally this is handled like assigning
+&quot;yyy&quot; to the *array*, like if it were an integer.
+Then, other integer variables and constants can be seen in the code, and
+in the end some relation between them and &quot;yyy&quot; can be found or deduced,
+and this is one way in which bound checks can be removed.
+The other way is if there's some conditional branch where the array
+length is part of the condition: this also gives some &quot;clue&quot; on the array
+size in all BBs dominated by the condition, and these clues, if they
+match with the array indexes, can be used to remove checks.
+Also in this case the whole array is handled internally like an integer
+whose value is the array size.
+
+The logic is that in ABC removal we are not interested in the array
+contents, only in the array length, and we must build a graph of relations
+between those lengths and the indexes used to access the arrays.
+If the graph is connected, and the relations are the ones we need, the
+ABC is removed, but in the process it seemed just easier to me to handle
+array just by their sizes, as it is those sizes that we put in the graph.
+
+The problem here is twofold: correctness and effectiveness.
+
+I put correctness first (even if this bug was on effectiveness).
+Those constants that are assigned to the local array are placeholders for
+the pointer to the actual array (which in this case is a static variable).
+The problem is, this confuses the ABC removal code, which thinks that the
+variable is an integer and that constant is its value (remember, the code
+does not check types, it assumes assignments are correct, after all the
+CIL should have been be checked before!).
+Later on, the *same* variable is handled like an array (which it is), and
+an element is accessed using one index.
+The code finds in the graph that a constant value has been assigned to
+the array, and it believes that's the array length, and tries to relate
+the index to the constant :-(
+
+I'm pretty sure you see the potential for an exploit here ;-)
+Just to play with it, I inserted this code (with no real meaning):
+
+------------------------------------------------------------------
+		// anyway it gets me (a little) further
+		
+		int k = sbox [12]; // access sbox with constant index
+
+		byte val = (byte)a;
+		int result = sbox [val] + k; // so that k is not dead
+------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+The bound check for 'sbox [12]' is removed, and will be as long as
+the constant used as index is less than the placeholder for the
+pointer to the static variable.
+Being wicker, I could have done a loop with an index from 0 to the
+array length (which is huge), and write all the array contents, which
+is a large part of the program address space!
+Of course this bug must be fixed, and to do this I must handle all
+variables according to their actual types.
+This way the &quot;placeholder assignment&quot; will be refused (in the sense
+of ignored), and the behavior will be the expected one.
+
+Which is not to remove *any* check in your example :-(
+And this brings us back to the bug you actually submitted, which is on the
+effectiveness of ABC removal (all the above is on the correctness of the
+produced code).
+
+
+The problem is that ABC removal simply does not look at type definitions
+at all. In theory, it *could* see that sbox comes from a static variable
+which is readonly, and check the array size statically... well, the local
+variable sbox would not be needed then, It would simply be that the ABC
+removal would be able to handle readonly static variables.
+
+In the beginning I did not think this was important for two reasons:
+- Their handling is useful if (and only if) they are readonly.
+  Otherwise they could be assigned at any time, so they cannot be tracked
+  by SSA (they could even be assigned by a different thread!).
+- Since without proper synchronization they are not thread safe, I didn't
+  think they were really important (synchronizing on a global array would
+  cost more than bound checks anyway IMHO).
+  Of course this doesn't apply if also the array *contents* were read
+  only, which seems to be the case here :-)
+
+
+Going on, this would not be enough to remove the checks.
+It would give the ABC removal code knowledge of the array length, but what
+about the indexes?
+Your SubByte_Int32 does not work because bitwise operations are ignored,
+in the sense that their result is assumed to be unknown (only simple
+arithmetical operations are handled).
+But SubByte_Byte is not more lucky: since ABC removal doesn't look at type
+definitions it just doesn't know that the value of 'val' is limited :-(
+
+All the above can be handled.
+
+When I'll make ABC removal &quot;type safe&quot;, I'll have code that checks all the
+types of local variable definitions. At that point it should be fairly
+easy
+to &quot;inject&quot; in the relation graph &quot;clipping ranges&quot; ('val' in your
+code would
+be from 0 to 255).
+And I could handle bitwise operations on *unsigned* values (or,
+better, with
+unsigned results), assuming that 'x &amp; constant &lt;= constant' and the
+reverse
+for '|'. Doing this for signed values is too risky (if you touch the sign
+bit the relations are reversed, it is hard to predict *statically*
+what will
+be the result of those operations), but this would be enough for your
+needs.
+
+Now I'll try to list the things to do in order of importance:
+
+[1] Make ABC removal look at actual variable types for correctness.
+[2] Use [1] to insert &quot;clipping ranges&quot; in the evaluation graph.
+[3] Still using [1], detect unsigned values, and enable handling of
+    bitwise operations between variables and constants.
+[4] Probably still using [1], detect when an array comes from a static
+    field, and if the field is readonly use the array length (since this
+    method is using the field, it *must* have been initialized, so we can
+    simply take the length of the array object for which the constant is
+    a placeholder).
+
+By the way, point [4] seems not compatible with AOT (at least not if we
+use the array object as I said above).
+The problem is that static fields are initialized by code (.cctor), so in
+principle at AOT compile time one cannot know the array length, even if in
+a case like yours looking at the source code it is obvious that the length
+is fixed.
+The problem is that in principle the .cctor can do what it wants, even
+give
+the array a length which depends from the moonphase.
+Calling monodis on your test program reveals that only an examination of
+the .cctor can give the definitive answer, but I doubt we want ABC removal
+to go that far ;-)
+
+
+About difficulty:
+Coding [2] and [3] is really easy.
+Coding [1] should also be fairly easy.
+About [4] I'm not sure (and in any case too hard with AOT).
+
+I put [4] last in order of importance because there are chances for the
+checks to be removed also without that point.
+I see that your SubByte_Int32 and SubByte_Byte are used in loops, and I
+guess they would be good candidates for inlining.
+When copyprop will work properly with SSA, inlining will be effective,
+and then if you code it like this:
+
+if (sbox.Length == 256) {
+	for (...) ...
+} else {
+	// Throw something, this should not be reached anyway
+}
+
+then the ABC removal code in the 'for' will know the length of sbox.
+At that point, even just [3] or [2] would be enough to have the checks
+removed... I know it's a workaround, but it would be easy (*and* it would
+also work with AOT).
+
+In the end, I'm going to implement [1], [2] and [3] as soon as I have
+some time, but I'd like so see some comment on the real usefullness of
+doing [4].
+
+
+&gt; I had a patch that removed all abc on x [(byte) blob] where x is a
+&gt; readonly array. I will post it when I find it.
+
+Yes, but... is it *safe*? (in the sense of &quot;correct&quot;)
+
+I suppose 'blob' is an int here, and the rationale is &quot;hey, '(byte) blob'&quot;
+is gonna be small, and in any case we're gonna just read from 'x', so
+let's
+skip the check&quot;.
+
+But what if the size of 'x' were smaller than '(byte) blob'?
+I guess your patch will just read a random value instead of throwing the
+required exception but I might have got it wrong.
+
+If your patch checked the actual array length, it would be very nice (but
+at that point I would not see the need for the cast to 'byte', since you
+know the real length you can just compare to that).
+But again, maybe I misunderstood it, maybe your patch checks the real
+length, and if it is &lt;= 256 *and* the index is a '(byte)' removes the
+check.
+This would be really useful, and a base on which [4] could be implemented
+very easily (again, AOT excluded).
