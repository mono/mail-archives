+Warning: Schema could not be validated. Class generation may fail or
+may produce incorrect results.
+
+Writing file
+'C:\cygwin\home\_\tests\xml\72231\eBayAPIInterfaceService.cs'.
+
+So MS generates &quot;incorrect results&quot; as they explicitly says. I could
+never be regarded as a valid WSDL.
