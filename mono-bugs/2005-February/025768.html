 The 'stupid' idea of asking oyu for more details is that doing what
 you say there everything works fine for me.

+By &quot;stupid things&quot; I am more refering to the way this system works.  
+Posting information and waiting for a reply as opposed to a more 
+favorable (in my opinion) real time interaction.  As I said before, I 
+cannot provide anymore information as is already posted.  This is not 
+my system, and from what I can tell, as no one else seems to have 
+this issue, if I were to personally set this up, I wouldn't be able 
+to reproduce this error either.  You asked for the page code, but it 
+doens't matter the specific code.  It could be something as small as 
+including an incorrect reference to an assembly in the web.config 
+file (which would result in a compile error).  After removing such an 
+entry, any pages previously accessed would still give the same error 
+(it shouldn't anymore) yet pages which weren't accessed before would 
+not have such errors.  Also, running XSP by itself does not produce 
+such errors. Since this is as much info as I can possibly provide, 
+and according to you, is not enough, there is no since in having this 
+bug open, and thus I just give up on it.
