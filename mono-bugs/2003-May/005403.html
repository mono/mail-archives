 webpage? What happens if you take the code in Page.Load and put it 
 into a regular, console based program? Are you able to access the 
 same SQL server with any of the mono tools? Does mono just freeze, or 
 does it take up CPU power?
 
 Can you find out exactally what part of your code is freezing it?

+OK, the Console.Writeline wasn't a good idea.  That was carried over 
+from the test program in C#.  I changed it to Response.Write, and 
+then the page didn't hang, but just did nothing.  I discovered that 
+the:
+
+Public void Page_Load()
+
+ that worked well with Microsoft didn't work with Mono.
+
+I looked at examples and changed it to:
+
+void Page_Load(object o, EventArgs e)
+
+and that got the function executing at start.  Apparently, it 
+igonored it before.  Now access to Sql works.  So, I traces all the 
+way back to my first problem, which was trying to databind the Sql 
+Server db to a DataList.  Presto, now it works. HooRay!  This 
+wouldn't work in Mono 0.23, so apparently something was fixed in 0.24 
+or the latest Mod_Mono (which I use).  So the only questions 
+remaining are why the Mono and MS code behaves differently, but I 
+don't really care much right now as long as I have it working.
