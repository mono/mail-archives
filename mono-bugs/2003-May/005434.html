 I am marking this as WONTFIX for now

+Oops - it looks like this (the first problem posted) isn't a bug after
+all. Looking at ECMA section 14.5.5.1, we get:
+
+&lt;quote&gt;
+The set of candidate methods for the method invocation is constructed.
+Starting with the set of methods associated with M, which were found
+by a previous member lookup (§14.3), the set is reduced to those
+methods that are applicable with respect to the argument list A. The
+set reduction consists of applying the following rules to each method
+T.N in the set, where T is the type in which the method N is declared:
+
+* If N is not applicable with respect to A (§14.4.2.1), then N is
+removed from the set.
+* If N is applicable with respect to A (§14.4.2.1), then all methods
+declared in a base type of T are removed from the set. 
+&lt;/quote&gt;
+
+The last bullet is the relevant one. Shame it's not more obvious
+elsewhere!
+
+Anyway, that draws the original bug to a close, I believe. Whether or
+not you want to emulate csc's broken (I still think) behaviour in the
+previous post I made, where the base class's method is overridden in
+the derived class and the *derived* version is removed, I don't know.
