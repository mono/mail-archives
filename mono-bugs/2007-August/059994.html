 reset on the client if not all the data has been read.

 Steven? You there? Any comment on the server not lingering?

+Hi Gonzalo,
+
+sorry for the delay - been a bit busy of late. I've just been looking
+at this again, since it was quite a while since I last did so. You're
+suggestion of a TCP reset being sent made me look a little closer at
+the tcpdump output and I noticed some additional information.
+
+Firstly, I don't think your suggestion of the server not lingering is
+what is happening. The code for the server (in the attached file)
+simply creates a socket and uses it in a very minimalistic way,
+without setting any specific options, so I imagine that it would have
+default TCP behaviour i.e. the closing socket will enter the time wait
+state and not necessarily terminate early.
+
+However, looking at the tcpdump output shows some interesting facts:
+
+1) When tcpdump is being run, the test code passes on a much more
+regular basis. It fails maybe 1 in 10 times (instead of about 9 in 10
+without tcpdump). Why? No idea presently.
+
+2) When the test fails, **all** of the data sent by the server is
+acknowledged by the client. Thus, the client IP stack has all of the
+data, but it gets discarded for some reason before it gets passed to
+the application code.
+
+3) When the test fails, after the last data ack from the client is
+sent, the handshaking for closing the connection begins. The server
+sends a FIN and, instead of responding with an ACK, the client
+responds with a RST. This clearly explains why the data that is being
+held in the client side IP stack is not being passed up to the
+application layer, but I don't know why the client would sent the RST.
+Is this potentially because the test program is such a short lived
+thing that it exits before the handshaking is complete? Because the
+process has finished, the host IP stack will then just abort any
+relevant outstanding TCP connections - I'm just hypothesising here.
+
+I'll modify my test to see if this is an issue and get back to you.
+
+Steven
