<PRE>Hi Ian,

Glade 3 was a complete rewrite and redesign of Glade, which happened a
long time before GTK+3 ever came out.

Glade 3.8 was the last version which supports GTK+2, Glade 3.8 is
*also* the last version which supports the libglade XML format, but
also has support for GtkBuilder format.

Later versions of Glade work exclusively with GTK+3 and have dropped
support for libglade.

Note that 3.8 and further releases, including current 3.20; are
parallel installable.

The older 3.8 Glade binary is installed as `glade-3`, and newer
versions which support GTK+3 installs the `glade` binary.

Distros have kept up for a while, but it's possible that Glade 3.8 has
been disappearing from distros; according to a quick web search, it
may be available in linux mint under the package name `glade-gtk2`

That said, if you have to build Glade 3.8 yourself, the dependencies
are not exorbitant so the process should be smooth, you would have to
install the `-dev` packages of GTK+-2 and it's dependencies; also
remember that Glade will not work without being installed somewhere
(it need not be configured into `/usr`, but it must be installed into
some prefix, `/opt` is fine).

Cheers,
    -Tristan
