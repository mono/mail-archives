<PRE>Folks:

  I am trying to build a basic application using GLADE.  The concept is
one of a speedometer for another code I have developed.  The coding is
done in perl.  I have all the modules installed correctly (as far as I
can tell).  I also have about 0 experience with Perl/Tk, Gtk, and Gnome
programming (which may be the issue).

  Ok, so I created my user interface with Glade (without specifying the
signals), saved it, generated the Perl code, built a trivial perl app to
call the display up.  It works, I get a display looking almost exactly
like what I want.

  The problem is how to hook into the call backs.  I am using the Gnome
Dial widget, and I would like to change the displayed value based upon a
variable I control.  So I figure that need to alter the signals in some
way.  Is this correct?   My widget is named speedometer.  So I figure
that the way to alter the value is something like

	app1-&gt;speedometer-&gt;value(\$speed);

or something similar...  Is this correct?  Part of the problem is my
naivete' on the vagaries of this style of programming.  I need to drive
the display not from mousebutton pressing events, but from programmatic
events (e.g. stuff coming out of a program).  So what I want to do is to
have 2 threads, one which updates the display by running the app1-&gt;run;
bit, and the other which inspects the things I want to display, and
places them into the correct variables.  

Any clues/examples would be quite welcome.  A usermanual, an example, a
tutorial would be wonderful.  

Thanks!

Joe
