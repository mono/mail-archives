Have you any suggestions on how Glade can provide such a service?  It
already provides lookup_widget() in support.c along with the code in
interface.c to make it easy to find a widget by name given a pointer to
any other widget in the same window.

We know that making everything global would be bad ... so this has to be
a decision made by the programmer, not by the builder.

I agree that code quality may not be as important as getting the job
done sooner.
