<PRE>Hi,

I am new to Glade, and was wondering if there was an easy way of
combining projects together into a &quot;Master&quot; project, or to create
sub-projects.

What I am trying to avoid, is the fact that Glade puts all your callback
routines in the single soure file &quot;src/callbacks.c&quot;, where what I would
really like is for the call backs for each toplevel window to have it's
own source file, otherwise, I can see my callback.c getting unmanageable
for big projects.

Does anybody know the implications of having say two or more projects
sharing the same base directory, (renaming the callback and interface
files), or how to link two projects together so that configure will pick
them both up?

Or maybe I'm going about this the wrong way?


Thanks in advance
Mark,.
