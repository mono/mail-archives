<PRE> Damon,

   My apologies; I already fixed this problem.  I thought that message
had gone out to the list, but it's possible it only went to Liam Quin,
with whom I was trading emails when I solved the problem.  I may not
have done a reply-all on that message.  Regardless, the problem is
fixed, and it was indeed what you seem to suspect.  I hadn't dropped
a viewport into the scrolled window before dropping the vbox that
contained the GUI in.  Live and learn...

best,
Jim Wiggs

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    I have a fairly complex input GUI that I've built, which consists of a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; top-level GtkVBox filled with a bunch of nested frames, vboxes, hboxes,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and assorted entry and button widgets.  The whole thing is supposed to go
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inside a page of a notebook, and to try to keep the overall size of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; window reasonable, I've nested it inside a scrolled window.  The problem
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is that the scrolled window doesn't &quot;scroll&quot;.  The vertical scrolling was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; set to &quot;Always&quot; and the horizontal to &quot;Automatic&quot; when I built the thing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in Glade, but when I compile and run the app, what I get is a scrolled
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; window which acts like it is showing all of its contents (the adjust bar
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is the same height as the window) but in fact only about half of the GUI
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is actually visible.  I have to expand the window in the y-direction to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get the entire GUI visible.  What's up?  The Glade-produced code for this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; window is several thousand lines, so I'm obviously not going to post it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unless it's absolutely necessary.  Given the information I *have*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; provided, can anyone suggest possible causes of this behavior?  I can post
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code snippets, etc., if requested...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you gzip the XML file and send it to me I'll have a look.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (You do have a GtkViewport inside the scrolled window, don't you?)
