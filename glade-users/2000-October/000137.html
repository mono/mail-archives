<PRE>To give a little background on what is going on in Archimedes, we are using
glade and libglade to provide users with ability to restructure the widget
layouts.  We are doing this by first using glade to build the widget and
libglade with libxml to parse .glade files on the fly.  The problem we have
noticed is: 

If in glade you have a toolbar, in which the buttons have both a
label and pixmap defined, the type isn't respected in libglade's generation
of the widget. Instead both the pixmaps and the labels are shown.

What this boils down to is that if you toggle the type in glade, the result
from libglade's parse is the same, the pixmaps and labels are both generated.

The only solution to this was to delete the pixmaps if you don't want them, or
vice versa for the labels.

Should this be on the other list?

Regards,

Chris
