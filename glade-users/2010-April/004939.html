<PRE>Please accept my deep apologies.

I really did try and say that I was not making a personal attack on 
anyone, but that I had deep regrets about a word being used incorrectly 
when there is a perfectly good word that could be used instead.

And yes, I have read the dictionary (in fact I looked in three paper 
dictionaries and two on-line ones).  But just because a word is in the 
dictionary does not mean it is a good word. Dictionaries are 
descriptive, not prescriptive: they tell you what people mean by a word, 
not whether it is a good word.

But I am upset that you are upset. I really did not mean to attack you 
in any way. I certainly don't think that I was &quot;spamming&quot; the list 
either. (From your source: &quot;spam&quot;  Unsolicited e-mail, often of a 
commercial nature, sent indiscriminately to multiple mailing lists, 
individuals, or newsgroups; junk e-mail.) I did not express myself well 
when I said that &quot;deprecate&quot; was restricted to the Open Source 
community. I meant that the OS community was where I had first 
encountered it.

So please put this down to an old man's intemperance and forgive me. 
(And please keep on using &quot;deprecate&quot; if you think that it is the best 
word. Once words escape there is no catching them again).

Bill
