If you plan on using a text file saved under windows, you will need to 
remove the extra CR characters. I use a little program called crlf, but 
you can even just write a sed script if you're up to it.

I am surprised that a programmer doesn't know this. Every C/C++ book I 
have goes over this subject in detail.
