If you select the toplevel windows, they have default width &amp; height
properties that you can set.

In GTK+ you try to avoid setting widget sizes explicitly, since if the
app is translated into another language (French/German etc.) the text
may not fit.

Instead, you usually set the width &amp; height properties of widgets that
you want to have a minimum size. You then set the default size of the
window.
