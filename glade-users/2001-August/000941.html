<PRE>I don't know how to get glade or gtk+ to fill the whole screen.  

On getting it to the same in glade as in execution, how are you picking 
the size of the window.  Are you using the width / hight settings under 
'Basic' tab in the properties window?

Make sure you are looing at the right size before you save the project. 
 Do this by right clicking on the window.  Go down to app1, or whatever 
you renamed it, and click on resize.

Hope this is the problem and thus the fix.

If the problem persist and no one else helps, you can send me the glade 
file, or some sample and I'll look at it.  I'm running glade 5.11.

As far as a book, there are only two I know of.  
-Benignning GTK+/Gnome Programming by Peter Wright published by Wrox. 
 Has a chapter with a glade tutor.  You build a calculator.  the book is 
well written.  My only complaint is that it is not released under the OPL.
-GTK+/Gnome Application Development, by Hovoc Pennington published by 
New Riders.  It is an experts guild.  It is under the OPL and I see 
Havoc posting all the time in the GTK+ mailiong list, which is another 
useful mailing list if your not on it.
