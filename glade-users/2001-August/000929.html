Yes, most containers like boxes and tables can do this.
But you have to use the packing options to get the layout you want.

For example you can use a table and make one widget 3 columns wide and
another one 5 columns wide, and it should divide up extra space between
them in those proportions.

 
&gt;<i> 2. Why the window size of a compiled/executed application is smaller than
</I>&gt;<i> the one created by Glade?
</I>&gt;<i> I use Glade to create a window with the full screen size but it appears
</I>&gt;<i> smaller after I compile and executed the application. I need to click the
</I>&gt;<i> full-screen button to explorer it.
</I>
You can set the default size of the window in the property editor.

If you hit Ctrl-R above a window, it should be resized to the size it
will appear when you compile it.

 
&gt;<i> 3. Does Glade support any database development?
</I>&gt;<i> All I need is to be able to store some records and retrieve them to/from a
</I>&gt;<i> table at this time. How to do it with Glade?
</I>
There is some support for GnomeDB, but you have to compile Glade with
 ./configure --enable-gnome-db to use this, and you have to have recent
versions of Glade and GnomeDB (possibly CVS versions even).

 
&gt;<i> 4. I installed Glademm and related c++ standard library. I run autogen.sh,
</I>&gt;<i> and system tells me missing macro files. I don't quite understand the
</I>&gt;<i> process. Can someone show me the steps to generate c++ code?
</I>
There is a separate list for C++ development. See the Gnome mailing
lists.
