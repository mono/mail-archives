<PRE>&gt;<i> There are a few layers I think where one can register for keyboard
</I>&gt;<i> events...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   - /sbin/init (/etc/inittab) owner of all terminals... responsable for 
</I>&gt;<i> calling
</I>&gt;<i>     a shutdown script when cntl-alt-del is hit
</I>&gt;<i>   - X server: I dont know how... but there is certainly a mechanism here to
</I>&gt;<i>     recieve all keyboard events from the running server (assuming it's 
</I>&gt;<i> console
</I>&gt;<i>     is currently active)
</I>&gt;<i>   - The window manager usually has mechanisms to map shortcuts to common
</I>&gt;<i>     window manager stuff (i.e. here you might make alt-F4 kill your 
</I>&gt;<i> focused application).
</I>&gt;<i>   - The X client application... usually an X client's place is to only 
</I>&gt;<i> recieve keyboard
</I>&gt;<i>     events that are sent to its X windows.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,

thanks for the help. but i was hoping for something more specific. i got to the
same point where i was &quot;guessing&quot; that it was either x11, or gnome itself
(window manager or nautilus or whatever), etc. the thing is that so far i
couln't find anything.
from what i gather there aren't any API on either GTK, or gnome that will
provide this, right?

A story: A man fires a rifle for many years; And he goes to war. And afterward he turns the rifle in at the armoury; And he believes he's finished with the rifle. But no matter what else he might do with his hands, love a woman, build a house, change his son's diaper; His hands still remember the rifle. -- Jarhead
