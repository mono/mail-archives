</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, what would be really nice... is if we could do the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; following:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    a.) We make a build of Glade 3.8 and 3.10 on win32 using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        Dieter's scripts (some builds exist already in the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        wild I think)... I cannot make any win32 builds myself.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3.8 binaries are linked on the bug report mentioned above.
</I>&gt;<i> These depend on the GTK+ version from ftp.gnome.org/www.gtk.org
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's a 3.8 version available on OBS that depends on everything
</I>&gt;<i> else also from OBS here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show?package=mingw32-glade3&amp;project=windows%3Amingw%3Awin32">https://build.opensuse.org/package/show?package=mingw32-glade3&amp;project=windows%3Amingw%3Awin32</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and an handy OBS download script is described here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-list/2011-May/msg00012.html">https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-list/2011-May/msg00012.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For 3.10, I'm also working on that. Building GTK+ 3 is easy
</I>&gt;<i> enough but it it porting PyGObject/gobject-introspection to
</I>&gt;<i> Windows that is taking time...
</I>
Right, we have that same problem on osx, currently gobject-introspection
does not build there.

However I think for now it's perfectly acceptable to dist win32/osx
binaries of Glade 3.10 with the python plugin disabled until the
gobject-introspection build eventually get's fixed.

Also... I wonder what exactly is the part where the 
gobject-introspection build breaks, perhaps an eventual
cross-compiler solution could be dished out to generate
girs for win32/osx from a normal linux box (maybe generating
the binary typelib for the gir should be built on a win32/osx
system using a gir file built on linux ?)... anyway, for 
now I'd rather say &quot;its not my problem&quot; and build 3.10 
without python where gobject-introspection doesnt build.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    b.) We get the same 3.8/3.10 builds out on native osx using 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        ige-mac-bundler, I can perhaps do this... maybe I could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        try building it and you could try my scripts to verify it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        works on more than one site...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    c.) We finally add the 'glade/build/win32'
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The script on the bug report assumes build/mswindows as sooner or
</I>&gt;<i> later the &quot;32&quot; in there is going to be irrelevant. Also that same
</I>&gt;<i> script should work fine to build 64 bit binaries by simply putting
</I>&gt;<i> mingw-w64's 64-bit producing toolchain on PATH before the 32-bit
</I>&gt;<i> producing mingw-w64 or mingw.org version. But I don't mind changing
</I>&gt;<i> it if you prefer win32.
</I>
I don't really care about the name so much.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and 'glade/build/osx'
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        subdirectories to glade's git repo, each subdir will have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        README file and some scripts to bundle/package up Glade on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        osx/win32
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    d.) In the future we hopefully have to worry less about getting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        builds out on various operating systems...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From what I've seen up until now, the amount of worry will mostly
</I>&gt;<i> depend on the amount of interest from some of Glade's dependencies
</I>&gt;<i> in platforms other than Linux...
</I>
The win32 binaries have always been in high demand, osx binaries I
suspect are less in demand probably because I never made a vast amount
of builds (only a few osx builds, and to my knowledge I'm the only one
who made any osx builds, however there have been lots of win32 builds
from the sf.net project <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gladewin32/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/gladewin32/</A>).

Anyway, having a standard build for this in tree will certainly make
things easier for anyone who wants to build on win32/osx and will
hopefully encourage the availability of Glade on those platforms.

Cheers,
       -Tristan
