Ok this conversation I think has gone a little far without a recap, its
hard to know what exactly it is you are trying to achieve as a
look'n'feel, and its propostorous to think that you could use a
GtkImageMenuItem in the place of a GtkButton, for the simple fact that
menu items go in menus and buttons go into normal containers.

However, I am sure that the layout you have in your artistic mind
can be expressed with gtk+ using the the right packing properties,
containers, alignments, frames etc in the right places - it may take
some getting used to but just consider that the reason we use all these
different containers is to get resize to work &quot;just so&quot; and prioritize
the right parts of your UI for expand/fill purposes alignment purposes
etc, maybe some ascii art or something could help enlighten us on what
exactly you want to achieve.

Cheers,
                -Tristan
