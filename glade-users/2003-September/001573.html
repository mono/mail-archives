<PRE>Hi,
    I'm working with glade and is stuck with a problem. When i execute
    the glade from the command prompt, the window pops up with an
    error, telling that

    &quot;An error occured while loading or saving configuration information
    for project1. Some of your configuration settings wont work properly.&quot;

    This problem was not there at first. This started when I was
    working on another project and tried to run the executable after
    excuting the autogen.sh and make. My Glade does not support &quot;Gettext
    Support&quot;, so i have to disable that in the Options Menu. When i
    executed the second project, i forgot to disable the Gettext
    Support option. Does this mean i have corrupted my glade
    configuration file? Why is my Project which i could properly execute,
    is not working properly now?

    I searched in the archive list, but couldnt find any answer. Can
    anyone please help me?

Regards,
    Reshmi.
