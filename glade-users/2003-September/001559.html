Yes, GNOME includes extra features which aren't in GTK+.


&gt;<i> 2) if yes, would a GTK application run in others platforms, such as KDE?
</I>
KDE and GNOME are completely different.
However, most Linux systems have both the KDE and GNOME libraries
installed so you can run KDE and GNOME applications.


&gt;<i> 3) a Glade application is a Gnome application?
</I>
You choose whether to create a GTK+ or GNOME application.


&gt;<i> 4) If I got it right on the above, is there an easy way to understand which are Gnome specific, and which are GTK functions?
</I>
The function name should tell you. If it starts with 'g_' 'pango_' or 'gtk_' you
can use it in a GTK+ app. If it starts with 'gnome_' you can't.

If you make sure you only link to the GTK+ libraries you will soon find out if
you've used GNOME functions as there will be an error when linking.
