<PRE>Hello, all,

I am documenting how to write a glade plugin, all while learning how to 
do so. This will result in a document hopefully helpful for other people 
wishing to do a similar thing later (documentation is scarce these days, 
at least for glade-3 plugins !).

For doing all this, I'll use a modified widget giving it an extra 
property : a dimension; not hard-coded 3x3, but modifyable between 2x2 
and 9x9. Also there is it's &quot;tictactoe&quot; signal on which it should be 
possible to assign a callback function by means of glade-3.

So up to now I adapted the original tictactoe widget (code available for 
those who are already now interested in having it) so that I have this 
modifyable dimension and it issues the &quot;tictactoe&quot; signal once there's a 
complete row or a complete column or a complete diagonal row.

I have also already adapted the xml file in the catalogs directory, as 
follows:

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;glade-catalog name=&quot;tictactoe&quot; library=&quot;gladetictactoe&quot; 
domain=&quot;glade-3&quot; book=&quot;tictactoe&quot;&gt;

  &lt;glade-widget-classes&gt;
    &lt;glade-widget-class name=&quot;Tictactoe&quot; title=&quot;Widget&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/glade-widget-classes&gt;

  &lt;glade-widget-group name=&quot;Custom&quot; title=&quot;Custom&quot;&gt;
    &lt;glade-widget-class-ref name=&quot;Tictactoe&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/glade-widget-group&gt;

&lt;/glade-catalog&gt;
My question is : what next ?

I hope that some(one) of the more experienced glade developers/users 
will be able to give some pointers or background information on the road 
ahead. I've had a hard time reading the code up to now (learning). 
Especially as I wasn't too familiar with GTK when starting, alltogether...

Kind regards,

PhB
</PRE>
