Yes, I even have a small demo app that demostrates doing this.  In fact
it goes further and loads both the interface *and* the behaviour
independently, dynamically @ runtime using libglade and gmodule. 
Unfortunately I'm at work, and the demo app is at home.  However the
basic approach is:

Create a GladeXML* from a given file, specifying the specific
dialog/container you wish to use.  Note you normally want to set the
windows in the .glade file as invisible and then explictly show them
when you're ready.  Load any required behaviour files using gmodule. 
Either configure the signals manually or call autoconnect (I haven't yet
needed to do this manually, I just call autoconnect myself :).  Extract
any required GtkWidget*'s from the GladeXML.  Set any
widget-data/global/file-static variables you need.

It should just work.

Well at least I haven't had to debug a static-GUI for a while, 'cause
for me it just works :).  [pity application logic can't be this easy.]

Anyway, this is the right list for the question.

For further documentation checkout the libglade reference in
developer.gnome.org.  (you might also want to check the glib doc's in
the same place for more info on gmodule).
