<PRE>I asked some time back about this, but did not provide detail so the
suggestion that the old glade code ported to libglade should &quot;just work&quot;
was mostly confirmation to me that something odd is going on as it does
not just work.

In case it is relevant:

  lib64glade2.0_0-2.6.0-1mdv2007.0
  glade2-2.12.1-3mdv2007.0

I wonder if window sizing must be done in a certain sequence... after
such-and-such call, but before this-or-that call?  I've tried moving
the code that does this, but have not had success yet.

I can confirm that the window sizing is saved properly, as I can code the 
saved sizes in the xml file directly to see that they match what I saved.
The only issue is re-applying the sizing on the next run.

Roughly, main.c contains in this sequence, and the main window is the only one
I'm trying to size at start.  This isn't all the code, but should be the
relevant calls.

  gtk_set_locale()
  gtk_init()
  dialog_xml = glade_xml_new(dialog_xml_path, NULL, NULL);
    // Don't care about sizing this one.
  window_xml = glade_xml_new(window_xml_path, NULL, NULL);
    // This is the one to resize.
  window_root = glade_xml_get_widget(window_xml, &quot;window_root&quot;);
  g_signal_connect()s
    // main window connections.
  gtk_window_set_geometry_hints(GTK_WINDOW(window_root), window_root, ...)
    // (non-useful for libglade as the xml hints minimums?)

Here the various panes, etc. of the window_root are initialized.
The calls here make many various calls to do so, including some
gtk_widget_show() for the window components.  Then, finally:

  gtk_widget_show(window_root)

load_window_positions(window_root) is what reads in the sizing.  It uses

  xml_tree = glade_get_widget_tree(GTK_WIDGET (window_root))

and have I tried code like the following, but nothing tried has succeeded:

  widget = glade_xml_get_widget(xml_tree, buf);
  gtk_window_move(GTK_WINDOW(widget), x, y);
  gtk_window_set_default_size (GTK_WINDOW(widget), w, h);
  // gtk_widget_set_size_request (window_root, w, h);
  // gdk_window_move_resize(GDK_WINDOW(window_root), x, y, w, h);

  widget = glade_xml_get_widget(xml_tree, buf);
  if (widget) {
    gtk_paned_set_position(GTK_PANED(widget), atoi(cp));
  }

I have tried placing load window positions several places to no avail.
Can anyone with more experience suggest an idea or two on what might
possibly be going wrong, or suggestions on what greater detail to
provide to enable said help?  The original glade project worked fine
with load_window_positions() immediately before the 
gtk_widget_show(window_root) call.

Thanks again for any input.
