</I>&gt;<i> absolute layout. Sigh...
</I>I'm not going to debate this :-) I have wanted to use X, Y layouts from
the beginning.  When I used to program in Java and hated how there was
no X, Y back in the day (I had to used Borland's own layout in JBuilder
1.0 and that was recomended only for prototyping).  All I can say is
that I have heard too many good arguments for why not to use X, Y
layouts and Gtk's layouts are dead simple compaired to Java.  If you
ever get the chance to read Havoc Pennington's thoughts on the subject,
do it.  He just makes sense.

&gt;<i> Re the druid, the only problem I have is being forced into looking like
</I>&gt;<i> gnome. Sometimes I do not want those cute arrows and crosses on my buttons.
</I>This is themable. 

&gt;<i> I do not like the little strip down the side. 
</I>You can change the color.
&gt;<i> I want the icon on the left,
</I>What can I tell you?  You have the source.  Inherit from the Druid or
copy and paste it into something that fits your needs.

&gt;<i> etc etc. Picky perhaps but that's how it is. Also, I wonder about the
</I>&gt;<i> performance of stuff that has been linked with gnome libraries; I may
</I>&gt;<i> speaking out of ignorance here
</I>Gnome is fast for me.  If it is slow for you then perhaps it is because of
your video card or, from what I gather, the fact that you may be using
depricated functionality in your port to 2.0.  I have also heard people
find that RedHat feels a bit sluggish compaired to some other distros
for some reason, but that could all be FUD.

Linking to Gnome does incure some overhead that say linking to Xlib
would not, but in return you get a better, more consistent interface,
unicode throughout, antialiasing, and baseline A11y for free.  If you
are a Java developer you might want to check out ATK from IBM or
Java-GTK/Java-Gnome.  You can use gcj (the Gnu Compiler for Java) to get
native code Gtk+ apps from Java.
