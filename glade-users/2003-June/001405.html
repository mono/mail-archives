<PRE>As a side note, I still couldn't get the gnome palette to work on my RedHat
9 box.

I installed the latest slackware last night, and glade-2 works like a charm.

Interesting....

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thank you, you have been more than useful. I had a feeling the gnome

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; re the X/Y, all us gui developers know they are eveil, but....sheesh,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sometimes I still like to use it. I guess I am still learning the GTK
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; layouts as opposed to Java, and sometimes I just cave in and use the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; absolute layout. Sigh...
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not going to debate this :-) I have wanted to use X, Y layouts from
</I>&gt;<i> the beginning.  When I used to program in Java and hated how there was
</I>&gt;<i> no X, Y back in the day (I had to used Borland's own layout in JBuilder
</I>&gt;<i> 1.0 and that was recomended only for prototyping).  All I can say is
</I>&gt;<i> that I have heard too many good arguments for why not to use X, Y
</I>&gt;<i> layouts and Gtk's layouts are dead simple compaired to Java.  If you
</I>&gt;<i> ever get the chance to read Havoc Pennington's thoughts on the subject,
</I>&gt;<i> do it.  He just makes sense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Re the druid, the only problem I have is being forced into looking like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gnome. Sometimes I do not want those cute arrows and crosses on my
</I>buttons.
&gt;<i> This is themable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I do not like the little strip down the side.
</I>&gt;<i> You can change the color.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I want the icon on the left,
</I>&gt;<i> What can I tell you?  You have the source.  Inherit from the Druid or
</I>&gt;<i> copy and paste it into something that fits your needs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; etc etc. Picky perhaps but that's how it is. Also, I wonder about the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; performance of stuff that has been linked with gnome libraries; I may
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; speaking out of ignorance here
</I>&gt;<i> Gnome is fast for me.  If it is slow for you then perhaps it is because of
</I>&gt;<i> your video card or, from what I gather, the fact that you may be using
</I>&gt;<i> depricated functionality in your port to 2.0.  I have also heard people
</I>&gt;<i> find that RedHat feels a bit sluggish compaired to some other distros
</I>&gt;<i> for some reason, but that could all be FUD.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Linking to Gnome does incure some overhead that say linking to Xlib
</I>&gt;<i> would not, but in return you get a better, more consistent interface,
</I>&gt;<i> unicode throughout, antialiasing, and baseline A11y for free.  If you
</I>&gt;<i> are a Java developer you might want to check out ATK from IBM or
</I>&gt;<i> Java-GTK/Java-Gnome.  You can use gcj (the Gnu Compiler for Java) to get
</I>&gt;<i> native code Gtk+ apps from Java.
