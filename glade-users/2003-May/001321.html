<PRE>Oops, sorry, I didnt answer your second question.

the answer is that in glade, you'll notice in a windows or widgets
options a button called &quot;Visible&quot; if you set that to true, it'll display
from the moment your app comes online, if you set it to false, you're
widget is invisible, which is exactly what you want your About dialog to
do.

So, select your about dialog window, set it's visible property to false
and when you run your app, it should be invisible until you show it.

Also, if you had read the libglade manual most of this would be obvious,
I'm helping you cause someone did this once for me and it helped me a
lot, especially when it came to learning more and gaining that critical
mass of knowledge I needed to learn for myself.  So get the libglade
manual and read it, you'll find how stupid you look and it'll do you no
end of good.  Thats what happened with me, it'll happen to you to.

</I>&gt;<i> libglade file to compile and run.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  When I start the program, the dialog box *always* starts with the 
</I>&gt;<i> program instead of only when I click the &quot;About&quot; button. When I cancel 
</I>&gt;<i> the dialog and click on the &quot;About&quot; button, it works just fine but how 
</I>&gt;<i> do I get it to not start up when I run the program?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for any pointers or files/web sites that anyone can direct me to.
