<PRE>Hi, 

this is a quick answer to your quesion, cause I'm on my way to work
right now.

in your example to create a treeview and be able to control it what you
have to remember is that glade can't really know what you want to put
into the treeview since it doesnt let you change that kind of
information, hoping it will in the future, cause that would be helpful. 
What it does do, is tree a blank treeview for you to retrieve from glade
using the function 

&quot;glade_xml_get_widget(xmlfile,&quot;WidgetName&quot;)&quot;

what I would do is this, take some treeview code you have got previously
either made by yourself or someone else, doesnt matter.

you'll notice they create a GtkTreeView *tree = gtk_tree_.... and
instead of creating a treeview in this piece of code, you simply
retrieve the already created treeview from glade using
glade_xml_get_widget(...)  Once you have replaced that one line of code
in your working treeview code with the line to retrieve the tree view
from glade, you should find your code will work ok.

it's a pain, I'm hopeful that glade 3.0 will have proper support for
treeviews and let me do all this code internally, but right now, this is
how you do it.

ok, so have fun and get coding.
