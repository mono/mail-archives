<PRE>hello,

I am designing an application in which i need  to include more than
one library in my application ..I have already included one of my
library in the application but when i try to include the other library
along with that library it kind of doesn't include the second
library....

Which is the way that i can included more than 1 external libraries in
my application....????

Thanks.

</PRE>
