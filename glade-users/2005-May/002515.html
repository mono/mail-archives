Yes; read the documentation of strncpy. The important detail: &quot;... the
destination string dest must be large enough to receive the copy.&quot;

It needs an allocated area to copy into, but you're giving it some
random uninitialized pointer rather than a pointer to some memory it's
allowed to scribble in, and as a result, it's scribbling on top of some
random spot in memory, causing a seg fault.

You should allocate an appropriately-sized chunk of memory (I guess in
this case, 7 chars since you only want the first 6 chars, and I assume
you still want it to be NULL-terminated)

So for instance:

char*
getcat  (GtkWidget *button)
{
        char *buffer;
        GtkWidget *entry_widget;
        gchar *string;

        entry_widget = lookup_widget(GTK_WIDGET(button),
&quot;comboboxentry1&quot;);
        string = gtk_combo_box_get_active_text(GTK_COMBO_BOX
(entry_widget));

        buffer = g_new0(char, 7);
        strncpy(buffer,string,6);

        return(buffer);
}

Of course, that means that whatever called getcat() is now responsible
for freeing this newly allocated string.

You should also probably look into why you're supposedly passing in some
&quot;button&quot; and then always looking up &quot;comboboxentry1&quot; (Your code also
doesn't show where your newly created comboboxentry gets registered so
that lookup_widget can find it, but that's presumably handled elsewhere,
otherwise you'll have OTHER issues when you try to call
gtk_combo_box_get_active_text on some invalid pointer; I swapped your
cast to GTK_COMBO_BOX(entry_widget) since that helps to catch things
like that)
