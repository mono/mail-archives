files but when I run make, they still get into the gladeui.def
and the make still fails.  How does the make still know about
these functions if I commented them in the .h header files?

</I>I see those two functions are in both the glade-signal-editor.h and .c
files but they are not in the gladeui.def.  Today I was trying to
figure out how that gladeui.def is generated but it is beyond me.

</I>I would be happy to do it if you don't mind a few e-mail messages
on this subject.  I can give the output and try corrective
suggestions.

At this point I have 2 questions

1. I can comment these four functions in their .h files
    but I don't know where else they are listed.  what else
    do I have to comment?
    glade_editor_hide_context_info
    glade_editor_show_context_info
    glade_project_is_loaded_factory_file
    glade_util_version_lesser_than

2.  What do I have to do so these two functions don't give &quot;undefined reference&quot;
     errors.  Should they appear in the gladeui.def file or any other file?
