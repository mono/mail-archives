No idea how this works (well I kind of have but....), but try the
following:

   GtkWidget        *label;
    GList            *glist;


  widget = lookup_widget(window_widget_is_on, &quot;slider_button&quot;); /* may not
need this as long as you have a pointer to the widget you'll be okay*/

    glist = gtk_container_children( GTK_CONTAINER(widget) );
   label = GTK_WIDGET( glist-&gt;data );
    gtk_label_set( GTK_LABEL(label), &quot;FRED&quot;);

I found this after trawling through stacks of stuff on the web, all seemed
a bit mysterious to me, as I too had similar problems in setting/changing
the label for the button.
I found the answer in a posting from 1998 from someone complaining about
the lack of useful documentation....
yet I still find myself wandering how the hell did they know to A) use a
GList, and B) that is has a member called data.  Half the time the
documentation states that the structure should only be accessed using the
functions given...  which in turn can only be used with this &quot;extra&quot;
knowledge.
I realise this is more of a GTK problem than glade specific, but I'm sure
there are many other relative &quot;newbies&quot; like myself who feel slightly lost
at times.

Jered.
