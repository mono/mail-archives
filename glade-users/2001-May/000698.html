<PRE>Hello again, folks.  Thanks for answering my last question, Damon.  Now
I have read a lot more, played with Glade a lot, and of course have
uncovered more questions.  Actually, I believe I have uncovered one of
the fundamental truths of the universe:  In the universe as a whole,
there really are more questions than answers. :-)

If I use glade_xml_signal_autoconnect(), will I get the data that I
specified when I defined that signal?  How, like, could someone give me
a brief, understandable example?

Or, if the answer is that that function won't get it, would I first run
that function anyway to connect what it can connect, and then use
glade_xml_signal_connect_data() to reconnect each one that I need the
data from?

I have it in mind to have in my program an initialization section which
will use glade_xml_get_widget() and glade_xml_get_widget_prefix() to get
all the objects which my program has to interact with.  These objects
will come in as GtkWidget*, and then I'll cast them to, for example,
GtkButton by using the GTK_BUTTON macro, right?  Then I could interract
with the widget via the regular GTK function calls?

Thanks in advance,
Ed
