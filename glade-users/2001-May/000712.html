You can only use lookup_widget() to get a pointer to a widget within
the same window, e.g. the same window that 'button' is in in your code above.

To get pointers to widgets in other windows the FAQ may help a bit:

4.6 How do I get a pointer to a widget in another window?

You need to keep track of pointers to all your toplevel windows.
For simple applications you can just use global variables to store these
pointers.

For more complicated applications you can use the gtk_object_set_data() and
related functions to store a pointer to one window inside another window.
For example, if you want to create a dialog which needs to access widgets in
the main window you can do this:

  dialog = create_dialog1 ();  /* Call the function generated by Glade. */
  gtk_object_set_data (GTK_OBJECT (dialog), &quot;main_window&quot;, main_window);

Then when you need to access the main window from within the dialog code,
you can do this:

  main_window = gtk_object_get_data (GTK_OBJECT (dialog), &quot;main_window&quot;);

NOTE: You need to be careful to ensure that the pointer is always valid.
If the window being pointed to is destroyed, make sure you no longer use the
pointer to it or your application may crash.
