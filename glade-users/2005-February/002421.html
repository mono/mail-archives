1.1.3 is almost the same as 2.0.1, except for a few bug fixes I think.
Though it is possible that one has been compiled with GNOME support and
the other hasn't. (Do they both have &quot;GNOME&quot; pages on the palette?)


&gt;<i> Does anyone have any ideas how I can:

</I>
Try getting a stack trace. See:
  <A HREF="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/getting-traces.cgi">http://bugzilla.gnome.org/getting-traces.cgi</A>

&gt;<i> - If this is a glade file from the earlier version, can I upgrade the
</I>&gt;<i> glade file?
</I>
You could try getting Glade 2.0.2 and compiling it yourself.
  <A HREF="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/glade/2.0/">http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/glade/2.0/</A>

The file format is the same for 1.1.3 and 2.0.1.

It did change slightly for 2.6.0 (mainly toolbars), but you probably
don't want to use that anyway as it requires GTK+ 2.4/GNOME 2.6.
