Thanks. Now I have the same problem that someone else mentioned.
I can't load those files in Glade because they're .png files,
not .xpm files. I have Glade built without Gnome support, because
I haven't been able to get gnome-libs to build due to missing
libraries. (Do you know where I can find libdb1?)

If I can get gnome-libs built and rebuild Glade with gnome
support, will that allow me to use .png files? Or do I have
to build the entire gnome desktop (which I don't need)?

Thank you very much for your help.

Regards,
Dean
