Glade has a small FAQ at <A HREF="http://glade.pn.org">http://glade.pn.org</A>

 
&gt;<i> I was asked to find out why someone's code which built and ran under

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then I started merging back the changes they had made to main.c.
</I>&gt;<i> When I reintroduced XInitThreads() the program stopped working.
</I>&gt;<i> I've learned they added this to make their X Windows calls thread safe,
</I>&gt;<i> and that it worked under RH 6.2.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is this a known problem with RH 7.0?  Any work arounds?
</I>
RH 7.0 has XFree86 4.0.1 which is known to be a bit buggy, so that may
be the problem.

But it is a bit unusual to call XInitThreads in a GTK+ program.
Do they really need to do that? GTK+ has its own exclusive lock that most
threaded apps use - i.e. GDK_THREADS_ENTER()/GDK_THREADS_LEAVE().
