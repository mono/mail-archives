Hi Juan,
   I don't think it's a good idea at all to &quot;chop&quot; the menubar/toolbar off the
way you did (it looks so unnatural and it's so non-standard that I can't
agree with it) *but* perhaps something can be salvaged from this...

One thing that I find interesting about this experiment is that, perhaps
it could be nice to place the &lt;search widgets&gt; entry in the toolbar aligned
to the right hand side (this would save vertical space from the inspector &amp;
property editor zone without creating this really weird interface, also it
would be a natural place to put the search entry I think, similar to firefoxes
search entry and not so far off from where Glade originally had it).

Also, I still really don't like what you've done to the &quot;Docs&quot; and &quot;Clear&quot;
buttons, they should really be implemented as contextual &quot;actions&quot;
and automatically appear in the context menu (as the Docs already
does) or optionally in the toolbar (perhaps the &quot;Docs&quot; button should
also appear in the toolbar).

I think that we can remove the &quot;Clear&quot; button completely, I think
I recall Vincent Geddes arguing the same thing; the &quot;Clear&quot; button
is probably never used.

So I would prescribe:
  a.) Remove the &quot;Clear&quot; button altogether
  b.) Make sure the &quot;Read Documentation&quot; feature is implemented
       as an action, and make it &quot;important&quot; so that it also shows
       up in the toolbar.

Cheers,
                -Tristan
