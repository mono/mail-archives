</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But now I am playing a little bit more and choose a somewhat unorthodox
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; layout for the UI I basically took out the inspector/property editor out
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the hierarchy and put it on a side so that it can take the whole
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; vertical space of the window (no more wasted space by the menu and tool
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bar)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I must say it looks odd at the beginning but after a few minutes it gets
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; better :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What do you guys think?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi Juan,
</I>&gt;<i>    I don't think it's a good idea at all to &quot;chop&quot; the menubar/toolbar off the
</I>&gt;<i> way you did (it looks so unnatural and it's so non-standard that I can't
</I>&gt;<i> agree with it) *but* perhaps something can be salvaged from this...
</I>
Yeah I know I would not either, I was just playing and wanted to share
it. I got to tell that having the UI made with glade makes it very easy
to play with it! heheh but what I was trying to do was move the status
bar under the workspace, but that also looks bad.

&gt;<i> One thing that I find interesting about this experiment is that, perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> it could be nice to place the &lt;search widgets&gt; entry in the toolbar aligned
</I>&gt;<i> to the right hand side (this would save vertical space from the inspector &amp;
</I>
Yes that would be good!

&gt;<i> property editor zone without creating this really weird interface, also it
</I>&gt;<i> would be a natural place to put the search entry I think, similar to firefoxes
</I>&gt;<i> search entry and not so far off from where Glade originally had it).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I still really don't like what you've done to the &quot;Docs&quot; and &quot;Clear&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> buttons, they should really be implemented as contextual &quot;actions&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and automatically appear in the context menu (as the Docs already
</I>&gt;<i> does) or optionally in the toolbar (perhaps the &quot;Docs&quot; button should
</I>&gt;<i> also appear in the toolbar).
</I>
Well you can set the default value from the property editor contextual
menu, but adding a clear properties context menu item sounds even better
than adding an item to the toolbar.

&gt;<i> I think that we can remove the &quot;Clear&quot; button completely, I think
</I>&gt;<i> I recall Vincent Geddes arguing the same thing; the &quot;Clear&quot; button
</I>&gt;<i> is probably never used.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I would prescribe:
</I>&gt;<i>   a.) Remove the &quot;Clear&quot; button altogether
</I>&gt;<i>   b.) Make sure the &quot;Read Documentation&quot; feature is implemented
</I>&gt;<i>        as an action, and make it &quot;important&quot; so that it also shows
</I>&gt;<i>        up in the toolbar.
</I>
Yup, sounds good!

greets

JP
