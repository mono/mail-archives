<PRE>Hi the list,

Sorry if my question is trivial --at least, it does not look like FAQ.

I'm trying to resurrect an abandonware written in Perl, and using Glade 
through libglade-perl. If I understand correctly, the soft is supposed 
to load dynamically the UI, coded into xml files. Even if it's not clear 
from the (partial) doc of this soft, it appears to require (very) old 
versions of libgtk, libglade, etc. as well as their *-perl equivalent. I 
struggled quite a bit to install that on a recent Ubuntu (I had to use 
old Debian repositories because of version conflicts), but I eventually 
managed to launch the Perl script... not very successfully, since it 
crashed with annoying **Warning...** messages, indicated that some 
widgets were not found. And here I am.

Google was not very friendly this time, and provided me with two tracks:
* The format of the XML files generated by Glade occurred to change in 
the past, the error might then come from these files.
* I also have to install weird-named packages like libgnome0, etc. from 
Debian Sarge, which depends on xfree, and which will very probably 
destroy my brand-new Ubuntu.

I would be glad to get any piece of advice. According to your 
experience, what is the most promising way to solve this kind of issue?
* Everything should work with libgtk and libglade packages from various 
repositories, and the problem comes from the distribution and not from 
any Glade component
* Glade 1.0 and Gtk 1.0 are no longer supported and won't work properly 
in the future, the soft must be updated (Glade 3.0, Gtk2)
* The XML files called *.glade are internal components of Glade and I 
should not expect them to keep the same syntax for so long (and then, 
update them, and how?)
* Other?

Thanks in advance,

Arnaud.
</PRE>
