&gt;<i> I didn't take the time to go through the whole tutorial but

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Widget name is used because the file continues to be a valid glade file
and can be edited through glade.
It would be nice to have somewhere to enter arbitrary properties and
values. Then it would be added as
&lt;property name=&quot;myprop&quot;&gt;myval&lt;/property&gt;
in the glade XML file.
&gt;<i> Another thing, have you considered writing this code somehow
</I>&gt;<i> as a plugin to glade ? or maybe a plugin to anjuta that can
</I>&gt;<i> interface with the glade core ?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Yes, this is an alternative. But don't forget that autoglade &quot;is&quot; the
application (or the module imported in some cases), not to be run as
part of the designer.
i.e: $ autoglade myapp.glade
Am I missing something ?
&gt;<i> Excuse me here I'm going to run off on a tangent but you
</I>&gt;<i> might want to indulge with me ;-) ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wonder if this task could be done simply by defining objects 
</I>&gt;<i> that control what to do with entries and inputs, this way 
</I>&gt;<i> the objects could be added to the xml output of glade, the
</I>&gt;<i> resulting program would remain language independent and
</I>&gt;<i> you'd just need to have your library of &quot;input controlling
</I>&gt;<i> objects&quot; installed on the target system for it to run
</I>&gt;<i> (those object's parameters would replace the auto/init/extra
</I>&gt;<i> params you outlined and would contain the needed code
</I>&gt;<i> to do the appropriate things in the resulting runtime).
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Yep, would be nice, but much harder to implement I think.
Currently, autoglade can invoke any method almost with any arbitrary
list of parameters (widget:auto:method:params).
&gt;<i> A simple similar idea thats been floating around that would be
</I>&gt;<i> useful and might also integrate well with your work is a
</I>&gt;<i> state machine plugin, basically you would have your GObject
</I>&gt;<i> based &quot;state&quot; objects with callbacks for state initializers,
</I>&gt;<i> cleanups and transitions and predefined links from one state
</I>&gt;<i> to another or from state back to superstate, or to substate
</I>&gt;<i> (all of these links interestingly could be setup using a GUI
</I>&gt;<i> that could be part of the state machine plugin and work seemlessly
</I>&gt;<i> with glade as if the state objects were actually widgets)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ofcourse, state transitions could also be triggered by widget
</I>&gt;<i> events or GtkAction activations, a simple state_machine_run_action()
</I>&gt;<i> could be setup as a callback for any GtkAction, the GtkAction
</I>&gt;<i> itself could have an attribute telling the state machine in which
</I>&gt;<i> state it should transition to.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Very interesting idea indeed.
&gt;<i> Anyway, these are just a couple ideas that I think could
</I>&gt;<i> go a long way, I'm glad to see that people are doing work
</I>&gt;<i> towards really automating the application writing procedure :)
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>autoglade target, at this stage, is to simplify (or to eliminate in some
cases) the development of simple applications, mainly to give a command
line tool a GUI.
One of the most representative examples is described in the tutorial
(rdc, a GUI for rdesktop).
In about 100 lines of bash scripting, plus the glade definition plus
autoglade you have a &quot;real&quot; application comparable in functionality with
Microsoft's client or tsclient (~ 5K lines of C code).
Any ideas are welcome.


Again, thanks for your comments.
