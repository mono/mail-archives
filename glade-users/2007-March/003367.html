When I said that you could add your widget &quot;easily enough&quot; using
a catalog you made a sarcastic remark that 
&quot;card tricks were easy too&quot;, I suppose you were insinuating that
my suggestion was proposterous seeing that there is no prestine
documentation, I'm sorry but that was rude and that kind
of comment is not welcome, I went on to point you in the direction
of the existing catalogs as examples and you continued with
your sarcastic remark about &quot;... and then ?&quot; ... as if it were
also proposterous to expect you to go and read those files and
figure how they are integrated, more unwelcome sarcasm thankyou.

I can see you are making an effort to be nice though, I'd be
happy to answer any straight questions you have but please 
no more sarcasm.

Cheers,
              -Tristan
