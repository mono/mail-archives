There is currently a bug in glade-3 that causes it to drop custom images 
from menus and things. I'm using glade-3.0.3, which seems to be the 
latest version I can use without mangling all my projects.

&gt;<i> I'd like to change the color of the tool bar, but am unable to see how

You probably want to do this with a gtk theme. Changing the colours of 
things is generally frowned upon because it doesn't play well with themes.

&gt;<i> I need to incorporate something like gtkhtml2 into my project.  (My 
</I>&gt;<i> installation of Ruby-Gnome2 failed to install gtkmozembed.)  I tried to 
</I>&gt;<i> install the GTK Widget Factory so that I might make gtkhtml2 into a 
</I>&gt;<i> Glade widget, but it appears to be incomplete.  The &quot;configure&quot; failed 
</I>&gt;<i> at libtool, but I don't know how to make it work.  Perhaps I should ask 
</I>&gt;<i> how to incorporate gtkhtml2 into the code that will be generated by 
</I>&gt;<i> libglade.
</I>&gt;<i>

Can't help you with this one. Sorry.
