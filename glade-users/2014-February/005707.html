<PRE>Hi,
  thank you for replying, and sorry for the lack of information, I've
solved the problem of the values not displaying and it had nothing to do
with glade itself.

  What I'm doing is to set a fake property to store a list of pairs of
strings in the glade files and then load them in a internal structure of
the buildable object this property belongs to. To set this list, I've
declared the fake property as a GtkListStore (with two columns), so it can
be used both for storing the property in the glade plugin until it is
written to the UI definition of my object, and also as a model of the
GtkTreeView used as input of the property for the user to set those pairs
of strings. So the value of the property is an object (a GtkListStore), but
the values I actually need are the contents of this object, which are then
written to the XML inside a set of custom tags. All this is working right
now.

  The problem I had was that the values set in the GtkListStore through the
GtkTreeView were not showing, but it was just because I made a mistake when
defining the GtkCellRenderers, and I wasn't paying attention to it due to
the warning shown by Glade while setting the value of the property itself.

  The warning is still showing when I set the value of the property (the
GtkListStore) using the glade_command family of functions but the undo/redo
is working. This is the only thing left to fix in the plugin. These are the
warnings shown when:
     - using glade_command_set_property or glade_command_set_property_value
with a value for the property:
      (glade:5091): GladeUI-CRITICAL **: Object type property refers to an
object outside the project
      (glade:5091): GladeUI-CRITICAL **: glade_property_update_prop_refs:
assertion `gnew != NULL' failed

     - using glade_command_set_property or glade_command_set_property_value
with NULL (to unset the value):
      (glade:5091): GladeUI-CRITICAL **: glade_property_update_prop_refs:
assertion `gold != NULL' failed

  The second and third messages are also emitted when using the
glade_property_set and glade_property_set_value functions.

  If you need more information about anything, let me know and I'll try to
provide it. Thanks.

  Regards.
