<PRE>Damon,

Appreciate your response. The glib I was using was in the package
GTK+/Win32 dev env Installer 2.4-rc25, and I think the version was glib
2.4.8. The images.c source code was in the directory
C:\GTK\share\gtk-2.0\demo after installation. I also modified the source
program main.c and demos.h to exclude other part of the demo (because it
calls a bunch of other programs that I didn't need). These two files
plus demo-common.h are from the source pkg of gtk+2.6 that was
separately downloaded from <A HREF="http://www.gtk.org/download/.">http://www.gtk.org/download/.</A>

I will try GTK+2.4.9 to find out how the demo use g_fopen(), while I
wait the release of glib 2.5.4.=20

Thank you!
Fanz

g_fopen() was only added to GLib recently. It is in GLib 2.5.4, which is
a beta release, not a stable release.

Where did you get the demo program from? Download an older stable
version of GTK+, e.g. 2.4.9, and try the demo from there.
