<PRE>With a bit of work and a lot of help from the gtk-list and this list, I 
have been able to get a working development environment in Windows using
MinGW, msys, gtk bundle and building a few packages including
Glade3-3.4.5.  I am now able to build a simple libglademm app.  The one
problem I cannot solve yet is the font size.

I first experimented with the pre-built gtk and glade from
<A HREF="http://gladewin32.sourceforge.net/">http://gladewin32.sourceforge.net/</A> and I built a test libglademm
app with that.  Now that I have started with the gtk bundle from
<A HREF="http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html">http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html</A>
any app I build whether plain gtk, libglade or libglademm has font that
is larger than it was when I built the same app with the gladewin32
setup.  Even the Glade that I built has the large font.  I searched the
archives of the gtk and this list.  The gtk list had some old ones that
were mostly unanswered.

Why is the font large?  Am I correct in guessing that I am probably
missing some package that is needed to handle the font correctly?
