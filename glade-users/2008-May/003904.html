<PRE>Ok, first of all, I wouldnt officially say there is support for saving
in builder format
from glade, 3.5.x is the development series and I think we still have
3 good months
before a stable release. Albeit, initial support is there and some
glade files may
work.

&gt;<i> Ultimately, I'm looking for known issues and status with saving to

</I>
I am hoping that gtk-builder-convert can be made completely
obsolete by the time we release Glade 3.6, I also dont want to encourage
people to use libglade so I would say I personally would rather not see
another tutorial about libglade, but that is up to you.

&gt;<i> In either case, I would like to provide my readers with explanations as
</I>&gt;<i> much as I can and point them in the right direction to following the
</I>&gt;<i> status (related bug reports).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm using Glade 3.5.2, GTK+ 2.12.19, and Libglade 2.6.2 (using Python).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First, neither LibGlade nor GtkBuilder seem to like the &lt;requires&gt; tag
</I>&gt;<i> at the top of the file. I can't seem to find information on that. Is
</I>&gt;<i> that something that Libglade and GtkBuilder are going to support in the
</I>&gt;<i> future?
</I>
Libglade invented the &lt;requires&gt; tag, for purposes or requiring libglade modules
such as the libgnomeui module - I was under the impression that libglade was
not going to complain if I added a version=&quot;2.4&quot; in the requires tag -
I also used
a separate tag to depict the required version of gtk+ specifically, since I knew
libglade would choke on that.

But anyway, we will have to change the way we save this data at least for
target versions of gtk+ &lt;= 2.14 and probably be saving this info as comments,
since gtkbuilder also doesnt like unrecognized tags.

Also, if the required version tags dont work in libglade (dont they
?), please at least _file bugs_.
(can you believe were talking about documenting bugs in a tutorial,
but the developers were
not even notified that those bugs exist ? *cough*communication breakdown*cough*)

&gt;<i> When saving as GtkBuilder, after deleting the requires tag, GtkMenuBar
</I>&gt;<i> widgets always seem to crash. Even when dropping a GtkMenuBar into a
</I>&gt;<i> GtkWindow without any other widgets, it crashes:
</I>
I have a series of patches to gtk+ pending for GtkMenu/GtkMenuItem support
(i.e. better construct property handling etc.), but I stalled on this
- I'm not sure
how much time I will have in this release cycle, there is a chance we
wont support
native GtkMenu structuring in this round, and try to only get
GtkUIManager running
instead.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;GtkWarning: Attempting to add a widget with type GtkMenu to a container

</I>&gt;<i> type GtkWindow, the GTK+ FAQ at <A HREF="http://www.gtk.org/faq/">http://www.gtk.org/faq/</A> explains how to

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When taking that same file but saved as a Libglade file and running

</I>
Sounds like an awful lot of effort spent to document an unfinished
work, I really
wish people would spend this much effort to help finish the work.

Cheers,
                       -Tristan
