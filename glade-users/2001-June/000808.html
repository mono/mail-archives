Maybe you could connect to the &quot;value_changed&quot; signals of the scrollbars'
adjustments.

This may help from the FAQ:

4.9 How do I connect to GtkAdjustment signals?

Glade doesn't support this at present, but you can set it up manually, in a
similar way to question 3.6.

When you create the window, get a pointer to the widget containing the
adjustment, and connect to the &quot;changed&quot; or &quot;value_changed&quot; signals:

  window1 = create_window1 ();
  hscale = lookup_widget (window1, &quot;hscale1&quot;);
  gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (GTK_RANGE (hscale)-&gt;adjustment),
                      &quot;changed&quot;, GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (on_adjustment_changed),
                      NULL);
