Hmmm,
    maybe you should check this out with the gtkmm people; I dont
know if there is a list, optionaly; you might want to ask about
this on <A HREF="mailto:gtk-app-devel-list@gnome.org.">gtk-app-devel-list@gnome.org.</A>

I'm not sure how gtkmm handles casting; in the above example
(in the api docs) it simply says &quot;widget-&gt;window&quot;, this only
works because widget is a &quot;GtkWidget *&quot; (or a GtkDrawingArea
which was /cast/ to a GtkWidget).

What happens in c++ when a parent class has a class member
with the same name as a class member in a child implementation
of the said class ? does it not compile ?

With GObject, it is perfectly OK for a `struct _GtkWidget' to have
a `-&gt;window' member and a child implementation to also have a
`-&gt;window' member; although these wouldn't be the same element at
all.
i.e. GTK_WIDGET (darea)-&gt;window != GTK_DRAWINGAREA (darea)-&gt;window.

Cheers,
                            -Tristan
