<PRE>&gt;<i> IIRC, with glade-2 or the original glade; you would treat this as
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;custom widget&quot;, you'd add it to your project and use a few generic
</I>&gt;<i> parameters (int 1, int 2, string 1, string 2) and a &quot;create function&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> to be looked up in the program by libglade.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I always used &quot;string 1&quot; to be the name of an xml file that I would
</I>&gt;<i> parse in my create_function() (but that's unimportant).
</I>
That sounds about right. I have the custom widget in the project that
seems to be compiling correctly. The only part that I don't have
working is the basing of this custom class on the Drawing Area object.

For example, I have a class called &quot;Scope&quot;, which should be based on
drawing area:

Scope::Scope() : Gtk::DrawingArea()

However, in a bit of example code, I get an error that Scope doesn't
have the window member that it should have (if it has inherited it
from DrawingArea):

Scope.cc:41: `class Scope' has no member named `window'

(from within the Scope member function, I was trying to access
this-&gt;window similar to the example on
<A HREF="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gtk/GtkDrawingArea.html">http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gtk/GtkDrawingArea.html</A>)

&gt;<i> Note also that GtkDrawingArea is just a simple GtkWidget with its
</I>&gt;<i> own GdkWindow, the DrawingArea does *not* implement any &quot;draw_line&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> method or whatnot; it is the responsability of the DrawingArea user
</I>&gt;<i> to trap the &quot;expose-event&quot; signal and draw to GTK_WIDGET (darea)-&gt;window
</I>&gt;<i> using the GdkDrawable API.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
Oops. Yeah, that's what I meant. I think gtkmm is done up in such a
way that you can use drawable-&gt;drawing_primative_function(); as if it
is an actual member. It's been a few weeks since I last worked on
this, so I forget what I've aready tried.
