Ok,
    I promise that I'll write up &quot;adding-widgets.txt&quot; properly
this week. (there, now I dont have a choice ;-D )

&gt;<i> I was however forced to checkout the CVS stuff to see it. The latest snap-shot

</I>
Ah well sorry about that; I'm planning on makeing a release as soon
as Juan's work on the menubar-editor stablizes (and we're very very
close to that so it should be soon).

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>I assume that I somehow need to build a library hold the functionality of my
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>new widgets.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>This library typicly will only provide support for non-standard object

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>are not GtkWidget or GtkContainer; or if you have parameters to implement
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>that are not implemented via GParamSpec/g_object_install_property.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But any derived widgets needs to be put away in a library anyway, so that
</I>&gt;<i> glade-3 can display them, right?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know I will add new events for instance.
</I>
Ah well, it can be done like that too; actually its probably
a good idea, but you can also build a support module that
only links to the library actually contains the said widgets.

IOW, you dont /have/ to distribute the glade plugin support with
the app that needs your custom derived widgets (but glade-3 /does/
need to at least /see/ the actual objects).

[...]
&gt;<i> Anyway, my resulting conclusion is that libglade and glade-3 is certainly
</I>&gt;<i> giving me the oppertunity to do what I wished to do and it is all there plus
</I>&gt;<i> minus some teething. There is still some questions regarding the real hows on
</I>&gt;<i> the nitty gritty (documentation should solve this), but it should be capable of
</I>&gt;<i> doing it.
</I>
Hmmm,
      I should also get API docs generated; since glade-3 provides
an API not only for plugin writers but also for IDE writers theres
been alot documentation written into function headers; worth checking
out...

Cheers,
                         -Tristan
