<PRE>Hi,

I'm trying to install glade2 on RH7.3
I've successfully installed the gtk+2.0 libraries.

However when I try to install glade2
using
rpm -i glade2-1.1.3-3.i386.rpm
I get:
    error: failed dependencies:
    gail-devel &gt;= 0.17 is needed by glade2-1.1.3-3
    libc.so.6(GLIBC_2.3)   is needed by glade2-1.1.3-3

However when I try to install gail, I get:
        gtk2 &gt;= 2.2.0 is needed by gail-1.2.0-1
and when I try to install
    rpm -i gtk2-2.2.2-2.1.i386.rpm I get:
error: failed dependencies:
        glib2 &gt;= 2.2.0-1 is needed by gtk2-2.2.2-2.1
        libXft.so.2   is needed by gtk2-2.2.2-2.1
        libXrandr.so.2   is needed by gtk2-2.2.2-2.1
        libc.so.6(GLIBC_2.3)   is needed by gtk2-2.2.2-2.1
        libfontconfig.so.1   is needed by gtk2-2.2.2-2.1
        libpng12.so.0   is needed by gtk2-2.2.2-2.1
        pango &gt;= 1.2.0-3 is needed by gtk2-2.2.2-2.1

and when I try:
    rpm -i glib2-2.2.2-1.i386.rpm

I get
error: failed dependencies:
        libc.so.6(GLIBC_2.3)   is needed by glib2-2.2.2-1
        libpthread.so.0(GLIBC_2.3.2)   is needed by glib2-2.2.2-1

However someone told me that GLIBC_2.3 cannot be
installed on RH7.3

I am new to all this. Can someone please guide me on this?

Thanks you very much.
Regards,
Reshmi
