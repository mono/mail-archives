<PRE>Hello to everybody

I'm using Glade 0.6.4 and I would like to run programs that refer to pixmaps 
in places that fit to pixmaps... as everybody seems to do

so for instance I'd like to have the program in

	/usr/local/myprogram/bin/

and the pixmaps in 

	/usr/share/pixmaps/myprogram/

But paths of pixmaps are relative. 
If I tell glade that the pixmaps directory is 

	/usr/share/pixmaps/myprogram/
 
and I am at 

	/usr/local/myprogram/bin/

I can launch the program and find the pixmaps, because the program will look 
at ../../../../usr/share/pixmaps/myprogram/. 

But if I am elsewhere and I launch /usr/local/myprogram/bin/mycompiledprogram 
, the only result is a complain about not finding 
../../../../usr/share/pixmaps/myprogram/

How do I fix that? I think that I need to fix that at Glade level, I mean, 
what do you do to fix that?

Any help will be appreciated

TIA
Ernesto
