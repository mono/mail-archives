<PRE>I'm fairly new to glade and I have been having compile problems with my 
GUI project for several days now.  I was able to work through the 
autogen and autoconfig problems I was having, but now I have errors when 
trying to make the program.  I would think that if the configure runs 
fine, then the make should compile fine also.  It seems like I don't 
have the libraries I need, but I know that they are there.  Any help 
would be appreciated.  Thanks.

The error:
