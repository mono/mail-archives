<PRE>Gabriel,

Your suggestion is interesting. I would like to further enhance
your usability suggestion so as to incorporate all features we
discussed pertaining to this topic.

Each row in the main window could be of the form:

[checkbox] [window icon] [label]

Clicking on the checkbox toggles visibility.
Clicking on the window icon raises, and checks the checkbox if not
already checked.
Clicking on the label allows the label to change to a box where you
can type the name
  of the window into for convenience, and then enter changes it back to a label.

A menu item to hide hide all windows would also be available.

Anything else? Further comments welcome.

Thank you all for your feedback,

Neil Zanella

</PRE>
