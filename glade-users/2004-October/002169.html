It says that, but I can't see the code which reuses the loaded data
(i.e. the GladeInterface). It just looks like wasted memory at the
moment.

So for people using libglade I'd suggest:

 1) Use a separate XML file for each window/dialog. Otherwise when you
    call glade_xml_new() on a file it parses the whole file. Also if
    you don't pass a root element to create it creates one of each
    window/dialog, which is also wasteful.

 2) Don't keep GladeXML objects around. Load the Glade XML file, get
    pointers to the widgets you need, then unref the GladeXML object.
