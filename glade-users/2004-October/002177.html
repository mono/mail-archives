<PRE>Hello,

Anyone know of a neatifying nice simple algorithm that will name 4000
widgets based on
parsing an XML tree and using user feedback to get prefixes at various
stages from the
user and build a nice tree of widgets with names that make sense to
the programmer
and not just to the GUI builder.

If you know of any, or sites pointing out conventions for naming such
widgets, or
would like to discuss such an algorithm with me, then please
contribute your thoughts.

I don't think anyone should spend a whole day or more just renaming
widgets so that
they have sutable name. A compromise is needed: an XML tree parser such that
names in such a way that respects tree structure and incorporates some user
defined names.

Feedback welcome!

Neil
