<PRE>Hello,

The paths to your libs are screwed up somehow.  This is nothing really  
to do with glade itself, but your installation.  Run ./configure again,  
or whatever, and make sure ldconfig has done its magic.  Also make sure  
you are compiling against the correct libs.  Glade 2 natively does NOT  
compile against glade1 (gtk1.*) stuff.  Your GtkClist is gtk1.* stuff.   
It's been deprecated since Gtk2.0 came out, several YEARS ago.

This problem has come up time and again, ever since we all switched to  
Gtk2.0 and above, with people using the old gtk libs.  Check the list  
archives for more detailed answers.

Rikke
