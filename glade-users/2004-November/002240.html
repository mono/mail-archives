<PRE>Hello,

There is one advantage of code generation which I really miss. It has
nothing to do
with code generation itself though. It has to do with the fact that I
have so many
widgets, and I keep forgetting exactly what I have named them, so while I write
the backend for my glade code I keep having to reopen the glade file and have
to constantly go back and click just to find that name.

What I plan to do is write a _fast_ command line utility which allows
you to traverse
glade widgets (it will have a tree like interface) and go and find,
and possibly even
change, the names of widgets. This is useful for reference while coding once the
interface has been laid out as I just explained.

Any objections? Comments?

Thanks,

Neil
