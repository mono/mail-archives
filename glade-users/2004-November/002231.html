hi, thanks for replying
 
  I was referring to both actually.
 
  For instance, when I start my glade program, a real-time counter begins in the background, so that it'll be displayed in my glade program, counting in 1 second interval.
  Then when I want to execute something in hard real-time, a signal is sent to the real-time to execute immediately.
  I've tried experimenting with rtlinux-3.2-pre2, but I can only do it in linux platform, and I'm trying to code it in main.c in my glade program... 
 
  do you know how I can for instance,
 
  insert an entry box in my glade window,
  then see a real-time counter, see a number in that box that increases from 0 onwards in 1 second interval, after executing the glade program?
  
  i've heard of clock.h, but I don't have any clues to go about doing it.
 
  thanks again.
 
regards,
aaron

Do you mean &quot;real time&quot; as in &quot;the program is running at the same time as your
Glade program, and they interact back and forth&quot;, or do you mean the usual
computer-science meaning of the phrase &quot;real time&quot; as in &quot;this program has
specific critical timing constraints&quot; (such as if it doesn't respond to an
interrupt in 50 milliseconds, the chemical plant blows up)

Doing *real* &quot;real-time&quot; programming in the Linux kernel isn't as easy as it
looks, as there's lots of latency-inducing locks inside the kernel and the
like. Ingo Molnar has been doing some work in this area, but there's still
quite a ways to go before it's a hardened real-time operating system.
