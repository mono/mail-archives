No, that isn't the correct thing to do. As soon as autoconf or automake
is run again it will overwrite your changes.

You probably need to add a -L option to tell it which directory the
libraries are in.
 


&gt;<i> one more question refer to your answer to my second program. 
</I>&gt;<i> &amp;gt;That looks OK. It looks like the project is already built so doesn't

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> if it's ok,  why i can't find the .executable file?
</I>
It should be in the src directory. Try 'make clean' and 'make' again.

&gt;<i>  what i am really 
</I>&gt;<i> suprised is that reality that when i made changes on one glade project, all 
</I>&gt;<i> the other projects (which were working properly) can not 'make'.
</I>
Changes to one project shouldn't affect other projects. You've probably
accidentally changed them somehow.
