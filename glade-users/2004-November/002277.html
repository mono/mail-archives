Greetings:
 
I'm just getting started with Glade and was looking for very simple progs. The examples programs are fairly involved and require a lot of study. I was thinking about a program with just a top level window and one button that when clicked brought up a filesel widget. And the buttons would be hooked up. Studying the examples from GTK+ takes you so far but Glade is another thing and there are difference that are complicated (Glade hookup and all that).
A number of very trivial programs would be very useful to get a guy up and running. Using Glade itself is really easy but hooking everything up and getting your program running is another thing.
 
Thanks,
 
Bob
