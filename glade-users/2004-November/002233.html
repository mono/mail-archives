<PRE>HI, all,
I wonder if anyone could encounter this problem before.
I am using glade.2.0 on redhatlinux 9.0. previously the glade workds very 
well.
seems after i have modified some of its linking files, i get the error 
below.

below is my running result:

[<A HREF="mailto:root@localhost">root@localhost</A> wheelchair]# make
make  all-recursive
make[1]: Entering directory `/root/Projects/wheelchair'
Making all in src
make[2]: Entering directory `/root/Projects/wheelchair/src'
make[2]: Nothing to be done for `all'.
make[2]: Leaving directory `/root/Projects/wheelchair/src'
Making all in po
make[2]: Entering directory `/root/Projects/wheelchair/po'
make[2]: Nothing to be done for `all'.
make[2]: Leaving directory `/root/Projects/wheelchair/po'
make[2]: Entering directory `/root/Projects/wheelchair'
make[2]: Leaving directory `/root/Projects/wheelchair'
make[1]: Leaving directory `/root/Projects/wheelchair'

unfornately, my other glade files are also affected, plz see below the 
reult for another file ,  previously it can make.

so really urgently need your help, 'cause i can't do anything with glade on 
this computer anymore.

thanks in advance.
