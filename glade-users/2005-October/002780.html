Why don't you just add the code after the call to create_windowX()?
I don't see the need for a callback to do initialization.

I just tried adding a &quot;realize&quot; handler and it worked fine. &quot;map&quot; works
as well. Are you sure you added the signal? (The Glade interface is a
bit confusing for that. Look in the XML file to check.)
