</I>

I needed the callback so that it would be a member function of the class
that the window created. I suppose I could also have it call that function
from outside the class as easily.

Where is create_windowX()? I should have specified that I am using C++ with
glademm/gtkmm, etc for code generation.

In another case, I want to load default values into a configuration dialog
box every time show() is called. I'd like to have that be done from a
callback in the dialog, but again, I suppose it is possible to call it from
the same place where winConfig-&gt;show() is being called.

I just don't see why these handlers don't work when they seem like they
should be. It's not that I couldn't find a way to work around them, it would
just be a lot more elegant if I could use them when I need to.

I just tried adding a &quot;realize&quot; handler and it worked fine. &quot;map&quot; works
&gt;<i> as well. Are you sure you added the signal? (The Glade interface is a
</I>&gt;<i> bit confusing for that. Look in the XML file to check.)
</I>

Fairly certain I added the handler. I have a lot of other handlers (button
presses, etc) and they work fine, all
added in the same way. Glade did add code to my files, including a stub
on_realize() function. I added a bit of a hello world in there, and it
doesn't ever get called.
