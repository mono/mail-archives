<PRE>Hello Folks,

I have recently started experimenting with glade and gtk2. I have found that 
when I open a previously saved project, the widget hierarchy is populated 
correctly, but the workspace area that should contain a view of my GUI is 
empty (glade-3) or missing (glade-2). This happens in all three combinations 
of environments I have tried: Using glade-2 on SuSE 9.3, glade-3 on SuSE 9.3, 
and glade-3 on OpenSuSE10.2.

I have found I can make my GUI appear on glade-3 by cutting the top level 
window from the widget hierarchy area using the scissors tool, then undoing 
the cut. Without an undo function on glade-2, &#160;I have been unable to display 
it at all.

The project I have been trying to open was originally created by glade, and 
compiles without error, and runs successfully.

Has anyone else experienced this, and if so, have they identified a fix or a 
better work-around than cut and undo?

Also, on starting glade-3 on OpenSuSE10.2 from the command line, I get the 
following message:

GladeUI-WARNING **: No icon named 'widget-gtk-menushell' was found for widget 
class 'GtkMenuShell'

It doesn't appear to be causing me any problems as yet, but again, can anyone 
shed light on this or suggest a fix?

Thank you in anticipation.


Best regards,

Stuart
