<PRE>Hi Dave, 

I'm a rookie my self, but I'll tell you what I've figured out, I'm using 
GLADE 0.5.11

The only file I'm edited in my programs is the callbacks.c.  I had to modify 
the main window once because it opened all the dialog boxes at the wrong 
start of the program, but that's the only time.  (though I haven't compleated 
a progject yet.


I haven't messed with the GtkCombo box yet, but here is what my book says the 
code should be...

gchar * selectedvalue;
selectedvalue = gtk_entry_get_text(GTK_ENTRY(GTK_COMBO(combo) -&gt; entry));

I think you were missing the  ' -&gt;entry' part.


If this doesn't help you, I try getting it to work on my end and help you 
out.  I'm been able to get all the other widgets to work for me for the most 
part.

My book that I'm using, which is really good for my level is titled

Beginning GTK+/Gnome Programming, by Peter Wright

it has a glade tutor which shows you how to make a simple calculater.  There 
is a bunch of sample code, which you can get online, www.wrox.com.

Another useful resorce is the the GTK+ resference web page,
<A HREF="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/gtk/index.html">http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/gtk/index.html</A>


Hope that helps,
-jeff
