<PRE>My program is crashing and giving me this error message


Gtk-CRITICAL **: file gtkobject.c: line 1179 (gtk_object_unref): assertion 
`object-&gt;ref_count &gt; 0' failed.

The background.

I'm working on this program which has 2 clist in the main window (clist_1 and 
clist_2), with a button over each.  When the button is clicked, it pops up a 
dialog box with another 2 clist(clist_1a and clist_2b).  One clist is a list 
of things the user can pick (clist_1a).  The one on the right is a list of 
thing the uses has picked (clist_2a).  When the user is done, he hits 'okay' 
and the picked items move to the clist on the main window(clist_1).  

Same story with (clist_2) but with different options.

The problem I'm having right now is that in clist_2, if I open the dialog, 
hit okay, open again and hit okay, the clist_2 is gone.  The scroll bars on 
the sides are there, but the clist is gone.  I used the same basic code to 
build both boxes, just with different names and information, but this doesn't 
happen with clist_1 at all.  I've tried every combination I could think of, 
but it will not crash.  Open the clist_2 dialog 2 times and it deletes the 
clsit_2.  Anyone have any idea what is happening?

Thats,

-Jeff
