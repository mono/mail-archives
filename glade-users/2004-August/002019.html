<PRE>Hello, I have a small &quot;bug&quot; report (which is probably more about the
way I'm using Glade, but anyway...)

DESCRIPTION:
I'm experiencing a problem trying to edit someone else's .glade file
(it's for <A HREF="http://liferea.sf.net/">http://liferea.sf.net/</A>).

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
1. open liferea's .glade file in Glade 2.5.0
2. double-click &quot;mainwindow&quot; to edit liferea's main application window
3. select the GtkMenuBar, named &quot;menubar&quot;
4. click &quot;Edit Menus...&quot; in the Property Editor
5. select the GtkMenuItem with the label &quot;About&quot; 
6. click on the Stock Item dropdown

EXPECTED RESULT:
Could select &quot;About&quot; with a yellow star.

ACTUAL RESULT:
Many stock items, including &quot;_About&quot;, are missing from the Stock Item dropdown.

FREQUENCY:
Always.


Any ideas on what I might try to be able to make the About child item
in the Help menu item into a Stock Item from within Glade? I'm
proceeding manually (writing the C by hand) right now, but I would
really like to understand what's going on in Glade.

Here's one of the Google searches I tried when looking for information
on the subject:
site:lists.ximian.com inurl:glade &quot;menu editor&quot; stock
Would anyone suggest a better search technique?


Side note: how might I convince the liferea authors to use libglade?
They would rather generate C code to avoid adding pre-install
dependencies to their project. I'm actually hoping Nathan or Lars is
on this mailing list. :)

Thank you,
-Adam
