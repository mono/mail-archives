point this is all new to me.  I am trying to just get started with Gtk
because my department has decided on Gtk.  Most of them are working on
Sun/Solaris and Ada so I am on my own for Windows and C/C++.

searching I found MinGW developer studio at <A HREF="http://www.parinya.ca/">http://www.parinya.ca/</A> and
I assume this is the one to which you refer?  Has anyone ever done this

Do you know what those reasons are?  I tried visiting
<A HREF="http://glade.gnome.org/history.html">http://glade.gnome.org/history.html</A>  but I didn't see anything about it
there.  I also looked at <A HREF="http://glade.gnome.org/links.html">http://glade.gnome.org/links.html</A> and clicked on
libglade but it is a dead link.  That doesn't seem too encouraging

&gt;<i> think the libglade sample and test files along with the API reference that

</I>I am looking but I still haven't found those examples.  After getting past
configuration issues, making a simple project with Glade built code was
a piece of cake but without any example or simple tutorial, doing so with
libglade isn't so easy.
