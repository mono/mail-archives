</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, after some time without changing the application, I opened it using

</I>&gt;<i> allow me to rename a widget and use the same name I already used for
</I>&gt;<i> another one, even if they lie inside completely different containers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to ask if this behaviour is &quot;by design&quot;, or is there a way to

I don't have an answer to your question, but I thought that it might help
for you to know that I also use 3.4.5 and I also practice the technique
that you described of using the name in multiple glade files, but I have
not observed the problem that you described.  Oh, wait.  I think the
difference is that I put one thing -- what you are calling a container, I
think -- inside each Glade file.  Perhaps you could solve your problem by
splitting your glade files.
