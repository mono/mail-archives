<PRE>Glade 3.10 is finally here, and by the looks of it, late.

Glade 3.10 is the first stable series of Glade that depends on GTK+3
and it is parallel installable with previous versions of Glade which
depend on GTK+2.

Some major changes:
  - There is no libgnomeui plugin anymore
  - No deprecated widget classes are included
  - The Python plugin now uses PyObject (which uses GTK+3)
    instead of the old pygtk bindings (this means that to use
    your python widgets in the Glade runtime they need to be
    ported to use PyObject)
  - This version of Glade is sealed and we will do our best
    to maintain API/ABI compatibility in following releases
  - Glade comes with the preview feature which is also a stand-alone
    'glade-previewer' program (for packagers, this should be included
    in the same package as the libgladeui-2 library).

Special thanks goes to:

  - Juan Pablo the Magnificent our hero who is responsible for 
    the sexy new workspace look and feel (and also there to help
    me fix and wrap up the builds in the last minute).
  - Marco Diego Aur&#233;lio Mesquita for his work on the new preview feature
  - Florent Th&#233;venet for creating icons for every widget class
  - Openismus GmbH for sponsoring my work on Glade.

Some additional information about this release can be found in
my blog <A HREF="http://blogs.gnome.org/tvb/2011/01/15/the-glade-dl/">http://blogs.gnome.org/tvb/2011/01/15/the-glade-dl/</A>

What is Glade?
============
Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick &amp; easy development of user
interfaces for the GTK+ toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment. 
The user interfaces designed in Glade are saved as XML, and by using 
the GtkBuilder GTK+ object these can be loaded by applications
dynamically as needed.

By using GtkBuilder, Glade XML files can be used in numerous
programming languages including C, C++, C#, Vala, Java, Perl, 
Python, and others.
