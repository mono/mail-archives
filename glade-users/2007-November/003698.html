<PRE>Gladex 0.4.1 is released!

What is Gladex?
Gladex is a Python application which takes a .glade file written in the
Glade User Interface Builder and generates code in Perl, Python, or
Ruby. The generated code uses libglade to draw a GUI and is not raw
code. Support for additional languages can be added through the plugin
API.

Why Gladex?
Gladex is a response to several inadequacies found in other scripts that
template code. Many scripts were unmaintained, confusing to use, or did
not do what we needed them to do. Gladex is unique among these programs
in that it has a plugin architecture allowing many languages to be
supported through one interface.

What is the future of Gladex?
Our goal is to consolide the functionality of and eventually depreciate
similar applications such as glc (Python), tepache (Python), PyGCG
(Python), eglade (Eiffel), Glade# (C#), and ruby-glade-create-template
(Ruby)

How can I help?
Any feedback in this thread would be greatly appreciated as that will
help us shape the future of Gladex. Specific comments would be great
since that might help us decide what should change and what should
remain as the application develops. Also, questions would be very
helpful because answering them here will help us write documentation
that addresses common questions.

We need help in four main areas:
      * Testing - Testers are always needed, so we can squash those
        bugs.
      * Development - We would love for others to write plugins for
        languages they are familiar with. Let us know if you are
        interested in development.
      * Packaging - Our main need is for an expert packager to give us a
        hand making a proper source package for use with Launchpad's PPA
        system.
      * Documentation - The manual is pretty good, but we could an
        update to the wiki and the tutorial pages.
