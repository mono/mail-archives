There's no templates. You can move your code which creates dynamic UI
into a custom widget. This widget then would read xml description of
your structures and create internal child widgets for each field based
on that. Then you can add this widget to glade through use of a catalog.

Even better, if you have full control over your xml structure
description, then you can make it to be actually GtkBuilder xml. Say you
define object &quot;record&quot; which would hold list of &quot;field&quot; objects with all
required properties, and your custom widget then would create internal
child widgets to reflect your &quot;record&quot; object structure instead of
having to parse xml. This way you can edit and save whole record
definitions directly with glade if you'd wish to do so. Really neat
feature by the way.

In any case you still have to write the code which creates these
internal widgets, so it is up to you to decide if your time worth to be
spent on moving this code to a custom widget. If you have any experience
writing custom widgets, then it shouldn't take too much time, otherwise
go for it only if you want to gain such experience and don't have any
deadlines set.
