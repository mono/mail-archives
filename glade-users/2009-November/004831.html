<PRE>Hi Tristan,

I got so excited with your answer that I immediately put people to work
and started a development plan. :-)  <A HREF="https://launchpad.net/cdd">https://launchpad.net/cdd</A> as part
of our umbrella project <A HREF="https://launchpad.net/mlhim">https://launchpad.net/mlhim</A> Hence I forgot to
send a BIG thank you for your reply.

If anyone is interested in learning about leading edge healthcare
information systems and would like to join in the project, the current
primary mailing list is actually the OSHIP developers list
<A HREF="https://launchpad.net/~oship-dev">https://launchpad.net/~oship-dev</A> since it is the oldest project.
However, we will be centralizing on the MLHIM umbrella soon.

Cheers,
Tim

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi All,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For those that may have built their own widgets and added them to Glade
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd like to ask a question.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I want to use the Glade machinery to allow users to build what I call
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; constraint definitions against a well defined reference model.  There
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will only be about 30 or so widgets and most of them are simply
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; adaptations of existing widgets.  Containers, trees, lists, text boxes,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; etc. but of course all the properties/constraints are different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (actually simpler than in Glade).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So I would like to hide/remove the existing Glade widgets and leave only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; my two libraries visible.  Then in the XML I will write the names of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; classes from the reference model as well as modify all the property
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; settings according to each class as needed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So why do this?  Well, it gives me a great starting point for people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without knowledge of a complex system to be able to put components
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; together in a way that makes sense to them in their domain.  Gives me a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; generic XML output that I can use to build classes for a variety of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; programming languages that can be executed against this reference model
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in each of those languages.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here is a (non-sensical) modified XML file just showing how I envision
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the object (class) names being changed to match the reference model.  I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; didn't bother with the property names but you can imaging that they will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be modified extensively as well.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would appreciate any thoughts/commets/feedback on this approach.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>     First of all, everything you want to do should be quite simple and require
</I>&gt;<i> no modifications to Glade, except hiding the existing catalogs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Glade installs usually with at least the GTK+ catalog - and while practically
</I>&gt;<i> speaking, you dont need to display this catalog in the palette, you do need
</I>&gt;<i> the GTK+ catalog to be installed to do useful things with GTK+ derived objects.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, if you havent yet looked into the reference docs, the idea is that
</I>&gt;<i> every catalog provides an adaptor class for any object that the catalog wants
</I>&gt;<i> to introduce to the Glade runtime - so for instance, to leverage the code
</I>&gt;<i> that does Drag/Resize in the GtkTable widget, you will want to derive from
</I>&gt;<i> the GladeWidgetAdaptor that was subclassed for GtkTable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I would suggest you start by creating your catalog with your GTK+ derived
</I>&gt;<i> widgets and depend on the 'gtk+' catalog - when you are finished that part,
</I>&gt;<i> which may only imply declaring the object types and disableing/hiding some
</I>&gt;<i> properties, or could imply providing some of your own custom editing widgets
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e. the property editor is subclassable and allows you to present
</I>&gt;<i> the information
</I>&gt;<i> differently than just flat properties, the class adaptor provides a mechanism
</I>&gt;<i> to create an editor on behalf of the class)...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway that would be the juice of your work, hiding the installed GTK+ catalog
</I>&gt;<i> from the palette could be a feature you maintain as a downstream hack/patch
</I>&gt;<i> against Glade, or if its of any real use to others we could even develop some
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism in Glade to hide widgets from catalog dependencies.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, you could even probably just remove the
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;glade-widget-class-ref&gt; entries
</I>&gt;<i> and &lt;glade-widget-group&gt; entries in the GTK+ catalog, which would result in the
</I>&gt;<i> types getting properly introduced into the runtime, but no references
</I>&gt;<i> to the widgets
</I>&gt;<i> from the palette.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Have fun :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>         -Tristan
