I think I see how it might be possible.  You would define a widget-group
along the same lines as a radio button group.  Then you could call
gtk_group_apply(group, function, userdata); to apply the function to
every widget in the group.  Then, if we could make function's legitimate
targets of the signal pane's &quot;object&quot; or &quot;data&quot; field, you could call
gtk_group_apply as the callback to a function or something.  Granted
this would require a rethink of how we define signal callbacks, but it
is possible in the longer term.  Matthew, sorry but for now it isn't
possible, it's a fair amount of work to add, and there are more
important things to do first.  So if you really want this, you'll
probably have to do it yourself :(.
