</I>&gt;<i> The point here is that I believe it is easier to define within Glade the

</I>&gt;<i> than to try and maintain kludgy lists of widgets which you need to make

I don't think it would be easy to define the conditions for
de-sensitizing
widgets. I think this probably has to be done by the application.
