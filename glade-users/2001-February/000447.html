Basically the point is to define groups of things that you can disable
at once, especially menu items and stuff.  As far as I know GTK+ doesn't
support this, my thought was that Glade could support groups, and it
could automatically generate functions to toggle groups en masse.

</I>
Sorry, I meant add a column within Glade.

&gt;&gt;<i> 5.  What's the best way to handle dynamic menus, both in the situation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where the whole menu is dynamic, and only part of the menu is dynamic?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In particular I can't find any way to create an empty submenu.

</I>
Well, basically the idea was some menu items for common prefs.  For
example you could select a current proxy from a submenu, and obviously
the proxies wouldn't be static because they're user-defined.  MRU lists
are another obvious application.  I can't think of any other reasons to
consider them.

&gt;&gt;<i> Furthermore, I'd like to suggest that you can bring up the menu editor
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by double clicking a menu bar in the &quot;window&quot; window.
</I>&gt;<i> At the moment &quot;Edit Menu&quot; is an option in the right-click popup menu.
</I>
I didn't notice this, thanks.

     My experience is that in general, if there's jobs programming
                 in it, it's not worth programming in.
