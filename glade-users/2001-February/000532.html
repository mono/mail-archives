<PRE>Andrae,

Thanks for the info. I was wondering whether this might have
something to do with gmodule because I read something about
that in the Libglade Reference Manual.

However, the little sample program that I'm using is really
just C code compiled with a C++ compiler because I was trying
to demonstrate that I could use Libglade with C++. If I compile
it with a C compiler I still have the same problem. So I'm
left where I started.

BTW, do you know where I could look to get some info on
how to add C++ name-mangling support to gmodule? This 
doesn't sound very trivial.

Regards,
Dean

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've been trying to use Libglade to automatically connect signal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; handlers in my C++ code, but the glade_xml_signal_autoconnect
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; function is not working.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So I decided to try to connect the signal handlers manually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using glade_xml_signal_connect (instead of autoconnect) as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; shown:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; glade_xml_signal_connect(xml, &quot;on_about1_activate&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC(on_about1_activate));
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This doesn't work either. I get no error message, but the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; signal handler isn't connected. Selecting the Help-&gt;About
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; menu option does nothing, when it should be calling my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; signal handler to display a Help About window.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does anyone have any ideas on what could be wrong with my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; environment or what libraries might not be built with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; correct support, or whatever. I have no idea where to look.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Ahhh I was going to reply to this the other day, but I ran out of time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would guess that you are being caught out by C++'s name mangling.
</I>&gt;<i> libglade's introspection is based on gmodule, which is based on libdl.
</I>&gt;<i> This allows you to search the current processes symbol table for a given
</I>&gt;<i> symbol and extract the associated pointer reference.  All very funky and
</I>&gt;<i> cool, and I'm using the same facilities in developing the plugin
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure for Glade.  However there is a problem, in that the
</I>&gt;<i> mapping between a C function and it's symbol is very simple (prepend a
</I>&gt;<i> _), whereas the name mangling for C++ is a awful mess.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So effectively what this means is, you either have to add C++
</I>&gt;<i> name-mangling support to gmodule (and possibly libdl), or you can only
</I>&gt;<i> dynamically connect to functions using C linkage.  It's been a while
</I>&gt;<i> since I did any C++ at all, however I believe you do this by enclosing
</I>&gt;<i> the signature (and function?) with extern &quot;C&quot; { ... } blocks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I remember you still had a problem with the C code I sent you so
</I>&gt;<i> there maybe an additional problem unrelated to this.
