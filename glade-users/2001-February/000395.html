Anything along the lines of &quot;You can only use this if you're a nice
person&quot; is incompatiable with the Open Source Definition (which is alot
less strict then the GPL).

You can't reword this to make it compatible.

It is what you're trying to do that makes it non-Free, not how you're
doing it. No matter how you reword this, it cannot remain Free Software.

Regardless, this is off-topic for this list, so I won't be posting in
this thread again.

Free Software was designed to stop you doing something like this, and
alot of people happen to consider that a good thing.
