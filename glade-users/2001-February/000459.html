Oh dear. I thought we'd fixed these sort of problems.
It looks like the wrong visual/colormap is being used somewhere.

This is difficult for me to track down, since it doesn't happen on
Linux boxes. (I assume this is your Solaris box.)

I think the problem occurs because Linux boxes use the same visual
(i.e. color depth) for all the screen, whereas some systems like
Solaris often use different visuals in different windows. But if
you accidentally try to draw in the wrong type of visual you get
a 'BadMatch'.

You could try adding this to glade/main.c, just before the call to
glade_init():

   gtk_widget_push_visual (gdk_imlib_get_visual ());


That would hopefully make all the Glade windows try to use the same
visual. (The one that imlib wants to use for drawing graphics.)
I'm guessing a bit, though.


 
&gt;<i> One other thing - when I start Glade now, I get a message
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;GnomeUI-WARNING **: Could not open help topics file NULL&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Is this just because Glade and gnome-libs were built without
</I>&gt;<i> doc-books installed so the documentation wasn't generated?
</I>
Yes, I think so. You won't see the online help menu items, but it
shouldn't cause any problems.
