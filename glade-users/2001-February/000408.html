</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GnomeUIItems because libglade seems to create menus a bit funny. Anyway,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how would I handle this? How do I define a menu structure without using

</I>&gt;<i> Ah, menus are tricky like that.  They're sort of pseudo-compound

</I>&gt;<i> funny&quot;?  I haven't had any problems with menus myself.
</I>
Yes, tricky indeed :-) What I mean by funny is that I tried to get the
GtkMenuItemFactory that was used to build the menu, but I couldn't find
one. It looks like glade builds all menus with gtk_menu_new and thing,
instead of using GnomeUIItems. Maybe I'm just stupid. Anyway, I managed
to get it to do what I want by making a part of the interface manually,
and that is enough for me. 

&gt;<i> As far as normal custom widgets are concerned, take a look at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://users.bigpond.net.au/mlm/libglade/">http://users.bigpond.net.au/mlm/libglade/</A> which is a tutorial a friend
</I>&gt;<i> of mine gave on using libglade.  It includes a decent discussion on how
</I>&gt;<i> to add support for custom widgets to libglade, including a real-life
</I>&gt;<i> example from an application he's written that needs to do exactly that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On a related note, while working on this, I really wished there was a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; program that will display a tree of widgets of a running gtk program,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you seem to know a lot about gtk/glade, so that's maybe something for a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; next project :-)
</I>&gt;<i> For the moment, all my OSS work is focused on glade/libglade.  This
</I>&gt;<i> would be a seperate application along the lines of editres.  Have you
</I>&gt;<i> had a look at GGAD?  IIRC it contains enough information on
</I>&gt;<i> GtkObject/GtkWidget to permit someone to write a tool like this.
</I>
No I haven't read it, but I think if I spend enough time I could write
it, but I just don't have the time so I was hoping that someone else
would write it :-)
So anyone on the list reading this, if you're bored this weekend, have a
look at it :-)

&gt;<i> P.S.  This discussion is probably best moved to the list, as I suspect
</I>&gt;<i> other people are likely to be interested in the above as well.
</I>
Ok.

cheers,
