No. It has been discussed several times before, though, and may be added
one day.

 
&gt;<i> 2.  Is there some way I can declare a &quot;disable condition&quot;, and disable

</I>&gt;<i> automatically generated a function that I can call into.
</I>
I don't understand this. What gets disabled?

 
&gt;<i> 3.  Is there any way to insert columns into a CList widget once created?
</I>
You do that in your own code somewhere. Maybe after the call to create the
window (create_window1() etc.)

 
&gt;<i> 4.  When is there likely to be an undo/redo facility?
</I>
Someone volunteered to do this, but I haven't seen any code.

 
&gt;<i> 5.  What's the best way to handle dynamic menus, both in the situation
</I>&gt;<i> where the whole menu is dynamic, and only part of the menu is dynamic?
</I>&gt;<i> In particular I can't find any way to create an empty submenu.
</I>
Create the stable part in Glade, then manipulate the widgets in your
code to add/remove menus. I don't think that would be too difficult.


&gt;<i> Furthermore, I'd like to suggest that you can bring up the menu editor
</I>&gt;<i> by double clicking a menu bar in the &quot;window&quot; window.
</I>
Yes, that may be useful.
