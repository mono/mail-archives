</I>
The GTK+ documentation for the widget classes.  Each instance of a
widget on screen has a set of properties that they have as a result of
being within their class, including the properties of the inherited
classes.

&gt;<i> A lot of them are self-explanitory, but I don't know
</I>&gt;<i> what &quot;WM Name&quot; and &quot;WM Class&quot; are for on a window widget.
</I>
Window manager name and class name.  They are used for selecting
resources from the resource database kept on the X server (usually
loaded from .Xdefaults) and for the window manager to help group
windows.  The convention is to use lowercase for the WM Name and mixed
case for WM Class, and to either use the application name as started by
the user (e.g. argv[0]) or to adopt a name based on the application name
and the file loaded (if any).

So, for a program called &quot;example&quot;, the WM Name would be &quot;example&quot; and
the WM Class would be &quot;Example&quot; .

&gt;<i> 2. If I want to populate a list box when a window opens, what is the
</I>&gt;<i> proper signal I should trigger off to do this?
</I>
Many possibilities.  I use a map signal.  Others populate the list after
the create_window() call after using the returned widget pointer to find
(using lookup_widget()) the pointer to the list box.

&gt;<i> Is there documentation for this as well?
</I>
The GTK+ documentation and tutorial.  Glade sits on top of GTK+, and has
no reason to duplicate the documentation effort.  It is also very common
to read other sources to find out how other people did them.  The use of
tools in isolation using documentation with the tool and without
real-world examples has gone out the window now.

&gt;<i> 3. How do I attach a gtk popup menu widget to my window?
</I>
Pass.  I've not done that yet.

&gt;<i> 4. After I add a Clist to my window, is there a way to edit the number
</I>&gt;<i> of columns it has?
</I>
I think this was discussed recently?  I've just checked gtkclist.h for
GTK+ 1.2.  No, you need to delete and recreate it.  If your application
needs to dynamically add or subtract columns, consider other tabular
data widget classes.
