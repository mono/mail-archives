<PRE>I am currently working on an application that uses the Gnome
Application Window.  The window contains a h-pane which will contain
a GTKTree on the left pain and dynamically allocated forms in the
right pane.  The desire is to create the appropriate contents of the
right pane dynamically based on the selection the user made on either
the toolbar or menu.  I will be using a common container widget for
all forms to be placed in the right pane.  The goal is to product
something like a file manager.

Ok, here's my question.  Is there a way in glade to create forms
so that they can be dynamically allocated to a specific container. 
In other words, it appears to me that all forms created in glade must
contain a &quot;window&quot;.  The forms I need would not contain windows, only 
a base container widget (eg GtkBox).  Can I create a form in
Glade starting with the base container widget?  I realize the
code to display each form in the application window must be
created outside of Glade but creating the forms would save time.
