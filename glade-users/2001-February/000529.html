I would guess that you are being caught out by C++'s name mangling. 
libglade's introspection is based on gmodule, which is based on libdl. 
This allows you to search the current processes symbol table for a given
symbol and extract the associated pointer reference.  All very funky and
cool, and I'm using the same facilities in developing the plugin
infrastructure for Glade.  However there is a problem, in that the
mapping between a C function and it's symbol is very simple (prepend a
_), whereas the name mangling for C++ is a awful mess.

So effectively what this means is, you either have to add C++
name-mangling support to gmodule (and possibly libdl), or you can only
dynamically connect to functions using C linkage.  It's been a while
since I did any C++ at all, however I believe you do this by enclosing
the signature (and function?) with extern &quot;C&quot; { ... } blocks.

Anyway, I remember you still had a problem with the C code I sent you so
there maybe an additional problem unrelated to this.
