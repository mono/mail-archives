<PRE>&gt;<i> Be aware that any code including any manifesto of this type is not Free
</I>&gt;<i> Software.  It dosn't meet the Open Source Definition guidelines and
</I>&gt;<i> would classified as non-free by the Debian project.
</I>
And how about this:

/******************  Software Mestizo Manifesto  *********************
 * The Software Mestizo Manifesto in no way is a License addenda:
 * 
 * We the authors agree this code is according to the Software Mestizo 
 * Manifesto meaning it has been developed with the help of many diverse 
 * individuals worldwide; no matter their racial or cultural origin, they 
 * all work together in peace and harmony in the belief of humankind 
 * fraternity.  Using this software with the purpose of harming these 
 * principles is to harm the software itself.
 *
 * We advice to use it only in the context of these principles or refrain 
 * from its use if you don't agree with the spirit in which it was
 * written.
 */
 
&gt;<i> It would also be incompatible with the GPL.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also as it is supposed to be a license, it is sufficiently vague legally
</I>&gt;<i> to cause signifigant legal risks to anyone using the software,
</I>&gt;<i> regardless of any beliefs.  Probably to the point of being void and
</I>&gt;<i> therefore rendering any product licensed under it unlicensed and
</I>&gt;<i> therefore illegal to use by anyone who didn't author 100% of the code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please try to stick to licenses that have been vetted by at least one
</I>&gt;<i> lawyer, preferably GPL, LGPL, MIT(BSD - ads), or Artistic to avoid
</I>&gt;<i> contributing to the plague of new licenses around today.
</I>
The Manifesto is not a License. Is a Manifesto. Just stop using this
software to commit a genocide.. for example.. is that so bad?

OK... sorry very much for the off-topic.. this is my last message, I 
promise... if somebody agrees and want to improve this to make it
compatible with debian/GNU/GPL and all flavours of Open Source thats ok..  
please write to me not to the list.


Regards

Roberto
