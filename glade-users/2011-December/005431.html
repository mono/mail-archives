<PRE>Hello again, thanks for the reply. To answer:

&gt;<i> Are you by chance editing a glade file with a rediculously large
</I>&gt;<i> GtkTable/GtkGrid ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I've tried this with only a window and a vertical box, some buttons and
some entries, nothing complex.
It is slow no matter what's in there.


&gt;<i> Please define what you mean by &quot;anything I click&quot;, I can't believe that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can you please try Glade on a new project and measure/try the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - Time to create the first GtkWindow
</I>&gt;<i>  - Time to create the first GtkWindow's child GtkBox or GtkGrid
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These 2 steps should be 'slightly' slower than
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - Time to select the toplevel GtkWindow (and update properties in the
</I>&gt;<i> editor)
</I>&gt;<i>  - Time to select the GtkWindow child
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
As I can tell, both of the above are just as slow. I've &quot;analysed&quot; this a
bit and
editing properties is instant (changing labels, positions in a box, ...).
However, what is slow is selecting a widget of a different type than what
was selected before.


&gt;<i> The first time selecting/creating a widget of any object class is slower
</I>&gt;<i> because after creating an editor for a given class we cache the editors
</I>&gt;<i> in order to display them quicker.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Maybe on my machine/system it doesn't cache for some reason?


&gt;<i> Then, try:
</I>&gt;<i>  - Loading a separate project
</I>&gt;<i>  - Switch tabs from project to project
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Switching tabs takes a long time too, pretty much the same interval
as selecting widgets of different types.

Then try for instance:
&gt;<i>  - Clicking the &quot;File&quot; menu
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is quick. So I assume it isn't a GTK/theme problem.


&gt;<i> For what it's worth, the bottlenecks in Glade are really:
</I>&gt;<i>  - Time to load a project (at least now we have progress bar feedback)
</I>&gt;<i>  - Time to select a widget (because of the time required to display the
</I>&gt;<i>    widget in the editor)
</I>&gt;<i>  - Time to set a property (when changing label text for instance, is
</I>&gt;<i>    it very slow when typing in the property editor entry ?)
</I>&gt;<i>  - Time to switch the active project (this should take virtually no time
</I>&gt;<i>    by now actually but used to be a bottle neck).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
In the order given:
 - Progress bar works, isn't extremely fast but not slow.
   About the same as selecting a widget. Note that this was a small
&quot;project&quot;.
 - Time to select a widget (of a different type than the one before) is
very long.
 - Setting properties is instantly quick.
 - Switching the active project is very slow, same as selecting a widget.

So, please let us know, how fast is your processor ? are you running Glade
&gt;<i> alone
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The CPU is a terrible little Atom N260 (1.66 GHz, one core, two threads).
Running Glade alone or not makes no difference.
On the mentioned &quot;slow&quot; actions, CPU usage jumps to ~42%.

Also, Qt Creator and Designer work flawlessly in terms of speed,
so the CPU should be able to handle it, right?


&gt;<i> or is firefox processing evil scripts for gmail sending your
</I>&gt;<i> information to spy agencies ?
</I>

Is this a joke or should I be concerned?


&gt;<i> How much ram do you have... is Glade causing your machine to 'swap' memory
</I>&gt;<i> ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I have 1GiB of RAM. Glade is using 32 MiB of it.
At this time there's over 700 MiB of free memory available.

Thank you,
Matej
