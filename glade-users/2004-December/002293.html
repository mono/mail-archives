Yes.  But after you have done the first &quot;make install&quot; as long as you do
not edit the glade file you can just run ./src/myapp and it will pick up
the glade file from where you installed it.

Normally how I work is by doing:

	./configure --prefix=$HOME/tmp/install
	make install
	$HOME/tmp/install/bin/myapp

Doing the make install rather than just make adds a little bit of
overhead, but not a huge amount.

Note that if you start to use other GTK+ and GNOME technologies you will
need to install your app to test it, for example .desktop files, mime
handling, GConf, GtkUIManager, etc.

Keith.
