<PRE>&gt;<i> Hello Glade people!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Hi

[...]
&gt;<i> -The GUI I am testing this with has a GTKAboutDialog. The dialog displays
</I>&gt;<i> fine, with an image, license data and authors.
</I>&gt;<i> However, the website label (displayed as a button in the interface designer)
</I>&gt;<i> becomes a mere label with the URL of my web site. (It is not clicky). Why
</I>&gt;<i> would this be?
</I>
Not sure, are you running your app in the same environment as you
ran glade ? widgets can react differently when 
   a.) the underlying lib is of a different version
   b.) libgnomeui is initialized
   c.) some resources are discovered (maybe the link is only clickable
       with a known web browser running ?)

&gt;<i> Also, and perhaps more importantly, I can't figure out how to assign a
</I>&gt;<i> signal handler for the dialog's Close button! Clicking it does nothing
</I>&gt;<i> normally. I have tried adding a handler to the &quot;close&quot; signal (in GTKDialog)
</I>&gt;<i> for the About window, but it is not triggered.
</I>
usually a dialog is &quot;run&quot; and &quot;close&quot; is just one of the possible
responses of the dialog.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -Those configurable menu accelerators are an awesome feature. Do they
</I>&gt;<i> require libgnome to work?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -Where can I find out what all these signals mean? For example, &quot;realize&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and &quot;unrealize&quot; baffle me.
</I>
use DevHelp or browse the online docs here <A HREF="http://www.gtk.org/api/">http://www.gtk.org/api/</A>

signals that are internal to the widget implementation details
(such as &quot;realize&quot;) usually have less of a chance of being well
documented, but normally signals that are of significance to the
programmer are documented.

&gt;<i> -I find myself overriding all of my programs' windows' delete signal
</I>&gt;<i> handlers and adding gtk_true to them, instead having the windows hide /
</I>&gt;<i> appear when needed rather than be generated on the spot. Is this normal? Can
</I>&gt;<i> I speed this along and have the signals added by default rather than do it
</I>&gt;<i> manually every time?
</I>
add gtk_widget_hide() as the callback for the delete signal ?

&gt;<i> -In the Glade Interface Designer, where I set up signal handlers, there is a
</I>&gt;<i> check box that says &quot;After.&quot; What does that option do?
</I>
it adds G_CONNECT_AFTER to the connect flags when connecting, see
<A HREF="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gobject/gobject-Signals.html">http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gobject/gobject-Signals.html</A> .

Cheers,
                 -Tristan
