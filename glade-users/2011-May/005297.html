<PRE>There are no gtk.actions in your glade file.  I suggest you study
gtk.actions, because the example you cited uses them.

Also, you might study whether the automatic signal connections are
sufficient (when you invoke &quot;gtk_builder_connect_signals (builder,
NULL);&quot;).  My understanding is that the example you cite doesn't show
how to make the  connections, but is suggesting that when the
connections are made, you need to pass a struct that contains a
reference to the actions and a reference to your text widgets.  It seems
to me that automatic connections could not be passing that struct
because it does not know about it.  IOW the &quot;user data&quot; portion of a
signal is something you have to construct yourself and if used, requires
you to manually connect a signal.

Sorry, this could be wrong, I can't give you a better answer because I
am not an expert.
