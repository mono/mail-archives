<PRE>Hi! I have just converted myself (at last!!) to Linux, RedHat release 7,
to be exact.
I have been using things like C++Builder by Borland under Win
environments, and I saw that glade does the equivalent of the designing
part and file creation. When I go to edit the files to make my
application actually DO something, though, I am faced with a problem. I
must confess I'm not a wiz (just yet, hopefully), hence this is a very
basic question.
I'll give you an example of what I wanna do, so you can help me
directly, and I can learn from the example...

I have a button, called btnSaluta, I want the user to press that button
and subsequently change the text displayed in a label called lblOutput
on the same window as the button (window1, and on a panel fixed1).
I made an event handler for the &quot;pressed&quot; state of the button,
automatically called on_btnSaluta_pressed stored in a file called
callbacks.c

If I try to change the  text attribute of the lblOutput (which, if I'm
not wrong, I try to do with lblOutput-&gt;text), it says lblOutput is
undeclared.

My question is, how do I access the widgets on my form from this
callbacks file?
Also, is there no documentation about how to use glade? My &quot;Help&quot;
section in glade contains only the &quot;About&quot; option...

Thanking you in advance,
                                                        Alex
