It isn't.  I have a recently published book on &quot;Linkers and Loaders&quot;
which contains a discussion, and includes some of the details.  I'm not
entirely sure you can provide generic C++ name manging support, as from
the description they gave it dosn't sound like all the details are
standardised (templates etc. Are a major problem here).  But I would
probably be looking to the g++ team maybe they have some doco' on how
g++ does it, which might be adequate for a start.
