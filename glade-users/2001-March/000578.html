I strongly recommend you take a look at

<A HREF="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/glib/index.html">http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/glib/index.html</A>

Read the entire thing, it will amply repay the time investment.  In the
specific case of string concatination you would have found the answer in
glib-string-utility-functions, specifically g_strdup_printf().  

As far as basic (and advanced) Gtk+ syntax and data types I would
suggest you take a look at <A HREF="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/GGAD/">http://developer.gnome.org/doc/GGAD/</A> there
also appears to be an Italian translation, although not speaking italian
myself, I can't vouch for it's quality.  The english version however
will cover almost everything you require.
