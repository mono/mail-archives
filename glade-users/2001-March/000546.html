There isn't anything like this at present.
I've been sent a patch which does something quite similar - it adds &quot;Numeric&quot;
and &quot;Upper Case&quot; options to GtkEntry in Glade. Thes ignore non-numeric
characters and convert to upper case respectively.

I'm not sure if we should add something like this to Glade, or if we should
wait for it to be added to GTK+.

A few issues:

 o What should happen when an invalid character is entered? Is it silently
   ignored or should a dialog pop up saying &quot;The format should be 'xxxx'&quot;

 o If you sete the mask to 9999-09-09 how would it be displayed initially?
   Would it show &quot;    -  -  &quot;, and then let you type over it. (This would
   need changes to the way GtkEntry works.) Or is the user expected to type
   in the '-' characters. This would be too difficult for the user.

I'm a bit unsure of adding it to Glade, since if GTK+ includes such a feature
in future it could well be slightly different.
