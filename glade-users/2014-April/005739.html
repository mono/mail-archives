<PRE>I have some troubles in debugging a program in which I do use a glade file 
for creating the GUI. The problem is the fact that I cannot find the reason 
why the Do_Connect function fails. The normal reason I found was that the 
names of the handlers in the glade file and in the program file are not 
completely the same. I now have the problem that I introduced a new dialog 
within an existing glade file with two buttons that have a &quot;clicked&quot; 
activation. Afterwards I did not pass the Do_Connect routine but when I made 
sure the handler names were the same by a copy/paste operation it still did 
not work. My problem is that I cannot find a way to get the the program  to 
tell me what creates the trouble. At this moment I have stripped all events 
from the glade file and commented all register handlers out but the programs 
still stops at the do_connect routine. Icannot enter the routine with the 
GPS debugger, so what is the best way to handle the problem. Starting all 
over again in a program of several thousands of program lines is certainly 
not the best way.
