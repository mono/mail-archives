<PRE>I would like to have a widget, created in glade, that acts like a
button in that it gets button-press-event, and has a stock image, but
does not have any text label.

A GtkToolButton almost fits the bill, in that it has an image but no text.

However, if you put signal handlers on a GtkToolButton, you can see
when it is clicked, or gets a button-released-event, but the
button-pressed-events are unreliable.   In my setup, they only show up
for double clicks.

On the other hand a GtkButton certainly does get button-pressed-event
and button-released-event, but if it's a stock button, there does not
seem to be a way to tell it to just not show any text.

I would like to do this entirely in glade, without writing any code,
and using only standard images.

Is this possible?

I'm using xubuntu 16.04, and the glade which comes with it which is 3.18.3.

Thanks in advance for any clues, and i can provide more details if i'm
leaving something out here.
