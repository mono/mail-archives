This really sounds like a system problem.  Think of it this way, why  
would the binary executable have anything to do with glade?  Glade just  
constructs the GUI and maybe the code if you let it, that's it.

Email me offlist and I'll see what I can do to help.  Send whatever  
errors you are getting, glade version, gtk version number, gnome  
version number, and what OS you are using.  It all makes a difference.

Cheers,

Rikke
