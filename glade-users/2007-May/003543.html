<PRE>Thank you very much for your reply.

 &gt; Hi, the DnD is not restricted to any granularity like it is in glade 2,
 &gt; if you didnt manage to find DnD support, currently its only working
 &gt; with the SHIFT modifier (you'll get mouse feedback) and works with
 &gt; GtkTable,GtkBox,GtkLayout &amp; GtkFixed (we'll be making that feature
 &gt; more obvious for 3.4 by adding a toggle button for selection mode).

I already read about the SHIFT modifier on the news page. So is there 
any way to adjust the &quot;granularity&quot; of DnD?

 &gt; Yes thats a known bug, currently you cant select comboboxes in the
 &gt; workspace - you can workaround this by selecting it in the inspector for
 &gt; now (I'm not sure how glade 2 works around the combobox's intrusive 
popup window but we apperently should be able to do the same).

Selecting a combobox in the inspector does not work either. Working with 
comboboxes works with glade 2 by employing some tricks like selecting 
them with two clicks or by selecting the border. But however, I'm happy 
that this is a known bug and supposed to be fixed in the future :-)

Greetings,
Mario
