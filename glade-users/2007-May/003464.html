Standards?..Must be just me, but could you elaborate on that..
Do you mean something like
username = foo
password = bar
keep these variables in a file which your application can read and login to
the database with the given credentials..
Hmmm..Won't a simple text file do the job..You could prolly name it
dndrc.conf or something and keep it in /etc/ while make installing the app
for a global setting or the user's home directory if its a per-user setting,
like '.dndrc'. Thats one standard I am aware of.

&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;<i> I have been looking for books on programming and have gone through
</I>&gt;<i> the entire Devhelp to no avail. I did find gconf but it has only Two
</I>&gt;<i> functions... not exactly a lot for the programming tasks I require...
</I>
gconf is for gnome-applications and you probably wouldn't want it if its a
non-gnome application.

A noobie programmer
