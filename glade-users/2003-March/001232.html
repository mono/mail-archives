Hello everyone,

I tried all the posted for my problem with autogen.sh. But none worked :(

The intl/Makefile.in keeps being deleted when I run autogen.sh.

I ran into the Make files and removed all &quot;intl&quot; entries, but no good either... But I´m no expert at Makefiles and Flags!

There is no mention of &quot;./intl&quot; anywhere in Glade configuration, so I suppose Glade should handle it without a problem. And as far as I know I´m the only one having this problem... right? Should anyone have had it already, I would appreciate any help with that and personal experiences too.

See people, I´m a DOS ANSI C programmer and I am trying hard to migrate to C/C++ on Linux :-} Those makefile things are too complicated!

 

Well, I´ll try harder those advices some have given me. I´ll try to twig out those flags :)

I also get something like &quot;missing separator&quot; when a modify Makefile. But I don´t know what separator that might be.

PS: gettextize really creates intl/ and all its files, but autogen.sh deletes intl/Makefile.in   sooooo... What the hell!!!


&quot;Dreams are such stuff as we are made on&quot;
