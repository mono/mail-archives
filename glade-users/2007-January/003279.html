In the button-press signal handler call g_timeout_add() to add a
function to be called at regular intervals. (Make sure you store the
returned timeout id as you'll need it to remove the timeout function.)

In the button-release handler call g_source_remove() to remove your
timeout, using its id. (You should also remove it if your window is
closed or destroyed.)
