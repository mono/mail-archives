</I>
Yes, I started working on glade 3 some 5 or 6 years ago because we
needed a way to integrate our custom gtk+ based toolkit into glade
(we were stuck using the old &quot;custom_widget&quot; hack to get our widgets
into the runtime).

Heres a screen shot of our jukebox interface being edited in glade:

Now my memory is failing me, but I dont know what company its
called now, or who own them or what (so sue me :D), but the company
that was at one time PalmSource, had created a lightweight gtk+ based
toolkit and integrated that into glade, so they could use glade to
create interfaces for the handheld/cellphone.

Note in this case, they had written a binary compiler/interpreter to replace
libglade in the actual system, to avoid processing xml and the added dependancy
on libxml2, now that we have GtkBuilder, which uses a GMarkup parser,
this I assume would no longer be an issue.

&gt;<i> 2. Is glade still active? I see the last release of 3.0 was in 2006.
</I>
We are quite active yes, I completely skipped the last gnome release cycle
for one reason: GtkBuilder file format support - it was a requirement that
fell out of the sky and I had no choice but to prioritize on, and so
since I have
to do it myself - its taking a while - but I would say that from when I started
on builder support, I'm at about 85% ;-)

Cheers,
                    -Tristan
