Sorry didn't CC the mailing list...

Oh yeah having a common builder would be pretty good. The problem I have
is that once you have used the dialog from builder you end up soiling
the builders copy for future use. My technique has always just been to
(perhaps foolishly) create a new builder to fetch a fresh version of the
dialog.

Maybe a better technique would be to copy the dialogs from the builder,
hence keeping the builder pristine. Looking at the attribute listing of
the generated dialogs (I'm using python by the way) it has copy as used
by the python module `copy', but I cannot get this working. I imagine
gobject must have its own copy system, perhaps I should search the C
API. This is kind of moving into GTK issues of dialog/widget management.

This might be a good topic for a wiki or tutorial, &quot;Glade 3 and multiple
dialogs&quot; or &quot;GTK Builder and multiple dialogs&quot;. Since the examples I've
found
(<A HREF="http://www.micahcarrick.com/12-24-2007/gtk-glade-tutorial-part-1.html">http://www.micahcarrick.com/12-24-2007/gtk-glade-tutorial-part-1.html</A>)
only cover storing single dialogs in glade, then rely on generating
prefab dialogs on the fly. Which really only covers the most basic
applications.
