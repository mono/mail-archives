Im not exactly sure how gtkbuilder works in that respect, Im sure though
that for you builder using dialog class, it wouldnt be hard to install the
builder as class-wide data...

Ive heard of people using your dialog approach before, sounds sane
enough to me... as for saving in multiple or the same file, it shouldnt
make much difference, you can always split them using copy/paste
across projects in glade in the future, and now glade trunk allows
you to choose a naming scheme to let you have names unique by
toplevel instead of project wide...

... although I should say, recent tests show that with really huge
interfaces glade can be slow at load time (about a minute to load
a glade file of ~1600 widgets) ... I still have to get around to writing
a progress bar for that ;-)

Cheers,
