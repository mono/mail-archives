Hi everybody,

I am new to Glade and this list as well. Glade is fantastic tool for
development! I have one query on how to set text form one app to another.

I have created two application windows in glade: app1 and app2. A button on
app1 opens app2 window. I have &quot;clist&quot; on app2 and want to set text in &quot;text
entry&quot; area of app1 when row in &quot;clist&quot; in app2 is selected and OK button on
app2 is clicked. While I am able to read data from &quot;clist&quot; and I too know
how to write in &quot;text_entry&quot; area. The problem is - I don't know how to
reference GtkWidget from app2 to app1. Is &quot;lookup_widget&quot; ok for this? Can
any body give example of code for it.

I would appreciate any help on this matter. Thanks in advance.

Best Regards,

Rajesh Padalia
