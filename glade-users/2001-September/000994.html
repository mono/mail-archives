<PRE>Problem solved now. The gtk/ and gdk/ library directories as well as the
glib.h file were not in their correct locations. Strangely enough, since I
haven't touched any of them since install. So, either the gtk1.2 and glib1.2
don't end up in the correct locations on install, or gdk-- and whatever else
is using them are wrong about where they ought to be. Anyone else
experienced this problem? It was easy enough to remedy, just made a few
symlinks, but still. It seems to me that every other time you try to compile
something (my system is a Red Hat linux 7.1 btw, and I haven't tampered with
it, honestly) you end up having to fiddle with the system in one way or the
other. Thought I'd be safe just having reinstalled the system from scratch,
but noo...

Anyway, thanks once more for the swift and accurate help.
/Emil

Thanks a lot, that seemed to do the trick. Now autogen.sh works alright, but
when I type 'make' afterwards, I get a bunch of complaints about missing
include
files. Guess I have to check that I have all necessary libraries installed
(in
the right places).

Thanks again / Emil
