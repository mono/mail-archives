<PRE>Hi,

Yes it has definitely cleared my doubts. Thnka for it. I am now going thr=
ouch the book on &quot;Applied Cryptography&quot;. Thanks for the help. =


I am currently creating a windows-style setup for my project; but I am st=
uck in the part of a directory browser. I want a directory browser instea=
d of a file browser. The fileselection dialog does not have features to m=
ake invisible the files. please suggest what i should do.

Regards,
Shivdeep
