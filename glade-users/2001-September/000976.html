<PRE>Hello,
	I am trying to build a project (with a glade interface).  The project was built when glade-- was not supporting a lot of widgets we were using so we were outputting regular c code, compiling everything with the g++ compiler, linking and we were all happy ;)

	However, we have just upgraded to RH 7.1 with the 2.96 compiler.  Up to the 2.95 compiler, we could (with the -pedantic option) get everything to compile with a few warnings to interface.c.

	Now, with 2.96, warnings have become errors.  Is there a way to get the file to compile ?  Since many of the callbacks we use require access to libraries (C++) we can't just build the whole thing with gcc.

	I would really appreciate if anyone has any idea on how to use g++ to make interface.c compile correctly.  Thanks in advance !
