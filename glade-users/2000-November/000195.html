Well I was not explaining myself very well.. in fact I mean locks in the
calls.. bad pseudocode.. sorry.
 
&gt;<i> I'm curious ... please read the following web pages from end to end and
</I>&gt;<i> then tell me how you can justify this additional effort of threads ...
</I>&gt;<i> 'cause I haven't yet found a good justification.

Ok... you have very good points.. in fact the only advantage in a single
cpu system could be to &quot;steal&quot; more cpu time and cheat the scheduler.. (of
course depending of the implementation).. but this could be achieved more
seriosly giving more priority to the proccess.. 

But I agree.. locks gets a lot of overhead.. and context-switching is
really painfull..

But the same arguments could be applied to an multi-proccess model (such
as a http server like apache) why to fork? we could manage all with a
single proccess an events handlers.. OK the first reason is to isolate
memory usage which is not an excuse in a threaded model.. and once again
to &quot;steal&quot; more cpu time which we see is not a real excuse neither... 

And now my question.. What are multi-threading good for in a linux system
with a single cpu? and for what are they really good in a SMP system?.. we
could give a single-proccess abstraction to the programer using a
well-designed kernel-api.

Very good... threads maybe are computer science &quot;masturbation&quot; or maybe
there are too much people with a lot of spare time ;)

To be or not to be... :)

Roberto
