 0.6.2

Never did find this.

I finally found this after changing from 'vertical button box' to 
single buttons in a table. The homogeneous doesn't appear for the 
verticle button box that I could find.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 4. Buttons also have a 'EXPAND'.  Make sure it is turned off.
</I>
Found this in the buttons in a table but not the 'verticle button box'.


Anyway I was able to achieve the effect I wanted using the tables and 
inserting buttons into the table. I could get them to pack together witout
spaces that way. Never could get the 'veticle button box' to put the buttons
next to each other without spaces.

I sure would like to find that resize option though.   (:

Thanks for all the help.

As Arnold so poetically said: &quot;I'll be back&quot;    (:

Later
