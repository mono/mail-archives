</I>Yes, with regularity.

&gt;<i> Man, people have to tell me these things, I admit, after moving mountains

</I>I wish I was a good enough programmer to take a shot at that but for me
it was a big deal just to learn to use GTK and Glade.

&gt;<i> fix the crashes in Glade 3.6, and to my satisfaction there are zero
</I>&quot;I can't get no satisfaction...&quot;

&gt;<i> No this issue is completely unknown to me, I am guessing

</I>It could be.  That is why I want to get 3.6.7 installed on a linux system
so I can try it there.

&gt;<i> It would be great if you filed one and explained how its reproducible.
</I>I have not yet been able to find any specific action that triggers it but it
seems that with time just about anything will do it.  I can open an existing
project and do nothing else but select one widget after another until it will
crash.  One time I was cutting individual labels and pasting them into a new
vertical box and that crashed.  Another time I put a new vertical button box
and put checkboxes into it which resulted in a crash.

I have very little experience with debugging tools and Gtk (gcc) but I would
like to take a shot at debugging this problem.  Could you guide me in getting
Glade to build/run in a debugging system?  I suppose that I would need to
build Glade 3.6.7 for debugging?
