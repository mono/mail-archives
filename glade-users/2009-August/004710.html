it CRASHES ???!!!!

Man, people have to tell me these things, I admit, after moving mountains
single-handedly to make 3.6 &quot;work at all&quot; with GtkBuilder, I really couldnt
care less about the horizonal orientation bug that nobody else apparently
cares enough about to fix anyway.

But crashes, I have dedicated alot of time since January this year to
fix the crashes in Glade 3.6, and to my satisfaction there are zero
crashes left to my knowlage (except for an unexplainable singularity
I which was reported about the inspector hangining indefinitely).

</I>
No this issue is completely unknown to me, I am guessing
its probably something to do with the windows build, because
I dont know of many people using that build at all.

It would be great if you filed one and explained how its reproducible.

Regards,
          -Tristan
