Ok, so if your names should not be unique you cant use the workaround
I suggested, sure.

As I said, the name not showing up for your object is bug, feel free
to file it.

I did not find the reason for the bug at a quick glance, I assure you
there is no deep reasoning for it not to work, just a special case that
needs to be tracked down probably in the plugin (from my pov, I
special case GtkWidget by disabling the name property explicitly).

Anyway, no point to bla bla bla about this, its just a bug.

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This would ofcourse only be satisfactory if its ok that your objects
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all receive a unique &quot;name&quot; value; otherwise feel free to file a bug
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about why we are not picking up the &quot;name&quot; property...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I understand that it probably was not a good idea to name the property
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;name&quot;, but on the other hand I don't really get it why GtkWidgets are
</I>&gt;<i> treated differently from any other GObject and their &quot;name&quot; property is
</I>&gt;<i> being bounded to the id, when all other objects survive perfectly fine
</I>&gt;<i> without even having that property. According to the docs the purpose of
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;name&quot; property is to apply certain style from gtkrc to the widget,
</I>&gt;<i> which implies that it does not have to be unique, rather otherwise. Now
</I>&gt;<i> GtkBuilder for no particular reason hijacks the property forcing it to
</I>&gt;<i> be set to the unique id, completely defeating the purpose. I'm afraid
</I>&gt;<i> this rather unfortunate bug has to be filed against gtk. Correct me if
</I>&gt;<i> my logic is flawed.
</I>
I think it might work out of the box already, GtkBuilder applies the
id to all widgets
via GtkBuildable; GtkWidgets sync the id to the name property.

But that doesnt mean that this type of construct:

  &lt;object class=&quot;GtkButton&quot; id=&quot;ok_button&quot;&gt;
     &lt;property name=&quot;name&quot;&gt;standard_button&lt;/property&gt;
     ...

... would not be valid.

Glade never handled a separate name but if the above proves
to work theres no reason why we couldnt add a &quot;theme name&quot; property
or such to explicitly set the name.

Cheers,
           -Tristan
