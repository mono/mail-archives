<PRE>Hello,

I noticed that MD 2.4 intellisense doesn't show the members for delegates
but only the inherited from System.Object. So I compiled MD and decide that
*CSharpTextEditorCompletion.CreateCompletionData() *would be a good start to
improve this functionality (I didn't see any open issue or bug regarding
this in the lists). So far I added something like:

            CSharpAmbience ambience = new CSharpAmbience ();
            IType type = dom.GetType (resolveResult.ResolvedType);

            string strType = ambience.GetString (type,
OutputFlags.ReformatDelegates | OutputFlags.IncludeParameterName |
OutputFlags.IncludeKeywords | OutputFlags.UseFullName);
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;Type is &quot; + strType);

            if (strType.StartsWith(&quot;delegate&quot;))
            {
                type.BaseType = new
DomReturnType(&quot;System.MulticastDelegate&quot;);
            }

in the mentioned method just to see if that works (and somehow it does). Of
course is not the solution because:

   - I think that the type should be assigned while the DOM structure is
   created and not in that method.
   - It doesn't generate (or simulate) the sealed class with the
members *BeginInvoke(),
   EndInvoke()*.

Right now I'm facing the first problem but honestly is a bit difficult to
work with the code since I don't clearly see how the classes interacts. So
the question is if you could briefly describe where do you think I should
make the first change (set the right DomReturnType to the delegates) or what
are the responsibilities of the classes involved in this functionality:
CSharpTextEditorCompletion, ProjectDom, Ambience, NRefactoryResolver,
ResolveResult

Thanks in advance,
D.
