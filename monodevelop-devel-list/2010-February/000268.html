Hi Juan:
            Welcome to the list :) I was working on db addin, right now i haven't got time and i stop working on it, but in the next couple of months i will try to get back to work. You are welcome to work on Sql Server Addin, I was having problem testing some couple  of fix on this addin beacause i haven't got any full (unlimited) access to Sql Server. The port on sql server connection dialog was introduced by me beacause i was having problems on servers with multiple sql version, i guess (didn't really remember) that it was disabled by default.

            If you have any question don't hesitate to ask me or the list and i will try to help you, i have a pending patch to get &quot;create database&quot; support on Sql Server, i have a lot of TODO's on the project (i could share this TODO), and need some optimizations/fix. I have a pending bug, but i was waiting to have mono DLinQ integration (which is already implemented).

Bye, Lucian0

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [Monodevelop-devel] I'm new on the list
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi everybody, I just want to introduce myself, my name is 
</I>&gt;<i> Juanfra and my nickname is pexi, I'm working as MSSQL DBA 
</I>&gt;<i> and SAP Netweaver administrator, I have written some 
</I>&gt;<i> applications on asp.net C# that improve my diary job, so I 
</I>&gt;<i> like to much the environment monodevelop, and I want help 
</I>&gt;<i> to improve the Monodevelop.Database extra, starting by 
</I>&gt;<i> SQL Server support because I know it better than another Databases. 
</I>&gt;<i> By the way I was reading the code of 
</I>&gt;<i> Monodevelop.Database.SQL.SqlServer and I find that it use 
</I>&gt;<i> sentences compatible with SQL Server 2000, and does not 
</I>&gt;<i> provide 100% compatibility with the new versions (SQL 2005 
</I>&gt;<i> and 2008).
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know what more can I say, only that I want to help 
</I>&gt;<i> you in this project, but I don't know how to begin (of 
</I>&gt;<i> course reading code, and following the guide 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://monodevelop.com/Developers">http://monodevelop.com/Developers</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that I could begin updating the sentences for SQL 
</I>&gt;<i> Server 2005/2008 and adding the support in the code to 
</I>&gt;<i> choose between versions. Other thing that could be improved 
</I>&gt;<i> is the support to connect without specifying the port, only 
</I>&gt;<i> SERVER\INSTANCE_NAME.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please let me know if this is a good point to start or not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> P.S.: Sorry about my English.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards
</I>&gt;<i> Pexi.
