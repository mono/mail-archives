The DOM changes have resulted in severe regressions in the ASP.NET
binding, among many other things (including C# completion,
refactoring, stetic, etc). The CodeBehind member generation is
completely broken, and will have to be ported to use the new DOM, as
will the BindingService and CodeRefactorer that it uses.

More importantly, the Parser infrastructure and the type/member lookup
used by the ASP.NET code completion is totally non-operational. As I'm
working on the ASP.NET code completion, this makes things difficult
for me. I can work around it for now, but I need this stuff to be
operational soon.

How soon are these likely to be fixed? Could we have a summary of the
changes that need to be made to existing code to port it to the new
parser infrastructure and DOM?

If these won't be fixed soon, I suggest that we move the changes into
a svn branch, and revert the changes on trunk. We could then remove
the old DOM and parser infrastructure in order to track down *ALL* the
places that need to be fixed, before merging back to trunk.
