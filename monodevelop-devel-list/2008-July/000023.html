<PRE>Hi. Just my 2 cents on this.

There are a lot of reasons too why programs don't use SQL database 
software. Maintainability gets hurt also by adopting such a solution in 
a OOP world; I guess you have heard about the Impedance mismatch [1], 
hence the existance of complicated ORM [2] frameworks or OOP databases 
like DB4O [3] (which in particular could be a better bet, but I guess 
the license is not adequate for MD).

I'm also worried about the fact that your opinion about SQLite may be 
biased because I guess you only used Win32 OS when you were working in 
SharpDevelop, right? There has been huge performance problems (locking 
problems) with SQLite in Linux, which recently caused a lot of 
discussions due to its usage in Firefox (which BTW is performing for me 
a lot worse than other browsers in Linux). I can't give you the exact 
reference of where I read (but I can give you some first google hits 
like [4] and [5]) it but AFAIK this is yet a problem to be solved 
upstream (don't remember if it's in the kernel or in the extX filesystem).

Regards,

    Andr&#233;s
