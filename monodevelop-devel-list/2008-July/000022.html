</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; This discussion should have been done before committing anything to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; trunk, but here it is anyway.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Migrating to SQLite only makes sense if it provides noticeable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; improvements in performance and memory use. Guessing that it will be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; better is not enough. We need real numbers before taking the decision
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; switch, and only do it if the numbers are so much better that pay off
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the burden of having a dependency on SQLite.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I might be wrong, but I don't believe that SQLite will be better than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the ad-hoc database we are using in MD 1.0. I spent a lot of time
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; tuning
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; up the parser database, and I'm quite happy about how is it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; performing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Some more benefits for using a real database over an own implementation:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#65279;- It's reliable. Atomic transactions, threading - all solved.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Transactions and threading are not a problem for the parser database, so
</I>&gt;<i> that's not a real benefit.
</I>
Multithreaded *writes* could be useful if we're parsing on multiple
cores, but those aren't going to happen with SQLite just yet anyway...

&gt;&gt;<i> - It's easy to look into the data using a command line client and SQL
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> statements
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is cool, but it has never been a requirement.
</I>
I found this appealing :-)

&gt;&gt;<i> Its not just pure performance. Using a database will allow us for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> example to switch the database software to a new implementation. And
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> databases and SQL are very easy to understood and to change.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I had to think about it too (I implemented the #develop database some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> years ago which monodevelop inherited (but optimized I admit ^^)) -
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's not correct, MD's parser database was written from scratch. The
</I>&gt;<i> inherited implementation would load everything in memory and would
</I>&gt;<i> collapse the system trying to open the MD solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> after thinking about it the decision was easy - A database makes it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easier to change the model and to make complicated querys more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> efficient.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But curiously they are especially bad at querying hierarchies of objects
</I>&gt;<i> (such as namespace hierarchies or subclass hierarchies), unless you
</I>&gt;<i> denormalize the tables.
</I>
Isn't that true of an ad-hoc DB too?

&gt;<i> Yes, databases are powerful. They can do amazing things with little
</I>&gt;<i> effort. But generic databases don't fit everywhere. A well designed
</I>&gt;<i> ad-hoc database may be better than a generic RDBMS, even if less
</I>&gt;<i> powerful. Everything depends on the requirements and constraints of the
</I>&gt;<i> application. For the specific case of the parser database, here are some
</I>&gt;<i> requirements:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      * Type and namespace lookup must be lightning fast. Type and
</I>&gt;<i>        namespace queries are used by the parser when resolving types,
</I>&gt;<i>        and by code completion when showing completion entries. I don't
</I>&gt;<i>        think we can afford hitting the disk for that kind of queries.
</I>
AFAIK, SQLite maintains an in-memory cache of configurable size, so as
long as the databases are properly indexed, this shouldn't be an
issue.

&gt;<i>      * Most of operations are read operations, so the database must be
</I>&gt;<i>        optimized for reading. Write operations are much less common
</I>&gt;<i>        than reads.
</I>
This is true of SQLite.

&gt;<i>      * The data is the database is discardable. It is always possible
</I>&gt;<i>        to regenerate a database by re-parsing a project or an assembly.
</I>&gt;<i>      * Memory usage must be contained. Project and assembly databases
</I>&gt;<i>        may contain a huge amount of information.
</I>&gt;<i>      * The set of queries that it has to support is known and limited.
</I>&gt;<i>        Those are basically:
</I>&gt;<i>              * Get all types.
</I>&gt;<i>              * Get all types implemented in a file, given the file
</I>&gt;<i>                name.
</I>&gt;<i>              * Get all subclasses of a class, given class name.
</I>&gt;<i>              * Get a type, given the type name.
</I>&gt;<i>              * Get all types and sub-namespaces of a namespace.
</I>&gt;<i>              * Get all sub-namespaces of a namespace.
</I>
I would also like to be able to extend the parser DB to store the
C/C++ symbols. This should be relatively easy with SQLite.

It would also be nice to store the amount of times a particular item
has been selected from the code completion list, so that if there are
a number of completion entries that match the currently typed prefix,
the completion window can select the most likely one. Visual Studio
does this and it's *very* useful. Things like this would be pretty
easy to implement with SQLite. We could also maintain various other
tables and indices to accelerate things like &quot;find references&quot;, which
would help with speeding up renaming and other such refactorings.

&gt;<i> A designer has to find the solution that better fulfills the constraints
</I>&gt;<i> and requirements of an application. In the parser case, given the
</I>&gt;<i> constraints we have, I think an ad-hoc database may perform better. Of
</I>&gt;<i> course I might be wrong, since I haven't done any tests with SQLite, but
</I>&gt;<i> I yet have to see a proof of the contrary.
</I>
This is a fair point, and we should definitely perform benchmarks
before coming to a conclusion.

&gt;&gt;<i> There are many more reasons using database software instead of own data
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> storage solutions - otherwise the whole database software would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> obsolete.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are also many more reasons for not using databases, otherwise all
</I>&gt;<i> applications would be using them.
</I>
The main reason I prefer SQLite would be maintainability; I found the
old parser database to be somewhat hard to understand when I was
trying to fix problems.

However, I fully agree that if the performance tests show that the
ad-hoc database is significantly faster and/or less memory hungry,
it's probably worth the effort of maintaining it.
