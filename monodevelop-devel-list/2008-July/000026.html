That's because Firefox uses SQLite in synchronous mode, which flushes
to disk (and ext3 causes ALL files on the disk to be flushed). We
wouldn't need that mode. Firefix also seems to write a huge amount of
daya to disk compared to what it needs, probably for the same reason
(excessive flushing of indices, etc)

It'd be fairer to compare Banshee, which opens its database with:
Execute (&quot;PRAGMA cache_size = ?&quot;, cache_size);
Execute (&quot;PRAGMA synchronous = OFF&quot;);
Execute (&quot;PRAGMA temp_store = MEMORY&quot;);
Execute (&quot;PRAGMA count_changes = OFF&quot;);

(see banshee/src/Core/Banshee.Services/Banshee.Database/BansheeDbConnection.cs)

Banshee's database has not caused any substantial problems.
