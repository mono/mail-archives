</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Hi
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; This discussion should have been done before committing anything to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; trunk, but here it is anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; Migrating to SQLite only makes sense if it provides noticeable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; improvements in performance and memory use. Guessing that it will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; better is not enough. We need real numbers before taking the decision
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; switch, and only do it if the numbers are so much better that pay off
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; the burden of having a dependency on SQLite.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; I might be wrong, but I don't believe that SQLite will be better than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; the ad-hoc database we are using in MD 1.0. I spent a lot of time
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; tuning
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; up the parser database, and I'm quite happy about how is it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; performing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Some more benefits for using a real database over an own implementation:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &#65279;- It's reliable. Atomic transactions, threading - all solved.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Transactions and threading are not a problem for the parser database, so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that's not a real benefit.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Multithreaded *writes* could be useful if we're parsing on multiple
</I>&gt;<i> cores, but those aren't going to happen with SQLite just yet anyway...
</I>
It isn't a real benefit, given the low rate of writes we require.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - It's easy to look into the data using a command line client and SQL
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; statements
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is cool, but it has never been a requirement.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I found this appealing :-)
</I>
Me too, but software design can't be driven by appealingness.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Its not just pure performance. Using a database will allow us for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; example to switch the database software to a new implementation. And
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; databases and SQL are very easy to understood and to change.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I had to think about it too (I implemented the #develop database some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; years ago which monodevelop inherited (but optimized I admit ^^)) -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's not correct, MD's parser database was written from scratch. The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inherited implementation would load everything in memory and would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; collapse the system trying to open the MD solution.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; after thinking about it the decision was easy - A database makes it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; easier to change the model and to make complicated querys more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; efficient.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But curiously they are especially bad at querying hierarchies of objects
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (such as namespace hierarchies or subclass hierarchies), unless you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; denormalize the tables.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Isn't that true of an ad-hoc DB too?
</I>
Not always. A hierarchy of objects can be efficiently scanned in memory
without 'denormalizing' it.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, databases are powerful. They can do amazing things with little
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; effort. But generic databases don't fit everywhere. A well designed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ad-hoc database may be better than a generic RDBMS, even if less
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; powerful. Everything depends on the requirements and constraints of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; application. For the specific case of the parser database, here are some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; requirements:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      * Type and namespace lookup must be lightning fast. Type and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        namespace queries are used by the parser when resolving types,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        and by code completion when showing completion entries. I don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        think we can afford hitting the disk for that kind of queries.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> AFAIK, SQLite maintains an in-memory cache of configurable size, so as
</I>&gt;<i> long as the databases are properly indexed, this shouldn't be an
</I>&gt;<i> issue.
</I>
Shouldn't, but we don't know.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      * Most of operations are read operations, so the database must be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        optimized for reading. Write operations are much less common
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        than reads.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is true of SQLite.
</I>
This is a design constraint to take into account to choose the right
solution. I'm not saying that this is a problem in SQLite.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      * The data is the database is discardable. It is always possible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        to regenerate a database by re-parsing a project or an assembly.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      * Memory usage must be contained. Project and assembly databases
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        may contain a huge amount of information.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      * The set of queries that it has to support is known and limited.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        Those are basically:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;              * Get all types.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;              * Get all types implemented in a file, given the file
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                name.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;              * Get all subclasses of a class, given class name.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;              * Get a type, given the type name.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;              * Get all types and sub-namespaces of a namespace.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;              * Get all sub-namespaces of a namespace.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would also like to be able to extend the parser DB to store the
</I>&gt;<i> C/C++ symbols. This should be relatively easy with SQLite.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would also be nice to store the amount of times a particular item
</I>&gt;<i> has been selected from the code completion list, so that if there are
</I>&gt;<i> a number of completion entries that match the currently typed prefix,
</I>&gt;<i> the completion window can select the most likely one. Visual Studio
</I>&gt;<i> does this and it's *very* useful. Things like this would be pretty
</I>&gt;<i> easy to implement with SQLite.
</I>
And with an ad-hoc database even easier. I don't think VS needs a
relational database to implement this.

&gt;<i> We could also maintain various other
</I>&gt;<i> tables and indices to accelerate things like &quot;find references&quot;, which
</I>&gt;<i> would help with speeding up renaming and other such refactorings.
</I>
Again, you don't have to convince me about how cool having all that info
in a database is. I already know it.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A designer has to find the solution that better fulfills the constraints
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and requirements of an application. In the parser case, given the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; constraints we have, I think an ad-hoc database may perform better. Of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; course I might be wrong, since I haven't done any tests with SQLite, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I yet have to see a proof of the contrary.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a fair point, and we should definitely perform benchmarks
</I>&gt;<i> before coming to a conclusion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; There are many more reasons using database software instead of own data
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; storage solutions - otherwise the whole database software would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; obsolete.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There are also many more reasons for not using databases, otherwise all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; applications would be using them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The main reason I prefer SQLite would be maintainability; I found the
</I>&gt;<i> old parser database to be somewhat hard to understand when I was
</I>&gt;<i> trying to fix problems.
</I>
Yes, it is hard to understand because it is complex, and it is complex
because it is solving a complex problem. We should refrain the urge of
rewriting all complex software we find, since there may be a good reason
for it being complex.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, I fully agree that if the performance tests show that the
</I>&gt;<i> ad-hoc database is significantly faster and/or less memory hungry,
</I>&gt;<i> it's probably worth the effort of maintaining it.
</I>
And if tests show that SQLite is better than the ad-hoc database, I also
agree on using it.

Lluis.
