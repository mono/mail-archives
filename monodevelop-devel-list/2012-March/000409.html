<PRE>If you look at
<A HREF="http://haacked.com/archive/2011/01/06/razor-syntax-quick-reference.aspx">http://haacked.com/archive/2011/01/06/razor-syntax-quick-reference.aspx</A> you'll
see that even syntax-highlighting isn't a simple task, as there are many
conditions for transitioning between html and code blocks and back in the
syntax, but yes it is the simplest goal. Code completion is a lot harder
and I don't think the individual parsers for HTML and C# are easily
reusable, as there is some difficulty in keeping a sane shared context for
both, probably it would be needed a refactoring of both to accommodate the
needs of a Razor-compatible code completion engine.

Said that some partial goals can be set and achieved towards enabling
editing Razor views, and on the general workflow of creating a MVC 3 app in
MonoDevelop. Don't give up.

Fun,

&gt;<i>  Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My name is Peter and I&#8217;d like to participate in developing MD under GSoC
</I>&gt;<i> 2012. I have some experience in web development in .NET hence the projects
</I>&gt;<i> related to ASP .NET MVC draw my attention. I&#8217;m particularly interested in
</I>&gt;<i> adding Razor syntax support to Mono Develop &#8211; syntax highlighting, code
</I>&gt;<i> completion, new project templates etc. - but I have some questions that
</I>&gt;<i> hopefully could be answered by more experienced developers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My questions are generally about the difficulty of the task. I started
</I>&gt;<i> browsing the code and investigating the add-ins. I&#8217;ve also read several
</I>&gt;<i> articles for developers but I can&#8217;t precisely assess the complexity of the
</I>&gt;<i> Razor support task. I think that adding syntax highlighting wouldn&#8217;t be too
</I>&gt;<i> hard, but a good Razor parser and code completion seems to me a bit
</I>&gt;<i> challenging.  Am I right or is it just the wrong impression? Will it be
</I>&gt;<i> possible to use the existing ASP and HTML parsers to provide Razor syntax
</I>&gt;<i> support?  I&#8217;d be grateful for some feedback so that I could prepare a
</I>&gt;<i> feasible timeline for my application.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;d also like to ask if you have any other ideas related to mvc, maybe of
</I>&gt;<i> greater importance than Razor, that you would like to have implemented.
</I>&gt;<i> Support for MVC 3 from your tasks list seems like an important thing to me.
</I>&gt;<i> What features in this area are most important to you? Adding new templates
</I>&gt;<i> and project types that guarantee building and running mvc 3 without any
</I>&gt;<i> hacks, bug fixing, maybe something else?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks in advance for your help.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Piotr Dowgiallo
