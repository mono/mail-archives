<PRE>Hi,

My name is Peter and I&#8217;d like to participate in developing MD under GSoC 
2012. I have some experience in web development in .NET hence the 
projects related to ASP .NET MVC draw my attention. I&#8217;m particularly 
interested in adding Razor syntax support to Mono Develop &#8211; syntax 
highlighting, code completion, new project templates etc. - but I have 
some questions that hopefully could be answered by more experienced 
developers.

My questions are generally about the difficulty of the task. I started 
browsing the code and investigating the add-ins. I&#8217;ve also read several 
articles for developers but I can&#8217;t precisely assess the complexity of 
the Razor support task. I think that adding syntax highlighting wouldn&#8217;t 
be too hard, but a good Razor parser and code completion seems to me a 
bit challenging.  Am I right or is it just the wrong impression? Will it 
be possible to use the existing ASP and HTML parsers to provide Razor 
syntax support?  I&#8217;d be grateful for some feedback so that I could 
prepare a feasible timeline for my application.

I&#8217;d also like to ask if you have any other ideas related to mvc, maybe 
of greater importance than Razor, that you would like to have 
implemented. Support for MVC 3 from your tasks list seems like an 
important thing to me. What features in this area are most important to 
you? Adding new templates and project types that guarantee building and 
running mvc 3 without any hacks, bug fixing, maybe something else?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Regards,
Piotr Dowgiallo
