Yeah, a note on that - when I was looking at that I realized that
ApplicationData and LocalApplicationData have the wrong semantics on
Linux. The former maps to &quot;config&quot; and the latter maps to &quot;data&quot;,
instead of the remote/local distinction. Because of that, I avoided
using them, and implemented the XDG spec directly.

&gt;<i> The only comments/questions I'd have are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) For the sake of tidiness (reducing folders at a given level on a user's
</I>&gt;<i> machine) would it not be better to use &quot;MonoDevelop/version&quot; rather than
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;MonoDevelop-version&quot;? That way the user always gets just one MD folder
</I>
I considered that, but I think my way makes it clearer to the user
that old profiles still exist and can be removed. It also implies that
we have versioned profiles, rather that a profile with versioned data.

&gt;<i> 2) Would it be possible to include a forced migration, in case the first one
</I>&gt;<i> failed or generally didn't include everything?
</I>
This is a minor use case IMO and probably not worth complicating the
UI. However, by removing MonoDevelopProperties.xml from the target
profile, you can force a migration.

Something I didn't implement support for is for migrating the user
data of addins that are installed after MD is first run, but this
would be easily fixable by keeping a list of migrated addins in the
properties store and checking loaded addins against it.

It might be worth thinking about a GUI in preferences for deleting old
profiles and clearing caches.
