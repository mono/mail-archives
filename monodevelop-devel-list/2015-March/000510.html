<PRE>Hi Marius/All,

I am Udbhav Vats, 2nd year sophomore, currently pursuing my Bachelors
degree in Information Technology from IIIT Bangalore. I am comfortable in
working with following programming languages : Java, c++, c#, c and have
worked in python scripting language too. I have used GIT version control
before and have a sound understanding of source version control.

I feel that with the support of GIT and Subversion already in place,
Mercurial is an important and widely used version control tool and an Addin
support for it will prove to be very valuable for MonoDevelop.

To begin with, I am trying to setup/build MonoDevelop from GitHub on my
windows machine and following the steps mentioned in the wiki
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.monodevelop.com/developers/building-monodevelop/">http://www.monodevelop.com/developers/building-monodevelop/</A>&gt;. I will
create the simple date command Addin, following the Addin creation article
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.monodevelop.com/developers/articles/creating-a-simple-add-in/">http://www.monodevelop.com/developers/articles/creating-a-simple-add-in/</A>&gt; to
get a basic overview of how addins are created for MonoDevelop. I am also
taking a look at the source code at github (
<A HREF="https://github.com/mono/monodevelop/tree/master/main/src/addins/VersionControl">https://github.com/mono/monodevelop/tree/master/main/src/addins/VersionControl</A>)
for GIT and Subversion support to get an idea of how those addins were
implemented.

I will start taking a look at Mercurial APIs and see how we can integrate
it with MonoDevelop.
For creating a strong proposal and a clear and detailed timeline, I would
appreciate guidance from MonoDevelop community and Marius. Kindly let me
know the right approach that I should take or if there is anything that I
should get myself acquainted with.

Regards,
Udbhav
