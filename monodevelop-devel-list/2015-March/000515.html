<PRE>Hello again,

Maybe my previous mail was a little too wide/open. I've been thinking a little more about the project idea (MD Class Diagrams) and what exactly was being asked for. The project describes that the addin should generate class diagrams, but to what extend? Would gtk# be involved to interact with a generated class diagram - say the classes were placed illogically or the arrows needed to be moved/removed. Or would we draw the class diagram(s) onto a Bitmap? 

As for actually generating the classes, their attributes and their relations, how'd we determine which namespace (or entire solution?) we should generate a diagram(s) for. Should we call the addin from the command line, gtk# interface or maybe it's possible to add another option to the contextual menu when right clicking a solution?

Lastly, I'm assuming reflection is the way to go and that we'd be working on source files (.cs). In any which case I assume the Assembly class could be used?
&gt;<i>From .cs files <A HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.assembly.getexecutingassembly%28v=vs.110%29.aspxFrom">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.assembly.getexecutingassembly%28v=vs.110%29.aspxFrom</A> .dll files <A HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1009fa28(v=vs.110">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1009fa28(v=vs.110</A>).aspx
</I>So that's a lot of questions and a few assumptions. Hope to hear back from you!
Regards,Simon Larsen

Hello,
I am Simon Larsen, currently I am studying Software Engineering (B.Sc) at the Southern University Denmark. I hope to participate in this years GSoC program and have found the Mono project to be very interesting. I've used both the Monodevelop IDE and the Mono runtime to build applications through Unity3d and Xamarin Studio and would love to contribute to this development environment. 
I've looked through the GSoC project ideas list and I'm interested in working with the Monodevelop IDE. Particularly I'm interested in working on the &quot;MD Class Diagrams&quot; project as this is very relevant to my current semester (UP and UML) and I've always been a fan of code generation. 
I'm new to the whole GSoC process, so I'm not entirely sure how to proceed from here? Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you.
Regards,Simon Larsen
