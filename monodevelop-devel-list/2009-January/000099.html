<PRE>El jue, 08-01-2009 a las 02:34 -0500, Michael Hutchinson escribi&#243;:
&gt;<i> I recently implemented &quot;Go to definition&quot; and &quot;Find references&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> commands as top-level items in the text editor context menu. This
</I>&gt;<i> allows them to be bound to keyboard shortcuts, F12 and Shift-F12.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I haven't committed them yet as I have a few concerns about
</I>&gt;<i> how it relates to the existing refactoring/navigation context menus.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, MD dynamically generates submenus for the symbol under the
</I>&gt;<i> cursor, and its enclosing/parent items, i.e. the enclosing member, the
</I>&gt;<i> enclosing class, and (if it's a variable) the type. Each of these
</I>&gt;<i> menus allows refactoring and navigation operations on the associated
</I>&gt;<i> item.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are a few problems with this. Since the submenus are dynamically
</I>&gt;<i> generated, user extensions cannot add new refactoring operations to
</I>&gt;<i> the menu, nor can extensions override the handling of these commands.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, the commands cannot be keybound -- and even if they could, it
</I>&gt;<i> would not be obvious which commands the shortcuts would apply to,
</I>&gt;<i> since the menus contain identical commands.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, my question is: are all of the submenus really necessary? How
</I>&gt;<i> useful is it to be able to implement members on a class from the
</I>&gt;<i> context menu on a field within it? What I'd like to do is replace all
</I>&gt;<i> these menus with a simple refactor/navigate menu that would apply only
</I>&gt;<i> to the item under the cursor, as this would be keybindable and
</I>&gt;<i> extensible. However, would it be noticeably less usable or functional?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I think we should check how those refactoring commands are presented in
other IDEs and tools. In any case, I don't think the submenus add much
value. The editor context menu could have a &quot;Go to declaration&quot; command
at the top, maybe a &quot;Go to declaring type&quot; (for type members), and a
&quot;Refactoring&quot; menu with all other refactoring commands.

Lluis.
