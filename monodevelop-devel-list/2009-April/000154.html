</I>&gt;<i> Hey, that's a very cool article and addin!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Thanks a lot, i have a few other already implemented for extracting method
etc. i will try to make them patch ready (translation of UI and a few other
things) and submit them.



&gt;<i> Not much has happened in that area, unfortunately, apart from a few
</I>&gt;<i> stubs in MonoDevelop.Projects.Dom.Refactoring.
</I>

Okay, I will check it out to see if it reveals intentions for the future, if
not i might ask here or come with a suggestion for a structure.


&gt;<i> Interestingly, refactoring seems to be the most popular area for
</I>&gt;<i> contributing to MD 2.0. There's one other refactoring addin I'm aware
</I>&gt;<i> of (<A HREF="http://twitter.com/agileguy/statuses/1607907629">http://twitter.com/agileguy/statuses/1607907629</A>), and lengthy
</I>&gt;<i> planning/discussions about a resharper-like addin, so it seems to me
</I>&gt;<i> that it would be good to get some of the core infrastructure done
</I>&gt;<i> soon.
</I>

The reason im interreseted in refactorings is that it on my end is the one
thing i miss before i can use MonoDevelop effectively in my daily work. I do
TDD/BDD and really have getting used to refactoring tools generating most of
the basic code constructs for me while i run my tests, and it is pretty
killing for my productivity to not have these.

But when they are in place i might find a new aray i thing needs improvement
for instance integration with specification framework etc. I think most
people have it this way, they wan't to help out but prefer to do it on
features they miss themselves :-)
