&gt;<i> Just for the fun of it i have implemented a few refactorings in monodevelop
</I>&gt;<i> last weekend (I have blogged about the implementation of one of the
</I>&gt;<i> simplest:

Hey, that's a very cool article and addin!

We should have a place on the MonoDvelop website to link to things like this.

&gt;<i> ). Today i fired up this list and found a discussion from november about
</I>&gt;<i> Mike Kr&#252;ger starting to refactor the refactorings:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What are progress on this, i don't see anything in trunk or in any branches
</I>&gt;<i> i could think of (mkrueger and monodevelop)?
</I>
Not much has happened in that area, unfortunately, apart from a few
stubs in MonoDevelop.Projects.Dom.Refactoring.

We (the core MD team) was working on stabilising MonoDevelop 2.0 until
mid-March, and since then we've been busy on other areas of MD, in
particular the Mac and Windows ports.

Interestingly, refactoring seems to be the most popular area for
contributing to MD 2.0. There's one other refactoring addin I'm aware
of (<A HREF="http://twitter.com/agileguy/statuses/1607907629">http://twitter.com/agileguy/statuses/1607907629</A>), and lengthy
planning/discussions about a resharper-like addin, so it seems to me
that it would be good to get some of the core infrastructure done
soon.

&gt;<i> And another question: The TODO list on
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://monodevelop.com/Developers/TODO">http://monodevelop.com/Developers/TODO</A> seems out of date, if we take the
</I>&gt;<i> refactoring for example rename and encapsulate field are already
</I>&gt;<i> implemented. Who maintains this list?
</I>
That list hasn't had a maintainer for a while, unfortunately. It's at
least 18 months out of date (both those features were in MD 1.0).

&gt;<i> And is it correct that this is the development list, there seems to be a lot
</I>&gt;<i> of development related questions on the monodevelop-list as well?
</I>
Yes, this is the correct list for discussion about developing addins
and MD itself :)
