<PRE>First and foremost, I'd like to see all the legacy code that is somewhat 
broken or need work to be useful to be moved somewhere like &quot;attic&quot;.

I think making a list of common extension topics we can create a clear 
picture of what the API should look like.  It's pretty obvious where the 
pain points are when you try to follow a howto on adding a feature (even 
if a quick ad-hoc one).

I'd really like to be able to script a lot of my daily tasks in the IDE 
without writing an Addin (JavaScript or similar).  We could provide a 
small scripting environment with a simpler API that tries to cover the 
80% in a friendly way.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We should make monodevelop easier understandable&amp;  extendable.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think we should do some brain storming about stuff that we encounter
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> during our daily work with the source code. I begin with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> view/pad/workbench/language binding system.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * The way it's used it's not build for.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - For example the workspace window should wrap the gui the view content
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is displayed in (for example tab page or window) - therefore it should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be a DockItem directly. It should contain a collection of view contents
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (for example text editor/forms designer) - but stetic doesn't use this,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it does it's own. I don't know if the subviews are currently used.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I agree on that this code can be improved. There is some leftover
</I>&gt;<i> code from #D that we are not really using. Some functionality currently
</I>&gt;<i> implemented in MD.Ide could be directly handled by our docking system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - The Layout abstraction was for enabling other layout managers.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SharpDevelop had a floating layout (think of gimp layout) and a tabbed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> layout (called sdi) - later I got rid of the floating layout, because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> maintaining layouts is error prone. Now we don't need the abstraction
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anymore.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Workbench: We've IWorkbench, &#65279;&#65279;Workbench (not implementing IWorkbench
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or inheriting &#65279;DefaultWorkbench), &#65279;DefaultWorkbench (not inheriting from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Workbench). Easy to explain ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IWorkbench and DefaultWorkbench (the layout abstraction) are #D
</I>&gt;<i> leftovers. They are internal, so they are not relevant to add-in
</I>&gt;<i> developers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Workbench is the only public class.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Language bindings:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - They provide parsers/refactories - but no ambiences ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ambiences have their own extension points. Maybe we should do the same
</I>&gt;<i> for parsers and refactory providers? I don't know if it makes sense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We should review the api and see how language bindings are currently
</I>&gt;<i> used. So for example, if we move the comment tag properties to syntax
</I>&gt;<i> modes, and parser/refactorer have their own extension points, there
</I>&gt;<i> isn't much left in ILanguageBinding. This code has evolved a lot since
</I>&gt;<i> it was designed, so maybe it can go away or it can be replaced by
</I>&gt;<i> something else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - They provide comment tags, but we get comment tags from the syntax
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we should get rid of those comment tag properties from
</I>&gt;<i> ILanguageBinding, and use only the info from syntax modes. However, they
</I>&gt;<i> are still being used when creating a new file to insert the license
</I>&gt;<i> header. We have to find a way of querying information from syntax modes
</I>&gt;<i> without having and instance of an editor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - They bind to a 'language' and can ask if a file is a source code file
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ore not - they're not using our newer mime type system (inconsistent!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The mime-type system doesn't have information about which types are
</I>&gt;<i> source code files. We have per-mime-type formatting policies, but this
</I>&gt;<i> is unrelated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Maybe they should be attached to a ProjectDom or ViewContent to allow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easier access.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think that's necessary. You can already get a language binding
</I>&gt;<i> from Project, and you can get a project from ProjectDom and ViewContent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When 2.2 is released we should put some effort on building a better
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> framework people can work with. I would like that everybody looks out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for possible code issues. At first not finding solutions, only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> collecting possible issues. When we've time and collected enough we can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> go over to design work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our resources are limited, so we have to be careful about where we put
</I>&gt;<i> our development effort. We should focus on fixing, improving or
</I>&gt;<i> implementing features that users really need. Improving the API is part
</I>&gt;<i> of the work, but we have to find the right effort/benefit balance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lluis.
