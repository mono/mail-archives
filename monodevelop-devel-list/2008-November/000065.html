<PRE>Hi

&gt;<i> * Cross-project/language aspects of refactoring. For example, if an
</I>&gt;<i> identifier is renamed in a C# project, it may need to be renamed in a
</I>&gt;<i> dependent VB project or in ASP.NET or XAML files. Unit testing of
</I>&gt;<i> these will be an interesting challenge...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Simple solution: If the project has no parser for all files in a project
either warn the user or don't allow it. Currently we destroy code -
that's not a good solution. Btw. for this I wan't previews - then the
developer can have a clear picture on what's going on with the source
code.

&gt;<i> * Extensibility -- how easy will it be to build more &quot;complex&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> refactorings? It would be interesting to catalogue all the
</I>&gt;<i> refactorings provided by popular IDEs and Addins (VS, Eclipse,
</I>&gt;<i> Resharper, DevExpress Refactor Pro etc) and try to break them up into
</I>&gt;<i> more primitive operations, so that languages can get the high-level
</I>&gt;<i> operations for free by implementing only the low-level operations. I
</I>&gt;<i> know we have something like this already, but I think it'd be good to
</I>&gt;<i> re-evaluate the primitives in light of all of the high-level
</I>&gt;<i> operations we might want to implement.
</I>
Just get a copy of &quot;Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code&quot;
from Martin Fowler :). I'm still sleeping with it under my pillow.

&gt;<i> * Indexing -- for renaming operations (and &quot;find all references&quot;) our
</I>&gt;<i> performance is currently dire. It might be worth having an index to
</I>&gt;<i> make these faster.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Yes the performance is worse, but currently it's mostly because of
something I would call &quot;issue with the infrastructure&quot; - we can do  it
much more faster. But currently I don't want extensive changes here.

&gt;<i> I don't have any ideas right now on how these should be done, but I
</I>&gt;<i> think it's important to take them into consideration  :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I'm pretty sure I would've missed Cross project/language aspects :-).


Regards
Mike
