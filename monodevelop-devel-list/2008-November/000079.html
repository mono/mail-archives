There's potentially a larger issue, in that the MD makefiles are
synchronized by MD itself, so the functionality which does this sync
apparently does not currently support robust dependency checking for its
output.  Regardless of whether the MD project wants to have robust
dependency checking for project references, I suspect many of our users
will want it.

&gt;<i> &gt; So I'd like to know what you think about this. I suggested making this

</I>
If the feature is optional, I think it should probably be on by default,
because most people will expect a change in a project to rebuild
projects which depend on it.
