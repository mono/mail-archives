No, that's unrelated. &#65279;Makefile synchronization just keeps in sync lists
of files and references, but it does not decide what to do with those.
That's up to the makefile. 

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; So I'd like to know what you think about this. I suggested making this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; project dependency optional, although I don't know how hard it would be.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't think it's necessary. Maybe we could make it more convenient
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by having make targets corresponding to the core areas e.g. make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; md-project-gui would execute make in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; main/src/core/MonoDevelop.Project.Gui.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the feature is optional, I think it should probably be on by default,
</I>&gt;<i> because most people will expect a change in a project to rebuild
</I>&gt;<i> projects which depend on it.
</I>
That's ok to me, go ahead.

Lluis.
