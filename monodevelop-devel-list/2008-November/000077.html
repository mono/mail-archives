<PRE>Hi!

I've discussed with Mike (Kestner) a couple of times about the need for
proper dependency checks between the MD makefiles. That is, a change in
one of the MD projects would cause all dependent projects to be
rebuilt. 

I'm reluctant to do this change because any small change (even if not
breaking change) in one of the core MD assemblies would cause the
rebuild of all the 50 assemblies of MD, and that would be really
annoying for those who work daily on those assemblies.

However Mike is right in that with proper dependency checking the
makefiles would be more correct and would avoid weird build errors when
there are changes in the api.

So I'd like to know what you think about this. I suggested making this
project dependency optional, although I don't know how hard it would be.

Thoughts?
Lluis.
