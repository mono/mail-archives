<PRE>+1. Test-driven design is the way to go with such a complex subsystem.

I foresee some hard spots:
1) UI-decoupling on preview/user-decision
2) Memory-consumption to keep track of all pending changes, and before/after
scenarios
3) Undoability

Also it should be decided if all would be affected files should be loaded in
editor windows, or changes could occur behind-the-scener after user
previewing/deciding, this may bring in some synchronization issues with
other subsystems/addins like the version control one.

About version control integration, it is not common on open source projects,
but where I work currently SVN is configured to demand locking files to be
able to commit changes on them, meaning that eclipse/vs.net keep asking me
if I want to overwrite the locally marked-as-readonly files in the middle of
refactorings, as I never try to guess and lock files prior to working on
them, and I think we should support that too.

Just some thoughts
