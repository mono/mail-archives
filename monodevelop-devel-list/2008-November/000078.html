Actually, a full build is surprisingly fast these days. Also, you can
work around this problem by cd'ing into the directory of the changed
addin before issuing the &quot;make&quot; command.

&gt;<i> However Mike is right in that with proper dependency checking the

I think this would be a really good idea, as we've had a number of
breakages resulting from the lack of proper dependencies. I've
actually added dependencies to a couple of addins already.

&gt;<i> So I'd like to know what you think about this. I suggested making this
</I>&gt;<i> project dependency optional, although I don't know how hard it would be.
</I>
I don't think it's necessary. Maybe we could make it more convenient
by having make targets corresponding to the core areas e.g. make
md-project-gui would execute make in
main/src/core/MonoDevelop.Project.Gui.
