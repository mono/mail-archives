The GTK# addin isn't included in the Mac builds, because drag-n-drop
issues in the Mac GTK prevent our GTK# designer from working on Mac.
Unfortunately the GTK# templates are in the same addin as the
designer. However, handwritten GTK# code should still work -- MD
itself uses GTK#.

BTW, monodevelop-devel-list is for discussing the code/development of
MonoDevelop. For other discussions, including bugs and support, please
use monodevelop-list.
