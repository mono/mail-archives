<PRE>Hi

&gt;<i> 1) UI-decoupling on preview/user-decision
</I>
Modal dialog for refactorings ?

&gt;<i> 2) Memory-consumption to keep track of all pending changes, and
</I>&gt;<i> before/after scenarios
</I>
If we only keep the deltas I don't see a problem. When we keep the parse
tree of the whole solution we may have one. (At least we would waste
some memory)

&gt;<i> 3) Undoability
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Ok. This one is really hard especially the undo handling is not done ide
wide instead it's coupled with the views to handle undo/redo. We may
need to change if we want undoable refactorings.

&gt;<i> Also it should be decided if all would be affected files should be
</I>&gt;<i> loaded in editor windows, or changes could occur behind-the-scener
</I>&gt;<i> after user previewing/deciding, this may bring in some synchronization
</I>&gt;<i> issues with other subsystems/addins like the version control one.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>No I don't want editor windows there. I want a refactoring dialog that
shows the refactorings in an understandable way - but I wan't to use an
&quot;editor window&quot; to show the refactoring changes.

&gt;<i> About version control integration, it is not common on open source
</I>&gt;<i> projects, but where I work currently SVN is configured to demand
</I>&gt;<i> locking files to be able to commit changes on them, meaning that
</I>&gt;<i> eclipse/vs.net keep asking me if I want to overwrite the locally
</I>&gt;<i> marked-as-readonly files in the middle of refactorings, as I never try
</I>&gt;<i> to guess and lock files prior to working on them, and I think we
</I>&gt;<i> should support that too.
</I>
That's a good feature. I noted it.

Thanks
Mike
