I think it's useful to have stronger &quot;typing&quot; for strings, and changes
like this would be better to make sooner rather than later. The struct
could also store whether it's a relative path, and have utility
methods (Combine, GetRoot, GetExtension, etc).

I was thinking about a similar &quot;typing&quot; trick for solution
configurations vs. project configurations, since I'm pretty sure
they're used interchangeably in many places when they shouldn't be.
