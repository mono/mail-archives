<PRE>&gt;<i> When setting a breakpoint in MonoDevelop on my C# code, my
</I>&gt;<i> mono-embedding-application crashes (with MonoDevelop in Debug mode and
</I>&gt;<i> showing the breakpoint as &quot;active&quot;). Activating my self-built mono-2.0.dll
</I>&gt;<i> and debugging into the native application shows that the mono runtime seems
</I>&gt;<i> to crash in mini.c in the function mono_jit_runtime_invoke when calling
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;return runtime_invoke(obj, params, exc, info-&gt;compiled_method);&quot;. This is
</I>&gt;<i> called when my embedding application's C++ code invokes a method on some
</I>&gt;<i> object. From that the above line is called about 27 times before the crash
</I>&gt;<i> occurs on that line on the 28th pass-by.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When deactivating the breakpoint in MonoDevelop no crash occurs - I can then
</I>&gt;<i> set and remove breakpoints in MonoDevelop in debug mode and the breakpoints
</I>&gt;<i> appear as active. But hitting a breakpoint will crash. This happens with my
</I>&gt;<i> self-built mono-2.0.dll as well as with the one shipped with the 2.10 mono
</I>&gt;<i> distribution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems as if the code injected by a breakpoint has some defect. Any idea
</I>&gt;<i> what to try next? Is this due to beta status of Mono 2.10 or MonoDevelop
</I>&gt;<i> 2.6?
</I>
Sdb uses segmentation faults to trigger breakpoints, so a native
debugger will detect them as crashes when they're triggered.
Is your app actually crashing when the (VS) debugger isn't attached?
Also, breakpoints will actually cause (unhandled) crashes on 64bit
windows prior to win7sp1, I don't know what version of vista, and all
known versions of xp. ( <A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976038">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976038</A> )
