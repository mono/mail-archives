<PRE>&gt;<i> Sdb uses segmentation faults to trigger breakpoints, so a native debugger

Thx for your quick reply. I am running on win7sp1 64 bit. Yes, my app also
crashes with the VS debugger not attached, with both, my self-built version
of mono-2.0.dll as well as the one shipped with Mono 2.10. Well, it's not
quite a crash - it's rather some application message box saying that there
was some severe error and the app is going to close now. Maybe there's some
segmentation fault exception handler built into the native app? How do I get
the soft debugger exception handler (don't know if that's the correct
terminology) to handle the breakpoint exception first?

I'll probably try to recreate the situation with a simple console C++
application to see if there's a difference to the application I'm currently
using.

Thanks again

</PRE>
