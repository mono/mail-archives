<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> (2.6) and not by Visual Studio. Am I wrong thinking they actually ARE 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> built by Mono?

</I>&gt;<i>On windows, MonoDevelop runs on (and builds with) .net by default.
</I>
Allright, that explains things. Thank you. Now I managed to build my mdbs
with pdb2mdb as well as setting the .Net runtime to default to Mono-2.10.2
in MonoDevelop's preferences. Both ways result in an mdb file changing the
behavior in the same way:

When setting a breakpoint in MonoDevelop on my C# code, my
mono-embedding-application crashes (with MonoDevelop in Debug mode and
showing the breakpoint as &quot;active&quot;). Activating my self-built mono-2.0.dll
and debugging into the native application shows that the mono runtime seems
to crash in mini.c in the function mono_jit_runtime_invoke when calling
&quot;return runtime_invoke(obj, params, exc, info-&gt;compiled_method);&quot;. This is
called when my embedding application's C++ code invokes a method on some
object. From that the above line is called about 27 times before the crash
occurs on that line on the 28th pass-by.
 
When deactivating the breakpoint in MonoDevelop no crash occurs - I can then
set and remove breakpoints in MonoDevelop in debug mode and the breakpoints
appear as active. But hitting a breakpoint will crash. This happens with my
self-built mono-2.0.dll as well as with the one shipped with the 2.10 mono
distribution.

It seems as if the code injected by a breakpoint has some defect. Any idea
what to try next? Is this due to beta status of Mono 2.10 or MonoDevelop
2.6?

Thanks for further advice.

</PRE>
