&gt;<i> Hello:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been developing C#.NET applications for sometime now and have been in
</I>&gt;<i> the business of developing business applications some 20+ years.  About 5
</I>&gt;<i> months ago i became interested in iPhone development when i happened upon
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop.  I found a book on Books24x7.com which i've worked through and
</I>&gt;<i> have an iPhone app underway which i feel pretty good about.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That said, I've been finding that the more i dive into this development
</I>&gt;<i> environment the fewer comprehensive references and development support help
</I>&gt;<i> i find.  I'm starting to get into more advanced levels of development, but
</I>&gt;<i> keep running into &quot;walls&quot; as the learning curve steers me.  It seems to me
</I>&gt;<i> that learning Objective-C is an inevitable reality, and so I am working
</I>&gt;<i> through learning the language as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But the going is slow, and being accustomed to tons of .NET support and
</I>&gt;<i> stuff you can find on Google I'm becoming a bit frustrated with my progress.
</I>&gt;<i>  I'm kind of at a lost in deciding if I should stick with MonoDevelop or
</I>&gt;<i> switch over to Xcode and Objective-C and could use some good advice on which
</I>&gt;<i> direction I should go.  Also, can one build components in Xcode/Objective-C
</I>&gt;<i> and use them in MonoDevelop?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Further, I would welcome any information on MonoDevelop support, books,
</I>&gt;<i> tutorials, samples, forums, online chats, any other kind of MonoDevelop
</I>&gt;<i> and/or Xcode development resources, etc.  In particular I would like to
</I>&gt;<i> master the art of showing a view that my users can flip the pages with their
</I>&gt;<i> fingers, like when reading a book.  I've seen this kind of thing, but can
</I>&gt;<i> only find samples on how to do it in Xcode/Objective-C and would really
</I>&gt;<i> rather do it in MonoDevelop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Jim
