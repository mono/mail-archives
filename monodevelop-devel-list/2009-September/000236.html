&gt;<i> Hi
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why is it specific to .NET? I'm missing something here. The document
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; outline shows a hierarchy of items. It is so generic that it even works
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for XML documents. The class pad is also just a hierarchy of items (for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the whole project in this case). The goto type dialog shows a list of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; types in the solution. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The quick member navigation shows types in the first combo, and members
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the types in the second one. It can easily be redefined to showing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 'first level items of the file' in the first combo, and 'children of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; active first level item' in the second combo. Or something like that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't see anything .NET specific in all this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok I've looked a bit at the source code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Class pad:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ClassNodeBuilder, FieldNodeBuilder, MethodNodeBuilder,
</I>&gt;<i> NamespaceNodeBuilder etc. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But it can be extended using the addin tree - but the things we have are
</I>&gt;<i> very specific. For example: I've took a look at the MethodNodeBuilder -
</I>&gt;<i> it doesn't build child nodes (yes there are languages with methods in
</I>&gt;<i> methods). Taking this example it wouldn't even work if we had a new
</I>&gt;<i> INewMethod interface for such a language to be build with the class pad,
</I>&gt;<i> because the MethodNodeBuilder that takes care of building these objects
</I>&gt;<i> would prevent building child nodes.
</I>
I feel there is some misunderstanding here. If we introduce a new set of
INew* interfaces we'll certainly have to track the changes in
MethodNodeBuilder and all the builders. And those changes will include
rendering child nodes, since any node can have child nodes.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Quick Member navigation - it's not so easy to set the rules:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 'showing first level items of the file' means:
</I>&gt;<i> + Showing only the namespaces -&gt; no containing types (they're first
</I>&gt;<i> level, and will be part of the DOM as nodes)
</I>&gt;<i> + Don't show inner types (they're second level at best)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 'children of the active first level item' means:
</I>&gt;<i> + Show the current inner type (should be in the type selector).
</I>&gt;<i> + Show the current statement, if the DOM is extended and more specific
</I>&gt;<i> than the monodevelop DOM.
</I>
This has a very simple solution:

interface IQuickMemberNavigationProvider
{
	IEnumerable&lt;INode&gt; GetTypes ();
	IEnumerable&lt;INode&gt; GetMembers (INode type);
}

to be implemented by language bindings.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then there are 3 navigators: types/members/regions. That doesn't make
</I>&gt;<i> sense for some cases (think of C, there are no members/regions). 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Document outline:
</I>&gt;<i> The document outline that shows the hierarchy requires that
</I>&gt;<i> IOutlinedDocument is implemented. A XML and MD DOM get different
</I>&gt;<i> implementations of this interface. It's very general:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> public interface IOutlinedDocument
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i> 	Gtk.Widget GetOutlineWidget ();
</I>&gt;<i> 	void ReleaseOutlineWidget ();
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would say that's one of the best components we have for extensibility.
</I>&gt;<i> Because it doesn't 'lock' into a specific model. The downside is that it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't provide much to re-use. But I think we should have this sort of
</I>&gt;<i> extensibility for all components and let the non-.NET languages a way to
</I>&gt;<i> work around all pre defined structures and replace the components with
</I>&gt;<i> an own way. This ensures that we can't make a mistake.
</I>
But that's not always possible. For example, a solution may contain C#
and C++ projects, and the class pad has to show all of them in a single
tree.

It might work in other cases, for example in the quick member navigation
toolbar.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> btw. another thing: All pads/output function currently build on ambience
</I>&gt;<i> flags - but for other languages there may be different sets of flags
</I>&gt;<i> required for displaying the information at that point. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, that's currently possible (with some tweaks). But it means that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; language has to implement all the DOM interfaces: IField, IMethod,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IType, etc, which are full of .NET specific stuff. Yes, you can just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; throw NotSupportedException of all .NET specific methods and properties,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but that's just unnecessary bloat. If anything, it would be better to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We've classes that implement the interfaces, no .NET specific
</I>&gt;<i> implementation is required. But the other thing is that a new languages
</I>&gt;<i> now would ALWAYS require to implement all DOM interfaces that are full
</I>&gt;<i> of .NET specific stuff. (ok could use the same base class)
</I>&gt;<i> You've still not told how to display a VB output, Boo output and c#
</I>&gt;<i> output of a reflection source when putting the output code inside the
</I>&gt;<i> DOM objects. I think that's not easily possible.
</I>
I showed it some posts ago:

class DomField: IMember, INewField
{
        public string GetDescription (SomeContext ctx)
        {
                return ctx.Ambience.GetString (this, ctx.AmbienceOptions);
        }
        ...
}

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> MD side:
</I>&gt;<i> Code Completion DB -&gt; Data (in which DOM format)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Language binding:
</I>&gt;<i> Own Dom info + wants to display code completion data from the code
</I>&gt;<i> completion db 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That would work, although I don't see the benefit of separating data
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from display data in non .NET languages, since there will be a 1 to 1
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; correspondence between data and display data.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The benefit is that the non .NET languages can communicate with
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop components to produce output. And that the .NET unspecific
</I>&gt;<i> types/members etc. could be implemented today.
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes the output is altered (adding markup to names etc.) by
</I>&gt;<i> consuming code. Outputting the text from the DOM isn't very easy and
</I>&gt;<i> just a GetString () doesn't cut the edge. We've to display this
</I>&gt;<i> information in various tooltips/lists with different options (short name
</I>&gt;<i> vs. long name). Therefore the GetString () needs to get the same
</I>&gt;<i> parameters as ambiences.
</I>
I think we have to look at this case by case. For the tooltip case,
maybe this is enough:

interface ITooltipProvider
{
	string GetMarkup (INode node);
}

to be implemented in every non-.net language binding.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I tend to make the monodevelop DOM stuff .NET dependent in the type
</I>&gt;<i> model, generalize the object model so that other .NET languages can be
</I>&gt;<i> supported that are more far from C#/VB.NET and have a way to do
</I>&gt;<i> something like the IOutlinedDocument for each component. I don't want to
</I>&gt;<i> make the life harder for .NET language implementors when the non .NET
</I>&gt;<i> language implementors get little to no gain (See above - they need to
</I>&gt;<i> implement their own widgets/infrastructure - regardless of what we try,
</I>&gt;<i> more worse they can run into dead ends when trying to re-use the
</I>&gt;<i> monodevelop DOM - see the class output pad method example).
</I>
No, what I'm proposing does not involve implementing additional
widgets/infrastructure. See above.

Lluis.
