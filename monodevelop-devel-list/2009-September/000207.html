<PRE>Hi

&gt;<i> &gt; * The way it's used it's not build for.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - For example the workspace window should wrap the gui the view content
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is displayed in (for example tab page or window) - therefore it should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be a DockItem directly. It should contain a collection of view contents
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (for example text editor/forms designer) - but stetic doesn't use this,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it does it's own. I don't know if the subviews are currently used.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The ASP.NET designer uses a subview. There used to be an subview for
</I>&gt;<i> previews of HTML docs in MD.IDE, but AFAIK it was removed during
</I>&gt;<i> deGPLification.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
But no core addin should re-create the 'attached view content' subsystem
itself. And thats what stetic did. If the subsystem isn't good enough it
should be extended. 

&gt;<i> &gt; - The Layout abstraction was for enabling other layout managers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SharpDevelop had a floating layout (think of gimp layout) and a tabbed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; layout (called sdi) - later I got rid of the floating layout, because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maintaining layouts is error prone. Now we don't need the abstraction
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anymore.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, a floating layout would be useful for the Mac, if anyone cares
</I>&gt;<i> to implement it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
It's a nightmare to maintain. But if someone does it for mac - why not.

&gt;<i> * file/project templating system: I've really been stressing it,
</I>&gt;<i> particularly with ASP.NET / ASP.NET MVC templates, and it makes a lot
</I>&gt;<i> of things difficult.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * new file/project dialog: these have poor usability and organization.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Yes templates should be on the redo list.

&gt;<i> * code templates. I'd like to have APIs for addins to add code
</I>&gt;<i> templates.\
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I think it's easy to do this.

&gt;<i> * There are many places in the project system where a &quot;configuration&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> string is passed around and it's unclear whether it's a project
</I>&gt;<i> configuration (and should be looked up with GetConfiguration) or a
</I>&gt;<i> solution configuration (and the project configuration should be looked
</I>&gt;<i> up with GetActiveConfiguration).. This API really needs usability
</I>&gt;<i> improvements.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I had problems with this too :)

&gt;<i> It would also be very useful to improve the MD docs. I think there's a
</I>&gt;<i> good case to be made for using XML documentation -- see my previous
</I>&gt;<i> email on the topic.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
MD docs are a good thing. But I would prefer good APIs in the first
place.

Regards
Mike
