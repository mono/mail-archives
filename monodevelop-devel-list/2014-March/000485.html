&gt;<i> Hello. My name is Sergey. I am a student at Moscow Technological Institute

</I>&gt;<i> I am looking forward for GSoC 2014.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know that proposal should be made later at offical Google Summer of Code

</I>&gt;<i> mentoring organisation earlier.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was around Mono since I moved my development activities from Windows to
</I>&gt;<i> Linux. And I am happy that I haven't had to trade one of my favorite
</I>&gt;<i> programming languages for something else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I studied Mono's project list for GSoC, but I want to propose something
</I>&gt;<i> else. My target is MonoDevelop (Xamarin Studio), specifically an Xunit.net
</I>&gt;<i> test runner. I was planning an addin for MonoDevelop since the past autumn,
</I>&gt;<i> and I have studied for that purpose Mono.Addins, Xunit sources, NUnit addin
</I>&gt;<i> and, of course, basics of MonoDevelop's internals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At this moment my only opensource activity is this little project
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://github.com/x2bool/NCaptcha/wiki">https://github.com/x2bool/NCaptcha/wiki</A>). The project was written
</I>&gt;<i> ~2 years ago, and it's not the best code humanity has ever written. However,
</I>&gt;<i> the code does it's job.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My hope is to make the Xunit addin that will copy (at least most of the
</I>&gt;<i> parts) the functionality of the existing NUnit addin. I think it would be
</I>&gt;<i> wise to target the Xunit 2.0 (now in beta) release. The Xunit.net itself
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't seem to be the hardest part, but it will require some amount of
</I>&gt;<i> code. I see the hardest challenge in GUI integration because I am not
</I>&gt;<i> familiar with Gtk-Sharp. But if it's more or less like Java Swing or
</I>&gt;<i> Android's GUI framework this shouldn't be impossible.
</I>
Yeah, GTK# isn't difficult to pick up.

That said, I don't think much (if any) GUI work is necessary to
integrate XUnit - the sensible way to do this would be to plug in
XUnit as a test provider/runner into the existing unit test addin.
There would be some work to finish abstracting out the NUnit
dependency from the existing addin - maybe even modeling this
abstraction on the VS2012 unit test runner interfaces
(<A HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bhuvaneshwari/archive/2012/03/13/authoring-a-new-visual-studio-test-adapter.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bhuvaneshwari/archive/2012/03/13/authoring-a-new-visual-studio-test-adapter.aspx</A>)
to make it easier to port over OSS unit test adaptors from VS.

&gt;<i> As I understand my chances will increase if I will do some work to show my
</I>&gt;<i> skills. What should I do? Can I pick up a random bug from bugzilla, work on
</I>&gt;<i> it and make a pull request?
</I>
Yep. Preferably something you're interested in. And feel free to ask
questions if you're not sure how to approach the bug :)
