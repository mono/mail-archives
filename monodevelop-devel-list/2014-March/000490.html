<PRE>Hey,


I've written up a draft of my proposal about source code refactoring. However I know there's at least a couple of issues I wanted to raise:


<A HREF="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lXSLW4oEdFnTLlLVZXcJeeOBUdBU7yfO-N5My7nel_M/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lXSLW4oEdFnTLlLVZXcJeeOBUdBU7yfO-N5My7nel_M/edit?usp=sharing</A>


1) The timeframe. Since I've not really done a project of anywhere near this size, I can't really base it off previous work I've done. Equally the quality would need to be consistent (I'd like to think my previous projects have been of good quality, but there's definitely a few lapses when I've been rushing to get it to work - I wouldn't repeat those!). Whilst I don't want to underestimate how much time I'd give per action, I don't want to look like I'm achieveing very little per week. So would I need to assign more time to each? Or is it about right and I'd move my stretch goal (or some other stretch goal) into the main project?


2) I've identified the main points - but I'm sure that the list would grow both from further research and just small things I find from doing the bigger things. Is it fine to miss these out until after the application period?


3) Anything else that needs a touchup? Would I need to go into more detail as to how I'm going to implement X, Y, and Z - or is just saying 'I will do X and I need to make sure I consider this, this, and this'? The deliverables section seems a bit empty too.


Thanks again!


-Mark
