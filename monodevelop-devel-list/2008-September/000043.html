</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi everyone,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here are my current thoughts concerning per-project styles and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> policies, so that we can discuss it before I go ahead and implement
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it. I also have an number of questions that are interspersed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> throughout this email.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Rationale
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> =======
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are a number of settings and preferences in MD that should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> customisable for different solutions/projects. Basically, anything
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that affects the style of the code you write should be able to be set
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for a particular project, since different projects have different
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> styles and policies. I've lumped &quot;Styles and Policies&quot; together into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one heading since I believe they are related.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding styles, I want to stress that they are &quot;&#65279;anything that affects
</I>&gt;<i> the style of the code you write&quot;, which means that settings such as
</I>&gt;<i> indent mode (auto, smart) are not styles.
</I>
Exactly, I should have been clearer. Another example:
* the presence of the column ruler is a user preference
* the /width/ of the column ruler is a per-project setting

&gt;&gt;<i> Text Editor Settings
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ==============
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> These are the ones that most people care about -- per-mimetype
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> settings for the general text editor behaviour such as tabs-to-spaces,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> editor width, tab width, standard headers. Some languages may add to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this, e.g. C# indenter behaviour, and in future things like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> auto-formatting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indenter behavior and auto-formatting are not styles, and should not be
</I>&gt;<i> added to project preferences. On the other hand, formatting rules are
</I>&gt;<i> styles.
</I>
Yes, sorry for any ambiguity here. I meant the formatting behaviour of
the indenter/auto-formatter.

&gt;<i> About storing styles per-mimetype, I'm not sure this is needed. It makes
</I>&gt;<i> more sense to present styles to the user organized by file type, but at
</I>&gt;<i> a higher level than mime type. For example we could present settings for
</I>&gt;<i> C#, ASP.NET, XML. Those file types could be sub-divided in mime types if
</I>&gt;<i> we really need that level of detail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There should also be a &quot;default&quot; style, and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> per-mimetype settings should override this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Should we allow users to add custom mimetypes for their own file
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> formats, or just support the &quot;major&quot; text/code mimetypes registered in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MD?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we should allow binding mime types to file type categories
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. .addin files to XML category).
</I>
Well, that what VS does, kinda -- it lets you bind arbitrary file
extensions to editors, e.g. the C#, XML, XAML editors...

However, if we have a panel to do something like that, it's almost
trivial to allow each kind to have its own style.

&gt;&gt;<i> * Should we list only the mimetypes used in the project?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We should somehow filter out file types which don't make sense in a
</I>&gt;<i> given project. For example, ASP.NET styles should not be shown in a GTK#
</I>&gt;<i> project (although makes sense to show XML settings in all kind of
</I>&gt;<i> projects).
</I>
It won't be very easy. Since styles will mostly be edited at the
solution level, the solution's dialog is going to have to scan all
child projects for file types.

&gt;&gt;<i> * For each mimetype, should there be a checkbox to override the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;default&quot; text style? Or should there be a UI for adding/removing text
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> styles to the tree?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know how you plan to implement the GUI. IMO, style settings
</I>&gt;<i> could be implemented just like other project settings, using option
</I>&gt;<i> panels. By changing a setting you would be overriding it. There could be
</I>&gt;<i> a button for restoring default settings.
</I>
Unfortunately that doesn't make the settings cascade behaviour
obvious. I'd prefer to have the user explicitly override the parent
solution's settings.

&gt;&gt;<i> Policies
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ======
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are a number of other per-project settings that aren't quite
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> styles, but also aren't really build options or project properties.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm calling these &quot;policies&quot; for now. The only existing one is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changelog policies; in future, we could add settings such as &quot;pass
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tests before checkin&quot;, &quot;check style before checkin&quot;, &quot;must include
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changelog entry&quot;, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Settings Infrastructure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ================
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Many of these settings may need to be overridable for individual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> projects within a solution, because a solution's projects may have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been imported from elsewhere with different coding style. For this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reason, we need an infrastructure that can be used to get the setting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for a project, and if the setting has not been overridden, will grab
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the setting from the parent solution.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * How important is this feature?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think it is important.
</I>
You don't think it's important for project to be able to override
solution-level settings? I've spoken with a few people who disagree --
the main use case seems to have been importe

&gt;&gt;<i> * How many of the settings really need to be overridable at project level?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see why there should be a restriction on that.
</I>
Well, if there are settings that nobody ever wants to override, then
making them overridable will add unnecessary UI.

&gt;&gt;<i> * Should settings be overridable at &quot;solution folder&quot; level too, hence
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> allowing a cascade of settings?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We could do it (although it is not so important).
</I>
Yes, I don't think it so important, though it's probably not hard. So,
is it worth the effort (and UI clutter)?

&gt;&gt;<i> * Should settings or group of settings be individually overridable? Or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should it just allow a project to override *all* settings? Does this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really need any granularity?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Allow overriding at file type level is probably enough.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Where should settings be stored? The solution file and the project
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> files? I feel this is better than a .userprefs-like file, since it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> makes sure the settings stay with the project/solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It has to be stored in the project file, since the idea is to share all
</I>&gt;<i> those settings with all developers, and that would not be possible if
</I>&gt;<i> you store it in userprefs.
</I>
The actual .userprefs files is right out, of course, since it should
never be shared. I meant some kind of userprefs-like file, e.g.
solutionname.style, to avoid cluttering the build files. However,
having it in the project file so that it's impossible NOT to share it
:<i>-)
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> * Should setting be duplicated in the project in case it's opened
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without the solution? Or should the project have a flag to say that it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expects settings to be stored in a solution, so MD can warn when the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solution isn't present?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since this is an uncommon case, I would just use the default settings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * What settings do we default to when opening projects that don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contain settings Do we automatically add default settings to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solution files? Or fall back to a set of user preferences?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All style and policy settings should be available as user preferences.
</I>&gt;<i> Those would be the settings to use when creating a new solution.
</I>
Well, yes, that's a given; the user must be able to have a default
style for new projects. The question is whether we should write the
settings to the files automatically in the case where there are none
-- all MD-created projects should have style settings baked in upon
creation, but files from other sources would not.

It would also be nice to have a &quot;smart default&quot; mode that would infer
some settings (tabs/spaces) from the files.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> GUI Infrastructure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> =============
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's difficult to present all of these options in the GUI in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scalable way, particularly the per-mimetype editor settings
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Should the settings be in the main &quot;Project options&quot; dialog or a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> separate &quot;Styles and policies&quot; dialog? The separate dialog has the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> advantage that the same dialog can be used to edit the user's named
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> styles and default style. It would also help to not overload the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> setting treeview in the existing project options dialog.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think they should go in the project options dialog. We can have a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Coding Style&quot; category and add a subcategory for each file type.
</I>
Don't forget that each file type will have sub-options, so the tree
will be at least three deep.

I would like the main panel for the &quot;Coding Style&quot; category to be used
to add / override / load / save file types, and dynamically insert the
corresponding subcategories into the tree.

I'm still not sure how this would work for allowing the user to manage
styles outside of projects.

&gt;&gt;<i> * Should each panel have &quot;use parent solution's style&quot;, &quot;load/save
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> named style&quot; etc options? Or should these apply to all styles?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Load/save can be done at project level. Overriding at file type level.
</I>
So it won't be possible to save just (e.g.) a C# style; you'd have to
save everything?

&gt;&gt;<i> * VS has a setting panel that can be used to add &quot;file types&quot; and set
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the editing experience that's used for them. maybe we could do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something similar with per-mimetype styles -- the top-level panel for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> editor setting would contain this list, and adding a file type would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cause it and its options to appear in the tree. Files not handled this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way would fall back to the &quot;Other files&quot; style (VS has an &quot;All files&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> option which aggregates the common settings from all files, with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tri-state checkboxes etc, but I feel this is overcomplex).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In general, editing experience settings are not styles, they are about
</I>&gt;<i> editor behavior. However it makes sense to allow binding a mime type to
</I>&gt;<i> a known file type for which behavior and style settings can be set.
</I>
Yes, I meant use a similar UI but for styles, not editor experiences.

&gt;&gt;<i> Named Styles
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ==========
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It should be possible to save a project's style, and apply this style
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to other solutions/projects. However, I don't think it's viable or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> desirable to synchronise these in any way. Once a project is created,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> its settings should remain constant unless they are explicitly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I also have a number of mockups on my whiteboard which aren't so easy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to express in email :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cool, feel free to post.
</I>
It'll probably be better when I have some actual stetic mockups or code.
