See &quot;named styles&quot; :)

&gt;&gt;<i> Settings Infrastructure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ================
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Many of these settings may need to be overridable for individual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> projects within a solution, because a solution's projects may have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been imported from elsewhere with different coding style. For this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reason, we need an infrastructure that can be used to get the setting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for a project, and if the setting has not been overridden, will grab
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the setting from the parent solution.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * How important is this feature?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IMO it's as important to have per-project settings as it is to have
</I>&gt;<i> per-solution settings.
</I>&gt;<i> As an example, I have a solution with some C# projects and a C
</I>&gt;<i> project. For external reasons, the coding standard for the C project
</I>&gt;<i> is different than for the C# project. I suspect that, as MD becomes
</I>&gt;<i> more mature and well-known as a solid, general-purpose IDE, there will
</I>&gt;<i> be more and more mixed-language solutions that will lend themselves to
</I>&gt;<i> different styles per project.
</I>
Mixed-language solutions does NOT mean you need to override things at
the project level. I think the only real case for project-level
overriding is when different project use the same language but
different styles.

&gt;&gt;<i> * How many of the settings really need to be overridable at project level?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All of the ones that are overridable at the solution level.
</I>
Including things like commit policies?

My question was really meant as, should we make everything
overridable, or evaluate it on a per-case basis? Allowing the user to
override things adds UI, which just clutters things when it's not
necessary.

&gt;&gt;<i> * Where should settings be stored? The solution file and the project
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> files? I feel this is better than a .userprefs-like file, since it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> makes sure the settings stay with the project/solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there some way to do this such that the settings will be ignored
</I>&gt;<i> and won't be stripped if the project/solution is opened in another
</I>&gt;<i> IDE?
</I>
We can write settings into MSBuild files so that VS won't touch them.

&gt;&gt;<i> * Should setting be duplicated in the project in case it's opened
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without the solution? Or should the project have a flag to say that it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expects settings to be stored in a solution, so MD can warn when the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solution isn't present?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would think it makes sense to store the settings at the tree level
</I>&gt;<i> at which they're set. (Solutionwide =&gt; solution settings,
</I>&gt;<i> Project-specific=&gt; project settings)
</I>
In terms of storage, that makes perfect sense. The potential problem
is when a project is opened independently of the solution.

&gt;&gt;<i> It should be possible to save a project's style, and apply this style
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to other solutions/projects. However, I don't think it's viable or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> desirable to synchronise these in any way. Once a project is created,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> its settings should remain constant unless they are explicitly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed.
