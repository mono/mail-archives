<PRE>&gt;<i> * Should we allow users to add custom mimetypes for their own file
</I>&gt;<i> formats, or just support the &quot;major&quot; text/code mimetypes registered in
</I>&gt;<i> MD?
</I>&gt;<i> * Should we list only the mimetypes used in the project?
</I>
If the answer to the latter is yes, then the answer to the former
should also be yes.

&gt;<i> * For each mimetype, should there be a checkbox to override the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;default&quot; text style? Or should there be a UI for adding/removing text
</I>&gt;<i> styles to the tree?
</I>
Probably it would be a good idea to have a store of different styles
created by the user.

&gt;<i> Settings Infrastructure
</I>&gt;<i> ================
</I>&gt;<i> Many of these settings may need to be overridable for individual
</I>&gt;<i> projects within a solution, because a solution's projects may have
</I>&gt;<i> been imported from elsewhere with different coding style. For this
</I>&gt;<i> reason, we need an infrastructure that can be used to get the setting
</I>&gt;<i> for a project, and if the setting has not been overridden, will grab
</I>&gt;<i> the setting from the parent solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * How important is this feature?
</I>
IMO it's as important to have per-project settings as it is to have
per-solution settings.
As an example, I have a solution with some C# projects and a C
project. For external reasons, the coding standard for the C project
is different than for the C# project. I suspect that, as MD becomes
more mature and well-known as a solid, general-purpose IDE, there will
be more and more mixed-language solutions that will lend themselves to
different styles per project.

&gt;<i> * How many of the settings really need to be overridable at project level?
</I>
All of the ones that are overridable at the solution level.

&gt;<i> * Where should settings be stored? The solution file and the project
</I>&gt;<i> files? I feel this is better than a .userprefs-like file, since it
</I>&gt;<i> makes sure the settings stay with the project/solution.
</I>
Is there some way to do this such that the settings will be ignored
and won't be stripped if the project/solution is opened in another
IDE?

&gt;<i> * Should setting be duplicated in the project in case it's opened
</I>&gt;<i> without the solution? Or should the project have a flag to say that it
</I>&gt;<i> expects settings to be stored in a solution, so MD can warn when the
</I>&gt;<i> solution isn't present?
</I>
I would think it makes sense to store the settings at the tree level
at which they're set. (Solutionwide =&gt; solution settings,
Project-specific=&gt; project settings)

&gt;<i> It should be possible to save a project's style, and apply this style
</I>&gt;<i> to other solutions/projects. However, I don't think it's viable or
</I>&gt;<i> desirable to synchronise these in any way. Once a project is created,
</I>&gt;<i> its settings should remain constant unless they are explicitly
</I>&gt;<i> changed.
</I>
Agreed.
