Nice!

&gt;<i> However, I'm having more troubles on Windows/.NET (I'm testing it on a
</I>&gt;<i> clean Windows 7 machine with Gtk# and MonoDevelop installed using the
</I>&gt;<i> instructions from the web). When I go through the addin installation
</I>&gt;<i> procedure, it installs the adding and just before showing the final
</I>&gt;<i> dialog window (with success message and warnings), it shows an
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Unhandled Exception.&quot; dialog with the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I tried attaching to the process from VS debugger and it doesn't seem
</I>&gt;<i> to even load my &quot;FSharpBinding.dll&quot; assembly, so I'm wondering if this
</I>&gt;<i> could some issue in MonoDevelop itself? I tried creating a trivial
</I>&gt;<i> language binding in C# and that worked okay, but I was able to
</I>&gt;<i> reproduce the error with the repository above on two different
</I>&gt;<i> machines. I can also send you the generated log file from the
</I>&gt;<i> installation if you need more information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wasn't quite able to figure out what is going on (I think the
</I>&gt;<i> exception actually comes from Mono.Addins and I think I've seen errors
</I>&gt;<i> like this when accidentally accessing GUI stuff from a background

</I>&gt;<i> this will be probably quite easy to find out for somebody who has

</I>
Lluis will need to look at that; it sounds like an issue in
Mono.Addins. I've cc'd him.

&gt;<i> Thanks for your help!
</I>&gt;<i> Tomas Petricek
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS: I think that the Visual Studio projects in monodevelop-2.4 &quot;tag&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> (I used that version to make sure my adding works with latest stable
</I>&gt;<i> version) incorrectly reference 4.0.0 versions of Mono.Addins etc. (see
</I>&gt;<i> for example <A HREF="http://github.com/mono/monodevelop/blob/monodevelop-2.4/main/src/core/MonoDevelop.Ide/MonoDevelop.Ide.csproj">http://github.com/mono/monodevelop/blob/monodevelop-2.4/main/src/core/MonoDevelop.Ide/MonoDevelop.Ide.csproj</A>).
</I>&gt;<i> I tried changed that to 5.0.0 on my machine, but it didn't resolve the
</I>&gt;<i> issue I was having.
</I>
There should be a GAC policy to make Mono.Addins 0.5 used for 0.4
references, so it shouldn't be an issue.

BTW, we have a public addin build server at
<A HREF="http://addins.monodevelop.com/">http://addins.monodevelop.com/</A> that can build and publish open-source
addins against specific MonoDevelop versions...

&gt;<i> PS2: I noticed there was a project with the aim to implement F#
</I>&gt;<i> support for MonoDevelop at the GSOC this year, but I couldn't find any
</I>&gt;<i> outcomes of the project. Is that available somewhere? I tried
</I>&gt;<i> contacting the person who worked on that, but with no luck (possibly,
</I>&gt;<i> I just got a wrong email). Anyway, I could probably contribute my work
</I>&gt;<i> to that project (or the other way round) to avoid duplication of
</I>&gt;<i> efforts...
</I>
You can find it here -
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/mono-soc-2010/source/browse/#svn/trunk/FSharpBinding.">http://code.google.com/p/mono-soc-2010/source/browse/#svn/trunk/FSharpBinding.</A>
The project wasn't completed successfully, and I'm not sure of the
current state of the addin. It was derived from an earlier effort by
Vasili I. Galchin at <A HREF="http://github.com/vasili/FSharpBinding.">http://github.com/vasili/FSharpBinding.</A>

There was also an older addin at
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/wildart/wiki/FSharpBinding">http://code.google.com/p/wildart/wiki/FSharpBinding</A> but we recommended
people not to use it because it was derived from old MD/#D GPL code,
which would not permit use of MS-PL code and libraries.
