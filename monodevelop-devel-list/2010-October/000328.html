&gt;<i> Hi, thanks for the reply!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Lluis will need to look at that; it sounds
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; like an issue in Mono.Addins. I've cc'd him.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Lluis - did you have any time to look into the issue, or is there any
</I>&gt;<i> other information that I could provide? If you had some idea how to
</I>&gt;<i> workaround the problem (for now), that would be very useful. I assume
</I>&gt;<i> that most of the people will use it on Linux or Mac, but it would be
</I>&gt;<i> nice to make it work on Windows too. Alternatively, I'll probably just
</I>&gt;<i> have ZIP download with files that people can copy to &quot;BackendBindings&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> directory...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; BTW, we have a public addin build server at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; <A HREF="http://addins.monodevelop.com/">http://addins.monodevelop.com/</A> that can build and publish open-source
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; addins against specific MonoDevelop versions...
</I>
Looks like this repository is not available anymore...

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This looks like a fantastic project - I'll definitely take a look if
</I>&gt;<i> we could host the F# plugin there once I'll have some more stable
</I>&gt;<i> version (and a bit of time).
</I>
It doesn't need to be stable to publish it there. You can set the add-in
as &quot;Alpha&quot; and will only appear in the alpha channel.

&gt;<i> One possible problem is that the plugin
</I>&gt;<i> is implemented in F#, so we'd probably need F# on your server... (I'm
</I>&gt;<i> not quite sure how difficult that would be - I'm not sure if the
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft's implementation of MSBUILD task would work on Mono, because
</I>&gt;<i> it wasn't needed for MonoDevelop support that I'm working on so far).
</I>
That's something we can try.

&gt;<i> Also, do you have any plans for supporting Mercurial source control in
</I>&gt;<i> a near future (that's what I currently use to host the project on
</I>&gt;<i> CodePlex, but I could probably switch to TFS with Subversion support).
</I>
I don't know Mercurial, but I'll take a look. It shouldn't be hard to
add support for it.

Lluis.
