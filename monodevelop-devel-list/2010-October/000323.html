<PRE>Hi, thanks for the reply!

&gt;&gt;<i> Lluis will need to look at that; it sounds
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like an issue in Mono.Addins. I've cc'd him.
</I>
Lluis - did you have any time to look into the issue, or is there any
other information that I could provide? If you had some idea how to
workaround the problem (for now), that would be very useful. I assume
that most of the people will use it on Linux or Mac, but it would be
nice to make it work on Windows too. Alternatively, I'll probably just
have ZIP download with files that people can copy to &quot;BackendBindings&quot;
directory...

&gt;&gt;<i> BTW, we have a public addin build server at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://addins.monodevelop.com/">http://addins.monodevelop.com/</A> that can build and publish open-source
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> addins against specific MonoDevelop versions...
</I>
This looks like a fantastic project - I'll definitely take a look if
we could host the F# plugin there once I'll have some more stable
version (and a bit of time). One possible problem is that the plugin
is implemented in F#, so we'd probably need F# on your server... (I'm
not quite sure how difficult that would be - I'm not sure if the
Microsoft's implementation of MSBUILD task would work on Mono, because
it wasn't needed for MonoDevelop support that I'm working on so far).
Also, do you have any plans for supporting Mercurial source control in
a near future (that's what I currently use to host the project on
CodePlex, but I could probably switch to TFS with Subversion support).

Thanks!
Tomas

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've been working on an F# Language Binding for MonoDevelop and I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trying to create a repository, so that people can install it using the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> standard tools. There are still some bugs in the Language Binding, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when I just copy the DLL to the &quot;BackendBindings&quot; directory in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MonoDevelop folder, then it seems to work okay (it requires F# and F#
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PowerPack in order to run). My testing repository is here:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.tomasp.net/monodevelop/">http://www.tomasp.net/monodevelop/</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The installation from the repository seems to work fine on Linux/Mono.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The installation reports some errors with the configuration and some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exception occurs when it loads (I guess), but that looks like my bugs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that I can fix (still, it installs and you can create new projects and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everything)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nice!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, I'm having more troubles on Windows/.NET (I'm testing it on a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clean Windows 7 machine with Gtk# and MonoDevelop installed using the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instructions from the web). When I go through the addin installation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> procedure, it installs the adding and just before showing the final
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dialog window (with success message and warnings), it shows an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Unhandled Exception.&quot; dialog with the following:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;snip&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I tried attaching to the process from VS debugger and it doesn't seem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to even load my &quot;FSharpBinding.dll&quot; assembly, so I'm wondering if this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could some issue in MonoDevelop itself? I tried creating a trivial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> language binding in C# and that worked okay, but I was able to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reproduce the error with the repository above on two different
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> machines. I can also send you the generated log file from the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> installation if you need more information.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I wasn't quite able to figure out what is going on (I think the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exception actually comes from Mono.Addins and I think I've seen errors
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like this when accidentally accessing GUI stuff from a background
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thread, but I'm not sure if that could be a problem here). Anyway,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this will be probably quite easy to find out for somebody who has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> properly setup environment with debug builds of all relevant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> libraries.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lluis will need to look at that; it sounds like an issue in

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PS: I think that the Visual Studio projects in monodevelop-2.4 &quot;tag&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (I used that version to make sure my adding works with latest stable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> version) incorrectly reference 4.0.0 versions of Mono.Addins etc. (see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for example <A HREF="http://github.com/mono/monodevelop/blob/monodevelop-2.4/main/src/core/MonoDevelop.Ide/MonoDevelop.Ide.csproj">http://github.com/mono/monodevelop/blob/monodevelop-2.4/main/src/core/MonoDevelop.Ide/MonoDevelop.Ide.csproj</A>).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I tried changed that to 5.0.0 on my machine, but it didn't resolve the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issue I was having.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There should be a GAC policy to make Mono.Addins 0.5 used for 0.4
</I>&gt;<i> references, so it shouldn't be an issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, we have a public addin build server at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://addins.monodevelop.com/">http://addins.monodevelop.com/</A> that can build and publish open-source
</I>&gt;<i> addins against specific MonoDevelop versions...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PS2: I noticed there was a project with the aim to implement F#
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support for MonoDevelop at the GSOC this year, but I couldn't find any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> outcomes of the project. Is that available somewhere? I tried
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contacting the person who worked on that, but with no luck (possibly,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I just got a wrong email). Anyway, I could probably contribute my work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to that project (or the other way round) to avoid duplication of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> efforts...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can find it here -
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/mono-soc-2010/source/browse/#svn/trunk/FSharpBinding.">http://code.google.com/p/mono-soc-2010/source/browse/#svn/trunk/FSharpBinding.</A>
</I>&gt;<i> The project wasn't completed successfully, and I'm not sure of the
</I>&gt;<i> current state of the addin. It was derived from an earlier effort by
</I>&gt;<i> Vasili I. Galchin at <A HREF="http://github.com/vasili/FSharpBinding.">http://github.com/vasili/FSharpBinding.</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There was also an older addin at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/wildart/wiki/FSharpBinding">http://code.google.com/p/wildart/wiki/FSharpBinding</A> but we recommended
</I>&gt;<i> people not to use it because it was derived from old MD/#D GPL code,
</I>&gt;<i> which would not permit use of MS-PL code and libraries.
