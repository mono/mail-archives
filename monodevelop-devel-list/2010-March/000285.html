<PRE>Hi,

We are planning a reorganization of the MonoDevelop code which involves
merging some of the assemblies. The goal is to reduce the number of
assemblies that need to be loaded, and to make it easier to link against
the core assemblies. There will be two main core assemblies:

      * New MonoDevelop.Core, which will contain the classes from:
              * MonoDevelop.Core
              * MonoDevelop.Projects

      * New MonoDevelop.IDE, with the classes from:
              * Mono.TextEditor
              * MonoDevelop.Components
              * MonoDevelop.Dock
              * MonoDevelop.Core.Gui
              * MonoDevelop.Projects.Gui
              * MonoDevelop.Ide

Other assemblies in Core won't change for now.

There will be some namespace changes too:

      * The MonoDevelop.Core.Gui will go away. Some classes will be
        moved to MonoDevelop.Components and some to
        MonoDevelop.Ide.Components.
      * Classes MonoDevelop.Projects.Gui.* will be moved to
        MonoDevelop.Ide.*

The idea is to keep the classes in Mono.* and MonoDevelop.Components.*
namespaces independent from the IDE infrastructure (even if they live in
the same assembly), so that they can be reused in other projects.

I plan to do the changes tomorrow, so if you are doing changes in any of
the core assemblies, make sure they are committed today (or you'll have
to deal with the conflicts).

Lluis.
