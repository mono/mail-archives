<PRE>Greetings all,

My name is Eugene Kulabuhov and I am a student, studying IT and
Electronics at Aarhus Technical College in Denmark.
I'm looking forward to join you in this year's Google Summer of Code program.

I am newbie to open source development and MonoDevelop particularly.
So I've been hacking using the latest version of MonoDevelop for a few
a days now.
And I have few questions:

1. Now I was thinking about adding some performance gain features,
like the ones found in ReSharper for Visual Studio. But I'm not sure,
if those features are welcome? I've seen your to-do list and it
doesn't say anything about it. So my question is, who should I ask, if
I wanted to work on those features?

2. I'm investigating few bugs from BugZilla. And I found the code
responsible for that bug, but as code is quite complex, I need to
clarify few things about the code before doing any fixes. Should I
contact the owner of that particular file? Or ask the question in this
list?

Thank you,
Eugene.
</PRE>
