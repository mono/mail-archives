<PRE>Hi everybody, I just want to introduce myself, my name is 
Juanfra and my nickname is pexi, I'm working as MSSQL DBA 
and SAP Netweaver administrator, I have written some 
applications on asp.net C# that improve my diary job, so I 
like to much the environment monodevelop, and I want help 
to improve the Monodevelop.Database extra, starting by 
SQL Server support because I know it better than another Databases. 
By the way I was reading the code of 
Monodevelop.Database.SQL.SqlServer and I find that it use 
sentences compatible with SQL Server 2000, and does not 
provide 100% compatibility with the new versions (SQL 2005 
and 2008).
I don't know what more can I say, only that I want to help 
you in this project, but I don't know how to begin (of 
course reading code, and following the guide 
<A HREF="http://monodevelop.com/Developers">http://monodevelop.com/Developers</A>)

I think that I could begin updating the sentences for SQL 
Server 2005/2008 and adding the support in the code to 
choose between versions. Other thing that could be improved 
is the support to connect without specifying the port, only 
SERVER\INSTANCE_NAME.

Please let me know if this is a good point to start or not.

P.S.: Sorry about my English.

Best regards
Pexi.

</PRE>
