<PRE>Hey guys,

Marc and I would like to start working on a Makefile target to create a
app directory for MonoDevelop (for Mac OSX).
Currently, building the app dir for OSX isn't streamlined and takes some
additional time on our part. If no one is already
working on this, I'd like to put a bit of time into it. I have the MD
source but am not too familiar with it. I was thinking about
doing most of the work in monodevelop/main/build/Makefile.am  since that
dir seems to have the built binaries.

If anyone has suggestions or tips, that would be great.

Rusty
