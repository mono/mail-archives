<PRE>Hi,

I&#8217;ve been accepted for Google Summer of Code with project &#8216;Support for 
ASP .NET MVC in MonoDevelop&#8217; where my goals for the second half of 
coding are to create Razor syntax highlighter and hopefully code 
completion engine. I&#8217;ve been investigating the existing code - the 
parsers, highlighters and code completion engines, especially those in 
AspNet Addin, and the relations between all those parts. I think I 
understand how they work, but I have some questions to the more 
experienced developers which could help me understand better the code 
and prepare a good, working implementation.

I&#8217;d like to start my implementation with syntax highlighter, which is 
probably an easier part. Creating XML syntax mode seems to not be enough 
for Razor syntax, so I decided to create the highlighter in C#, deriving 
from Mono.TextEditor.Highlighting.SyntaxMode. AspNet SyntaxMode may be a 
good reference here, because I&#8217;ll be facing similar issues related to 
passing some fragments from html to C# engines. Is it a good idea?

As you probably know, Razor parser was open-sourced a few weeks ago, so 
the best approach is to use the working solution and integrate it with 
MD. I&#8217;m trying to understand the code, and as I can see a lot of things 
were implemented, e.g. parser, tokenizer, editor-related classes 
(<A HREF="http://aspnetwebstack.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/a6a917711a44#src%2fSystem.Web.Razor%2fRazorEditorParser.cs">http://aspnetwebstack.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/a6a917711a44#src%2fSystem.Web.Razor%2fRazorEditorParser.cs</A>),as 
well as classes like AutoCompleteEditHandler, but I&#8217;m not yet aware to 
what extent it&#8217;ll be possible to use it in my project. My idea is to 
create wrappers around the open-sourced code and integrate them with MD 
architecture and extension points.Is it ok?

Generally, I have a vision of implementation, but I&#8217;d like to ask you 
for some high-level advice. Are there any pitfalls I can&#8217;t see, or 
should I avoid any specific approaches? As more experienced developers, 
maybe you have your own ideas or tips related to integrating the Razor 
parser with MD that might help me? Of course I&#8217;ll be investigating the 
code deeper and deeper and my vision of the project will soon get clear, 
but any help will be welcome, because I really would like to do this in 
a good, proper way.
Thanks in advance.
