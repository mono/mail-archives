<PRE>Hey,

Well, I just found this amazing success history, since it is Portuguese and
not everybody here can read (Andreia and Rodrigo ;-) then I made my free
translation. Maybe not so good translation but dont blame me, this English
series teach me speak a very bad english:

* Terra on-line Radio with Silverlight/Moonlight

After a long time I try Terra on-line radio to check if it back to work on
Linux. I just click on Blues radio and one window pop up  to tell me that
Microsoft Silverlight was necessary to hear the Terra radio. I was surprise
when I see that in bottom of window a link say: &quot;Linux users, click here to
see an alternative to hear Terra on-line radio&quot;. The link redirect to
Moonlight page.

So, I look at Mandriva repositories and moon was there. I installed and it
works! It is now playing &quot;Truth&quot; from &quot;Jeff Beck&quot; with a very good audio
quality.

I haven't decided if it is good or bad. Anyway, today we have an official
free alternative (despite of polemics) to play a proprietary format.

=====

And some nice comments, some of the is not complete and theres only &quot;...&quot;,
the beginning is enough to understand the contents.

=====

&quot;Here on ubuntu I can't hear anything, opens the player but no sound&quot;

&quot;Don't works on my puppylinux!&quot;

&quot;About 'if it is good or bad'. It is good for sure, good as Mono, bad is to
don't have alternatives like happens when uses ActiveX&quot;

&quot;I don't understand this choice for Silverlight...the junk... blablabla...&quot;

&quot;It is true, on Ubuntu Intrepid I haven't sound&quot;

&quot;Moonlight sucks... MS.. Novell... blablabla...&quot;

&quot;Terra on-line radio uses Silverlight? Humm, I have installed Moonlight some
time ago and think that it don't works because every silverlight site say
that Silverlight is not installed. I hear Terra online radio and it never
ask me for Silverlight, it works and only now I figure that it is using
Moonlight. It means that I was wrong about my &quot;bad concepts&quot; (maybe pre
concepts is better translation) about this tecnology. If it always runs so
transparent for user will be good. I did not know that it was so integrated
to browser&quot;

&quot;Here on Firefox it works very well, unfortunatelly it dont works in
Opera...&quot;

Congratulations you guys for amazing job!
Everaldo.
