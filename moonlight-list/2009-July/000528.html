<PRE>While I definitely don't speak for everyone, I'd assume our position is
this:

1) We're not feature complete yet.
2) The existing rendering engine works
3) We still have to do some optimisation passes to improve perf because we
do suck in certain cases.

So why would we waste man days/weeks rewriting code to use a slower less
mature engine when we already have perf issues and known bugs? If you want
to discuss the idea in detail you could join the #moonlight irc channel, or
maybe someone else will respond here, but for now I sincerely doubt the idea
would even be considered ;)

Alan.

</I>&gt;<i> Benefit of managed rendering engine is significant in my opinion.

</I>&gt;<i> Linux SL that can help find more forces to Moonlight team. And having more
</I>&gt;<i> managed and simple parts in ML makes development cycle simpler imho.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know why do you think Cairo+OpenGL better option. Have you checked
</I>&gt;<i> out sources of Cairo+Glitz? That's not several lines code change to make it
</I>&gt;<i> really work. Cairo is large, purpose of it was different and it's unmanaged
</I>&gt;<i> (and that also takes additional effort).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My question came up from Moonlight Notes where someone discussed pro and
</I>&gt;<i> contras of AGG vs Cairo.
</I>&gt;<i> Well - I've proposed to look on AGG Sharp. It's actually changes those
</I>&gt;<i> pro/contra a lot. It's not complete, but it's much simpler than any other
</I>&gt;<i> options. So it's achievable to finish it up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I just want to ask Moonlight team - those who extensively used Cairo - what
</I>&gt;<i> do you think about AGG Sharp? And second question is to Mono community -
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't it be great to target Moonlight as a Mono WPF also?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best Regards. Max.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pretty neat library (I've been keeping an eye on it ever since I found

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; especially considering that Silverlight 3 is already out!
