<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I've exposed the manual time source, and gotten to the point where I
</I>&gt;<i> can take a sample xaml file and let it render for a given period of
</I>&gt;<i> time, and capture all frames to a video file.  To make sure that the
</I>&gt;<i> framerate for embedded video files is fixed to my output framerate, I
</I>&gt;<i> changed MediaPlayer::AdvanceFrame () to base target_pts on
</I>&gt;<i> element-&gt;GetTimeManager()-&gt;GetCurrentTime () regardless of the audio
</I>&gt;<i> track.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now I'm looking to capture the audio.  From looking at the source, it
</I>&gt;<i> appears that I need to subclass AudioSource, and AudioPlayer, and
</I>&gt;<i> somehow use the Write methods from AudioSource to capture audio frames
</I>&gt;<i> and mix them together with any other audio frames that are currently
</I>&gt;<i> playing.  I have very little experience with audio, so I was hoping
</I>&gt;<i> for some pointers on how to accomplish this task.  It appears that I
</I>&gt;<i> will need to loop through the sources list and capture the audio data
</I>&gt;<i> per source, and then somehow do any necessary conversions between
</I>&gt;<i> different sample rates.  The other thing that seems like it will be
</I>&gt;<i> troublesome is synchronizing the audio to the video.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
To capture audio and write audio data to disk you have to:

* Subclass AudioSource (I'll call the subclass DiskSource here).

* DiskSource has to create a new thread and run a method which every
  now and then calls AudioSource::Write to get the raw audio data and
  writes that to disk. The 'every now and then' could be something like
  every 250 ms, and you have to request 250 ms of audio data when calling
  AudioSource::Write.

* You have to override AudioSource::GetDelayInternal: here you must 
  calculate the difference between the last audio sample you got and
  what you should be playing when the method is called (example: you
  call AudioSource::Write and get 250 ms of audio data. 100 ms later
  DiskSource::GetDelayInternal is called, and you must return the 
  difference between those numbers, i.e. 150 ms). This method is required
  to sync video with the audio.

* Subclass AudioPlayer (DiskPlayer).

* Override the virtual methods of AudioPlayer you have to override, the
  most important being CreateNode, here you just return an instance of
  DiskSource. I'm pretty sure the other virtual methods will just be
  nops.

* Modify AudioPlayer::CreatePlayer to return a DiskPlayer instead of 
  Alsa/PulsePlayer.

If you have multiple media files playing at the same time, you can either
mix the audio yourself in DiskSource and write it all to one file, or 
write each audio to its own file and use some other (audio editing) 
program later to mix the audio.

Rolf

&gt;<i> Any ideas, corrections, info, etc on how to get this working would be
</I>&gt;<i> very welcome.  Thanks!
