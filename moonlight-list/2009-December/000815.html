<PRE>Hi,


&gt;&gt;<i>There is no Visual Studio solution [1], but there is a MonoDevelop
</I>solution&#160;(moon.mds in moon's root directory)

&gt;<i> I can't find that file in&#160;moonlight-2.0.tar.bz2. I can't even find the
</I>folder called moon in that bz2 file.&#160;

moon would be the toplevel folder in that case. In any case that file is
probably not in the tarball (since it's not required to build moonlight),
you might want to check out the sources from svn
(<A HREF="http://mono-project.com/Moonlight#Working_from_SVN">http://mono-project.com/Moonlight#Working_from_SVN</A>).

&gt;&gt;<i>Note that Moonlight most likely won't build on&#160;Windows.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh.. Then, I will have to link the file manually. Are you guys going to
</I>add sln file in future? Are you going to accept sln file if community
contribute it for Moonlight? I'm sure that both Silverlight community and
Moonlight are really interested to read the source code of moonlight to
understand more details about how SIlverlight works.&#160;

We'll gladly accept community patches/fixes.

Rolf

Thanks.

There is no Visual Studio solution [1], but there is a MonoDevelop solution
(moon.mds in moon's root directory). This is not the way moonlight is built
though, we use makefiles. Note that Moonlight most likely won't build on
Windows.

[1] There is one in moon/build/vs2008, but it only contains a project for
libmoon (the code in moon/src), not everything.

Michael&#160;
