&gt; Sebastien I had posted but wasn't subscribed. Anyway, thanks for your
&gt; response. On a side note, obviously it's possible for the CoreCLR to
&gt; p/invoke 

Of course it is :) I said that &quot;user/application code&quot; could not, but
&quot;platform code&quot; (i.e. what we ship with moonlight) is able to p/invoke
and do all the other tricks (not an issue since we're also responsible
for any security issue with our shipping code).

&gt; and I know that Microsoft has added 3D graphics support. It would be
&gt; awesome if moonlight added support for 3D audio.
&gt; Is it possible to add a feature request for 3D audio support?

You can open a bug report (bugzilla.novell.com) for feature requests
but, honestly, we're quite busy to close the gaps between Moonlight and
Silverlight - so it's unlikely we'll extend the platform any time soon.

Another option is to request this feature to Microsoft itself
(connect.microsoft.com). If it becomes a feature of future Silverlight
version (e.g. 4.0) then we're more likely to implement it, someday ;-)

&gt; Thanks, Reese.

&gt;         &gt; Will it be possible to do p/invoke in Moonlight?
&gt;         
&gt;         
&gt;         No, just like Silverlight it won't be possible from the
&gt;         plugin.
&gt;         
&gt;         User/application code is prohibited from calling platform
&gt;         code, defining
&gt;         internal calls, unsafe code... because all of those actions
&gt;         would break
&gt;         the sandbox offered by CoreCLR.
&gt;         
&gt;         &gt; I'd like to p/invoke to the
&gt;         &gt; OpenAL c++ dll for audio in an online game. Thanks.
&gt;         
&gt;         
&gt;         You can use most of Moonlight assemblies/features from a
&gt;         &quot;desktop&quot;
&gt;         application. In that case CoreCLR is not enabled and you'll be
&gt;         able to
&gt;         pinvoke whatever you like (but that won't be hosted inside a
&gt;         web
&gt;         browser).
