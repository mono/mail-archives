Well AFAIR in Ubuntu I had to tick something but I tried it in Fedora today because I have a virtual system of it and it claims to be &quot;bleeding edge&quot;. After I installed ACR this time the words &quot;Compatability Checking Disabled&quot; appeared at the top of the Add-ons window without me doing anything else and Moonlight then installed from file (save-link-as the xpi)

&gt;<i> Is this a Gnome vs KDE issue, given I run under KDE?? Or?????
</I>
I didn't give much time to trying Konqueror, but I remember that when a site redirected to &quot;Install Silverlight&quot;, it refused to redirect from there to &quot;Install Moonlight&quot; as Firefox and Chromium did. I think the Ms site does the redirection and only recognises Linux Firefox and Chromium. I have heard that IceWeasel isn't recognised either though the Firefox Moonlight Plug-in will install and work in it. Of course Linux Opera isn't recognised because sadly it doesn't work with Moonlight (or does it, someone?)
So, with KDE, Firefox will work but Konqueror won't.

&gt;<i> Moonlight now works on:

</I>&gt;<i> but I can't seem to get it working on anything on:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://fixplay.ninemsn.com.au/catalogue.aspx">http://fixplay.ninemsn.com.au/catalogue.aspx</A>

</I>&gt;<i> Could you check that site and let me know if it works for you?  Maybe it has

I couldn't get either of those working. The former started with the percentage loading in a circle of o's on a white background, just like I got with <A HREF="http://go.sky.com">http://go.sky.com</A> but then came a message starting &quot;You are running a Silverlight 4 application...&quot; which disappeared too fast to read it all, then a black background with a start &quot;&gt;&quot; icon in the middle and some controls at the bottom. Switching to and from full-screen worked but the video would not play. On the bottom left, after the &quot;II&quot; pause icon, part on the URL appeared, replaced by &quot;00:00:00&quot; when the &quot;&gt;&quot; was clicked, but that was it, the seconds never began increasing.
The videos at fixplay.ninemsm.com.au only showed a white background, no percentage loading at all, just quite a few different URLs in the status line from which it was loading, for quite a while, but then nothing.

Now it might be lack of RAM - I'm only using a netbook with 1GB, but the vmware Fedora had 2.5GB and go.sky.com showed exactly the same symptoms.

I have seen Moonlight working excellently many months ago. It did take a long while to catch up with Silverlight 2, though, and maybe it now needs to catch up with Silverlight 4, or at least the different ways of implementing it.
That v2 was with itv.com who have since switched to Adobe Flash, thank goodness.
