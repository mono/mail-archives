Hello.

I know it's hard time of preparing to MIX10, but I hope that question is not
that hard.

We are researching the question of building video application for Sigma
Design based computer
(<A HREF="http://www.sigmadesigns.com/media_processor_overview.php">http://www.sigmadesigns.com/media_processor_overview.php</A>). And we want to
try to use MoonlightDesktop (<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/MoonlightDesktop">http://www.mono-project.com/MoonlightDesktop</A>)
approach for that. Sigma not the only target platform for us - we need x86
systems and even probably ARM later, but MIPS looks most challenging here.

Here are several questions I have:

1. Is it possible to use Mono on MIPS (which is inside Sigma SoC)? I've seen
port done, but haven't tried it, don't know limitations and don't understand
what's up with license on this port.

2. Is it possible to route video and audio to Sigma SDK, because it's
impossible to use software decoders due to the processor weakness? And how
hard that could be? Any problems with mixing that with other semitransparent
XAML content on top or behind?

3. What could be general GUI drawing performance on that processor (667 MHz
MIPS 74K CPU + FPU + 64bit 1GB DDR667)? Will it work at all there?

4. What other problems we might expect on this way?

Please share your ideas and insights on that - we really need your help in
that area and can bring something useful to Moonlight project during this
work later.

Thank you very much.
Max
