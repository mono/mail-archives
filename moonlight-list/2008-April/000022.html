<PRE>Hi Guys.

I'm starting to work on Lunar Eclipse as part of the Google Summer of
Code Program. The first problem I have encountered is that currently
LE is broken. This exception is thrown:

Unhandled Exception: System.Exception: The surface where the xaml
should be loaded is not set.

This is because somewhere in the code, this is called within a
System.Windows.Controls.Control child:

ellipse = (Ellipse)InitializeFromXaml(&quot;&lt;Ellipse Name=\&quot;Ellipse\&quot; /&gt;&quot;);

The exception is thrown because LE is an application with multiple
surfaces (One for the canvas, another for the timeline, etc) and the
Loader didn't know which surface to use.

I could easily fix this loading the ellipse using
GtkSilver.InitializeFromXaml(). But this problem made me question
about some of the Moonlight internals.

My first question is: Why a XamlLoader needs a Surface?

Looking at GtkSilver's code, the proper way to initialize an object
when the application uses multiple surface is to specify the surface
to the XamlLoader:

loader = XamlLoader.CreateManagedXamlLoader (surface, plugin);

The problem is that the Surface class is not exposed to C#, I believe
that is not part of the Silverlight API. I don't know why this surface
must be specified when loading the Xaml. I have been looking at the
XamlLoader c++ code, and apparently, the only reason is to assign the
surface to the loaded object. I believe that maybe it's better not to
set this at Xaml Loading time. Maybe should be assigned when the
object is added to a parent.

Second question: Why AllowMultipleSurfacesPerDomain is handled within
XamlLoader and why it's needed at all? Has MS Silverlight a concept
similar for handling this?

I am starting to understand the Moonlight internals, so please excuse
me if I'm making dump questions.

Manuel.
