MS already has a tool that does the same  ActiveX...which has the same 
platform issues but does run on more browsers it would be wise to avoid the 
same mistakes.

Anyway JavaScript and HTML5 is going from strength to strength with better 
tooling such as the new javascript libs  (eg Knockout for MMVM and binding 
, Ria Services for JavaScript , MVC4 )  and faster compilers , while i 
prefer C# /Xaml its ARM support will always be limited and while Windows 8 
will soon support ARM - the C# on Metro apps ( which arm will only support) 
is very cut down it doesn't even support inheritance in the CTP  - obviously 
for Linux clients  you have an issue.  With native hookins for rendering 
anything that needs to be super fast can be sent to a C# service.

Anyway to be realistic Tablets and smart phones will get more and more 
important even in corporate circles while i don't think PCs will be less 
important they will be a smaller slice of the market.

Microsoft has made it very clear they will support Apple a bit ( Silverlight 
, Notes  , Office , Early IE ) , they will not support Linux /Android . ( 
And Apple does even less for Microsoft  and Linux) .

So the real question for green fields apps is WinRt  (C++ or with a .NET 
wrapper ) or HTML5 (JavaScript or native client) ?
