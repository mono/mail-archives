<PRE>On MS side of fence, you see talk of SL &quot;is dead&quot; too, and is SL5 the 
last, etc.
If SL5 is last (from MS), then apparently it will have support for up to 
10 years .
Xamarin focus on their product  (mono to API's of devices for their 
native GUI) makes it unlikely (as noted below)
Xamarin will put much into it. Not sure how winRT and html5 fits into it 
either.
I have done a lot of SL4 and deployed on MS and Linux, with some  minor 
issues on the Linux compat. side (using the pre4 release).
My own thinking is, assume ML is dead  (assume worst hope for better), 
but that its fairly viable for projects at SL4 level, and build (if you 
can) to that version
and test on both ML and SL. I am not even sure what goodies are out for 
SL5 release, SL4 seems to do everything I want,
and I see mentioned in MS boards, that SL5 (and SL4 to some extent as 
well) is so mature, not having a SL6 is no great issue (at least POV of 
now).
For ML# to continue, I am assuming it will need contribution from the 
community mainly, and not assume much will come from Xamarin?
Not knowing MS plans with SL as well make it all very complicated. I am 
going to keep writting to ML4b (SL3-4) version for a few years yet,
but will keep abreast of other tech as well.
