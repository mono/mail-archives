</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I see no activity in the mailing list and github; Silverlight 5 is
</I>&gt;<i> already released, Moonlight is two versions behind; does it all mean
</I>&gt;<i> that Moonlight is dead? Will there be any successor for moonlight or
</I>&gt;<i> we may consider silverlight as dead platform for cross-platform
</I>&gt;<i> webapplications?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> None of the developers that used to work full time on Moonlight are working
</I>full time on Moonlight anymore.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some work for Xamarin now, some have gone on different paths.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some of the work that we did for Moonlight improved Mono in many significant
</I>ways (a stable IL verifier, a working sandbox, coreclr security, error recovery
and much more). &#160; Some of the other work I believe is a gold mine of technology,
in particular our media pipeline, the rendering/layout code and the animation
framework. &#160; Perhaps someone would find a use for that code in the future, we
currently do not have plans to continue developing Moonlight.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are several reasons. &#160; From a community perspective, we never managed to
</I>get much traction to get contributions to improve the stack and share the
development effort with. &#160;This had the very negative side effect that without a
sponsored team, Moonlight development would quickly stop.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Although Microsoft released some key bits of the style and controls from
</I>Silverlight 2 to use in Moonlight 2, the more advanced and complex components
for supporting 3 and 4 were not yet open sourced, so those areas in Moonlight
suffer as an effect.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Silverlight vision was on a great path (despite some bloat making it into
</I>its design, or some very complicated and over-engineered bits of technology
making it into the stack). &#160; But key components that would have allowed
Silverlight to become a real cross-platform framework were cut from the
releases, like full File System Access which just doomed Silverlight to be a
web-only plugin. &#160; Silverlight's fate was sealed when they started supporting
Windows-only features in the plugin.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I felt that Silverlight had a bright future, and that it could turn to fill an
</I>important void, not only for web development, but for desktop development in
general. &#160;And this was largely one of my motivators. &#160; I am very sad that
Microsoft strategy cut the air supply to Silvelright.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, Microsoft seems to be going back to a Windows-only vision of the
</I>world. &#160; They have a third reimplementation of the XAML/UI stack, this time on
top of WinRT. &#160;
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do not think that a full open source WinRT stack makes sense at this point
</I>for two reasons: &#160;(a) the world has changed and developers now believe in
writing the business logic once, and multiple UIs (for example, a desktop UI and
a web UI, or a desktop UI and a mobile UI) and (b) because judging by previous
experience, we would hardly get contributors, we would be 12-24 months late to
get some apps on Mac/Linux.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At this point, I just advise developers to write their apps by splitting their
</I>UI from their engine code. &#160; This ensures that you will have a great UI
experience on every platform (Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, Windows and Web) and
that the only thing preventing you from shipping your code is not a third party
catching up to the latest Microsoft APIs, but yourself.

Hi,

It sounds like the community is what is available to get anything going. Does
anyone know if it would be possible to get the final, or the most appropriate,
version 4 pre-release available, as 3.99 is? I'm thinking it would not be a lot
of work.

I, and other non-programmer types, would be able to use it to get some
compatibility with sites that need SL4. 

I'm glad to help whatever way I can, but I'm not up to programming or compiling.

Cheers!
