I'm not sure I understand the issue. AFAIK everything in System.IO* that
takes a path or filename is decorated with [SecurityCritical]. That
means the entry points are easy to find and &quot;control&quot; (e.g. ensuring a
fully expanded path within a root). Which API are those ?

        * &#65279;and elsewhere, with the notable exception of IsolatedStorage

In that respect the unmanaged API dealing with paths and filenames are
more problematic.

</I>
We still need un-rooted (or semi-rooted) file i/o access for other
things, like IsolatedStorage (which is related* but not relative to
XAP ;-).

        * url and site

&gt;<i>     Maintenance-wise this is not as bad as it sounds, this namespace

</I>
The solution is still interesting, since cruft removal could remove
potential bugs that would be much more problematic in Moonlight than
they would be for a regular desktop application.
