Probably for the best.

Right, the Gtk# control is in a sorry state right now, we've moved a
bunch of things around to better support the deployment/application
model in SL2 and those changes havn't been reflected on the managed
bindigns yet.  I unfortunately don't have an ETA on when we're going to
get those cleaned up, however it shouldn't be too hard if you guys
wanted to undertake it.  If you look at deployment.cpp and plugin.cpp
you can see where most of the deployment spin-up happens in the plugin,
some of that will simply need to be cut out for the managed side.  I'm
sure there are a few other issues with the managed bindings, and there's
bound to be more as we clean up the Surface/Deployment code more, so
unfortunately it will likely remain a moving target for the next while.

To clarify are you having trouble loading xap's in the managed bindings
or in the browser?

&gt;<i> On a side note, I asked the list a while ago if there was any intent

</I>&gt;<i> decoding working for a variety of formats and containers, and if
</I>&gt;<i> anyone is interested, just let me know what the best means of
</I>&gt;<i> publishing it are.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Sure I'd love to see the patch.  Just make a new thread on the list and
attach it.

Thanks
