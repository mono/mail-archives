<PRE>Hey,

I've been writing a few extra NUnit tests and came across a few bugs in the
timeline handling, but I don't want to commit these changes because I have a
few questions on them first and I know a few things will have to be altered.

First, here's what changed and why:
1) Storyboard::root_clock is gone. Timeline::clock has been added.
Reason: We need to fire Timeline::CompletedEvent when the corresponding
Clock::CompletedEvent is raised. So all Timelines need to store their clock
so we can hook/unhook from the events. Logic which used to check for the
root_clock not being null now checks for (clock &amp;&amp; !GetHasParent). This is
the logical equivalent of the old check.

2) Clock *AllocateClock () has changed into: void AllocateClock () and void
DeallocateClock ()
Reason: We are now storing the clock inside the Timeline so this provides an
easy way of telling each timeline to drop its clock reference and unhook
from any clock events. This method is called as part of the existing
TeardownClockGroup method.

Things I want to change:
static void timeline_completed (EventObject *sender, EventArgs *calldata,
gpointer data);

I want to change this into a virtual method so that subclasses of timeline
can do cleanup before/after the Completed event has been raised. The benefit
of this is that Storyboard can then override the virtual method so it can
tear down the clock group *before* emitting the completed event. The current
way of doing this is a hack (remove the handler for timeline_completed and
add one to storyboard_completed).

Does that sound good? Also, any comments on the patch itself?

Thanks,
Alan.

p.s. A small bit of extra cleanup will need to be applied to DispatcherTimer
to handle this change. It's not in the above patch though.
