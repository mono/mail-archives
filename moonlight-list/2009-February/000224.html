<PRE>I realize that you guys are in the middle of some large reworks as you move
towards supporting Silverlight 2.0, so rather than banging my head against
the wall, I thought I would just ask.

We have an svn checkout for moonlight, and the Gtk# control doesn't seem to
be working (seems to be related to initializing mono twice).  I don't
believe that it is because of the changes my team has made, but I thought I
would ask if it is working from svn trunk for you guys.  There also seem to
be troubles in loading xap files (something related to the Deployment object
if I recall correctly).  If these impressions are wrong, please let me
know.  Otherwise, do you have any idea on how soon trunk might get to a
point where these components are working again?

On a side note, I asked the list a while ago if there was any intent to get
mpeg4/h264/aac decoding working for the future silverlight 3 support, and
the answer was not at the moment.  I thought I would mention that we have a
working patch to get ffmpeg demuxing and decoding working for a variety of
formats and containers, and if anyone is interested, just let me know what
the best means of publishing it are.

Thanks for any information you can provide.

Dan
