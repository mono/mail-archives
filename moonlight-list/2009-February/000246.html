Why can't we get to a &quot;Dispose&quot; call to break the circle? 

&gt;<i>From what I gathered from irc you came to the conclusion that managed code
</I>can't manage lifetime (using weakrefs, etc), since objects would get freed
too early, which only leaves native code to manage lifetime, and then
&quot;Dispose&quot; is a way to break the circle (and I can't think of any other way
which wouldn't be the same thing).

Rolf
 
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>that involves making unmanaged code additionally deal with GCHandles in all
</I>cases where we accept function pointers now.&#160; I agree we need some mechanism
for cleaning up delegates, but I'm not sure GCHandling everything is the way
to &gt;go. The delegate will be alive as long as the managed object or
unmanaged peer is alive. When the unmanaged peer dies, the GCHandle will be
deallocated in unmanaged.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>But see, that doesn't work.&#160; The unmanaged peer will never die when it's
</I>holding a GCHandle to a delegate which is keeping the managed instance
alive, which holds a ref to the unmanaged peer. We can't even get to a
&quot;Dispose&quot; call in order to clean up the delegates and break refs in this
scenario.&#160; The instant we pass a delegate to unmanaged code (be it in
GCHandle form or after storing it in an instance field of the managed
object), we're screwed at present.

&gt;&gt;<i>Hey,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>So the next iteration of the idea would be to register a GCHandle which
</I>holds the delegate instead of the delegate itself (or something similar).
Then the same principle holds true. The delegate will be alive as long as
the managed &gt;&gt;object or unmanaged peer is alive. When the unmanaged peer
dies, the GCHandle will be deallocated in unmanaged. Managed code won't have
to care about the GCHandle as long as a unique GCHandle is passed to native
every time a &gt;&gt;&gt;delegate is passed to native.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>It really isn't that easy.&#160; Just one of the interesting cases: we have

same object.&#160; So we have circular refs between unmanaged and managed peers
which &gt;aren't &gt;&gt;direct.&#160; We really need a system that can treat either as
the root.&#160; Anything else is going to be unable to handle things properly.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Hey guys,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>I've been thinking about the issue and I think one way to solve it would
</I>be to always have unmanaged own the handle. What I'm thinking is this:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>1) If managed holds a reference to the object, then it'll live
</I>regardless of GCHandle status
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>2) If unmanaged holds a GCHandle, unmanaged will keep it alive
</I>regardless of what managed does.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>3) If managed has no reference to the object and unmanaged drops its
</I>reference, then the object is safe to be GC'ed.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>So to implement that logic all we really need to do is to allocate a
</I>GCHandle every time we pass a managed object to native and always let native
clean up the handle. So whenever we destroy a Value * we should deallocate
the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;GCHandle if that's the last reference to the GCHandle that unmanaged
has.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Does that make sense or have I missed some important case?
