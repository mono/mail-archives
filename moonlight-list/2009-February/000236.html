<PRE>Chris,

Thanks for this thorough clarification/explanation. Your FFMpeg reasoning is
just as I suspected as is the entire LiveCD &quot;issue&quot;.

I'd also like to thank the rest of your team on a job well-done. I grabbed
the Moonlight 1.0 xpi to watch the Obama Inauguration last month and it
worked brilliantly!

On behalf of all the intelligent and sane FLOSS users, we salute your hard
work,

Dan

&gt;<i> to be a little more clear, let me spell some things out:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. you are free to compile the ffmpeg codecs on your own and build
</I>&gt;<i> your own version of moonlight.  We still do this for testing, as it
</I>&gt;<i> requires an abstracted media layer, a feature we like because it
</I>&gt;<i> provides for the possibility of using gstreamer for desktop usage,
</I>&gt;<i> something I wish we had more time to work on... patches welcome :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. I would *not* suggest you compile ffmpeg codecs and statically (or
</I>&gt;<i> even dynamically) link them into a version of moonlight and
</I>&gt;<i> redistribute that.  I mean, you could, but then you're entering into a
</I>&gt;<i> very gray area (it's really not even gray.  it's very, very black.) of
</I>&gt;<i> MPEG-LA licenses.  Since you're now distributing code that decodes
</I>&gt;<i> patented formats, don't come crying to us when someone sues you for
</I>&gt;<i> license payments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. #2 is the reason why we don't distribute codecs with our binary
</I>&gt;<i> moonlight releases.  We *can't*, unless we want to become licensees
</I>&gt;<i> from MPEG-LA and pay some non-trivial $ amount for every download.
</I>&gt;<i> Clearly we don't want to do this :)  Welcome to the world of media
</I>&gt;<i> formats.  Our hands are tied here, but I don't think we have to win
</I>&gt;<i> that battle to provide something people are going to want to use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. You are more than free to disable ffmpeg as well as the MS codec
</I>&gt;<i> download in moonlight.  Saying a codec free moonlight is &quot;a rifle
</I>&gt;<i> without guns&quot; is selling moonlight 2.0 a little short, since it
</I>&gt;<i> contains a full control library.  Basically a codec-less moonlight 2.0
</I>&gt;<i> is more than enough to build any RIA (i hate that acronym) that
</I>&gt;<i> *isn't* a media player.  But of course moonlight 2.0 requires mono,
</I>&gt;<i> which I'm certain will be just as distasteful as the codec arrangement
</I>&gt;<i> to some people.  It's really their loss, though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5. The LGPL permits distribution of object code linked into other,
</I>&gt;<i> non-LGPL (or GPL) object code, under one condition only:  The person
</I>&gt;<i> who downloads the object code from *you* must be able to edit the
</I>&gt;<i> source and replace the LGPL'ed portions with their own version.  This
</I>&gt;<i> usually just means you need a .so.  If you statically link moonlight
</I>&gt;<i> into some product of yours, you're in violation of the LGPL.  That
</I>&gt;<i> part is pretty easy to understand.  All the &quot;additional terms&quot; as
</I>&gt;<i> others call them - they are not additions to the license in any form.
</I>&gt;<i> They are just a clarification, since the LGPL was written way before
</I>&gt;<i> we had to worry about these things.  Embedded systems are essentially
</I>&gt;<i> a statically linked executable, usually in a ROM, although sometimes
</I>&gt;<i> distributed on game media.  Clearly you can't replace the moonlight in
</I>&gt;<i> that system from source (unless you have some wonderful devkit - but
</I>&gt;<i> in that case, you aren't everyone.)  So the additional license terms
</I>&gt;<i> are available from novell for these instances.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 6. LiveCD's are not considered embedded systems, even by the FSF, for
</I>&gt;<i> reasons that are pretty easy to see.  It *is* possible for anyone to
</I>&gt;<i> take a livecd, replace moonlight, and build another livecd.  It
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't have to be a comfortable process, or even necessarily easy.
</I>&gt;<i> It just has to be technically possible.  I don't understand why this
</I>&gt;<i> is being brought up in just the moonlight case.  Clearly it's okay
</I>&gt;<i> enough for gcc and rest of the GNU toolchain.  Suddenly it's not ok
</I>&gt;<i> for moonlight?  I don't get it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wasn't it jwz who said &quot;When all you have is a hammer, every nail
</I>&gt;<i> looks like a thumb.&quot;?  This is not a fight, there is no gray area.
</I>&gt;<i> The only people who see a fight (or a need for one), or see a gray
</I>&gt;<i> area, are those who are specifically looking for one.
