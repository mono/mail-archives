<PRE>Hi,

I'm the current maintainer for the soon-to-be-released Moonlight 
packages for Debian/Ubuntu. I was wondering what measures - if any - 
would be taken to ensure that users visiting the official Moonlight site 
- e.g. as a result of clicking an &quot;Install Silverlight&quot; button - would 
be made aware that packages are available for their distribution. I 
understand that openSUSE 11.1 already includes packages, so is another 
distro where users ought to be told that distro packages exist.

I have absolutely no doubts that the .xpi files currently offered are 
the best way to offer Moonlight to &quot;any&quot; user, as fast and up to date as 
possible, with minimal fuss. However, there are plenty of cases where a 
distro package is a good idea (e.g. easily allowing its inclusion in a 
default install on custom-spun media), and I feel users running those 
distros should be at least made aware that they have a choice.

Ideally, I envisage the download page offering something a little like 
the Banshee download page - with a generic &quot;Linux&quot; link both by default 
and with a bigger icon. Other distros which are known to offer Moonlight 
should have an icon leading to instructions (like Banshee does), but 
perhaps with only the detected OS in color, and non-detected distros 
with a grey icon. Or something like that.

Thoughts? I think making it clear that many distros offer Moonlight will 
help to reinforce its image as something safe &amp; supported at a distro level
</PRE>
