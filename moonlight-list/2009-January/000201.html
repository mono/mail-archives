<PRE>I'm currently working on a project involving moonlight that would
benefit greatly from the ability to support playing mpeg4 / h264 / aac
encoded video files.

&gt;<i>From some information I have read online, it appears that Microsoft
</I>intends to add support for this format combo in silverlight 3.  If
they do intend to add this support, moonlight obviously will need it
as well.

So my question is this: are there any plans to add support for this
yet, and if there are, how soon?  If there aren't any plans, what
would need to be worked on to add support?  It appears that the
pipeline* files are the most important to be modified, but I'm not
entirely sure how much needs to be added (pipeline-ffmpeg.cpp looks to
be pretty generic, so I'm hoping that moonlight just needs to be told
to try to play the files, and then the Ffmpeg* classes will handle
it).

Anyways, any info is appreciated, and thanks for the awesome product
and  all of the great work!
