<PRE>There are a few of the font tests that fails randomly, this is because they:

.         Use big fonts which take a long time to download.

.         There is no DownloadCompleted event for fonts.

.         When running in the test harness it looks like mozilla doesn't use
the cache, it always downloads everything (this breaks a hack some of the
tests are using: they download the font first with a downloader, and in the
DownloaderCompleted event actually use the font).

.         For some reason mozilla is a limiting factor for fast (localhost)
downloads (20mb shouldn't take &gt; 30 seconds to download from localhost). I
tried  to download with NP_ASFILEONLY  to prevent mozilla from streaming to
us, but it didn't help a bit. I also profiled to figure out if we're doing
anything dumb, and most of the time (&gt;90% from what I remember) is spent
inside some routine in mozilla which shuffles memory around.

 

We could of course crank up the test timeout before taking the screenshot to
something really big (5 minutes), however that will add 5 minutes to every
single test run on the buildbot for every test that has this problem (the
timeout is already at 30-60 seconds, depending on the test).

 

Here is a patch that tries to deal with this, it:

.         For all simple urls (<A HREF="http://domain[:port]/path">http://domain[:port]/path</A>) it saves the url
and the local file path into a cache. 

.         Whenever the same url is requested, just serve from the cache (it
only serves when whoever requested the download didn't request the data to
be streamed - which means that media for instance will never get data from
the cache). 

 

Issues: 

.         This will probably have issues if the url was given with some sort
of no-cache directive to prevent caching (or any other ways the caching was
disabled by the server).

 

Thoughts?

 

Rolf
