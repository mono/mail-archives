<PRE>Hello moonlight list!

This is a brain dump of all the issues I remember from last week when
I finished work on the provisional moonlight 4 sdk. They're in no
particular order :)

1) Debug support
Issue: The section of code which initiates SDB is only compiled in
builds which define the DEBUG symbol. This means that regular release
builds cannot have a debugger attached. Do we want all our release
builds to be debuggable or do we want to have a separate 'Developer'
runtime which has debug support enabled.

Solution: We can either enable debug support in release builds
(security issue?) or have a separate moonlight-developer-plugin which
will collide with/replace the regular moonlight-plugin.

2) Codecs
Issue: The packages I built on the opensuse buildservice have no codec
support so we'll need to build/release the SDK as part of our normal
moonlight plugin release cycle.

Solution: As stated in the issue :P

3) Interpackage dependencies
Issue: To develop moonlight applications I need to install
moonlight-web-devel. This requires moonlight-tools, which in turn has
a dependency on moonlight-desktop-devel. This seems backwards. What
i'd expect is that there's a moonlight-tools package with zero
dependencies which is then required by moonlight-web-devel and
moonlight-desktop-devel respectively.

Solution: Modify the packages as outlined above unless there's an
important reason why moonlight-tools requires moonlight-desktop-devel.
If there is a reason, the offending file in the moonlight-tools
package should probably be moved to moonlight-desktop-devel.

The most important issue is #1. The other two are minor enough and can
be fixed easily. Other than that the only thing needed (I think) is to get
proper user testing of the packages and make sure that everything works
exactly as expected when developing applications. I'll put some more
work into that during the week and try to get an official release of the SDK
soon!

Alan.
