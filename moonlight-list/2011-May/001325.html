<PRE>Hi Alan,

&gt;<i> I got my VM set up for WPF development and it looks like WPF takes the easy approach - it copies GAC assemblies local to the application. WPF appears to be incapable of loading assemblies from the GAC as my application fails to start up when I remove the local assembly. I don't see a good reason to deviate from this behaviour as it would be what anyone developing with WPF would expect when working with moonlight-desktop. With this approach you wouldn't need an appmanifest.xaml file.

If you're doing that you'd be much better off using an appmanifest file which could be autogenerated at compile time and embedded/distributed with your application. I don't know exactly how dynamically loaded assemblies would work in the WPF case, I haven't tested that yet. It's probable that these would be accessible via xaml but I'd need to test.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So at the moment I'm quite content with doing what WPF does unless there's a very good reason not to. Anyone care to chime in on why we should deviate? Also, if we're deviating, outline why you're deviating and what the pros/cons of it would be.
</I>
All good points, In most cases personally I would be happy with whatever means
I do not need the AppManifest, In &quot;normal&quot; applications, where the xmlns
contains &quot;assembly=&quot; I would expect my 'user' assembly to be loaded by the xaml
parser from the program directory.

I would not expect the 'load assemblies manually yourself' to be the default 
behavior but would very much like the ability to provide assemblies manually.

My main motivation for adding assemblies at runtime was my application
is a xaml editor and as such can't possibly expect anything all that useful to
my users to be in my program directory at runtime.

Much like monop.exe or csharp.exe my program accepts -r:path/to/assembly.dll as a
command line argument.  When supplied, the user can use 
'xmlns:foo=clr-namespace:MyNamespace;...' in the xaml window.

Even better would be a user callback that the xaml parser could call when
it fails to load an assembly/type so that I could supply it with one.

On a side note, it would also be helpful for me to tell the xaml loader to
ignore x:Class when not running via an xap in desktop mode.

Best Regards

Ian
