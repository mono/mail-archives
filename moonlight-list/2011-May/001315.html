&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; moonlight-desktop has a bit of a problem when it comes to loading

</I>&gt;<i> Moonlight/Silverlight application is to add it to your AppManifest.xaml
</I>&gt;<i> file. When the application starts up, all assemblies referenced in the
</I>&gt;<i> AppManifest are loaded. If they are core assemblies like System.Windows,
</I>&gt;<i> they are loaded automatically by the plugin from the private 'gac' the
</I>&gt;<i> plugin has. If they're in the XAP file they are loaded from the directory
</I>&gt;<i> where the XAP was decompressed to and finally if they're ExternalParts
</I>&gt;<i> assemblies they are downloaded from a remote location to a temporary
</I>&gt;<i> directory and loaded from there. This way the assemblies are already loaded
</I>&gt;<i> and usable when you start parsing xaml so when the xaml parser sees types
</I>&gt;<i> like &quot;sdk:GridSplitter&quot; it already has the correct assembly loaded and can
</I>&gt;<i> find the correct type and instantiate it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The problem with moonlight-desktop is two-fold. First we never parse the
</I>&gt;<i> AppManifest.xaml file. Secondly even if we parse it to figure out what
</I>&gt;<i> assemblies we have to load, there is no xap containing the SDK assemblies so
</I>&gt;<i> we can't load them and end up throwing an AssemblyNotFound exception at
</I>&gt;<i> startup. This is because moonlight cannot load the assembly from the GAC
</I>&gt;<i> using just the name &quot;System.Windows.Controls.dll&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would it be possible for a desktop app to provide a list of AssemblyParts
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> moonlight?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, this is called AppManifest.xaml :) We can simplify the desktop case by
only using the AssemblyParts part of the regular web manifest when running
in desktop mode.


&gt;<i>  &gt; We have three possible solutions for this that I can think of.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) As there are a limited number of assemblies which can be accessed in
</I>&gt;<i> this way (just the 6 or so SDK assemblies), then we can potentially hardcode
</I>&gt;<i> in specific support for loading these from the GAC when they are detected in
</I>&gt;<i> a moonlight-desktop application.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hard-coding to a select few also won't help those who want to write thier
</I>&gt;<i> own
</I>&gt;<i> control libraries.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
True, if there was a control library installed in the regular GAC it would
experience the exact same issue as the SDK controls currently have. I was
thinking that in this case you'd just copy the built control library locally
and bundle it in your app, but as you say a bit later in your email, it
makes updates much harder. This would definitely be non-intuitive.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) Ask people to always copy SDK assemblies locally when compiling their
</I>&gt;<i> application. This is already what happens when you build a regular
</I>&gt;<i> silverlight/moonlight application.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) Bundle desktop applications as a regular xap file just like web
</I>&gt;<i> applications.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Don't much like this, like you say, it makes updates hard and distribution
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> little strange.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Some distros may not like the idea of applications bundling these SDK
</I>&gt;<i> assemblies so maybe providing a mechanism to load the SDK assemblies from
</I>&gt;<i> the GAC would be the best option. It would also make it easier to roll out
</I>&gt;<i> fixes to moonlight-desktop applications as if there was a bug in an SDK
</I>&gt;<i> assembly a simple update of that package would roll the fix out to every
</I>&gt;<i> desktop app using the assembly. If they all bundled the assemblies they
</I>&gt;<i> would have to be updated individually. This would make option 1 preferable.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does anyone have any preferences on how to fix or work around this issue?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was expecting tgat an xmlns include of the form of
</I>&gt;<i> 'clr-namespace:foo;assembly=foo.dll' to load foo.dll from the local program
</I>&gt;<i> directory or the gac when run as a desktop app (rather just the xap dir in
</I>&gt;<i> an
</I>&gt;<i> OOb app). Would it be possible to supply a callback to the xaml parser for
</I>&gt;<i> assembly resolution/loading?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I would ultimately like is for the desktop profile apps to not require
</I>&gt;<i> any
</I>&gt;<i> appmanifest at all, One of my programs is xamlpreviewer (basically xamlpad
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> mono). So I won't know all of the assemblies ahead of time.  Before your
</I>&gt;<i> patch
</I>&gt;<i> I could omit the appmanifest file altogether but just not use new xmlns
</I>&gt;<i> entries.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
In order to load an assembly from the GAC we need to know the full name of
the assembly, i.e. the name in the form &quot;System.Windows.Controls,
Version=2.0.5.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=0738eb9f132ed756&quot;. The xaml
used should be identical between web and desktop cases so the simplest
solution is probably to augment the AppManifest.xaml file to add an
additional entry which maps filename to assembly fullname. Something like:

&lt;Assembly FileName=&quot;System.Windows.Controls.dll&quot;
FullName=&quot;System.Windows.Controls, Version=2.0.5.0, Culture=neutral,
PublicKeyToken=0738eb9f132ed756&quot; /&gt;

Without that mapping it's not possible to load up arbitrary assemblies in
the desktop case. This is likely to be an issue if you're loading arbitrary
assemblies at runtime and trying to use types from those assemblies via
xaml. To do this the runtime will have to be informed of any new filename to
assembly mappings in the dynamically loaded assembly/xaml. I should look
into how WPF handles this kind of thing.

Alan.
