<PRE>A lot of you have been asking for an SDK to simplify development of
moonlight/silverlight applications using monodevelop over the last few
weeks and months and we've finally got a release ready! It's mostly
thanks to Andrew Jorgensen and I just finished off the last few things
over the last couple of weeks.

Right now the only distro with packages is opensuse 11.4. This is
purely because it is what I use myself and I could set it up pretty
easily. It's only a couple of clicks to generate opensuse 11.3
packages which I should get around to tomorrow. You'll also need a
MonoDevelop newer than 2.6 beta 2. As such, you'll need a trunk build
until beta 3 is released. All you have to do is install the newer
monodevelop and the various moonlight packages in my opensuse build
service project repository (install nothing else from it!) and you'll
be good to go. I'd appreciate any testing/feedback over the next
days/weeks to iron out any issues with both the SDK and MonoDevelop
integration so we can have a rock solid MonoDevelop 2.6 experience.
It'd also be great if packagers for other distros could start the ball
rolling to generate moonlight 4 packages and SDKs for their distros!

So the quick 5 step guide is:
1) Install MonoDevelop trunk (or build from git):
<A HREF="http://monodevelop.com/Download/Trunk_Builds">http://monodevelop.com/Download/Trunk_Builds</A>
2) Install moonlight-web-devel
<A HREF="http://software.opensuse.org/ymp/home:alan_mcgovern/openSUSE_11.4/moonlight-web-devel.ymp?base=openSUSE%3A11.4&amp;query=moonlight">http://software.opensuse.org/ymp/home:alan_mcgovern/openSUSE_11.4/moonlight-web-devel.ymp?base=openSUSE%3A11.4&amp;query=moonlight</A>
3) Launch the new monodevelop and create a moonlight project
4) Ensure it's targeting moonlight 4.0 in the project settings (this
may not yet be selected by default)
5) Hit F5 to build and run :)

Note: If installing moonlight-web-devel does not pull in the correct
moonlight dependencies, could you try installing the other moonlight
packages from the repository one by one until the issue is fixed. Then
let me know what one you needed :) I'll be running through this exact
set of instructions tomorrow with the new SDK in a new VM to ensure
everything is correct. For now, test and let me know if it's not!
