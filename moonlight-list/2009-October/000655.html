CoreCLR support, like the verifier, is inside Mono itself. Moonlight
only enables them when initializing Mono.

</I>
No (as per above). So you might want some other features from Moonlight
(e.g. web and socket policies) but this is not required to get either
CoreCLR or the verifier working.

&gt;<i> Embed Mono as we currently do and then use the CoreCLR machinery to
</I>&gt;<i> build our own Sandbox?
</I>
Yes. Now that requires you to provide class libraries that follow the
CoreCLR requirements. 

There are quite a few pages on the wiki about the security tools we're
using to _ease_ that job - but keep in mind that our job is a bit
simpler because we already have a profile, Silverlight 2, to use as a
guideline. 

You'll likely need/want something different since I assume you'll want
to keep, as much as possible, compatible with your existing class
libraries.

&gt;<i> We're hoping to use Moonlight 2 final for this work, what's the
</I>&gt;<i> current estimated release date for that?
</I>
The current state (in mono 2.6 branch) is very stable and unlikely to
change much API-wise. I suggest you start with this then build your own
class libraries (profile) with the coreclr requirements - that later
part (and its audit) will likely take some time (and Moonlight 2.0 will
likely have shipped by then).
