<PRE>In the #moonlight IRC channel, lewing asked for a sample app that demonstrates the performance problems under Moonlight when you have a high number of UIElements on the page (such as UpdateLayout being called thousands of times while the mouse is moving). Here is a link to a self-contained sample that demonstrates the problem:

<A HREF="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/481204/MoonlightGridSample.zip">http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/481204/MoonlightGridSample.zip</A>

Just open the file called called TestPage.html. Moving the mouse around over the grid shows part of the problem (it is glassy smooth on Windows and OS X with Microsoft Silverlight), and it is even more pronounced when you grab the vertical scrollbar thumb and drag it. Scrolling the grid can take several seconds, sometimes more than 10 seconds.

All source is included in the .zip.
