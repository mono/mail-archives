<PRE>As of r136729 more of the metadata verifier has been enabled. Now it's table
data verification.

I'm sorry to inform you, but this is the part where bugs will get nasty.
With the IL verifier, in case of a bug you get a nice exception which makes
tracking it down pretty easier.
But now, in case of a bug, you should get an exception, but it's quite
likely that a runtime crash can also happen.

This is because the runtime has not received proper hardening and, as such,
it doesn't handle well broken assemblies.

Anyway, in case you find a bug, just send me the URL of the page/xap as this
is usually enough.

I would like to see this code shipped with next week preview.

The next step is to enable signature checking, which should land trunk this
week as well, but I'm ok with skipping it
only the week after.

Cheers,
Rodrigo
