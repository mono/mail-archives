&#65279;That would be wrong, but you're right that icalls are a bit special.
The main point is detect-sc cannot generalize them, like p/invokes can
be.

&gt;<i> for example, the constructor of System.Net.Sockets.Socket calls the 
</I>&gt;<i> Socket_internal() icall, but has no security attribute.
</I>
Here a counter-example (Math.cs) why:

[MethodImplAttribute (MethodImplOptions.InternalCall)]
public extern static double Floor (double d);

if icalls were SC then Math.Floor (and a bunch of others icalls) would
not be usable from application (user) code and this would break
compatibility with MS SL2.

Now in your case you got:

[MethodImplAttribute(MethodImplOptions.InternalCall)]
private extern IntPtr Socket_internal(AddressFamily family,
      SocketType type,
      ProtocolType proto,
      out int error);

which cannot be not called outside the class itself - so it is already
off-limit to most transparent code. Using reflection to Invoke private
code is also not possible in this case under the coreclr (see r136547
for an explict test case).

&gt;<i> (In Silverlight, not the method, but the entire Socket class has been 
</I>&gt;<i> marked [SecuritySafeCritical])
</I>
In general compatibility with [SecuritySafeCriticial] attributes is not
important. The reasons are documented on the wiki.

&gt;<i> Am I missing something here?
</I>
Maybe ;-) It's important to understand that:

        1) the tools are not perfect and won't ever be. That's why we
        need the .manual files along them (even if I have some plans to
        make the tools better, e.g. reducing the number of SSC);

        2) Running them does NOT give you secure assemblies (and that's
        not even near their goal). What it does is telling you what's
        need to be *safe* in order for coreclr to work properly. Making
        them safe is one of the required tasks to get a secure execution
        environment.

Back to icalls. They need to be audited separately, well differently,
from the SSC because of their relationship with the runtime (basically
it's not managed code). 

However I see your point (it's confusing) and I'm thinking about
something that would solve another open issue (from SRE point of view).

        a) make all* icalls decorated with [SecuritySafeCritical]. Note
        that this is not a really a change since this is how they work
        right now - but that would make it less confusing and would
        allow (b);
        
        b) change the runtime to treat icall like pinvoke (under
        coreclr);
        
That should make it impossible to create a icall definition that can be
mapped to the runtime (since it would come from transparent code, where
the security attributes are ignored).

Sebastien

* &#65279;&#65279;better yet to make [SSC] the visibile ones and [SC] the internal
ones but that might need to wait for the tool refactoring (got some more
ideas for them, including avoiding a second build when adding SC)
