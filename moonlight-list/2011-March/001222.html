<PRE>OK, great. I'll describe my performance problem in more specific terms 
and perhaps someone will be able to give me some hints.

I have a Canvas that contains the following children:

  - 20 bitmaps
  - five Path objects
  - one of the Path objects has 1500 PathFigure objects

When the user presses the left mouse button and moves the mouse I scroll 
the canvas children. I do this by iterating over the children and then:

Item.SetValue(Canvas.LeftProperty, NewLeft);
Item.SetValue(Canvas.TopProperty, NewTop);

This works great in Windows - the scrolling is smooth and responsive. 
This is awful and almost unusable in Linux with Moonlight 3.99.0.1.

I turned on GPU acceleration and set the CacheMode of the Canvas to 
BitmapCache. This significantly hurts the performance in Windows.

So, here are some questions:

1. Will the forthcoming GPU acceleration in Moonlight help my situation 
or is it only for 3D and textures? It made things worse under Windows.

2. Any hints on how I can improve performance for scrolling Canvas children?

3. Am I wasting my time with this? I feel like I am spending 80% of my 
effort chasing a small number of Linux users. I really would like my 
application to work well for everyone, but there is a limit on how much 
time I can spend on it.

4. Does Moonlight have issues with specific graphics cards or drivers?

Note that I tested with 50,000 PathFigure objects on the canvas under 
Windows and it still works great with smooth and responsive scrolling. 
So I don't think that 1,500 is excessive or unreasonable.

Any help to bring my application to Linux users is *greatly* appreciated.
