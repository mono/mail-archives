<PRE>        I'm a bit confused by the phrase &quot;you need to be using Mono from 
git master&quot;.. if you update the the proper versions (git reset --hard 
&lt;CURRENT REQUIRED MONOREVISION&gt;) , shouldn't you already be &quot;using&quot; the 
correct mono version? It seems as though the build system actually calls 
out to the installed mono compiler (which for current ubuntu is still 
2.6.7)
        I've been hitting similar issues for several months (no successful 
builds from git since December)... From what I've deduced so far, the 
problem is that the build system isn't properly bootstrapping such that 
when it's building it doesn't use the mono version that it builds to do 
the actual compile, but instead is using the system (/usr) version (which 
of course doesn't work). I tend to get errors from mcs about switches that 
didn't exist, etc. I've always been using parallel systems (trying to 
build moonlight with --prefix=/opt/mono).
        Anyway, I'm in the process of installing a new VM with stock 10.10 
ubuntu (for about the 5th time) to make sure there's nothing messed up on 
my system, but I'm confused as to how more people aren't hitting issues 
(unless everyone installs into /usr and doesn't actually use parallel 
installs)... The other thing that would be super helpful would be a list 
of exactly what needs to be installed on top of a stock system to actually 
build mono/moonlight -- Given that I've set up these systems a bunch of 
times now, I have my own list (below, but includes a a bunch of extra 
things that I found myself wanting that weren't strictly required), but it 
seems like this should be on the compiling mono page...

Here's what I've got so far (and I'm sure I've forgotten to add some) -- 
this is a seriously long list which is why it seems like it needs to be 
documented on the howto page:

Ah, that's the problem... you need to be using Mono from git master (aka
2.11). You need the exact revision listed in the README file.
