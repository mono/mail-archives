<PRE>Hey,

 So I was checking out this issue in a little more detail today and I have a
good idea what's supposed to be happening (I think ;) ).

public static DependencyProperty Whatever = DependencyProperty.Register
(&quot;Name&quot;, typeof (IComparable)..... );

If i assign the double value '5.0' to this property and apply a storyboard
with &quot;new DoubleAnimation { By = 10 }&quot; to it, I end up with the value of 15.
If i assign another class/struct which is IComparable but not a double, we
end up with a value of '10' for the same animation (test in svn for this).

So what this tells me is that we shouldn't box value types when pushing them
to native. Native needs to recognise a double as a double, no matter what.
The current way of type checking by using 'kind' won't work for this case.
What native needs to use instead is the clr method Type.IsAssignableFrom or
some equivalent. This would then allow us to dump the current
'box_value_type' code which hacks around another facet of this issue.

Of course, there's probably something I haven't thought of which makes this
wrong, but I figured that since I'm going away for the weekend I should
mention it anyway ;)

Alan.
