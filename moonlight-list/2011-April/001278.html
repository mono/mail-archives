<PRE>Hello,

A new detect.exe tool has replaced the detect-sc.exe, detect-ssc.exe and
merge.exe tools. If that does not mean anything to you then don't worry
this change should be meaningless too ;-)

Pro
        * there's no need to execute 'make detect' (and re-build)
        anymore when adding/modifying critical code (like new pinvokes);
        
        * it's more likely to work if you're not using the &quot;right&quot; mono
        revision (or have some local changes in there) but that won't
        help if there were manual override changes, i.e. stick to the
        README :-)
        
Cons
        * it takes a bit more time to build since everything needs to be
        re-computed each time [1];
        
        * the removal of the automatic/*.auto.s[s] files makes the
        process is a bit more opaque when something breaks [2]


Sebastien

p.s. moon-unit is happy and I'll be monitoring the bots over the weekend


[1] the build was changed (quite a few times actually ;-) to avoid
'tuning' several times (two 'make tuning' for the circular dependency of
SW/SWB + install + extra moon assemblies) so the extra time is not
really visible (and you should save a few extra, make detect-required
builds too)

[2] You can, at build-time, get more details by running 'detect'
manually using the --a (annotations) option [3]. This will produce
commented *.secattr files, so you'll know (in even more details that
before) why some types/methods got their security attributes. Also you
can still set the &quot;MONO_LOG_LEVEL=warning MONO_LOG_MASK=security&quot;
environment variables to find CoreCLR issues at runtime.

[3] To help debugging the change the --a option is enabled at the moment
(but will likely not stay for default builds)

</PRE>
