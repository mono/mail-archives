<PRE>I made a few changes, mostly to isolate the Silverlight 2.0 stuff that's in
the source tree now from the 1.0 stuff.  As it stands at the moment, there
should be zero 2.0 specific code/types/anything included in the 1.0 build.
This means both managed and unmanaged.  Before we built all the 2.0 stuff
and just left out the hooks to run 2.0 content in the 1.0 build.  But
there's no point in including additional code that's never going to run in a
released 1.0 (nor is there a reason to waste time compiling the files at all
in a 1.0 environment.)

Keeping the managed side segregated is easy: We don't build any of it if 2.0
isn't enabled.  The unmanaged side isn't as easy though, so here's some
conventions I've implemented:


   1. All 2.0 specific classes/methods/files/blocks of code/etc are wrapped
   in #if INCLUDE_MONO_RUNTIME.  This was mostly partially done before.
   2. All 2.0 specific dependencyobject descendants need a special typegen
   pragma of the form:  /* @SilverlightVersion=&quot;2&quot; */ on the line above the
   class declaration in their header files.  If you grep for this string you'll
   find a number of examples.  This enables the typegen machinery to wrap the
   generated code (and enum values) for these types in the proper #if
   INCLUDE_MONO_RUNTIME.
   3. Files that are 2.0 specific are listed in a special block in
   src/Makefile.am, so they aren't compiled at all.  Examples include grid.cpp,
   xap.cpp, deployment.cpp.

The reason 2 is still needed even with 3 above is that typegen isn't smart
enough (and it would be a pain to make it smart enough) to deal with 1.0 vs
2.0 files, and some files (control.h) have both 1.0 and 2.0 classes in the
same file.

I'm planning to go through and replace INCLUDE_MONO_RUNTIME with a better
ifdef.  There are a couple of possibilities:

   1. SILVERLIGHT_VERSION, which we can use in comparisons, like &quot;#if
   SILVERLIGHT_VERSION &gt;= 2&quot;
   2. a scheme more like mcs/ uses, where we'll define SILVERLIGHT_2 in 2.0
   builds, SILVERLIGHT_2 and SILVERLIGHT_3 in 3.0 builds, etc.

Anyone have an opinion on which one to use?
