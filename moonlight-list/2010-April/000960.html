<PRE>
Hi All,


I'm 5th year Computer Science student from Gdansk, Poland. I want to
introduce myself and describe my ideas about Silverlight/Web-based video
editing software (form <A HREF="http://mono-project.com/StudentProjects">http://mono-project.com/StudentProjects</A>).
I would like to participate Google Summer of Code this year and create some
usable video montage tool. About 3 years ago I have focused on .NET
platform. I'm interesting
in video montage and movie making. I have worked with montage in Adobe
Premiere, Adobe Audition and Sony Vegas. Also I create sometimes animations
for my movies in Adobe After Effects.


ABSTRACT

I will develop simple and intuitive web-based video montage environment.
During this project I would like to implement the most
important features typically required by users who want to montage movies
using Internet. Beside I would like to include in this
project my idea of distributing media resources in distracted montage
environment (such as Internet). In short my idea is:

Use automatic compression mechanism to make preview files (considerable
smaller than original ones) for all media files on server (for example
builds by FFMpeg libraries).
Add some metadata to media files (about characters, actors, requisites,
weather in record, time of day in record) in XML files.
Distribute media resources in two versions of file: compressed (preview) one
(for searching media resources by prepared metadata) and original (source)
file (for rendering).
Streaming media from server




This is schema of this idea. User could streaming compressed media from
server or download it from server or another user. 




<A HREF="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/681495/Schema_011.png">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/681495/Schema_011.png</A> 




Of course it isn't the basic functionality of project, but I hope it could
optimize sharing media resources between users. I'm aware it's problem to
manage files
on local machine from Silverlight web application. I have worked out some
apps in .NET connected with media and will do some research on this case
before staring project.


FUNCTIONAL SUMMARY


After think over this case I decided to expose some parts of video editor. I
would like to realize this parts of application as
separated controls. Below I describe basic use cases for my project idea.
The User is a person who want to montage video by Internet using
my Silverlight UI.

Legend:


Project treeview
load media files into project - thirls media resource(s) to project and put
it into project treeview
manipulate project items - move media item in treeview, rename and delete
items


Built-in player
play selected media - play media resource selected on project treeview
play project - play media which are montage in timeline editor
pause playing - stops playing media
stop playing - interrupt playing media and go to it's begin


Trimmer 
select region - choose part of source clip
preview play media - show in player media file or it's selected region form
trimmer
put region into timeline editor - drag&amp;drop selected region from trimmer and
put it into particular channel


Timeline editor
manipulate media items - move clips forward and backward in timeline, cut,
delete, split and marge them
manipulate channels - changing channels sequence order, set name and
description to channel
manipulate channel properties - set volume (for audio) and opacity (for
video)
put media into timeline editor - drag&amp;drop media item from project treeview
to timeline editor
set marker - put marker in timeline and name it


Project manager
create new project - create empty project with particular properties
open existing project - load project from file on hard drive or download it
form server
set project properties - define default setting of project - such as video
format, author, workspace for media resources
save project template - save project template into file or upload it to
server
save project - save project into file or upload it to server


Media manager
show media details - show parameters of media file as bitrate, total time,
type of container, type of codec
download source media - downloading original media from server to local
workspace
download preview media - downloading compressed copy of original file form
server to local workspace
upload media - uploading compressed version of local media to server
set autocompression properties - automatic compressor settings
add tag to media - match tag(s) with single media
search by tags - return list of media files on server which are described
required tags


Rendering tool
set rendering properties - define settings for rendering the project into
single file
save rendering template - save rendering settings into file or upload it to
server
render project - converts whole project form timeline editor into single
file


IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

Here is the moment I want show a preview of user interface I would like to
create.

Project manager

Part of application to manage multiple projects and project templates.


wizard for create new projects

specify video template (e.g. PAL, NTSC, HDV), fps, video frame size and
pixel aspect ratio for all video channels
define sample rate and default volume for all audio channels


describe project: title, author, tags
save project setting as template for future projects
save/load project (on hard drive or on server, to XML file)


Project treeview

The control which visualize project resources and deliver some manage them.


show project media resources
mark already used resources (which had been on timeline editor)


Media manager

Module providing exchange media between Silverlight video editor and media
server.


define workspace for project media resources
add some metadata describing files as tags (save in XML files)
show details about media file as
replace on the fly used preview file (compressed) by its original version
(for example download it from server)


Built-in player 

Simple media player control.


play from start of file
play from selected point
play from nearest marker
stop
pause
time scroll
change volume


Trimmer

Tool for preview and treatment single media resource before putting into
montage.


load media file
play media
select region and place it in timeline editor
choose start point and play media form it
shows total time of media and current time


Timeline editor

Main element of application, contains channels (alternatively dedicated for
viedo or audio media). On channels we can arrange our media and build art
work:).


multiple channels (few types: video, audio, subtitles (optional))
add, delete channel
name channels
master settings for each channel (volume, opacity)
frame representation of video clip
select items, move, split, delete
select multiple items
set markers
set fade in or fade out to items


Rendering tool

Module for compression project into single media file.


choose container format (avi, mpeg2, mp4, wav, ogg)
choose compression method (uncompressed, dv, XviD, mp3)
save rendering settings as template
specify rendered file output directory


SCHEDULE
Here I want describe my working plan forecast. I assume I will have more
time after June and I would like implement most important features on July
and August.




Second half of May I will do some research about ffmpeg libraries and
Silverlight. I will build some prototype of app and try to manage media in
it.






First two weeks of June I will spend to implementing functionality to
maintaining project and media resources.

include some create new project wizard and mechanism to serializing it
load media into project
download media from url
manage project media resources by project treeview







Second part of work (second half of June) simple timeline editor control
will be build. 

the most important features are adding new channel to project
implement dropping items from project treeview into created channels
I will also enable manipulation to items such as moving it, cutting,
splitting, deleting, merging







After June I will have some more time and want to implement features faster.
Third I would like to implement trimmer control (as separated single media
channel) and player.

enables selection regions of single media file (video or audio)
putting media into timeline editor channel.
implement also player control for watching clips

playing clips from trimmer and project treeview
stopping and pausing played media
scrolling media content and set playing volume


During this stage app should works with it's basics.






In Fourth stage (about second half of July) I will focus on rendering cases.

enable playing project in built-in player from timeline editor channels
implement simple rendering
manage rendering settings such as choose container and codec type
save/load setting template on hard drive or on server







I want to spend fifth (between 1 and 16 August) part of my work for
implementing media manager features

adding tags to media
searching media by tags - simple media search engine
automatic media compression into preview files
replacing preview files by source files from server and render project

Apart form it I will do some improvements to timeline editor and rendering
tool.






After 9 August I will focus on fixing bugs and do some improvements.





AUTHOR

Some detailed information about me

I'm fifth year Computer Science student at Faculty of Electronics,
Telecommunications and Informatics (Specialization: Modeling and Programming
Informatics Systems at Department of Algorithms and System Modeling) and
second year student of Management at Faculty of Management and Economics
(both studies at Gdansk University of Technology, Poland). I have
participated two times in Microsoft Imagine Cup: in 2009 (player and editing
application for interactive movies - C#, WPF, DirectShow) and in 2010
(strategy simulating charity organization - C#, Silverlight 3, NHibernate,
SQLite). Apart form informatics and programming I'm interesting in video
montage, computer graphics and animations. I try to match my Computer
Science studies and movie making hobby in my final work at Informatics
Faculty. It's connected with media distribution (and media data mining) in
distracted team work on media projects like movies, animations, video and
audio commercials, music etc.



My mind is open for any suggestions, advice and criticism :). If anyone have
ideas about my concept I will be very pleased for comments.

Best regards,
Adam Walkowski
