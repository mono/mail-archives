<PRE>Hello everyone!

I'm facing problems with certain third-party controls. When I put them in a
simple view to run them in the browser everything is smooth, but if I add
them to a 'desktop-view' they doesn't appear. The stack trace says the
parser is not able to load and retrieve some resources (themes, mainly). The
application anyway works without showing those controls.
I suspect the issue derives with the used parser but switching from managed
to native with environment variables make 'explode' the application.

Do you have any idea about what I can try to use the same parser of the
browser plugin or to resolve these problems?
Maybe something went wrong during the compilation of Moonlight?

The plugin was being installed from the Moonlight site, and the
'moonlight-desktop' framework has been compiled from git with curl and cairo
flags setted to system.


Thank you for any help,
Mat.
