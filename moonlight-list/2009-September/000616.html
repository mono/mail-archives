&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately I've found a major issue with out shutdown design, which
</I>&gt;<i> loosely goes like this
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) firefox notifies us that the plugin has been removed from the page
</I>&gt;<i> 2) we do managed cleanup: (Deployment::Dispose () is called) which calls
</I>&gt;<i> mono_domain_finalize (which will finalize every single object in that
</I>&gt;<i> appdomain)
</I>&gt;<i> 3) we do native cleanup: we wait until the managed objects have freed their
</I>&gt;<i> native refs, which will cause a cascading effect of native objects
</I>&gt;<i> unreffing
</I>&gt;<i> other native objects.
</I>&gt;<i> 4) the last object alive is the Deployment instance, and in
</I>&gt;<i> Deployment::~Deployment  we call mono_domain_unload (which will abort all
</I>&gt;<i> managed threads)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is in 2): mono_domain_finalize assumes all threads running in
</I>&gt;<i> the domain have already been aborted. Since that's not done until 4), a lot
</I>&gt;<i> of weird things happen in those threads (mostly crashes of course, but also
</I>&gt;<i> weirds NREs).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason we can't call mono_domain_unload in 2) (and skip 4) completely),
</I>&gt;<i> is that we might end up invoking managed delegates in 3), which would crash
</I>&gt;<i> too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm able to reproduce these issues with <A HREF="http://hdbeta.ctv.ca/">http://hdbeta.ctv.ca/</A> 99% of the
</I>&gt;<i> time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can think of 2 solutions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a) Somehow guarantee that we won't call into managed code in 3), and call
</I>&gt;<i> mono_domain_unload in 2) instead of mono_domain_finalize. Possibly by
</I>&gt;<i> having
</I>&gt;<i> a 'shutting_down' flag on the Deployment instance that can be checked
</I>&gt;<i> before
</I>&gt;<i> calling function pointers (event emitting being the biggest I think, but
</I>&gt;<i> there are quite a few others too). Or maybe add managed finalizers to clear
</I>&gt;<i> out the native function pointer (this may have threading issues though
</I>&gt;<i> since
</I>&gt;<i> finalizers aren't run on the main thread).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> b) Expose a method in the mono runtime that aborts all the managed threads,
</I>&gt;<i> and do that just before calling mono_domain_finalize. However I have a
</I>&gt;<i> feeling that the runtime folks won't think this is a good idea ;-) To me it
</I>&gt;<i> feels like a dirty hack, especially since we'd basically duplicate
</I>&gt;<i> mono_domain_unload.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, domain unload is a very very tricky subject, so I think option (a) is
the way to go.

I think it would be a matter of pushing all unmanaged cleanup to happen
during domain
unload. I suppose the whole problem is that mono_domain_unload is
asynchronous.

We could extend the runtime interface to enable it do be done synchronous or
give back a
native event object that will be pulsed when done - so batch parallel unload
is possible. If
that's not enough and there is a clear point during unload that ML needs a
hook for, we
could add one too.
