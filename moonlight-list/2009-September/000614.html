<PRE>Hi,

I've setup moonbuilder to build release builds (as well as one normal debug
build and one debug build with all extra options (logging, object tracking,
sanity checks) on) here: 

<A HREF="http://moon.sublimeintervention.com/index.aspx?lane=moon-trunk-2.0-xpi">http://moon.sublimeintervention.com/index.aspx?lane=moon-trunk-2.0-xpi</A>

As the name of the lane implies, xpis are also built.

However the release builds are failing to build, due to:

	dependencyproperty.g.cpp: In member function 'virtual void
Deployment::SetSurface(Surface*)':
	dependencyproperty.g.cpp:4159: error: no matching function for call
to 'Value::CreateUnrefPtr(Surface*&amp;)'
	value.h:367: note: candidates are: static Value*
Value::CreateUnrefPtr(EventObject*)


This is also the first step into distributing tests for the same revision
over several bots (which could speed up getting results for the latest
check-in quite much), in which case the buildbot flow would be something
like this:
- first moonlight is built in one lane (the one created above), the
installed directory is zipped up and pushed to the server
- each testing bot downloads the zip and starts testing, here we could for
instance split our testing in 4 (since we have currently have 4 bots for
each arch):
  - ms tests priority 0
  - ms tests priority 1
  - ms tests other priorities
  - our own tests
Supposing that all bots are waiting for work when a check-in is made, the
total time for all tests would be &quot;build time + MAX (test time for each test
lane)&quot;. The exact tests run in each test lane would be tweaked so that
duration of each test lanes would roughly equal. 

Having in mind that the # of tests we have will only go up, I think this
would help us quite much.

Rolf
