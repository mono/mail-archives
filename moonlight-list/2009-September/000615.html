<PRE>Hi,

Unfortunately I've found a major issue with out shutdown design, which
loosely goes like this

1) firefox notifies us that the plugin has been removed from the page
2) we do managed cleanup: (Deployment::Dispose () is called) which calls
mono_domain_finalize (which will finalize every single object in that
appdomain)
3) we do native cleanup: we wait until the managed objects have freed their
native refs, which will cause a cascading effect of native objects unreffing
other native objects.
4) the last object alive is the Deployment instance, and in
Deployment::~Deployment  we call mono_domain_unload (which will abort all
managed threads)

The problem is in 2): mono_domain_finalize assumes all threads running in
the domain have already been aborted. Since that's not done until 4), a lot
of weird things happen in those threads (mostly crashes of course, but also
weirds NREs).

The reason we can't call mono_domain_unload in 2) (and skip 4) completely),
is that we might end up invoking managed delegates in 3), which would crash
too.

I'm able to reproduce these issues with <A HREF="http://hdbeta.ctv.ca/">http://hdbeta.ctv.ca/</A> 99% of the
time.

I can think of 2 solutions:

a) Somehow guarantee that we won't call into managed code in 3), and call
mono_domain_unload in 2) instead of mono_domain_finalize. Possibly by having
a 'shutting_down' flag on the Deployment instance that can be checked before
calling function pointers (event emitting being the biggest I think, but
there are quite a few others too). Or maybe add managed finalizers to clear
out the native function pointer (this may have threading issues though since
finalizers aren't run on the main thread).

b) Expose a method in the mono runtime that aborts all the managed threads,
and do that just before calling mono_domain_finalize. However I have a
feeling that the runtime folks won't think this is a good idea ;-) To me it
feels like a dirty hack, especially since we'd basically duplicate
mono_domain_unload.

Any other ideas?

Rolf
