<PRE>Hi,
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Unfortunately I've found a major issue with our shutdown design, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>loosely goes like this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>1) firefox notifies us that the plugin has been removed from the page
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>2) we do managed cleanup: (Deployment::Dispose () is called) which calls
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>mono_domain_finalize (which will finalize every single object in that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>appdomain)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>3) we do native cleanup: we wait until the managed objects have freed
</I>their
&gt;&gt;<i>native refs, which will cause a cascading effect of native objects
</I>unreffing
&gt;&gt;<i>other native objects.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>4) the last object alive is the Deployment instance, and in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Deployment::~Deployment &#160;we call mono_domain_unload (which will abort all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>managed threads)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>The problem is in 2): mono_domain_finalize assumes all threads running in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the domain have already been aborted. Since that's not done until 4), a
</I>lot
&gt;&gt;<i>of weird things happen in those threads (mostly crashes of course, but
</I>also
&gt;&gt;<i>weirds NREs).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>The reason we can't call mono_domain_unload in 2) (and skip 4)
</I>completely),
&gt;&gt;<i>is that we might end up invoking managed delegates in 3), which would
</I>crash
&gt;&gt;<i>too.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I'm able to reproduce these issues with <A HREF="http://hdbeta.ctv.ca/">http://hdbeta.ctv.ca/</A> 99% of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I can think of 2 solutions:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>a) Somehow guarantee that we won't call into managed code in 3), and call
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>mono_domain_unload in 2) instead of mono_domain_finalize. Possibly by
</I>having
&gt;&gt;<i>a 'shutting_down' flag on the Deployment instance that can be checked
</I>before
&gt;&gt;<i>calling function pointers (event emitting being the biggest I think, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>there are quite a few others too). Or maybe add managed finalizers to
</I>clear
&gt;&gt;<i>out the native function pointer (this may have threading issues though
</I>since
&gt;&gt;<i>finalizers aren't run on the main thread).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Hi,
</I>
I've just had a better (though more complicated) idea, splitting the
shutdown into several well-defined parts:

0) during execution we maintain a list of managed objects which has function
pointers in native code that can get called during native shutdown [0]

1) firefox notifies us that the plugin has been removed from the page
(Deployment::Dispose () is called on the plugins Deployment instance)

2) We ensure that our media thread pool does not execute anything for this
deployment anymore (if necessary waiting/polling while currently executing
work is finishing up)
 
3) We call mono_domain_unload, registering a callback to call when all the
mono threads have been aborted [1]

4) Our callback is called, and we iterate the managed objects from the list
in 0) asking them to nullify the managed function pointer native code has.
[2] [3]

5) At this point we can guarantee that no more managed code will be
executed, and we can return from the callback

6) We call mono_domain_free [4] and proceed with the native shutdown.

Pros:
* it solves any threading issues since we make sure that we don't do much
until we're only executing on the main thread.
* there is no polling required to check if it's safe to call a function
pointer or not

Cons:
* requires mono runtime changes
* not sure if I'm over-complicating things given that I've only found 1 case
I'm sure this is an issue [0]. 


[0] I've isolated these cases of managed callbacks in native code:
* ExternalDemuxer: definitively might call back into managed code during
native cleanup.
* EventObject has a DestroyedEvent that managed code could attach to: not
sure about this one (I quick grep didn't find anything in managed code).
* Downloaders (and related managed BrowserHttp* classes): Pretty sure this
is safe, since we abort all downloaders in Deployment::Dispose.
* DispatcherTimer: the clock should have stopped, so it should be safe.
* UI events (mouse, rendering events): the Surface should be zombified, so
nothing should happen here. The clock should be stopped too.
* Other events from EventObject (and derived classes): the clock should have
stopped, so I can't see how it could happen.
* Xaml parsing/loading: I don't think this can happen during shutdown in the
first place.
* Others?

[1] The idea is to ensure that no more user code is executed anymore, so it
would be called after the domain jobs have been cleared, but before
mono_domain_finalize is called in appdomain.c:unload_thread_main. It also
requires making mono_domain_unload async. One possible way would be to have
the equivalent of this API:

MonoUnloadData *mono_domain_unload_begin (MonoDomain *domain, callback
*callback); // does everything in mono_domain_unload up to where it waits
for the unload thread
void mono_domain_unload_end (MonoUnloadData *data); // does the rest of
mono_domain_unload, including waiting for the unload thread.


[2] I'm assuming that it's still legal to execute managed code at this point
(though we'd obviously have to make sure that we only execute code we can
control, not user code).

[3] This callback can be called from a different thread, it's trivial to
marshal the logic in 4) to the main thread and wait until that code has
executed.

[4] We're not calling mono_domain_free right now, not sure why since I'd
assume we'd leak otherwise.
 

&gt;&gt;<i>2) we do managed cleanup: (Deployment::Dispose () is called) which calls
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>mono_domain_finalize (which will finalize every single object in that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>appdomain)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>3) we do native cleanup: we wait until the managed objects have freed
</I>their
&gt;&gt;<i>native refs, which will cause a cascading effect of native objects
</I>unreffing
&gt;&gt;<i>other native objects.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>4) the last object alive is the Deployment instance, and in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Deployment::~Deployment  we call mono_domain_unload (which will abort all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>managed threads)
</I>

&gt;&gt;<i>b) Expose a method in the mono runtime that aborts all the managed
</I>threads,
&gt;&gt;<i>and do that just before calling mono_domain_finalize. However I have a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>feeling that the runtime folks won't think this is a good idea ;-) To me
</I>it
&gt;&gt;<i>feels like a dirty hack, especially since we'd basically duplicate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>mono_domain_unload.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Yes, domain unload is a very very tricky subject, so I think option (a) is
</I>the way to go.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think it would be a matter of pushing all unmanaged cleanup to happen
</I>during domain
&gt;<i>unload. I suppose the whole problem is that mono_domain_unload is
</I>asynchronous. 
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>We could extend the runtime interface to enable it to be done synchronous
</I>or give back a
&gt;<i>native event object that will be pulsed when done - so batch parallel
</I>unload is possible. If
&gt;<i>that's not enough and there is a clear point during unload that ML needs a
</I>hook for, we
&gt;<i>could add one too.
</I>
