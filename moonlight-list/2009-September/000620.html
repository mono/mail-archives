<PRE>Rolf,

The runtime is not very embedders friendly when it comes to shutdown. The
logging profiller
has issues on this since ever, I posted a patch on MDL that added a hook to
shutdown but it
died out of no reviewer to look at it.

I suggest you take this to MDL and discuss with Zoltan and Paolo.

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Unfortunately I've found a major issue with our shutdown design, which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;loosely goes like this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;1) firefox notifies us that the plugin has been removed from the page
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;2) we do managed cleanup: (Deployment::Dispose () is called) which calls
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;mono_domain_finalize (which will finalize every single object in that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;appdomain)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;3) we do native cleanup: we wait until the managed objects have freed
</I>&gt;<i> their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;native refs, which will cause a cascading effect of native objects
</I>&gt;<i> unreffing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;other native objects.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;4) the last object alive is the Deployment instance, and in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Deployment::~Deployment  we call mono_domain_unload (which will abort all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;managed threads)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;The problem is in 2): mono_domain_finalize assumes all threads running in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;the domain have already been aborted. Since that's not done until 4), a
</I>&gt;<i> lot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;of weird things happen in those threads (mostly crashes of course, but
</I>&gt;<i> also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;weirds NREs).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;The reason we can't call mono_domain_unload in 2) (and skip 4)
</I>&gt;<i> completely),
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;is that we might end up invoking managed delegates in 3), which would
</I>&gt;<i> crash
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;too.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;I'm able to reproduce these issues with <A HREF="http://hdbeta.ctv.ca/">http://hdbeta.ctv.ca/</A> 99% of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;I can think of 2 solutions:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;a) Somehow guarantee that we won't call into managed code in 3), and call
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;mono_domain_unload in 2) instead of mono_domain_finalize. Possibly by
</I>&gt;<i> having
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;a 'shutting_down' flag on the Deployment instance that can be checked
</I>&gt;<i> before
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;calling function pointers (event emitting being the biggest I think, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;there are quite a few others too). Or maybe add managed finalizers to
</I>&gt;<i> clear
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;out the native function pointer (this may have threading issues though
</I>&gt;<i> since
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;finalizers aren't run on the main thread).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've just had a better (though more complicated) idea, splitting the
</I>&gt;<i> shutdown into several well-defined parts:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 0) during execution we maintain a list of managed objects which has
</I>&gt;<i> function
</I>&gt;<i> pointers in native code that can get called during native shutdown [0]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) firefox notifies us that the plugin has been removed from the page
</I>&gt;<i> (Deployment::Dispose () is called on the plugins Deployment instance)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) We ensure that our media thread pool does not execute anything for this
</I>&gt;<i> deployment anymore (if necessary waiting/polling while currently executing
</I>&gt;<i> work is finishing up)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) We call mono_domain_unload, registering a callback to call when all the
</I>&gt;<i> mono threads have been aborted [1]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Our callback is called, and we iterate the managed objects from the list
</I>&gt;<i> in 0) asking them to nullify the managed function pointer native code has.
</I>&gt;<i> [2] [3]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5) At this point we can guarantee that no more managed code will be
</I>&gt;<i> executed, and we can return from the callback
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 6) We call mono_domain_free [4] and proceed with the native shutdown.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pros:
</I>&gt;<i> * it solves any threading issues since we make sure that we don't do much
</I>&gt;<i> until we're only executing on the main thread.
</I>&gt;<i> * there is no polling required to check if it's safe to call a function
</I>&gt;<i> pointer or not
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cons:
</I>&gt;<i> * requires mono runtime changes
</I>&gt;<i> * not sure if I'm over-complicating things given that I've only found 1
</I>&gt;<i> case
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure this is an issue [0].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [0] I've isolated these cases of managed callbacks in native code:
</I>&gt;<i> * ExternalDemuxer: definitively might call back into managed code during
</I>&gt;<i> native cleanup.
</I>&gt;<i> * EventObject has a DestroyedEvent that managed code could attach to: not
</I>&gt;<i> sure about this one (I quick grep didn't find anything in managed code).
</I>&gt;<i> * Downloaders (and related managed BrowserHttp* classes): Pretty sure this
</I>&gt;<i> is safe, since we abort all downloaders in Deployment::Dispose.
</I>&gt;<i> * DispatcherTimer: the clock should have stopped, so it should be safe.
</I>&gt;<i> * UI events (mouse, rendering events): the Surface should be zombified, so
</I>&gt;<i> nothing should happen here. The clock should be stopped too.
</I>&gt;<i> * Other events from EventObject (and derived classes): the clock should
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> stopped, so I can't see how it could happen.
</I>&gt;<i> * Xaml parsing/loading: I don't think this can happen during shutdown in
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> first place.
</I>&gt;<i> * Others?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [1] The idea is to ensure that no more user code is executed anymore, so it
</I>&gt;<i> would be called after the domain jobs have been cleared, but before
</I>&gt;<i> mono_domain_finalize is called in appdomain.c:unload_thread_main. It also
</I>&gt;<i> requires making mono_domain_unload async. One possible way would be to have
</I>&gt;<i> the equivalent of this API:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MonoUnloadData *mono_domain_unload_begin (MonoDomain *domain, callback
</I>&gt;<i> *callback); // does everything in mono_domain_unload up to where it waits
</I>&gt;<i> for the unload thread
</I>&gt;<i> void mono_domain_unload_end (MonoUnloadData *data); // does the rest of
</I>&gt;<i> mono_domain_unload, including waiting for the unload thread.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [2] I'm assuming that it's still legal to execute managed code at this
</I>&gt;<i> point
</I>&gt;<i> (though we'd obviously have to make sure that we only execute code we can
</I>&gt;<i> control, not user code).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [3] This callback can be called from a different thread, it's trivial to
</I>&gt;<i> marshal the logic in 4) to the main thread and wait until that code has
</I>&gt;<i> executed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [4] We're not calling mono_domain_free right now, not sure why since I'd
</I>&gt;<i> assume we'd leak otherwise.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;2) we do managed cleanup: (Deployment::Dispose () is called) which calls
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;mono_domain_finalize (which will finalize every single object in that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;appdomain)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;3) we do native cleanup: we wait until the managed objects have freed
</I>&gt;<i> their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;native refs, which will cause a cascading effect of native objects
</I>&gt;<i> unreffing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;other native objects.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;4) the last object alive is the Deployment instance, and in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Deployment::~Deployment  we call mono_domain_unload (which will abort all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;managed threads)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;b) Expose a method in the mono runtime that aborts all the managed
</I>&gt;<i> threads,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;and do that just before calling mono_domain_finalize. However I have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;feeling that the runtime folks won't think this is a good idea ;-) To me
</I>&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;feels like a dirty hack, especially since we'd basically duplicate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;mono_domain_unload.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Yes, domain unload is a very very tricky subject, so I think option (a) is
</I>&gt;<i> the way to go.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I think it would be a matter of pushing all unmanaged cleanup to happen
</I>&gt;<i> during domain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;unload. I suppose the whole problem is that mono_domain_unload is
</I>&gt;<i> asynchronous.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;We could extend the runtime interface to enable it to be done synchronous
</I>&gt;<i> or give back a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;native event object that will be pulsed when done - so batch parallel
</I>&gt;<i> unload is possible. If
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;that's not enough and there is a clear point during unload that ML needs a
</I>&gt;<i> hook for, we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;could add one too.
</I>&gt;<i>
