Hi David,

This sounds like some very interesting stuff. I'll look forward to
seeing this.

While you're correct that cairo supports neither of these features,
these are two features that people have been wanting to have in cairo
for quite a long time. So as you're developing, if you could give some
thought toward pushing this functionality down into cairo as much as
makes sense that would be very appreciated[*].

Have fun,

-Carl

[*] For example, the only sticking point in cairo for supporting
perspective transformations has been how this would impact the
cairo_stroke algorithm, (which has always worked with a fixed-width
pen). But recent work to implement cairo_stroke_to_path means that we
could do a pre-transform stroke and then transform the resulting path.
So with that out of the way, adding perspective transformations to cairo
should be quite easy.
