* cherrypicking fixes from mono/mcs might be hard. Not sure people (like
Rodrigo) are looking forward to backport fixes (like the verifier) to
several branches;

* do we move moon trunk now (or later) to mono/mcs trunk (2.7) ? I think
the right question is &quot;will Mono 2.8 be stable before, or at the time,
we plan to release 3.0?&quot;. IMO better wait a bit to know the answer...

* if we stage all (well most since 2.0/3.0 incompatibilities obviously
are bad candidates[1]) changes on trunk first then we need more bots
there (than the less used 2.0 branch)

* speaking of 2.0/3.0 incompatibilities, should we start fixing them now
or later ? It's gonna be hard (unless people use several VM) to have
both SL2 and SL3 running on Windows to compare results. Updating or not
SL will cause a different set of problems.

Sebastien

[1] another bad candidate are the changes to security attributes (and
audit data) since they need to be generated on the branch itself (not
copied over from a different code base)
