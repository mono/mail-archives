&gt;<i> Hey,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  In the unmanaged code it also seems like we're using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Element&quot; in a different way than the managed code - to mean &quot;Source&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we're limiting source elements to FrameworkElements, when it should be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DependencyObject, right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the naming has confused people. The 'source' object can be
</I>&gt;<i> anything at all. The only condition is that when you're binding to a
</I>&gt;<i> regular CLR object, you must target one of it's properties, you cannot
</I>&gt;<i> binding a public field.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the idea is that you bind a DependencyProperty on a
</I>&gt;<i> FrameworkElement to a property value on an object.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Source = object
</I>&gt;<i> Target = FrameworkElement
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
In the general case, yes.  I was talking specifically about the unmanaged
case there, which can only directly handle the the source object being a
DependencyObject subclass (and the the path referring to a
DependencyProperty).  Right now the unmanaged code lists both source and
target as FrameworkElements.  Clearly this is wrong, and since the unmanaged
hookups rely on DependencyObject::OnPropertyChanged...

But I take it you agreed with my assessment: The naming in both managed and
unmanaged code (and typing in unmanaged code) needs to change?

&gt;<i> I've been thinking about the ReadLocalValue implementation we have now.
</I>
We have one? Last time i looked we didn't ;) I don't think there's a
&gt;<i> native equivalent of this method yet, and we do need one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
see my response to myself... :)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Right now in FrameworkElement::SetValueImplWithError, we check to see if
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; value we're setting is BindingExpression/Style, and use that value as the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; current_value for the Property, just so we get ReadLocalValue semantics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not quite. I'm just going to take Styles as my example:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Firstly, bear in mind that what we want is for the GetValue logic to
</I>&gt;<i> be a plain and simple lookup in a hashtable. Now, suppose we have a
</I>&gt;<i> standard Rectangle and we apply a style (rectangle.SetValue
</I>&gt;<i> (FrameworkElement.StyleProperty, myStyle)). In order to have the
</I>&gt;<i> simple logic in GetValue, we have to iterate all the Setters in the
</I>&gt;<i> style and apply their value in a series of SetValue calls. Psuedo code
</I>&gt;<i> for what's in DO::SetValueWithError:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> if (property == FrameworkElement.StyleProperty) {
</I>&gt;<i>    Style style = (Style)value;
</I>&gt;<i>    foreach (Setter setter in style)
</I>&gt;<i>        SetValue (setter.Property, setter.Value);
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Not incredibly important, but this wouldn't be done in SetValue - it should
be done in FrameworkElement::OnPropertyChanged.


&gt;<i> Unfortunately this means that it's now impossible to tell what the
</I>&gt;<i> 'LocalValue' is. We can't just call GetValueNoDefault because there is
</I>&gt;<i> now a value there, but that value is *not* a local value. Styles
</I>&gt;<i> aren't considered local values. So, by getting our simple logic for
</I>&gt;<i> GetValue, it's now impossible to use GetValueNoDefault to get
</I>&gt;<i> ReadLocalValue semantics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
no need.  as you mention below we could have (and should have)
ReadLocalValue in unmanaged code.

This leads me to another point. Suppose we style the WidthProperty and
&gt;<i> we also databind it. Lets assume databinding is first, then styling is
</I>&gt;<i> second.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When we databind, the local value is set. Then, when we apply the
</I>&gt;<i> style, nothing happens as we've already applied a local value. If we
</I>&gt;<i> remove the databinding, the value of the style should be automatically
</I>&gt;<i> be set and ReadLocalValue will return DependencyProperty.UnsetValue to
</I>&gt;<i> indicate there is no locally set value.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think what we need is an unmanaged equivalent of GetValue and
</I>&gt;<i> ReadLocalValue.
</I>

agreed - we do need those, and we already have the former.

I think it would be simplest to implement it as:
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ReadLocalValue (DependencyProperty property) {
</I>&gt;<i>    if (databindings.Contains (property))
</I>&gt;<i>        return databindings [property];
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    // Check for other 'local values'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    // Finally, return the current_value in the hash table.
</I>&gt;<i>    return current_values [property];
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yes


&gt;<i> GetValue (DependencyProperty property) {
</I>&gt;<i>    Value *value = ReadLocalValue ();
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    if (value is BindingExpression)
</I>&gt;<i>        return ((BindingExpression)value).GetValue ();
</I>

there's no reason for this.  The local always takes precedence over styles,
and data binding would set the current_value.  If there's a current value we
return it.  A binding is not a container for a value.  It's simply a linkage
that hooks up property change notifications with SetValue calls.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    if (value == null &amp;&amp; (value = GetValue (StyleProperty) != null)
</I>&gt;<i>        value = style.GetValue (property);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    // If this property does not have a style attached, the above call
</I>&gt;<i> will return null
</I>&gt;<i>    // so we return the default value for the DependencyProperty instead
</I>&gt;<i>    if (value == null)
</I>&gt;<i>        value = property.DefaultValue;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    return value;
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The benefit of this approach (as I see it) is that Style values will
</I>&gt;<i> magically get applied/ignored correctly whenever the local value is
</I>&gt;<i> changed. This means that styles do not have to listen for property
</I>&gt;<i> changes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm also definitely hoping to keep as much logic (and, uh, re-entrancy :)
out of GetValue as possible.  Styles may force that, but databindings don't.


&gt;<i> Taking a step back, this will also simplify databindings. The
</I>&gt;<i> DataBinding class won't have to listen for property changed events
</I>&gt;<i> either. In the case of a one way binding what would happen is that the
</I>&gt;<i> databinding would raise the PropertyChanged event rather than calling
</I>&gt;<i> SetValue directly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
There's no reason to do this.  Bindings are considered local values, so when
you set a binding on a property, it should clear the previous local value,
so the binding can just call SetValue.  We still have things that shouldn't
be calling OnPropertyChanged calling it.  we shouldn't add another.

One point I was trying to get across in my first message is the possibility
that &quot;current_values&quot; != &quot;local_values&quot; -- It's simply the hash of current
values of properties based on whatever mechanism we want.  It's sole purpose
is to make GetValue() a simple hash lookup.  If you think about it that way,
it seems to me that we can do pretty much everything in the Setters
(SetValue, SetBinding, etc) and ClearValue.  It changes logic slightly, and
involves &quot;re-instating&quot; values from lower precedence providers (templates,
styles, etc) when higher precedence values aren't available (specifically in
ClearValue), but this also moves everything that might be (serious
air-quotes here) &quot;expensive&quot; to cases where we already know there's an
expense - areas where we generate property change notifications.

another alternative is of course to rename &quot;current_values&quot; to
&quot;local_values&quot; and start making things explicit.
