<PRE>Hey,

&gt;<i>  In the unmanaged code it also seems like we're using
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Element&quot; in a different way than the managed code - to mean &quot;Source&quot;, and
</I>&gt;<i> we're limiting source elements to FrameworkElements, when it should be
</I>&gt;<i> DependencyObject, right?
</I>
I think the naming has confused people. The 'source' object can be
anything at all. The only condition is that when you're binding to a
regular CLR object, you must target one of it's properties, you cannot
binding a public field.

So the idea is that you bind a DependencyProperty on a
FrameworkElement to a property value on an object.

Source = object
Target = FrameworkElement

&gt;<i> I've been thinking about the ReadLocalValue implementation we have now.
</I>
We have one? Last time i looked we didn't ;) I don't think there's a
native equivalent of this method yet, and we do need one.

&gt;<i> Right now in FrameworkElement::SetValueImplWithError, we check to see if the
</I>&gt;<i> value we're setting is BindingExpression/Style, and use that value as the
</I>&gt;<i> current_value for the Property, just so we get ReadLocalValue semantics.
</I>
Not quite. I'm just going to take Styles as my example:

Firstly, bear in mind that what we want is for the GetValue logic to
be a plain and simple lookup in a hashtable. Now, suppose we have a
standard Rectangle and we apply a style (rectangle.SetValue
(FrameworkElement.StyleProperty, myStyle)). In order to have the
simple logic in GetValue, we have to iterate all the Setters in the
style and apply their value in a series of SetValue calls. Psuedo code
for what's in DO::SetValueWithError:

if (property == FrameworkElement.StyleProperty) {
    Style style = (Style)value;
    foreach (Setter setter in style)
        SetValue (setter.Property, setter.Value);
}

Unfortunately this means that it's now impossible to tell what the
'LocalValue' is. We can't just call GetValueNoDefault because there is
now a value there, but that value is *not* a local value. Styles
aren't considered local values. So, by getting our simple logic for
GetValue, it's now impossible to use GetValueNoDefault to get
ReadLocalValue semantics.

&gt;<i> really don't like the overloading of the current_value hashtable to contain
</I>&gt;<i> things other than actual values, since it complicates both GetValue and
</I>&gt;<i> SetValue, and it seems to me that we don't need it -- ReadLocalValue is just
</I>&gt;<i> an indication of where the current value comes from.  So the current_value
</I>&gt;<i> hash should could contain within it the actual Value* associated with the
</I>&gt;<i> property, not the BindingExpression or Style object.
</I>
Currently it will never hold a Style object.

&gt;<i>  We'd have a separate
</I>&gt;<i> hash keyed on DP -- or maybe even just reuse the DependencyObject::bindings
</I>&gt;<i> hash and add one for the style as well -- to determine where the value comes
</I>&gt;<i> from.
</I>
This would be a do-able solution, possibly.
For a &quot;local&quot; value, i.e. one that was just set as a property, that
&gt;<i> hash would have NULL (or in the alternate case it wouldn't exist in either
</I>&gt;<i> bindings or style hashes.)  For BindingExpressions or Style Setters, it
</I>&gt;<i> would have the appropriate object.
</I>
This leads me to another point. Suppose we style the WidthProperty and
we also databind it. Lets assume databinding is first, then styling is
second.

When we databind, the local value is set. Then, when we apply the
style, nothing happens as we've already applied a local value. If we
remove the databinding, the value of the style should be automatically
be set and ReadLocalValue will return DependencyProperty.UnsetValue to
indicate there is no locally set value.

I think what we need is an unmanaged equivalent of GetValue and
ReadLocalValue. I think it would be simplest to implement it as:

ReadLocalValue (DependencyProperty property) {
    if (databindings.Contains (property))
        return databindings [property];

    // Check for other 'local values'.

    // Finally, return the current_value in the hash table.
    return current_values [property];
}

GetValue (DependencyProperty property) {
    Value *value = ReadLocalValue ();

    if (value is BindingExpression)
        return ((BindingExpression)value).GetValue ();
    if (value == null &amp;&amp; (value = GetValue (StyleProperty) != null)
        value = style.GetValue (property);

    // If this property does not have a style attached, the above call
will return null
    // so we return the default value for the DependencyProperty instead
    if (value == null)
        value = property.DefaultValue;

    return value;
}

The benefit of this approach (as I see it) is that Style values will
magically get applied/ignored correctly whenever the local value is
changed. This means that styles do not have to listen for property
changes.

Taking a step back, this will also simplify databindings. The
DataBinding class won't have to listen for property changed events
either. In the case of a one way binding what would happen is that the
databinding would raise the PropertyChanged event rather than calling
SetValue directly.

How does that sound?

Alan.
