I'm not sure if this is technically the correct list for querying about
licensing, but I do believe the people who know about those details do
read this list (I'll be sure to poke Miguel today when I see him to make
sure he's seen this).

&gt;<i>

</I>
It currently does expect the Mozilla libs to be there if you want to use
Moonlight as a browser plugin since Moonlight uses the Netscape Plugin
APIs (which are supported by most browsers iirc) plus, unfortunately,
some additional Gecko-specific APIs (we are hoping to fix Moonlight to
be browser agnostic).

However, it's not necessary to use Moonlight as a browser plugin, you
can also use it as a Gtk widget - in which case you need not worry at
all about the Mozilla dependencies.

&gt;<i>  Our embedded platform is likely to be a PPC variant with

</I>&gt;<i> will there be any way to bypass the requirement for Mozilla to lighten
</I>&gt;<i> the load. Will WebKit be supported?
</I>
We are definitely hoping to support WebKit.

I hope this helps,

Jeff
