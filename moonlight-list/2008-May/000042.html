<PRE>Hi,

There has been an interest to build Silverlight applications for the desktop
recently. The main problem is that we have no cross-platform way to do it.
There is the WebBrowser control in an SWF/MWF app hack, but it is ugly (from
a memory consumption, and software engineering point of vue), and do not
work on Mac since it still lacks the WebControl.

However, I have recently found the following article
<A HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/delay/archive/2008/03/10/lb-sv-wpf-silverlight-2-s-listbox-and-scrollviewer-controls-running-on-wpf.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/delay/archive/2008/03/10/lb-sv-wpf-silverlight-2-s-listbox-and-scrollviewer-controls-running-on-wpf.aspx</A>

I'm not an expert in WPF and Silverlight. At first I read that there were
many differences preventing easy ports from one lib to the other. But given
the article above, it looks like possible.

So the question is... wouldn't it be possible to implement WPF's XAML loader
based on Moonlight's XAML loader (it appear that there is some differences),
compile Silverlight's unique controls in a dll (those are already
implemented by Moonlight), and implement the bare minimum WPF to let a
managed application load a XAML file (or programmaticaly construct the
interface) using Silverlight controls instead of WPF's one.

Also, it would optimal if libraries made for Silverlight could be used by
such applications, but I guess it is not possible since such libraries
references completely different assemblies than those of a typical WPF app.

Any comment ?
