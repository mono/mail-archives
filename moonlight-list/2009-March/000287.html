&gt;<i> Hi moon-devs!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a follow-up of a discussion we've had on #moonlight about how to
</I>&gt;<i> enable A11Y on Moonlight in Linux. Before discussing the possible
</I>&gt;<i> options, I just wanted to remind you how we do it in WinForms (the 1.0
</I>&gt;<i> release is scheduled along with Mono 2.4):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. When WinForms is initialized, it tries to locate the UIA Provider
</I>&gt;<i> implementation in the GAC by using Assembly.Load() with the type,
</I>&gt;<i> version and PublicToken. This is to avoid a hard dependency on the
</I>&gt;<i> accessibility features, which should be optional (furthermore the UIA
</I>&gt;<i> API is part of .NET 3.5, olive).
</I>&gt;<i> 2. If the assembly is found (i.e. the UIAWinforms package is installed),
</I>&gt;<i> the Provider will do the same for the bridge assembly that connects UIA
</I>&gt;<i> with ATK, i.e. Assembly.Load(). This is to avoid a hard dependency on
</I>&gt;<i> the bridging of accessibility technologies (as it may happen in the
</I>&gt;<i> future that only UIA accessibility is used in both sides, with no need
</I>&gt;<i> of Atk; or because it may happen in the future as well that new bridges
</I>&gt;<i> to other technologies are done).
</I>&gt;<i> 3. If the assembly is found (i.e. the UiaAtkBridge is installed), it
</I>&gt;<i> loads the atk-bridge library (part of at-spi) and interacts with Atk
</I>&gt;<i> through atk-sharp.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, for Moonlight there will be some differences:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I. UIA Provider is not optional, as it comes implemented with the
</I>&gt;<i> widgets in the toolkits. Furthermore, UIA API resides in the
</I>&gt;<i> System.Windows.dll assembly, which is already provided by the Moonlight XPI.
</I>&gt;<i> II. We will develop another bridge (we cannot reuse the one used in
</I>&gt;<i> WinForms because the UIA API in SL is slightly different) that connects
</I>&gt;<i> the UIA Provider to the Atk technology. The bridge will be a managed
</I>&gt;<i> assembly that uses atk-sharp API. We will have to implement some new
</I>&gt;<i> NPAPI methods that try to load this bridge and, if successful, return an
</I>&gt;<i> IntPtr (AtkObject*) for Firefox to integrate it into its accessibility
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How we load this bridge is what we're suppose to discuss in this thread,
</I>&gt;<i> and the decision will be highly dependant on the approach we agree to
</I>&gt;<i> distribute this assembly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Possible ways of distribution:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> a) In the XPI of Moonlight itself (this seemed to be the preferred
</I>&gt;<i> election of some people in the IRC channel).
</I>&gt;<i> Disadvantage: it would pull some dependencies such as atk-sharp and
</I>&gt;<i> glib-sharp so the XPI size grows.
</I>&gt;<i> Advantage: everybody gets native accessibility support in Linux if they
</I>&gt;<i> have their corresponding A11Y client software installed (at-spi, screen
</I>&gt;<i> readers, etc.), without the need of packaging the bridge for every distro.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> b) In a package of the distribution.
</I>&gt;<i> Advantage: it's optional so we don't grow the size of the Moonlight XPI.
</I>&gt;<i> Disadvantage: only those who have a11y packages available in their
</I>&gt;<i> distro would get native Linux a11y support (but OBS would help on this).
</I>&gt;<i> Disadvantage: the loading mechanism would be trickier, as moonlight
</I>&gt;<i> should detect the presence of a system GAC (therefore, presence of Mono).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> c) In a 2nd XPI.
</I>&gt;<i> Advantage: it's optional so we don't grow the size of the Moonlight XPI.
</I>&gt;<i> Advantage: packaged for every Firefox user regardless of the distro used.
</I>&gt;<i> Disadvantage/Limitation?: can dependencies between extensions be
</I>&gt;<i> defined? Mmm, googled quickly and it seems to be supported:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=38&amp;t=458040&amp;start=0&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a">http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=38&amp;t=458040&amp;start=0&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Any comments agreeing/disagreeing? The estimated XPI size growth we are
talking about is:

* atk-sharp.dll: 180 KB
* glib-sharp.dll: 90 KB
* MoonUiaAtkBridge: ? KB (not developed yet, although we can estimate it
will have a similar size to the one in WinForms: 140 KB).

Thanks,


	Andr&#233;s


&gt;<i> Depending on the option agreed, we would to have to load it either by:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A: Hard dependency: System.Windows.dll would depend on the bridge, which
</I>&gt;<i> would depend on atk-sharp.dll, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> B: Local Reflection: System.Windows.dll would try to locate the bridge
</I>&gt;<i> from the Moonlight's GAC.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> C: Reflection to a different GAC: System.Windows.dll would try to locate
</I>&gt;<i> the bridge from the System GAC (I've done a proof of concept in
</I>&gt;<i> System.Windows.dll and this works specifying an absolute URI, although
</I>&gt;<i> some moon devs have stated that the fact that it worked may be a bug).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> D: Embedding API: we would use some mono_assembly_load_* if we decide
</I>&gt;<i> that moonlight should load the bridge instead of the UIA Provider.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Did I miss advantages/disadvantages? Is some option a very clear
</I>&gt;<i> candidate? Any feedback is appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!
