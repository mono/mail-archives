The environment variables are all explained in the url I sent you about
setting up parallel Mono installations. I'm guessing you didn't read it.

The PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable is in the documentation for pkg-config.

These are the sorts of things that are common knowledge for developers
working under Linux - every project has different environment variables,
but it's basically the same for every FLOSS project out there.

We know it's a PITA, that's why we don't suggest users compile it on
their own ;-)

</I>
Moonlight &quot;2.0&quot; is not ready for testing in this context, yet. Maybe
when we release a Beta it will be, but certainly not for an Alpha release.

An Alpha release is mostly just to show we are making progress and to
let &quot;hardcore&quot; users play around with it, but it's not for any real testing.

&gt;<i> however, at this point I'll be doing no testing. The only response I
</I>&gt;<i> get about the alpha, is &quot;You'll get it when it comes out.&quot;.  I can't
</I>&gt;<i> even tell if it's going to be another 5 months before we see an alpha
</I>&gt;<i> or not.
</I>
As I said above, the Moonlight 2.0 Alpha won't be useful to you for
testing the sorts of things you want to test. You'll want to wait for a
Beta release at least.
