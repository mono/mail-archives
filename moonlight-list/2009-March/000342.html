<PRE>I apologize if I sounded obtuse. I think it was more frustration from my
lack of &quot;knowing&quot;. I really do appericate all the hard work that has went
into this. I have done some linux programming and some unix programming
years ago. So please forgive me for asking questions that are probably
trival. I remember somethings but not a lot of things. I do not profess to
be a linux expert by any means. I've been doing programming with VS.NET for
a while and I guess I'm just use to using a great IDE that really takes
alot of the tedious make files and configurations out of the way.  One thing
I do have is persistance and I will get this or die in the process :)   I
will re-read the link you sent. Right now I have ubuntu setup in vm-ware, so
I don't really care if it overwrites the &quot;stable&quot; version of mono, (in
fact I don't have the stable version installed).

Again thank you all for the help you have provided thus far.

Sincerely,

Jason

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; problem is really the lack of documentation, it's about impossible for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; me to get this source and compile it properly.  You read the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; documentation (pasted below) and this is what it says to compile:  It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't say anything about the 9 different environment variables you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; need to set.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The environment variables are all explained in the url I sent you about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> setting up parallel Mono installations. I'm guessing you didn't read it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable is in the documentation for pkg-config.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> These are the sorts of things that are common knowledge for developers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> working under Linux - every project has different environment variables,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but it's basically the same for every FLOSS project out there.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We know it's a PITA, that's why we don't suggest users compile it on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their own ;-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; It's just frustrating, because I wanted to test it against a current
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; silverlight page I was working on;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Moonlight &quot;2.0&quot; is not ready for testing in this context, yet. Maybe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when we release a Beta it will be, but certainly not for an Alpha release.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> An Alpha release is mostly just to show we are making progress and to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> let &quot;hardcore&quot; users play around with it, but it's not for any real
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> testing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; however, at this point I'll be doing no testing. The only response I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; get about the alpha, is &quot;You'll get it when it comes out.&quot;.  I can't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; even tell if it's going to be another 5 months before we see an alpha
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; or not.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As I said above, the Moonlight 2.0 Alpha won't be useful to you for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> testing the sorts of things you want to test. You'll want to wait for a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Beta release at least.
