</I>

As Sandy has already pointed out, we use atk extensively and atk-sharp
is extremely useful for that (because we derive from Atk classes, use
GInterfaces, etc.). It's a usage very similar to what is done if you
want to create a Gtk+ widget with GtkSharp (but in our case it's not
just a class, but a lot of them).


&gt;&gt;<i> c) In a 2nd XPI.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Advantage: it's optional so we don't grow the size of the Moonlight XPI.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Advantage: packaged for every Firefox user regardless of the distro used.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Disadvantage/Limitation?: can dependencies between extensions be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> defined? Mmm, googled quickly and it seems to be supported:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=38&amp;t=458040&amp;start=0&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a">http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=38&amp;t=458040&amp;start=0&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is another viable option if you really want to ship all of those
</I>&gt;<i> extra libraries.
</I>
Ok, this seems the option that nobody dislikes, so I will look on it.


&gt;<i> I do not know why System.Windows.dll needs to have a hard dependency on
</I>&gt;<i> the bridge, it should probably have it on the accessibility assembly,
</I>
I didn't say it should have (indeed, maybe I confused the people making
them think that option (a) corresponded to initialization method (A),
and so on, which is not the case).


&gt;<i> and that assembly should likely have a soft dependency, and fall back
</I>&gt;<i> gracefully if libraries/packages are not installed.
</I>
Yeah, what happens here is that there's no accessibility assembly in
Silverlight (as opposed to the case of olive), so all that UIA stuff
goes in System.Windows.dll. Thus, we will do a soft-dependency here,
most likely with an InternalsVisibleTo attribute to the bridge assembly
as well.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A: Hard dependency: System.Windows.dll would depend on the bridge, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would depend on atk-sharp.dll, etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> B: Local Reflection: System.Windows.dll would try to locate the bridge
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from the Moonlight's GAC.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> C: Reflection to a different GAC: System.Windows.dll would try to locate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the bridge from the System GAC (I've done a proof of concept in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> System.Windows.dll and this works specifying an absolute URI, although
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some moon devs have stated that the fact that it worked may be a bug).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> D: Embedding API: we would use some mono_assembly_load_* if we decide
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that moonlight should load the bridge instead of the UIA Provider.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Did I miss advantages/disadvantages? Is some option a very clear
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> candidate? Any feedback is appreciated.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 	Andr&#233;s
