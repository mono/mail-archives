</I>
I was thinking more we could stuff something in the bridges, but I'm not 
sure what xpcom has in terms of accessibility, thus the questions.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I share sandy's confusion when it comes to atk-sharp/glib-sharp.  It's 
</I>&gt;<i> not like they're huge apis.  We could tune them to remove what we

</I>&gt;<i> we use off something that has a release # attached to it instead of a 
</I>&gt;<i> potentially large number of c&amp;p'ed pinvokes, especially given that any 
</I>&gt;<i> distribution mechanism we choose has an update mechanism available.
</I>
I wonder what they look like tuned.  The other question is whats the 
minver we're going to support in this case.  Isn't SLE10/RHAT something 
ancient?Additional concerns:

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       What about fully unmanaged items that we have, do they take part
</I>&gt;<i>     in a11y?  What about items that we have a light  managed wrapper
</I>&gt;<i>     over a native implementation, will there be enough information for
</I>&gt;<i>     you here?
</I>&gt;<i>     Is there a list of SL2 accessible controls and what they need?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The system.windows.automation.peer/system.windows.automation.provider 
</I>&gt;<i> namespaces (which I *think* are at least api complete wrt gui-compare) 
</I>&gt;<i> should show us the minimum we need to expose.  I don't think we need 
</I>&gt;<i> to do a comprehensive audit before beginning, though.  We can solve 
</I>&gt;<i> any issues as they come up - they're pretty much guaranteed to be small.
</I>
I'll take a look at them in gui-compare some time this weekend.

Thanks
