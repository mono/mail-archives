<PRE>I think toshok and I just had a good conversation discussing the
difference between my old and new text layout engines, so I figured I'd
send it to the list for reference. Not that anyone else is probably as
excited about this boring stuff as I am (because I've been living and
breathing text layout/rendering for the past year or so), but I'm
hopped-up on ELECTROLYTES so too bad.

&lt;jeff__&gt; <A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/~fejj/new-layout.patch">http://www.gnome.org/~fejj/new-layout.patch</A>
&lt;toshok&gt; but i'm not totally unhappy - we're making shrimp etoufee
&lt;jeff__&gt; that makes text layout so sexy it hurts
&lt;toshok&gt; + Brush *Background (bool selected)
&lt;toshok&gt; GetBackground
* toshok nazis a little bit :)
&lt;jeff__&gt; why ya always gotta be stealin my flavah, yo?
&lt;jeff__&gt; ;)
&lt;toshok&gt; curious: why the rewrite?
&lt;toshok&gt; does it bring textbox/textblock closer?
&lt;jeff__&gt; the old code was too hard to maintain
&lt;jeff__&gt; everytime I touch the old code, I break it
&lt;jeff__&gt; usually in mysterious ways
&lt;jeff__&gt; the new code is easier to tweak for optimizations as well
&lt;toshok&gt; nod
&lt;jeff__&gt; it already uses a ton less memory
&lt;jeff__&gt; and is *fast*
&lt;jeff__&gt; for selection
&lt;jeff__&gt; because selected regions are no longer treated like runs
&lt;jeff__&gt; which means I don't have to worry about kerning between
non-selected and selected regions
&lt;jeff__&gt; which means no jumping when selection crosses over kerned glyphs
&lt;jeff__&gt; it is mad sex
&lt;jeff__&gt; total new hotness
&lt;jeff__&gt; *and*
&lt;jeff__&gt; since selections are no longer treated as runs
&lt;jeff__&gt; it means we don't need to relayout *or* re-generate cached
glyph clusters
&lt;jeff__&gt; well, sometimes we have to regen glyph clusters
&lt;jeff__&gt; but the new code allows it to be really limited
&lt;jeff__&gt; to only the damaged regions
&lt;toshok&gt; glyph cluster?
&lt;jeff__&gt; yea, glyph strings
&lt;jeff__&gt; whatever
&lt;toshok&gt; just a run?
&lt;toshok&gt; run of glyphs with same attributes?
&lt;jeff__&gt; right
&lt;toshok&gt; cool
&lt;jeff__&gt; once you render a run once, it caches the complete cairo path
&lt;jeff__&gt; so further renders just blit the cached path
&lt;jeff__&gt; I call that a glyph cluster
&lt;jeff__&gt; but whatever
&lt;toshok&gt; not really a blit :)
&lt;toshok&gt; but nod
&lt;jeff__&gt; well, right
&lt;toshok&gt; what happens with large runs of text though?
&lt;toshok&gt; if we're caching the path, that is
&lt;jeff__&gt; so layout.cpp doesn't allow runs to span lines
&lt;jeff__&gt; so a TextLayoutRun is limited to a single line
&lt;toshok&gt; right, but the pathological case
&lt;toshok&gt; a long unbroken line
&lt;toshok&gt; btw, you should totally sign up:

&lt;jeff__&gt; at worst we'll have to draw the line w/o a cached path
&lt;jeff__&gt; but only *that* line
&lt;toshok&gt; no i'm asking if we're going to pay a huge memory overhead in
the pathological case
&lt;jeff__&gt; the rest will have cached paths
&lt;jeff__&gt; oh
&lt;jeff__&gt; nothing any worse than we would have before
&lt;toshok&gt; we were caching the path before?  i didn't know that
&lt;jeff__&gt; yea
&lt;toshok&gt; ok
&lt;jeff__&gt; basically, the difference between the new code and old code are:
&lt;jeff__&gt; 1. uses utf-8 instead of ucs4
&lt;jeff__&gt; 2. optimized for GetCursorFromXY (well, *more* optimized, can
still get better using a binary search)
&lt;jeff__&gt; 3. much MUCH cleaner code
&lt;jeff__&gt; 4. optimized for selections
&lt;toshok&gt; why the utf-8 switch?
&lt;jeff__&gt; 1. I'm trying to make it easier to drop pango in at some point
&lt;jeff__&gt; 2. because we already have UTF-8 strings as the TextProperty values
&lt;jeff__&gt; 3. typically less memory use
&lt;toshok&gt; nod, but potentially decreased performance for some ops?
&lt;jeff__&gt; iterating thru the string might be slightly less eficient
&lt;toshok&gt; i suppose it's not that bad..  advance tables are quick enough
- the only thing utf-8 sucks at is moving backward
&lt;jeff__&gt; right
&lt;jeff__&gt; also, note that because TextLayout now takes a UTF-8 string and
handles \r, \n, and \r\n internally, it means that text.cpp doesn't have
to break inline Runs into sub-strings
&lt;jeff__&gt; *and we eliminate the need to convert the data from utf-8 into
ucs4 anyway
&lt;jeff__&gt; so the old code was still doing the O(n) of iterating over a
utf-8 string to get ucs4 chars
&lt;jeff__&gt; but I eliminated that
&lt;jeff__&gt; so now it just does it once inside TextLayout::Layout()
&lt;jeff__&gt; instead of once inside TextBlock::Layout()
&lt;jeff__&gt; so net result is even tho we are now using utf-8 inside
layout.cpp, it should be no worse than before
&lt;toshok&gt; omg: <A HREF="http://twitpic.com/1s3ry">http://twitpic.com/1s3ry</A>
&lt;toshok&gt; nod
&lt;toshok&gt; well, sounds good.  just test the hell out of it :)
&lt;toshok&gt; the &quot;omg&quot; there is an 18lb road training bike with disc brakes
&lt;toshok&gt; i want
&lt;toshok&gt; since my carbon brakes work like shit in the rain
&lt;jeff__&gt; so... effectively the old TextBlock::Layout() code did O(n) to
scan for line-endings + O(n) to convert into ucs4, and then layout.cpp
did O(n) to strdup the ucs4 string, and then another O(n) for layout =
O(4n); new code is O(3n)
&lt;jeff__&gt; I was trying to get it down to O(2n) earlier by not strduping
the utf8 string in layout-&gt;SetText(), but that's more fragile for
TextBox because of the way the TextProperty is updated
&lt;jeff__&gt; I think it's doable, but it'll require some more thought
&lt;toshok&gt; i'd say it's not worth it unless you can prove its a hotspot
&lt;jeff__&gt; toshok: as far as testing goes, yea, no kidding ;-) that's why
I haven't committed yet
&lt;jeff__&gt; yea, so I probably won't bother getting it down to 2n
&lt;jeff__&gt; because I doubt it's a hotspot
&lt;jeff__&gt; and it's not the most expensive 'n'
&lt;jeff__&gt; the most expensive 'n' is the pass in TextLayout::Layout()
&lt;jeff__&gt; because of all the glyph lookups, etc
&lt;jeff__&gt; and obviously the utf8-&gt;ucs4 conversion
&lt;jeff__&gt; plus the double math
&lt;jeff__&gt; etc ;)
&lt;jeff__&gt; you following levi too?
&lt;jeff__&gt; that definitely looks like it's built for rainy days
