</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem is really the lack of documentation, it's about impossible for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; me to get this source and compile it properly.  You read the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; documentation (pasted below) and this is what it says to compile:  It
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't say anything about the 9 different environment variables you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need to set.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The environment variables are all explained in the url I sent you about
</I>&gt;<i> setting up parallel Mono installations. I'm guessing you didn't read it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable is in the documentation for pkg-config.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These are the sorts of things that are common knowledge for developers
</I>&gt;<i> working under Linux - every project has different environment variables,
</I>&gt;<i> but it's basically the same for every FLOSS project out there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We know it's a PITA, that's why we don't suggest users compile it on
</I>&gt;<i> their own ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's just frustrating, because I wanted to test it against a current
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; silverlight page I was working on;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Moonlight &quot;2.0&quot; is not ready for testing in this context, yet. Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> when we release a Beta it will be, but certainly not for an Alpha release.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An Alpha release is mostly just to show we are making progress and to
</I>&gt;<i> let &quot;hardcore&quot; users play around with it, but it's not for any real
</I>&gt;<i> testing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; however, at this point I'll be doing no testing. The only response I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get about the alpha, is &quot;You'll get it when it comes out.&quot;.  I can't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; even tell if it's going to be another 5 months before we see an alpha
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I said above, the Moonlight 2.0 Alpha won't be useful to you for
</I>&gt;<i> testing the sorts of things you want to test. You'll want to wait for a
</I>&gt;<i> Beta release at least.
