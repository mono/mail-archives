<PRE>Hey,

Sorry for joining the party late, I just now realized that I wasn't
subscribed to the list.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         Doesn't firefox provide its own accessibility plumbing for

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         digging here.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Firefox definitely doesn't provide accessibility plumbing for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; plugins (or at least nothing in a form we can use if we want to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; remain browser agnostic).  extensions perhaps, since they can tie
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; directly into the chrome via an overlay, but that doesn't help us.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>Sporadically over the past two weeks, I've been working with David
Bolter from Mozilla's Accessibility team, and the way we've agreed on to
allow Moonlight to inject itself into the Firefox a11y hierarchy is via
a new enum value on NPN_GetValue: NPNVNativeAccessible.

When the page changes, Firefox walks the DOM, generating AtkObjects for
every node, and when it hits a plugin, it usually inserts a dummy
placeholder.  With my WIP patch (bmo #480317), it calls NPN_GetValue to
see if the plugin has a native accessible, and will insert that instead.
All we have to do is handle this new value in our NPN_GetValue
implementation, so there is no additional API needed, allowing us to
(hopefully) remain compatible with other NPAPI implementations.

&gt;<i> &gt; I share sandy's confusion when it comes to atk-sharp/glib-sharp.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's not like they're huge apis.  We could tune them to remove what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we don't need in the moonlight case, but I'd *much* rather base
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whatever we use off something that has a release # attached to it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instead of a potentially large number of c&amp;p'ed pinvokes, especially
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; given that any distribution mechanism we choose has an update
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mechanism available.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I wonder what they look like tuned.  The other question is whats the
</I>&gt;<i> minver we're going to support in this case.  Isn't SLE10/RHAT
</I>&gt;<i> something ancient?Additional concerns:
</I>
As far as Atk is concerned, I don't think we have any need for libatk to
be recent, so my suspicion is that we'll run fine on SLE10.  And, if we
keep our fancy GLib API use to a minimum, we should be fine with
whatever version is running there also.

&gt;<i> &gt;           What about fully unmanaged items that we have, do they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         take part in a11y?  What about items that we have a light
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         managed wrapper over a native implementation, will there be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         enough information for you here?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         Is there a list of SL2 accessible controls and what they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         need?
</I>
All of the Silverlight 2.0 controls open sourced by Microsoft need to be
accessible.  I'm not sure what that means for you guys, but the list is:

Button
CheckBox
ComboBox
DataGrid
DatePicker
GridSplitter
HyperlinkButton
Image
ListBox
MediaElement
MultiScaleImage
PasswordBox
ProgressBar
RadioButton
ScrollViewer
Slider
TabControl
TabItem
TextBlock
TextBox
ToggleButton

Best,

-Brad
