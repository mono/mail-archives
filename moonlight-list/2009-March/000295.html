</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     Disadvantage: it would pull some dependencies such as atk-sharp and

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I would not want to ship glib-sharp, atk-sharp or anything like that.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     The UIA code probably should not use those either, it likely can get

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Agreed, you cannot possibly need that many functions that you cannot
</I>&gt;<i>     just pinvoke them directly.
</I>
Already discussed above, I'm afraid not using atk-sharp is a no-go.


&gt;<i>     Additionally, I'm not keen on the glue associated with them. 
</I>
What's the problem with them? Besides, the glue has been reduced a lot
on trunk (especially in glib-sharp) as it has been replaced by a lot of
marshaling structures (C#).


&gt;<i>     Doesn't firefox provide its own accessibility plumbing for
</I>&gt;<i>     extensions/plugins anyways?  Someone needs to do some digging here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Firefox definitely doesn't provide accessibility plumbing for plugins
</I>&gt;<i> (or at least nothing in a form we can use if we want to remain browser
</I>&gt;<i> agnostic).  
</I>
That plumbing mechanism is already being researched by Brad, adding a
new NPAPI call blessed by the Mozilla devs.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I share sandy's confusion when it comes to atk-sharp/glib-sharp.  It's
</I>&gt;<i> not like they're huge apis.  We could tune them to remove what we don't
</I>&gt;<i> need in the moonlight case, but I'd *much* rather base whatever we use
</I>&gt;<i> off something that has a release # attached to it instead of a
</I>&gt;<i> potentially large number of c&amp;p'ed pinvokes, especially given that any
</I>&gt;<i> distribution mechanism we choose has an update mechanism available.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> c) In a 2nd XPI.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Advantage: it's optional so we don't grow the size of the Moonlight XPI.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Advantage: packaged for every Firefox user regardless of the distro used.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Disadvantage/Limitation?: can dependencies between extensions be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> defined? Mmm, googled quickly and it seems to be supported:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=38&amp;t=458040&amp;start=0&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a">http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=38&amp;t=458040&amp;start=0&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a</A> &lt;<A HREF="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=38&amp;t=458040&amp;start=0&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a">http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=38&amp;t=458040&amp;start=0&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is another viable option if you really want to ship all of those
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extra libraries.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We can also provide an accessibility download in much the same way as we do with codecs in the xpi case.  Maybe flesh out the both the
</I>&gt;<i> go-mono.com/moonlight &lt;<A HREF="http://go-mono.com/moonlight">http://go-mono.com/moonlight</A>&gt; page, and also the right click menu/properties dialog.
</I>
Agreed.


&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  I do not know why System.Windows.dll needs to have a hard dependency on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the bridge, it should probably have it on the accessibility assembly,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and that assembly should likely have a soft dependency, and fall back
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gracefully if libraries/packages are not installed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Agreed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     B: Local Reflection: System.Windows.dll would try to locate the bridge
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     from the Moonlight's GAC.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     C: Reflection to a different GAC: System.Windows.dll would try to locate
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     the bridge from the System GAC (I've done a proof of concept in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     System.Windows.dll and this works specifying an absolute URI, although
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     some moon devs have stated that the fact that it worked may be a bug).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     D: Embedding API: we would use some mono_assembly_load_* if we decide
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     that moonlight should load the bridge instead of the UIA Provider.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Lets keep in mind, moonlight doesn't really have a &quot;gac&quot;, and will
</I>
Then what is the &quot;gac&quot; dir that is installed inside the folder in which
the extension is installed? Besides, loading assemblies from that GAC
seems to work.


&gt;<i>     certainly not go loading stuff from /usr/lib/whatever if its been
</I>&gt;<i>     installed from xpi.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
What's the technical reason against this loading mechanism?
I ask this because even with the (c) path chosen, I guess I will have to
locate the assembly by using path, as it seems that the 2nd extension
will be installed in a different place than the moonlight one.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Additional concerns:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>       What about fully unmanaged items that we have, do they take part
</I>&gt;<i>     in a11y?  What about items that we have a light  managed wrapper
</I>&gt;<i>     over a native implementation, will there be enough information for
</I>&gt;<i>     you here?
</I>&gt;<i>     Is there a list of SL2 accessible controls and what they need?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The system.windows.automation.peer/system.windows.automation.provider
</I>&gt;<i> namespaces (which I *think* are at least api complete wrt gui-compare)
</I>&gt;<i> should show us the minimum we need to expose.  I don't think we need to
</I>&gt;<i> do a comprehensive audit before beginning, though.  We can solve any
</I>&gt;<i> issues as they come up - they're pretty much guaranteed to be small.
</I>
Yeah, we don't have to worry about that part IMO. Most likely our
AtkBridge will obtain enough information from the UIA API that is there,
or even implemented in the Microsoft controls so I don't think we'll
generally need to P/Invoke into the moon API.

Thanks,
