</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Regardless of the method picked for distribution of the a11y support of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> moonlight (discussed on previous thread about this), we need to use
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> atk-sharp for hooking our classes into the GObject framework that is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> used by Atk, and thus this implies that glib-sharp (which is a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> dependency of atk-sharp) needs to be built against the 2.1 profile.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Like I said on IRC &quot;there are tons of ways of doing this, some more
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> painful than others&quot;. With the few previous details above you may be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> looking at quite a masochist way.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Seriously can you show us the pros and cons of each strategy you looked
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> at ? because I strongly feel you did not consider (everything) that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> working with moonlight/coreclr requires.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Since glib-sharp uses a lot of marshaling API (which is not present
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> anymore as public in Silverlight) we need to add it to the list of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> InternalsVisibleTo assemblies, with the patch attached. 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You're making the (wrong) assumption that mscorlib.dll internals are
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> stable, while they are not.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I.e. the tuner analyze the assemblies from mcs[1] and internalize or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> _remove_ stuff that is not needed (publicly or at all). This is done
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> each time the assemblies are rebuild, meaning that a change inside moon
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (or even mcs[2]) could remove stuff you depend on. Since this is done
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> automatically you can never be sure if your own assemblies, using
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> InternalsVisibleTo or not, will have what it requires to execute.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have 2 patches for gtk-sharp module:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) First one, with code changes, that add #if NET_2_1 sections.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That could help (or not) but I can't comment without seeing the
</I>&gt;<i> patch ;-)
</I>
The patches are here:


(I still have to polish them and hook our build process to this
gtk-sharp build process. And yes, there are some changes to the
generator that may seem weird, but I expect to discuss and have the
review about them later, I mean, I was thinking of having this patches
committed in a step by step process.)


&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Second, with autotools changes, that build glib-sharp with smcs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does not really matter.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If the internals of mscorlib suddendly disappeared or were made internal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when we need them public, we would notice it as soon as this special
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> build fails.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or as soon as the code was shipped ? Even then if you find out &#65279;it's
</I>&gt;<i> broken &quot;just before&quot; how do you go fixing it ? &#65279;it will be a bit late to
</I>&gt;<i> ask us to change our build process.
</I>&gt;<i> And that's assuming the failure is easy to find (e.g. compile time
</I>&gt;<i> versus run time, like something that use reflection).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway if your build is out of the &quot;main loop&quot; you'll always be in
</I>&gt;<i> reactive (and painful) mode.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Ok, so I assume we want a special process/tool that checks, ahead of
time, the API elements that glib-sharp is using in order to prevent this
problem from happening in your &quot;main loop&quot; right? I'll look into that,
but anyway this patch will still be needed, right?


&gt;&gt;<i> What other technique do you propose? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does not compute, insufficient data. End-of-line ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Using tuning for the glib-sharp
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> assembly that gets built on the &quot;&lt;2.1&quot; profile?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Using the tuner, with some tweaks*, could solve a lot of issues (but
</I>&gt;<i> mostly the ones I have not talked about)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * &#65279;your case does not match what's being done in mcs nor moon
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> [1] assemblies from moon are also processed but with fewer steps
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (security attributes)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> [2] we had one case earlier this week where the internals changed a lot
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> when SafeFileHandle was introduced (and later removed).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You're also assuming that the internals you need will have the &quot;right&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> security attributes to be used (from your caller), which may not be the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> case (and, just like the visibility, may change anytime).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was not assuming that. What I was assuming is that we won't need to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> care about the security attributes if we have already agreed that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> glib-sharp will be loaded as platform code, or am I missing something?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Definitively. Being &quot;platform code&quot; does not make the code omnipotent
</I>&gt;<i> (fully trusted). The rules stays the same* and this means _caring_ about
</I>&gt;<i> the security attributes. Otherwise it would not make sense to have
</I>&gt;<i> attributes since all non-platform code is transparent (i.e. without
</I>&gt;<i> attributes)
</I>
Ok, I have to read more about this SL security stuff, sorry for my lack
of knowledge! I was assuming that &quot;platform-code&quot; meant &quot;full-trust&quot;. Is
there a way to have a &quot;full-trust&quot; mode or do we need some API items
lists like the ones I'm seeing in some patches being committed (.scc
files, right?)


&gt;<i> * almost, there are a few subtle differences wrt visibility (but nothing
</I>&gt;<i> that would help you)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This step of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> course is under the assumption that our stuff will be loaded as platform
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> code, since it will be indeed part of moonlight infrastructure, and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> because it wouldn't be possible otherwise (as glib-sharp needs to use
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> P/Invoke extensively).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Sorry but 1 + 1 == 2, not 3. Loading your code as &quot;platform code&quot; won't
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> make glib-sharp able to p/invoke. 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You may have read something like &quot;only platform code can p/invoke&quot; but
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that's not the whole truth. The right explanations are that &quot;only
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> platform code can contain critical code&quot; and &quot;only critical code can
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> p/invoke&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yeah, sorry that I didn't use the exact wording.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Now mix this fact with &quot;all code, even platform code, is by default
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> transparent&quot; and you'll see that even if moonlight &quot;bless&quot; glib-sharp as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;platform code&quot; it won't be able to p/invoke (without multiple changes).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ok, I'm lost on this one, which multiple changes?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At a minimum:
</I>&gt;<i> * adding the right security attributes everywhere;
</I>&gt;<i> * adjusting the visibility of all the API (against reflection);
</I>&gt;<i> in your code and glib-sharp (and any friend you wish to include).
</I>
I'll look into this.


&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The patch for making our stuff be loaded as platform code is still in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the works. I've discussed briefly how to do this with Sebastien, as he's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> working on some security-related patches that will affect this.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Like I said &quot;this (platform code) is not a big problem&quot;. However it's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> _not_ the only problem you're facing. The stuff above does not even
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> touch the security problem you need to consider with this approach.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So, can I commit the patch attached? 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> No ;-)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Any feedback welcome. Thanks!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Now I don't want to sound negative, nor do I want to comment every patch
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with reasons why it won't work or be really painful (and believe me the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> pain I see is _much_ more on your side than mine ;-). However I need
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> more information before I can provide any useful hints.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sure, I'll be happy to provide any new information that is needed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let's take a step back and look at:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;quote&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Seriously can you show us the pros and cons of each strategy you looked
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> at ? because I strongly feel you did not consider (everything) that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> working with moonlight/coreclr requires.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/quote&gt;
</I>
So, with the patches posted above, and the proposal about including the
check-process in your mainloop, does this accomodate the pros/cons you
expect it to be included?

Thanks again,

	Andr&#233;s
