<PRE>Following up on a few points here.

Agreed, you cannot possibly need that many functions that you cannot 
just pinvoke them directly.
Additionally, I'm not keen on the glue associated with them.  Doesn't 
firefox provide its own accessibility plumbing for extensions/plugins 
anyways?  Someone needs to do some digging here.

&gt;&gt;<i> c) In a 2nd XPI.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Advantage: it's optional so we don't grow the size of the Moonlight XPI.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Advantage: packaged for every Firefox user regardless of the distro used.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Disadvantage/Limitation?: can dependencies between extensions be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> defined? Mmm, googled quickly and it seems to be supported:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=38&amp;t=458040&amp;start=0&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a">http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=38&amp;t=458040&amp;start=0&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is another viable option if you really want to ship all of those
</I>&gt;<i> extra libraries.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do not know why System.Windows.dll needs to have a hard dependency on
</I>&gt;<i> the bridge, it should probably have it on the accessibility assembly,
</I>&gt;<i> and that assembly should likely have a soft dependency, and fall back
</I>&gt;<i> gracefully if libraries/packages are not installed.
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>
Agreed.

&gt;&gt;<i> B: Local Reflection: System.Windows.dll would try to locate the bridge
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from the Moonlight's GAC.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> C: Reflection to a different GAC: System.Windows.dll would try to locate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the bridge from the System GAC (I've done a proof of concept in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> System.Windows.dll and this works specifying an absolute URI, although
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some moon devs have stated that the fact that it worked may be a bug).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> D: Embedding API: we would use some mono_assembly_load_* if we decide
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that moonlight should load the bridge instead of the UIA Provider.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>
Lets keep in mind, moonlight doesn't really have a &quot;gac&quot;, and will 
certainly not go loading stuff from /usr/lib/whatever if its been 
installed from xpi.

Additional concerns:

   What about fully unmanaged items that we have, do they take part in 
a11y?  What about items that we have a light  managed wrapper over a 
native implementation, will there be enough information for you here?
Is there a list of SL2 accessible controls and what they need?
