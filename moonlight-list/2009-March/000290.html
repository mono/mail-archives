</I>
Implementing atk interfaces, deriving from atk objects, overriding 
members...all this would be rather cumbersome without atk-sharp.  Not 
sure why you think implementing atk support would only require a 
&quot;handfull of calls&quot;.  Our team uses almost the entire atk-sharp API.

&gt;<i> Additionally, I'm not keen on the glue associated with them. Doesn't

</I>&gt;<i> anyways? Someone needs to do some digging here.
</I>
I can't speak for Andres/Brad/Mario, but I believe the major issue there 
is that it would exclude any sort of reuse for non-Firefox uses of 
Moonlight, like GtkSilver and other browser support.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> B: Local Reflection: System.Windows.dll would try to locate the bridge
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> from the Moonlight's GAC.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> C: Reflection to a different GAC: System.Windows.dll would try to locate
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the bridge from the System GAC (I've done a proof of concept in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> System.Windows.dll and this works specifying an absolute URI, although
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> some moon devs have stated that the fact that it worked may be a bug).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> D: Embedding API: we would use some mono_assembly_load_* if we decide
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that moonlight should load the bridge instead of the UIA Provider.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lets keep in mind, moonlight doesn't really have a &quot;gac&quot;, and will

</I>
Well I think that's what Andres is trying to figure out.  I believe we 
have little choice but to depend on atk-sharp and friends for our 
bridge, so the question is how do we ship this assembly.  We're just 
doing preliminary research as we near the start of this work, so 
hopefully we can have this figured out soon.

Thanks,
Sandy
