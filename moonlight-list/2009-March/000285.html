<PRE>Hi moon-devs!

This is a follow-up of a discussion we've had on #moonlight about how to
enable A11Y on Moonlight in Linux. Before discussing the possible
options, I just wanted to remind you how we do it in WinForms (the 1.0
release is scheduled along with Mono 2.4):

1. When WinForms is initialized, it tries to locate the UIA Provider
implementation in the GAC by using Assembly.Load() with the type,
version and PublicToken. This is to avoid a hard dependency on the
accessibility features, which should be optional (furthermore the UIA
API is part of .NET 3.5, olive).
2. If the assembly is found (i.e. the UIAWinforms package is installed),
the Provider will do the same for the bridge assembly that connects UIA
with ATK, i.e. Assembly.Load(). This is to avoid a hard dependency on
the bridging of accessibility technologies (as it may happen in the
future that only UIA accessibility is used in both sides, with no need
of Atk; or because it may happen in the future as well that new bridges
to other technologies are done).
3. If the assembly is found (i.e. the UiaAtkBridge is installed), it
loads the atk-bridge library (part of at-spi) and interacts with Atk
through atk-sharp.

Now, for Moonlight there will be some differences:

I. UIA Provider is not optional, as it comes implemented with the
widgets in the toolkits. Furthermore, UIA API resides in the
System.Windows.dll assembly, which is already provided by the Moonlight XPI.
II. We will develop another bridge (we cannot reuse the one used in
WinForms because the UIA API in SL is slightly different) that connects
the UIA Provider to the Atk technology. The bridge will be a managed
assembly that uses atk-sharp API. We will have to implement some new
NPAPI methods that try to load this bridge and, if successful, return an
IntPtr (AtkObject*) for Firefox to integrate it into its accessibility
hierarchy.

How we load this bridge is what we're suppose to discuss in this thread,
and the decision will be highly dependant on the approach we agree to
distribute this assembly.

Possible ways of distribution:

a) In the XPI of Moonlight itself (this seemed to be the preferred
election of some people in the IRC channel).
Disadvantage: it would pull some dependencies such as atk-sharp and
glib-sharp so the XPI size grows.
Advantage: everybody gets native accessibility support in Linux if they
have their corresponding A11Y client software installed (at-spi, screen
readers, etc.), without the need of packaging the bridge for every distro.

b) In a package of the distribution.
Advantage: it's optional so we don't grow the size of the Moonlight XPI.
Disadvantage: only those who have a11y packages available in their
distro would get native Linux a11y support (but OBS would help on this).
Disadvantage: the loading mechanism would be trickier, as moonlight
should detect the presence of a system GAC (therefore, presence of Mono).

c) In a 2nd XPI.
Advantage: it's optional so we don't grow the size of the Moonlight XPI.
Advantage: packaged for every Firefox user regardless of the distro used.
Disadvantage/Limitation?: can dependencies between extensions be
defined? Mmm, googled quickly and it seems to be supported:
<A HREF="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=38&amp;t=458040&amp;start=0&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a">http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=38&amp;t=458040&amp;start=0&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a</A>


Depending on the option agreed, we would to have to load it either by:

A: Hard dependency: System.Windows.dll would depend on the bridge, which
would depend on atk-sharp.dll, etc.

B: Local Reflection: System.Windows.dll would try to locate the bridge
from the Moonlight's GAC.

C: Reflection to a different GAC: System.Windows.dll would try to locate
the bridge from the System GAC (I've done a proof of concept in
System.Windows.dll and this works specifying an absolute URI, although
some moon devs have stated that the fact that it worked may be a bug).

D: Embedding API: we would use some mono_assembly_load_* if we decide
that moonlight should load the bridge instead of the UIA Provider.

Did I miss advantages/disadvantages? Is some option a very clear
candidate? Any feedback is appreciated.

Thanks!

	Andr&#233;s
