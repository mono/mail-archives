Hmm, I somehow missed the original message.

I would love to see this happen as well. Unfortunately, I think Apple's
reasoning for not allowing Flash is precisely because it doesn't want
there to be a cross-platform UI toolkit that can be used on its iPhone.
My guess is they'd pull the same move against Silverlight/Moonlight if
we were to attempt to do such a thing. That doesn't mean we can't work
with other smart phone vendors to port Moonlight to their platforms,
though (and I think Blackberry and Android are likely to be the other
biggest players). Also, I believe that Windows Phone 7 (or was it Kin?)
uses a Silverlight UI toolkit, so that would auto-magically bring
cross-platform support there, too.
