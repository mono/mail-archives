Hi Cristiano 

I'll try to answer your questions.

You are correct you do need to process the .xaml file into a .xaml.cs using
the xamlg.exe you can then include these .xaml.cs files in your project or
build script (you will need to regenerate the files if you make any xaml
changes). Not you will also need to use respack to package up the .xaml
files into a resources file which you include as well. Personally I use a
shell script to build my dll's which use xaml, MonoDevelop does allow you to
build Moonlight dll's (it will do the processing for you) but it does not
support moonlight desklets yet.

If you Host application has a reference to your dll which contains the xaml
then you can use new MyView().

the AppManifest only needs to contain files which has xaml in them,
currently I write this myself but I am working on an addition to my
origional patch which will auto generate the appmanifest based on the dll's
it finds in the application directory.

Also Just so you know this does work, I have recently created an application
for my company which is a WPF/Moonlight app. I do have to compile for each
platform but the same code is used for both applications. The only hard part
was writing the host application as under wpf it needed to use the WPF
window but under moonlight it needed to use a GTK window. But it works and
works well :D.

This is a link to the application which shows it working on Ubuntu. Note I
am not using mopen but and running my own custom host application (which can
cross compile to WPF). 

I would love to share the details on how I did this, but I'd need to clear
that with my company first (as they own the software).
