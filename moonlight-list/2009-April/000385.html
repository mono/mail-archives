It turns out I didn't have to compile anything, the binary worked. I didn't
recognize this at first because when I first tried it, I got the attached
error message:

<A HREF="http://www.nabble.com/file/p22840001/moonerror.png">http://www.nabble.com/file/p22840001/moonerror.png</A> 

If you don't see the image, it says &quot;Firefox could not install the file at
<A HREF="http://go-mono.com/archive/moonlight-plugins/latest/novell-moonlight-1.0.1-i586.xpi">http://go-mono.com/archive/moonlight-plugins/latest/novell-moonlight-1.0.1-i586.xpi</A>
because: Not a valid install package -207&quot;

When I first saw this, I assumed the binary install would not work. But
tonight I tried it again. When the error message popped up, I clicked ok,
and then clicked again on the link to download the plugin. The file download
picked up where it left off, so I wasn't starting again from scratch. I got
the error message four times, and four times I clicked to download it again.
Eventually it installed.

I don't know what the problem might have been. It might have something to do
with my 56K phone modem. I attach a second image which shows the
intermittent connection I had with your site, which was a problem throughout
the download. Maybe your site doesn't know how to deal with phone modems
very well? It finally worked, but it was very user unfriendly. I could see
how many newbies such as myself would give up. Maybe the problem is on my
end, maybe there is a bug on the server side, I don't know.

Thanks for your attention.
