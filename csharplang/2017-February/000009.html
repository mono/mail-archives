Problem:

Verbatim string literals are often used to copy in chunks of text such as
SQL or XML. It's not uncommon for this text to contain embedded
double-quotes, which then must be doubled-up in C# in order to be escaped.
This makes it obnoxious if you have to copy and paste the text back and
forth since it would have to be fixed each time.

string xml = @&quot;&lt;?xml version=&quot;&quot;1.0&quot;&quot;?&gt;&lt;root&gt;    &lt;item attr=&quot;&quot;foo&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/root&gt;&quot;;

Solution:

By supporting a custom notation for starting and ending a string literal it
enables evaluating the double quotes as part of the string that do not have
to be escaped. The programmer would use a pattern at the beginning of the
string which then must be matched to denote the end of the string.

Proposed syntax would be based on verbatim string syntax:

*raw-string-literal*:
@(&quot; *raw-string-literal-characters* opt &quot; )
@( *identifier* &quot; *raw-string-literal-characters* opt &quot; *identifier* )

*raw-string-literal-characters*:
Any characters except &quot; *identifer* opt )

The @ would be immediately followed by an open-parenthesis ((). Following
that is an optional delimiter which is any legal C# identifier and then a
double-quote. Next would be the raw string contents which would be
interpreted exactly as they appear in the file. The terminator of the
string literal would be a double quote immediately followed by the optional
delimiter and a close-parenthesis ()).

The following example is a raw string without a custom delimiter. It is
terminated simply by the sequence &quot;). Double quotes that appear within the
string are interpreted as a part of the string as long as they are not
followed by a close-parenthesis character ()).

string xml = @(&quot;&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;&lt;root&gt;    &lt;item attr=&quot;foo&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/root&gt;&quot;);

The following example is a raw string with a custom delimiter. As the
custom delimiter is specified as &quot;foo&quot; that sets the terminating sequence
to be &quot;foo). Any other characters are interpreted as a part of the string
literal, including any portion of the terminating sequence. Note that the
term &quot;foo&quot; appears within the string after a double-quote, but since it is
not also followed by a close-parenthesis ()) it is not considered the
terminating sequence of the literal.

In this example the custom delimiter is &quot;foo&quot;. Note that the attribute
value is not considered as the end of the string. However, if it was
followed by a parenthesis it would be and a different custom delimiter
might have to be chosen.

string xml = @(foo&quot;&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;root&gt;
    &lt;item attr=&quot;foo&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/root&gt;&quot;foo);

Here are examples of raw strings containing the syntax for other raw
strings:

string raw1 = @(foo&quot;string s = @(&quot;Hello!&quot;);&quot;foo);string raw2 =
@(bar&quot;string raw1 = @(&quot;string s = @(&quot;Hello!&quot;);&quot;foo);&quot;bar);string raw3
= @(baz&quot;string raw2 = @(bar&quot;string raw1 = @(&quot;string s =
@(&quot;Hello!&quot;);&quot;foo);&quot;bar);&quot;baz);

This syntax is loosely based on C++11 raw string literals, although I
personally don't care for the parenthesis or delimiter appearing within the
body of the string. I'm definitely not married to this syntax and
variations are welcome.

Existing UserVoice suggestion, using C++11-like syntax: Allow to have
custom delimiters in raw string literal
