<PRE>The other thread, where I posted roughly the same seems to have dropped off the mailing list a couple reply’s back, so I am posting here as well.


  *   we shall imbue C# with language about this type that we think is special
We don’t think this type is special. The runtime thinks this type is special and declares it to be so. It is also the only user visible primitive type that C# does not expose the operators for that the runtime defines for it.


  *   DateTime is also a massively used type in .Net.  As is Regex.  As is XElement.
Yes, these are commonly used types. But they are not part of the primitive types as defined by the runtime.

To help visualize the difference, here are two methods…

The first uses System.Decimal, a commonly used type:
public static decimal Add(decimal l, decimal r)
{
    return l + r;
}

The IL Generated for this method is:

.method public hidebysig static valuetype [mscorlib]System.Decimal
        Add(valuetype [mscorlib]System.Decimal l,
            valuetype [mscorlib]System.Decimal r) cil managed
{
  // Code size       8 (0x8)
  .maxstack  8
  IL_0000:  ldarg.0
  IL_0001:  ldarg.1
  IL_0002:  call       valuetype [mscorlib]System.Decimal [mscorlib]System.Decimal::op_Addition(valuetype [mscorlib]System.Decimal,
                                                                                                valuetype [mscorlib]System.Decimal)
  IL_0007:  ret
}

C# has a special keyword for this method
The runtime does not declare it primitive
In order to add two decimals together, the IL has to load both arguments and then emit a call to the op_Addition method implemented on the System.Decimal type


The second uses System.Int32, another commonly used type:
public static int Add(int l, int r)
{
    return l + r;
}

The IL Generated for this method is:
.method public hidebysig static int32
        Add(int32 l,
            int32 r) cil managed
{
  // Code size       4 (0x4)
  .maxstack  8
  IL_0000:  ldarg.0
  IL_0001:  ldarg.1
  IL_0002:  add
  IL_0003:  ret
}

C# has a special keyword for this method
The runtime declares it primitive
In order to add two ints together, the IL loads both arguments and emits an ‘add’ instruction. No method calls are involved


System.IntPtr is not like System.Decimal, it is like System.Int32. The IL that can and should be emitted for it involves absolutely no call instruction. C# does not support this.

Someone could write a method in IL that looks like the following:
.method public hidebysig static native int
        Add(native int l,
            native int r) cil managed
{
  // Code size       8 (0x8)
  .maxstack  8
  IL_0000:  ldarg.0
  IL_0001:  ldarg.1
  IL_0002:  add
  IL_0003:  ret
}

And then the closest we get when calling that method is:
.method public hidebysig static native int
        SomeMethod(native int l,
                   native int r) cil managed
{
  // Code size       8 (0x8)
  .maxstack  8
  IL_0000:  ldarg.0
  IL_0001:  ldarg.1
  IL_0002:  call       native int Add(native int, native int)
  IL_0007:  ret
}

As you can see, we still have a call in there where their shouldn’t be.

Personally, I’m not disagreeing with that.  What I’m asking is whether this warrants a very targeted language change (i.e. we shall imbue C# with language about this type that we think is special).  Or if we just treat the type as a normal .Net type, and we provide other features which end up making this coding experience more pleasant and end up addressing this problem.

--

For example, DateTime is also a massively used type in .Net.  As is Regex.  As is XElement.  But we don’t provide any special support for these types in the language (while VB does for Dates and Xml).   Occasionally we do bless a type (like Task&lt;&gt;), but even later we try to go back and try to make a generalized solution so that these types aren’t actually that special.  (i.e. using patterns for foreach, and moving to a generalized system to allow for ValueTask).

The question isn’t about if we should “interoperate well with other runtimes and languages” it’s “what’s the best way to interoperate well with other runtimes and languages”.  Maybe the answer to that truly is “just add support for these specific operations on exactly this type”.  But maybe the answer is that there are broader solutions that end up helping out more cases, but also end up solving this problem at the same time.

Subject: Re: [csharplang] Operators should be exposed for `System.IntPtr` and `System.UIntPtr`

Hello,

As a historical perspective, I can say that this choice was made extremely deliberately and after MUCH debate while creating the initial version of C#.

Thanks for sharing the historical perspective.

One of the design principles that we felt strongly about was the core data types (short, int, long, etc.) should be of standardized size and operation across all platforms. This is one of the things that we felt that Java had right, and C had wrong. We felt that it was doing programmers a grave disservice to allow them to write code where integers had different size limits or overflow behavior on different platforms, and this just led to code that was very hard to port between platforms with virtually no benefit. If you need to store integers larger than 2G, use a long, otherwise use an int. This is an algorithmic decision and the behavior shouldn’t change just because you are running on a 32 or 64 bit platform.

IntPtr and UIntPtr were introduced in the base class libraries for various reasons, and C# had to decide how to handle them. We realized that they did have a usefulness in P/Invoke and native interop scenarios, so we added the ability to explicitly cast from the regular integers to them and back. Further than that we were unwilling to go, very deliberately.

We really didn’t want programmers to write libraries that used size-specific integers in their public interface. By NOT putting operators on them, and by making casts to other integers have to be explicit, we made them painful enough that people did not use them as general “platform-specific integers”, like “int” is in C.

While this might have been an acceptable design decision 15 years ago for a v1 of the language on the dominant platform, C# now lives in diverse ecosystem, one where it needs to interoperate well with other runtimes and languages.   This is one of those things that just needs to be revisited.

Apple's APIs are both extensive and exhibit this issue, but they are by no means the only ones.

Miguel
