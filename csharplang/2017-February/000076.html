<PRE>The C# team decided to imbue String with said magickal properties.  There
are no IL opcodes for &quot;adding&quot; two Strings, nor are there overloaded
operators.

There already exists a general-purpose mechanism for providing
arithmetic(-like) operations in C# and that is through operator overloads.
For the vast, vast majority of cases that works perfectly well.  I don't
think anyone here would argue differently.  However, for IntPtr that
doesn't work particularly well, for two reasons:

1.  It is a very kludgy solution, requiring static method calls and
depending on specific behaviors of the runtime to amount to effectively a
single IL/native opcode.
2.  The BCL is written in C#, which would need native support for adding
IntPtr in order to write overloaded operators to fake adding IntPtr.

</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a historical perspective, I can say that this choice was made extremely
</I>&gt;<i> deliberately and after MUCH debate while creating the initial version of C#.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for sharing the historical perspective.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the design principles that we felt strongly about was the core data
</I>&gt;<i> types (short, int, long, etc.) should be of standardized size and operation
</I>&gt;<i> across all platforms. This is one of the things that we felt that Java had
</I>&gt;<i> right, and C had wrong. We felt that it was doing programmers a grave
</I>&gt;<i> disservice to allow them to write code where integers had different size
</I>&gt;<i> limits or overflow behavior on different platforms, and this just led to
</I>&gt;<i> code that was very hard to port between platforms with virtually no
</I>&gt;<i> benefit. If you need to store integers larger than 2G, use a long,
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise use an int. This is an algorithmic decision and the behavior
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn’t change just because you are running on a 32 or 64 bit platform.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IntPtr and UIntPtr were introduced in the base class libraries for various
</I>&gt;<i> reasons, and C# had to decide how to handle them. We realized that they did
</I>&gt;<i> have a usefulness in P/Invoke and native interop scenarios, so we added the
</I>&gt;<i> ability to explicitly cast from the regular integers to them and back.
</I>&gt;<i> Further than that we were unwilling to go, very deliberately.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We really didn’t want programmers to write libraries that used
</I>&gt;<i> size-specific integers in their public interface. By NOT putting operators
</I>&gt;<i> on them, and by making casts to other integers have to be explicit, we made
</I>&gt;<i> them painful enough that people did not use them as general
</I>&gt;<i> “platform-specific integers”, like “int” is in C.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While this might have been an acceptable design decision 15 years ago for
</I>&gt;<i> a v1 of the language on the dominant platform, C# now lives in diverse
</I>&gt;<i> ecosystem, one where it needs to interoperate well with other runtimes and
</I>&gt;<i> languages.   This is one of those things that just needs to be revisited.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apple's APIs are both extensive and exhibit this issue, but they are by no
</I>&gt;<i> means the only ones.
</I>&gt;<i>
