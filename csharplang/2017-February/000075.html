Personally, I’m not disagreeing with that.  What I’m asking is whether this warrants a very targeted language change (i.e. we shall imbue C# with language about this type that we think is special).  Or if we just treat the type as a normal .Net type, and we provide other features which end up making this coding experience more pleasant and end up addressing this problem.

--

For example, DateTime is also a massively used type in .Net.  As is Regex.  As is XElement.  But we don’t provide any special support for these types in the language (while VB does for Dates and Xml).   Occasionally we do bless a type (like Task&lt;&gt;), but even later we try to go back and try to make a generalized solution so that these types aren’t actually that special.  (i.e. using patterns for foreach, and moving to a generalized system to allow for ValueTask).

The question isn’t about if we should “interoperate well with other runtimes and languages” it’s “what’s the best way to interoperate well with other runtimes and languages”.  Maybe the answer to that truly is “just add support for these specific operations on exactly this type”.  But maybe the answer is that there are broader solutions that end up helping out more cases, but also end up solving this problem at the same time.

Subject: Re: [csharplang] Operators should be exposed for `System.IntPtr` and `System.UIntPtr`

Hello,

As a historical perspective, I can say that this choice was made extremely deliberately and after MUCH debate while creating the initial version of C#.

Thanks for sharing the historical perspective.

One of the design principles that we felt strongly about was the core data types (short, int, long, etc.) should be of standardized size and operation across all platforms. This is one of the things that we felt that Java had right, and C had wrong. We felt that it was doing programmers a grave disservice to allow them to write code where integers had different size limits or overflow behavior on different platforms, and this just led to code that was very hard to port between platforms with virtually no benefit. If you need to store integers larger than 2G, use a long, otherwise use an int. This is an algorithmic decision and the behavior shouldn’t change just because you are running on a 32 or 64 bit platform.

IntPtr and UIntPtr were introduced in the base class libraries for various reasons, and C# had to decide how to handle them. We realized that they did have a usefulness in P/Invoke and native interop scenarios, so we added the ability to explicitly cast from the regular integers to them and back. Further than that we were unwilling to go, very deliberately.

We really didn’t want programmers to write libraries that used size-specific integers in their public interface. By NOT putting operators on them, and by making casts to other integers have to be explicit, we made them painful enough that people did not use them as general “platform-specific integers”, like “int” is in C.

While this might have been an acceptable design decision 15 years ago for a v1 of the language on the dominant platform, C# now lives in diverse ecosystem, one where it needs to interoperate well with other runtimes and languages.   This is one of those things that just needs to be revisited.

Apple's APIs are both extensive and exhibit this issue, but they are by no means the only ones.

Miguel
