Subject: RE: [csharplang] Operators should be exposed for `System.IntPtr` and `System.UIntPtr`


  *   I don’t see how that’s relevant.  As I mentioned already, the runtime has *lots* of special things.  We’re not discussing the runtime here though.  We’re discussing the C# language.  It has never been a goal of the C# language to expose all the special pieces of the runtime or to give direct access to all the capabilities that the runtime has.

The C# language is closely tied to the runtime. In fact, it is so closely tied that you can never not consider the runtime. There are plenty of proposals (good ones too) that we have had to say: “This cannot currently be implemented because the runtime does not support or completely restricts this.” A number of these proposals are still open because we think they would provide enough value that we should work with the runtime to ensure such features are possible. As such, we always have to at very least ask: “Does the runtime support this?” for any language proposal.

As for your three questions:

  1.  Is this a good idea?
Several people seem to think so. Additionally, the change is trivial enough (from a language perspective) that Mads has let me open a PR for the official proposal.

  1.  Are existing approaches insufficient?
Yes. That is what myself and several others have been saying. They are a pain to work with, make code readability/maintainability harder, and are not as performant as the runtime allows them to be (the runtime already has a minimal overhead way to do this, we are saying C# should support the minimal overhead way, rather than requiring the runtime to be modified to support a slightly less than minimal overhead way).

  1.  Are their better proposals we could take that would provide more value and which would then give us this as well?
That is the other point I have been trying to raise. The answer to this is mostly no, because this is a special type. Because this is a special type, you can only provide the equivalent functionality on types that the runtime considers special. This requires the compiler to be aware of what these types are and to know that it should emit a single IL instruction for the operations on that type.

We could probably augment this proposal to support any new primitive types added to the runtime. However, I doubt very many new primitive runtime types will be added (if any are ever added) and the cost of creating a mechanism to extend support in that way would likely be not worth the effort in the long run (due to the expectation that no new primitive types will be added, if any are ever added).

Now, if you look at this from the perspective of a general proposal to support adding operators to existing types, then the answer is yes. The proposal exists and has been partially implemented (at least in prototype form): Extension Everything. However, even with such a feature (at the very least making 2 less of a problem, since being a pain to work with and making code readability/maintainability hard go out the window) this proposal would still exist, since this an optimization that only the compiler can make.


  *   It’s like telling me “VB should support pointers, because the runtime supports them”.  Just because the runtime supports something does not mean that I believe it should be exposed from the language.

VB and C# are wildly different in this regard. Mostly because C# is the language of choice (and always has been) for the core framework. This means that if C# doesn’t support it, chances of it being in the core framework drop (there are a some exceptions here and generally require the API to be written in IL). Additionally, C# does support pointers and is well known for being one of the best choices for writing interop code. This is one of the many ways that writing interop code could be improved even more, and if you want to bundle them all together into a feature and give it a name (like LINQ), then by all means do so.

But, most people aren’t going to be writing a single proposal for a set of features or even trying to tie multiple features together into a bundle. People are going to be targeting a single issue and opening a proposal on that, to limit scope. The Language Design team is going to be the thing that needs to say all these features on their own look good, and we’ll accept these ones if someone implements it and we’ll take these ones on ourselves because we see a set of proposals that would work really well together in the next language version.

Again, being a “part of the primitives types as defined by the runtime” is not an argument that carries any weight with me.  The runtime is simply a target platform for the C# language.  C# could compile down straight to native code for all I care.  It could compile down to JS.

The only places where I care about the CLR/CLI/.Net are where our language spec directly calls them out ☺

&gt;<i> As you can see, we still have a call in there where their shouldn’t be.
</I>
This is not a direct concern for me.  The runtime could have a direct way to deal with all sorts of things, and we might still not expose them from the C# language.  Again, it’s not a goal of the C# language to expose every piece of runtime functionality and have direct access to all runtime operations.

--

I feel like part of the message is getting lost here.

First, I’m not saying that want you want it inappropriate.  I think it’s completely reasonable to want C# to support these operators.

Second, I’m not saying that we would not do this.  I think this proposal is suitably small that we could take this.

Again, to reiterate, I’m not arguing against either of those things.


What I’m stating is that the *reasoning* provided so far is uncompelling to me.  Your arguments boil down to:


  1.  We should have this in C# because the runtime has this.
  2.  We should expose direct access to this because the existing mechanisms are unacceptable.  (i.e. too much overhead, or too onerous to implement).

I’m stating, firmly, that ‘a’ is non-viable.  It’s like telling me “VB should support pointers, because the runtime supports them”.  Just because the runtime supports something does not mean that I believe it should be exposed from the language.

I’m also stating that ‘b’ is uncompelling to me *until* actual data is provided showing that the existing available mechanisms are unacceptable.  For example, if the perf overhead was actually realistically bad.

--

Repeating to me that we should do this because “this type is special” is a non-starter argument.  To me, this type is not at all special.  Indeed, it’s so non-special that it is only mentioned a *single* time in the entire C# language spec.  It’s just a type.  It happens to have some interesting aspects about it that we *could* choose to expose.  But we should do that because it’s a good idea to do so, not just because the type is special.  What I’m trying to determine is:


  1.  is this a good idea?
  2.  Are existing approaches insufficient?
  3.  Are their better proposals we could take that would provide more value and which would then give us this as well?

Subject: RE: [csharplang] Operators should be exposed for `System.IntPtr` and `System.UIntPtr`

The other thread, where I posted roughly the same seems to have dropped off the mailing list a couple reply’s back, so I am posting here as well.


  *   we shall imbue C# with language about this type that we think is special
We don’t think this type is special. The runtime thinks this type is special and declares it to be so. It is also the only user visible primitive type that C# does not expose the operators for that the runtime defines for it.


  *   DateTime is also a massively used type in .Net.  As is Regex.  As is XElement.
Yes, these are commonly used types. But they are not part of the primitive types as defined by the runtime.

To help visualize the difference, here are two methods…

The first uses System.Decimal, a commonly used type:
public static decimal Add(decimal l, decimal r)
{
    return l + r;
}

The IL Generated for this method is:

.method public hidebysig static valuetype [mscorlib]System.Decimal
        Add(valuetype [mscorlib]System.Decimal l,
            valuetype [mscorlib]System.Decimal r) cil managed
{
  // Code size       8 (0x8)
  .maxstack  8
  IL_0000:  ldarg.0
  IL_0001:  ldarg.1
  IL_0002:  call       valuetype [mscorlib]System.Decimal [mscorlib]System.Decimal::op_Addition(valuetype [mscorlib]System.Decimal,
                                                                                                valuetype [mscorlib]System.Decimal)
  IL_0007:  ret
}

C# has a special keyword for this method
The runtime does not declare it primitive
In order to add two decimals together, the IL has to load both arguments and then emit a call to the op_Addition method implemented on the System.Decimal type


The second uses System.Int32, another commonly used type:
public static int Add(int l, int r)
{
    return l + r;
}

The IL Generated for this method is:
.method public hidebysig static int32
        Add(int32 l,
            int32 r) cil managed
{
  // Code size       4 (0x4)
  .maxstack  8
  IL_0000:  ldarg.0
  IL_0001:  ldarg.1
  IL_0002:  add
  IL_0003:  ret
}

C# has a special keyword for this method
The runtime declares it primitive
In order to add two ints together, the IL loads both arguments and emits an ‘add’ instruction. No method calls are involved


System.IntPtr is not like System.Decimal, it is like System.Int32. The IL that can and should be emitted for it involves absolutely no call instruction. C# does not support this.

Someone could write a method in IL that looks like the following:
.method public hidebysig static native int
        Add(native int l,
            native int r) cil managed
{
  // Code size       8 (0x8)
  .maxstack  8
  IL_0000:  ldarg.0
  IL_0001:  ldarg.1
  IL_0002:  add
  IL_0003:  ret
}

And then the closest we get when calling that method is:
.method public hidebysig static native int
        SomeMethod(native int l,
                   native int r) cil managed
{
  // Code size       8 (0x8)
  .maxstack  8
  IL_0000:  ldarg.0
  IL_0001:  ldarg.1
  IL_0002:  call       native int Add(native int, native int)
  IL_0007:  ret
}

As you can see, we still have a call in there where their shouldn’t be.

&gt;<i> While this might have been an acceptable design decision 15 years ago for a v1 of the language on the dominant platform, C# now lives in diverse ecosystem, one where it needs to interoperate well with other runtimes and languages.   This is one of those things that just needs to be revisited.
</I>
Personally, I’m not disagreeing with that.  What I’m asking is whether this warrants a very targeted language change (i.e. we shall imbue C# with language about this type that we think is special).  Or if we just treat the type as a normal .Net type, and we provide other features which end up making this coding experience more pleasant and end up addressing this problem.

--

For example, DateTime is also a massively used type in .Net.  As is Regex.  As is XElement.  But we don’t provide any special support for these types in the language (while VB does for Dates and Xml).   Occasionally we do bless a type (like Task&lt;&gt;), but even later we try to go back and try to make a generalized solution so that these types aren’t actually that special.  (i.e. using patterns for foreach, and moving to a generalized system to allow for ValueTask).

The question isn’t about if we should “interoperate well with other runtimes and languages” it’s “what’s the best way to interoperate well with other runtimes and languages”.  Maybe the answer to that truly is “just add support for these specific operations on exactly this type”.  But maybe the answer is that there are broader solutions that end up helping out more cases, but also end up solving this problem at the same time.

Subject: Re: [csharplang] Operators should be exposed for `System.IntPtr` and `System.UIntPtr`

Hello,

As a historical perspective, I can say that this choice was made extremely deliberately and after MUCH debate while creating the initial version of C#.

Thanks for sharing the historical perspective.

One of the design principles that we felt strongly about was the core data types (short, int, long, etc.) should be of standardized size and operation across all platforms. This is one of the things that we felt that Java had right, and C had wrong. We felt that it was doing programmers a grave disservice to allow them to write code where integers had different size limits or overflow behavior on different platforms, and this just led to code that was very hard to port between platforms with virtually no benefit. If you need to store integers larger than 2G, use a long, otherwise use an int. This is an algorithmic decision and the behavior shouldn’t change just because you are running on a 32 or 64 bit platform.

IntPtr and UIntPtr were introduced in the base class libraries for various reasons, and C# had to decide how to handle them. We realized that they did have a usefulness in P/Invoke and native interop scenarios, so we added the ability to explicitly cast from the regular integers to them and back. Further than that we were unwilling to go, very deliberately.

We really didn’t want programmers to write libraries that used size-specific integers in their public interface. By NOT putting operators on them, and by making casts to other integers have to be explicit, we made them painful enough that people did not use them as general “platform-specific integers”, like “int” is in C.

While this might have been an acceptable design decision 15 years ago for a v1 of the language on the dominant platform, C# now lives in diverse ecosystem, one where it needs to interoperate well with other runtimes and languages.   This is one of those things that just needs to be revisited.

Apple's APIs are both extensive and exhibit this issue, but they are by no means the only ones.
