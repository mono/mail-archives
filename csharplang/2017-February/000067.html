<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Xamarin had to introduce hacks like &quot;System.nint&quot; and &quot;System.nuint&quot; to
</I>&gt;<i> solve the problem in the world of Apple interop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we support operators for IntPtr and UIntPtr, then you won’t get
</I>&gt;<i> operators for nint and nuint.  It sounds like having a general operator
</I>&gt;<i> story might be a better idea that trying to continually bless specific
</I>&gt;<i> types in the compiler.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I would get them for free.   Let me explain why.

In C# &quot;int&quot; is a shorthand for System.Int32 and &quot;double&quot; to System.Double
and so on.

We would get the operator support in System.IntPtr, and if we get the nice
alias, we would just get them for free. [1]


&gt;<i> &gt; It is only tiny, because we have made it so cumbersome to use.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Xamarin had to introduce hacks like &quot;System.nint&quot; and &quot;System.nuint&quot; to
</I>&gt;<i> solve the problem in the world of Apple interop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can you give more data on this.  I’m familiar with coding for iOS, but I’d
</I>&gt;<i> like to know the cases where:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    1. Someone really needed to be using these types
</I>&gt;<i>    2. A solution that brought in operators through another library would
</I>&gt;<i>    not be sufficient.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They are used pretty much everywhere on iOS today, you can not escape it.
</I>  They are the NSInteger and CGFloat data types that you see everywhere in
Objective-C and Int/CGFloat on Swift.   Every one of those parameters on
UITableView is now an NSInteger.

Nowadays on iOS/macOS, it is very rare to find regular int32_t or floats.

Apple started a transition at some point where every API that had an &quot;int&quot;
switched to be an NSInteger and floats became CGFloats.   At the time, most
people -me included- thought that NSInteger was just Apple being cute.
 And then the 64-bit iPhone came out, and BAM!   There it was, Apple had
pulled the switch.

Cyrus - this has been a burning question of mine for months since I have
seen you on the internal mailing lists, but did you write an iOS app that
was a moving listing app?   Because I was a fan of that app.

Miguel.

&gt;<i>
</I>[1] Xamarin would still need to do some work to keep everything working -
cope with the fact that today we have System.nint, System.nuint and
System.nfloat and do something about existing assemblies referencing those
types, but that is something that we can do.
