<PRE>I would like to see the proposal as a diff against  §6 of the spec. Right now there are a number of ambiguities - for instance, what about lifted conversions?

Subject: Re: [csharplang] Operators should be exposed for `System.IntPtr` and `System.UIntPtr`

I assumed that the proposal meant operators where BOTH operands where either System.IntPtr   or System.UIntPtr .

The proposal should be clarified to precisely specify the set of operators in the C# language (along with clarifying issues about conversions and behavior with checked/unchecked). It isn't at all clear.

Subject: RE: [csharplang] Operators should be exposed for `System.IntPtr` and `System.UIntPtr`


Ø  This would still be a compile error under the proposal as submitted, because there is not an implicit conversion from type &quot;int&quot; to type &quot;IntPtr&quot;.

Could you please clarify? The proposal states:
The CLR supports a set of operators for the System.IntPtr and System.UIntPtr types (native int). These operators can be seen in III.1.5 of the Common Language Infrastructure specification. However, these operators are not supported by the C#.

That is to say, all operators defined by the runtime for System.IntPtr and System.UIntPtr should be implemented. The exact set of these operators is visible in III.1.5 of the CLI spec (ECMA-335).

A subset of that is here:
[cid:<A HREF="http://lists.dot.net/mailman/listinfo/csharplang">image001.png at 01D280C1.04CB4700</A>]

As you can see, it explicitly defines (IntPtr = IntPtr * int) and (IntPtr = int * IntPtr), as well as many others. There is no implicit conversion required, it is handled by the runtime provided you push both operands onto the stack and call 'mul'.

So, the code example you provided would be completely valid.


Ø  If we add an implicit conversion from &quot;int&quot; to &quot;IntPtr&quot;, then I'm pretty sure even fairly straightforward overload resolution could cause compile errors that used to compile without errors. Is this acceptable?

No conversion is required, you just push the arguments on the stack and call the IL instruction.


Ø  I'm unclear why this is an pressing issue NOW, when we've been doing native interop with 32- and 64- bit platforms for at least 10 years. Is it Xamarin? That would certainly be a great reason to make a change, but I don't quite understand if that is a driving reason, since Xamarin already solved this problem in a different way (adding a different type: Systen.nint, instead of using System.IntPtr). Does THIS proposal somehow solve a problem for Xamarin, or has that ship sailed long ago?

Miguel would be much better suited to answer this :)


Ø  And is it really so hard, or so slow, to write:
IntPtr Double(IntPtr x)
{ return (IntPtr) ((long)x * 2); }     // if you are truly pedantic, throw in &quot;unchecked&quot;

Yes it is. Additionally, to ensure that it behaves properly you have to either:

  *   Use unsafe code to do actual pointer arithmetic -or-
  *   Check the size of IntPtr and cast to (int) if it is 4 bytes and (long) if it is 8 bytes

Always casting to long is broken on 32-bit OS as it does not correctly handle overflows or underflows. It also takes up unnecessary space (an additional 4 bytes) and is slower (each add is two operations, multiplication and division becomes a bit more complex - the Intel and AMD optimization manuals have some great examples of just how complicated this can get and the perf hit that can occur).

Subject: RE: [csharplang] Operators should be exposed for `System.IntPtr` and `System.UIntPtr`

Is the feature really so trivial?

Is it intended that the following code should be allowed?

IntPtr Double(IntPtr x)
{ return x * 2; }

This would still be a compile error under the proposal as submitted, because there is not an implicit conversion from type &quot;int&quot; to type &quot;IntPtr&quot;.

If we add an implicit conversion from &quot;int&quot; to &quot;IntPtr&quot;, then I'm pretty sure even fairly straightforward overload resolution could cause compile errors that used to compile without errors. Is this acceptable?

IntPtr Double(IntPtr x)
{ return (IntPtr) ((long)x * 2); }     // if you are truly pedantic, throw in &quot;unchecked&quot;

My gut says you would be hard-pressed to write an example where the code using casts to and from long/ulong was significantly slower than this proposal, but it might be interesting to try.

Ø  I don't see how that's relevant.  As I mentioned already, the runtime has *lots* of special things.  We're not discussing the runtime here though.  We're discussing the C# language.  It has never been a goal of the C# language to expose all the special pieces of the runtime or to give direct access to all the capabilities that the runtime has.

The C# language is closely tied to the runtime. In fact, it is so closely tied that you can never not consider the runtime. There are plenty of proposals (good ones too) that we have had to say: &quot;This cannot currently be implemented because the runtime does not support or completely restricts this.&quot; A number of these proposals are still open because we think they would provide enough value that we should work with the runtime to ensure such features are possible. As such, we always have to at very least ask: &quot;Does the runtime support this?&quot; for any language proposal.

As for your three questions:

  1.  Is this a good idea?
Several people seem to think so. Additionally, the change is trivial enough (from a language perspective) that Mads has let me open a PR for the official proposal.

  1.  Are existing approaches insufficient?
Yes. That is what myself and several others have been saying. They are a pain to work with, make code readability/maintainability harder, and are not as performant as the runtime allows them to be (the runtime already has a minimal overhead way to do this, we are saying C# should support the minimal overhead way, rather than requiring the runtime to be modified to support a slightly less than minimal overhead way).

  1.  Are their better proposals we could take that would provide more value and which would then give us this as well?
That is the other point I have been trying to raise. The answer to this is mostly no, because this is a special type. Because this is a special type, you can only provide the equivalent functionality on types that the runtime considers special. This requires the compiler to be aware of what these types are and to know that it should emit a single IL instruction for the operations on that type.

We could probably augment this proposal to support any new primitive types added to the runtime. However, I doubt very many new primitive runtime types will be added (if any are ever added) and the cost of creating a mechanism to extend support in that way would likely be not worth the effort in the long run (due to the expectation that no new primitive types will be added, if any are ever added).

Now, if you look at this from the perspective of a general proposal to support adding operators to existing types, then the answer is yes. The proposal exists and has been partially implemented (at least in prototype form): Extension Everything. However, even with such a feature (at the very least making 2 less of a problem, since being a pain to work with and making code readability/maintainability hard go out the window) this proposal would still exist, since this an optimization that only the compiler can make.


Ø  It's like telling me &quot;VB should support pointers, because the runtime supports them&quot;.  Just because the runtime supports something does not mean that I believe it should be exposed from the language.

VB and C# are wildly different in this regard. Mostly because C# is the language of choice (and always has been) for the core framework. This means that if C# doesn't support it, chances of it being in the core framework drop (there are a some exceptions here and generally require the API to be written in IL). Additionally, C# does support pointers and is well known for being one of the best choices for writing interop code. This is one of the many ways that writing interop code could be improved even more, and if you want to bundle them all together into a feature and give it a name (like LINQ), then by all means do so.

But, most people aren't going to be writing a single proposal for a set of features or even trying to tie multiple features together into a bundle. People are going to be targeting a single issue and opening a proposal on that, to limit scope. The Language Design team is going to be the thing that needs to say all these features on their own look good, and we'll accept these ones if someone implements it and we'll take these ones on ourselves because we see a set of proposals that would work really well together in the next language version.
