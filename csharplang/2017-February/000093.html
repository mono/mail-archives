<PRE>As for what to do about defects in the specs that are current there:


*       It's still fine to raise issues on it, and

*       It's still fine to fix them.

When we have more permanent spec source, I will go back through the Spec-defect issues and pull requests here and make sure they are applied again, if necessary.

Thanks!

Mads

Subject: [csharplang] Specs in the csharplang repo

Hi all,

The specs in the repo are currently &quot;unofficial&quot;, in the sense that they are not the source for anything else, and they will eventually be replaced with something else. They were generated from Word by a tool to test our ability to faithfully represent the language spec in Markdown, and we chose to share it temporarily, because it is so damn useful.

Let me share the longer term plan.

ECMA is currently standardizing C# 5.0. Yes, that's a few versions ago, but it has been going on since C# 5.0 was the newest release, and it's taking a while because it updates all the way back from C# 2.0 (the intervening versions were never standardized).

When C# 5.0 is standardized (which is soon), I want to make two moves:


1.       I would like the ECMA spec to move to Markdown for its source (but that's not solely my decision)

2.       I would like to move the Microsoft spec to be based on the ECMA spec

If 1 comes to pass, as I hope, then when ECMA 5.0 is done, we can go through the following process:


1.       Port ECMA 5.0 to Markdown

2.       Put a copy of that in csharplang/spec

3.       Port my C# 6.0 spec additions onto the csharplang spec

4.       Designate this as Microsoft's official C# 6.0 spec (much delayed!)

5.       Submit it for ECMA 6.0

6.       Evolve it in place for C# 7.0

7.       Once ECMA's C# 6.0 standard is done, port in the improvements (they always make it much better)

8.       Designate this as Microsoft's official C# 7.0 spec (less delayed, I hope)

9.       Rinse and repeat

So in the ideal outcome here, ECMA and Microsoft specs are periodically sync'ed, all sources are in Markdown, and all MS spec work for new versions takes place in csharplang/spec.

Mads
