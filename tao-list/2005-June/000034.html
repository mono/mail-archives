Wow! Sounds like you're insanely busy, and could certainly use the
stress relief afforded by GTA/BF2. :)

I don't know what currently exists now, but such a busy schedule would
certainly encourage me to commit whatever code I had, even in an
unworking state (though perhaps as an unstable branch) so others could
see what exists and, perhaps, contribute to it, thus alleviating me of
some of the load and responsibility.

I think a few people here have mentioned having patches to contribute,
and I may have seen someone working on Tao.Sdl support on the Mono OSX
list. Have you considered setting up a trac somewhere?

Though I may not be able to help as much with the coding, I'd
certainly be willing to help maintain a trac instance, though
unfortunately I can't host it locally.

I think you're right. I'm fairly sure that the ODE &quot;unstable&quot; branch
includes autotools, so depending on how unstable/compatible it is, it
may be worth supporting that under Linux. I'll check with the ODE list
and report back as soon as I know something.

Tao.Ode is something I'd very much like to see fleshed out, and I'm
willing to do whatever I can to help with that. :)
