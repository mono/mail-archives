<PRE>Yeah, sorry, I meant to get it in this weekend, but between GTA:SA (love 
it), the BF2 demo (I loved desert combat for bf1942, I haven't given 
this much time, but I think it's a bit of a letdown), and house hunting 
(I think I finally found the one!  Though, no cable, the closest cable 
line appears to be 1.2 miles from the house, maybe I can get them to run 
it further) I didn't have time.  I'll try to get to it this week, but 
I've got to do the banking thing and whatnot to be able to put an offer 
down for the house.

As far as cross platform issues with ODE, the biggest is that it's a 
static lib on *nix.  I suspect it's reasonably straightforward to build 
a shared library for it though.  I don't believe there's any good way to 
deal with static libs in .NET and I doubt the mono folks have done 
anything in this regard either.
