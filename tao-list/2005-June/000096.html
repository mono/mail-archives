That's basically what I'm doing, though I'm still a toddler in the .NET
interop world so it's going slower than I'd like ...

&gt;<i> As far as noting the contribution, I've been putting them in the

</I>&gt;<i> boiler plate in the license.  cody == Sebastian Kotulla, I have his
</I>&gt;<i> email addy, if needed.
</I>
It might be worthwhile to send me the addy privately - I'll try to get
hold of Sebastian and find out what his preferred online contact info
is.  I was leaning towards the textfiles, since the Tao Framework Team
boilerplate in the code feels clean enough to me.  I think I'll follow
the tried and true OSS convention and throw an AUTHORS file into the mix
- that should cover things well enough.

&gt;<i> Here's the notes he sent me:
</I>&gt;<i> *snip*
</I>
Thanks - that's helpful.

&gt;&gt;<i> The code: There is one large class corresponding to the Ode class in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (the current) Ode.cs - this implements the bindings to the 'procedural'
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> part of the ODE api.  There are also several classes that wrap the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bindings to provide an OO interface to ODE.  The first thing I did is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pull out all the OO wrapper stuff into separate files and set them aside
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right, I'd seperatate out the OOP stuff as well, perhaps put it in
</I>&gt;<i> seperate namespace in the assembly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Good idea.  The situation seems loosely analagous to Tao.Sdl and
Sdl.NET, but since the parent Ode project has both the procedural
interface (which is what the bindings address) and the &quot;OO-wannabe&quot;
layer, one could make the argument that the OO stuff belongs in Tao,
rather than a separate project (like Sdl.NET).  [I'm assuming that
cody's OO stuff basically implements the OO part of Ode.  I really need
to study the Ode code.  Wheee! Yet another distraction.]

&gt;&gt;<i> mostly tedious grunt work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This isn't the most fascinating work, however, so I'm taking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it in small doses.  Note that I'm just shooting for syntactic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> correctness here (ie, it compiles cleanly) so the code will be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> essentially untested.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Welcome to my world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>:<i>-D       The dream is that eventually all this 'binding' stuff will
</I>fade into the background - they will become stable and everyone can
focus on implementing whatever cool thing that originally motivated
them.  I'm willing to endure some pain in anticipation of the cool stuff
that might be built on top of this.
