<PRE>Now that I seem to have gotten SDL working under OSX, I'm moving on to
OpenAL.

I'm experiencing some strange sound behavior. It seems as if all
sounds are sped up somewhat, perhaps as if the sample rate is being
incorrectly set. I've not encountered this issue under either Linux
or windows.

I remember reading here that OpenAL uses different constants on
different platforms. Is this true for OS X only? What else may be
causing this issue? As my code seems to work everywhere else, I'm
wondering if perhaps there are some implementation differences between
the OpenAL shipped with Tiger and all others.

Apple.com claims that they're shipping version 1.2. I'm assuming this
is the version of the OpenAL spec which they're supporting? I've been
digging around in the source for the Debian package and the source out
of CVS, but can't seem to find any indications as to which version I
have under Linux. There are version defines in the source, but I'm not
sure how to read their values as a human-readable version number, or
even if that is their intent.

Thoughts?
