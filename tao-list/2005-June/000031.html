Ewww, that's ugly! Had no idea the situation was *that* bad. :)

I somehow got it working today under windows with no
modifications. I'm not entirely sure how, though. The only thing I did
differently was to build the executable under windows rather than
copying it across from Linux, though I may be remembering that
incorrectly, too. No idea.

Can you give me any pointers about how to make something
cross-platform in instances where libraries differ, as is the case
here? I know that it's possible to use preprocessor defines and build
separate DLLs, but is there any way to evaluate certain snippets of
code only if the DLL is being used on a specific OS? I'm fairly new to
C#, so am still coming to terms with lots of this.

Thanks.
