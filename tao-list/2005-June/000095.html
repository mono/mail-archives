<PRE>Thanks, Dave.  That's probably not necessary, as I frequent the RF
boards and have mentioned this already.  It's easy to miss things there
since there are a reasonable number of forums, a decent amount of
traffic and multiple things going on (Probably good since I have already
mentioned a few things I would do there that have been on the back
burner since I got distracted by this).  Oh, and my online 'nick' is
different from my real name (long story - a combination of an inside
joke between friends and the desire to pick a nick that was fairly
unique so I don't have 'namespace collisions' with already existing
online names).  I seem to be the resident Linux advocate over at RF and
have mentioned that the managed C++ Ode they currently use isn't
suitable for cross-platform use (xeonx seems to have a pretty good grasp
of the current Linux situation).  Once I (and hopefully other interested
parties) beat Tao.Ode into shape, I'm going to pop back over to the RF
code and refactor it to use the new, improved Tao.Ode.   Sigh - perhaps
someday I'll finally work my way back to the the point where I became
interested in 3d graphics on .NET in the first place.  [To paraphrase
Jamie Zawinski:  (Opensource) is only free if your time has no value.]
