<PRE>I'm quickly running up against the limitations of my simple
System.Rectangle bounding box collision system, and think that perhaps
ODE might be the answer. :)

I hesitate to work on adding changes, though, because several of you
have mentioned already having patches and changes done, and I hesitate
to duplicate effort. Would anyone care to comment on what you've done
such that I can begin adding those things I need, without duplicating
effort? Then I can submit my own patches that actually make progress
instead of duplicating others' work, and can wait for the other
patches to be committed.

Again, I offer my willingness to administer a Tao Trac such that we
can publicly contribute patches and, perhaps, apply them ourselves
between commits. I may even be willing to host it locally at this
point, though if my understanding of Trac is correct, its subversion
features won't work without repository access (as opposed to access to
working copies), so the hosted instance would simply be a development
wiki/patch repository/bugtracker.

Or, if there's anything else that I might do to help facilitate
progress then do let me know. I'm still coming to terms with C# and
working with native libraries, so I can't help as much with code, but
I'd be happy to help in any other way that might be useful.
</PRE>
