<PRE>Hi all,

Since I believe communication is the lifeblood of FOSS projects, I get
irritated when communication is poor.  I thought I'd practice what I
preach and give a status update on the Tao.Ode stuff I'm working with at
the moment, now that I've had a chance to study it.

Background info:  I agreed to work up some Ode stuff that Randy Ridge
hasn't had time to deal with; the code arrived in the form of a single
large .cs file with little in the way of explanation (because we didn't
discuss it much and I didn't ask).  A comment block at the top of the
file identifies it as ODE bindings by 'cody'.  A little googling pulled
up a thread from the old taoframework.com site (gotta love that Google
cache) in which the aforementioned 'cody' mentions some ODE bindings he
has created - I assume that's what I have in my hands.  (Google search
terms: &quot;cody ODE bindings taoframework&quot;)

The code: There is one large class corresponding to the Ode class in
(the current) Ode.cs - this implements the bindings to the 'procedural'
part of the ODE api.  There are also several classes that wrap the
bindings to provide an OO interface to ODE.  The first thing I did is
pull out all the OO wrapper stuff into separate files and set them aside
for later.  The remaining code corresponds almost exactly to the current
Ode.cs file in SVN in an architectural sense - aside from stylistic
differences it's basically a superset of that file.  The 'code metrics'
utility in my IDE shows 41 methods in the old Ode.cs vs 335 methods in
the new file (each method representing a call to the underlying Ode
api).  Taking into account the overlap between the two files, this gives
us about 294 new methods, so post merge we'll have bindings to a much
larger chunk of the Ode api, if not all of it.

Current work task:  Merge the current ODE binding code with the new
stuff.  This involves mostly tedious grunt work since the code is
already written (cutting/pasting, refactoring, adding comments, etc.). 
Since this is a learning experience as well, some time is going into
reading up on .NET interop and looking at the 'native' Ode code.  I'll
post the merged Ode.cs file when I'm done so everyone can play with
it/test it.  I'd like to have this done by the end of the week if I can
manage it.  This isn't the most fascinating work, however, so I'm taking
it in small doses.  Note that I'm just shooting for syntactic
correctness here (ie, it compiles cleanly) so the code will be
essentially untested.

Future tasks: 

- Testing/verification of new code.  Hopefully a group effort.
- Work up the OO wrapper code that was set aside.  Since Chris Bacon is
interested in an easier-to-use OO wrapper to Ode, I will probably punt
that code over to him if he is willing. 

Cheers,

T.

[Side note:  I'd like to give proper acknowledgement, so if Randy or
someone else has more information on the identity of 'cody', I would
thankful.  Is there a preferred way to give acknowledgement for
contributions to Tao?  Should it go in a comments block after the
license section in each .cs file?  In the Class Documentation region of
the same?  AssemblyInfo.cs?  Text files (eg. readme files, an AUTHORS
file)?  Somewhere else?]
</PRE>
