<PRE>&gt;<i> Well, the original motivation for Tao was game programming related as 
</I>&gt;<i> I understand it, but I always thought that definition was a little too 
</I>&gt;<i> narrow.  My interest in OpenGL bindings was motivated by an interest 
</I>&gt;<i> in scientific visualization (the first OpenGL app I ever saw was a 3d 
</I>&gt;<i> protein structure viewer on an SGI workstation).  The Ode bindings 
</I>&gt;<i> could be used for physics simulations outside of games, though 
</I>&gt;<i> probably nothing hard core.   I could probably think of non-game 
</I>&gt;<i> related uses for the other Tao bindings as well.  I wouldn't mind 
</I>&gt;<i> tweaking the definition of Tao a bit to de-emphasize the gaming 
</I>&gt;<i> connection a bit (or more precisely to include non-game uses in the 
</I>&gt;<i> definition of Tao).  I wouldn't have a problem with your bindings 
</I>&gt;<i> being part of Tao, myself.  I'd like to see libflac bindings as well, 
</I>&gt;<i> actually.  The SDL bindings do provide access to libvorbis, but just 
</I>&gt;<i> for playback, I think.  Do your bindings provide support for encoding 
</I>&gt;<i> too, or just decoding?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I'm still in developpement with my bindings, but I've start with the 
&quot;encoding&quot;-feature because I'm already using the SDL playback and want 
to get away from these large wave-files(or the uncompatible mp3s). I'm 
interested in building bindings for libflac, but I don't really know 
much about the flac features. In relation to the game library ogg/vorbis 
could also be there very helpful for reading and converting the user's 
favourite music into the game. Of cause there there is not really use 
for them in the scientific area.
