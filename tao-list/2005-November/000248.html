</I>Hi Vlad,

I finally got around to creating some Gentoo ebuilds for the release 
files, and I encountered a few issues as listed below.
(Note:  This applies to the Mono version only - I haven't looked at the 
Windows binaries yet).

1.  The assemblies for Tao.Cg, Tao.DevIl, Tao.FreeGlut, Tao.Glfw, 
Tao.Ode, Tao.OpenAl, Tao.OpenGl and Tao.Sdl (all of them, in other 
words) do not have a strong name, so can't be installed in the GAC.  Can 
the assemblies for Tao binary releases be built with strong names by 
default?

2.  The Readme files and such for the various Tao packages aren't 
present in the binary distribution.  Granted, they don't contain very 
much useful information, but eventually they could (hint, hint), so I've 
been including them when making ebuilds.  Even meager documentation is 
better than none. 

3.  The name of the mono zip file (Tao-1.2.0-2-mono.zip) doesn't match 
the name of the subdirectory created when unpacked (Tao-1.2.0-1).  To 
facilitate ease of maintenance, Gentoo ebuilds typically refer to a 
variable based on the package version number to reference location of 
files rather than hard-coding the name in several places.  Moving 
forward, having the subdirectory match the name/version number of the 
distribution file would be helpful.  (Eg. Tao-1.2.0-2-mono.zip contains 
&quot;Tao-1.2.0-2&quot; - I don't think including the &quot;mono&quot; is necessary).  Note: 
This is NOT a big deal, so don't make too much of this.

4.  I made a few minor fixes to Tao.Ode in SVN based on a bug report by 
Rob Loach.  Next time the Tao distribution files are updated, please 
pull the latest Tao.Ode code from SVN so these fixes are included.  Much 
obliged.

Now that some &quot;official&quot; releases of Tao are available again, I'm aiming 
to get my Tao ebuilds added to Gentoo portage once I work out issues 
like the above and get them stabilized and tested.  IMHO, this might be 
a good time for any interested parties to consider putting together Tao 
packages for some other Linux distributions (Fedora, Debian and Ubuntu 
come to mind.  Oh, and SuSE, I suppose - grin.)

Thanks,

Terry
