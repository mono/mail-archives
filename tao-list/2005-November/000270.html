</I>OK,

I don't know how basic to go here, but based on the comments on the list 
from this message and the previous one, its clear some explanation is in 
order.

Windows XP 64 bit edition (Win64), and the other 64 bit variants, have 
two subsystems.  WOW32 runs existing 32 bit Windows applications, and 
WIN64 runs 64 bit windows applications.

WOW32 and WIN64 can only talk via the kernel, a WOW32 application cannot 
load a WIN64 dll, and a WIN64 application cannot load a WOW32 dll.  The 
two subsystems are separate but equal.

.NET 2.0 and later installs into both WOW32 and WIN64.  The 32 bit GAC 
can be viewed at %WINDIR%\Assembly.  The 64 bit GAC can be viewed at 
%WINDIR%\Assembly64.  Note you have to use explorer or another shell 
that knows how to load explorer's extensions for this to work.

Note that the JIT compiler will use x64 opcodes for both the WOW32 and 
the WIN64 version where it is appropriate.  You do not need to use the 
WIN64 version to get full performance out, and it is not even 
recommended (read Whats new in the Framework SDK 2.0 in the SDK 
documentation) -- it is recommended that for applications that need 2G 
or less of memory, that you use the WOW32 version of .NET.

The thing here to understand is your video game wants to maximize its 
use of the level 1 and 2 processor cache.  The level 1 cache is the only 
thing that runs even remotely close to the speed that your processor 
itself is running, and once you exhaust the processor cache, you are 
stalling the processor constantly, making it wait for data.  You do not 
want to stall the processor, so you want to make every byte in that 
cache count.

When you run in WIN64 mode, pointers consume twice the space.  Unless 
you are using at least 2G of memory, that extra space is all nulls.  
When you run in WIN64 mode, references to instances of objects double 
and handles double, too, and again the extra bytes are all nulls.  Every 
string has four extra bytes of nulls, every array...  All this space 
that you could be using for something meaningful.  The tables used to 
invoke methods double in size, too -- it spreads through the whole of 
your memory usage, doubling the size.

If you really want to run it in 64 bit mode despite all this:
1.  Create a .manifest file for each Tao DLL.  Redirect *32.dll that it 
references to *64.dll.  Alternatively, modify all references to *32.dll 
to *64.dll in the Tao source code itself.
2.  Obtain or build 64 bit versions of each of the native code DLLs that 
Tao wraps, including SDL, Devil, ODE, etc.
3.  Make a folder named &quot;Tao64&quot; somewhere on your hard drive, preferably 
not anywhere under %WINDIR%.  Open %WINDIR%\Assembly64.  Drag Tao.dll to 
Assembly64 and release it.  You can use GacUtil, also, but it is easier 
to drag it.  Note that the file is not actually copied, only a reference 
is added, and that this (as with GacUtil) is intended for developers and 
not end users (you should go through Windows Installer to add assemblies 
to the gac, so it can track everything that it needs to -- most 
installation utilities know how to do this properly, so you can use NSIS 
or whatever).

Once again though, if you aren't using at least 2G of memory, you don't 
really need to run in 64 bit mode and it will actually probably hurt 
your performance.
