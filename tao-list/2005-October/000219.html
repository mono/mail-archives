<PRE>I've been working on a set of GL controls that use Tao that are usable 
on Windows Forms.  I originally was going to use the SimpleGLControl but 
it didn't quite do what I needed.  The controls I'm working on detect 
for bad GL drivers (or lack thereof) and display a semi-useful message.  
Also available are attachable zoomers and scrollers for the GL Panel.  
Also, I want to add support for multiple contexts for when the control 
is spanning multiple screens.

Would these be all that useful to anyone else ?

</I>&gt;<i>they'd expect.  More complex app/engine authors are probably already
</I>&gt;<i>familiar with the OpenGL conventions, and changing it would confuse
</I>&gt;<i>them as well.  For newcomers to OpenGL using a .NET language, they're
</I>&gt;<i>already going to be thrown off base by the non-object-oriented design
</I>&gt;<i>of the whole thing, even with function overloads.  Telling them they
</I>&gt;<i>have to explicitly specify which method they're calling is probably
</I>&gt;<i>not going to be a deal breaker if they're already committed down that
</I>&gt;<i>path :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think a much better endeavor would be to create a very lightweight
</I>&gt;<i>.NET-y framework built on top of Tao (taking advantage of OpenGl,
</I>&gt;<i>OpenIL, etc.) that would provide a richer interface, but not go so far
</I>&gt;<i>as to be a full engine of itself.  Wrapper/convenience objects for
</I>&gt;<i>Textures, VBO's, GLSL/assembly Programs, Display Lists, state
</I>&gt;<i>setting/getting, etc., could all be very useful and fit in much more
</I>&gt;<i>elegantly into the .NET world, and could then be used by .NET engine
</I>&gt;<i>developers to avoid having to reinvent the wheel each time.
