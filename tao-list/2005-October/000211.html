<PRE>Hello,

I'm a graphics and game programmer, and my work has led me to take a 
look at Tao.OpenGL. For the most part, I'm quite pleased with it.

I'm just concerned that Tao is rooted too deeply in the naming 
conventions of the OpenGL standard, and I was wondering if their would 
be interest in an initiative to give Tao a more natural CLI/.NET look 
and feel? I don't mean something as extreme as say Managed DirectX, but 
instead just updating the naming conventions used by Tao to make it CLS 
compliant. As it stands, MSVC# 2005 RC1 with code analysis enabled gives 
a ton of warnings because Tao's names are not CLS compliant, despite Tao 
classes being flagged with the CLSCompliantAttribute attribute.

As an example of what I mean, I include the following code fragment (I 
apologize in advance if the list spooler wrecks the formatting):

*namespace* Tao.OpenGl {

*// Perhaps change the class identifier name Gl to OpenGL?
*[CLSCompliant(*true*)]
*public* *sealed* *class* Gl {

*    // Here, constants have the GL_ prefix removed and are converted to pascal casing
    public* *const* *int* DepthFunc = 0x00000b74;
    *public* *const* *int* Nicest = 0x00001102;
    *public* *const* *int* TextureGenS = 0x00000c60;
    *public* *const* *int* TextureGenQ = 0x00000c63;
    // ... more constants

    *// For functions, remove the gl prefix and type-qualifier suffix because we now have method overloading to take care of it
*    [DllImport(/&quot;opengl32.dll&quot;/, EntryPoint=/&quot;glTexGenfv&quot;/), SuppressUnmanagedCodeSecurity, CLSCompliant(*true*)]
    *public* *static* *extern* *void* TexGen(*int* coord, *int* pname, *float*[] argParams);

    [DllImport(/&quot;opengl32.dll&quot;/, EntryPoint=/&quot;glTexGeni&quot;/), SuppressUnmanagedCodeSecurity, CLSCompliant(*true*)]
    *public* *static* *extern* *void* TexGen(*int* coord, *int* pname, *int* param);

    [DllImport(/&quot;opengl32.dll&quot;/, EntryPoint=/&quot;glTexGeniv&quot;/), SuppressUnmanagedCodeSecurity, CLSCompliant(*true*)]
    *public* *static* *extern* *void* TexGen(*int* coord, *int* pname, *ref* *int* argParams);

    // ... more functions
}

}



The next step after that might involve grouping common constants into 
enumerations where it makes sense and updating the method signatures to 
use the enumerations. As an added bonus, with modern IDEs, this would 
greatly simplify working with Tao due to things like code completion.

There are two downsides I can see from changing the naming conventions, 
and that is a) it no longer becomes as close of an OpenGL implementation 
as it used to be, and b) people will have to spend a bit of time getting 
used to the new identifier names. Concerning a), I think it is important 
to remember that OpenGL was first designed back in the day when the only 
real programming languages considered worthy of OpenGL implementation 
were C and Fortran. Things have changed since then, with new programming 
languages and new development environments, and so there's no reason to 
let Tao be subject to the &quot;old methods&quot;. And concerning b), I think that 
programmers would quickly adapt to the new naming style, and it would 
pay off in the long run.

Anyway, what are your thoughts on doing this?

Thanks.
