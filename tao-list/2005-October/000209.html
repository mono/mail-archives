<PRE>Hi,

I'll have to completely agree with Stefan on this one, on all aspects. I
love the official builds along with all the compiled example programs. I
took a quick look at them the other day and was amazed with the amount of
content provided. Well done guys, this is really looking good.

Stefan also suggested hosting an official forum instead of a mailing list.
Although a mailing list is sufficient for communication, it doesn't provide
as much functionality as a dedicated forum. I have both bandwidth and space
available on my server if that's an issue, I know that Vlad has a nice
server going as well. Even Stefan was willing to donate some space on his
server. I just find a forum much easier to use and communicate with other
Tao users. It's been great for bug reports on the SDL.NET
&lt;<A HREF="http://SDL.NET">http://SDL.NET</A>&gt;front. But of course, this is only the suggestion of a
new Tao Framework
lover...

In other news, when do you think the official binaries will make the Wiki?
I've talked to one other member from the GameDev community and he also gave
the thumbs up on the release. He's using the Tao builds in a 2D OpenGL-based
graphics engine known as Vivid.2D (
<A HREF="http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/topic.asp?topic_id=351590">http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/topic.asp?topic_id=351590</A>). I
haven't really looked at it that long, but the documentation does make it
look pretty promising. When the binaries do make the wiki, I'll announce it
on the main page over at GameDev (<A HREF="http://www.gamedev.net">http://www.gamedev.net</A>).

Well, that's about it for now. Thanks so much for all the work put into this
so far...

Thanks again,

Rob Loach
