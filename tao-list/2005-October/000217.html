<PRE>Various proposals have been kicked around for making the OpenGL API
more .NET-y; I think that it could be useful, but I'm not sure how
much benefit it would provide.  Doing it using a postprocessor causes
difficulties -- Ignacio already mentioned that a few of the GL_*
defines aren't legal identifiers if you strip off the GL_, since they
start with a letter.  There aren't many -- I think it was 4-5 -- but
it creates an inconsistency if you have to remember to use GL_ on
those, or if you change the name to something else (e.g. GL_3D to
ThreeD).  Another issue is that if you strip the type identifiers and
create overloads, the postprocessor that spits out the functions will
have to get much smarter, since it's possible that it will generate
ambiguous overloads for two different functions in the same
type-overload group.

These are all solvable; some with manual work, some with making the
code generator smarter.  However, is it really worth it?  Most of the
usage of the OpenGL API directly comes in a few areas, such as
tutorials and engine back ends.  Newcomers will already have to
translate tutorials to C# or their .NET language of choice to follow
along; it would just add extra confusion if they had to mentally
translate names as well, since invariably something won't be what
they'd expect.  More complex app/engine authors are probably already
familiar with the OpenGL conventions, and changing it would confuse
them as well.  For newcomers to OpenGL using a .NET language, they're
already going to be thrown off base by the non-object-oriented design
of the whole thing, even with function overloads.  Telling them they
have to explicitly specify which method they're calling is probably
not going to be a deal breaker if they're already committed down that
path :)

I think a much better endeavor would be to create a very lightweight
.NET-y framework built on top of Tao (taking advantage of OpenGl,
OpenIL, etc.) that would provide a richer interface, but not go so far
as to be a full engine of itself.  Wrapper/convenience objects for
Textures, VBO's, GLSL/assembly Programs, Display Lists, state
setting/getting, etc., could all be very useful and fit in much more
elegantly into the .NET world, and could then be used by .NET engine
developers to avoid having to reinvent the wheel each time.
