<PRE>Hi,

I'm fairly new to OpenGL (and computer graphics in common) but I have a 
hobby-project idea that I wanted to start in the next couple of weeks... 
So here I am.

I wanted to ask here if there's anyone who has written a very simple 
3D-Engine and wants to share code. I want to make a &quot;Fleet Command&quot; or 
Harpoon in space RTS game so I don't need fancy graphics (at least not 
now *g*) but a decent simulation of a 3D environment (eg. a sector of 
space, a solar system, somtething like that) where a player can control 
its vehicles.

So I need some moving blips (small spheres for units/vehicles), 
navigational hospots (planets, circles showing planet paths and of 
course a sun). Even wireframe graphics would be ok for me.

So I would just want an interface to add all these objects and then 
manipulate them via code and mouse-events (drop down menus)...

Has anybody ever created such a small engine and is willing to share? 
Maybe one of you in interested in joining my efforts! :) Be my guest! *g*

My background: I'm a &quot;conventional&quot; programmer with a history in 
business applications and database design. Programming for about 20 
years now  who's never ever got the chance to do graphics! :)

Regards,
Stevie
