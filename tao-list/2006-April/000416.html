<PRE>Hello,

Now that I have a bit of time, I thought I'd jump into the conversation.

Although I've only recently jumped into the Tao League, I think I have 
worked with you guys enough to know that whatever happens, Tao will most 
definitely still live on.  My experience with both Dave and Terry in 
SDL.NET, OdeDotNet, and newly added Tao.PhysFs, have shown that both of 
you are very competent programmers and team leaders.  But confidence in 
the survival of the framework due to its team members and leaders isn't 
all that's needed with Tao, what is needed is something else.  Some of 
these issues have been mentioned before, but I'll just go over what my 
thoughts are:


Developers

Although the current system is good and stable, it is completely 
dependent on the head maintainer of the project.  One person is 
responsible for maintaining the developer list, adding new developers to 
a project that he isn't truly involved with.  It would be easier on not 
only the maintainer, but also the other developers to have the ability 
to let other developers add new people to the project.


Releases

The release schedule is another thing that is completely dependent on 
the head maintainer.  One big release comes when you, Vlad, have the 
time to make the release.  In order to speed up deployment of the 
projects, releases could be made independent from the entire project.  
That way maintainers could make releases of stable branches without 
having to wait for the next big Tao release.  But this also means that 
every project would be independent of Tao, meaning that every project 
may not have the same format as the rest of the framework.  Standards 
will have to be declared.

Another option is to have both systems implemented.  Have a major Tao 
release scheduled every two months or so by anyone who can afford to do 
a build and upload it as well as allow individual project maintainers to 
release their own project individually from Tao.


Website

Although this is only minor, I think it's still worth mentioning.  Many 
consider Tao's scope to be extremely small as it just provides low-level 
bindings, but this is untrue.  Tao has a huge user interest and this was 
demonstrated back when Tao has its own forum.  Giving Tao its own 
website would centralize Tao related content and give users more 
information about what Tao provides as well as what needs help, 
development-wise.

A forum might also be something that might need discussion.  Although 
mailing-lists are sufficient and provide a good communication tool and 
bring the discussion straight to your mailbox, they aren't that good for 
large discussion groups.  Having a dedicated forum would allow also 
discussions of different projects to be parsed into different forums 
(different forums for Tao.OpenGl, Tao.Sdl, Tao.Ode, etc.).  This is 
definitely something that might spark some interest among Tao users.


Well, that covers the key issues I have with the current system.  It's a 
shame that you don't have the time to maintain this, Vlad.  Although I 
won't volunteer to become the maintainer of the entirety of the Tao 
Framework (Terry and Dave are much more competent as maintainers then I 
am), I will volunteer to help out as much as I can to help move Tao over 
to whatever new system is implemented.  Whatever happens, Tao will live on.

Thanks a lot,

Rob Loach

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This sounds pretty good to me. It allows me to focus on Tao.Sdl :-). 
</I>&gt;<i> I hear ya.  Time and energy is in short supply for everyone,

</I>&gt;<i> energy and quality on the things we're focusing on.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> main concern is the build/release process. Someone needs to take 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ownership
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of how builds are done and who should do them. Like Terry, I only have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> access to the Wiki and svn, but no file uploads.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> That's one of the things we can work out as a group.  Then maybe a 
</I>&gt;<i> 'benevolent dictator'/Linus Torvalds type personality can focus on 
</I>&gt;<i> Tao-wide issues at a high level rather than focusing on the details.  
</I>&gt;<i> Should be an easy job &lt;snicker&gt;.  Any takers?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Some thoughts on the build process and other topics
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. Should we use autoconf? 
</I>&gt;<i> Oh lord, yes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Would this help make Tao become part of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distributions?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.  I'm concerned with Gentoo at the moment - a lot of convenience 
</I>&gt;<i> functions in portage rely on the presence of autotools.    And Debian 
</I>&gt;<i> Tao packages are using  C.J. Collier's Tao autotools.  I don't see any 
</I>&gt;<i> harm in formalizing this, for the non-Windows side of things at least.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Should Tao be released in one large package or should each part be in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> its own package? For Linux, having separate packages may be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> preferable, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> probably not on Windows and OSX.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> Being able to target specific parts at the build level would be 
</I>&gt;<i> useful  - this would make it easy to package the various Tao bits 
</I>&gt;<i> individually for environments where this is useful, but still allow 
</I>&gt;<i> building everything for creating a monolithic package for convenience 
</I>&gt;<i> on Windows.  I think for Linux the best approach is to make things 
</I>&gt;<i> easy for packagers of various distributions (in the case of autotools, 
</I>&gt;<i> something like &quot;--with-ode --with-sdl&quot; as arguments to 'configure'), 
</I>&gt;<i> but still provide a large package for download as a fallback for those 
</I>&gt;<i> who want it.  The current approach used for Windows (one large 
</I>&gt;<i> installer package) is nice, though I'm not sure how updates for 
</I>&gt;<i> individual Tao pieces would be applied.
</I>&gt;<i> Don't know much about OSX.  Anyone out there have any info to offer?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. What is the relationship of Tao with Mono? Would it be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible/preferable to be like GTK# where it is part of the Mono release
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but is also separately available?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> Something I've been wondering about, considering where Tao currently 
</I>&gt;<i> lives.  I would provisionally say &quot;yes&quot; to all parts of your 
</I>&gt;<i> question.  Assuming the &quot;Tao Philosophy&quot; is a reasonable and accepted 
</I>&gt;<i> approach, it would be nice if Tao became a conduit for native bindings 
</I>&gt;<i> of all sorts, and perhaps a preferred mechanism for gestating and 
</I>&gt;<i> producing high quality native bindings that could be considered part 
</I>&gt;<i> of the 'official' Mono ecosystem, available as part of a typical Mono 
</I>&gt;<i> install (or at least an official, but optional add-on).  But since Tao 
</I>&gt;<i> also aims to provide cross-platform bindings for multiple CLR 
</I>&gt;<i> implementations (including the not-to-be-ignored MS.NET community), 
</I>&gt;<i> separately available binaries would be a must.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * The Tao Philosophy:  A good Tao binding is a low-level, high quality,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> low level binding to a particular native library which sticks to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conventions and architecture of the library as closely as possible even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when these deviate from conventional .NET ideoms.  A Tao binding is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thin veneer over the native library that should feel comfortable to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> someone familiar with that library, and artifacts associated with that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> library (documentation, coding conventions, etc.) should be immediately
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> useful.  To provide an interface more comfortable to a developer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expecting .NET ideoms, a 'sister' framework can be created on top of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Tao binding which presents a more comfortable interface conforming to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> .NET ideoms to a user.  Examples of this are Tao.SDL/SDL.NET and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Tao.Ode/OdeDotNet.  This model seems comfortable to people I've
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discussed it with.
