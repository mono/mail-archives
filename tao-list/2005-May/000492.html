The problem with OpenGl is that System.Reflection.Emit is used to
build the Gl assembly, and when emitting the &quot;calli&quot; native call
instruction, linux/mono allows for &quot;Winapi&quot; to be specified, which
basically means &quot;use the platform native convention&quot;.  .NET, on the
other hand, throws an exception in S.R.E if you try to emit Winapi,
even though it's a valid part of the method signature.  I did some
tests last night using linux-built assemblies on Windows, and the 4-5
examples I tried seemed to run fine.  I'll do more extensive testing
later on tonight, as I've got everything building via makefile-based
system (including all examples).

For the Cdecl postprocessor, I should be able to make it work with the
mono toolchain now... I haven't looked yet, but monodis and ilasm can
now round-trip most things correctly, so I think it's just a matter of
tweaking some regexps to account for slight differences in output
format.

Also, I think I'm going to dispense with ILMerge -- none of the
cross-platform solutions worked out, due to bugs or other
compatability issues.  (Mono's Cecil should be usable for this task in
another 2-3 months, so hopefully we can start using it then.)  I think
for now we'll end up with Tao.OpenGl.Core, Tao.OpenGl, and
Tao.OpenGl.Glu, instead of just one Tao.OpenGl.  Is this going to be a
problem for anyone?  I realize having 3 separate assemblies is a bit
annoying, but hopefully it should be bearable to remove a dependancy
on a third-party build tool.
