Hi Randy,

Sorry, I've been pretty busy recently and I've not been able to connect to IRC.

The changes that I did are very simple. I first updated the opengl spec files, applied the &quot;spec changes&quot; and fixed some python parsing errors.

Then I also exposed the opengl entrypoints over version 1.2 as extensions. That's necessary, because the win32 opengl implementation does not expose them as dll entrypoints. I don't know if that can cause any problems on other platforms, but I think it shoudn't.

The Cg 1.4 API has substantial changes, so we have added support for all the new functionality. There's still some entrypoints missing, but I'm trying to automate the process by using something like the opengl spec files.

I cannot talk right now about our projects that use Tao, but I can at least say that we are using it for one of our tools that's not been announced yet. So, we need to keep Tao updated to the latest extensions and I have permission to contribute any change that we make.

I also like the renaming changes that you propose and sounds like it should be very easy to do. Is that something that's already done or that you are planning to do? I should also be able to do the same for the Cg bindings.
