<PRE>The directory structure looks good. The only thing I would change would be
that  the dist directory not permanently contain any items. Any docs, libs
etc should go into another directory: /doc, /lib, /bin etc. That makes it
very easy to do a 'make clean' - all you have to do is delete the dist dir
and you are done. This does mean that a build script would have to copy lib
and docs from their primary dirs into the dist dir. In practive this is no
problem though. I use this kind of directory structure for SdlDotNet and it
makes releases a lot easier. You can just zip up the directory to release
it for example.

Let me know when you want  me to jump in. I have started to work with
premake ot generate some make files. I am not convinced if it will work for
Tao though. Still have to see...

Hi Dave,

I was just going to send a message to the list about the build
process, but you beat me to the punch ;)  I agree with you on both
counts -- I'd definitely like to simplify the directory structure, and
also make it easy to build on both windows and mono/unix platforms.

For the directory structure, I was thinking something along these lines:

tao/
  src/
    Tao.OpenGl/
    Tao.DevIL/
    ..
  examples/
    ..
    NeHe.Lesson18/
    ..
  dist/
    lib/
    doc/
    bin/

The subdirs of src would contain all the bits relevant to that
particular library -- all he source files, the documentation/license
bits, the strong name files, etc.  For examples, it might be better to
introduce another level into the tree, something like a NeHe dir with
Lesson1, Lesson2, etc. subirs underneath... but it may not be
necessary.

Everything would build to the dist/ dir -- all the .dll and
.dll.config bits would go to dist/lib, all the examples would build to
dist/bin, and documentation and other stuff would go to dist/doc.  The
built &quot;dist&quot; dir would be what what's distributed as a binary release.

For the actual build system, I'd really like to have a vanilla GNU
make-based build system in place for linux/OSX (and windows, if cygwin
is installed), and a second one that can be used if GNU make isn't
available.  Including VS.NET Solution and Project files should cover
all of Tao users (since chances are everyone will have either make or
VS.NET available), but using premake instead of VS.NET might be an
alternative.  Depending on the format of the makefiles that premake
generates, we might be able to just include the generated makefiles in
the source dist..

I actually rearranged things (locally, not in svn yet) according to
the above dir structure and implemented the simple makefile build
system (with support for .net 1.1 and mono 1.1), but I really want to
fix the OpenGL library building issues before going forward with it..
I've been trying 3-4 ways to find a cross-platform way to merge the
generated OpenGL extension bits with the extension loader core into
one assembly and running up with problems in the tools. =/

Anyway, that's what I came up with in a burst of motivation last
night... I'm open to drastic changes or strong disagreement, so let me
know what you think!

</I>&gt;<i> * Simplify the directory structure. There are too many directories to
