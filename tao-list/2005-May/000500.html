<PRE>Hi Ignacio,

</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, I've been pretty busy recently and I've not been able to connect to IRC.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The changes that I did are very simple. I first updated the opengl spec files, applied the &quot;spec changes&quot; and fixed some python parsing errors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then I also exposed the opengl entrypoints over version 1.2 as extensions. That's necessary, because the win32 opengl implementation does not expose them as dll entrypoints. I don't know if that can cause any problems on other platforms, but I think it shoudn't.
</I>
Sounds good -- can you send me either a patch or the modified files? 
I'll get them into the svn repository.
 
&gt;<i> The Cg 1.4 API has substantial changes, so we have added support for all the new functionality. There's still some entrypoints missing, but I'm trying to automate the process by using something like the opengl spec files.
</I>
Same goes for this.. let me know when you're ready and I can get the
stuff into svn for you.  We may be able to just get you a svn account
as well, if that's easier (I'm assuming you don't already have one,
that is).

&gt;<i> I cannot talk right now about our projects that use Tao, but I can at least say that we are using it for one of our tools that's not been announced yet. So, we need to keep Tao updated to the latest extensions and I have permission to contribute any change that we make.
</I>
Very cool!  I'm looking forward to the announcement :)

&gt;<i> I also like the renaming changes that you propose and sounds like it should be very easy to do. Is that something that's already done or that you are planning to do? I should also be able to do the same for the Cg bindings.
</I>
I think we're planning to do it, since as Randy enlightenened me
yesterday on IRC, typing &quot;gl&quot; with IntelliSense enabled in Visual
Studio /really/ sucks right now.. you end up with a minute or two of
hard lockup while the popup list gets created, and then the list ends
up with a few hundred entries.

However, do we want to continue that trend to the other libraries as
well?  So we'd have:

Gl.glVertexPointer -&gt; Gl.VertexPointer
Cg.cgIsProgramCompiled -&gt; Cg.IsProgramCompiled
Al.alBufferData -&gt; Al.BufferData
Sdl.SDL_Init -&gt; Sdl.Init 
etc. ?

What should we do about constants?  We can certainly do, e.g.,
Gl.GL_VIEWPORT -&gt; Gl.VIEWPORT
but we run into problems with, e.g. Gl.GL_2D, since &quot;2D&quot; isn't a valid
identifier name.
There's also some constants and methods that would end up with the
same name -- GL_VIEWPORT and glViewport.  So maybe we should just
leave constants with the prefix?
There's somewhere around ~3000 constants, and only ~10k method
overloads, so we'd still have an intellisense problem there... 
personally I think everyone should just move to using emacs to
develop, and not have to deal with this IntelliSense business ;)
