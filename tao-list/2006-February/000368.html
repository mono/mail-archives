<PRE>Hi Jesse,

&gt;<i>  Over the last several months I've gotten a growing interest in the Mono
</I>&gt;<i> project. I've always been a fan of Blender, and I had noticed that there
</I>&gt;<i> weren't a whole lot of high end graphics API's on the .Net platform as of
</I>&gt;<i> yet. I had gotten the idea in my head to export the Blender scripting API to
</I>&gt;<i> Mono using much the same method that Blender already uses for Python,
</I>&gt;<i> therefore launching Blender into the .Net world. This benefits .Net
</I>&gt;<i> developers in general --and Mono developers in particular, by providing them
</I>&gt;<i> with an incredibly rich modelling environment. It also benefits Blender in
</I>&gt;<i> much broader way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  The Mono platform already supports Python scripts, so that all Blender
</I>&gt;<i> scripts written in Python are instantly reusable. Having the Blender API in
</I>&gt;<i> Mono also alows Blender to be scripted in any language supported by Mono,
</I>&gt;<i> such as C# VB and Java.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  The one who benefits most are developers. Imagine: A game development
</I>&gt;<i> company uses Blender for it's modelling. It's scripts are written in a
</I>&gt;<i> combination C++, Python and C#, which are compiled into managed CLI
</I>&gt;<i> bytecode, deployed and executable on any vm. The blend file format is
</I>&gt;<i> naturally portable already. The developer could write an entire game using
</I>&gt;<i> Blender and Mono and be able to deploy on any OS (Windows, Linux, MacOSX)
</I>&gt;<i> with a single distribution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I think there is sufficient cause for such a project to motivate it's
</I>&gt;<i> undertaking. I myself am curious enough about it in theory to at least give
</I>&gt;<i> it a best attempt.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  The purpose of my post was not for motivation since I'm going about it
</I>&gt;<i> regardless. I was hoping some developers more experienced with Mono could
</I>&gt;<i> give me advice on how to bind foreign API's into the CLI framework. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> aware that other projects (like Tao, Gtk#) are bindings of C code. I haven't
</I>&gt;<i> found any documentation about how to write the bindings.
</I>
That sounds like a great project!  There's a good amount of
documentation out there, e.g.:

<A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconconsumingunmanageddllfunctions.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconconsumingunmanageddllfunctions.asp</A>
<A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconmarshalingdatawithplatforminvoke.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconmarshalingdatawithplatforminvoke.asp</A>

Since I'm assuming that the blender API is a C API, &quot;Platform Invoke&quot;,
&quot;DllImport&quot;, and &quot;Marshal&quot; are going to be your best bets for search
keywords. The wrapping of a C API itself should be straightforward
(especially if you don't have to deal with function pointer returns as
with OpenGL); getting a .NET-looking object model around things is a
little harder.  This is why the Gtk# bindings are so complex; they
don't just provide a way to call Gtk functions from within the CLI,
but instead they provide a wrapper that reflects the gtk/GObject
object model into the CLI.

Good luck!
