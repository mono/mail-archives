<PRE>This post is in consequence of my last one about using the Blender Python
API to create a game engine framework for Mono

I have been browsing the Blender source code over the last few days and have
worked up some ideas how to go about this project. Specifically the portions
for binding the Blender internals to Python scripts has been very useful. My
intent is to reflect the Python interface as much as possible if only for
conventions sake. Since this is my first attempt at a Mono project I was
curious about a  couple of things.

I have read documentation about how to marshal native code using DllImport
and Platform Invoke, but examples I've seen only dealt with pure C code.
&gt;<i>From what I understand about marshalling it is not possible to invoke C++
</I>without either dealing with mangled names or by using an external tool like
SWIG. This in of itself is not a problem since I already presumed to have to
wrap the C++ portions in C code (the Blender sources do a fair bit of this
work already). In this circumstance would it be necessary to &quot;re-objectify&quot;
the C bindings with C# classes in order to get the object model?

Also, I'm already familiar with GObjects and how they incorporate object
oriented design into C as well as reflect in other objective languages. I'm
aware that Mono uses much of the GLib and GObject system, but how deep is
this relationship? Can I write the Blender wrappers in C using the GObject
system and have the virtual machine understand the object model from the
GObjects I create? Or am I totally misunderstanding the relationship?
