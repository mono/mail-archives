<PRE> Over the last several months I've gotten a growing interest in the Mono
project. I've always been a fan of Blender, and I had noticed that there
weren't a whole lot of high end graphics API's on the .Net platform as of
yet. I had gotten the idea in my head to export the Blender scripting API to
Mono using much the same method that Blender already uses for Python,
therefore launching Blender into the .Net world. This benefits .Net
developers in general --and Mono developers in particular, by providing them
with an incredibly rich modelling environment. It also benefits Blender in
much broader way.

The Mono platform already supports Python scripts, so that all Blender
scripts written in Python are instantly reusable. Having the Blender API in
Mono also alows Blender to be scripted in any language supported by Mono,
such as C# VB and Java.

The one who benefits most are developers. Imagine: A game development
company uses Blender for it's modelling. It's scripts are written in a
combination C++, Python and C#, which are compiled into managed CLI
bytecode, deployed and executable on any vm. The blend file format is
naturally portable already. The developer could write an entire game using
Blender and Mono and be able to deploy on any OS (Windows, Linux, MacOSX)
with a single distribution.

I think there is sufficient cause for such a project to motivate it's
undertaking. I myself am curious enough about it in theory to at least give
it a best attempt.

The purpose of my post was not for motivation since I'm going about it
regardless. I was hoping some developers more experienced with Mono could
give me advice on how to bind foreign API's into the CLI framework. I'm
aware that other projects (like Tao, Gtk#) are bindings of C code. I haven't
found any documentation about *how* to write the bindings.

I thank you in advance for any feedback.
