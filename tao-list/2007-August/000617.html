<PRE>(Resending mail to the tao-list).


SimpleOpenGlControl is Windows only (GetDC is a winapi call). The problem  
is that there's no Tao.Platform.X11 yet, although that will probably  
change soon (I have implemented bindings for X event handling, window  
creation and more, while Borrillis, of Axiom engine fame, has donated his  
GLX bindings).

There is a cross-platform alternative to SimpleOpenGLControl in OpenTK,  
which I'm intending to release as soon as keyboard handling works. The  
current release (0.3.8 - <A HREF="https://sourceforge.net/projects/opentk">https://sourceforge.net/projects/opentk</A>), which  
contains an early version of GLControl which can be hosted in an existing  
Form. What's more, OpenTK can interoperate with Tao.OpenGl (you can even  
mix OpenTK.OpenGL calls with Tao.OpenGl ones), so it should be possible to  
integrate with an existing project (if you are not averse to using  
alpha-quality software that is).

I can help you with any problems that may come up, so don't hesitate to  
post here, or at the (tao/opentk) forums.

Best wishes,
- Stephen A

I have some code that works fine under windows, and now another person is
trying to get it to compile under linux/mono.

This is what happens:
&quot;Unhandled Exception: System.EntryPointNotFoundException: GetDC
   at (wrapper managed-to-native) Tao.Platform.Windows.User:GetDC (intptr)
   at Tao.Platform.Windows.SimpleOpenGlControl.InitializeContexts ()

   at monoCAM.Program.Main (System.String[] args) [0x00000] in
/Project/src/Main.cs:13
&quot;

Is it possible to write cross-platform code that uses both winforms and  
tao?
how?
I notice I have a reference &quot;Tao.Platform.Windows&quot; in my project. should
that change to something else under linux/mono?

some googling suggests that OpenTK is better in this respect?
