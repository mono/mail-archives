<PRE>Hi - I'm back...

- I've tried using GLUT_STEREO option on glutInitDisplayMode but it does
not appear to work; on Nvidia Quadros, when OpenGL successfully inits
stereo mode, the emitter turns on. Not happening here and, of course, it
does not actually display the stereo render. Any thoughts on this?

- Alternatively, I have had some success drawing directly to a Windows
Form. I can indeed set PFD_STEREO despite the documentation's assertion
that it's not supported. The emitter comes on. I can render to both
buffers and it all appears to work. Sort of. As you are probably all
aware, the .NET Windows Forms engine is quite a bit different than what
was before. One thing is the need to access the hdc; the only place it
appears obtainable is in the object's Paint event using a function call
on the event object that is received. If I try to do *everything* within
the Paint event, I appear to run into trouble since Paint seems to get
triggered a lot???

I would actually prefer to use a .NET form vs. Glut as it will afford me
more control over the window. But any advice on either of these topics
would be deeply appreciated.
