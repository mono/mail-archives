&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This sounds pretty good to me. It allows me to focus on Tao.Sdl :-). My
</I>&gt;<i> main concern is the build/release process. Someone needs to take ownership
</I>&gt;<i> of how builds are done and who should do them. Like Terry, I only have
</I>&gt;<i> access to the Wiki and svn, but no file uploads.
</I>
Yes, this was my thinking when I was referring to an overall tao
maintainer -- the individual components should definitely remain
self-contained &quot;subprojects&quot;, I think, but there needs to be someone
to orchestrate the whole thing.

&gt;<i> Some thoughts on the build process and other topics
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Should we use autoconf? Would this help make Tao become part of
</I>&gt;<i> distributions?
</I>
I've resisted autoconf in the past, mainly because it's a pretty big
pain to maintain multiple build systems.  That said, though, on
windows, nothing short of MSBUILD will feel &quot;native&quot;.  So maybe the
right thing is to use autoconf as the default, and provide msbuild
files as well.  Another reason I've resisted autoconf is that there
just isn't that much to actually configure, other than providing an
automatic 'install' target and having --prefix work :)
But it might be time to bit the bullet and do so.

&gt;<i> 2. Should Tao be released in one large package or should each part be in
</I>&gt;<i> its own package? For Linux, having separate packages may be preferable, but
</I>&gt;<i> probably not on Windows and OSX.
</I>
It should be possible (and may be desirable) to do both.

&gt;<i> 3. What is the relationship of Tao with Mono? Would it be
</I>&gt;<i> possible/preferable to be like GTK# where it is part of the Mono release
</I>&gt;<i> but is also separately available?
</I>
It would definitely be possible; it would mean installing Tao
components in the GAC, but maybe that's not such a big deal.  I
originally viewed Tao as a set of components that app authors would
pick and choose from, and just ship with their app -- which is, I
believe, the preferred windows strategy, no need to put anything in
the GAC.  Mono takes a different approach, so maybe the GAC is
appropriate there.

In any case, I'd be happy to hand things over to you guys (David and
Terry) --- I never had access to upload files either, as it was mostly
a &quot;mail miguel/ben and they'll put it up&quot; situation, so I think svn
and wiki access is all I had :)  It might be good to talk to miguel to
figure out how best to prepare releases.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Howdy, Vlad -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't necessarily have bunches of time either, but I can step up and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; help &quot;keep the lights on&quot; while things get sorted out [Edit:  Work with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Dave Hudson to keep the lights on].  I'd need to get access to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; uploads area etc.  - all I can do now is edit the wiki.  But before this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; goes too far, this might be a good time for interested parties to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; discuss the future of Tao and how best to position the project moving
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; forward.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A few points:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - despite its origins as a games-oriented framework of native bindings,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in practice, Tao is probably better described as a loose confederation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of native bindings conforming to what I like to call the &quot;Tao
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; philosophy&quot; (definition below).  Games-relatedness is one aspect, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; many of the native libraries have other uses too, and many non-game
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; applications can be created in .NET/Mono using Tao.  I'm not sure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; finding a maintainer of &quot;the Tao whole&quot; is necessarily the best approach
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - unifying the maintainers of the various pieces of Tao around a central
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; core of guidelines might work just as well, and be easier to sustain.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - the various native libraries that Tao rests upon are more or less
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; independent of each other, move at different paces, have different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; issues, appeal to different audiences and meet different needs.  In the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; non-windows world, at least, the native libraries are often/typically
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; part of a web of dependencies that extends to other parts of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (operating) system and perhaps the Tao bindings should be more in tune
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with that reality.  Think of the various linux distributions and how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; most shared libraries are installed at the system level rather than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; locally.  They are generally involved in dependency relationships to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other libraries and applications in the overall context of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; distribution.  The dependency relationship between a particular Tao
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; binding, its native library, and possible .NET-based applications can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be/are closer than the relationship between the various Tao bindings.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The same holds true to a lesser degree for Windows, though the ecosystem
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is different, since most of the native libs are not part of the 'core'
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; windows platform.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - the various Tao bindings are currently maintained by different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; individuals rather than a single person and have different audiences.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So rather than having a single person responsible for Tao, maybe a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; better approach is to have everybody work together to define a set of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; guidelines and unifying principles that would qualify a binding to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; part of the &quot;Tao family&quot;.  Individual maintainers/teams would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; responsible for the different bindings and would maintain them and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; produce releases according to the dictates of their respective
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; communities and underlying native libraries.  This makes more sense to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; me than creating an artificial bottleneck in the form of a single
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; project maintainer who has to manage and decide on when to do monolithic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Tao releases.  It also makes it easier to deal with personnel issues -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when life circumstances change, it's easier to find new maintainers of a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; particular binding than maintainers of Tao as a whole.  Certain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; activities (adding .NET 2.0 support, for example) would require the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cooperation of the various Tao maintainers, so Tao as a unifying concept
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; still makes sense.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What is the general opinion regarding this kind of approach as opposed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the &quot;Tao as a monolithic project&quot; approach?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * The Tao Philosophy:  A good Tao binding is a low-level, high quality,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; low level binding to a particular native library which sticks to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; conventions and architecture of the library as closely as possible even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when these deviate from conventional .NET ideoms.  A Tao binding is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thin veneer over the native library that should feel comfortable to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; someone familiar with that library, and artifacts associated with that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; library (documentation, coding conventions, etc.) should be immediately
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; useful.  To provide an interface more comfortable to a developer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; expecting .NET ideoms, a 'sister' framework can be created on top of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Tao binding which presents a more comfortable interface conforming to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; .NET ideoms to a user.  Examples of this are Tao.SDL/SDL.NET and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Tao.Ode/OdeDotNet.  This model seems comfortable to people I've
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; discussed it with.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; It's becoming clear that I don't have the time necessary to do a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; proper job of maintaining Tao, doing the testing and release bits/etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  I already have way too many projects that I'm involved in at work,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and I'm about to start doing some OpenGL-on-the-web bits... leaving
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; very little time for Tao.  Is anyone willing to take over
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; maintainership of the Tao whole?  I'd still be happy to contribute as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; time permits, but I think that Tao overall is an important project
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (especially given OpenGL's new status as a first-class citizen under
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Vista, not to mention the revitalization by nvidia and ati, etc.) and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; it's a shame that parts of it are languishing.  I wish I was in a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; position where I could be actively using Tao in myday job, but that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; time hasn't come yet :)
