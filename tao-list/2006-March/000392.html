&gt;<i> Hello everyone, this is my first message on this list! :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have been writing an low level OpenGL binding for C#, wrapper and  
</I>&gt;<i> Toolkit in my spare time (which I will probably discontinue since Tao  
</I>&gt;<i> already does a good job), and I would like to ask how the OpenGL bindings  
</I>&gt;<i> are generated for Tao.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am asking for a very specific purpose: I would like to create a local  
</I>&gt;<i> source tree with a different naming convention than the one used in Tao.  
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is rather minor, but a significant one nonetheless: The OpenGL  
</I>&gt;<i> bindings in Tao use the Tao.Gl.Gl.glXyz() form, whereas in my wrapper they  
</I>&gt;<i> are called OpenTK.OpenGL.Gl.Xyz() (note that I've dropped the gl  
</I>&gt;<i> preceeding the Xyz() function, since it conveys no meaningful information  
</I>&gt;<i> in the era of namespaces). This difference might not seem as anything to  
</I>&gt;<i> worry about at first glance, but it makes the porting of my projects to  
</I>&gt;<i> Tao impossible!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would be very glad if someone could describe how the bindings are  
</I>&gt;<i> generated for Tao. I presume some automated tool is used (the warning on  
</I>&gt;<i> top of 'Gl.cs' for example indicates this - and yes I was crazy enough to  
</I>&gt;<i> have written the bindings by hand for my wrapper!) Is this program  
</I>&gt;<i> available in the svn repository? Or somewhere else?
</I>The Tao bindings are generated from a bunch of python scripts that you
can find the OpenGl directory of tao. The generation is done from the
spec files that come with the official opengl SDL I think.

On the subject, I also thought that GL.xyz() is nicer than GL.glXyz().
That's why I have written such a generator for myself as well :) It's
experimental and I currently don't plan to make an official release of
this stuff but if you're interested:

	<A HREF="http://www.stud.uni-karlsruhe.de/~uxsm/header2csharp.tar.bz2">http://www.stud.uni-karlsruhe.de/~uxsm/header2csharp.tar.bz2</A>

contains the infrastracture to parse a subset of C that is enough for
most header files. It successfully produces bindings if you feed it with
headers from OpenGL, OpenAL, SDL, FreeType along and maybe others (but
that's the one that I used myself). You can specify in a config file for
specialitites or C# specific code that should get generated. The package
also contains a OpenGl.cs with Xyz() naming scheme in the out directory.
Maybe this stuff is interesting to you.

Greetings,
	Matze
