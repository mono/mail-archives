<PRE>Hi all,

This sounds pretty good to me. It allows me to focus on Tao.Sdl :-). My
main concern is the build/release process. Someone needs to take ownership
of how builds are done and who should do them. Like Terry, I only have
access to the Wiki and svn, but no file uploads.

Some thoughts on the build process and other topics

1. Should we use autoconf? Would this help make Tao become part of
distributions?
2. Should Tao be released in one large package or should each part be in
its own package? For Linux, having separate packages may be preferable, but
probably not on Windows and OSX.
3. What is the relationship of Tao with Mono? Would it be
possible/preferable to be like GTK# where it is part of the Mono release
but is also separately available?

Dave

&gt;<i> Howdy, Vlad -

</I>&gt;<i> I don't necessarily have bunches of time either, but I can step up and
</I>&gt;<i> help &quot;keep the lights on&quot; while things get sorted out [Edit:  Work with
</I>&gt;<i> Dave Hudson to keep the lights on].  I'd need to get access to the
</I>&gt;<i> uploads area etc.  - all I can do now is edit the wiki.  But before this
</I>&gt;<i> goes too far, this might be a good time for interested parties to
</I>&gt;<i> discuss the future of Tao and how best to position the project moving
</I>&gt;<i> forward.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A few points:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - despite its origins as a games-oriented framework of native bindings,
</I>&gt;<i> in practice, Tao is probably better described as a loose confederation
</I>&gt;<i> of native bindings conforming to what I like to call the &quot;Tao
</I>&gt;<i> philosophy&quot; (definition below).  Games-relatedness is one aspect, but
</I>&gt;<i> many of the native libraries have other uses too, and many non-game
</I>&gt;<i> applications can be created in .NET/Mono using Tao.  I'm not sure
</I>&gt;<i> finding a maintainer of &quot;the Tao whole&quot; is necessarily the best approach
</I>&gt;<i> - unifying the maintainers of the various pieces of Tao around a central
</I>&gt;<i> core of guidelines might work just as well, and be easier to sustain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - the various native libraries that Tao rests upon are more or less
</I>&gt;<i> independent of each other, move at different paces, have different
</I>&gt;<i> issues, appeal to different audiences and meet different needs.  In the
</I>&gt;<i> non-windows world, at least, the native libraries are often/typically
</I>&gt;<i> part of a web of dependencies that extends to other parts of the
</I>&gt;<i> (operating) system and perhaps the Tao bindings should be more in tune
</I>&gt;<i> with that reality.  Think of the various linux distributions and how
</I>&gt;<i> most shared libraries are installed at the system level rather than
</I>&gt;<i> locally.  They are generally involved in dependency relationships to
</I>&gt;<i> other libraries and applications in the overall context of the
</I>&gt;<i> distribution.  The dependency relationship between a particular Tao
</I>&gt;<i> binding, its native library, and possible .NET-based applications can
</I>&gt;<i> be/are closer than the relationship between the various Tao bindings.
</I>&gt;<i> The same holds true to a lesser degree for Windows, though the ecosystem
</I>&gt;<i> is different, since most of the native libs are not part of the 'core'
</I>&gt;<i> windows platform.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - the various Tao bindings are currently maintained by different
</I>&gt;<i> individuals rather than a single person and have different audiences.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So rather than having a single person responsible for Tao, maybe a
</I>&gt;<i> better approach is to have everybody work together to define a set of
</I>&gt;<i> guidelines and unifying principles that would qualify a binding to be
</I>&gt;<i> part of the &quot;Tao family&quot;.  Individual maintainers/teams would be
</I>&gt;<i> responsible for the different bindings and would maintain them and
</I>&gt;<i> produce releases according to the dictates of their respective
</I>&gt;<i> communities and underlying native libraries.  This makes more sense to
</I>&gt;<i> me than creating an artificial bottleneck in the form of a single
</I>&gt;<i> project maintainer who has to manage and decide on when to do monolithic
</I>&gt;<i> Tao releases.  It also makes it easier to deal with personnel issues -
</I>&gt;<i> when life circumstances change, it's easier to find new maintainers of a
</I>&gt;<i> particular binding than maintainers of Tao as a whole.  Certain
</I>&gt;<i> activities (adding .NET 2.0 support, for example) would require the
</I>&gt;<i> cooperation of the various Tao maintainers, so Tao as a unifying concept
</I>&gt;<i> still makes sense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is the general opinion regarding this kind of approach as opposed
</I>&gt;<i> to the &quot;Tao as a monolithic project&quot; approach?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * The Tao Philosophy:  A good Tao binding is a low-level, high quality,
</I>&gt;<i> low level binding to a particular native library which sticks to the
</I>&gt;<i> conventions and architecture of the library as closely as possible even
</I>&gt;<i> when these deviate from conventional .NET ideoms.  A Tao binding is a
</I>&gt;<i> thin veneer over the native library that should feel comfortable to
</I>&gt;<i> someone familiar with that library, and artifacts associated with that
</I>&gt;<i> library (documentation, coding conventions, etc.) should be immediately
</I>&gt;<i> useful.  To provide an interface more comfortable to a developer
</I>&gt;<i> expecting .NET ideoms, a 'sister' framework can be created on top of the
</I>&gt;<i> Tao binding which presents a more comfortable interface conforming to
</I>&gt;<i> .NET ideoms to a user.  Examples of this are Tao.SDL/SDL.NET and
</I>&gt;<i> Tao.Ode/OdeDotNet.  This model seems comfortable to people I've
</I>&gt;<i> discussed it with.
