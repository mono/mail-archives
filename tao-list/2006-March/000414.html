&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This sounds pretty good to me. It allows me to focus on Tao.Sdl :-). 
</I>I hear ya.  Time and energy is in short supply for everyone, 
particularly when dipping your toes in the waters of multiple projects.  
The &quot;Many hands makes light work&quot; approach means more time, energy and 
quality on the things we're focusing on.
&gt;<i> My
</I>&gt;<i> main concern is the build/release process. Someone needs to take ownership
</I>&gt;<i> of how builds are done and who should do them. Like Terry, I only have
</I>&gt;<i> access to the Wiki and svn, but no file uploads.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>That's one of the things we can work out as a group.  Then maybe a 
'benevolent dictator'/Linus Torvalds type personality can focus on 
Tao-wide issues at a high level rather than focusing on the details.  
Should be an easy job &lt;snicker&gt;.  Any takers?
&gt;<i> Some thoughts on the build process and other topics
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Should we use autoconf? 
</I>Oh lord, yes.
&gt;<i> Would this help make Tao become part of
</I>&gt;<i> distributions?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Yes.  I'm concerned with Gentoo at the moment - a lot of convenience 
functions in portage rely on the presence of autotools.    And Debian 
Tao packages are using  C.J. Collier's Tao autotools.  I don't see any 
harm in formalizing this, for the non-Windows side of things at least.
&gt;<i> 2. Should Tao be released in one large package or should each part be in
</I>&gt;<i> its own package? For Linux, having separate packages may be preferable, but
</I>&gt;<i> probably not on Windows and OSX.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Being able to target specific parts at the build level would be useful  
- this would make it easy to package the various Tao bits individually 
for environments where this is useful, but still allow building 
everything for creating a monolithic package for convenience on 
Windows.  I think for Linux the best approach is to make things easy for 
packagers of various distributions (in the case of autotools, something 
like &quot;--with-ode --with-sdl&quot; as arguments to 'configure'), but still 
provide a large package for download as a fallback for those who want 
it.  The current approach used for Windows (one large installer package) 
is nice, though I'm not sure how updates for individual Tao pieces would 
be applied.
Don't know much about OSX.  Anyone out there have any info to offer?
&gt;<i> 3. What is the relationship of Tao with Mono? Would it be
</I>&gt;<i> possible/preferable to be like GTK# where it is part of the Mono release
</I>&gt;<i> but is also separately available?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Something I've been wondering about, considering where Tao currently 
lives.  I would provisionally say &quot;yes&quot; to all parts of your question.  
Assuming the &quot;Tao Philosophy&quot; is a reasonable and accepted approach, it 
would be nice if Tao became a conduit for native bindings of all sorts, 
and perhaps a preferred mechanism for gestating and producing high 
quality native bindings that could be considered part of the 'official' 
Mono ecosystem, available as part of a typical Mono install (or at least 
an official, but optional add-on).  But since Tao also aims to provide 
cross-platform bindings for multiple CLR implementations (including the 
not-to-be-ignored MS.NET community), separately available binaries would 
be a must.

* The Tao Philosophy:  A good Tao binding is a low-level, high quality,
&gt;<i> low level binding to a particular native library which sticks to the
</I>&gt;<i> conventions and architecture of the library as closely as possible even
</I>&gt;<i> when these deviate from conventional .NET ideoms.  A Tao binding is a
</I>&gt;<i> thin veneer over the native library that should feel comfortable to
</I>&gt;<i> someone familiar with that library, and artifacts associated with that
</I>&gt;<i> library (documentation, coding conventions, etc.) should be immediately
</I>&gt;<i> useful.  To provide an interface more comfortable to a developer
</I>&gt;<i> expecting .NET ideoms, a 'sister' framework can be created on top of the
</I>&gt;<i> Tao binding which presents a more comfortable interface conforming to
</I>&gt;<i> .NET ideoms to a user.  Examples of this are Tao.SDL/SDL.NET and
</I>&gt;<i> Tao.Ode/OdeDotNet.  This model seems comfortable to people I've
</I>&gt;<i> discussed it with.
