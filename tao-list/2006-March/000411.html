<PRE>Howdy, Vlad -

I don't necessarily have bunches of time either, but I can step up and 
help &quot;keep the lights on&quot; while things get sorted out [Edit:  Work with 
Dave Hudson to keep the lights on].  I'd need to get access to the 
uploads area etc.  - all I can do now is edit the wiki.  But before this 
goes too far, this might be a good time for interested parties to 
discuss the future of Tao and how best to position the project moving 
forward.

A few points:

- despite its origins as a games-oriented framework of native bindings, 
in practice, Tao is probably better described as a loose confederation 
of native bindings conforming to what I like to call the &quot;Tao 
philosophy&quot; (definition below).  Games-relatedness is one aspect, but 
many of the native libraries have other uses too, and many non-game 
applications can be created in .NET/Mono using Tao.  I'm not sure 
finding a maintainer of &quot;the Tao whole&quot; is necessarily the best approach 
- unifying the maintainers of the various pieces of Tao around a central 
core of guidelines might work just as well, and be easier to sustain.

- the various native libraries that Tao rests upon are more or less 
independent of each other, move at different paces, have different 
issues, appeal to different audiences and meet different needs.  In the 
non-windows world, at least, the native libraries are often/typically 
part of a web of dependencies that extends to other parts of the 
(operating) system and perhaps the Tao bindings should be more in tune 
with that reality.  Think of the various linux distributions and how 
most shared libraries are installed at the system level rather than 
locally.  They are generally involved in dependency relationships to 
other libraries and applications in the overall context of the 
distribution.  The dependency relationship between a particular Tao 
binding, its native library, and possible .NET-based applications can 
be/are closer than the relationship between the various Tao bindings.  
The same holds true to a lesser degree for Windows, though the ecosystem 
is different, since most of the native libs are not part of the 'core' 
windows platform.

- the various Tao bindings are currently maintained by different 
individuals rather than a single person and have different audiences.

So rather than having a single person responsible for Tao, maybe a 
better approach is to have everybody work together to define a set of 
guidelines and unifying principles that would qualify a binding to be 
part of the &quot;Tao family&quot;.  Individual maintainers/teams would be 
responsible for the different bindings and would maintain them and 
produce releases according to the dictates of their respective 
communities and underlying native libraries.  This makes more sense to 
me than creating an artificial bottleneck in the form of a single 
project maintainer who has to manage and decide on when to do monolithic 
Tao releases.  It also makes it easier to deal with personnel issues - 
when life circumstances change, it's easier to find new maintainers of a 
particular binding than maintainers of Tao as a whole.  Certain 
activities (adding .NET 2.0 support, for example) would require the 
cooperation of the various Tao maintainers, so Tao as a unifying concept 
still makes sense.

What is the general opinion regarding this kind of approach as opposed 
to the &quot;Tao as a monolithic project&quot; approach?

* The Tao Philosophy:  A good Tao binding is a low-level, high quality, 
low level binding to a particular native library which sticks to the 
conventions and architecture of the library as closely as possible even 
when these deviate from conventional .NET ideoms.  A Tao binding is a 
thin veneer over the native library that should feel comfortable to 
someone familiar with that library, and artifacts associated with that 
library (documentation, coding conventions, etc.) should be immediately 
useful.  To provide an interface more comfortable to a developer 
expecting .NET ideoms, a 'sister' framework can be created on top of the 
Tao binding which presents a more comfortable interface conforming to 
.NET ideoms to a user.  Examples of this are Tao.SDL/SDL.NET and 
Tao.Ode/OdeDotNet.  This model seems comfortable to people I've 
discussed it with.
