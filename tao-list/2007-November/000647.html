   It usually takes between 2 days and 2 weeks, depending on the
availability of the FTP masters in charge of reviewing new packages.

   I know the SVN snapshot I have been using is not very recent, but
it's the version we have been using at work and I didn't want to send
anything that had not been somewhat used before. But when the first
package is validated, I will switch to more frequent uploads.

&gt;<i> I think the next step for the Tao SVN is to drop prebuild and incorporate

</I>&gt;<i> /debian directory will not be directory incorporated into the Tao SVN, but
</I>&gt;<i> it would be nice to have the makefiles in there.

   I am not yet finished with autotoolising Tao, but I'll yet you know
about my progress.

Cheers,
