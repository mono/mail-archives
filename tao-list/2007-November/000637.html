   I personally don't care much where the Debian packaging is made as
long as I have write access :-)  However, since there are many people in
the Debian Mono packaging team[1], it could be impractical to have the
main packaging area in a repository where the rest of the team cannot
commit.

   If you think however that the packaging information can benefit other
Tao users, then I see no problem with copying the information to the
Mono SVN, except that if someone makes a modification to the Debian tree
I may not notice it immediately and the synchronisation will be delayed.
Also I may disagree with a modification that is made to the Mono tree
that I would not wish to merge back into the Debian tree, which would be
another cause of desync.

   Another solution is to use the svn:external property. That ensures
that the debian/ directory is visible to Tao SVN users and that they are
always in sync.

&gt;<i> I figure that would give them some extra visibility to the rest of
</I>&gt;<i> the Tao team. We can also get you added as a developer. Should these files
</I>&gt;<i> be checked in under a tao/debian directory?
</I>
   I'd be very happy to become a developer, all the more because I have
yet unapplied patches for gtkglarea-sharp, although I am not sure what
the policy is for cross-project commit rules.

   As for the debian/ directory, it's your call: I don't mind any way.
The distribution packager's work will be easened anyway when I have some
working autotools solution, though.

&gt;<i> Thanks for all of your work on this. It will be great to get an autotool
</I>&gt;<i> build and a debian package.
</I>
   You're welcome. It's not totally altruistic though: my company really
needs Tao to work and to easily build everywhere :-)

Cheers,

Sam.
