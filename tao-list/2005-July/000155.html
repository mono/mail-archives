<PRE>Great work.  Sorry I didnt check out the copy you sent me earlier but
I have been a bit sick lately.  Hopefully soon we will have OPAL.NET
and RealmForge to test out all of the functionality for in an actual
game.

I know that you wish to maintain a style similar to that of the prior
Tao.ODE version and the ODE docs, however I like the enums approach
that you have in the code but commented out.  It will allow strongly
typing of the methods, though not in the same way as the same hacky
struct-pointer approach.  It will also help out with
intellisense/code-completion and could prevent a lot of mistakes. If
you do decide to use enums, I would suggest not nesting them within
the class but just within the namespace however.  However that is
IMHO, so i would like to hear what others thing of it??  Either way, I
think that your style, though not C#-ish (as you put it =) is the best
choice for ease-of-maintenance since it mirrors the native ODE library
quite well and it doesn't matter too much either way as there will
soon be a higher level physics layer with OPAL.NET.

All-in-all, its a really great job and is far more complete then it
was before, making Tao.ODE as viable a solution as the different
C++.NET ports of ODE as well as the only cross-platform solution.  I
know that the work is quite tedious, so thanks a lot I appreciate all
the time and hard work invested in it and am sure that many others
will as well.

Now that you have completed the core of the work (though a few tweaks
or additions may occur from your or others as it becomes more heavily
used) will you take a break straight-away from coding or are you
interested in something more creative such as developing a
higher-level physics abstraction library.  It will be in a C#-ish
style and will require design and creativity as opposed to just a
straight port or wrapper and there will be fun interactive demos for
it.  I would think that you would enjoy working with us! What are your
immediate plans?

&gt;<i> Hello all,

</I>&gt;<i> It's time to resist the &quot;just one more thing&quot; voice and just let go. :-)

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One question - how to do the update?  The code is a more or less a

</I>&gt;<i> tested a 'drop-in' on a pristine Tao SVN tree and OdeExamples.Basic only

</I>&gt;<i> minimal.  As such, I'm inclined to just update Ode.cs on the main
</I>&gt;<i> trunk.  The alternative is to create a branch to let folks test things
</I>&gt;<i> first, then move to the trunk when ok.  Let me know.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Comments/Issues
</I>&gt;<i> ---------------
</I>&gt;<i> This code is a cleaned-up version of ODE bindings previously submitted
</I>&gt;<i> to Randy Ridge by 'cody', so wasn't written from scratch.  As such, I
</I>&gt;<i> resisted making any gratuitous changes to the code - I tried to leave
</I>&gt;<i> the original style intact.  So if anything bothers you or looks funny,
</I>&gt;<i> keep this in mind.  The naming convention used is that of ODE - if you
</I>&gt;<i> are reading through the ODE docs or an example on a
</I>&gt;<i> mailinglist/forum/wiki, everything will look very familiar, though not
</I>&gt;<i> very C#ish.  I spent a lot of time checking everything against the ODE
</I>&gt;<i> API making sure everything seemed right and organizing everything to
</I>&gt;<i> follow the general flow of the ODE documentation.  Cleanups were made
</I>&gt;<i> where necessary and missing things added.  I also added XML docs to just
</I>&gt;<i> about everything (mostly pulled from the online ODE docs and the code) -
</I>&gt;<i> this took the most time.  I'm not using Visual Studio, so my not have
</I>&gt;<i> the formatting exactly right.  Overall, I tried to end up with code that
</I>&gt;<i> was well organized and so easy to work with moving forward.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Don't expect everything to work. Simple tests run fine, but there is a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of code that isn't tested.  I'm not a P/Invoke expert, so while the
</I>&gt;<i> simple stuff is probably right, there are probably places where the
</I>&gt;<i> bindings are broken or can be improved or tweaked, so be on the lookout
</I>&gt;<i> for those.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Coverage of the public ODE API should be complete or near-complete in
</I>&gt;<i> the updated bindings.  I didn't actually count or anything like that,
</I>&gt;<i> but it certainly seemed as if I looked at just about everything in the
</I>&gt;<i> docs and Ode header files.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Major issue:  Currently the bindings are for the single-precision
</I>&gt;<i> version of the Ode library only - running against the double precision
</I>&gt;<i> version results in segfaults, at least on Linux.  There is an alias
</I>&gt;<i> corresponding to the dReal ODE datatype that's set to System.Single - in
</I>&gt;<i> theory a double precision version of the bindings can be produced by
</I>&gt;<i> changing the alias to System.Double and recompiling.  Not tested.
</I>&gt;<i> Figuring out how best to deal with the fact that the ODE lib can be
</I>&gt;<i> present in multiple precisions will be a big issue moving forward.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Testing
</I>&gt;<i> -------
</I>&gt;<i> No extensive tests were done, but simple tests work, both on windows and
</I>&gt;<i> linux.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - OdeExamples.Basic produces identical results with both old and new
</I>&gt;<i> versions of the bindings.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - I banged out some custom test code based on test_ode.cpp (from ODE
</I>&gt;<i> source) to test mass functions.  The tests I implemented pass or fail
</I>&gt;<i> similarly to the native version.
</I>&gt;<i> (dMassSetCappedCylinder fails in both cases - don't know whether this is
</I>&gt;<i> deliberate or a problem with the original code, but it's at least
</I>&gt;<i> consistent.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>
