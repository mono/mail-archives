<PRE>Hi Dan,

</I>One and the same.

&gt;<i>when will your changes to ODE be committed? 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Heh - you know better than to ask that question.   :-)  
Last week - that's when I wanted to be finished, but Real Life has an
annoying tendency to get in the way.  The correct answer is probably the
classic one: &quot;When it's done.&quot;  It should be weeks rather than months -
now that I've got things functioning on Linux where all my tools are.
 
It's a bigger job than I originally thought even though I'm not having
to write most of the code from scratch.  I'm checking every method
against the actual ODE code, comparing to the original Tao.Ode where
there is overlap, branching off now and then to read up on .NET interop
when I need to *and* reading the ODE userguide describing the code I'm
looking at.  That adds up to much bouncing around between windows and
not so much typing.  I also decided to start porting test_ode.cpp (part
of the ODE source) to C# so I have some assurance that the bindings are
working (so far they are).

Currently all the Mass functions
(<A HREF="http://ode.org/ode-latest-userguide.html#sec_9_2_0">http://ode.org/ode-latest-userguide.html#sec_9_2_0</A>) are done and
partially verified with the test code mentioned above.  The plan is to
tackle the following, roughly in this order:  the world functions, the
rigid body functions, the joint functions, the geom functions, the
collision detection functions, the space functions and the trimesh
functions.  Now that I've got a rhythm going, I'm hoping for steady
progress, slow though it may be.

As mentioned in a previous post, the plan at the moment is to plough
through everything, get the basic bindings done, then post everything at
once.  If it's clear that it's just going to take time, I may try to
define some logical 'chunks' of functionality (probably the functional
categories mentioned above) and post those as I finish them.  Just so
people don't have to wait too long and can have something to play with.

&gt;<i>Also is the perf/precision trade off for single
</I>&gt;<i>vs. double precision significant? 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Haven't tested this, but probably yes.  The ODE docs say what you might
expect:  &quot;The ODE library can be built to use either single or double
precision floating point numbers. Single precision is faster and uses
less memory, but the simulation will have more numerical error that can
result in visible problems. You will get less accuracy and stability
with single precision.&quot;

&gt;<i>Has there been any benchmarks of this?  
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>A quick google turns up nothing.  This information might be available
from the ODE community.

&gt;<i>Also, what has changed so far in terms of the OO part of
</I>&gt;<i>Tao.ODE 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Nothing yet.  The initial focus is on getting the basic bindings done. 
There were a number of classes in the code Randy sent me that provide an
OO layer on top of the basic bindings, but they don't get worked on
until later.  Once the basic bindings are done, I was going to throw the
OO bits out there for people to work on - it didn't make much sense to
do this before the bindings were available.

&gt;<i>and are structs now used instead of IntPtr's?  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Probably in places, but I can answer that better once I get further into
the codebase.  What's wrong with IntPtr?  My reading suggests IntPtr is
preferred when you can get away with it. 

&gt;<i>Also will the
</I>&gt;<i>real using alias be replaced with the float keyword?  It seems much
</I>&gt;<i>less ugly that way IMHO and you can always search-replace for float if
</I>&gt;<i>need-be and that would be easier then changing the using alias for
</I>&gt;<i>each source file.  
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>No.  In fact the alias is 'dReal', and there are more aliases now to
more closely match the ODE data types (see
<A HREF="http://ode.org/ode-latest-userguide.html#sec_4_2_0">http://ode.org/ode-latest-userguide.html#sec_4_2_0</A>).  Ugly it may be
from a C# purist's perspective, but it's much easier to follow the ODE
documentation and read/port code this way.  It doesn't bother me so much
in the direct bindings since they are trying to adhere as closely as
possible to the published API.  The OO wrappers would be the place to
clean this up if it bothers people too much.  And once this is out of my
hands folks can do what they want.  The aliases definitely make things
easier right now.

&gt;<i>Also, will anyone be adding the documentation/comments to ODE as XML comments?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes - I'm doing that as I work.

&gt;<i>RealmForge needs at least two physics developers.  I am coping that
</I>&gt;<i>c0d3g33k will be one once he finishes his Tao.ODE work, however is
</I>&gt;<i>there anyone else with experience with C# and ODE and consistent time
</I>&gt;<i>to spare who would like to take this on this role as well?
</I>&gt;<i>--
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>More on this later - I just used up most of my ODE work time today on
this long reply to lots of questions. :-)
