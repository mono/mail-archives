<PRE>I've tried to start the examples either in cygwin or by dbl-clicking on the 
executable.. Yes I've start commandline-non cygwin. No matter how I run it, 
if there's an error it defaults to cordbg, which prints out information. So 
for Glwf.Gears example, I through in glfw.dll, tao.glfw.dll , and 
cygwin1.dll because itw as complaining that I needed it. Now now errors 
occur, and the executable loads, but nothing appears on screen. 

Then I started to throw in all the dll files from the tao\dist\bin 
direcotry. No use.

So now i've thrown out cygwin1.dll, windows complains twice, and then cordbg 
popus up telling me that it was unable to load dll &quot;glfw.dll&quot;, which i've 
copied straight from the glfw directory.

AT this point if I use Nehe's examples, they ask me if I want to full 
screen. No matter what I choose a window pops up, but nothing is displayed 
and there is no debug output.

Last of all, I've piped my buildstrong.bat information to a log file and I 
searched it for Errors and didn't find any, lathough my friend is getting 
the Security errors from earlier.

</I>How do you start the examples? Ever tried to start them from a command line? 
It should tell what the exception is exactly about.
What dll's axactly do you have copied over to the examples folder? Only the 
glfw.dll or also all of the dll files from tao\dist\bin?
