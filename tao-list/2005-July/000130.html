<PRE>Howdy folks.

As you may have read in a previous message, I bought a house.  Got a 
little tired of the city so I am moving to a more rural area outside of 
town.  The house is really nice and I've been looking for a while, so I 
didn't want to pass it up.   Of course the downside is that it's 
apparently so rural I can't get cable or dsl.  That basically leaves me 
with either dialup (I haven't had less than 5Mb/s since like '96, ugh) 
or satellite (I've heard the horror stories).  I'll probably end up with 
satellite if that's my only choice, but for some period of time after I 
move (on the 15th) I'll likely be without an internet connection 
(egads!).  Anywho, my domains will probably 404 and mail to me will 
bounce until I get something squared away.  On that note if anyone knows 
of any cheap place that I can park my domains, host mail, and preferably 
Community Server cheaply, let me know.  Also if anyone out there has any 
clout at Time Warner to get them to run me some cable let me know 
(apparently they don't want to run cable 3 miles for lil' ole me).  I'm 
sure Tao will be in good hands with Vlad and Dave.  Hopefully, with any 
luck I won't be gone too terribly long.  In the meantime I'll have some 
time to dedicate to actually writing a game.  :)

TTFN

</PRE>
