<PRE>Nope, it's on, been trying to hit a deadline at work :)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi folks.  I had some misc. issues I wanted to bring up.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1.  I don't have access to the Mono wiki, since account creation is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; disabled.  Could someone add Tao.Ode to the list of supported bindings
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and list me as maintainer?  (While you're at it, maybe add PhysFS and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Rob Loach as maintainer too).  Alternatively, what's the procedure for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; getting an account so I can do this myself?
</I>
As far as I can tell, the procedure is to ask miguel.. I'll add
Tao.Ode and PhysFS.  I'll talk to him about getting you added as well.

&gt;<i> &gt; 2.  I'd like to call for another incremental release (1.2.0-3?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1.2.1?).  I've committed a number of bug fixes and improvements to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Tao.Ode since the last release and I'd like to have updated binaries
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; available for download.  Also, Tao.PhysFS has been added to SVN since
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the last release and could probably benefit from wider exposure.
</I>
I agree; let's plan on 1.2.1, say, next weekend?  It sounds like
things are in a stable state in SVN.

&gt;<i> &gt; 3.  Linux download:  Can we please include strong-named assemblies in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; addition to/instead of unsigned assemblies?  This allows addition of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Tao assemblies to the GAC when building a package for linux
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; distributions.  Also:  Include source for bindings and examples in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; linux download.
</I>
I'm still not a big fan of putting Tao in the GAC, but it sounds like
I've been outvoted on this :)  As for the source for bindings/examples
-- why not just download a separate source tarball/zip file?  I'd even
be tempted to split it up into just the dlls as a &quot;runtime&quot; package,
and then examples with source and binaries as a separate package, and
then a full source package.

&gt;<i> &gt; 4.  &quot;Building Tao&quot; instructions on homepage:  Should be amended to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mention the build.bat and buildstrong.bat files which don't require
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cygwin to build on Windows.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 5.  Can we capture and document the exact nature of the difference
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; between the .NET and Mono downloads (which bindings aren't portable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and why)?  I remember the discussion from last summer, but I don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recall the details or what might have changed since then.  I'm also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; under the impression that a number of the bindings *are* portable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; regardless of build platform and the differences apply only to certain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ones (Tao.OpenGL, Tao.SDL?).  This information would be useful to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; those building Tao from source who are working with or targeting both
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; platforms.
</I>
Yep, good idea; this should probably be on the wiki page as well.  I
think that it's Tao.Ode, Tao.OpenGL, and the GLUT bindings that aren't
portable.  One of the things that I'd like is a test suite for each of
the modules, so we can catch some of these portability/etc. errors. 
Hopefully a lot of this can go away with .NET 2.0 as well.
