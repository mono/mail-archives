<PRE>Hi folks.  I had some misc. issues I wanted to bring up.

1.  I don't have access to the Mono wiki, since account creation is 
disabled.  Could someone add Tao.Ode to the list of supported bindings 
and list me as maintainer?  (While you're at it, maybe add PhysFS and 
Rob Loach as maintainer too).  Alternatively, what's the procedure for 
getting an account so I can do this myself?

2.  I'd like to call for another incremental release (1.2.0-3?  
1.2.1?).  I've committed a number of bug fixes and improvements to 
Tao.Ode since the last release and I'd like to have updated binaries 
available for download.  Also, Tao.PhysFS has been added to SVN since 
the last release and could probably benefit from wider exposure.

3.  Linux download:  Can we please include strong-named assemblies in 
addition to/instead of unsigned assemblies?  This allows addition of Tao 
assemblies to the GAC when building a package for linux distributions.  
Also:  Include source for bindings and examples in the linux download.

4.  &quot;Building Tao&quot; instructions on homepage:  Should be amended to 
mention the build.bat and buildstrong.bat files which don't require 
Cygwin to build on Windows.

5.  Can we capture and document the exact nature of the difference 
between the .NET and Mono downloads (which bindings aren't portable and 
why)?  I remember the discussion from last summer, but I don't recall 
the details or what might have changed since then.  I'm also under the 
impression that a number of the bindings *are* portable regardless of 
build platform and the differences apply only to certain ones 
(Tao.OpenGL, Tao.SDL?).  This information would be useful to those 
building Tao from source who are working with or targeting both platforms.

In the case of Tao.Ode:  Tao.Ode.dll built on Linux not portable to 
Windows since IL modification to fix callbacks isn't applied.  
Conversely, the assembly built on Windows (with IL hacks applied) should 
run fine on both Windows and Linux, in theory.



Thanks,

Terry
