</I>Cool - thanks.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>2.  I'd like to call for another incremental release (1.2.0-3?

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I agree; let's plan on 1.2.1, say, next weekend?  It sounds like

</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Excellent.  Things do seem to be relatively stable at the moment (except 
for me, I think).  Break out the bubbly!

&gt;<i>I'm still not a big fan of putting Tao in the GAC, but it sounds like
</I>&gt;<i>I've been outvoted on this :)  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I can think of good arguments for both GAC/not-GAC.  In my case, I am 
specifically thinking in the context of the managed-dependency 
environment you find for well-maintained Linux distributions.  One of 
the first issues I had to work out when I discovered Tao was to get the 
right native libs on my system, particularly the 'non-mainstream' ones.  
I want Tao packages for distributions to require the right native libs 
(and versions, if necessary) so they are always there on the system.  
Once this dependency relationship exists, it makes sense to elevate the 
Tao binding in question to the level of 'system library' (ie. put it in 
the GAC), since the native libraries Tao depends on exist at that level 
as well. 

Note this applies more to the notion of setting up a development 
environment that includes Tao, rather than a runtime environment for 
Tao-using applications.  It makes just as much sense to deliver Tao dlls 
and native depencencies along with the application in the latter case (a 
game, say).  I don't know, maybe a game or app developer would 
appreciate having the infrastructure already in place.

&gt;<i>As for the source for bindings/examples
</I>&gt;<i>-- why not just download a separate source tarball/zip file?  I'd even
</I>&gt;<i>be tempted to split it up into just the dlls as a &quot;runtime&quot; package,
</I>&gt;<i>and then examples with source and binaries as a separate package, and
</I>&gt;<i>then a full source package.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Sounds good.  Is a little more work to set up releases, but covers most 
of the downstream use-cases I can think of.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>5.  Can we capture and document the exact nature of the difference
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>between the .NET and Mono downloads (which bindings aren't portable
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>and why)?  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Yep, good idea; this should probably be on the wiki page as well.  I
</I>&gt;<i>think that it's Tao.Ode, Tao.OpenGL, and the GLUT bindings that aren't
</I>&gt;<i>portable.  One of the things that I'd like is a test suite for each of
</I>&gt;<i>the modules, so we can catch some of these portability/etc. errors. 
</I>&gt;<i>Hopefully a lot of this can go away with .NET 2.0 as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Tao.SDL too, I think, since it also uses the IL hack for callback delegates.
Test suite is a good idea, though it's not always clear how to implement 
such a beast for some of the bindings.  In the case of the callbacks, 
you don't know anything is wrong until you get a (rather cryptic) 
exception or segfault. 
.NET 2.0 certainly does help a lot.  I tried with Tao.Ode, and the 
callback stuff works well without all the IL-hackery - very simple. 
I suggest that after this next release we revisit the .NET 2.0 issue and 
maybe target .NET 2.0 support for the next release.  Can't avoid the 
issue forever.

Thanks,

T.
