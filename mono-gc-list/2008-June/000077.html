<PRE>I think my optimism may have got the better of me. The CLR has a mechanism to
handle internal references, but I don't believe this answers your question or
solves your issue. The CLI GC handles interior references to objects even in C#
for &quot;byref&quot; paramaters, but only for interior references on the stack. Here are
some potentially useful references:

(see the bottom of this for comments on Rotor)

Partition I, section 12.4.1.5.2, it talks about byref and lifetimes.
Partition II, section 12, it talks about interfaces and mentions MI.

----

However, it occurs to me that in C++ MI you may need interior pointers that are
not on the stack. Your concern may be well-founded, as the snippets I can find
only talk about Rotor tracing interior references which are on the stack.

Perhaps someone with more knowledge can offer a more complete (or accurate)
answer.
