This is precisely the problem. The GC deals with managed resources only and
the MemoryPressure API completely unties one from the other.
So, when should a collection based on the current managed and unmanaged
pressure? Will a minor collection be enough to alleviate the current
native one? Or should it perform a major GC?

The only answer you can drawn from those design questions is that
AddMemoryPressure can increase collection frequency significantly, which
does reduce throughput.

Explicitly disposing is doable in almost all scenarios given one thinks
enough on the problem. I've seen this same story many times in all sorts
of managed langages and having user code do its job always results in a
better solution.

Also, from a functional perspective of composability, it's not just a mild
&gt;<i> convenience, as garbage collection is what allows the immutability of

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm lost here. A garbage collector has nothing do to with
object immutability. User code that doesn't change such objects is.

In a modular pipeline, there's no one who knows when it's safe to dispose
&gt;<i> an image, as it depends for how long this image will be thrown around,
</I>&gt;<i> which in turn depends on the specific pipeline you're running it through.
</I>&gt;<i> It's the same with LINQ queries, when you handle transient intermediate
</I>&gt;<i> projections during complex queries, you don't really want to handle
</I>&gt;<i> responsibility to anyone in particular as to how that projection will end
</I>&gt;<i> up being used, as this will screw modularity and composability.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This grows from the wrong assumption that native resource management is or
should be transparent. If you extend resource management to be
part of the contract you expose, it will compose as well as everything
else. This works just fine with iterators, for example.
