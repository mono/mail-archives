<PRE>Hi again,

Actually, I was searching more about it and I really cannot find by
googling or elsewhere (i.e. scrounging MSDN documentations) and I couldn't
find an example of what would be a &quot;proper&quot; use of memory pressure apart
from the one I described. The MSDN docs even mention &quot; In the simplest
usage pattern, a managed object allocates unmanaged memory in the
constructor and releases it in the Dispose or Finalize method.&quot;

Could you maybe give me a practical example of what you would find a good
and valid use of memory pressure so I can have a better idea of what you
have in mind?

Thanks again,
G

P.S.: I just realized that by accident I was replying directly to a
personal e-mail account rather than to the mailing list, so please consider
the attached mailing history as well.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> First for all, thanks for your input, I always love to discuss these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> things.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I agree with most of your points but there are added difficulties which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make the problem harder. First of all, just to make it clear that my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specific problem concerns the design of a general-purpose and modular
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> asynchronous data processing framework, so I can't benefit from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> application-specific or even composition-specific solutions that would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> address this problem. Second of all, the asynchronous nature of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> framework makes it much harder to design a contract that would work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seamlessly across all data types of the framework without making everything
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> too cumbersome for the user. Simplicity and rapid prototyping are one of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> its main goals and tenets, and that's every bit as important for my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scenario as performance.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sorry for not being clear about immutability, and I grant you your point
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about that property having nothing to do with a GC. However, there is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> indeed a reason why functional languages do require a GC for being of any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use. I just have not seen any single example of a functional programming
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> language that does not heavily use collection, even when operating very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> close to C++ like D. The reason is that if you want to allow for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> composition in the functionally elegant style you simply must let go of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handling the transients. I would say that's one of the main points for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> these languages actually.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That said, I am in fact concerned with performance, but my statements
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> before were in the direction of claiming that the pressured GC can indeed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be performant under most of the scenarios in which the framework is and has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been used. Again, we're talking about transient intermediate objects,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> meaning objects that will most likely not survive a gen 0 collection. This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> effectively means the pressured GC's decision to collect is more likely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than not always correct and will target the right objects, by virtue of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they being short-lived.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, the argument for whether native resource management should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transparent or not, in my scenario the arguments for this are exactly the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> same as for why it's useful to have a GC in the first place. It is possible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to compose applications in C/C++ and other languages where you have to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> explicitly handle all the memory, but again, there is a reason why people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tried to move beyond this, even under exactly performance-related
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> criticism.  My resources are not TCP connections, file handles or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> structures with other complex side-effects. Conceptually, they are every
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bit as valid for a GC as a native object, with the exception they do not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> live in the managed heap. Granted, this fact alone bears a whole host of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> potential implications, but following the tenet of &quot;premature optimization
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is the root of all evil&quot; I have yet to see any performance related issues
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> related specifically to this point after 5-years of heavily using this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> approach in .NET windows machines for everything from multi-sensory
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> acquisition, computer graphics and computation-intensive processing. Agree
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that that doesn't mean the problem is not there, just that it never showed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up in the many difficult use cases we put it through.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Finally, I have in fact considered many times in the past moving away
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from the current functional-oriented paradigm to a more explicit memory
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> model where the user has to provide specific nodes for processing the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> images. However, this would make image processing such a deviant special
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> case in the framework, and would make everything so much harder for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> user, that I just couldn't bring myself to do it until I really see a need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for it. But I'm still very much thinking of how it could be done and I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sure it definitely can be done, just not in a form that I'm currently happy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with. The one thing I'm fairly confident is that whatever the solution is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it should not transpire back to the composer layer. At most, it will imply
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a custom memory pool for image allocation and deallocation which will have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> its own GC-like strategy...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All the best and thanks again for all the feedback, really appreciate it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> :-)

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I understand completely why people would think that, I honestly do, but
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I confess I'm at a loss why it should be a problem at a conceptual level,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> or why it MemoryPressure shouldn't be used this way.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  We're talking about highly transient native resources (e.g. images),
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> which are completely tied to a managed representation which I'm using to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> compose modular high-throughput data processing pipelines. In the end it's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> not as different from just allocating an array of bytes.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This is precisely the problem. The GC deals with managed resources only
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and the MemoryPressure API completely unties one from the other.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So, when should a collection based on the current managed and unmanaged
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> pressure? Will a minor collection be enough to alleviate the current
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> native one? Or should it perform a major GC?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The only answer you can drawn from those design questions is that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> AddMemoryPressure can increase collection frequency significantly, which
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> does reduce throughput.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Explicitly disposing is doable in almost all scenarios given one thinks
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> enough on the problem. I've seen this same story many times in all sorts
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of managed langages and having user code do its job always results in a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> better solution.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Also, from a functional perspective of composability, it's not just a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> mild convenience, as garbage collection is what allows the immutability of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> objects to be preserved across calls.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm lost here. A garbage collector has nothing do to with
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> object immutability. User code that doesn't change such objects is.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In a modular pipeline, there's no one who knows when it's safe to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> dispose an image, as it depends for how long this image will be thrown
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> around, which in turn depends on the specific pipeline you're running it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> through. It's the same with LINQ queries, when you handle transient
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> intermediate projections during complex queries, you don't really want to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> handle responsibility to anyone in particular as to how that projection
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> will end up being used, as this will screw modularity and composability.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This grows from the wrong assumption that native resource management is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> or should be transparent. If you extend resource management to be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> part of the contract you expose, it will compose as well as everything
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> else. This works just fine with iterators, for example.
