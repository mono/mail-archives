<PRE>Hey guys!

I have a question for you again. What do you think is better a Fast
allocation process or a lightweight collection?. The algorithms that
provides a fast allocator should have a collector heavier than the
algorithms that provides a slow allocator. For example Mark-Sweep and
Mark-Compact. Mark-Sweep have a &quot;slow&quot; allocator and a fast collection
routine. Mark-Compact have a fast allocator and a slow collection
routine.

I think that in a application with an adjusted size of the heap, the
fact of having a fast allocator make the application faster than the
fact of having a fast collector. Because generally the number of
allocations is greater than the number of collections (note that we have
a good adjusted heap). But if a collection is needed, the time that it
going to consume will be bigger than the time necessary in a fast
collector with slow allocator.

What do you think that is better for Mono? A fast allocator and slow
collector or a slow allocator and fast collector?

I know that there are other parameters to consider, but I would like to
know your opinions in the common case.

Thanks.

Regards.
