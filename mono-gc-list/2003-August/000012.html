Are you writing us a new gc?

Previously we've studied the ORP garbage collection libraries.  We were
going to incorporate that code into mono, but it being c++ made that too
difficult without lots of rewriting.  The ORP hackers were going to
reimplement in C, but we haven't heard from them since then, and we used
the Boehm libgc as an interim measure.

The ORP collector had several algorithms, but the most interesting one
from our point of view was the incremental copying one.  As far as I
know, the gc in the ms runtime uses this technique too.
