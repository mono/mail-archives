I think you meant to say it _can't_ take advantage. 
That's right, the C stack is still scanned conservatively.

&gt;<i> My initial question refers to a simply &quot;stop-the-world&quot; collector. In

</I>
I would go for a copying collector to start with, just because it is a
bit simpler.

&gt;<i> In theory, a copying one needs more space (the double than Mark-Compact)
</I>&gt;<i> and less time (only needs to travel through the heap once, instead of
</I>&gt;<i> Mark-Compact that needs to travel through at least twice) than a

</I>
Huh?  Did you mean to say that the complexity of Mark-Sweep will be
similar to the complexity of Mark-Compact?

&gt;<i> Personally, i think that a Mark-Compact will be better because we can

</I>
It will only be &quot;more compatible&quot; in the sense that the performance
characteristics might be a bit more similar.  I think that is a very
low-priority goal.
