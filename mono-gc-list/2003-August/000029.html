I think it is much more important to have a lightweight collector with
controllable worst-case pause times.

&gt;<i> I think that in a application with an adjusted size of the heap, the

In appliactions where pauses are unacceptable, there is no way to
&quot;work around&quot; the problem.

Constant factor performance degredation is not relevant. Computers get
faster every year, it is easy to use more computers, and in the rare
windows of time where this is a problem for a specific application,
they are probably writing in C instead of C# anyhow.

In other words, I'm saying that if:

 X = # of programs which won't tolorate GC pauses
 Y = # of programs which won't tolorate 20% degredation (C-&gt;C#)
 Z = # of programs which won't tolorate 10% allocation overhead

Then:

 Z ~= 0  : most of these programs are in Y, not Z.
 X &gt;&gt; Z  : the number of programs which can be written in
           Mono with a low-pause collector will be greater than
           with a high-pause, low-overhead collector
