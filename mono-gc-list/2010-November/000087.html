<PRE>This is my first message on the mono-gc mailing list and I hope I will not
break any implicit rule it may have. Otherwise please let me know!

I decided to use my CS thesis as an opportunity to contribute some code to
the mono project. Lupus kindly offered the following task:

&quot;we currently have 2 generations: introduce a third one that sits between
the nursery and the old generation. It should be a bump-pointer
style generation for fast gen0 collections.&quot;

Before starting to dig into the code, I need to justify the change that is
proposed. I suppose the purpose of a new generation is to create a  group of
objects from
a different age in order to recollect as much of them as possible
before sending them to the two oldest generations. Is that correct?

Please correct me but I'm guessing the new flow of collection would be as
follow:

gen0 - newest objects - bump-pointer based
*gen1 - middle aged objects  - bump-pointer based (the new generation)*
gen2 - oldest generation - size-segregated freelists
gen3 - oldest generation - bump-pointer based

Thank you!
