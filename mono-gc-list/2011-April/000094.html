<PRE>Hello list,

I've got a problem regarding the SIGXCPU signal raised obviously by garbage 
collector, which is described here: 
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Embedding_Mono">http://www.mono-project.com/Embedding_Mono</A>

First let me explain what I have did (I have no X11 or X.org installed):

- Compile &amp; install DirectFB (git version)
- Compile and install gtk+ 2.24 against DirectFB
- Compile several libraries needed by mono &amp; gtk-sharp (both latest stable)
- Compile and install webkit
- Compile and install webkit-sharp
- Create a simple C# application which makes use of the webkit-sharp
- Run it using mono

The application exits using SIGXCPU and writes &quot;CPU time limit exceeded.&quot; to 
console. gdb does not really help here. I can provide all traces needed to 
find a solution for that.

I strongly believe, it has something to do with my architecture and has 
nothing to do with mono itself or any of the used components. A test with 
GtkHTML patched into gtk-sharp gives the same result.

Where is the correct place to catch that SIGXCPU and provide the signal back 
to app so my application is able to run?

When the time has come and my application runs well I want to contribute all 
of my patches to the several projects.

Thanks and regards

Maik
