mono-gc-list is for the discussion of the implementation of the garbage
collector in the mono runtime.  Problems building mono should be
addressed to <A HREF="mailto:mono-list@ximian.com.">mono-list@ximian.com.</A>

(I've followed up to the gc list so this goes in the archive.)



Now, to actually answer your questions...

&gt;<i> When I try to run samples compilet during gtk-sharp compilation and
</I>&gt;<i> installation I got error message to:
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="mailto:gekon@gekon">gekon@gekon</A>:/tmp/gtk-sharp-0.8/sample# mono gtk-hello-world.exe
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> Unhandled Exception: System.ExecutionEngineException: No GCHandle=20
</I>&gt;<i> support built-in
</I>
gtk# relies on GC support in the runtime.


&gt;<i> Shortly after command make I got some strange error message:
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> [...cut....]
</I>&gt;<i> In file included from ../../mono/io-layer/handles-private.h:16,
</I>&gt;<i>                   from daemon.c:26:
</I>&gt;<i> ../../mono/io-layer/wapi-private.h:25:2: #error configure failed to=20
</I>&gt;<i> discover size of unix socket path
</I>&gt;<i> make[3]: *** [daemon.lo] Error 1
</I>
There was a problem with your build - configure failed to discover the
size of the unix socket path field.  I don't know how to make this
clearer.

&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> But there is no useful suggestion for me.
</I>&gt;<i> I tried to find some information in config.log but I
</I>&gt;<i> could not figure out what is important in this file for the problem.
</I>
Search for &quot;sun_path&quot; in config.log, and see if there are errors logged
in the next few lines of output.

&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> I downloaded every source yesterday, so I use latest versions.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm Slackware 9.0 user with kernel 2.4.20 and every
</I>&gt;<i> package comming with Slack 9.0 - nothing changed.
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> Please, could someone help me ?
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to manage to run gtk-sharp applications.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm going to create some software, and port from Windows, but it
</I>&gt;<i> is new problem for me and I'm not so experienced to solve it.
</I>
If you can't build it successfully, then I can only suggest precompiled
versions (you can unpack the rpms with rpm2cpio to get the contents.)

There's a script available from <A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/download.html">http://www.go-mono.com/download.html</A>
which should automate the mono build, but it won't solve the configure
problem.
