<PRE>Hi -

I'm trying to hunt down a threading bug in wine that shows up when some of
the unit tests from mono are run under wine (so using a windows version of
mono). The bug shows up during the GC collect cycle (the function is gc_push
or something like that). It's not a bug in mono per se, but being able to
trace the operation of the gc would make figuring out what's going on much
easier. Is there any good tracing facility for this? I've tried &quot;mono
--trace=System.GC&quot;, but I don't get anything out.

Also, is there any way to control the operation of the GC (such as forcing a
full pass at a pre-determined time etc.). Part of the problem with the bug
I'm trying to hunt down is that it occurs very rarely (unsurprising as its
likely to do with wine's handling of threading), so coming up with a better
way than running the tests until the bug occurs would be awesome.

Thanks,
Matt Jones
