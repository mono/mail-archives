I don't really have an opinion on this issue, not knowing what that  
flag changes. Maybe if you tell us you'll get some more replies. :-)


But talking of changes for OS X, I have some suggestions, too:

- add a symlink Mono.framework/Versions/1.2.1/Mono in addition to  
Mono.framework/Mono
(this is what other frameworks are linked to, according to otool -L)

- move glibconfig[.(ppc|x86)].h from Libraries/glib-2.0/include to  
Headers/glib-2.0
(reduces the number of include paths that need to be manually added  
in order to compile)

- consider only having one version &quot;A&quot; (like many Apple frameworks)  
instead of the actual Mono versions (1.2.1 etc.)
(the need to install both in parallel inside the framework should be  
rather rare and this would avoid the need for an install_name_tool  
invocation for each native executable and library linked to Mono;  
otherwise it doesn't work as soon as the installed Mono version differs)
