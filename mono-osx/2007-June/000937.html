I think filing a bug report sooner (like within the next week) rather than
later should be the first order of business, assuming a bug hasn't already
been filed, of course. This is definitely a bug we need fixed in Mac OS X
10.5 Leopard, and my main concern is that it may be getting too close to the
deadline for getting changes integrated into Leopard. (I wouldn't be
surprised if a &quot;beta&quot; is released at WWDC in a few days.) We need to make
sure the Mac OS X kernel or BSD engineers are aware of the problem and its
seriousness, basically how this affects Mac OS X usage and development in
typical Active Directory environments. You can always track down where the 16
bits are getting lost and submit a patch later. I do recommend that you
submit your small C program which demonstrates the problem with your bug
report. Failing test cases are sometimes more useful than patches for
development teams.

Of course, it's entirely possible it may already be fixed in Leopard.
Unfortunately, anyone who has access to Leopard builds and who might be able
to test it probably can't comment publicly on whether or not it is still
broken in Leopard.

It might be worth bringing up the topic on the darwin-dev mailing list, in
addition to filing a bug report.

Just my thoughts on the matter.... Thanks for your research into the matter
and sticking with it!

Hope this helps,
Ed
