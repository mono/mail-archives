<PRE>Hi,

Is there any reason the Mono.framework installer package creates symlinks in /usr/bin instead of /usr/local/bin?

It was a while back now but it was actually an older version of Mono.framework that decided to overwrite the system version of /usr/bin/sqlite3 with a symlink to the one in the framework. I didn't discover this until later, when I'd already upgraded to a newer version of Mono that didn't event have the sqlite3 executable in it. Since then I've been weary of anything that puts things in /usr/bin and not /usr/share/bin.

Other *nix packages that I've installed are living happily (or are symlinked in) /usr/local so I'm not sure what is meant by &quot;Yes, we know that this is not typical for *NIX, but this is Mac OS X. &quot;. You also wouldn't need to suggest, &quot;If you'd like to access the mono manpages you'll have to add Library/Framework/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/man to your manpath&quot;, just put symlinks in /usr/local/share/man.

Regards,

James
