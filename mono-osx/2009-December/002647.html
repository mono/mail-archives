Yes, and I find this exceedingly annoying. :-(

I have occasionally (or maybe it was only once before the recession hit me?)
sent money to one of the projects. I am totally willing to help as much as I
can.

But I found that many new users/developers looking for a native GUI for .NET
programs on Mac OS X still head towards Cocoa# and find it unusable and then
give up.

I point them to Delphi Prism and Monobjc whenever I can but the (now) large
number of projects doesn't help. (You need a name for your project!)

Please, Mono team, Miguel etc, set up a conference call or something with
all those excellent developers and see if this can be organised a bit.

IDEALLY we would need one project consisting of DLLs that allow native use
of Cocoa classes and methods as well as a Windows.Forms compatibility
wrapper. And the recommended way for .NET applications on Mac OS X would
then be to use Windows.Forms and the wrapper and direct Cocoa classes only
for some effects.

It seems like we are close to supporting all of Cocoa but far from having
this organised smoothly.

I will donate EUR 250 to whichever project or project consolidation such a
conference call would then recommend. I hope that others will also invest
money or effort. (I know it's not much but I am cheap but I would plan to
keep donating.)
