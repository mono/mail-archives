<PRE>After extensive research in how best to bring our C# application from
Windows to Mac we deemed the only viable solution was to write the UI in
native Cocoa.  The UI embeds Mono and using mobjc/mcocoa the C# classes
expose the core business logic.  Yes some code is written twice.  This
overhead is well worth the cost of having a native looking UI on Windows and
on Mac.

Many similarities exist in a UI but it is the details that make an app feel
natural.  Given that most Mac users are fanatics, especially in our user
base, having a sub-standard UI was not an option.

The theory of reusing a Windows Form application out of the box sounds
good... however in practice the end result will not behave like a 100%
native Mac application.  That is not an acceptable option in my mind.

It is the same concept for MonoTouch.  They did not reinvent how iPhone apps
are rendered.  They are using the native tools which provides an accurate UI
for the end user.

</I>&gt;<i> but they all are based on simple C functions calls.  Marshaling Mono
</I>&gt;<i> subclasses of the Cocoa framework classes across the divide is a big help.

</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> each platform.  But I believe that the ability to take an executable from
</I>&gt;<i> one platform to another, and get reasonably correct behavior and appearance
</I>&gt;<i> is achievable and will give a huge boost to cross-platform
</I>&gt;<i> interoperability.
</I>&gt;<i> There are other cross-platform GUIs (like GTK#) out there, but I suspect
</I>&gt;<i> that the people using them are outnumbered by .Net developers using SWF.
</I>&gt;<i> SWF is key to making the Mac accessible to the .Net talent pool.  The
</I>&gt;<i> Carbon
</I>&gt;<i> Driver is riddled with calls to functions that have been deprecated or are
</I>&gt;<i> not available to 64-bit applications.  Apple introduced Carbon to ease the
</I>&gt;<i> transition from OS 9 to OS X and seems more inclined to retire it than to
</I>&gt;<i> maintain it.
