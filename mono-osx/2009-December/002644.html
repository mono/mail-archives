I am not so good with the advanced anything, but I can send some money if
you tell me where.

I can also test.

I am familiar enough with .NET but only on the write-applications level, not
the extend-framework level.

</I>&gt;<i> recently stopped using an outlaw feature, inheritance in value types). 
</I>&gt;<i> Using any bridge package raises issues.  The structure of the makefiles
</I>&gt;<i> under the mcs directory makes excluding the dependency from builds on
</I>&gt;<i> other systems difficult.  The powers that be in the Mono community have
</I>&gt;<i> expressed reservations about making Mono dependent on such a package until
</I>&gt;<i> it gathers such a following as to be bundled with Mono like Cocoa#.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Delphi Prism comes with Monobjc. Perhaps Novell should include all three
Cocoa bridges in Mono or set up a meeting with all the people involved so
that everyone can come up with a decision.

I don't think it's good that we have three (technically two) bridges to
choose from.




&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Most examples of Cocoa event handling involve subclassing Cocoa classes
</I>&gt;<i> and overriding a different method for each event type.  For that reason
</I>&gt;<i> and because event handling in Mono's System.Windows.Forms does not fit
</I>&gt;<i> with using the Cocoa run loop, I try to take events directly from the
</I>&gt;<i> event queue.  But some &quot;events&quot; are not presented as NSEvent objects in
</I>&gt;<i> the event queue.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Over my head... I know about the .NET event model and a bit about the way
Cocoa handles this, but don't understand at all how these two could possibly
be made to work together. Good luck!




&gt;<i> I could really use a cookbook of Carbon to Cocoa translations, some notes
</I>&gt;<i> on the thinking that went in to some design decisions in
</I>&gt;<i> System.Windows.Forms (particularly the XplatUI subsystem--especially
</I>&gt;<i> XplatUICarbon), and someone I could talk things over with.  It would also
</I>&gt;<i> be helpful for someone in the know to add summary comments to all the
</I>&gt;<i> abstract or virtual properties and methods in XplatUIDriver detailing what
</I>&gt;<i> is expected of their implementations.  It is sometimes difficult to tell
</I>&gt;<i> from looking at the other implementations that may not have a simple
</I>&gt;<i> translation to Cocoa, how closely I need to mimic code that may be
</I>&gt;<i> essential, an implementer's style, unimplemented, or just wrong.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Aren't the people of the Qt framework dealing with a similar problem at the
moment? I think they are still porting Qt to Cocoa after having finished a
Carbon port and then finding out that Carbon doesn't support 64 bit code.

Anyway, I'll happily test and support in any way I can!
