&gt;<i> Miguel, I'd like to suggest that rather than having a single file such
</I>&gt;<i> as appkit.cs each individual obj-c interface be placed in its own
</I>&gt;<i> file.  This makes merging, diffing, etc a bit easier.
</I>
I do not like that approach, it is too much clutter.

Maybe I'll reconsider that in the future, but not now.

There is a minor benefit in diffing and merging, but is so minor, that I
rather keep the current setup just because I do not like the idea of
hundreds of little 1k files that would mostly feel like noise.

&gt;<i> The bindings very closely match the hand bindings from appkit.cs.  The
</I>&gt;<i> main difference is not all of the generated methods have not been
</I>&gt;<i> changed to the C# naming convention.  But the generated methods are
</I>&gt;<i> more complete as they provide access to almost all obj-c selectors.
</I>&gt;<i> And in at least one case are more accurate (setName is incorrectly
</I>&gt;<i> hand bound on NSImage).
</I>
Although I appreciate the work that you are doing with automatically
generating the output, they are completely useless to me if it means
that I have to do the naming.

I still have to audit the contributions, but I would rather audit the
contribution that fix *and* audit the contribution.

That being said, thanks for sharing this with us.   I am sure that I
will turn to your generated stubs (and others will as well) to start
adapting the result into something we can check into the repository. 

&gt;<i> The remaining issues are deciding how to support obj-c types such
</I>&gt;<i> NSRangePointer, NSRectPointer, NSRectEdge, etc.  I have not commented
</I>&gt;<i> these out so the generated bindings do not currently compile.  
</I>
They will need engine support;   It will have to wait for Geoff and
myself to have time on a weekend to look into this.

&gt;<i> However, using the generated files as a basis is still useful if you
</I>&gt;<i> intend to hand bind as you will be 90% complete.
</I>
I agree that the generated files are a good starting point, someone can
start taking each individual file and merging them into our main file.

&gt;<i> I'm adding to the generator as time permits, which has not been a lot
</I>&gt;<i> recently.
</I>
Could you share your updated parser?

miguel
