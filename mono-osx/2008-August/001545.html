<PRE>Miguel,

&gt;<i>    It seems like you have an older version of Cocoa# than Oxygene
</I>&gt;<i> expects.
</I>
that was my initial reaction as well when seeing the Menu .ctor error,  
coz iirc that was long fixed. But Joanna sais she's using the latest?  
1.9.1_3 certainly is the last one i ever used (and i'm ashamed and  
sorry for being so out of the loop, yes &lt;g&gt;), so Oxygene can;t be  
expecting anything newer

fwiw, Oxygene doesn't add any library or layers on top of Cocoa# &quot;all&quot;  
it does is use the existing Cocoa# library, and provide nice  
integration to have code generated from .NIBs and to MacPack apps  
right form inside VS as part of the build process. there can't really  
be any &quot;mismatch&quot; between Cocoa@ and what Oxygene expects (unless you  
go back to really old Cocoa# versions that expect vastly different  
codegen).

so the Menu .ctor exception *does* sound like it needs to be something  
broken in the Cocoa# library itself.

any thoughts, based on this new info?

thanx,
marc

ps: will i see you at PDC?
</PRE>
