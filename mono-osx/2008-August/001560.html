Sure, but that doesn't mean that any given company should.  I'm sure  
they know what they're getting into, and have the expertise to support  
themselves directly.

The OP though, didn't seem like he was in that position at all at  
all.  Encouraging people who are unsure of what they're doing to jump  
into something they're not ready for doesn't help the platform or the  
community.

I didn't want to chime in, mostly because I don't think this is the  
right place for that sort of discussion, but I wanted the OP to get  
some realistic input as well.
