<PRE>Hello all,

I've been posting on the Banshee mailing list but realized that this
is probably a better place to solicit advice.

I've been working on getting Banshee up and running on OSX for the
last few weeks. It's been my primary audio player on Leopard for about
a month. The first few posts regarding this are here:

  <A HREF="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/banshee-list/2008-June/msg00161.html">http://mail.gnome.org/archives/banshee-list/2008-June/msg00161.html</A>
  <A HREF="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/banshee-list/2008-July/msg00147.html">http://mail.gnome.org/archives/banshee-list/2008-July/msg00147.html</A>
  <A HREF="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/banshee-list/2008-August/msg00049.html">http://mail.gnome.org/archives/banshee-list/2008-August/msg00049.html</A>

I've been updating a branch here:

  <A HREF="http://github.com/eoin/banshee-osx">http://github.com/eoin/banshee-osx</A>

I'm at the point where I'd like to create an application bundle. My
research has taken me to MonoDevelop. My understanding is that it's
installed into the Mono installation prefix, linked into /usr/bin and
then started by a script in the bundle. I'm not sure this is the best
approach for Banshee. I'd prefer a more osx-like self contained
bundle. However, it seems that OSX expects a binary within the bundle
to be directly executable. In my situation I'll need to manipulate the
environment a little and then point mono at the .exe.

Are there any examples of self contained mono OSX bundles? I could
probably create a script in python or ruby that set's up the
environment, locates the binary and runs it but I thought I'd ask if
the problem has been solved already. Or perhaps I should just be
installing into the mono installation prefix.

Any advice is welcome!

Thanks,
Eoin
