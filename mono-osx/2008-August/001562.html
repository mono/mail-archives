<PRE>Sorry for the eventual double post, i used the wrong email for the  
first attempt...

 From my standpoint, as a developer working primarily on the mac with  
Mono, using Windows for the occasional debugging and having shipped an  
open sourced toolkit with roughly 170K lines of code, and 300  
downloads a day on average....

(which of course is still a very different beast than writing a  
commercial application in the vertical space).

-&gt; the mono community has, on average been very helpful. This is a  
good point.  I did not need a lot of help, but when i had a problem,  
questions were normally answered very fast and precise

-&gt; Mono is very stable. I am a decent developer, and most of the time  
i just work in mono, and only use windows to debug hard problems. That  
for me is the way to go and the reason VMWare exists for me :). Yes,  
there is MonoDevelop etc, but for now, nothing beats debugging .NET  
code in VS.NET if you need to debug at all. No complains here.

-&gt; Mono is very compatible to .NET 2.0. I am not using LINQ etc inside  
the mono world

-&gt; Ui is a challenge. Now, i don't write that much UI code (most of  
the code is service layer) so i can not speak for that part too much.  
A mono app, on my default Mac installation, that is a windows form  
app, runs. But heck, it sure does not look good. That's the main  
problem. It also feels a tad slower.

-&gt; UI is a challenge in java as well. While the java app looks nicer  
on the mac than the mono app, writing cross platform UI is always a  
challenge. Java apps on Windows don't feel correct either.

-&gt; UI: So you loose either on the mac or on windows. That's a given,  
in my opinion. In all cases there is a lot you can do about it, but it  
requires extra effort. So what's your MAIN platform?

-&gt; if you go .NET/Mono, you need to be aware that a lot of the very  
new concepts in .NET 3.5, or WPF etc,  are not yet available in Mono  
(at least to my knowledge, please correct me if i am wrong).

I did not catch any data about numbers of installations. I would argue  
that if you have more macs than windows machines, java is probably the  
better choice. If it's the other way round, i would certainly go .NET/ 
Mono. To quote an old favorite of mine: &quot;The needs of the many  
outweigh the needs of the few....&quot;
