If you're going to do so, please ensure you get your facts correct.

Winforms requires X11 to be installed, which is the default since 10.5.
It does not require Gtk at all.

&gt;<i>

I'm not sure what you mean about Gtk#, its now available on the Mac.

</I>
There are several companies using Mono on the mac today.
