<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Please, Mono team, Miguel etc, set up a conference call or something with
</I>&gt;<i> all those excellent developers and see if this can be organised a bit.
</I>
This is a good idea, but nobody has really followed up publicly with any
information that might be useful in making a difference.   

As I said in the past on the mailing list, we want to encourage the use
of an MIT X11, Apache 2 or MS-PL library;   The other issue is that the
bindings that exist today suffer in different forms, for example, many
of them are not .NET-ish enough.

What I would like to see is a MonoTouch-like API system for the Mac.
We would build this, but we just do not have enough time to do it.

&gt;<i> IDEALLY we would need one project consisting of DLLs that allow native use
</I>&gt;<i> of Cocoa classes and methods as well as a Windows.Forms compatibility
</I>&gt;<i> wrapper. And the recommended way for .NET applications on Mac OS X would
</I>&gt;<i> then be to use Windows.Forms and the wrapper and direct Cocoa classes only
</I>&gt;<i> for some effects.
</I>
Well, that sadly wont work.   

The Windows.Forms API and Winforms applications require more control
that can be provided by doing simple wrappers of the API.

Miguel
