<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> I have floated the name &quot;Cocoa Conspiracy&quot; in this forum, but no one was
</I>&gt;<i> interested in conspiring with me.  My project is implementing
</I>&gt;<i> System.Windows.Forms.XplatUICocoa, the Cocoa Driver for Mono's MWF.  This is
</I>&gt;<i> the heart of the implementation of MWF.  It is not a bridge or thin wrapper
</I>&gt;<i> like the products we discussed.  It currently uses MObjc and MCocoa to
</I>&gt;<i> facilitate access to the Cocoa framework.  All the other implementations of
</I>&gt;<i> XplatUIDriver just use PInvokes to access the underlying window system APIs,
</I>&gt;<i> but they all are based on simple C functions calls.  Marshaling Mono
</I>&gt;<i> subclasses of the Cocoa framework classes across the divide is a big help.
</I>
Nice approach.    Is any of this code available for previewing anywhere?

&gt;<i> The project's aim is to help the portability of .Net/Mono applications the
</I>&gt;<i> Mac.  Some insist you cannot get a really good UI without customizing it for
</I>&gt;<i> each platform.  But I believe that the ability to take an executable from
</I>&gt;<i> one platform to another, and get reasonably correct behavior and appearance
</I>&gt;<i> is achievable and will give a huge boost to cross-platform interoperability. 
</I>
I agree;   Additionally, many times, even if you have a native API,
developers go out of their way to differentiate their UIs by creating
custom widgets and custom controls to improve the user experience for a
specific application, so they end up different.

&gt;<i> There are other cross-platform GUIs (like GTK#) out there, but I suspect
</I>&gt;<i> that the people using them are outnumbered by .Net developers using SWF. 
</I>
Correct.

&gt;<i> SWF is key to making the Mac accessible to the .Net talent pool.  The Carbon
</I>&gt;<i> Driver is riddled with calls to functions that have been deprecated or are
</I>&gt;<i> not available to 64-bit applications.  Apple introduced Carbon to ease the
</I>&gt;<i> transition from OS 9 to OS X and seems more inclined to retire it than to
</I>&gt;<i> maintain it.
</I>
Additionally, a collaborator has created a small &quot;bundler&quot; that we are
planning on integrated into Visual Studio, the idea being that you can
go from Visual Studio to a Mac-accessible DMG file that you can
redistribute.
