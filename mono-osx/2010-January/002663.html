Thanks for the tip. I'll review them.

This has been on my list of things to do, but it's been a rather low priority because I have never come across a use case where I thought it would be useful. If you don't mind my asking, where do you think they would be useful?

I think that this would require rewriting mobjc's slow path (which is not a bad idea in any case).

&gt;<i> methods with
</I>&gt;<i> function pointer or block parameters,
</I>
I'll look into doing this for the next version. The only reason I didn't before is that I didn't want to parse function pointer declarations. But I'm now using a generated packrat parser to parse headers so that problem has become a lot more tractable. I've also learned that Apple's frameworks include a file containing metadata for that framework which may prove useful.

&gt;<i> and wrappers for Protocols;
</I>
Right now I'm not planning on doing this anytime soon.

&gt;<i> and some
</I>&gt;<i> form of build switch to target a specific OS X version.  
</I>
Yeah, the current situation is kind of lame. I'll look at doing a better job with this in the next version.

Thanks for the feedback (and apologies for the delay in replying, I've been extremely busy at work trying to get our software out of alpha).
