</I>Looking into your makefile, I found that the dependencies of some targets
(including &quot;all&quot;) are backwards.  Although dependencies and/or rules between
such dependent targets usually force them to be built in the correct
sequence, it may be prudent to list multiple dependencies of a target in the
sequence you would prefer or expect them to be built.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Actually, there may have been some conflict with Mono 2.7, which I
downloaded from the SVN, built, and installed in &quot;/usr/local/&quot;.  Prepending
&quot;/usr/local/bin&quot; to my PATH cleared up that problem.

I also had to delete some hand-written enums and methods from MCocoa 0.7 to
make it compatible with OS X 10.5, which I am running.

On another note, I noticed that there are still no wrappers classes or
interfaces for Objective C Protocols, although their methods are wrapped in
each class that &quot;conforms to&quot; them.  Methods in Category
NSDraggingDestination each have a parameter of type &quot;id &lt;NSDraggingInfo&gt;&quot;. 
Since no class that conforms to that Protocol is exposed in the framework
header files, nothing about it is generated by your generator.  I will
probably need to create my own set of extension methods to handle this.

As for the future development of MObjC/MCocoa, my vote would be for
enhancing the automatic generation to handle variadic methods, methods with
function pointer or block parameters, and wrappers for Protocols; and some
form of build switch to target a specific OS X version.  Work you put into
the generator is work you will not need to put into hand-written code
several times over.
