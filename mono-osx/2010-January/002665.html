I think the issue here is that there is a mismatch between the dynamic world of Objective-C and the much more static world of C#. If you need to call a method which is not exposed via the static C# classes then you need to use NSObject.Call. If you want to override an Objective-C method then you just define a method that starts with a lower case letter:

internal sealed class MySomething : NSSomeThing
{
	public void concludeDragOperation(NSObject sender)
	{
		...
	}
}

Note that you do not override a C# method (tho sometimes the C# base class will have a method with the same name in which case you'll need to use the new keyword). This should work even with protocols because of the way Objective-C does duck typing.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes the application needs to pass an argument that conforms to a
</I>&gt;<i> Protocol to a framework method.  NSPrintPanel's &quot;-
</I>&gt;<i> (void)addAccessoryController: (NSViewController&lt;NSPrintPanelAccessorizing&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> *)accessoryController&quot; is one such method for which there is no example in
</I>&gt;<i> the framework headers of a class conforming to the Protocol. A Mono
</I>&gt;<i> interface for the Protocol may be useful in creating the class that conforms
</I>&gt;<i> to it, although optional methods may complicate creating the class as a
</I>&gt;<i> formal implementation of the interface.
</I>
I'm not sure it would be all that useful except perhaps for IDEs like MSVC that have that slick completion for auto-completing overrides (and I presume implementing interfaces).
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This brings up another point.  MCocoa wraps NSDraggingInfo with a class of
</I>&gt;<i> extension methods.  On the face of it, this is a close analogy of a
</I>&gt;<i> Category.  But the application program that uses these methods needs to
</I>&gt;<i> override them rather than call them.  An extension method wrapper is not
</I>&gt;<i> very useful for this.  
</I>
Right, but it is rather trivial to just write the methods yourself as I did in the example above.
