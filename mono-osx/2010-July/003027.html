You are quite right. I have worked around that issue by using two threads,
each running its own message loop. Its a bit of a mess when you want to
communicate between the two. Fortunately, I only need the trayicon from
GTK#, so there is close to zero communication between the two threads.

I have the setup working fine with GTK# on Windows and GTK# on Linux, which
makes me think that there is an issue with the GTK# StatusIcon on OSX. I'm
not a Mac user, so there may be something I don't get about how Mac's work,
however, I would expect that clicking the icon would issue some sort of
event, and based on the other StatusIcons, I would guess that when pausing
over the icon, it would fire the PopupMenu event.

I can troubleshoot some more, but before I do, I just hoped that someone
could say either &quot;I have events working fine on OSX&quot; or &quot;Its known to not
work on OSX&quot;.

Regards, Kenneth
