<PRE>I'm not sure it is as rare as you think.  While I would agree that it would
be very rare for a home user to use active directory (though I know a couple
who do), among institutional users (schools, colleges, companies,
government, etc), it would be unusual not to use active directory, and I
would be surprised if these users didn't constitute at least 15% of the
install base, and probably more than that.

Do you know if this is only an issue for development or would it be an issue
for deploying Mono applications to machines with AD accounts?  Do you know
where in the Mono runtime this failure is occuring, I wouldn't mind having
one of our engineers poke around if you might have some idea where to start
looking.
