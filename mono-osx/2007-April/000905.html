Gurgle... sending emails too early in the morning. Even if EVFILT_FS
were opened it requires super user priviledges, so it really is a
non-starter in it's current form. Regardless, kevent should work fine
with some tweaking.

The limit can of course be increased as users require to more reasonable
numbers using ulimit, etc. I would suggest something along these lines:

  * If a FSW is asked to monitor for Created and Deleted events, then
    there is no need to monitor individual files within a directory.

  * If a FSW is asked to monitor a specific file or a directory with a
    wildcard then we will need to open each file that matches the filter
    and watch it.

  * If someone is unhappy with the 255 open file descriptor limit, they
    will need to modify their ulimits accordingly. It appears that 10.4
    has a hard limit of 512 by default. This can be modified relatively
    easily to some arbitrarily high value given some OS X config file
    hacking.

I think this would work, am I missing anything?
