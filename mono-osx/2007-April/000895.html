Perhaps.  I worked for Apple in what was the Enterprise and Education
divisions, and I think my numbers are pretty conservative, but maybe the
ratio has shrunk.  I can tell you that one of my current clients is a large
government agency, and macs are not as rare as you might think, and they all
use active directory authentication.

I can't say if its an Apple bug or not.  I could certainly believe that
POSIX threads are done differently in Mac OS X than in Linux, and that the
Apple implementation is incomplete or buggy, I don't have much experience in
that area.  But I do know that in higher level environments, Java, ObjC,
etc, thread and process management work fine on OS X and that many other
development and deployment environments have managed to solve threading
issues without dying early on Mac OS X.  Unless it's solved, it effectively
rules out Mono development for us, but I understand that your mileage may
vary.
