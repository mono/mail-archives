No, like most of the .net framework, i.e.

        &lt;quote&gt;Any public static (Shared in Visual Basic) members of
        this type are thread safe. Any instance members are not
        guaranteed to be thread safe.&lt;/quote&gt;

</I>
Yes, you can (or it's a bug). However you also need to make sure you're
not using the Graphic instance (and other created objects) only from a
single (and original) thread.

</I>&gt;<i> I ask because I've noticed random crashes in a WinForms app on OS X (but

</I>
Please open a bug report on bugzilla.novell.com and attach your test
case.

&gt;<i> On my Linux box it crashes all the time.  I get a wide variety of errors

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've also tried writing some code in plain C which links to libgdiplus

</I>
Most of System.Drawing is only a small wrapper abound libgdiplus (or GDI
+ under Windows). Any bug will likely be inside libgdiplus so it's
&quot;normal&quot; (i.e. expected) that you get the same behavior.

&gt;<i> My tests show that even using unsynchronized GdipGetImageGraphicsContext 
</I>&gt;<i> / GdipDeleteGraphics (no fonts stuff touched) can easily lead to crashes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  From what I've seen, cairo seems to be thread-safe: see attached[1] 
</I>&gt;<i> `cairo-multi-thread-text.c'.
</I>
It's thread-safe as long as everything is created and executed in the
same thread. Otherwise it would not be safe-thread (just like .net and
most libraries are).

&gt;<i> Also, there's a few locking used around thread-unsafe fontconfig calls 
</I>&gt;<i> in libgdiplus itself.  I didn't examined the whole code, so there's 
</I>&gt;<i> possibly other places in it missing locking primitives.
</I>
Yep. Font-related code (and older, pre-1.4, versions of Cairo) had quite
a few problems (solved with the locking code). Other than that SWF and
ASP.NET were the big clients for SD/libgdiplus and, for SWF,
multithreading was not an issue at all.

&gt;<i> I would appreciate any help on this subject!
