<PRE>Not an easy answer.  The conclusion I have come to is that the UI most
always be rewritten for each platform.  One goal that I have when writing an
application is that it offers the best UI experience possible.  At least so
far, any cross platform UI is going to diminish the user's experience with
your application, which makes your application look inferior.  Separate the
logic as much as possible, but use native UI tools to develop the UI.

Thanks to mono we have the ability to reuse large portions of the library.
To me implementing the UI in native tools and recompiling is trivial
compared to the cost of writing in C, C++, Objective-C or using a
non-standard cross-platform GUI toolkit.

Bset of luck.
