It is possible to use the same X11 driver for Windows.Forms that is used on
Linux.  First, make sure the free X11 server is installed and running.  I
believe it is available on the OS X installation disk, but may not be
installed by default.  Then define the following environment variables when
starting a Mono application: DISPLAY=0.0 MONO_MWF_MAC_FORCE_X11=whatever.
Note that the X11 server for Mac is an application in its own right and all
X11 windows are associated with it rather than the client applications.

I am currently working on a Cocoa-based replacement for the Carbon Driver
that is the default implementation of Windows.Forms on OS X.  I hope that it
will eliminate some inefficiencies and some impediments to support of 64-bit
applications.  After I get it working as well as the Carbon Driver, I will
start filling in some of the missing pieces.
