<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> 1. If I understand correctly, there was a problem with a web server 
</I>&gt;<i> component of mono (was it mod_mono?) on Mac OSX, which effectively 
</I>&gt;<i> ruled out serving asp.net pages from a Mac OSX server. Does this 
</I>&gt;<i> problem still persist or did I misunderstand? If it does exist, does it 
</I>&gt;<i> only exist on Mac OSX and not on Linux? Can asp.net pages currently be 
</I>&gt;<i> served from Mac OSX?
</I>
That probably was the case a long time ago, but today we can serve apps
with mod_mono and xsp just fine from OSX.

&gt;<i> 2. I have a live web server, that is currently running on Windows 2000. 
</I>&gt;<i> On it, I have a few sites written in C#. Most of the code is compiled 
</I>&gt;<i> into dlls and user cotrols. They don't do anything amazing, just 
</I>&gt;<i> regular dynamic fare. How big are my chances, that these sites will 
</I>&gt;<i> function 1:1 on a Linux server running mono?
</I>
Very good.

The major problems faced today by developers are that they reference and
hardcode paths with &quot;\&quot; instead of Path.Separator or using Path.Combine
which will give you portable code.

The other problem is filename casing: your file is called &quot;Foo.aspx&quot; but
you reference it as &quot;foo.aspx&quot; from your pages.   This is only a problem
on case-sensitive file systems.

&gt;<i> 3. Is there a basic tutorial for installing Mono + whatever else it 
</I>&gt;<i> takes to get going with asp.net on Mac OSX somewhere on the net?
</I>
Install the Mono package, then follow the instructions to install
mod_mono.

&gt;<i> 4. Once mono is installed on Mac OSX, how can I compile dlls of .cs 
</I>&gt;<i> code files?
</I>
type:

	mcs -target:library foo.cs
