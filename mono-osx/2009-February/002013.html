Hi Martin!

&gt;<i>Do you have a mode that will not use the proxy-weaver based inheritance? 
</I>I'm debating adding one.  &gt;I realize it will make the generated proxies
pretty large, but I'm wondering how much larger it would &gt;make the compiled
binaries.  If  I had to guess, I'd think maybe 2x or 3x larger, which might
be a &gt;small price to pay to not have to rely on (as rodrigo mention) a Mono
CLR bug.

Without method duplication (with weaver) in proxy assemblies them takes
about 7MB on hard disk. After duplication assemplies takes about 60MB of
compiled code for each platform ( 120MB for Tiger+Leopard and will 180MB
with 10.6 =) ). It's anyway unaaceptable and is not small price. Anyway
there is another project - Monobjc where each objective-c class corresponds
to .NET class. But Laurent's approach not efficient enough - monobjc
internally used Dictinary for matching native and managed objects. Mine
approach eliminates need in such dictinary and overheads on object creation.

&gt;<i>I was taking a look at the code and it doesnt look like HeaderAnalyzer is
</I>used anymore.  It's looking &gt;like you extract all the method and property
information from the Objective-C runtime itself.  Is that &gt;true? the
HeaderAnalyzer.Analyze(..) method is commented out in ProfileBuilder.  Also
this means that &gt;NObjectiveAST seems like it's not being used.

HeaderAnalyzer+NObjectiveAST used to generate &quot;parsed_headers.xml&quot; (see
code). And since this file was generated I don't want spend time while
regenerating it. When Snow Leopard comes to market I'll uncomment that line
and generate &quot;parsed_headers.xml&quot; for Mac OS 10.6.

2Rodrigo:
&gt;<i>Encoding a OO type hierarchy using valuetypes is plain wrong.
</I>What about C++? Each class and struct is a value type but with inheritance
ability (and some others). Are programmers that designing their apps in C++
wrong?. Value types is most efficient way to combine memory management
schemes of Objective-C and Mono (see perftest on NObjective's main page).
Some of users told me that they don't want to attach to the Objective-C
object using managed counterpart, but want work with it as raw pointer. Only
value types can provide such ability.

&gt;<i>It's not a bug in mono, the CLR is designed this way and there is no
</I>compeling reason to implement such broken behavior.
Mono bug is crashes while accessing of virtual methods of boxed object that
not derived from ValueType/Enum. CLR ( CLR = MS CLI implementation ) able to
run such code and I have no idea why Mono JIT team can't emulate such
behaviour. Also CLR runtime verifier accepts such code coz it's VALID CIL
(but not verifiable). 

Mono internally used a thousands of different hacks so using of vtypes not
directly inherited from ValueType/Enum isn't criminal. 

WBR,
Eugeny Grishul
