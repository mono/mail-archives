<PRE>Matt,

&gt;<i> I guess I see Delphi as a step back now, after using C# for 4+  
</I>&gt;<i> years. I actually avoided .Net and C# for the longest time - with  
</I>&gt;<i> some weird notion that I was a dedicated &quot;Delphi programmer&quot;, but  
</I>&gt;<i> the switch is like night and day. I don't think I could go back.
</I>
Agreed. Delphi/Win32 is definitely a step back from C# and .NET.  
However, Delphi Prism is not Delphi/Win32, and it is (imho, and im not  
just saying that because im selling it ;), imho a step forward from  
C#. If nothing else, the language is a lot more advanced and feature  
rich and has many things C# developers can only dream about - while at  
the same time not missing out on a single feature that C# does have.

&gt;<i> I'm sure Mark won't take offence if I also say, using a VM to run  
</I>&gt;<i> Visual Studio and then running Interface Builder on the Mac is a  
</I>&gt;<i> complete and total kludge.
</I>
i somewhat agree, and somewhat disagree. i dislike having to use a VM,  
as well, but it's important to remember that &quot;real&quot; Mac developers  
using Xcode and Objective-C, too have Interface Builder as a separate  
application. So having IB external is pretty much &quot;by design&quot;, whether  
you have the extra barrier of the VM, or not. but yes, i too would  
love to get rid of needing VMware and Windows at all, and these days  
VS is just about the only thing i do use it for ;)

&gt;<i> A MonoDevelop version would really improve the situation, so let's  
</I>&gt;<i> hope that happens :-)
</I>
it exists now. we just cannot ship it while MD is under GPL. :(


yours,
marc
