<PRE>niknil a &#233;crit :

&gt;<i> God forbid :-)! The logic and UI are separated. All the logic will be
</I>&gt;<i> written in F# code, while the UI stuff that can't be done in F# will 
</I>&gt;<i> be C#,
</I>&gt;<i> with some C++ thrown in where raw speed is needed (for example 
</I>&gt;<i> decompressing
</I>&gt;<i> and bitmap rotation).
</I>
It sounds like you are wanting to do custom drawing and expect to do 
that code only once. Unfortunately, to get the best results for OS X, it 
is doubtful that you can use a single code base, unless you can figure 
on a way to get the drawing code to link to the Cocoa side of things.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure Delphi/Pascal has its advantages in some areas, but personally I
</I>&gt;<i> prefer languages and environments that are used by more people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>No fair!! :-) Delphi has been around for over ten years; a lot longer 
than C#; Pascal for even longer, with many, many users. In fact, since 
Delphi 2009, surveys are starting to show a revival in its use.

Anyway, Delphi Prism may have its roots in Pascal but it is every bit a 
modern .NET language with a really good fit for Mono development. What's 
more, you can easily add references to any other .NET assemblies, no 
matter what language they are written in.

However, I would agree that single source drawing code that copes with 
OS X could be hard to achieve.
