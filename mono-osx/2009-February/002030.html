I can't help you much with the key bindings.  I find my mac to be
infuriatingly inconsistent when it comes to key bindings across
applications, so I don't know what the &quot;correct&quot; bindings are really
supposed to be anyway.  Windows is far more consistent.

That being said, your list looks very good.  There are a few things
I've noticed that bother me:

* Window drawing/refresh issues (as you mentioned, but they are very
bad right now)

* In tree views and menus, your current item doesn't always highlight
(probably related to the window refresh issue)

* Dialog boxes open in the upper left corner of the screen.  This is
annoying because I have my dock on the left and the dialogs always
appear under the dock.

* I had to delete my ~/.config/MonoDevelop folder to get this build to
load.  Before I did that, I was getting the following error on
startup: LSOpenFromURLSpec() failed with error -10810

I only downloaded the newest build last night.  I haven't looked at
MonoDevelop on mac in months so I'll post more as I re-familiarize
myself with it and use it.
