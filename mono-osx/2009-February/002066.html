</I>Interface builder isn't a problem. The problem really is that Visual 
studio isn't a Mac app and so it doesn't feel &quot;right&quot;. More personal 
preference I guess. This and running Parallels on a Macbook vs Mac Pro = 
no fun at all.

Would this be for Delphi Prism or will C# be supported. Indeed, does 
Delphi Prism's templates and such include support for C# with regards to 
the Mac platform? I could see a pull for me on that front - supporting 
Mac C# dev in Visual studio, with real projects instead of hacks - this 
would be something I'd pay for. It would be bundled, but also could be 
available stand alone. If it was stand alone, I don't see it being an 
expensively priced product. Financially, it would possibly not be worth 
developing, but what a gift it could be to the Mac community if it was 
free :-) How about it? Code bounty?
