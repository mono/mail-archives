</I>With all due respect, surely this is akin to breaking a walnut with a 
sledgehammer? As valid a language/syntax as Pascal is, for a C# or 
VB.Net based programmer, I would have to point out, it's not really 
relevant to this discussion. It also implies an additional cost because 
the Delphi Prism product is not free to use in this way - you only get a 
command line compiler free, unless this changed in the last month. You 
would also require a valid Microsoft Windows license and a paid for 
Virtual Machine to make the experience pleasant (unless Virtual Box is 
improved over my last test..) I don't know about you, but as a Mac user, 
I use Mac OS X because I don't want to make my life complex and have no 
wish to get involved with Microsoft Windows. Further to that, Visual 
Studio will run under emulation and as good as that can be, it is 
distasteful to many Mac users. Until it is a fully Mac native solution, 
it's not really a solution.. it's a work around at best.

OP: you could try GTK#... not perfect, but is does a reasonable job on 
all platforms.
