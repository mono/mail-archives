Why is Mono on OS X a &quot;Windows solution&quot;? If one uses an Objective-C 
bridge, no Windows specific code needs to come in to the equation.

Neither. For me, Mono != Windows programming, and Windows Programming 
does not seem to be the only objective of Mono. Though compatibility may 
be a goal, a Mono programmer can write entire application suites without 
compiling or running a single line on Windows. Maybe, here-in lies the 
problem with your perception of what Mono is? :-)

&gt;<i> If you have no wish to get involved with Windows, why aren't you

</I>&gt;<i> a native solution&gt;?
</I>
Simplicity. I write C# code for a living. I love Objective-C, but 
sometimes it's quicker to use what you are most familiar with.... &lt;shrugs&gt;
