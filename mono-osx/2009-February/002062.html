<PRE>No need to boil blood. I did use Delphi for 10 years, 8 of which were  
professional, one university, one part time for legacy product  
support. I enjoyed of a lot, but I saw Borland travel from the high of  
Delphi 1, to the low of Delphi 2005 and the awful new IDE. Once  
bitten, and all that.

At any rate, here's to Remobjects and Embarcadero(?) creating a  
thriving Object Pascal community. Till then, C# serves me well ;-)

Sorry for top posting, but have you ever tried to delete over quoted  
emails on an iPhone? Nightmare!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Very good.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I find Delphi more convincing every time I read about it! Ever since
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the .NET Rocks podcast episode about Prism I was sort of hooked.
</I>&gt;<i> Speaking as someone who did Delphi for about 10 years professionally
</I>&gt;<i> (programming and I did a stint as a trainer too), I can say Object
</I>&gt;<i> Pascal is a very nice language. There are probably 2 features I miss
</I>&gt;<i> from Object Pascal - real Sets (ooooh, sets!!) and being allowed to  
</I>&gt;<i> use
</I>&gt;<i> and Delphi Enumerations - especially using enumerated types as the  
</I>&gt;<i> index
</I>&gt;<i> bounds of an array. Maybe there's one or two other minor things, but
</I>&gt;<i> those two I miss regularly in C#.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having said that, Delphi is pretty much a dead end in my world these
</I>&gt;<i> days. I'm not clear why Delphi Prism is any better than the Win32
</I>&gt;<i> language - I remember Chrome/Whatever it was renamed, on which the  
</I>&gt;<i> Prism
</I>&gt;<i> compiler is based, updated the language syntax. But Borland didn't
</I>&gt;<i> support that, so it was all a bit pointless if you wanted to share  
</I>&gt;<i> code
</I>&gt;<i> between Win32 and .Net via that route. Borland also did have their own
</I>&gt;<i> ,Net compiler for the Object Pascal language, except it generated
</I>&gt;<i> horrible oddly Win32 specific code IIRC. I lost interest by the Delphi
</I>&gt;<i> 2005 release, so it might have improved, but I'm not really sure to be
</I>&gt;<i> honest.. Delphi Prism isn't going to open many doors to jobs in
</I>&gt;<i> traditional Delphi, because the language syntax has changed both  
</I>&gt;<i> subtly
</I>&gt;<i> and extensively in different ways to the core Borland product. The
</I>&gt;<i> question is - are there Prism jobs out here? I have no idea. I have no
</I>&gt;<i> axe to grind though, so your experience might be entirely different. I
</I>&gt;<i> guess I see Delphi as a step back now, after using C# for 4+ years. I
</I>&gt;<i> actually avoided .Net and C# for the longest time - with some weird
</I>&gt;<i> notion that I was a dedicated &quot;Delphi programmer&quot;, but the switch is
</I>&gt;<i> like night and day. I don't think I could go back.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure Mark won't take offence if I also say, using a VM to run  
</I>&gt;<i> Visual
</I>&gt;<i> Studio and then running Interface Builder on the Mac is a complete and
</I>&gt;<i> total kludge. A MonoDevelop version would really improve the  
</I>&gt;<i> situation,
</I>&gt;<i> so let's hope that happens :-)
