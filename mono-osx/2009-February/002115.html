It's a Mac mentality these days. NeXT solved the problem with the bundles
concept. It's still a whole bunch of files, but it looks like one file and
can easily be copied (and installed by simply copying).

I don't know how Linux wants its programs to be delivered (installer? RPM?
?) but I guess the Windows installer should install, into the program files
directory a bundle.app containing everything needed to run the program on
Windows and Mac OS X, and create a shortcut for the program menu. The root
directory of the bundle should also contain a shortcut creator for Windows.

The Apple version should be distributed as a bundle.

This has the advantage of two versions for two platforms that both behave
completely native, but are still interchangeable. I can copy the installed
Windows version onto a Mac and it will be a bundle (because it is). And I
can copy the Mac version (or installed Windows version) to a Windows
computer's program files folder and run the shortcut creator and have a
working Windows version again.

Does anybody know how Linux should best be supported in this way?

Very good. I really like Visual Studio. It's perfect for amateurs like
myself.

Objective-C 2.0 doesn't work on 10.4 and earlier, I think. (Or is it 1.3 and
earlier.) And I believe the iPhone doesn't support Objective-C 2.0 at all.

One advantage of using Objective-C is that the application can easily be
ported to the iPhone (if it makes sense for the program). But I hear Novell
have a solution for running .NET binaries on the iPhone hard-linked with
Mono using Windows Forms or Silverlight/Moonlight. So that advantage of
Objective-C's might not be relevant any more.

My experiences with the Compact Framework was limited to finding out that
Windows Mobile 5 supported .NET 1.1 and cannot be updated (at least on my HP
device) and that Visual Studio 2005 (the earliest I have and I refuse to
downgrade) supported .NET 2.0 and upwards. Hence I could never develop for
Windows Mobile and gave up. Apple seem to be a lot better with the software
update thing for mobile devices. The combination Xcode/iPhone works for me.

Thanks for all the input.

I'll be going with Delphi Prism. I am just waiting for Apple to release new
desktop machines because I need more than 3 GB of memory to use VMware
better. Plus I need more x86 hardware so I can play StarCraft 2!!! :-)
