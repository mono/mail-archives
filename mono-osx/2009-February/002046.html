Very good.

I find Delphi more convincing every time I read about it! Ever since
the .NET Rocks podcast episode about Prism I was sort of hooked.

<A HREF="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=409">http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=409</A>

But you know the episode, you were in it! :-)

(Wie geht's so in Berlin?)


&gt;<i> You can download a template for a Monobjc ap at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://remobjects.com/prismextras">http://remobjects.com/prismextras</A>
</I>
I'll have a look!

&gt;<i> Matter of fact, we're moving towards recommending Monobjc as the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;recommended&quot; way to do Cocoa apps in Prism (i know, the mobjc and
</I>&gt;<i> NSWhatever guys will come in to complain that thier stuff is better ;-).
</I>&gt;<i> When i spoke to Geoff at PDC he also recommended Monobjc as the most
</I>&gt;<i> complete and best solution to work with.
</I>
I think we are getting somewhere.

I am looking for a way to write applications that are portable between
Windows and Mac OS X, ideally use Cocoa, and are garbage-collected.

I have been using REALbasic for years, and am thinking about learning
Python. I don't like Java and Java doesn't use Cocoa. I use Visual
Studio at work.


&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can something be done about this on Novell's side?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Would it be remotely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible to unite the three different projects under one banner and make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them part of Mono?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i'd love to see this happen and have all the different fronts that people
</I>&gt;<i> are working n for Obj-C/Mono bridging to be united. Mono/OS X development is
</I>&gt;<i> a tiny niche of Mono usage in general, as it stands now (as much as i'd love
</I>&gt;<i> that to change),
</I>
I am sure it will change. I think there is a positively huge market
for decent cross-platform applications.


&gt;<i> so having four different teams/people going off in
</I>&gt;<i> different directions to further split this up, rather than working towards a
</I>&gt;<i> common goal of having one &quot;standard&quot; way to build Cocoa apps in Mono (and
</I>&gt;<i> one that could then be &quot;four times better&quot; than what we have now!) seems
</I>&gt;<i> silly, at the least, and &#160;waste of everyone's time, at worst.
</I>
Yes.

And in the mean time REALbasic still doesn't support Cocoa and QT
would force me to learn C++.


&gt;&gt;<i> And what about official support in MonoDevelop or some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> module for Xcode?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'd pay a few hundred euros for a solution. Maybe a few others want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> join
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and we could offer a bounty?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i/we'd definitely be willing to contribute a bounty to any of the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - getting the bridges unified and moved forward
</I>&gt;<i> - getting managed compilers into Xcode (esp if done in a language agnostic
</I>&gt;<i> way so that the same work could be leveraged for Prism, next to C#)
</I>&gt;<i> - getting MonoDevelop out from under the GPL (coz the second it is, we can
</I>&gt;<i> ship full Prism support for it).
</I>
I'd be content with a Visual Studio plug-in that supports Mono and
Monobjc. But I am willing to spend money and learn Delphi if this is
the best way for me to get what I want. I liked Turbo Pascal.

(I am a build engineer, not a programmer. All of this is about my
hobby projects. That's why I am looking for easy-to-use solutions.)
