<PRE>Matt Emson a &#233;crit :

&gt;<i> With all due respect, surely this is akin to breaking a walnut with a 
</I>&gt;<i> sledgehammer? As valid a language/syntax as Pascal is, for a C# or 
</I>&gt;<i> VB.Net based programmer, I would have to point out, it's not really 
</I>&gt;<i> relevant to this discussion.
</I>
I suppose I am used to being the kind of programmer who uses whatever 
languae it takes to do the job. I now find I am having to use 
ObjectiveC, which seemed very foreign at first, no matter what language 
you come from :-)

&gt;<i> It also implies an additional cost because the Delphi Prism product is 
</I>&gt;<i> not free to use in this way - you only get a command line compiler 
</I>&gt;<i> free, unless this changed in the last month. You would also require a 
</I>&gt;<i> valid Microsoft Windows license and a paid for Virtual Machine to make 
</I>&gt;<i> the experience pleasant (unless Virtual Box is improved over my last 
</I>&gt;<i> test..)
</I>
Yes, it costs to buy these products but, as a professional developer, 
such costs are to be expected... unless you are a hobby programmer.

&gt;<i> I don't know about you, but as a Mac user, I use Mac OS X because I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't want to make my life complex and have no wish to get involved 
</I>&gt;<i> with Microsoft Windows. Further to that, Visual Studio will run under 
</I>&gt;<i> emulation and as good as that can be, it is distasteful to many Mac 
</I>&gt;<i> users. Until it is a fully Mac native solution, it's not really a 
</I>&gt;<i> solution.. it's a work around at best.
</I>
If you are a Mac user, I have to ask you why you are looking at, what is 
essentially, a Windows solution?

I agree that C# and the .NET libraries are much easier to get to know 
than ObjectiveC but are you expecting to write apps primarily for 
Windows that can run on Mac, or the other way around?

If you have no wish to get involved with Windows, why aren't you looking 
at using the &quot;native&quot; Mac solution of ObjectiveC, or even Java?

Discuss :-)
