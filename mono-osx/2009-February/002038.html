In contrast, Monodevelop *is* worth my time. I am in awe about how
mature of a platform it has become... and wish I could do more to
contribute to making the os/x experience better.

Honestly, I wish it were a lot less kludge-like on OS/X, simply
because there are no other .net development tools (native UI or not).
I don't like to leave OS/X for any reason (other than integration
testing). Even transitioning to an XP instance in a VM is a headache.

Personally, it doesn't really bother me that MonoDevelop looks like a
winforms app on OS/X....   99% of the time, I am doing one of two
things in the IDE...  

1 - writing code or using a designer (winforms, asp.net)
2 - debugging

....Neither of which really benefits from native-UI integration all
that much. The menu placements, etc would make it a bit more seamless,
but certainly will not help the overall experience if the designers
and debuggers aren't working.

Good dialogue though!

MonoDevelop is not worth my time.  It is very unstable on OSX.  The UI
metaphor is kludgy.  It looks and feels like a non-native Mac app.
I'd
prefer MonoDevelop practiced what I preach.  In my opinion there is no
good
cross platform *UI* technology.  If you have a Windows app, use
WinForms.
If you have a Mac app, use InterfaceBuilder.  Based on that assumption
(and
opinion), MonoDevelop should be developed using InterfaceBuilder for
the UI
with a C# backend utilizing one of the bridges.

This design is exactly what we implement for our cross platform app.
Two
native UIs, one common library.  Both apps look and feel great on
their
respective platforms.  So right now I have Win7 Beta installed on my
Parallels virtual machine.  I use Visual Studio there and Interface
Builder
on the Mac.  It requires one extra compile but the productivity of
Visual
Studio and the native look and feel thanks to IB are well worth the
extra
step.

Time is money.  The power of Visual Studio saves a lot of time.  If I
get an
Objective-C plugin for VS I would love that!  Never use XCode again.
