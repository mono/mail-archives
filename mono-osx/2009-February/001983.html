There seems to be a consensus about this, so I'll drop my OS X plans. My
project is too much of a niche application to motivate spending lots of time
making an OS X version of it.

I'll probably make a Linux version without too much effort though, since
Linux users are used to weird looking UIs anyway.

God forbid :-)! The logic and UI are separated. All the logic will be
written in F# code, while the UI stuff that can't be done in F# will be C#,
with some C++ thrown in where raw speed is needed (for example decompressing
and bitmap rotation).

I'm sure Delphi/Pascal has its advantages in some areas, but personally I
prefer languages and environments that are used by more people.
