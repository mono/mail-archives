<PRE>Mac Programmer a &#233;crit :

&gt;<i> Dependence on a .nib file troubles me. I don't like that it's not  
</I>&gt;<i> human readable
</I>
Actually, the new XIB file format is human-readable XML, although 
human-understandable is not as easy :-)

&gt;<i> One of the more interesting aspects of Prism is that it's apparently  
</I>&gt;<i> able to read .nib files in order to auto-generate the partial design  
</I>&gt;<i> class each time you modify the .nib in IB. That strikes me as a  
</I>&gt;<i> fairly impressive feat.
</I>
Having examined the XIB format, I would agree that someone obviously 
needs a medal :-)

&gt;<i> I appreciate that a .nib contains serialized objects and is not a  
</I>&gt;<i> representation of the UI the way, say, a Delphi .dfm file is, but it  
</I>&gt;<i> seems kind of archaic. I wonder if it's really just a throw-back to  
</I>&gt;<i> some ancient time when computers were much slower than today.
</I>
But, Delphi .dfm and VS .designer files are really serializations of the 
form, it's just that they use a more &quot;coder-friendly&quot; format. After all, 
  if you have a visual designer, why would you want to read the 
underlying data? Sounds to me like you don't trust the developers of the 
designer ;-)

&gt;<i> I like having something other than just the visual part to look at.  
</I>&gt;<i> Code is fine, as is a .dfm file or something like that. One of  
</I>&gt;<i> my .dfm files is 6,000 single-spaced lines, but I can open it with a  
</I>&gt;<i> text editor and read it like a novel.
</I>
So, you are designing a visual UI - why do you need to see the code? 
Unless you are hooked on writing business logic in the UI..... &lt;g&gt;
