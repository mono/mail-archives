<PRE>Mono is not a Windows technology.  C# is a language started by Microsoft
that includes the WinForm library, which *that* library is tailored for
Windows.  C# is a language.  Mono is the compiler for that language on other
platforms.  And there are ports of the Windows centric UI WinForm library to
other platforms.  My opinion is thinking a WinForm app can be a good cross
platform app is flawed.

We had this (frustrating) debate internally a few months ago.  The biggest
mind set shift was people letting go of C# equals Windows.  It does not
unless you code it that way.  We have an excellent middle layer that serves
a Windows WinForms application as well as a ObjC/Interface Builder
application.

The cost of writing the UI code twice is trivial when compared to the
benefit of having a truly native looking app on both platforms.  And if you
want you can easily call into the ObjC libraries from within a C#
application.  If you haven't look at MonoObjc.net.

Delphi Prism sounds interesting and warrants some investigation though.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why is Mono on OS X a &quot;Windows solution&quot;? If one uses an Objective-C
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bridge, no Windows specific code needs to come in to the equation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My point is that Mono is, essentially, a Windows technology that has
</I>&gt;<i> been (superbly) adapted to work on other platforms.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, the Mono frameworks include WinForms UI technology, which
</I>&gt;<i> is far from cross-platform; it is firmly rooted in Windows for its
</I>&gt;<i> appearance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, there is the MonoMate project, which allows the development of OS X
</I>&gt;<i> apps in C#; but with the same limitation of having to use Interface
</I>&gt;<i> Builder for the UI side of things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only conclusion I can reach, at the minute, is that Mono is s uperb
</I>&gt;<i> idea for developing apps for OS X, as long as you don't expect to do
</I>&gt;<i> *any* UI work in C#, etc. As others have said, the Cocoa UI is fairly
</I>&gt;<i> unique and, so far, there is nothing that allows the development of a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;single source&quot; UIs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I agree that C# and the .NET libraries are much easier to get to know
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; than ObjectiveC but are you expecting to write apps primarily for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Windows that can run on Mac, or the other way around?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Neither. For me, Mono != Windows programming, and Windows Programming
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; does not seem to be the only objective of Mono. Though compatibility
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; may be a goal, a Mono programmer can write entire application suites
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without compiling or running a single line on Windows. Maybe, here-in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lies the problem with your perception of what Mono is? :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My perception of Mono is of a superb effort to allow folks to use, what
</I>&gt;<i> started as, the .NET framework and languages like C# to create the
</I>&gt;<i> business logic for any application and to have that code available to
</I>&gt;<i> Windows, Linux, OS X and more.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, creating a UI is another matter and, as good as Mono is
</I>&gt;<i> for non-visual programming, it does not contain a valid UI building
</I>&gt;<i> solution that will work for all platforms; for that we still have to use
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;native&quot; tools for each platform if we are to get the expected user
</I>&gt;<i> experience.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Simplicity. I write C# code for a living. I love Objective-C, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sometimes it's quicker to use what you are most familiar with....
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;shrugs&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Quicker maybe and, since I have also been doing more C# work than
</I>&gt;<i> anything else for the last four years, I would agree that it is a
</I>&gt;<i> superb, easy to use, language; coming from Delphi and acknowledging that
</I>&gt;<i> the language has some of its origins in that language, I find no problem
</I>&gt;<i> in switching back and forth between the two (except for the usual = ==
</I>&gt;<i> := problems)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, I get paid to use what the client wants me to use so, at
</I>&gt;<i> present, I am writing in C#, Delphi Prism and ObjectiveC, sometimes all
</I>&gt;<i> in the same day. Now, that certainly keeps the brain agile :-)
