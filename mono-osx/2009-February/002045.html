<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I may be missing something but I do not see the advantage of Delphi Prism
</I>&gt;<i> (which may just be a personal preference ). &#160;Yes the CLR can
</I>&gt;<i> be utilized through various languages.
</I>
I think the advantage is that those guys actually try to support Cocoa
in a .NET IDE. I am considering buying it and learning Delphi.


&gt;<i> &#160;But the one language that is
</I>&gt;<i> relevant (at least to me) is C#. &#160;Not Pascal, C++ or VB. &#160;Yes the syntax of
</I>&gt;<i> object pascal may be similar and yes it may have additional features not
</I>&gt;<i> found in C#. &#160;But it is not C#. &#160;I do not want to learn yet another
</I>&gt;<i> language.
</I>
True, but who will give us the integration so that we can focus on the
program and not the build process? Apple are not interested and Novell
have other priorities.


&gt;<i> The &quot;solution&quot; I'm looking for is a native Mac IDE that integrates nicely
</I>&gt;<i> with Interface Builder where the language is C#, utilizing one of the
</I>&gt;<i> bridges, Monobjc, mobjc, etc. &#160;My current environment is virtual Win7 Visual
</I>&gt;<i> Studio, mobjc, and Interface Builder.
</I>
I like Visual Studio. A Monobjc-plugin for Visual Studio would be a
good solution for me.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks everyone for the ongoing discussions and opinions... I try to keep an
</I>&gt;<i> open mind.
</I>
Any thoughts on the idea of a bounty for such a plugin and what it
would have to do?

Perhaps we can convince the actual Mono team to support such a plugin
if we come up with a bounty? I would gladly give two or three hundred
Euros. If anybody else is interested, it might become worth the while
of someone familiar with Monobjc, Mono, and Visual Studio to provide
it.
