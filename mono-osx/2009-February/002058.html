I hope the quoting isn't messed up. I find it weird that a Web interface to a
mailing list archive would use a different quoting scheme than mail
programs!

I'll be busy with other stuff until May. If until then I hear two more good
things about Prism, one of which related to Cocoa, I'll buy it! :-) Your
example up there doesn't count for the two.

If you guys add more support for Cocoa (Monobjc), that's exactly what I am
looking for. And learning Delphi cannot be more unproductive than learning
REALbasic. :)

(I understand Delphi Prism just adds itself to an existing installation of
Visual Studio Professional if found?)

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I managed to write a program in C# that checks the platform it's running on
and uses Cocoa on Mac OS X and Windows Forms on Windows. It was an
interesting exercise but it's ultimately useless as the NIB file required
the program to be in a Mac bundle anyway and it cannot be shipped that way
on Windows.

Hence two or three different binaries will be the way to go. (Is there a way
to use #IFDEF to organise those different build settings in the source?)

There is more demand for Mac applications than ever, I think. And with .NET
we are a good step closer to cross-platform code.

Do you know if this will be a separate product or something that can be used
by existing Delphi Prism customers?
