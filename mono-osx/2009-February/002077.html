<PRE>Andrew,

&gt;<i> Quick question:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How does Prism interact with the Monobjc dlls? Where does it get  
</I>&gt;<i> them? Does
</I>&gt;<i> it add them to Monobjc-based projects?
</I>
same as C# would - you add them as references to your project

&gt;<i> And how does Prism handle projects that are supposed to have some  
</I>&gt;<i> files in
</I>&gt;<i> common (non-GUI) and some not (GUI controllers)?
</I>
basically, you'd create three separate projects - a dll with shared  
code, and then two front-end .exes, one of which would provide WPF or  
WinForms UI, the other Cocoa with Monobjc. If properly abstracted, the  
two exes can be pure presentation layer, with all the business logic  
being in the shared dll.

as mentioned before, one thing i got the idea of looking into,  
yesterday, was to create a sample that uses the MVVM pattern with WPF  
and Cocoa frontend - using a smart aspect to provide the property  
binding as needed. lets' see when i'll find the time to look at that ;)

yours,
marc
