No reason to be &quot;afraid&quot; that I'm right, because as far as I'm concerned,
it's a very good thing Mono doesn't require you to modify your code. :)
Of course, the exception is when something is not supported or buggy in Mono
(I recently read something like 70% of the .NET classes are implemented in
Mono. For the rest, you'd have to look for alternatives, possibly Mono APIs,
which can also run with .NET on Windows), or when directly calling Win32
DLLs, which naturally prevents your app from being cross platform.

And to clear things up a bit: the C# Mono compiler doesn't produce the
*exact* same binary code as the .NET one. Some benchmarks actually show some
things that run faster or slower depending on whether the exe has been
compiled with .NET or Mono. There are also rare bugs where a .NET exe won't
run with Mono on Linux, and a Mono exe won't run with .NET on Windows... but
that's quite rare as far as I know, and probably bound to happen less and
less as Mono gets more mature.
