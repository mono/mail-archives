<PRE>Andrew,

&gt;<i> Yes, but I mean when Prism compiles the project using Mono and  
</I>&gt;<i> macpacks it,
</I>&gt;<i> will it copy those DLLs into the bundle.app?
</I>
yes. all Copy-Local references will be copied into the bundle. there's  
also a special Build Action type to specify other resources to be  
copied.

&gt;<i> That's a good idea. In my previous experiments I always tried to make
</I>&gt;<i> everything one project. But that actually made it harder to keep GUI  
</I>&gt;<i> code
</I>&gt;<i> and business logic (&quot;model&quot;) separate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the Mac side having a DLL and an EXE is not a big problem as both  
</I>&gt;<i> will be
</I>&gt;<i> in the bundle anyway. And Windows expects an installer, I suppose,  
</I>&gt;<i> where I
</I>&gt;<i> can add the DLL (which I can reference from the Bin/Release folder  
</I>&gt;<i> of the
</I>&gt;<i> DLL project, I suppose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So to avoid confusion, it would work like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. DLL project, NO GUI code, just a bunch of classes and methods for  
</I>&gt;<i> model
</I>&gt;<i> stuff. References whatever that code needs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Winforms project, references the DLL compiled from 1. Compiles  
</I>&gt;<i> into an
</I>&gt;<i> EXE that comes with that DLL. Must create installer that contains  
</I>&gt;<i> EXE and
</I>&gt;<i> DLL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Monobjc project, references the DLL compiled from 1 and Monobjc
</I>&gt;<i> libraries. Compiles into an EXE and ultimately macpacks into a  
</I>&gt;<i> bundle.app
</I>&gt;<i> containing the EXE, the DLL, and the NIB file.
</I>
makes sense, yes.

&gt;<i> (Will Prism handle the
</I>&gt;<i> macpack?
</I>
yes.

&gt;<i> How will I add the NIB file to the project?
</I>
the first NIB is there when you create the project from template. we  
dont currently have a template for additional NIBs (so youll need to  
add those manually, for now), but we'll address that

&gt;<i> Can Prism pack Mono
</I>&gt;<i> into the bundle.app so the program will run on unsuspecting Macs?)
</I>
not currently/automatically no. you'll need to do that manually using  
the bundling instructions on the mono site.

&gt;<i> The only downside is that using that method I won't have a single  
</I>&gt;<i> EXE with
</I>&gt;<i> no DLL requirement that will run on both platforms (and look  
</I>&gt;<i> terrible on the
</I>&gt;<i> Mac).
</I>
you could always just add the .pas source files for the shared code to  
both the .exe and the Mac DLL *or to both exes). not &quot;the .NET way&quot; to  
do things, but feasible.

&gt;<i> But I can add a fourth project if I want to support Linux and Gtk#.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This will be more work on the GUI side than using REALbasic, but  
</I>&gt;<i> will give
</I>&gt;<i> me Cocoa (REALbasic uses Carbon), the power of the .NET framework  
</I>&gt;<i> and (on
</I>&gt;<i> the Mac) access to Cocoa APIs, and through the CLR a way to run the
</I>&gt;<i> resulting binaries on even more platforms than supported by REALbasic
</I>&gt;<i> (Windows x86, Mac OS X, Linux x86). Plus the extra work for the GUI
</I>&gt;<i> translates into better-looking GUIs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think it's a good trade-off.
</I>
indeed. ding proper UI for each platform will always be more work, but  
it'll be worth it, for having a Mac app that doesn't suck. ;)

yours,
marc
