<PRE>Matt Emson a &#233;crit :

&gt;&gt;<i> If you are a Mac user, I have to ask you why you are looking at, what 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is essentially, a Windows solution?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why is Mono on OS X a &quot;Windows solution&quot;? If one uses an Objective-C 
</I>&gt;<i> bridge, no Windows specific code needs to come in to the equation.
</I>
My point is that Mono is, essentially, a Windows technology that has 
been (superbly) adapted to work on other platforms.

Unfortunately, the Mono frameworks include WinForms UI technology, which 
is far from cross-platform; it is firmly rooted in Windows for its 
appearance.

Now, there is the MonoMate project, which allows the development of OS X 
apps in C#; but with the same limitation of having to use Interface 
Builder for the UI side of things.

The only conclusion I can reach, at the minute, is that Mono is s uperb 
idea for developing apps for OS X, as long as you don't expect to do 
*any* UI work in C#, etc. As others have said, the Cocoa UI is fairly 
unique and, so far, there is nothing that allows the development of a 
&quot;single source&quot; UIs.

&gt;&gt;<i> I agree that C# and the .NET libraries are much easier to get to know 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than ObjectiveC but are you expecting to write apps primarily for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Windows that can run on Mac, or the other way around?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Neither. For me, Mono != Windows programming, and Windows Programming 
</I>&gt;<i> does not seem to be the only objective of Mono. Though compatibility 
</I>&gt;<i> may be a goal, a Mono programmer can write entire application suites 
</I>&gt;<i> without compiling or running a single line on Windows. Maybe, here-in 
</I>&gt;<i> lies the problem with your perception of what Mono is? :-)
</I>
My perception of Mono is of a superb effort to allow folks to use, what 
started as, the .NET framework and languages like C# to create the 
business logic for any application and to have that code available to 
Windows, Linux, OS X and more.

Unfortunately, creating a UI is another matter and, as good as Mono is 
for non-visual programming, it does not contain a valid UI building 
solution that will work for all platforms; for that we still have to use 
&quot;native&quot; tools for each platform if we are to get the expected user 
experience.

&gt;<i> Simplicity. I write C# code for a living. I love Objective-C, but 
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes it's quicker to use what you are most familiar with.... &lt;shrugs&gt;
</I>
Quicker maybe and, since I have also been doing more C# work than 
anything else for the last four years, I would agree that it is a 
superb, easy to use, language; coming from Delphi and acknowledging that 
the language has some of its origins in that language, I find no problem 
in switching back and forth between the two (except for the usual = == 
:<i>= problems)
</I>
However, I get paid to use what the client wants me to use so, at 
present, I am writing in C#, Delphi Prism and ObjectiveC, sometimes all 
in the same day. Now, that certainly keeps the brain agile :-)
