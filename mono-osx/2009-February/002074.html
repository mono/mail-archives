<PRE>Andrew Brehm a &#233;crit :

&gt;<i> I thought Delphi would bring a few Delphi-specific classes, like Visual
</I>&gt;<i> Basic.
</I>
What classes were you expecting? Don't forget that Delphi Prism is 
mainly a compiler and doesn't include anything like the VCL; instead it 
uses the FCL and any other .NET components that are available.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I don't like MonoDevelop on Mac OS X.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it's not perfect, no. ideally, i'd like to have Prism in Xcode, which  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> i love (and actually prefer over VS).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That would be awesome, yes.
</I>
Certainly, the best possible option would be to be able to use a .NET 
compiler in XCode, but that would also have to include both code 
insight/completion and debugging. That is the biggest shortfall in 
Delphi Prism or, come to that any, Mono IDE.
