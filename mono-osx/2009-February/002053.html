<PRE>Andrew,

&gt;<i> I find Delphi more convincing every time I read about it! Ever since
</I>&gt;<i> the .NET Rocks podcast episode about Prism I was sort of hooked.
</I>
glad to hear that. i believe we have a lot of cool stuff in Prism that  
sets it apart from C# - not just it's support for Mono(objc). For  
example, have a look at our upcoming support for AOP: <A HREF="http://blogs.remobjects.com/blogs/mh/2009/02/06/p253">http://blogs.remobjects.com/blogs/mh/2009/02/06/p253</A> 
  (shows on an example that's very relevant to Monobjc, too ;)

&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=409">http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=409</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But you know the episode, you were in it! :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Wie geht's so in Berlin?)
</I>
cold ;)

&gt;&gt;<i> Matter of fact, we're moving towards recommending Monobjc as the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;recommended&quot; way to do Cocoa apps in Prism (i know, the mobjc and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> NSWhatever guys will come in to complain that thier stuff is  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better ;-).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When i spoke to Geoff at PDC he also recommended Monobjc as the most
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> complete and best solution to work with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we are getting somewhere.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am looking for a way to write applications that are portable between
</I>&gt;<i> Windows and Mac OS X, ideally use Cocoa, and are garbage-collected.
</I>
very doable, yes. one of the things i was thinking about just today  
was doing a nice sample that (aided by a variation of the Aspect i  
describe in the blog post above) would show an application that has a  
WPB MVVM and a Monobjc Cocoa frontend both based on the same  
modelview. (The aspect would publish the properties according to KVO  
when using Monobjc, and as bindable properties for WPF, when using  
that...

&gt;&gt;<i> i'd love to see this happen and have all the different fronts that  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are working n for Obj-C/Mono bridging to be united. Mono/OS X  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> development is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a tiny niche of Mono usage in general, as it stands now (as much as  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> i'd love
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that to change),
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am sure it will change. I think there is a positively huge market
</I>&gt;<i> for decent cross-platform applications.
</I>
i believe so too, yes.

&gt;<i> I'd be content with a Visual Studio plug-in that supports Mono and
</I>&gt;<i> Monobjc. But I am willing to spend money and learn Delphi if this is
</I>&gt;<i> the best way for me to get what I want. I liked Turbo Pascal.
</I>
inside VS, i dare say that is the best option, yes. Until we can ship  
our MD support...


yours,
marc
