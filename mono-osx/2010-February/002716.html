I assume by &quot;2.2.1&quot; you mean the MonoDevelop IDE.

Printing support has for a couple of years depended on old Linux-only
libraries, so only worked on Linux - and only when built with certain
flags. But we didn't get many complaints - hence why you got few
search results - so it's been fairly low-priority for us to fix
compared to other issues. The issue was mitigated by the fact that
text copied from MD could be pasted as syntax-highlighted RTF - though
this doesn't seem to work with the Mac.

I recently did a quick port of MD's print code to use the more recent
crossplatform GTK print APIs, and this is included in the &quot;beta&quot; that
you can find in the MD Mac updater. On Mac, GTK still can't actually
print directly, but &quot;print preview&quot; works by displaying a PDF file in
the Mac Preview app, which can then be used to print it.

I've been hoping that someone who's interested in the printing support
could step up to add some more features, such as wrapping,
customizable font size, customizable margins and header/footer. The
code is very straightforward, and many options are effectively
implemented and simply need a GUI.
