I few months ago I started a thread about what to expect from Delphi Prism.

I have since then experimented with Delphi Prism and came to the conclusion
(so far) that it is the ideal language for cross-platform .NET development.

I have blogged about my experiences (one so far) here:

<A HREF="http://leaukiprog.blogspot.com/2009/07/delphi-prism-first-experiment.html">http://leaukiprog.blogspot.com/2009/07/delphi-prism-first-experiment.html</A>

Accessing the Cocoa API from Pascal looks very clean and I find it easier
than keeping track of such calls in C# and VB.

The Delphi people are very helpful and seem genuinely interested
specifically in Mono development for Mac OS.

Note that Prism's excellent support for Mono and Mac OS is due to Monoobjc.
Those guys did really great work. It cannot be said often enough.

Using Cocoa from .NET is now really easy and not much different from using
Windows.Forms.

In the next few days I will look into Gtk#. Apparently my Linux VM runs
Glade 3 now.
