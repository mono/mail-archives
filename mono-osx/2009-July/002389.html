Hi,

Thanks for your support.

I don't think I could get back to the matter in a while, but most 
probably will give it another try in a month or two.

&gt;<i> According to Monobjc's documentation, it supports Cocoa classes NSStatusBar
</I>&gt;<i> and NSStatusItem.  I've read that Cocoa-sharp has not been maintained for
</I>&gt;<i> some time.  NObjective claims to support bidirectional exception
</I>&gt;<i> translation.  It includes a translator that uses info from Objective C
</I>&gt;<i> Introspection to build or update a bridge for an whole framework at a time.
</I>
I have some experience with Monobjc and it works OK for me.  Tried 
mcocoa once, but didn't get past nib-files loading (but it's not needed 
for WinForms).  We can try all of them to make the best choice.
