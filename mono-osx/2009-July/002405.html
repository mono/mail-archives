<PRE>
I've been using mod_mono sweetness on OSX using the built-in apache server
for over a year now.  I really wish they'd just compile mod_mono with the
osx binaries..  I've tried to get fastcgi working to no avail.. though I
hear that fastcgi doesn't work well on apache even on linux.. *shrug*

There's many issues getting a mod_mono running with the built-in os x apache
server in leopard.  First, leopard has 64-bit apache where the mono binaries
are 32-bit.  Second, is that the latest mod_mono now requires glib, where it
did not before (My working copy of mod_mono was woefully out of date but I
was happy). 

Anyway, after much trials and tribulations, I've been able to build &amp;
install the latest mod_mono and use the packaged 2.4.2.2 mono .dmg's (for
easy upgrades) using these steps:

1) Ensure you have the standard mono os x binaries installed (I am currently
using 2.4.2.2)
1) Install MacPorts
2) Edit /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf and add (or change) this line
to:

universal_archs i386 x86_64

Note: If you already have macports installed without this, you'll have to
re-install all related ports.

3) Edit /opt/local/etc/macports/variants.conf and add:

+universal

2) Install glib2 and libtool in MacPorts:

sudo port install glib2 libtool

4) download (latest) mod_mono source or check out from svn
5) modify src/mod_mono.c and comment out this line (if it exists) as it
borks on leopard:

// sigaddset (&amp;sigset, SIGPWR);

6) Then time to build &amp; install mod_mono:

PKG_CONFIG_PATH=&quot;/opt/local/lib/pkgconfig&quot; CFLAGS=&quot;-m64&quot; ./configure
--prefix=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current
make
sudo make install

7) add these lines to your /etc/apache2/httpd.conf:

Include /etc/apache2/mod_mono.conf
MonoServerPath
/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/bin/mod-mono-server2

c'est voila!
