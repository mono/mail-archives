</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've bene considering providing a way to keep bundle resources

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> aid project organization.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi Michael,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> thanks for that. If you are currently thinking about this, can I put in a
</I>&gt;<i> request?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I'm sure you are aware, when files get added to the project, their
</I>&gt;<i> entries in the csproj file can look something like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;&lt;Compile Include=&quot;..\..\path\on\disk\file.cs&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;&lt;Link&gt;path\in\project\file.cs&lt;/Link&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;&lt;/Compile&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i.e. when adding files to a project, you can &quot;add as a link&quot;. In this case,
</I>&gt;<i> the actual file resides somewhere else in the file system, as defined by the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Include&quot; attribute, but the file appears to be organised within the project
</I>&gt;<i> according to the path defined in the &lt;Link&gt; element, relative to the root of
</I>&gt;<i> the project. In the case where a file is created in the same directory as
</I>&gt;<i> the csproj, the file's actual path and its project path are effectively the
</I>&gt;<i> same. It is the project path that determines how the file is organised
</I>&gt;<i> within the project in the solution pane of MonoDevelop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can I request that any build process uses these more abstract project paths
</I>&gt;<i> in determining what files to build and where to put the outputs. This would
</I>&gt;<i> mean that the organisation as seen in MonoDevelop would be the determining
</I>&gt;<i> factor in how the project is built, which makes some sense to me and
</I>&gt;<i> conforms to your initial statement of &quot;the relative path within the project
</I>&gt;<i> reflects the relative path in the app bundle&quot;. Then, the actual file paths
</I>&gt;<i> would only ever be used to retrieve the contents of the file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Consider these files in a project as an example:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> /Info.plist &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;-&gt; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Builds to
</I>&gt;<i> App.app/Contents/Info.plist
</I>&gt;<i> /Resources/Image1.png &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; -&gt; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Builds to
</I>&gt;<i> App.app/Contents/Image1.png
</I>&gt;<i> /Resources/Image2.png &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; -&gt; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Builds to
</I>&gt;<i> App.app/Contents/Image2.png
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The paths on the left are the project paths of the files i.e. these define
</I>&gt;<i> how the files are organised in the solution pane of MonoDevelop. The actual
</I>&gt;<i> locations of the files on disk could be anywhere. In this case, I think it
</I>&gt;<i> is reasonable for the MonoDevelop build process to impose your statement of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;the relative path within the project reflects the relative path in the app
</I>&gt;<i> bundle&quot;. Just to clarify, I do **not** have a requirement that would do the
</I>&gt;<i> following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> /Some/Random/Folder/Info.plist &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; -&gt; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Builds to
</I>&gt;<i> App.app/Contents/Info.plist
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i.e. the Info.plist can appear anywhere within the project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hope this makes sense and I'm not rambling too much. Maybe it is not really
</I>&gt;<i> feasible for some other reason that I'm not aware of, but hopefully it is.
</I>
I'm pretty sure this &quot;virtual project relative path&quot; is already used
for content and interface builder files. However (unlike MonoTouch) it
doesn't currently seem to be used for Info.plist - I guess this was an
oversight.

I'd also been considering adding a &quot;LogicalName&quot;, that would allow you
to override the bundle resource ID (i.e. Bundle-relative path)
regardless of the actual filename and project-relative path, like you
can set the resource ID for EmbeddedResource items.
