<PRE>When building a MonoMac project in MonoDevelop, would I be correct in saying
that, at build time, Info.plist files are handled as follows:

1. If no Info.plist file exists in the project, a default Info.plist file is
generated and added to the .app bundle
2. If an Info.plist file exists in the project and it sits alongside the
.csproj file, the contents of this file are merged with the default
Info.plist file before being added to the .app bundle
3. If an Info.plist file exists in the project but it resides in some
arbitrary location that is different from point 2, this file is ignored and
the output is the same as in point 1.

This is what appears to be the case from experience and, glancing at the
code in the MonoMacBuildExtension.Build method, it looks like that is what
the code is written to do. So, the question is, if the above is correct, can
the code be changed so that points 2 and 3 produce the same build output or
is there some underlying reason for this behaviour?

Cheers,
Steven
