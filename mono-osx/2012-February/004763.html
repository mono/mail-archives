Hi Michael,

thanks for that. If you are currently thinking about this, can I put in a
request?

As I'm sure you are aware, when files get added to the project, their
entries in the csproj file can look something like this:

    &lt;Compile Include=&quot;..\..\path\on\disk\file.cs&quot;&gt;
      &lt;Link&gt;path\in\project\file.cs&lt;/Link&gt;
    &lt;/Compile&gt;

i.e. when adding files to a project, you can &quot;add as a link&quot;. In this case,
the actual file resides somewhere else in the file system, as defined by the
&quot;Include&quot; attribute, but the file appears to be organised within the project
according to the path defined in the &lt;Link&gt; element, relative to the root of
the project. In the case where a file is created in the same directory as
the csproj, the file's actual path and its project path are effectively the
same. It is the project path that determines how the file is organised
within the project in the solution pane of MonoDevelop.

Can I request that any build process uses these more abstract project paths
in determining what files to build and where to put the outputs. This would
mean that the organisation as seen in MonoDevelop would be the determining
factor in how the project is built, which makes some sense to me and
conforms to your initial statement of &quot;the relative path within the project
reflects the relative path in the app bundle&quot;. Then, the actual file paths
would only ever be used to retrieve the contents of the file.

Consider these files in a project as an example:

/Info.plist                              -&gt;        Builds to
App.app/Contents/Info.plist                        
/Resources/Image1.png           -&gt;        Builds to
App.app/Contents/Image1.png
/Resources/Image2.png           -&gt;        Builds to
App.app/Contents/Image2.png

The paths on the left are the project paths of the files i.e. these define
how the files are organised in the solution pane of MonoDevelop. The actual
locations of the files on disk could be anywhere. In this case, I think it
is reasonable for the MonoDevelop build process to impose your statement of
&quot;the relative path within the project reflects the relative path in the app
bundle&quot;. Just to clarify, I do **not** have a requirement that would do the
following:

/Some/Random/Folder/Info.plist             -&gt;        Builds to
App.app/Contents/Info.plist                        

i.e. the Info.plist can appear anywhere within the project.

Hope this makes sense and I'm not rambling too much. Maybe it is not really
feasible for some other reason that I'm not aware of, but hopefully it is.

Cheers,
Steven
