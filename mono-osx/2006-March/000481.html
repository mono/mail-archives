<PRE>Hi Josh,

First off, the test dmg that is on the mono site has a GC bug that won't
allow you run XSP on a mactel.  It is thread related, and XSP is
multi-threaded, as you might have guessed (go figure).

<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/news/archive/2006/Feb-28.html">http://www.mono-project.com/news/archive/2006/Feb-28.html</A>
(this version does not run XSP!)

The bug is fixed in SVN, but you have to compile mono from source to get it.
Bryan @ Imeem actually found it and patched it (some of it).  See bugzilla
#77790.

XSP crashes bad with a SIGSEGV on startup.

To get to that point though, you would first have to adjust your PATH to
find the XSP you compiled (assuming you compiled it from source). I use
.bash_profile for all that stuff.  If it isn't finding XSP, then the
location of XSP isn't in your path - at least that is my guess.  Either that
your it needs a chmod +x.  But that is usually handled by your &quot;make
install&quot;.

Did you compile it from source?  Or use fink/darwinports?

When I compiled XSP from source I used the same --prefix=/usr/local I used
for my mono.  Fink puts stuff in /sw, and darwinports uses /opt/local... I
use a hybrid of darwinports and manual compile to make life easier (I use
darwinports for most of the deps, adjust my DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to include
/opt/local/lib, and compile mono on top of that from SVN, etc).  But that is
just what I do, and it works for me - not a best practice :)

Anyway, it is all academic, because unless you are prepared to compile up
mono from source right now, there isn't a way to get XSP working properly on
mactel... 

Except maybe one:

Bryan at Imeem sent out a note on this forum that he has an unofficial
package of working mono for mactel for testing I believe, you may want to
dig that up.  

Look for: [Mono-osx] Universal Binary support for mono

Cheers,
Sean

PS. And if you have never compiled up mono from scratch, and don't plan on
using the hybrid approach, set aside a few days and have good read of this:
