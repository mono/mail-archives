<PRE>Hi folks, 

Re: the call for OSX86 testing.

I posted this in bugzilla as #77810.
<A HREF="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=77810">http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=77810</A>

I spent some time trying to figure out what was causing this, and I think I
have tracked it down (to a certain level)...  I used some hack
instrumentation to dig into the Exception that was coming out of
StreamReader.ReadToEnd() when I was trying to use XSP.

Below is the output from XSP as the first page is loaded, and it tries to
parse the machine.config.

I believe it is related to the [in,out] parameter on the FileStream.Read
method for the destination buffer:

        public override int Read ([In,Out] byte[] dest, int dest_offset, int
count)
        {
            System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;Attempting a Read on: &quot; + name);
            System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;Read: target buffer length (dest): &quot; +
dest.Length);


This section of the output is what shows where the memory corruption occurs,
and what follows is exceptions (and SIGSEVs):
        
StreamReader: created new buffer: 4096
Attempting a Read on: /usr/local/etc/mono/1.0/machine.config
Read: target buffer length (dest): 6488165

The following (hacked up) code snippet shows the caller StreamReader loop
for chunking the file.  It gets about 3/4 into the file, reading it properly
(I can dump out the text StringBuffer and see the XML). For each chunk I had
it create a new dest buffer... The original code re-uses the same buffer, so
I tried this to see if it changed the outcome - and it didn't... With the
new buffer in hand it then attempts to pass it into the FileStream.Read():

            while (len &gt; 0 || len == -1)
            {      
                buffer = new char [size];
                System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;StreamReader: created new buffer:
&quot; + buffer.Length);
                
                len = Read (buffer, 0, size);
                System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;StreamReader.ReadToEnd: len after
Read : &quot; + len);   

                if(len &gt; 0)
                {
                    text.Append (buffer, 0, len);
                    System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;StreamReader.ReadToEnd: text :
&quot; + text.ToString().Length);
                }
            }


what the output shows is that the destination buffer, when it is created, is
4096 as expected, but just after it has been passed into Read() it is some
obviously bogus length: 6488165.

This is likely something down in the core mem handling that is way beyond
me.  I assume it is related to the [in, out] param, as the buffer looks fine
just before the call.

Is anyone aware of this and working on it?  Anything more I can do?

Hope this helps - I really need mono to run on my MacBook :)
