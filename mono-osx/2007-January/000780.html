<PRE>First, let me apologize in advance if this is an RTFM issue and I  
just missed it, but I've not had any like so for. My situation is  
this, I'm trying to use the Dumbarton framework. When I use the pre- 
compiled version I downloaded from the imeem website, I get a bunch  
of architecture errors. I'm running an Intel MacBook and it seems  
that particular framework was compiled only for the PPC architecture.  
So, my next attempt was to compile the source. This proved friutless.  
For reasons totally beyond my comprehension, the libjudy.a dependency  
would not compile. Then I realized the source was somewhat out of  
date. So, I next got the latest code from SVN. Judy compiled fine.  
However when the Dumbarton framework tries to compile, XCode fails  
telling me the it can't find the Mono framework. Now, I have triple  
checked that the Mono framework is accessible from /System/Library/ 
Frameworks, /Library/Frameworks, and /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/ 
System/Library/Frameworks. This last path seems to be necessary for  
getting Judy to compile. I have no idea why. If you couldn't tell,  
I'm fairly new to Macintosh development. I'm also get fairly  
frustrated, as I want to start porting .NET apps to Tiger. has anyone  
run into a similiar situation? The documentation on compiling  
Dumbarton is somewhat minimal, so any help would be greatly  
appreciated. Thanks.
