As I mentioned in my last email (sorry again for the delay), the  
current solution is to use DBMonoClassRepresentation for this, though  
I'm not opposed to adding the sort of convenience methods you want to  
DBMonoObjectRepresentation. The patch looks fine except that it lacks  
field access and I would prefer the word &quot;Class&quot; where you have used  
&quot;Static&quot;, to stay consistent with nomenclature used elsewhere in  
Dumbarton.

If you could make those changes, I'd be happy to check in your patch.

Also, please don't assume that the examples are standard in any  
way... they're fairly incomplete as they are right now and mostly  
just give people an idea of what they're in for... :)
