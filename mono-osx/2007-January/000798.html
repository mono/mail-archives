The GC change is in SVN, but it hasn't been merged into the release

I suspect that this process causes a lot of temporary objects of  
varying sizes to be allocated. The current GC doesn't behave the best  
while allocating large chunks of memory, especially when this pattern  
is atypical for your application. It causes a lot of new pages to be  
allocated for objects of various sizes that will be unlikely to be  
used again in the lifetime of your application.

[...]

This is the relevant part of configure.in:

	*-*-darwin*)
		platform_win32=no
		CPPFLAGS=&quot;$CPPFLAGS -no-cpp-precomp -D_THREAD_SAFE - 
DGC_MACOSX_THREADS -DPLATFORM_MACOSX -DUSE_MMAP -DUSE_MUNMAP&quot;

If you compare the release tarball to the one in SVN, you can see  
that the release doesn't turn these flags on.

</I>
Yes. Yes it is. I'm not sure why the change hasn't made it into  
release tree. You'll have to ask somebody like Miguel or Wade about  
this.
