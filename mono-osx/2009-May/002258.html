<PRE> &gt;Fwiw here are some places where I think mobj/mcocoa are better than  
Monobj:

I would tend to agree with Jesse on a number of these points. I see I  
wasn't the only one puzzled by the Monobjc naming convention. From  
what I've seen in native bridges, the convention seems to be to  
substitute an underscore for the colon in the Cocoa method name.  
Eugeny strictly observes this even down to the trailing colon.

In a few places in Monobjc the constructor saves you from a lot of  
typing. So for example the NSWindow constructor can be used, avoiding  
the need for InitWithContentRectStyleMaskBackingDeferScreen, which is  
longer even than antidisestablishmentarianism, the longest word in  
English (<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidisestablishmentarianism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidisestablishmentarianism</A>).

I looked briefly at mcocoa but since I need 10.4 support it wasn't  
really an option. Also, it looked like it wasn't complete. For  
example, I couldn't find BeginModalSessionForWindow, which I needed.  
Maybe it's been added, or maybe it was there all along and I just  
missed it, but in any case I moved on. However, I'm willing to take  
another look at some point a bit longer term, perhaps when 10.6 is out.

Thanks.
