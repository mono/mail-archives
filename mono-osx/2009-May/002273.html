<PRE>Yes, I would like to work on an alternate System.Drawing assembly with  
you.  However, be warned that although I am a highly experienced and  
talented programmer, my exposure to OS X API's has been slight since I  
have not been paid to work on Macintoshes in some time.  But I am  
eager to learn, willing to obtain study aids at my own expense, and  
willing to be flexible.

But how do we begin?  How to start a project and get it recognized by  
the Mono Project?  How do we manage source control?  Should I use  
Xcode or Monodevelop (preview or stable release)?  Yes, I am a detail- 
oriented worrier.

As a matter of general philosophy, I an less offended by build-time  
dependencies on freely-available libraries than a run-time dependent  
on the X11 server.  The former is a smaller inconvenience for  
developers than the latter is for end users.  But a library that  
references System.Drawing could create circular dependencies in this  
project.  I am always looking for shortcuts, especially if I am one of  
two people tackling a task this big.  In the short run at least, I  
believe we may need to be prepared to reference, adapt, or copy  
anything that license restrictions permit.

One thing we need to settle quickly is what API we build on.  I have  
some ideas but few conclusions.  The bridges I mentioned promise to  
clear one hurdle for us.  But they are thin wrappers around the native  
frameworks and are not intended to handle some of the translations you  
mention.  A new release of Monobjc that eliminates dependency on  
System.Drawing and has some other powerful features was just  
announced.  But I find the claims of NObjective particularly  
exciting:  Its build uses a translator that extracts info from  
Objective C Introspection to build bridges (including bidirectional  
exception re-throwing) for all frameworks in a list.  If  
System.Drawing is already using Carbon and NObjective lives up to its  
hype, we could build a bridge for Carbon and adapt some of the  
existing work.  However, I know even less about Carbon than Cocoa and  
Apple seems to be deprecating Carbon.  I am willing to go along with  
the opinion of someone who has more knowledge in this area.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Lee,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting post.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe that Mono's System.Windows.Forms implementation on Mac  
</I>&gt;<i> does use System.Drawing fo do everything. One big problem with that  
</I>&gt;<i> is that System.Drawing is dependent on libgdiplus.0.0.0.dylib, a  
</I>&gt;<i> native library included with Mono. This library is dependent on the  
</I>&gt;<i> following native libraries, which are either included with Mono or  
</I>&gt;<i> come from an X11 installation (a showstopper in my opinion). Here's

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> System.Drawing encompasses everything from colors to fonts to  
</I>&gt;<i> images. Currently Monobjc relies on System.Drawing to do a few  
</I>&gt;<i> implicit conversions, for example between System.Drawing.Color and  
</I>&gt;<i> NSColor. These kinds of conversions are handy but of course tie your  
</I>&gt;<i> app to X11.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> NObjective and mcocoa don't appear to have dependencies on  
</I>&gt;<i> System.Drawing, but then they don't appear to have ways of doing  
</I>&gt;<i> these conversions either. Also, I believe Laurent is working on  
</I>&gt;<i> removing the System.Drawing dependency and providing some other way  
</I>&gt;<i> of doing the conversions. You might check with Laurent on the  
</I>&gt;<i> Monobjc user list to see where he is with that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having a dependency on System.Drawing in Monobjc also presents a  
</I>&gt;<i> problem for me. I started working on a proof-of-concept Monobjc- 
</I>&gt;<i> based WinForms implementation. I'll need to supply some parts of the  
</I>&gt;<i> System.Drawing namespace too but I can't do this as long as another  
</I>&gt;<i> assembly (Monobjc.Cocoa.dll in this case) references the Mono  
</I>&gt;<i> System.Drawing assembly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would you be interested in working on an alternate System.Drawing  
</I>&gt;<i> assembly with me? Initially I would only need some of the basics  
</I>&gt;<i> like Font and Color, but obviously the more there is to it the better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I don't know what the Mono team's plans are for WinForms on  
</I>&gt;<i> Mac. I think it's pretty hideous and unusable in its current Carbon  
</I>&gt;<i> and X11 based form, although if you've looked at the latest  
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop preview you can see that they've been able to put the  
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop menus on the Mac menu bar (although they're using Carbon  
</I>&gt;<i> functions to do it, not Cocoa), so it is possible to clean up a  
</I>&gt;<i> WinForms app a bit. Note that this does not reduce the dependence on  
</I>&gt;<i> libgdiplus.0.0.0.dylib or X11 any.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks.
