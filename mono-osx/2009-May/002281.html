Yes, neither one is a good option, but I think it is a lot better for  
the wrapper classes to preserve the real method names in so far as  
possible instead of trying to torture them into fitting the .NET  
guidelines.
&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> is the code also autogenerated in mcocoa?
</I>
There's a little bit of hand-written code in mcocoa for stuff  
like .NET-style enumeration support in the collections or BeginInvoke  
in NSApplication, but pretty much all of it is autogenerated.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me that these APIs need to be thought out in terms of what

</I>&gt;<i> the Framework Design Guidelines.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, after reading the docs for it seems like this should be

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	public ValueChangedEventArgs : EventArgs {

</I>&gt;<i> 		public object ChangedObject { get; }
</I>&gt;<i> 		public Hashtable Changes { get; }
</I>&gt;<i> 	}
</I>&gt;<i> 	delegate void Change (object sender, ValueChangedEventArgs vc)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So code that consumes this would then do:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	class.Changed += delegate (s, args){
</I>&gt;<i> 		Console.WriteLine (&quot;Change at {0}&quot;, args.KeyPath);
</I>&gt;<i> 	}
</I>
That's a difficult question. There's clearly value in providing a  
limited number of alternatives like enumeration via IEnumerable in  
addition to the normal cocoa mechanisms, but flat-out hiding cocoa  
functionality behind a .NET style wrapper seems wrong to me. It's a  
lot simpler if the managed code is simply a bridge into cocoa so you  
can continue to use apple's documentation and examples without  
worrying about how they map onto your semi-cocoa wrapper.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This also allows for a nice separation between methods which wrap
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cocoa and those added by the bridge (which can use the standard .NET
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> naming conventions). In addition it allows mobj to automatically
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> register methods with the objective-c runtime so you don't have to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> litter your code with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [ObjectiveCMessage 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (&quot;observeValueForKeyPath:ofObject:change:context:&quot;)]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like you have to do in Monobj.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I appreciate this direction: exposing the full API, and then providing
</I>&gt;<i> wrappers, but I am not sure that it is a good idea to expose the
</I>&gt;<i> low-level API.
</I>
Maybe I wasn't clear. I was making two points there:

1) Using names_like_this allows them to be automatically registered  
with the objective-c runtime so you don't need to force this with an  
attribute as you do in Monobj.

2) If the Cocoa wrapper methods are_named_like_this and methods added  
by the managed framework are named BeginInvoke then it is crystal  
clear which is which and where people need to look for documentation.
