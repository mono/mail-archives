</I>&gt;<i>

agreed on Monobjc as the best choice for the base, here.

&gt;<i> MONODEVELOP
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    In addition to the templates for the bindings (which each binding
</I>&gt;<i> could provide;   We would just have to make it so that MonoDevelop can
</I>&gt;<i> locate those templates installed by other frameworks).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    But additionally, if we add support for Interface Builder, we  
</I>&gt;<i> should
</I>&gt;<i> probably be thinking how can we map interface builder outlets and map
</I>&gt;<i> those to code-behind or partial classes to give folks automatically
</I>&gt;<i> support for intellisense for any outlets/objects created.
</I>
we have some stuff in Oxygene/Delphi Prism (currently VS-bound) that  
we'd be happy to contribute. we've got tools that generate partial  
classes based on outlets and actions defined in NIB files in the  
project, as well as an msbuild task to &quot;macpack&quot; WinForms, Cocoa# and  
Monobjc projects sop you can build an .app right from the IDE. some  
work/thought would be eneded to get this moved over into MD, but  
should be doable and provide a good starting point.

as i'm extremely swamped with stuff the foreseeable future, i don't  
wanna get too involved in actually DOING this myself, but if anyone  
wants to take a look at our stuff and take over the task of migrating/ 
incorporating that, they can contact me and we can get going.

check out these links for descriptions of whats there, currently:

fwiw, i'll also be at WWDC, if anyone wants to meet up and (whether  
for this, or just in general ;)


yours,
