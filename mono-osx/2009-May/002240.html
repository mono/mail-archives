<PRE>Hello folks,

    We are at an interesting point in the life of Mono on OSX.

    I want to discuss two topics

BINDINGS

    We at Novell are still shipping the old Cocoa# that is no longer
being actively developed or maintained and in the meantime three
bindings have been created.

    I took a look at MonObjc this weekend and the docs were great, the
source code pretty and the community seems active.

    I know there are two other bindings (one from Jesse I believe, and
one that uses some static bindings that is supposed to be very fast).

    We do not plan on spending any resources (Novell) on Cocoa# at this
point, but we will continue to ship the library for folks that might
have taken a dependency on it and expect it to be part of Mono.

    But we would like to encourage/recommend one of the new frameworks
for Mono, and we would love to see MonoDevelop templates so folks doing
OSX-only apps can get up and running in no time.

    Is there any reason why we can not merge the &quot;best of&quot; each
framework into MonObjc which seems to have an active and vibrant
community?

MONODEVELOP

    In addition to the templates for the bindings (which each binding
could provide;   We would just have to make it so that MonoDevelop can
locate those templates installed by other frameworks).

    But additionally, if we add support for Interface Builder, we should
probably be thinking how can we map interface builder outlets and map
those to code-behind or partial classes to give folks automatically
support for intellisense for any outlets/objects created.

    The Silverlight and ASP.NET setups depend on this to improve
intellisense.

Thoughts?

Miguel.

</PRE>
