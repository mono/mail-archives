<PRE>Hi. I had previously submitted my app to mac app store creating the package
with MonoDevelop 2.8.  Application Loader accepted it without a problem. The
app was rejected for something minor which I fixed. But now I have to create
the package using MD 3.0.2 and this time when I try to upload the Release
Package created by MD, Application Loader gives me the following error:

 

&quot;The application is invalid. The executable((null)) is missing a required
architecture. At least one of the following architecture(s) must be present:
i386, x86_64&quot;

 

I noticed that when I build the game in debug mode, the .app file in the
bin/debug folder can be double clicked on and the app runs fine. But when I
build the release version, the .app file in bin/release has a big void sign
on it and when I try to run it it says:

 

&quot;You can't open the application (my app's name) because it may be damaged or
incomplete.&quot;

 

Maybe that has something to do with it? Can anyone help me? Thanks.
