<PRE>Hi All,

I have a customer that is having troubles with his mono installation. He has
a Mac Pro which, at some point, has had Mono 2.4.2.3 installed and he is
trying to upgrade to the latest 2.10.5.

I instructed him to run the uninstall script that deletes the
/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework and all the symlinks and then install
version 2.10.5.

After he has done this, on typing &quot;mono -V&quot; at the command line he gets the
output:

$ mono -V
dyld: Library not loaded:
/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/2.4.2.3/lib/libgthread-2.0.0.dylib
Referenced from: /usr/bin/mono
Reason: image not found
Trace/BPT trap

Given that he has run the uninstall script, I was confused as to how this
could happen. After much email dialog with him, I got him to type &quot;ls -l
/usr/bin/mono&quot; at the command line and got the output:

-rwxr-xr-x   1   root   admin    7727744    8 Oct 2009    /usr/bin/mono

i.e. /usr/bin/mono is not a symlink - I guess it is a binary from the old
2.4.2.3 installation. What this means is that the uninstall script does not
delete this file and when the new version is installed, it does not
overwrite this file with the appropriate symlink.

So, the obvious thought is to ask him to delete this file and then reinstall
2.10.5. But before I ask him to do this I wondered if anybody has seen this
sort of thing before and do you have any insight into what might have caused
it? Also, I currently have no knowledge of whether /usr/bin/mono is the only
problematic file or if all the other Mono installed symlinks are also files.
What would be the easiest way to determine that this is the case?

Thanks,
Steven
