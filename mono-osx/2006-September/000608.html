<PRE>I have just downloaded your Xcode plugin for C#/Mono, something I  
have been looking for for some time, with great anticipation. I was a  
bit disappointed to discover that it did not work properly on my G4  
iMac running MacOS 10.4.7, Xcode 2.4 and Mono 1.1.17-3.

I read through your PDF and noted your disclaimer that the code had  
only been tested on Intel based systems. Provided are the steps I  
followed and some details I observed. I am willing to send you any  
specific files you wish or to assist in any other matter to aid to  
resolving this -- just let m know.

1. I installed the files in exactly the manner you indicated, and the  
options showed up the project type dialog as expected.

2. I create a new C# application project named &quot;FromXcode&quot; just to  
see what would happen.

3. The first thing that I noticed, was that in the main Xcode window  
(see Picture1 attached) there was an unnamed 'Product' file. This  
does not agree with your document where the name of this other file  
should be (in my case) &quot;FromXcode.exe&quot;.

4. Ignoring this I attempted to compile the project and received the  
following message (see Picture2):

5. I then attempted to add the C# Library target to the project  
(named it &quot;XcodeLib&quot;) and noticed that the &quot;Architecture&quot; was not  
&quot;mono&quot; as your documentation indicated, but &quot;ppc&quot;; I changed this in  
both targets and now the original target seemed to compile (no errors  
were reported) -- but the &quot;Run&quot; option does not become enabled! Nor  
is there any indication that the library (which has no sources) was  
compiled or created. The list of source files contains only the  
original CS file and the unnamed target.

6. Subsequent attempts to build report that dependencies are being  
checked, a Clean does not change this -- the source file is not  
actually compiled again. Even stopping and starting Xcode and  
removing the build folder from the project does not change this. If I  
look into the build folder, there is no EXE file generated (possibly  
because the target file is incorrect).

7. I went back and re-read your documentation and realized I had made  
an error. On page 10 you indicate that one should right-click on the  
sources icon (in the left of the main Xcode window, I presume) and  
select the &quot;Add&quot; and &quot;New File...&quot; option -- but when I do so, there  
is no &quot;C Sharp&quot; option as your documentation indicates!

8. Finally, as a second check, I started over from scratch, deleting  
the entire project folder, but this time I changed the architecture  
from &quot;ppc&quot; to &quot;mono&quot; before I attempted to build the application for  
the first time. The build did not indicate that any source file was  
compiled -- just that dependencies were being checked and that all  
was well. Againt, nothing to run.
