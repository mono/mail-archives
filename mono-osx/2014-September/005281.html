<PRE>Hi,

I&#8217;m trying to create a Mac app that uses existing C# code. The app mounts FUSE filesystems in the host OS and mediates file reads/writes with various network services.

I&#8217;m using Xamarin Studio and Xamarin.Mac, in an attempt to get the Windows version of this app running on OS X without having to write a native OS X version. There are two problems I&#8217;m currently struggling with:

Mounts not appearing in the Finder:
Using the HelloFS example, it appears that the mounts made by Mono.Fuse do not appear 100% of the time. Most of the time they don&#8217;t. One time it did initially appear, but then disappeared. Another time it appeared only after I restarted/force quit the Finder. Is there some step I need to perform to get the Finder to reliably show those mounts?

Getting Mono.Fuse to build in Xamarin Studio:
Since there is no pre-made package for Mono.Fuse, I am trying to make it in Xamarin Studio. Since I&#8217;m new to C#/Mono/Xamarin, I&#8217;m not sure how to go about it. I&#8217;ve created projects for Mono.Fuse.dll and libMonoFuseHelper.dylib, but get an error in Xamarin Studio that &quot;You need to have pkg-config installed&#8221;. I have installed it via macports, but don&#8217;t know where to tell it that.

Any advice?
