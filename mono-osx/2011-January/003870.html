</I>&gt;<i> You need to add the added files to the addin's&lt;Runtime&gt;  element so
</I>&gt;<i> that they get included in the addin when packed for the online
</I>&gt;<i> repository.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> did not see those but have added them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the .xft.xml files, LanguageName should be C#.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I forgot to ask what that should be in my post.  Have now changed it 
</I>&gt;<i> to c#
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, they both have
</I>&gt;<i> a DependsOn for a nonexistent xib file,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I thought I had taken those DependsOn out already.  Anyway got them 
</I>&gt;<i> out for sure now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and since they don't have
</I>&gt;<i> designer classes, don't need to be partial.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the way I was using them they had to be partial.  Probably short 
</I>&gt;<i> sighted on my part (see below about the Register)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe I don't understand the purpose of the &quot;Inherited NSView&quot;, but I
</I>&gt;<i> assume they are meant to be able to be created either programmatically
</I>&gt;<i> or as a child widget in a nib (rather than the owner/root widget).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From programmatic use, it would be useful to have a parameterless
</I>&gt;<i> ctor, and for using in nibs it would be good to add a Register
</I>&gt;<i> attribute to make the objective-C name of the class explicit (since
</I>&gt;<i> there is no designer class doing this).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Added the constructor that takes no parameters.  I assumed that it 
</I>&gt;<i> would inherit the NSView constructor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I thought about the Register as well but the way I am using it there 
</I>&gt;<i> was no need to add the Register.  Here is the only way I have been 
</I>&gt;<i> using these.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Within my nib I create a subclass of a NSView with the name of the 
</I>&gt;<i> class I am going to use for example MyCustomView.  Then on the Custom 
</I>&gt;<i> NSView that I add to the ContentView I change the Type to MyCustomView 
</I>&gt;<i> within IB.  When I save this it is automatically sent back to the 
</I>&gt;<i> designer class via the MonoDevelop Bridge with IB.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     // Should subclass MonoMac.AppKit.NSView
</I>&gt;<i>     [MonoMac.Foundation.Register(&quot;MyCustomView&quot;)]
</I>&gt;<i>     public partial class MyCustomView {
</I>&gt;<i>     }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This automatically is registered and is marked as partial.  Thus you 
</I>&gt;<i> can not decorate with Register nor mark the class as non partial.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I said probably a little short sighted.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This may not be found useful but would have definitely loved the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Inherited NSView while going through the Core Animation Book samples.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> They are very simple and was just trying to get my feet wet with the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> add-in code.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> What it does is add two new File types to the add-in.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Inherited NSView    -    Creates a class that inherits from NSView.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Inherited NSWindow    -    Creates a class that inherits from NSWindow.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> These do not create NIB files associated like what is delivered but are
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> used to override what is defined in a NIB file when creating a custom
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> view or custom window.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I definitely find the Inherited NSView handy and a time saver.  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> NSWindow
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> less so as have only had need to do that twice so far.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Added the Inherited NSWindow because it was basically a copy and paste
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of the Inherited NSView.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If there are problems with what was done please let me know.
