We are, and even more complex since we have to make a bundle (basically a dylib) not a mach-o executable.

There will basically be no options for this one aside from &quot;proxy to this dll&quot; in the way I'm invisioning it, but we can likely stuff that in the Info.plist and use a generic launcher, since thats basically all it does, unless I'm missing something.

The difference we have is we have no way to do this without making a native lib, unlike monomac where we can use the scripted launcher.
