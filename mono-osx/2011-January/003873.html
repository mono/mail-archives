Thank you for the response.

 &gt; You need to add the added files to the addin's&lt;Runtime&gt;  element so
 &gt; that they get included in the addin when packed for the online
 &gt; repository.

did not see those but have added them.

 &gt; In the .xft.xml files, LanguageName should be C#.

I forgot to ask what that should be in my post.  Have now changed it to c#

 &gt;Also, they both have
 &gt; a DependsOn for a nonexistent xib file,

I thought I had taken those DependsOn out already.  Anyway got them out 
for sure now.

 &gt; and since they don't have
 &gt; designer classes, don't need to be partial.

For the way I was using them they had to be partial.  Probably short 
sighted on my part (see below about the Register)

 &gt; Maybe I don't understand the purpose of the &quot;Inherited NSView&quot;, but I
 &gt; assume they are meant to be able to be created either programmatically
 &gt; or as a child widget in a nib (rather than the owner/root widget).
 &gt; &gt; From programmatic use, it would be useful to have a parameterless
 &gt; ctor, and for using in nibs it would be good to add a Register
 &gt; attribute to make the objective-C name of the class explicit (since
 &gt; there is no designer class doing this).

Added the constructor that takes no parameters.  I assumed that it would 
inherit the NSView constructor.

I thought about the Register as well but the way I am using it there was 
no need to add the Register.  Here is the only way I have been using these.

Within my nib I create a subclass of a NSView with the name of the class 
I am going to use for example MyCustomView.  Then on the Custom NSView 
that I add to the ContentView I change the Type to MyCustomView within 
IB.  When I save this it is automatically sent back to the designer 
class via the MonoDevelop Bridge with IB.

     // Should subclass MonoMac.AppKit.NSView
     [MonoMac.Foundation.Register(&quot;MyCustomView&quot;)]
     public partial class MyCustomView {
     }

This automatically is registered and is marked as partial.  Thus you can 
not decorate with Register nor mark the class as non partial.

As I said probably a little short sighted.

 &gt;&gt; Hello all
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; This may not be found useful but would have definitely loved the
 &gt;&gt; Inherited NSView while going through the Core Animation Book samples.
 &gt;&gt; They are very simple and was just trying to get my feet wet with the
 &gt;&gt; add-in code.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; What it does is add two new File types to the add-in.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; Inherited NSView    -    Creates a class that inherits from NSView.
 &gt;&gt; Inherited NSWindow    -    Creates a class that inherits from NSWindow.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; These do not create NIB files associated like what is delivered but are
 &gt;&gt; used to override what is defined in a NIB file when creating a custom
 &gt;&gt; view or custom window.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; I definitely find the Inherited NSView handy and a time saver.  NSWindow
 &gt;&gt; less so as have only had need to do that twice so far.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; Added the Inherited NSWindow because it was basically a copy and paste
 &gt;&gt; of the Inherited NSView.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; If there are problems with what was done please let me know.
