<PRE>El 01/02/2011, a las 01:58, Miguel de Icaza escribi&#243;:
&gt;<i> The MonoMac project has a tool that does this.   A further refinement
</I>&gt;<i> is to use Mono's linker.
</I>
Is this tool the bmac.exe specified in github's repository? I can't find it anywhere on my hard disk, and there doesn't seem to be any other binary.

&gt;<i> If you want to roll this on your own, you can still use Mono's linker
</I>&gt;<i> by hand, it is documented on our web site.
</I>
Are you refering to the web page at <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Linker?">http://www.mono-project.com/Linker?</A> It seems to refer to old versions of the linker, I guess it is the one I found at /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/2.8.2/bin/monolinker.

I've tried following the instructions linked from there but they don't work any more (-p false says &quot;System.ArgumentException: The requested value 'false' was not found&quot;).

But I've tried running &quot;monolinker -a build/bbiribbabba.app/Contents/Resources/bbiribbabba.exe -c copy&quot; and replaced the Resources directory with the generated output directory. The program still runs and now the bundle is down to 7.3MB. How can I verify nothing else is required to run on another system other than a test? Is there something like the otool -L command?
