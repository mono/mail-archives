#1.  I dont have access to a mactel (when I did I published binaries  
for all)

#1.  They were
#2. I ported the GC not Bryan (altho he did take some initial stabs  
at it and was on the right track), and lupus did most of the jit  
alignment changes needed for pinvoke / sse transitions of the xmm  
registers.

#1.  I dont work for novell; bitch at them if you feel its &quot;under  
supported&quot; (see next point down).

&gt;<i> I suppose there is a FAQ somewhere about building mono on Mactels?   
</I>&gt;<i> If there

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Because its exactly the same as building on PPC now; and did novell  
ever officially announce support for OSX86?  I think not; so dont  
bitch about lack of docs / tools.  However if you had asked you would  
have been answered.

</I>&gt;<i> If/when you finally get yourself an intel Mac, you will see why I  
</I>&gt;<i> say the
</I>&gt;<i> PPC is dead :)  At least to OSX it is... And I believe this is the  
</I>&gt;<i> mono-osx
</I>&gt;<i> list, no?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
OSX 10.4.7 upcoming release is still released for PPC.  OSX 10.5 is  
still going to be released for PPC.  This is the mono-OSX list as you  
so helpfully pointed out; thus PPC for MONO is not &quot;dead&quot;.
