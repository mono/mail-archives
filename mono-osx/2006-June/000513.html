Yes, it was unfortunate that the build process was in the middle of
changing right when Bryan was working on that.  But, it wasn't so much
that I wanted to revamp the build process, as it was that I wanted to
integrate the process into the same system that is used for all of our
other platforms: linux, windows, and solaris.  This allows faster build
times for releases, easier maintenance, and a uniform system to run our
test suite on builds that end up being released to the public.

As for a universal build, I've only had a little time to look into this.
One of the things that remains to make this work complete is the
dependence of patching mono's configure.in.

I also spent a little time trying to set up a cross compiling
environment.  But, it seems that patching is also required to build the
mono deps:

checking for extra flags to get ANSI library prototypes... configure:
error: can not run test program while cross compiling

I realize that I could fudge things along to make cross compiling work,
but I'm trying to keep the processes and environments as clean as
possible.

Since we currently have an x86 mac mini in the mail, our earliest
deliverable will be an installer for mac x86.

Another option for universal installer integration is to split_and_lipo
on all the built zip/rpm files just previous to creating the installer
(IE: within macosx/new/buildpackage).
