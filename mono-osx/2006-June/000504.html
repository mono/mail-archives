To quote you: &quot;Over-architected.  Hmmph.  How about under supported...&quot;

I would take that as an intentionally provocative statement bordering  
on trolling.
To paraphrase; &quot;bitching&quot;.  If you look back to my first response I  
in fact responded to everyone stating that its not as difficult as  
you made it out to be (building mono).

Bryan is a great guy.  If you wish to know what I did for osx86  
please read svn logs.  I care not for kudos or thanks I have my own  
reasons for the hacking I do.

</I>&gt;<i> was just trying to help out Mike when I got attacked by a kangeroo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Again; read the first email I sent to you and your response to it  
before blindly throwing around accusations of me &quot;attacking&quot; you.

With that I'm done with this thread publicly and privately.
