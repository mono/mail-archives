<PRE>I don't recall ever bitching, and if so it was only in response to
yet-another-overly-touchy dev who decided to take the time to bitch me out
for no particular reason.

I think the Novell/Mono folks do a great job, and if you had something to do
with the port to osx86, many thanks.  I am very appreciative of your solid
work, and make use of it daily.  But Bryan &quot;did&quot; fix the GC threading bug
that caused XSP to crash.  I was there for that one, and was most grateful.
Bryan was also pleasant and helpful... In contrast to some.

Prior to a year ago I knew little to nothing about Gnome libs, unix library
paths and the long stack that leads to mono. And I knew less about OSX.  I
am probably one of the few people who out there who is delivering production
corp sys ASP.NET applications using a pure OSS stack built using Mono (dev'd
on OSX86 no less).  I evangelize Mono and OSS in places that are pure MS.
And that helps, because I used to be MS.

This is good for Mono, believe me.  I have no idea what you do, or who you
work for, but if you care about OSS, I am on your side man, lighten up.

Today I know a little bit more about these things... But only a little.  I
was just trying to help out Mike when I got attacked by a kangeroo.

Frankly I still prefer darwinports to the complexity of the mono build
process... But they are way back on 1.1.12...

Kangeroo I hope you at least have a sense of humor.  Thanks for the tip
about the release scripts, I will look when I get a chance.

Dude, get a Mactel, and then preach to me about the PPC.  You just sound
like a guy with processor envy.

Cheers,
Sean

PS.  For those insane folks like myself who feel the need to code .NET on
OSX, check out this Blacksun plug-in for Eclipse.  It makes C# deving on OSX
such a pleasure:

I was using Improve's for awhile, but this one is way better... The code
outline is a godsend.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>
