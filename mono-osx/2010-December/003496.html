<PRE>We are currently using Mono.framework in conjunction with IronPython to provide cross-platform scripting in our Rhino application.  We have just released a 64-bit Mac version of our application and researching how to provide scripting support in the 64-bit version of the app.

The choices seem to be:
1) build our own 64-bit version of Mono.framework.  I have already built a 64-bit version of libmono.dylib, so I understand how the individual pieces of the framework are built.  I have not found, however, a script or Xcode project that assembles the Mono.framework itself.  I'm a bit reluctant to just wing it, as there are probably parts that I would get wrong.  Also, I'm reluctant to create a full-blown 64-bit Mono.framework because there will be pieces that need to be left out and other clients on the computer would be expecting them to &quot;just work&quot;.

2) build a minimum set and include it in the application.  Recently Duane Wandless &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-osx">duane at wandless.net</A>&gt; posted directions for embedding 2.6.x Mono in an app.  Since 2.8 was the first version to support 64-bit compilation, I suspect that these directions are incomplete for 2.8.x.

3) do nothing.  This is what we do now.  We tell users to restart the app in 32-bit mode if they want scripting.  We would like to improve this situation.

At this point it would be most helpful if we could build part of the 64-bit version of the Mono.framework for internal testing and we can then decide whether to pursue choice 1 or 2 above.

I'm not asking that you provide the 64-bit version of the framework to us.  If you would point us to the script/project you use to build 32-bit Mono, we'll muck with it ourselves to get the 64-bit parts that we need for scripting.

Thanks for your help.
