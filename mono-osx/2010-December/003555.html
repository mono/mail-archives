<PRE>Miguel,

Glad the patches were satisfactory, I look forward to contributing more.

As requested, I changed the capitalization but did not drop &quot;Component&quot; in
the member names.  I will submit shortly, but wanted to resolve one other
naming issue first.

There are currently 30 ObjC methods named &quot;numberOfXxx&quot; in appkit.cs, and 1
in coreimage.cs and there does not seem to be a standard for the C# name.  I
have seen

  NumberOfXxx
  Xxx
  CountOfXxx
  XxxCount
  Count

Leaving it NumberOfXxx, doesn't seem very C#ish, and Count is only
appropriate if the object is clearly a collection.  Dropping the NumberOf is
usually confusing, for example shortening the NSColor method
numberOfComponents to just Components is mis-leading because it does not
return the components (which is an array of floats).  Granted intellisense
helps, but I think a good standard name helps make the code more readable.
 So, what should it be?

My vote is Count or XxxCount, depending on the object.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did a minimal amount of method/parameter renaming to be internally
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consist (as I saw it).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I liked them.   And these are important for two reasons: they show up on
</I>&gt;<i> intellisense, and can provide valuable information to the developer while he
</I>&gt;<i> is developing, without having to look up the documentation, and because with
</I>&gt;<i> C# 4.0 users will be able to name their parameters.   So good parameter
</I>&gt;<i> names are important.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I resisted the urge to do more extensive renaming, because I wasn't sure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it was appropriate.  I would like to rename XxxxxRGBA() to XxxxxRgba() for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consistency with MonoMac.CoreImage.CIColor and System.Drawing.Color. I also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> considered dropping &quot;Component&quot; from xxxComponent. (i.e RedComponent { get;}
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would become Red {get;}. Once again this would be consistent with CIColor
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and Color,  furthermore Component seems to be a synonym for property.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Thoughts?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let us rename it.   The only case where we might have problems is with
</I>&gt;<i> MacCore, as that API is already an API that is used by thousands of
</I>&gt;<i> developers, so we can not just break their apps like that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the &quot;Component&quot; part, I am do not remember why we did it this way, but
</I>&gt;<i> I remember that it was not my first choice, I would have to investigate
</I>&gt;<i> again why I chose to keep it that way.    For now, let us keep it as-is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is my first submission, so feedback would be helpful.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lovely work.   You just missed adding the new file to the src/Makefile
