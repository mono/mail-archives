<PRE>Miguel

The reason the events were removed was because the delegates are not 
being generated correctly for ref type parameters.  This was the change 
that we discussed on the #monomac list about that.  It was better to 
remove the events until it was fixed and just override in the code for 
the [Export(&quot;datePickerCell:validateProposedDateValue:timeInterval:&quot;)]

As per the discussion yourself and Geoff decided it was a large change 
to implement ref parameters right now.  If that has changed let me know 
and I will change it in my program.

I am also thinking that the ref parameter type is the reason that the 
proposed date value is not being accepted as well when being overridden 
as per the original post.
