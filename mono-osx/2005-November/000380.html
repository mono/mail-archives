<PRE>&gt;<i> I downloaded the latest release and then attempted to test my program,
</I>&gt;<i> which uses Windows Forms, but it does not work! It starts to launch and
</I>&gt;<i> then it simply exits. This same code would compile and run under 1.1.9,

My experience is similar to yours. A Windows.Forms application that mostly
worked in a previous version of Mono now doesn't work at all with Mono
1.1.10.

&gt;<i> As I mentioned, when I double-click on DoubleElimination.app, the icon
</I>&gt;<i> appears in the dock, bounces three times and then disappears!
</I>
Check your console.log using the Console application in
/Applications/Utilities. It should give you more information. I'm willing to
bet your program is dying with an unimplemented function exception.

I filed a bug report about an unimplemented function exception for
DefineCursor, but it was closed and I was basically told not to file bug
reports for Mac OS X problems since the Mac is not a priority for the Mono WF
developers.

However, seeing that there have been several other people reporting problems
with Mono 1.1.10, I'm starting to think that it's possible Mono 1.1.10 for
the Mac was just packaged wrong. (It's happened before!)

Has *anyone* gotten a Windows Forms or Cocoa# application to work with Mono
1.1.10?
