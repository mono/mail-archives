<PRE>Firstly &quot;kangaroo&quot; thanks for the information AND thanks for the work on
cocoa#.

Now my &quot;two penneth&quot;, I think the problem may be that mono on OSX has
attracted &quot;users&quot; rather than &quot;hackers&quot; (and with the choice of C, C++ or
objC - who can blame them for turning to c#/mono!). I am also beginning to
wonder if MWF should be the cross-platform GUI of choice for mono-OSX
developers. There does seem to be a lot of activity on the GTK front lately
(native gtk libraries; GTK 2.10 projected to have a quartz driver; ...). May
be that will be the way to go? OSX only - cocoa#, cross-platform -
gtk-sharp.

Anyway - as I said, thanks for the information (I actually had not noticed
libgdiplus was not included!).

&gt;<i> Cocoa# and libgdiplus were not included in the 1.1.10 release.  If

</I>&gt;<i> I probably should have communicated this earlier and for that I
</I>&gt;<i> apologize.  This was a strategic decision made for a number of
</I>&gt;<i> reasons, that if you care enough about to actually help with and
</I>&gt;<i> submit patches; feel free to contact me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will talk more about the Cocoa# situation tho.  Some of you may or
</I>&gt;<i> may not know that 0.2 had the entire toolkit automatically
</I>&gt;<i> generated.  Some time ago I did an audit of the classes that were
</I>&gt;<i> generated and was unsatisfied with the result.  I investigated the
</I>&gt;<i> labour involved to fix the countless edge cases to make the generator
</I>&gt;<i> maintainable and decided to go in another direction.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cocoa# 0.9 (probably what I will version it; not 100% sure yet) is on
</I>&gt;<i> my harddrive and almost ready to go on SVN.  The runtime has been
</I>&gt;<i> reworked to require no glue whatsoever, but there is also no more
</I>&gt;<i> generator.  All of the classes that will be commited by me will have
</I>&gt;<i> been hand bound under a new set of rules (trust me; it wont be hard
</I>&gt;<i> to bind new methods/classes and submit me patches).  The delay
</I>&gt;<i> getting this into SVN is a timing problem on my side; as with the new
</I>&gt;<i> Cocoa# there will be a rule that no patch will go in adding/modifying/
</I>&gt;<i> removing methods without a corresponding documentation update.  This
</I>&gt;<i> will ensure that we have up to date documentation of all class methods.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This may come at the expense of some immediate functionality; but if
</I>&gt;<i> you are using Cocoa# or want to see it succeed the 5 minutes it takes
</I>&gt;<i> to bind the class you need should not be a problem; and contributing
</I>&gt;<i> documentation goes to the future of us all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the MWF side; yes; it no longer works in 1.1.10.  This was at my
</I>&gt;<i> behest.  I am the sole contributor and maintainer of the driver and
</I>&gt;<i> have yet to recieve a patch.  I asked the MWF maintainers that if
</I>&gt;<i> they add features to the driver to make them throw
</I>&gt;<i> NotImplementedException's so that they wouldn't get lost.  As a
</I>&gt;<i> result, and some internal time pressures on me, MWF-OSX has bitrotted
</I>&gt;<i> slightly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The summation of all this is fairly simple.  If these features are
</I>&gt;<i> incredibly important to you personally/professionally/etc get
</I>&gt;<i> involved.  I welcome anyone who is willing to help.  To be frank
</I>&gt;<i> seeing nothing but complaints with no action taken by anyone on this
</I>&gt;<i> list is daunting at times and I tend to let the mails build up.  This
</I>&gt;<i> is definately not the ideal action on my side, but this isn't my full
</I>&gt;<i> time job.
