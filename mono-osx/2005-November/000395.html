Yes it did, and I've started digging thru it.  I have started to form  
some opinions; but I wont comment until I've had more time to go thru  
it.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>

I was never saying they aren't options.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>

I never meant any of my comments to &quot;bash/trash&quot; any other toolkits.   
All of my comments were in reference directly to their usability on a  
Mac, not their usability in general.  If anyone construed any of my  
comments as such; consider this my clarification.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, Gtk/Cairo runs very smoothly and is very fast.   Mono's Winforms

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we are only starting to scratch the surface on what can be

</I>&gt;<i> extrapolating that difference.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The cairo-quartz surface driver is specifically what I was referring  
to; not cairo/gtk+ tweaking in general.  XRender gives some wonderful  
gains on the xlib backend that the quartz surface does not.  Every  
time you want to paint to a quartz surface; cairo renders everything  
with pixman into a cairo-image first; then blits that image onto the  
quartz surface.  This is definately not ideal.  If you start getting  
large surfaces (say &gt;800x600) performance starts to just fall apart  
completely.  The mozilla guys (vlad and I have discussed this as  
well) have noticed this as well.  This isn't to say it wont get fixed/ 
changed; its just the current state of the union.
