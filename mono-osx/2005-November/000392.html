<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Second, I'll believe anything on Gtk+-osx when I start seeing the
</I>&gt;<i> source; 
</I>
The source got checked into CVS two days ago.

&gt;<i> but even then its not a native look and feel so to me this isn't a
</I>&gt;<i> solution.  
</I>
There is nothing stopping the community to implement a theme engine for
it or using something like the appearance manager to get the widgets to
render like OSX widgets.

With Apple's new-look-every-quarter-for-each-new-app philosophy most
people wont mind as long as the theme is reasonably good. 

So Gtk# and Windows.Forms are options for some folks.

But if you want a native OSX application, or you want to get the best
experience possible on each platform and can afford the time and
resources Cocoa# plays a key role.

Am very supportive of Cocoa# but lets not trash the other toolkits in
the process, I think each one has its pros and cons.

&gt;<i> As for Gtk 2.10 having a quartz driver; its backed by cairo and I've
</I>&gt;<i> worked on the current cairo-quartz surface; and I can tell you it
</I>&gt;<i> needs some love before using it for Gtk+ on OSX as a full windowing
</I>&gt;<i> system (MWF-OSX uses it today and its less than ideal).  
</I>
Well, Gtk/Cairo runs very smoothly and is very fast.   Mono's Winforms
code has not been tuned like Gtk has and is noticeably slower.  

I think we are only starting to scratch the surface on what can be done
to improve the rendering performance.  We know there is a gap because of
the Gtk vs Winforms speed differences (both using Cairo).  I am happy
extrapolating that difference.

Miguel

</PRE>
