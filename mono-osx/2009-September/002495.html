Hi Kenny,

I'm currently evaluating this exact combination for use as well.

I'm also noticing some issues on Snow Leopard...

</I>
I'm not sure this really is fixed, or else there are other bugs in the  
same low-level code.  I've been able to build mono (see below) and can  
still force a crash by running:

	Console.WriteLine(&quot;{0}&quot;, Process.GetCurrentProcess());


&gt;<i> Issue #2:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can see that in the output at the bottom of this mail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My question here:
</I>&gt;<i> Am I the only one with these issues?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Has anyone else been able to build on snow leopard?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any ideas?
</I>

I was able to build on Snow Leopard.  I followed most of the  
instructions here:

	<A HREF="http://mono-project.com/Compiling_Mono_on_OSX">http://mono-project.com/Compiling_Mono_on_OSX</A>

to build the dependencies, then here:

	<A HREF="http://mono-project.com/Compiling_Mono_From_SVN">http://mono-project.com/Compiling_Mono_From_SVN</A>

to build from an svn checkout.

The main thing I did change was to first add a few lines to the script  
which sets up my mono dev environment (do this before building any of  
the dependencies):

CFLAGS=&quot;-arch i386 -D_XOPEN_SOURCE&quot;
LDFLAGS=&quot;-arch i386&quot;
CXXFLAGS=$CFLAGS

Things were definitely not happy when trying to build for x86_64, but  
I was more interested in getting something built that I could test  
than in debugging the build on that architecture.

So now I have a mono build that I can use to track down some of these  
various issues.  I wonder if anyone has any tips on debugging mono on  
Mac OS X?  I ended up using gdb from the command line to do a few  
simple tests, but I'll probably try to at least set things up to debug  
with Xcode.

FWIW, the I tracked the first issue mentioned (or my variant of said  
issue) down to a null pointer dereference in mono/io-layer/processes.c  
in the load_modules call.  The call to getsectbynamefromheader is  
return null, and no check is done so a later call crashes.  I haven't  
yet figured out why it returns null under Snow Leopard as I'm not too  
familiar with those APIs.  I'm also brand new to mono development so  
I'm still trying to figure out what the heck I'm doing.

I'm willing to help fix some of these 10.6 issues as long as someone  
can help point me in the right direction when I get lost.


Jason
