<PRE>
Wanted to start compiling mono from trunk, started with libgdiplus...
Checked out a working copy, no configure script but hey there's autogen.sh.

autogen.sh  -  <A HREF="http://pastebin.com/m4d0074fd">http://pastebin.com/m4d0074fd</A> <A HREF="http://pastebin.com/m4d0074fd">http://pastebin.com/m4d0074fd</A> 
note the following lines from the output :
./autogen.sh: running `libtoolize --copy --force'
./autogen.sh: line 177: libtoolize: command not found
 
$ make - this fails on the first line  - 

[mono] ~/Public/OpenSource/MonoTrunk/libgdiplus @ make
make  all-recursive
Making all in src
