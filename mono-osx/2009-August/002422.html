<PRE>This is neither a specific Mono nor OSX question, but more of a general 
question - but as there are lots of clever types here I guess someone 
might know.

I was writing a piece of generic code to dynamically copy a menu 
structure and reate a button based view (don't ask, management request) 
and that wa all pretty simple. I got everything working well. However, I 
got to the part when I was attempting to hook up the events and realised 
I have no idea if it is even possible to do this!! I was using VB.NET 
(legacy code), but have been banging my head on the table all morning. 
Does anyone know how you can replicate the following:

buttonX.Click += SomeOtherComponent.Click;

This does not compile!! I looked and looked and most articles assume you 
will have the method attached to the event, except this is a big bolt on 
to legacy code that I'm not going to be able to change without a lot of 
tedious regression testing, especially as I'm actually hoping that the 
management will change their minds. So I solved the issue with a 
complete hack (aka &quot;Shim&quot; class) that takes the Component (i.e., above 
Control) and looks for the protected &quot;OnClick&quot; method using reflection 
and provides an implementation that essentially wraps the Invoke() for 
that method. Yes, very WinForms specific, but I assume the same would be 
true of the following code:

    class SomeTestClass
    {
      public delegate void TestDelegate();
      public event TestDelegate TestEvent = null;

      public SomeTestClass()
      {
      }

      private void SecretTestEventInvoke()
      {
        if (TestEvent != null)
        {
          TestEvent();
        }
      }
    }

    class ConvolutedExample
    {
      void TestMethod1()
      {
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Some code for option 1&quot;);
      }

      void TestMethod2()
      {
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Some code for option 2&quot;);
      }

      SomeTestClass test1 = null;

      //Ignore the fact I could store boolean - this is not the issue, 
the issue is
      //&quot;getting the event&quot; when we do not know which method it is 
attached to.
      //This example is purposefully convoluted to make is simple to 
read the logic.
      public void Main(bool useOptionOne)
      {
        test1 = new SomeTestClass();

        //so, we don't have a direct way of knowing which one was 
set.... (we are ignoring the bool, this we assume is
        //happenening in IDE/thirdparty generated code and we do not 
have access or ability to change.)
        if (useOptionOne)
          test1.TestEvent += TestMethod1;
        else
          test1.TestEvent += TestMethod2;
      }

      //yes - this is not really a &quot;good&quot; idea, it is just an 
illustration. 
      public SomeTestClass InitTest2()
      {
        //here we want to use the same method... except we can't get &quot;at it&quot;
        SomeTestClass test2 = new SomeTestClass();

        //here is the issue:
        test2.TestEvent += test1.TestEvent; //&lt;----- does not compile!!! 
How does one get a reference to the Delegate this contains???

        return test2;
      }
    }

My answer is a complete hack and I'm really unhappy with it. If the 
&quot;OnClick&quot; method didn't exist, it wouldn't have worked also. I'm hoping 
I'm just being really dense today, because this should be possible!

Any ideas? TIA,

M
