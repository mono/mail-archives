<PRE>The ability of a window and text box to display their default appearance
is not dependent on any application code-behind.

Actually, the sample program includes a NIB file and an App Delegate  
class.
But the nib is not compatible with OS X 10.5.  I tried it under OS X  
10.5.8
and got the same results as Alex until I cut out the nib.  The  
attachment
is a nib-less version of the program that will launch and display a  
window
under OS X 10.5.8.  One must also modify Info.plist to change the
LSMinimumSystemVersion and remove the reference to the nib.
However, the window initially appears blank white and the app
will not quit unless I use Force Quit.  But the Close, Minimize, and
Zoom buttons do work, and after some manipulation the window refreshed
and displayed a more normal appearance.

Perhaps it would be better to include the XIB file in the sample.   
Please
save it in a XIB format version compatible with Interface Builder 3.1.4.
