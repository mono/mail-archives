Sorry, I guess &quot;native&quot; is a poor description of what I was asking.  I was
not expecting theming or menu placement.

I did assume though that if System.Drawing was rewritten to use CoreGraphics
that this would imply replacing Carbon with Cocoa.  My understanding was
that Windows.Forms used System.Drawing and so if System.Drawing (or even
just GDI+) was ported that Windows.Forms would just inherit that.  What else
needs to be done?  I guess I need to look at the code.

As for theming, is this just expanding the EnableVisualStyles stuff that you
already did for Windows.  As for the menus, I assume that something similar
could be done for Windows Forms as what was done for GTK# on the Mac.
