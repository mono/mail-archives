<PRE>
I have an intermittent problem. I have a mono application as a .app bundle on
my desktop.

Occasionally, double-clicking the .app has no effect. You see the icon
effect (the icon increases in size and fades out), but the application never
launches.

Looking in the Console, the line

      Unknown command line option '-psn_0_548998'

appears for my application. This is what is seen on the command line if one
types &quot;mono -psn_0_548998 appname&quot;. Typing &quot;mono appname -psn_0_548998&quot; has
no issues since the command line option gets passed through to my
application.

It appears that the launchd app of the OS is adding this extra option and
passing it through to mono. Although, given that the problem is
intermittent, it does not do this every time. When the application works,
one can see, from doing a &quot;ps agux&quot;, that my application does not have a
&quot;-psn...&quot; option on its command line whereas other running applications,
such as iTunes, do have the option.

After googling around for this, there is very little information. The -psn
option is for the OS X process id, but that's about as much as I can find.

Has anybody else seen such an intermittent problem? I am running OS X 10.6.4
and Mono 2.6.4

Steven
