<PRE>
Proxies and OS X is a topic on which I recently did a whole lot of
investigation. OS X's built-in proxy client is an application-level proxy.
It works with apps like Safari, but does not work with commands or utilities
like curl or rsync. Some commands or utilities will work when the http_proxy
or ftp_proxy env variable is set, but others will not work. (curl works with
these variables, likely because it has built in support for virtually every
proxy protocol.) Most GUI apps likely will not work with these env vars. If
you want one solution that works with both applications and commands/tools
you'd need a circuit-level proxy client. There's only a handful of those
available on OS X. Proxifier is the best of the lot in my opinion.

There are a few things that need to be known in order to help you find a
solution. Which proxy protocol is the server running? Is it http, socks4,
socks4a or socks5? Does the server require user authentication?

I assume you are talking about trying to get the MonoMac plugin from within
MonoDevelop. Does MonoDevelop execute a shell command to download the plugin
or does it dowload the plugin all by itself?
