<PRE>
I have a MonoMac project that depends on some libraries that are not part of
the MonoMac project and not standard to OS/X.  When I build a Mac Installer
the libraries are not included... I would like to manually include them. 
How is that done?

The details of this project are a bit complex, so if the question above
cannot be answered here's some more info:

This is a project I inherited and it includes
- third party libraries
- C libraries (as part of the project but not in MonoDevelop)
- .Net UI
- command line executable written in C (not .Net)

I can compile and run the project fine on OS/X.  I can build an application
bundle (which doesn't include the libraries or command line executable)
which runs on the development machine.  The application bundle does not,
obviously, run on any other machine because it doesn't include the
libraries.
