Thank you guys so much for helping me figure this out!!!

The project I'm working on is structured like this:

I have the main executable (a C# / .Net program) compiled to let's call it
&quot;main.exe&quot; from my source code.  My source code also generates a dll that
main.exe depends on, let's call it &quot;mylib.dll&quot;.  mylib.dll is also a C# /
.Net program and has lots of calls to Gui classes in the .Net framework,
including Win Forms.

I created an empty MonoMac project (no source files) and copied main.exe
into &quot;bin/Release/main.exe&quot;.  At this point I can create a bundle or
installer, but neither works because mylib.dll is missing.

Then I right click the project and go to &quot;Add File&quot;, select mylib.dll, check
&quot;Override default build action&quot; and select &quot;Content&quot; for the build action
and add the file.  Now, when I create a bundle it works (includes the
mylib.dll in the bundle and the program runs).  But when I create an
installer... it doesn't include the mylib.dll in the bundle inside the
installer!

The thing is, I'm using MonoDevelop just so I can use MonoMac to easily
bundle Mono with my app... but in fact, I'm compiling my app from the
command line using autoconf, automake, and other Unix tools.  So I have the
application running from the command line.  I am currently looking into
creating the bundle myself, by hand, and just including all the Mono runtime
libraries.

I'm just looking for the easiest way to create an installer so my users can
have an easy experience.  And it seems MonoMac is really close to being
extremely useful here.  I'm not attached to using MonoMac, so please
recommend whatever you think is the simplest way to get my application into
a bundle that includes the Mono runtime.

Thanks again guys!
