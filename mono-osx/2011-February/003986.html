<PRE>Hello !

Thanks for your answers  !

For the monomac dll, i already tried what you said but it seems the MonoMac.dll is not loaded... How to ensure that this dll is already loaded ? 
I'm currently on the alpha channel to monodevelop, but maybe these modifications are not part of this channel ? If it's the case I will have to recompile or way to see them in the alpha channel.

Regarding the NSApplication.Init , it's because Growl must be configure -i.e. calling Dlfcn.dlopen (path_to_growl_bin, 0); BEFORE the NSApplication.Init - see <A HREF="http://cocoa-mono.org/archives/254/growl-my-monomac-application-says/">http://cocoa-mono.org/archives/254/growl-my-monomac-application-says/</A> : &quot;we load the framework BEFORE the NSApplication.Init().  I tried multiple places with no success until I finally had to ask on the MonoMac IRC channel to find the answer for this. &quot;
This is why I'm calling it.
I'm sure I  can remove it but i think it will need to extension point from the monomac addin to be called before the NSApplication.Init()

Regards,
Frederic

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Some remarks :
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -----
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Since the monomac dll is delivered with the addin, What happens if two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> addins use two differents monomac (or the same) dll ? Are they shared ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Should it be installed in the GAC ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ideally, you should not bundle MonoMac. You should instead depend on
</I>&gt;<i> an addin that includes MonoMac.dll. When that addin is loaded, its
</I>&gt;<i> MonoMac.dll will also be loaded. Then, your addin will resolve that
</I>&gt;<i> MonoMac dll.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In MD master, MacPlatform addin references MonoMac.dll, for native
</I>&gt;<i> dialogs. Since MD master will soon become MD 2.6, I recommend you
</I>&gt;<i> target that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * There is a NSApplication.Init call also in my addin. How is it working
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the NSApplication from the Mac platform ? Is there any conflict ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In MD master, the MacPlatform addin calls NSApplication.Init at the
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate point, so it should not be necessary for you to call it
</I>&gt;<i> again.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm thinking it's linked but I was not able to use the shared NSWorkspace or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the shared NSPasteBoard, MonoDevelop seems to wait indefinitely.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This might be due to the fact that MD is built on GTK#, which uses
</I>&gt;<i> some Cocoa API internally but is not a true Cocoa app. Some things
</I>&gt;<i> work, some things don't. You'll need to investigate the hangs by
</I>&gt;<i> getting stack traces:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've mainly starting development on this platform - MonoDevelop, mono and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mac ! so i'm happy to any feedback, positive or not.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One of my question is, Is it a supported architecture ? Writting a plugin to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an existing application to provide feature to the mac platform using monomac
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, it is. Just beware that using Cocoa &amp; Carbon APIs from a GTK# app
</I>&gt;<i> is not always easy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Do you think it's useful ? Do you have any feedback on the feature, on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementation ? Or any idea for new features ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was thinking to be able to use the service menu like to send the currently
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> selected text in email or the currently selected solution item as a mail
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with attachments, use the dock icon to display number of error from the last
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> build.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For &quot;core&quot; features that would be useful to everyone, like displaying
</I>&gt;<i> the number of build errors on the Dock Icon, or adding commands to the
</I>&gt;<i> dock icon's context menu, I would recommend contributing such features
</I>&gt;<i> to the MacPlatform addin so these features can ship with MD core.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't want to ship Growl with MD though, so anything depending on
</I>&gt;<i> Growl would have to go in a separate addin, along with &quot;powertoy&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> features like send as email.
