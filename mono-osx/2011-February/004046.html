Form.OpenDialog() works as expect in 2.10.

Just so I am clear we are talking about the same thing here I am trying to
use mkbundle to create a package that has all the files a user would need to
run my application without installing mono. I had a post about this when I
was trying it with 2.6.4
(<A HREF="http://mono.1490590.n4.nabble.com/Redistributable-Mac-OSX-app-without-mono-using-mkbundle2-tp2216423p2216423.html">http://mono.1490590.n4.nabble.com/Redistributable-Mac-OSX-app-without-mono-using-mkbundle2-tp2216423p2216423.html</A>).
Are you saying that 2.6.4 never supported the mkbundle tool? Do 2.8.2 and
2.10 support the mkbundle tool?

Does the mkbundle tool not handle including all the assemblies and files
required to ship an application without mono? I am quite new to trying this
process out as most of the applications I have shipped to now have been for
Windows or Linux and the inclusion of mono is either no issue or not much of
an issue, however with Mac it becomes a barrier to people using your
application. From what you have indicated it sounds like the process of
bundling mono with an application is not as simple as just running the
mkbundle command. Is there any documentation that runs through what is
required to ship an app with mono? I have found very little on this subject.

Cheers,
David
