<PRE>Hey,

I'm sure that my understanding on maccore/monomac factoring is limited at best.
From what I thought, maccore keeps stuff which only happens to be reusable on both monomac and monotouch.
If some particular feature appears to be different enough between MacOS and iOS, there's no fundamental reason to keep it in maccore sans, perhaps, common pieces.

Based on the above Keychain API could be such a case.
It's not that it is that different, it is just on MacOS gives more functionality which may be interesting to app developers.
Some patterns do differ (i.e. single keychain on iOS, multiple keychains on MacOS).

So, in order to give the best coverage for MacOS and don't break monotouch, we could take the delta into monomac repo and keep commonality in maccore.

The API draft was written under the assumption that such is possible and natural - if you look at it closely, it has a bunch of MacOS-specific stuff, not available in iOS.

Does this make any sense?
