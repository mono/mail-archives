<PRE>Woho! Finally it works! 

Thank you so much for your help Michael!

Your URL was broken (for me atleast) but based on your reply I found a
similar solution here:
<A HREF="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/170017/Solving-Problems-of-Monitoring-Standard-Output-and">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/170017/Solving-Problems-of-Monitoring-Standard-Output-and</A>

I integrated this in my project and finally I could get the output! I also
found the cause of the problem, like I suspected earlier ffmpeg would output
data during the encoding phase with a &quot;\r&quot; return character instead of &quot;\n&quot;.
Before the encoding phase however it uses &quot;\n&quot;.

Based on this it seems that the mono implementation of the
OutputDataReceived event detection only looks for &quot;\n&quot; characters. In
Windows however, using the regular .NET framework, both type of newline
characters are valid. Maybe this should be posted as a bug and added so that
both characters works for finding new lines and raising the event?

Once again, thank you for all the help guys!
