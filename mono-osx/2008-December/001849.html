Getting GNUstep involved? This is getting more complicated now. :-)

Good point.

</I>
Too complicated.


&gt;<i> You might also want to look at the WinForms designer that Mono

It would only be a lot of work if it has to be perfect. But since I
see it only as an automated process to assist a manual port it
wouldn't matter if it misses controls.

In fact it would be a good start if it simply created NIB files
containing nothing but a default menu and windows with the same
attributes as the windows defined in Windows Forms (or WPF). I think
that should be doable via XIB files. I'll look into it!


&gt;<i> For real cross platform - well, WinForms getting more work would probably be

</I>&gt;<i> what you're trying to achieve.
</I>
MonoWinForms using Cocoa windows and controls would be nice. But I
understand Mac OS is not Novell's highest priority. It is sad that we
are not getting any support from Apple. .NET on Mac OS is going to
happen, so I figure Apple should make sure that it happens in the best
possible way.

I am personally quite unsatisfied with the fact that any Cocoa code I
write (and it's not a lot) is stuck in the Mac world. The iPhone
helped a bit, but it's still not super. Reviving Cocoa for Windows
would be one solution; REALbasic with Cocoa support is another; but I
think Mono is the best way.

(I don't know enough about GNUstep to be able to judge whether it
constitutes a possible escape route to UNIX from Cocoa.)
