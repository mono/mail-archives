</I>Coming from a Borland Delphi background, I've been exposed to a 
&quot;different way&quot; that might be utilised here?! In Delphi, we didn't tend 
to use drag and drop for component placement (which IIRC didn't come 
about till they changed the designer in Delphi 8) and I always used the 
keyboard to do finer adjustments to the GUI I design (which also works 
(with slight variation) in Visual Studio.) So two comments:

1) Can Stetic not emulate the way Delphi drops components (at least on 
Mac OS X target)? In the Delphi (1-7 at least) you select a component on 
the palette and then click the form designer to &quot;drop&quot; it. It will 
appear at a default size close to the location the mouse was pointing 
(typically with the left most corner at the point of click.)

2) Allow resizing and movement using the keyboard short-cuts?

(Anyone who is using Delphi still and wants to shout at me for not 
remembering *exactly* how it works, feel free to: I haven't touched 
Delphi in over 2 years, and even then it was only to maintain legacy code.)

This would seem to solve the missing functionality (up to a point.) I 
don't know how practical the implementation is; simply a suggestion!
