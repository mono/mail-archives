<PRE>I would be happy with such a temporary solution. If you want a button,  
you could select it from a panel of widgets, it appears somewhere on  
the form, and then with the arrows you can move it to the (more or  
less) correct position. Ctrl+arrows could resize them for instance.  
And with the properties panel you can set the name, text and with the  
event panel you can select the appropriate event for which then code  
is automatically inserted.

Because that is why I currently don't create GUIs yet in MD: its not  
so much about the ease of positioning widgets in the correct place,  
it's about all the properties and events I don't want to write  
manually. Properties because without a designer it's hard to know  
which are available, and for the events because of the automatic  
creation of the appropriate events.

I agree it will be hard to create group boxes like this for instance,  
but for simple GUIs it's ok, and are better then using console  
applications with text input.

In Visual Studio, I never create a console application anymore,  
because of the ease of creating a textbox and three buttons and a file  
dialog, which facilitate a lot the testing phase of program.
