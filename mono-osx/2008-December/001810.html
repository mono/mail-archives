Hello all,
I'm trying to port the OpenTK project <A HREF="http://www.opentk.com/">http://www.opentk.com/</A> to OS X.  I am
having some issues and I hope someone here can help.  OpenTK has two code
paths for creating a GL context, one is &quot;GLFW-like&quot; where a window with a GL
context is creating through native OS calls without using WinForms or GTK#
or anything like that.  This part I have working; it creates a window with
Carbon and constructs an AGL context.

The part I'm having problems with is WinForms integration.  OpenTK has a
WinForms control (GLControl) for rendering into; this works on Windows and
Linux and I am trying to make it work on OSX.  I don't know what's wrong;
all I get is a blank GLControl.  The code which creates the AGL context is
basically the same as what is done when constructing a window through native
calls in OpenTK.  AGL doesn't seem to report any errors when it comes to
creating the context for a WinForms control.  I feel like there's something
I'm not understanding about how mono creates WinForms controls on OS X that
is relevant, but I don't really know.

The code wrapping Carbon, AGL and related libraries is here, if anyone wants
to take a look:

If anyone has any suggestions or pointers on what to try, please let me
know.
