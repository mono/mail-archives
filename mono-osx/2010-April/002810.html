Hi Joanna,

... Or maybe the application I'm working on was never meant to be sold, on
top of which I don't have a Mac to try it on. :)

The &quot;conditional code&quot; wouldn't be in my own app, but in the WinForms
theming implementation (where it already is, actually, it just needs more
work). Sure, the result wouldn't be as good as if I handled all of the
specificities myself, but that'd be good enough.

I'm working on my app during my free time, and there is currently no
equivalent to this application on the Mac. So even if my app doesn't respect
Apple's UI guidelines or whatever, having this alien app on the Mac is, IMO,
much better than having nothing at all.
If my &quot;customers&quot; aren't happy with this, my code is open source, so they
can do it themselves.

Fair enough, no?
