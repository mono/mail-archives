An interesting 5th option would be Mono + Qt (Qyoto). However, I think the
main problems is that Qyoto or other Qt bindings are not very mature, and
also that there is no Qyoto designer.

By the way, forget about AWT, it's old and replaced by Swing. I don't know
about SWT, but it seems interesting... especially since I dislike Swing,
both from a user and developer perspective. Swing is slow (let's add &quot;IMO&quot;
just for the sake of being polite ;)), and I read that SWT is faster.

I guess the reason you couldn't find Apple SWT documentation is because it
is not a Java standards. It's not officially meant to replace Swing, as it
is not part of Java (so you have to ship extra stuff with your app). SWT is
pushed by the Eclipse team, not by Sun / Oracle.
It is also less documented and has a smaller community than Swing. On a side
note, there is also JFace which is based on SWT, and provides higher-level
controls.

So, personally, if I had to go the Java way, I'd check SWT out.
