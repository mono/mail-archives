macpack uses `which mono` which seems to me like it wouldn't work if 
/usr/bin/mono weren't present.

&gt;<i> You can find a more robust launch script and more explanations here:

</I>
Seems like a lot of this would be useful to have in macpack? I see it sets 
DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH, which might fix the aforementioned 
System.DllNotFoundException: libgtk-quartz-2.0.0.dylib problem that has 
been in the last couple releases. Since I use stock macpack, I've had to 
tell users to go back to 2.4.3.

Still, it would be nice to have a deprecation notice before breaking stuff 
like this.
