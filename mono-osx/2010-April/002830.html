<PRE>I noticed that retain/release/autorelease our internal methods.  I'm not fan
of doing memory management as that takes away time from solving business
needs.  Memory management is required with obj-c.  And I believe these
should be public.

There are times when an object is passed as an argument into my C# code that
must be retained while the C# code manipulates the object (typically a UI
object)... then release that object when done.  The most common usage is the
UI is a delegate for the async C# method.  At times the UI object will go
away while the C# code is running its async task.  The retain of course
prevents sending a selector to a deallocated object.  And there are times
when the UI delegate selector is not invoked so I must be able to release
the UI object from the C# code.

I think one of the fundamental design patterns of MonoTouch and now MonoMac
is that all the code will be written in C#.  I do think this assumption is
limiting.  Giving the C# code full access to the obj-c objects allows for
truly the best of both worlds.  The advantages of the C# language can be
leveraged.. but without limiting the functionality of the various NS classes
within C#.

Again my usage is a native obj-c app for the UI with the business logic in
C#.  There are advantages to fully developing within C# MonoMac ... I just
want to push the design so that is not required.
