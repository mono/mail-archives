<PRE>Hi Andrew

&gt;<i> Windows developers who are looking to develop for the Mac painfree. I can
</I>&gt;<i> imagine any number of C++ and Pascal developers wanting to write for the Mac
</I>&gt;<i> (and Linux) but I cannot imagine them to want to learn Objective-C and
</I>&gt;<i> rewrite or switch to Qt from the VCL.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe Delphi X will be like REALbasic for C++. I am optimistic. Embarcadero
</I>&gt;<i> have done an excellent job with Delphi so far!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think a native IDE is important. I now use VirtualBox to run
</I>&gt;<i> Windows.
</I>
Hmmm. I used to think Marc Hoffman was just a Mac fanboy when he would go on about his love for the Xcode/IB IDE. Now, I find myself preferring it more than either Delphi or VS. And its that annoying thing with Apple products that I can't tell you what it is about Xcode that I prefer, apart from that old chestnut &quot;it just works&quot; :-)

&gt;<i> A Mac with Windows in a VM seems to be the standard setup for developers now
</I>&gt;<i> anyway
</I>
Yes, it's surprising how many developers I stumble across that have gone that way, even when they don't yet do Mac development.

&gt;<i> In general, and this is what I like about Xcode, it is good if the IDE and
</I>&gt;<i> framework force the developer to pay some attention to OO design.
</I>
After five years of designing MVP and OPF frameworks for .NET and having to provide designers to help people write good OO code, I really appreciate having the Xcode IDE do it all for me, so I don't have to do all that groundwork again.

BTW, did you know I have written a tutorial on Mac development, especially aimed at ex-Windows developers?
