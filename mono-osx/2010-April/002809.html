<PRE>Hi Stifu

&gt;<i> WinForms wasn't originally created to be cross platform, but with Mono, it is
</I>&gt;<i> now technically cross platform.
</I>
Although you might be able to create a Winforms UI that will run on OS X, it really isn't a cross-platform solution. It's all very well and good taking the easy way out and writing less code but, if the UI is not what your prospective customers are expecting, you aren't going to sell too many copies to recoup the cost of development. Or, maybe the problem is that you don't expect to sell too many copies of your Windows program to Mac users, which is why you can't be bothered spending the time and effort getting it right? :-)

&gt;<i> The fact it currently doesn't look too good on certain OSes is not a flaw
</I>&gt;<i> that can't be fixed. There is a theming interface in place, just begging to
</I>&gt;<i> be used. Sure, you can't get something as native as a specific Cocoa (or
</I>&gt;<i> Carbon) UI, but there is no technical restriction that prevents, for
</I>&gt;<i> example, scrollbars to look like Aqua scrollbars, rather than mere
</I>&gt;<i> rectangles.
</I>
So, how do you get a single codebase to apply the correct theme for each platform it runs on without an awful lot of conditional code?

And, how do you accommodate the different layout that Apple's HIG specifies?
