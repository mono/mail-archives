<PRE>Hi Stifu

&gt;<i> ... Or maybe the application I'm working on was never meant to be sold, on
</I>&gt;<i> top of which I don't have a Mac to try it on. :)
</I>
And there is the problem. If you are not used to using Macs, then you are unlikely to know what the big deal is about look and feel.

&gt;<i> I'm working on my app during my free time, and there is currently no
</I>&gt;<i> equivalent to this application on the Mac. So even if my app doesn't respect
</I>&gt;<i> Apple's UI guidelines or whatever, having this alien app on the Mac is, IMO,
</I>&gt;<i> much better than having nothing at all.
</I>
For you maybe but, not necessarily for others.

&gt;<i> If my &quot;customers&quot; aren't happy with this, my code is open source, so they
</I>&gt;<i> can do it themselves.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fair enough, no?
</I>
Not really. You are assuming that customers have the knowledge and wherewithall to write their own code. Most people who use apps tend not to be developers, they just want a tool to do a job.

Surely, if there is no Mac version of this app, wouldn't it make sense to write it well, capture the market before anyone else and make some money out of it?

But, since you say the app is open source, where can I see it?
