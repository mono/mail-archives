<PRE>@Joanna: it sounds like you are evangelizing that Mono is bad for
cross-platform development with GUI's, because it requires a huge amount of
effort to make 3 different GUIs for Mac vs. Linux vs. Windows?  What about
Java Swing (with Eclipse IDE, or NetBeans IDE)?  What about C++ Qt?  I want
to use whatever will be best (and easiest) for cross-platform Windows,
Linux, Mac OS X.  It sounds like you are saying that Java Swing is wayyy
ahead of Mono GTK# in terms of cross-platform application development (with
a GUI) for Mac OS X?  Therefore, you think I should switch to Java Swing
(such as with Eclipse IDE)?

@Joanna: For example, you mention tabs and scrollbars as bad in Mono GTK#,
but it looks like they are good for Java Swing?  See this link (
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Java/Conceptual/Java14Development/04-JavaUIToolkits/JavaUIToolkits.html">http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Java/Conceptual/Java14Development/04-JavaUIToolkits/JavaUIToolkits.html</A>).
 This is just a look and feel style.  If Mono doesn't have an Aqua
look
and feel (the way that Java Swing does), then that doesn't mean it's
impossible - it just means that Mono GTK# is behind Java Swing (and also C++
Qt)?

@Joanna: I've actually used Qt with Visual Studio on Windows and gcc make
files for Linux, but...  This Stack Overflow post (
<A HREF="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/420065/best-crossplatform-c-qt4-development-environment">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/420065/best-crossplatform-c-qt4-development-environment</A>)
suggests Eclipse with Qt and C++?  In any event, I bet Java Swing
(Eclipse) would be easier?

thank you for info

&gt;<i> Hi Elfen
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Expecting every single application developer to rewrite the entire GUI
</I>&gt;<i> would be a huge waste of effort.  If we have 10,000 people write
</I>&gt;<i> applications that use Mono GTK#, they should not all write two copies of
</I>&gt;<i> their GUI's.  The GUI framework (such as Java Swing, or Mono GTK#, or Qt,
</I>&gt;<i> etc) should do the 99% of it that is possible (such as the look and feel for
</I>&gt;<i> Aqua)...  Then the application developers who use the GUI API would only
</I>&gt;<i> have to do the last 1% that is application-specific (such as
</I>&gt;<i>  application-specific menu bar / application bar, application-specific app
</I>&gt;<i> bundle config).  Unless I am completely confused, I think Apple's &quot;Java
</I>&gt;<i> Development Guide for Mac OS X&quot; clearly agrees?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Java Swing does the Aqua interface look and feel for you.  This is the
</I>&gt;<i> responsibility of Mono GTK#, so that every single application developer that
</I>&gt;<i> wants to use Mono GTK# does not have to reinvent the wheel.  Right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The GTK# frameworks do not support the generation of either the correct
</I>&gt;<i> Winforms or the correct Aqua L&amp;F UIs. GTK# UIs look like what they are, GTK#
</I>&gt;<i> UIs. There are some frameworks that allow the compilation of GTK+2 programs
</I>&gt;<i> on OS X but none, that I am aware of, for Mono applications.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The truth of the matter is, if you want to design a Winforms application,
</I>&gt;<i> you have to either use the Winforms designer or design all your applications
</I>&gt;<i> in code, using the Mono Winforms UI libraries, but the resultant UI will
</I>&gt;<i> look &quot;wrong&quot; on Linux or OS X.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to design a GTK# UI for Linux, it will be based on the Carbon
</I>&gt;<i> widget libraries, which is no longer considered the &quot;norm&quot; for OS X where
</I>&gt;<i> Cocoa is the &quot;standard&quot;; and it will look &quot;wrong&quot; on both Windows and OS X.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to design a Cocoa UI, then it can only be deployed on OS X.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Whichever way you try to design a &quot;one size fits all&quot; UI, you will end up
</I>&gt;<i> with a UI that will not look &quot;right&quot; in some way on some platform. The Apple
</I>&gt;<i> HIG specifies a different layout for OK/Cancel/Apply buttons than you would
</I>&gt;<i> expect for Windows. There is no Windows equivalent to Cocoa's NSBrowser
</I>&gt;<i> control. There is no Cocoa equivalent to Microsoft's Ribbon interface. Not
</I>&gt;<i> only is the menu placement different in OS X, there are many other style
</I>&gt;<i> differences that cannot be accommodated in a single design.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Take a look at the screenshot in the link from Michael's post. You will see
</I>&gt;<i> that the tabs and scrollbars are not true Cocoa and thus the application
</I>&gt;<i> looks wrong, even though the menu is in the right place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Trying to design a single UI, in code, will result in an enormous amount of
</I>&gt;<i> conditional, platform detecting, code that will, eventually become harder
</I>&gt;<i> and harder to maintain and extend. Unlike traditional Winforms applications,
</I>&gt;<i> where much code ends up being written in the main form class, Apple have
</I>&gt;<i> opted for the clean separation of concerns by using the MVC design pattern.
</I>&gt;<i> If you wrote your .NET/Mono applications using that same MVC pattern, then
</I>&gt;<i> you would only need to rewrite the controller classes for each platform,
</I>&gt;<i> using the relevant UI designers to make laying out the forms a lot easier
</I>&gt;<i> than having to write them all in code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Certainly, there are frameworks like Qt, that can be used, but that
</I>&gt;<i> requires that the application is written in C++ and that the Qt libraries
</I>&gt;<i> are deployed to the target machine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The installation of Mono is also a requirement on all machines if you
</I>&gt;<i> intend to write an application that uses the Mono framework.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I recently ported a &quot;native&quot; Objective-C application to Delphi Prism, using
</I>&gt;<i> the Monobjc framework to talk to a Cocoa UI, designed in Interface Builder.
</I>&gt;<i> The native Mac app bundle came out at around 147KB. The Mono/Monobjc app
</I>&gt;<i> bundle came out at over 2MB, and that didn't include the requirement to
</I>&gt;<i> install Mono, which comes as a 58MB download.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, Windows users may be used to having to install the .NET frameworks but
</I>&gt;<i> Mac users expect a simple xcopy type of installation wher all they have to
</I>&gt;<i> do is to drag the application bundle from the download .dmg image to the
</I>&gt;<i> Applications folder.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are many, many differences between a Mac application and a Windows
</I>&gt;<i> application, other than simply replacing the menu.
