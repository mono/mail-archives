<PRE>&gt;<i> Do you know which older version this worked on?
</I>
Try Mono 1.1.9, if you can find it. I think that's the last version that I
was able to get any System.Windows.Forms working on the Mac, and, even then,
things were rather sketchy. I first noticed MWF apps stopped working
completely in 1.1.10. I haven't bothered to even try 1.1.11 - 1.1.13, so I'm
not sure about those, but I doubt those will work. If 1.1.9 doesn't work, try
1.1.8 or 1.1.7. I'm fairly sure System.Windows.Forms worked on one of those.

System.Windows.Forms support on Mac OS X has really taken a nosedive in
recent Mono versions. The MWF guys are only interested in Windows and Linux,
and there aren't any Mac programmers contributing to the MWF implementation
for Mac OS X. It's really kind of sad. Part of the problem is that there's
only a couple of Mac Mono developers currently, none of whom get paid to work
on Mono, and MWF isn't really where they are concentrating their efforts. If
anyone wants to help out in this area, that would be great.

Later,
Ed
