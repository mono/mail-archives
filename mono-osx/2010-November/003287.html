My machine is on the fritz.  After many, many years of Apple computers with
no problem whatsoever my 4 day old ( yes day not months or years) new Mac
just shut down.  Of course can not get to my development as did not save off
to NAS nor set up my back up yet.  Well there is three days probably shot to
hell.

Anyway the last thing I did was try to compile from head and it gave me an
error that there was no target to build for RectangleF.  This was a fresh
master and not with my changes as I was going to re-apply after all was
working.

I had quite a few changes and additions to Appkit.cs and Graphics.cs that I
was using in my new project as well as a sample to be included.

After I get all running again will try the changes out.
