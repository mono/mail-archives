<PRE>Hello,

Good news is that I can not recreate any of the problems that I was having
&gt;<i> with NSTableView.  Not in any of the samples, test cases nor in my main
</I>&gt;<i> monomac/Cocoa project that I am working on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Right, that was Geoff's fixes from Friday.   Glad to see that this
eliminated a bunch of errors (it was affecting everyone, but the errors were
slightly different).


&gt;<i> Unfortunately now some other things have started acting up.  The
</I>&gt;<i> PopupBindings sample provided from monomac master does not work anymore nor
</I>&gt;<i> the new one I posted yesterday.  I have created three different tests and
</I>&gt;<i> the only one that works is with NSMutableDictionary.  I was in the process
</I>&gt;<i> of adding a class object to my main project that used the same bindings
</I>&gt;<i> concepts of PopupBindings but with a NSTableView binding instead of binding
</I>&gt;<i> to a popup button.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I am surprised that the sample ever worked.   If you google for that
particular error, you will see that our MonoTouch/Troubleshooting page
explained what had to be done.   In this case, you do not want [Export] as
that is merely to respond to the Objective-C message, but does not
participate in the key/value system.   For that you need to use [Connect].
I have fixed the sample to use [Connect] instead.


&gt;<i> Spent the last four hours trying to find the problem in my code and have
</I>&gt;<i> hit a dead end.  Could someone please verify for me that the PopupBindings
</I>&gt;<i> project works for them as it seemed to worked before.  Either one will do.
</I>&gt;<i> Sample provided from source or the one I posted yesterday.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It works now, let me know if you run into other issues.

Miguel
