Thank you for the response.

The Types= and Events= was the second way that I used to define the
delegate.

I was wondering if we should be doing it that way or not.  I saw in the
source that some were and some were not defined that way, so asked the
question.  

This was my first attempt to understand how it all fit together and I must
say &quot;Hats off to you guys&quot; for a great piece of work.

Since I have not checked the sources out, was using source tar ball first,
what would you have me do to get it to you?  It is an easy change so a copy
and paste of the NSDrawerDelegate and NSDrawerState via e-mail would work
for me.  I have the changes already outlined in an email and ready to send.  

I probably should start checking out the sources instead of source
downloads.  Have not used Git before so was holding off until I had more
time.

Kenneth
