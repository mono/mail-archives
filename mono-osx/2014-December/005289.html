<PRE>I'm an experienced VS coder, but an Xamarin newbie.

We make electronic equipment that can be configured using a simple Visual
Studio Windows program.  It's really just a collection of pulldowns for
selecting options, then some simple handshaking via RS232 serial port with
the target hardware.

Many of our users have asked for a Mac version, so I'm looking at Mono. 
Over the past few days I have slowly constructing a new Mono app in Visual
Studio, adding one simple feature at a time, then loading and building it
with Xamarin/Mono on a Mac.  This is working perfectly well for me, entirely
adequate for what we do.

But it seems that an Xamarin project that is created this way cannot produce
a Mac installation package (either .app or .pkg).

On the Mac, I can create a new project/solution in Xamarin using a Mac app
template, then the needed options appear in the Build menu and I can create
a .pkg that works exactly as I'd like.  But I don't want to completely
recreate the application using Mac tools.  A working app is nearly half done
already using VS, and it runs perfectly well with Mono on a Mac.  All I need
is an easy way to package it for distribution to our Mac users.

How do I turn my Windows Mono solution into a Mac Mono solution that will
build a installer package?

Many thanks,
Jim
