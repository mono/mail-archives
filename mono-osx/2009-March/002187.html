I specified that i was using X11 because the behavior may be different

</I>
Yes I was using WinForms as base, but I use custom controls over them.
I was using ctrl key for example to allow a multi selection, but in mac 
it has to be done using the mac key. In order to detect the 
multiselection I use something like:

if (e.KeyCode == Keys.ControlKey)
{
     multiSelectMode = MultiSelectMode.Selective;
}

I could change the condition for e.Control

But in mac I have to check the mac key, which it's received like the alt 
key as I have seen (in KeyModifiers, not in KeyCode and Alt key it's not 
received in ModifierKeys) .

I have to use ctrl key in mac for Right-click emulation with 
Control-click, and let the user do the operations (select all, 
multiselect, copy,...) as he is used to do in mac (mac + key and not 
ctrl + key).

In this way, Do you know a easy way to do the right click emulation? (To 
don't show it manually)

Regards

   Borja
