Ok, I have made my decision.

I will definitely get Delphi Prism. (I found a bunch of podcasts at
Delphi.org and that was the one more positive aspect I was looking for.)

I'll be away in April, order a Mac Pro (dual-CPU, 8 GB, 2x1 TB) and when I
return in early May I'll buy Delphi Prism and start enjoying the new
computer and Delphi! I heard a lot about parallelism features in Prism and
this machine (2 CPUs, 4 cores in each CPU, 2 hyperthreads in each core)
should be excellent for trying this out.

I would order the new Mac Pro now but with three weeks lead time it would
arrive just before I am gone for a couple of weeks.

Seems like the perfect dev machine for Delphi Prism with VMware and Windows
Vista 64.

If Prism remains as convincing as it is now I will relentlessly advocate it
to other Mac/Windows users I know. I love Mac OS and I love .NET. I always
wanted the two to get together.

Thanks to Novell for Mono!
