<PRE>
The Mono WinForms page (<A HREF="http://mono-project.com/Windows_Forms">http://mono-project.com/Windows_Forms</A>) states that a
theming interface is planned, and will help making WinForms apps fit better
with the OS it runs on. It doesn't look like it'll be there any time soon,
though.

Concerning your &quot;alignment issue&quot;, make sure you don't have any &quot;AutoScale&quot;
properties in your forms (Visual Studio and SharpDevelop add them by
default). If you do, try removing them.
