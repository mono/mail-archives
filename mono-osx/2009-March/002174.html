&quot;The entire UI is now built in C# using the Unity built-in APIs (all the 
controls, views, widgets).&quot;

I would guess this means that the controls/views/widgets are provided by 
the Unity API.  I doubt it is based on any other widget set, they 
probably have their own custom drawing/canvas stuff.  But I've never 
used Unity, so I don't know anything about the API.

&gt;<i> And beyond Unity, if a company were to build their own unique single-source

</I>&gt;<i> way to go about it?
</I>
There have been a ton of threads on this list about this topic.  Try 
reading some old threads, and you can get an idea of some popular 
opinions (&quot;use qt&quot;, &quot;use gtk+&quot;, &quot;use winforms&quot;, &quot;write a different UI 
for each platform&quot;, etc).

Best,
Sandy
