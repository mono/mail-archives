<PRE>Ron - I agree with much of what you typed, especially regarding tools being
agnostic towards languages.  And I do not want to debate languages... though
I do believe in critical mass.  The more developers using a given language
or tool will tip the viability of that language or tool.

I guess this article needs more analysis.  The end goal is to develop .NET
applications that are more integrated with Interface Builder.  I really do
not care if I have IB/Obj-C or IB/ObjectPascal UI code as long as I can have
C# code and the IB integration.

As long as Delphi Prism is agnostic and allows me to use C# from within
their IDE all is good.  But if Delphi Prism is not agnostic then we are back
to the question, how is the non-agnostic tool relevant?  This is essentially
the question I have not seen answered, and also one I have not tried to
answer for myself by trying Prism.  It is unclear from the Prism material if
C# can be side-by-side coded from within the Prism IDE.  I'm guessing not
unless you have VS Pro, though that is still unclear.

Time permitting I will try Delphi Prism one of these days.

</I>&gt;<i> Visual
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Studio, mobjc, and Interface Builder.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I see no point in any development tool that doesn't respect the

</I>&gt;<i> finally removed from MonoDevelop and IB integration plug-ins designed for

</I>&gt;<i> choice, just like I can on Windows.  This would also provide opportunities

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks everyone for the ongoing discussions and opinions... I try to keep
