<PRE>I'm experimenting with obfuscation in MonoMac. We have a lot of existing
business logic that we are reusing and would like it to be obfuscated (with
the acknowledgement that a keen developer will still be able to deobfuscate
and read the code)

It seems like once I've compiled my project (into a .app), I can crack the
package open and apply some obfuscation to the assemblies / exe inside
without any problems.

But presumably this is an issue, if my .app is signed?

Is anyone obfuscating their MonoMac application? Does anyone have
suggestions for how I can integrate this into our build?

1) I could obfuscate my assemblies in advance, then link the binaries to my
MonoMac project and build that. Of course this is a pain, and it means any
logic in my MonoMac .exe will not be obfuscated
2) Perhaps there is a way to 'delay' sign and package the Mac .app? So I
could build as normal, obfuscate, then do that packaging and signing step?
Does anyone have an insight into this?
3) Perhaps there is a way to integrate obfuscation into the build process
directly? In Visual Studio, I could presumably create an MSBuild task and
obfuscate my .NET code before the MonoMac signing / packaging step.

If anyone had some insight that could help, I would be very grateful! Thank
you in advance.
