<PRE>Hello Robert,

As you know, a Mono CLI application runs on Mac OS X out of the box.  
Open a terminal, type 'mono &lt;application name&gt;' and you're done.

A Mono GUI application isn't that easy, at present. The application  
needs a nib file, the archived user interface. Or it can use Windows  
Forms and run on X, and be ugly, no Mac OS look and feel at all.

I guess you'd like to have a Windows Forms implementation similar to  
the Swing or SWT implementations on Mac OS X, which create the UI  
without the need of a nib file. In Java, some additional work is  
needed either, to adapt it to the Mac OS idiosyncrasies. I don't know  
if work is being done in this direction for Windows Forms, though.

You can avoid using Objective-C entirely by using Cocoa#, which gives  
you access to Cocoa as C# classes. With Cocoa# you need to wrap your  
common application core (in MVC pattern parlance, the model classes)  
to interact with the nib file. There's a short tutorial on Cocoa#  
here: <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/cocoa-sharp-dev/wiki/SimpleTutorial.">http://code.google.com/p/cocoa-sharp-dev/wiki/SimpleTutorial.</A>

As I see it, you can't avoid, at present and for the next future,  
using nib files, which obliges you to do some Mac OS specific  
development. You decide the way: Cocoa# for pure C#, or either  
Dumbarton or ObjC# for mixed Objective-C and C#.

Cheers,
jaume

</I>&gt;<i> I have a small application running on Windows-OS X-Linux via Mono

</I>&gt;<i> multiple OS&#8217;s from one application. Unfortunately the OS X version  
</I>&gt;<i> is pretty rough around the edges. I have followed the conversations  
</I>&gt;<i> about the state of the port and would like to say that a native  
</I>&gt;<i> Quartz implementation of Windows Forms would be a major point of  
</I>&gt;<i> attraction for us. It seems that work has been done in that  
</I>&gt;<i> direction but more bodies are needed. Being a simple business
