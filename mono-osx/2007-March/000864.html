<PRE>
If Apple step up to the plate on mono they will, I think, be pushing  
their own core technologies ( read : Cocoa) as well as mono. i think  
they may be interested in some version of the dumbarton project, if  
anything. Were mono to be the main platform for development on the  
Mac, then the OS/AppKit team would not be in a position to innovate  
for developers.. If you read Apple's spiel on it's newest operating  
system releases the marketing does not focus on just what is  
available for consumers, but what new technologies are available for  
developers - and this is standard marketing guff sold to everyone not  
just sold on specific developer mailing lists ( the latest such  
technology to be touted is Core Animations, a Cocoa framework for  
cool animations probably used in the iPhone).

It is a stretch to believe that they will create these technologies  
and immediately port them to mono ( which in any case could create a  
disconnect between the Apple mono api set and the standard api set).

The API defines the OS, to a large extent. As does the UI.

That said, this year's WWDC is about  getting windows developers onto  
the Mac. I wonder if a senior representative on this list could point  
Apple developer connection to the possibilities of  using mono,  
Cocoa#, or Dumbarton/Objective C on the Mac  . I think Apple would be  
most amenable to promoting a mono back-end, and a cocoa front-end.

However, they may not be following the possibilities of mono on the  
Mac, at all, but this is the year to push it.
