<PRE>Hello,

    The tone of this thread is quite negative.

    The reality is that the Mono *supported* features on MacOSX are
working fine, and when an ISV raises an issue with one of our supported
features we do fix those (we just did a new pass at PowerPC issues, even
if that is a dying platform as far as OSX is concered).

    As for new developments and new features, those will require some
investment, and maybe Novell is able to do some of that work at some
point.   

    But today am mostly concerned with the fact that even on Linux we do
not have a complete Windows.Forms 2.0 stack and developers have migrated
in droves to it.   

    So my current focus will be to complete Winforms 2.0 and then we can
look at doing the Mac driver support.   This has the added benefit that
as we improve Winforms, we will not be breaking the Mac driver every
week.   Also adding a new backend now would likely slow us down (which
is why we have so far ditched the idea of doing the frame buffer edition
as well: we just can not maintain all of them at this stage, due to the
rapid changes happening in the core).

Miguel.

</PRE>
