<PRE>Oh Apple knows about Mono, and there is at least one senior Apple  
person that is/has been involved with Mono at various times in the  
last 2 years.

Apple is however, 100% commited to Objective C (and with Objective C  
2 they are making dramatic improvements in the usability of the  
language).  The issue is that most developers 'don't want to learn  
another language'.  Objective C is a little strange at first, but  
most who learn it seem to like it.

But...  You aren't going to pull many Windows devs over without a  
roadmap to get from C# to Apple technologies, and C# and Mono  are  
the best bridge out there.
