<PRE>The money isn't there.  I've spent the last 18 months trying to sell  
Mono &amp; PostgreSQL (and to a lesser degree ODBC) on the Mac to anybody  
that will listen.  So far, I have one small contract that covers  
roughly 1 day per week of a single junior developer.  All of the big  
companies and contracts have gone against my bids.  Until a big  
player, (and I think that player almost *has* to be Apple) steps up,  
I don't think we'll ever get enough Mac specific resources to get  
Mono on the Mac to be a full peer to Mono on Linux.

This is *NOT* a comment on the Mono dev's, they do the right thing  
for their business at this time.  The problem is that the Mac is not  
Linux.  Mac users will not, as a rule, accept an X11 app as a Mac  
app.  Many of them will not even accept a wxWidget, QT or Java Swing  
app that has a native .app wrapper and looks like an Aqua app, but  
behaves just a little bit 'off'

Generally speaking, Mac users don't accept the 'multiple interface  
toolkit mish mash' (brushed metal, aqua, apple pro-tools  
notwithstanding) that many Linux users do.  I've met Mac users that  
won't even use Cocoa-Java apps because of UI quirks.  Because of  
this, Windows.Forms, even with a native Mac look won't be effective  
unless they are Mac in feel as well.

I know that this opinion is not shared by others on this list, but in  
my experience. Mac users  are VERY picky, and UI issues seem to be  
that one consistent 'rub'.
