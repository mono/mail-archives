<PRE>After chatting with a few helpful chaps on the irc channel I feel that I am
very close to getting this working. After a few hours of work last night
here is a write up of what I am trying. Again, any ideas would be helpful.

My Goal = A working mono environment available in /Users/Shared/ on OS X
(10.6).

The conversation I had last night is available at pastern:
<A HREF="http://pastebin.com/N5mUTNH0">http://pastebin.com/N5mUTNH0</A>

After this conversation it seems that I should indeed be able to accomplish
my goal. Here are the steps I am going through. Where am I going wrong?

Step 1: Setting up my mono environment.
-Using the directions for setting up a parallel mono environment available
at: <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Parallel_Mono_Environments">http://www.mono-project.com/Parallel_Mono_Environments</A> I created the
following bash script.

#!/bin/bash
MONO_PREFIX=/Users/Shared/OpenSim/supportfiles/mono
export
DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=$MONO_PREFIX/lib:$DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$MONO_PREFIX/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PATH=$MONO_PREFIX/bin:$PATH
export MONO_CONFIG=$MONO_PREFIX/etc/mono
PS1=&quot;[mono] \w @ &quot;

I saved this as mono-dev-env into ~. Before running mono I entered the
environment using: source ~/mono-dev-env

Step 2: Getting and moving mono
-I was trying to build from source but after the conversation on irc last
night it seems I should be able to do the following.

1. Download Mono 2.6.7 Intel Framework
(<A HREF="http://ftp.novell.com/pub/mono/archive/2.6.7/macos-10-x86/3/MonoFramework-2.6.7_3.macos10.novell.x86.dmg">http://ftp.novell.com/pub/mono/archive/2.6.7/macos-10-x86/3/MonoFramework-2.6.7_3.macos10.novell.x86.dmg</A>).
2. Right-click the package &gt; Show Package Contents. Open the contents
folder. Double-click Archive.pax.gz to unarchive the file. It opens into
~/Download. Open this folder (it is named Library)
3. Navigate to Frameworks/Mono.Framework/Versions/2.6.7. Copy the contents
to /Users/Shared/Opensim/supportfiles/mono

Step 3: Running mono from /Users/Shared
-After entering my mono-dev-env from the CLI I enter the bin directory of
OpenSim (the application I am trying to use) and start OpenSim with this:
$ /Users/Shared/OpenSim/supportfiles/mono/bin/bin OpenSim.exe

Here is the latest roadblock:

[mono] /Users/Shared/MLTI_Sim/supportfiles/diva-r13981/bin @
/Users/Shared/OpenSim/supportfiles/mono/bin/mono OpenSim.exe
The assembly mscorlib.dll was not found or could not be loaded.
It should have been installed in the
`/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/2.6.7/lib/mono/2.0/mscorlib.dll'
directory.

A quick search has led me to believe I am missing one of the mscor libs that
come with nant (as found here:
<A HREF="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Troubleshooting#The_assembly_mscorlib.dll_was_not_found_or_could_not_be_loaded">http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Troubleshooting#The_assembly_mscorlib.dll_was_not_found_or_could_not_be_loaded</A>).
However, the file exists in
/Users/Shared/OpenSim/supportfiles/mono/lib/mono/2.0/mscorlib.dll. Mono is
still looking for it in the default install location. 

Thoughts at this point?

Also, would this be easier if one of the .dylib search paths was the mono
framework instead are hard coded paths? It seems that moving a mono install
on Windows is easy cheesy. The document I found here:
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Interop_with_Native_Libraries#Mac_OS_X_Framework_and_.dylib_Search_Path">http://www.mono-project.com/Interop_with_Native_Libraries#Mac_OS_X_Framework_and_.dylib_Search_Path</A>
lead me to believe I have to set my environment variables.

ps. I have also tried with mono 2.4.3, 2.8, and 2.10 with similar results.
