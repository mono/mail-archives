<PRE>Hello everyone

Geoff and I were discussing the use of GLU on the monomac irc this 
morning and we both came to a stand still on the way forward.

These are some of the issues that came up.

#1 - Does it work in lion? (this can not be discussed because of NDA)
#2 - Does it work _accelerated_ in lion? (this can not be discussed 
because of NDA)
#3 - Is it deprecated in lion (this can not be discussed because of NDA)
#4 - Can we just update the samples to work in 10.6 and not worry about 
this?
#5 - Go ahead and include a GLU binding but mark it as [Obsolete] but 
still usable.
#6 - All the reading I have done says most of Glu can be replaced with 
OpenGL 3.x.  Apple is still on 2.1 or something like that so that makes 
it a little harder to replace some of the functionality.

I am not an OpenGL person at all and as a matter of fact this is my 
first introduction to it nor is Geoff an OpenGL-ist so we are going to 
have to rely on everyone's opinion here.

Just as an exercise I went out to good 'ole google and tried searching 
for some replacements for Glu in the GLFullScreen example.

Glu.Perspective:
I found a replacement for Perspective and that is Frustrum.  Ok that was 
fine and even tested that out with success.

Sphere drawing with gluSphere and Quadratic
The only thing I found were discussions that said use gluSphere or write 
your own.

Should it be necessary to have everyone write their own when it already 
exists and is riddled throughout sample after sample including OpenGL 
site samples?

All you OpenGL people please weight in and give your thoughts to this 
subject so that we can continue in the most direct and proficient way 
that will benefit you.

Kenneth
