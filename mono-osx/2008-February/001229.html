<PRE>Bob,


First and foremost, thanks for the feedback.

</I>&gt;<i> I have tried the new GTK Mac backend contained in the Mono framework  
</I>&gt;<i> MonoFramework-1.2.6_6.macos10.novell.universal.dmg which was  
</I>&gt;<i> recently released.  I used in on an application I wrote and am very  
</I>&gt;<i> impressed that most things work.  Nice job getting this up to  
</I>&gt;<i> speed.  This is close to being usable.  I am on a PowerBook G4  
</I>&gt;<i> running Mac OS 10.4.10.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do have a few issues.  Although I am using mono and gtk-sharp, I  
</I>&gt;<i> suspect that the problems I am having are in the GTK backend.  The  
</I>&gt;<i> 1st of these is most important to me, the others are either  
</I>&gt;<i> annoyances or can be worked around.  But #1 completely changes the  
</I>&gt;<i> behavior of my app.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. KeyPressEvents seem to be handled differently using the X11  
</I>&gt;<i> backend and the Mac backend.  Using X11 ALL keypress events are  
</I>&gt;<i> queued and handled by the main loop when it gets around to them.  So  
</I>&gt;<i> if I have a big computation going and hit two key presses, the main  
</I>&gt;<i> loop will see them when the big computation stops and the main loop  
</I>&gt;<i> runs.  But with the Mac backend key presses are not be seen by the  
</I>&gt;<i> main loop if they are pressed while a big computation is running.   
</I>&gt;<i> They just disappear.  This greatly changes the behavior of my  
</I>&gt;<i> application (making it very hard to use reliable).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. I use a Gtk.DrawingArea. It renders the window using pixmaps (in  
</I>&gt;<i> the background) and then the pixmap is drawn to the Gdk.Window (of  
</I>&gt;<i> the drawing area) using Gdk.Window.DrawDrawable.  The problem is  
</I>&gt;<i> that using the Mac GTK backend this does not cause the actual window  
</I>&gt;<i> to get re-drawn (except when the window is first created).  If I put  
</I>&gt;<i> in an explicit call to Gdk.Window.InvalidateRect after the call  
</I>&gt;<i> DrawDrawable then it gets re-drawn but this should not be necessary  
</I>&gt;<i> (and is not necessary using the X11 backend).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. The keypress events for the function keys do not get recognized.   
</I>&gt;<i> When I print them using Console.WriteLine (&quot;KPress: {0}&quot;, evnt.Key);  
</I>&gt;<i> they show as &quot;KPress: 16777232&quot; (instead of KPress: F2, etc).  I am  
</I>&gt;<i> using a PowerBook G4 and have to push the &quot;fn&quot; key while pressing  
</I>&gt;<i> the function key so this could be playing a role (but it works fine  
</I>&gt;<i> in X11 mode).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. I use fullscreen mode (Gtk.Window.Fullsceeen) and then Hide the  
</I>&gt;<i> fullscreen window when I want to go back to my normal window.  This  
</I>&gt;<i> works well except that the Mac Menu Bar is not re-drawn after the  
</I>&gt;<i> Hide call.  I should mention that I am impressed that the Fullscreen  
</I>&gt;<i> really uses the entire screen (including covering up the dock and  
</I>&gt;<i> mac menu bar).  This is the way it should be and I was afraid that  
</I>&gt;<i> it would not work this was (this is a step up from the X11 backend  
</I>&gt;<i> on Mac).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5. I use a Gtk.TreeView and the vertical scrollbar sliders are not  
</I>&gt;<i> drawn (the horizontal ones are drawn).  The vertical scrollbar seems  
</I>&gt;<i> to work fine but I have to guess where the slider is. I noticed that  
</I>&gt;<i> the gtk-demo program has this problem also.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 6. The emulated mouse buttons do not work.  For example, control  
</I>&gt;<i> click is suppose to be like a right mouse button (button 2) but  
</I>&gt;<i> instead it shows as a control and then a click.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 7. I get a bunch of &quot;CGBitmapContextGetBitsPerPixel: invalid  
</I>&gt;<i> context&quot; getting output.  Not sure if this matters.  I also noticed  
</I>&gt;<i> that the gtk-demo program included in the distribution spits these  
</I>&gt;<i> out as well.
</I>
Could you please file issues for each of these independently as bugs  
and assign them to me (<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-osx">gnorton at novell.com</A>).  The bulk of them are  
likely gtk+ bugs, but we're trying to triage for imendio and make  
native testcases for them as much as we can (and contribute back) and  
this would be very helpful for us.

Thanks!
