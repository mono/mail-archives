I've been having problems with installing Tiger and I think I've =
narrowed the problem down to libJPEG in the OSX Mono distribution.

I upgraded to Tiger but had a problem in that the system would hang =
after the logon screen. I ended up having to do a &quot;archive and install&quot; =
to get my system back. I started putting back things and as soon as I =
re-installed Mono the problems returned (no applications would launch =
and the hang after the logon screen).

This morning I launched the console before trying to install Mono again. =
The installation goes without any problems but when I try to launch any =
application this appears in the console window (same error from two =
applications):

When I uninstall Mono there is no sign of any libJPEG libraries that I =
can see - so I wonder if there is a name clash here?
