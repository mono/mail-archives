</I>&gt;<i> compile under Mono (I have not yet tried simply executing the  
</I>&gt;<i> assembly from the Windows system). I compiled the code and then ran  
</I>&gt;<i> MacPAck to create a clicable application.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First, there was a problem with a call to  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location&quot; -- this call returned an  
</I>&gt;<i> empty string, not the directory that contained the assembly, or the  
</I>&gt;<i> directory that contained the MacPack wrapper. I modified the code  
</I>&gt;<i> to replace the result with &quot;./&quot; if the resulting string length were  
</I>&gt;<i> zero. Since the code does not yet make extensive use of this  
</I>&gt;<i> string, this is not a major problem.
</I>
Elaborate on this problem please; it shouldn't return &quot;&quot;.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The main form contains a list box and three (3) buttons, and  
</I>&gt;<i> displays cleanly. The first button causes another form to be  
</I>&gt;<i> displayed, modally, and this form contains a series of labels, text  
</I>&gt;<i> boxes, a combobox, and two (2) buttons. The intent of the combobox  
</I>&gt;<i> is to permit the user to indicate the number of teams that will be  
</I>&gt;<i> entered (I volunteer as an umpire for Little league Baseball), and  
</I>&gt;<i> the code makes the proper number of pairs of labels and text boxes  
</I>&gt;<i> visible based on the number entered. The code was updated so that  
</I>&gt;<i> the user can click on the triangle for the combobox and select and  
</I>&gt;<i> entry from the list or enter the number directly. The forma load  
</I>&gt;<i> code deals with populating the combobox using a DataTable and  
</I>&gt;<i> associating that with the combobox (setting the DataSource,  
</I>&gt;<i> DisplayMember and ValueMember).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Under 1.1.6-4 this form was displayed, but the combobox was not  
</I>&gt;<i> rendered properly and a dialog was displayed indicting that some  
</I>&gt;<i> operation was not supported. With 1.1.7 the alert dialog is not  
</I>&gt;<i> displayed, but neither is the combobox displayed properly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. When first displayed, the bottom have of the text area is filled  
</I>&gt;<i> with a rainbow of colours.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is a known bug

&gt;<i> 2. Clicking on the triangle control causes vertical lines to be  
</I>&gt;<i> displayed within the text area, but nothing else seems to happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is the same bug as above
&gt;<i> 3. Then clicking outside the combobox causes the top half to be  
</I>&gt;<i> filled with a rainbow of coloured dots.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Same
&gt;<i> 4. Tabbing into and out of the combobox does not work - the cursor  
</I>&gt;<i> simply disappears.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Tab isn't bound in the driver yet

&gt;<i> 5. Clicking in the combobox cleanly displays the currently selected  
</I>&gt;<i> value, and one is able to edit the contents, but a tab-out, which  
</I>&gt;<i> should fire a method to update the display of the team controls,  
</I>&gt;<i> does not seem to be executed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
See above

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, regardless of anything else, when I simply permit the  
</I>&gt;<i> application to terminate by closing the main form, I get an alert  
</I>&gt;<i> dialog reporting &quot;The application mono has unexpectedly quit.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was hoping that the work was more mature than it appears to be.  
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone have any ideas on whether the above issues are  
</I>&gt;<i> expected? Or when they may be addressed?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Feel free to contribute then.  I'm 1 person with a full time job.
