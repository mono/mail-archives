<PRE>Hi Andrew,

I have to say that I agree with you, I don't really care if we are going to
use or not the Novell resources, but if we do so we have to be careful and
make sure that the project does not get diluted in the mono project. 

I believe that we should try and make a difference between the mono for Mac
OS X development and what we want to achieve.. It is clear that both
projects are very tight together and that if we do our work correctly they
could even merge, but this should not be neither a goal or an initial idea.
I think that we should have some kind of manifesto that states what the
project wants to achieve and how, in other word a nice text explaining or
goals clearly and that can be understand by anyone no matter their
background.

Deciding which people (from my point of view the most experienced ones from
the last attempt/team) are going to direct the team should be our priority
right now. That way we could start organizing resources and performing some
design decisions. We cannot do anything until we get the new bindings for
object v2 besides getting the team up.

Manuel (2 am at Spain.... going to bed, the dodgy tv adverts have already
started!!!!)

Now that I'm back in the office and not painting / limited access.

I/Druware owns the CocoaSharp.org domain and website.  We have, IMO, two
options.  Merge everything into the Mono Project, or keep everything under
the CocoaSharp domain (or possibly both which is probably the Best of Both
worlds, but I don't know that we have the resources).

There is good and bad to both.

With the Mono Project option, we run the risk of being 'lost in the shuffle'
as it were, with the nominally Linux centered world of Mono, many of the Mac
specific details could get left by the wayside.  The other issue is that
cocoasharp really goes beyond the scope of 'mono', so it begs the question
of if it fits.  

With the CocoaSharp.org, you get a site that is something we can control
without impact from the Mono Team, but it comes with none of theease that
using Novell's web infrastructure brings, but also gives us the power to
create whatever we want (it is running on a shared host / Windows / ASP.NET
hosting), and though it has a wiki today, the underlying code is AWFUL, so
if that's the route we want to go, I'd like to move to something a little
better :-). 

Times have changed a bunch since I put up the original Cocoa Sharp site, the
people have changed, and the Mac has become a full peer in the Mono
community, with a person on staff at Novell working on it, so for people
like me that had become pretty frustrated with the lack of progress and/or
struggles to keep Mono and the Mac on working terms are returning to the
fold.  

I'm good with either choice, and I'll look to the community to point a
direction, but we do need to consolidate the efforts in a single direction.

found the proper letters on the keyboard to produce:

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the interest of consolidating communication for the Cocoa# project, I
</I>&gt;<i> have shut down the cocoa-sharp-dev Google group. I posted a message
</I>&gt;<i> directing devs to the Mono cocoa# mailing list.
</I>&gt;<i>  Are we using the
</I>&gt;<i> Mono wiki or somewhere else? Once that is determined, I will copy over the
</I>&gt;<i> Google wiki pages and post them on the official Cocoa# wiki page and close
</I>&gt;<i> down the Google wiki I had set up. Note that much of the content on the
</I>the
&gt;<i> Google wiki was simply copied from the old cocoasharp.org wiki.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, there is the CSharpXcodeplugin. Are people still interested in
</I>&gt;<i> developing this? If so I can move it back to the Mono SVN (there is an old
</I>&gt;<i> version of the code already in there).
</I>&gt;<i>                  
</I>&gt;<i>                  
</I>&gt;<i>                  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks
