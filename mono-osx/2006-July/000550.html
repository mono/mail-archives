<PRE>I've been playing with the latest (1.1.16.1) Intel release of mono with some
trivial SWF applications and I think(!) I have the process sorted out a bit:

Firstly (and in discussions with others in the mono-winforms list) there
appears to be a &quot;small bug&quot; in the System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms
files in the GAC. Basically, the V1 versions include a config file that is
missing from the V2 directory. Therefore, use Finder to go to
/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/lib/mono/gac.

&gt;<i>From there go to the System.Drawing/1.0.5000.0__* folder and copy the
</I>System.Drawing.dll.config file. Paste this file in the 2.0.0.0__* folder.

Go to the System.Windows.Forms/1.0.5000.0__* folder and copy the
System.Windows.Forms.dll.config file to the 2.0.0.0__* folder.

I've also found that doing the same thing in the Mono.Posix folder is
required (I'm sure you get the pattern that's emerging here).

Next go to /Applications/Utilities and start the X11 app. (You can stop the
terminal window that opens if you like - leaving it going appears to do no
harm). This gets the X11 server running.

The only thing I've not yet figured out is how to stop the &quot;Gtk no found
(missing LD_LIBRARY_PATH to libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0?), using built-in
colorscheme&quot; message form appearing. (On my system, I have a
libgtk-x11-2.0.dylib in the fink library, but config files and defining
LD_LIBRARY_PATH don't seem to do it for me as yet).

Hope this helps someone

Cheers

Susan
