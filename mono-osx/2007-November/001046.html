Well, as you say, it's all opinion. I have to respectfully disagree  
with you, as someone with &quot;time in the trenches&quot; ;-). For instance,  
when I started out doing UNIX programming, it was the novices who  
used tracing, because they couldn't understand what programs like gdb  
were telling them.

I think what we can take away from this is that perspectives differ,  
and the tools that people find useful differ too. In the end, it will  
be demand that determines which tools get built first.

I couldn't help but find it amusing that there now exists a  
development tool that can make emacs seem lightweight. :-)

Cheers,
Stephen.
