<PRE>Hi there,

I've just signed into this list because we are planning a Mac port of our
game made on .NET Framework. We have found Mono as a promising alternative
to speed the port, avoiding a complete port of the C# code for C++ and then
to another framework/engine. We really want to make such a port.

I never developed anything for Mac, but I was learning a few things about
Mono (using the Windows version). So, if you don't mind, I'd like to ask a
few questions about Mono and Mac:

1. I found some information about the &quot;macpack&quot; application. Does it work
like mkbundle for Linux, I mean, does it generates an executable file that
runs without the Mono Framework, so I can distribute it stand-alone? Or does
it just works like a Finder-friendly application, but still requires Mono?

2. What would be the average footprint on the executable file size after the
&quot;macpack&quot; run?

3. Provided an application has ran smoothly on Mono Windows version (using
OpenGL), do you know if there are any serious known incompatibilities or
inconsistencies when running on Mac version?

4. Testing on Mono Linux version would be more reliable than the Windows
version when it comes to port applications to Mac?


I'd like to thank you in advance for this information, and also ask: where
could I find some Mac players willing to Beta-test the Mac version, if Mono
can really help us on this port?
