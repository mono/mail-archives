<PRE>In this discussion, nothing has been said that would be violation of an 
NDA.  Tiger exists, some developer's have it, and there are public 
builds.  These are things that are not protected by any NDA.

What version of Apache is part of Tiger, and details along those lines 
would be NDA violations, and I haven't seen anything in this 
conversation along those lines.  Believe it or not, the majority of us 
on this list know our way around the world under NDA's, I swear I've 
spent most of my 20 year development career under some form of NDA for 
various projects.  It's just part of life.

The things that someone under an NDA can discuss are, details without 
elaboration of published features and products and the existance of 
published projects so long as the discussion sticks to that of 
published information, eg. can be found on Apple.com.

The things you cannot discuss are details of unpublished information, 
and that includes things like the version of the included open source 
project, as that information has not been disclosed publicly by Apple.

Discussing how to implement a 3rd party product on an unreleased 
project does not infringe upon the NDA, and in this case only the 
original poster acknowledges possession of Tiger (without acknowledging 
a revision #).  The rest of the discussion has been theoretical AFAIK, 
as no Tiger specific implementation details have been discussed.

I know that my instructions weren't, as they where tested on my Panther 
PowerBook :-), that is awaiting Friday  delivery of my Family Pack.
