<PRE>Hi all.

Very excited to have XSP 1.0.6 under mono 1.1.6 (all seems to be working 
great).

One question - does anyone have a method/script for running XSP as a 
daemon?  Running in the background with the --nonstop switch doesn't 
work exactly as expected (need to press the enter key to get the prompt 
back).

I'm using Textmate as an &quot;IDE&quot; of sorts - running a command to execute 
the build.  I'd dearly love to have that command also shutdown and 
restart XSP.

TIA.  Grant
