<PRE>I have a simple server and client that use sockets with tcp protocol to 
communicate.  It works great with .net 2.0.

Under mac os x the same code results in packet loss.  The greater the 
distance between server and client, the greater the loss.  I'm pretty sure 
this is due to mono for two reasons:

1) I've tried pinging various servers using native utilities, and no packet 
loss is apparent.
2) If it were a problem with the mac's network card, I wouldn't think 
distance would be such a factor.  But when on a local network, the packet 
loss is minimal (though still occures), while over larger distances there's 
as much as 90% packet loss.

My understanding is that tcp is supposed to be guarenteed to not have packet 
loss, as any lost packets are detected and resent.  So I would think that if 
there was a problem with the network card the rate of transmission would 
just be very slow.  But packets are lost and not resent.

Has anyone else seen this?  I'm not an expert with such things, so is it 
possible that it actually is a hardware issue?
