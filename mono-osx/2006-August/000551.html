<PRE>Hi,
    This may be a stupid question.  I've recently come across the  
'boo' language.  It looks interesting and it has dragged me into  
using mono.  I know the language well enough (it is pretty similar to  
python).  However, I don't know the standard libraries very well at all.

    Where can I get a library reference that I can download?

    <A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/docs/">http://www.go-mono.com/docs/</A> has online documentation for most of  
the libraries.  I guess I could crawl it, but that doesn't seem like  
a nice solution.  (I want an offline copy.)
    Microsoft has an online class library reference, and they have a  
downloadable .NET SDK which I assume includes docs.  But I don't have  
access to a Windows box, and the SDK is only available as a windows  
installer.

    I posted on the mono-docs mailing list and was told:

&gt;<i> If you have Mono installed, you should already have the library
</I>&gt;<i> reference installed.  The documentation is within the `monodoc-core'
</I>&gt;<i> package, and the documentation viewer program -- monodoc -- is within
</I>&gt;<i> the `mono-tools' package.
</I>
   But it seems the Mac Mono installer doesn't install a 'monodoc'  
binary.  As was noted earlier this month in a thread entitled  
&quot;Getting online Help to work&quot;, there is a monodoc dir consisting of  
zip files and indexes.

   Can I use monodocs2html to get useful docs?  If I try something  
like this:

monodocs2html --source /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/ 
1.1.15/lib/monodoc/sources/ --dest monodocs

I get an error that there is no index.xml, which is right.  There is  
no index.xml in the &quot;Mono.zip&quot; file in the sources dir either.  What  
should I be doing?

Thanks,

Will          :-}

</PRE>
