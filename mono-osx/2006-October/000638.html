<PRE>Hi Mark,

&gt;<i>I've also been playing with Susan's wonderful Xcode plug-in. Ken
</I>&gt;<i>didn't seem to have much luck with it on his G4 iMac, but I've only
</I>&gt;<i>run in to a few problems on my 12&quot; PB (1GHz G4, 10.4.8, Mono 1.1.18,
</I>&gt;<i>Xcode 2.4).
</I>

Firstly thank you for the kind remarks. It's nice to know that someone else
is using the plugin.

I've been in contact with en privately and we resoled the issues that he was
having. Ken added a response to one of my messages indicating the resolution
he found. He was using a ppc-based system but Mono 1.1.17.

&gt;<i>1. Compiling the default Hello-World! app results in the following
</I>&gt;<i>Error:
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;[Session started at 2006-10-15 16:51:51 +0100.]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Unhandled Exception: System.TypeInitializationException: An exception
</I>&gt;<i>was thrown by the type initializer for System.Console ---&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an
</I>&gt;<i>instance of an object
</I>&gt;<i>   at System.TermInfoDriver.Init () [0x00000]
</I>&gt;<i>   at System.ConsoleDriver.Init () [0x00000]
</I>&gt;<i>   at System.Console..cctor () [0x00000] --- End of inner exception
</I>&gt;<i>stack trace ---
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   at &lt;0x00000&gt; &lt;unknown method&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   at InstallTest.InstallTest.Main () [0x00000]
</I>&gt;<i>   at InstallTest.InstallTest.Main () [0x00000]
</I>&gt;<i>[39;49m
</I>&gt;<i>InstallTest has exited with status 1.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>By setting the .NET version flag to V1 in the Build tab of the Target
</I>&gt;<i>Info inspector window I got the expected output:
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;[Session started at 2006-10-15 16:54:05 +0100.]
</I>&gt;<i>Goodbye, Forever!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>InstallTest has exited with status 0.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What is interesting though is that if you run the V2 compiled program
</I>&gt;<i>from Terminal (or WidgetTerm) it works perfectly. After some poking
</I>&gt;<i>around in the project file, plug-in code and various templates I
</I>&gt;<i>can't see what's going wrong. Could it be a bug in GMCS/Mono on PPC
</I>&gt;<i>or in Xcode on PPC with regards to Xcode's Pseudo Terminal?
</I>

I've only just downloaded Mono 1.1.18 and I have not tried installing it yet
(too many other things just at the moment - perhaps in the weekend!!!) so
I'll see if I get the same errors. It may well be something in the way I
build the command line.

Can anyone else try this combination (Mono 1.1.18 on a PPC-based system)
with my plugin?


&gt;<i>2. Adding C Sharp/Executable targets doesn't really work. Adding an
</I>&gt;<i>executable generates the target &amp; it appears OK, but the associated
</I>&gt;<i>Executable is not configured to run /usr/bin/Mono. Also, changing the
</I>&gt;<i>build setting to Release and pressing Build does not actually build
</I>&gt;<i>anything. Haven't checked into this to see what's really going on, so
</I>&gt;<i>it could very well be something I'm doing wrong.
</I>
On Page 23 of my (probably very overly verbose) documentation, I make a
comment about a limitation of the plugin when it comes to *ADDING* an
executable target - as you found out it doesn't work without creating a
custom executable, or hacking your 'user profile' file within the project
file. 

If you want this to work, create an executable project and add the library
targets to this.

If you can find a way around this, I would love to hear about it.

&gt;<i>Finally, if you would like me too I'll make the time to make the
</I>&gt;<i>CocoaSharpApplication a proper project template and then someone can
</I>&gt;<i>add it to the files distributed with the plug-in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It's late here and I must admit I'm not sure of your meaning - perhaps you
could explain the reference to the CocoaSharpApplication with respect to the
plugin?

&gt;<i>Frankly I'm really impressed with the work Susan has put into this
</I>&gt;<i>plug-in as it does seem to work reasonably well most of the time.
</I>&gt;<i>When I get my new Macbook Pro (sometime in the next week) I'll try
</I>&gt;<i>comparing Intel/PPC in the (probably vain) hope that it might
</I>&gt;<i>illuminate some of the odd behaviour on PPC. I spent most of the
</I>&gt;<i>summer working in Objective-C and Cocoa, though I would not claim to
</I>&gt;<i>be any kind of expert, so I should be able to track down at least
</I>&gt;<i>some of the bugs. Of course my doing this shouldn't stop the more
</I>&gt;<i>experienced programmers out there from having a go.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Thanks Susan!
</I>
My pleasure.

Susan
