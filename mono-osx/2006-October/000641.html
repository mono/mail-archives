<PRE>Sorry I didn't get back to you when you sent me this question  
yesterday, but, ironically, I was at the Mono developer's meeting in  
Boston and there was no internet access:)

Here is how we do it at imeem:

We build our own universal version of Mono because there are a couple  
problems right now with the current release builds of Mono for OS X.  
Hopefully, after talking to Wade and Miguel this week (and some  
followup work), we'll fix the current problems with linking against  
the official builds as well as seeing what can be done about getting  
official universal install packages. For now, if you're just testing,  
you could probably just use one of the older platform-specific  
release builds that links properly.

We include the Dumbarton framework project file in our main Xcode  
project file, done by &quot;add-&gt;existing files...&quot; in the context menu  
for the main project in &quot;Groups &amp; Files&quot;. It's important that you  
either set your default build products folder in Xcode or manually  
set the the build products folder in your project, the Dumbarton  
project, and the Judy project inside Dumbarton all to the same folder.

In our release builds, we copy the Dumbarton framework and portions  
of Mono into the application bundle. In order to fix the sorts of  
linking problems you're experiencing, we use install_name_tool to  
change the install names referenced by the application executable and  
all of the dynamic librariesto @executable_path relative install  
names. So instead of what you're trying to do, we link to the Mono  
libraries in /Library/Frameworks/Mono/ and the included Dumbarton  
framework project at build time, copy them into the application  
bundle, and then rewrite the install names of the copied libraries.  
The install_name_tool manpage explains how to use the tool in detail.

At runtime, you'll have to tell Dumbarton where to look for your  
embedded version of Mono, otherwise the runtime will not look in your  
application bundle for the GAC. This is the code that we use:

NSString *libraryPath = [[[NSBundle mainBundle] bundlePath]  
stringByAppendingPathComponent:@&quot;Contents/Libraries&quot;];
NSString *monoRootPath = [libraryPath  
stringByAppendingPathComponent:@&quot;Mono&quot;];
[DBMonoEnvironment setAssemblyRoot:[monoRootPath  
stringByAppendingPathComponent:@&quot;lib&quot;]];
[DBMonoEnvironment setConfigDir:[monoRootPath  
stringByAppendingPathComponent:@&quot;etc&quot;]];

We don't do anything with weak linking.

I hope this helps. I just returned from Boston a few hours ago and  
I'm very tired, so I may have missed something. I've been meaning to  
write some tools to make this process easier and include samples with  
the Dumbarton example code, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The developer documentation from apple suggests that you should build

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So for now I link against the mono 1.1.17.1  version ( which is intel
</I>&gt;<i> only on my machine) without building it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the final build phase is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) copy dumbarton.framework and mono.framework to the application
</I>&gt;<i> bundle/contents/frameworks/ directory via a script
</I>&gt;<i> 2) add -weak-link dumbarton and -weak-link mono to the linker flags
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Change the mono specific  linker flags ( which i dont really
</I>&gt;<i> understand) to point to the bundled frameworks
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i.e. -L&quot;$TARGET_BUILD_DIR/$FULL_PRODUCT_NAME/Contents/Frameworks/
</I>&gt;<i> Mono.framework/Versions/Current/lib/pkgconfig/../../lib&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> -L&quot;&quot;$TARGET_BUILD_DIR/$FULL_PRODUCT_NAME/Contents/Frameworks/
</I>&gt;<i> Mono.framework/Versions/Current/lib&quot; -lmono -lm -lgmodule-2.0 -
</I>&gt;<i> lgthread-2.0 -lglib-2.0 -lintl -liconv
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So that is the main target sorted I think, but I am not exactly sure.
</I>&gt;<i> However I add Dumbarton as a bundled framework too, but do not build
</I>&gt;<i> it either.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On launching the result is :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> dyld: Library not loaded: /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/
</I>&gt;<i> 1.1.17.1/lib/libmono.0.0.0.dylib
</I>&gt;<i>    Referenced from: /Library/Frameworks/Dumbarton.framework/Versions/
</I>&gt;<i> A/Dumbarton
</I>&gt;<i>    Reason: image not found
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> clearly a reference to the mono.framework from dumbarton. This gives
</I>&gt;<i> rise to a circular problem, how do I build the dumbarton framework to
</I>&gt;<i> point to a mono.framework ( weak-linked?) within a bundle which would
</I>&gt;<i> not have been built yet, until after it the dumbarton framework is
</I>&gt;<i> linked ( I think it is clear tha I have probably have to build
</I>&gt;<i> dumbarton as part of my project.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks in advance
