</I>&gt;<i> The one minute delay is noted on this documentation page:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/mono-basics/">http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/mono-basics/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At the bottom of the section titled Winforms Hello World:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;NOTE: on Mac OS X you&#8217;ll have to wait around a minute the very first
</I>&gt;<i> time you run this command.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is in reference to running a new mono program the first time on a
</I>&gt;<i> Mac.  That's the delay.  It only happens once.  But, much like opening
</I>&gt;<i> night of a Broadway show, that's the one time when all eyes are on the
</I>&gt;<i> details.  During that one minute (a long time!) the user wonders, for
</I>&gt;<i> instance, if the hard drive is being encrypted with ransomware.  I've
</I>&gt;<i> had one user turn her Mac off after a few seconds, out of fear.

Interesting - I haven't observed anything like that before - I wonder if there's something in monomac that was removed from Xam.Mac or something?  Our mac app is developed on Xam.Mac, but then again, I don't *frequently* install on a new mac that's never had mono on it before.

I'll pay more attention and see if I notice something like that in the future...

If you have a pristine mac, you can download our app and test it on your system to see if we in fact have the same problem as you, but I've been oblivious about it.  If you discover that in fact we *don't* have the same problem as you, it might provide a clue as to what the problem is.

I don't anticipate personally running this test on our stuff for a while - if you want to test our stuff sooner for the point of comparison, here it is:
