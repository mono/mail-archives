<PRE>I just use the mono package from <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/">http://www.mono-project.com/</A> 
Downloads. Slickedit automatically detects and parses all of the Mono  
framework libraries for code completion / tag insight. You can also  
explicitly tell it where to look for libraries to parse if you've put  
them somewhere unusual.

When you set up a project in Slickedit, you can specify post build  
command line actions and 'execute' commands. I set up an ASP.NET  
project so that it builds by executing a makefile target, and then  
launches xsp as a post-build command line action. I have the  
'execute' target set up to launch the site in my default browser. In  
practice, it's kind of like using VS w/o the integrated debugging.  
The only thing that is annoying is that changes to the aspx files or  
web.config require re-running xsp. Xsp seems to cache the page  
independently of it's modification date. This can be kind of annoying  
if you are making a lot of html changes to the code that don't really  
require a recompile.

For GUI or CLI stuff you should be able to set up something similar.  
You would just use 'mono [path to exe]' to execute a CLI app, or you  
could set up  a post-build action to macpack your GUI app and just  
use 'open [path to bundle]' as your execute target.
