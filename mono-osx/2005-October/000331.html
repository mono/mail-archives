<PRE>For me SlickEdit makes a fanastic MONO IDE, i don't use debugging that often,
and the &quot;support&quot; is good at MSDN :)  for Mono.
I use WX.Wdigets WX.Net now for GUI, but when GTK+ is built for a non-X11 MACOSX
then I believe all will fall into place just nicely.
I probably couldnt build a full MS-EXCEL using wx.net or a 3D graphics package,
but give it a year. For now it builds stuff you would perhaps use Java for, just fine.
I do develop on Linux and deploy to MACOSX, so I can't speak for the build environment 
on MACOS, I'd assume its just like Linux to install it?
Be interesting to see what your heavy lifting requirements are?

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not much luck with that. It generally works, but the GUI stuff is not

</I>&gt;<i> I really have to say that Microsoft has produced three (3) things

</I>&gt;<i> XCode is great, but the Cocoa environment is missing some things that

</I>&gt;<i> to the DataSet, DataTable, etc. classes in the Cocoa/XCode  
</I>&gt;<i> environment, I would be extremely happy -- but the objective-C code  
</I>&gt;<i> is not portable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mono/.Net have excited me for some time, but I am not going to be  
</I>&gt;<i> able to use mono for heavy lifting for some time to come. I saw from  
</I>&gt;<i> another posting that we may see MonoDevelop available when the next  
</I>&gt;<i> MacOS X release is generally available, and that would be great; that  
</I>&gt;<i> and improvements to MWF should permit me to make more effective use  
</I>&gt;<i> of mono.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for the diversion: now for the problem I have been seeing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The macpack facility creates a 'package' for me that permits double-

</I>&gt;<i> every time I exit my program I get an alert that indicates that &quot;The
