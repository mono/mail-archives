<PRE>I've been periodically sending mail to the xcode-feedback group at  
Apple to try and rattle a few cages.  I also have a friend that works  
in DTS at Apple.  Through him, here is what I _know_:

* The documentation does exist.
* the interfaces are incomplete, or more accurately subject to change.
* there are a couple of 'camps' within apple, some pushing to release  
this, others resisting.

 From what little response I've gotten here is what I _think_:

The hurdles preventing the release are entirely political, and  
politics in a company like Apple can stonewall something like this  
for months or years.  I'm a one man company, and lack the clout to  
get results at this point.  Getting multiple people hounding apple is  
probably the best solution to overcoming the politics.
