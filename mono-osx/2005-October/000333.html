<PRE>Hello,

    What seems interesting from your post is that its not an
architectural problem with ASP.NET, but a limitation in Microsoft's
implementation:

&gt;<i> The way XHTML rendering is determined in Whidbey is done by using  
</I>&gt;<i> browserCaps and this in itself is ok. The problem though is that they  
</I>&gt;<i> have set it up so that ONLY browsercap entries that are known to work  
</I>&gt;<i> with XHTML output gets it, as opposed to only omitting XHTML output  
</I>&gt;<i> for browsers known NOT to work with XHTML.  Might seem like a small  
</I>&gt;<i> thing, but with new versions of browsers coming out all the time,  
</I>&gt;<i> this means we'll have to maintain the browsercaps on a regular  
</I>&gt;<i> basis.  I and a few of the others expressed a concern about this very  
</I>&gt;<i> early on in the Whidbey phase, but never got a positive response to  
</I>&gt;<i> it.  This would not have taken long to fix at all...
</I>
This is certainly something where open source can do better, we would be
willing to change this, and we could use your advise. 

&gt;<i> There's also a massive problem with the rich functionality in ASP.NET  
</I>&gt;<i> -- it only works with IE. Their javascripts are written in such a way  
</I>&gt;<i> they would only ever work on IE and as such, all other browsers get  
</I>&gt;<i> the dumbed down WebPart controls etc (no drag n' drop for instance).
</I>
Mono's implementation (specially starting with 1.1.9) will use
cross-platform JavaScript that offers this in at least Mozilla and IE,
and we will take patches for other browsers (consider our new
client-side validators that work on all browser, not only on IE).

Also, Chris Toshok has done quite a bit of JavaScript and Ajax hacking
(JUnit) and is quite excited at the possibility of bringing all the Ajax
beauty to those controls in a cross platform fashion.

This is the time to get involved in Mono/ASP.NET hacking, and move folks
from Windows to Linux ;-)

Miguel
