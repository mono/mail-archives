</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Apple can't afford to be interested right now, at least not

</I>&gt;<i> vulnerability to Microsoft.  I can't help but think  that this
</I>&gt;<i> discussion has been had at fairly high levels within Apple,  which we
</I>&gt;<i> tend to forget is smaller than it may sometimes appear.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ObjC-Cocoa is very good but unfortunately for Apple many developers 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> know and like Java and/or C# and aren't willing to learn Objective  C
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and Cocoa.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think you are correct, however, I don't think that's a huge concern 
</I>&gt;<i> for them right now, there are enough people who are willing to learn, 
</I>&gt;<i> in addition to the ability to continue to use C and C++ behind the 
</I>&gt;<i> scenes that Apple doesn't see the need.  What they are saying is that 
</I>&gt;<i> future User Interface development shall be in IB/ObjC, but you are 
</I>&gt;<i> welcomed and encouraged to use your preexisting code in it's current 
</I>&gt;<i> form from there, and that includes Java via the bridge.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I posted a reply to John Siracusa's post at Ars Technica on the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I hope somehow that Apple realise that they are badly behind other 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> platforms in this respect but I fear that the high management at 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Apple in this area are Cocoa veterans and being open to new ideas 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when you are an expert is very difficult psychologically.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's not an issue of behind, they aren't, in reality, they are  *still*
</I>&gt;<i> ahead.  the IB + Objective C approach is still far ahead of  the Forms /
</I>&gt;<i> Event designs of Windows and X-Windows.  Avalon and all  the
</I>&gt;<i> Longhorn/Vista changes in the model don't change this at all.   What
</I>&gt;<i> Apple does have is a paradigm shift that is a little tough for  switcher
</I>&gt;<i> developer to wrap their heads around.  It took me a full  year before I
</I>&gt;<i> got around to really sitting down with IB and Objective  C.  Today, my
</I>&gt;<i> frustration is that I *can't* use the same paradigm on  Windows and
</I>&gt;<i> Linux (and the person that says Gorm &amp; GnuStep gets a  slimy wet trout

Ok, this probably has been hashed out before...

Andy, do you (or anybody else) have an idea of how we can bend the right
peoples' ears in the Apple Dev tools group? Random users howling about
it on mailing lists hasn't produced what we need, but somebody in the
community probably has the connections to talk seriously with Apple's
management...

Given Apple's somewhat open stance with OSS, I'd hope we could get some
help with extending XCode. I can see them not being ready to spend the
resources to come up with a nice polished XCode SDK, but they ought to
be willing to devote a bit of time to a few registered, NDA'd external
people. &quot;Here's the class dumps and a quickie writeup on how this stuff
works under the covers&quot;.
