</I>Doesn't look like there's a lot of a chance that'll work as it just a 
load of P/Invokes to a Windows specific library. Does Wine implement the 
library? Otherwise, what, exactly, are you trying to do? Copy a file 
across a network using a specific protocol? Copy between Windows/SAMBA 
shares? I would put forward that using Sockets would be simpler. Also, 
using Remoting and file streams is possible, though security is still an 
issue (but not tied to Win32 platform specific DLL's). A Mac does not 
have a &quot;domain&quot; in the Windows sense of the word, at best it'll have 
some kind of Windows domain emulation (or workgroup) via the SMB/CIFS 
protocols implemented within it (hint, just as you can do 
<A HREF="smb://myserver,">smb://myserver,</A> <A HREF="cifs://myserver">cifs://myserver</A> works too - not sure if they use the 
same subsystem, but it works much the same in Leopard.) A &quot;lowest common 
denominator&quot;, such as a socket server, would work more successfully IMO.
