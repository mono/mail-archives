<PRE>Thanks for the suggestion. I have a .icns file that provides the icon 
for the .app bundle, but pointing the project to use this file as the 
application icon didn't make any difference. In fact, pointing it to a 
non-existent file still gave the same result, so obviously the setting 
I'm changing has nothing to do with it.

The setting I had been altering in the .csproj file was
&lt;Project ...&gt;
&lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
&lt;ApplicationIcon&gt;foobar.ico&lt;/ApplicationIcon&gt;

AIUI this is how the task bar icon is set in Windows, but it obviously 
has no effect in Mono / Mac.

I'm left with no idea how I should change the icon. There are no other 
references to .ico or .icns files in the project file. However, I am 
getting a custom icon, just not the correct custom icon, so the setting 
must exist. Has anyone else had success with this before?
