<PRE>Hi,

Sorry if this has been asked before - I couldn't find anything
relevant in the archives.

I'm pretty new to Mono in general and MonoMac in particular, so
attempting this may well be ridiculous, but: is it possible to create
Cocoa application plugins using MonoMac? In particular, I'm thinking
of a .prefPane for System Preferences. So instead of building a .app
bundle, this would need to be a &quot;loadable bundle&quot; binary, exporting a
NSPreferencePane subclass.

Generating NSPreferencePane bindings for Mono seems straightforward
enough, at least - I've done a preliminary run of parse.exe and
bmac.exe on it, and that went well enough after a few tweaks - haven't
actually tried running it yet though:

My understanding of MonoMac is that it registers the NSObject-derived
classes with the Objective-C runtime at, er, runtime. I know MonoTouch
uses AOT compilation of some sort, but it's not clear to me if this is
supported for MonoMac or if this generates static Objective-C runtime
info. So I assume that in the worst case, we would need to subclass
NSPreferencePane in Objective-C, start up a Mono environment upon
initialisation as detailed here
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Embedding_Mono">http://www.mono-project.com/Embedding_Mono</A> and let it register its
Objective-C classes with the runtime, then proxy all messages to the
preference pane object implemented in C#?

I'm worried that this is going to cause all sorts of problems down the
road, such as receiving messages on a thread created by the
application not under my control causing Mono to get confused, and the
app expecting to handle Unix process signals that Mono hijacks. I'm
thinking of NSProcessInfo's &quot;sudden termination&quot; in particular, but
there may be others. Plus there's the possibility of other plugins
using Mono - will the two domains interfere?

So basically, is this feasible or is it a Really Bad Idea/more trouble
than it's worth?

Many thanks,
phil
