I'm not sure, Joseph?

I believe the concern would be that at this very alpha stage, things are 
very, very rough.  (Hence the private preview.)  We would hate for the 
current deficiencies to reflect poorly on what actually gets released.  :)

&gt;<i> 2.  Any plans to have this work on VS2010?
</I>
That is definitely the plan.  I have tried it on the current VS2010 
beta, and it did not immediately work.  However we have quite a long 
time before VS2010 is released.

We are not spending any cycles on this currently, but my hope is it will 
work with VS2010 final when it is released.

&gt;<i> 3.  Would/could this scenario be supported:  I'm running a Linux

</I>
It is not currently supported, as we do not provide the .rpm you need on 
the Linux side.  This is because at any given release, there may be 
specific patches that are required in Mono.  Hence the Linux VM ensures 
that the correct stuff for Mono is there as well as the MonoVS stuff.

Once this is stable, we will provide the rpm, and you can install it on 
your Linux machine (virtual or real).  This will enable you to do that, 
assuming there is a network connection between the two.
