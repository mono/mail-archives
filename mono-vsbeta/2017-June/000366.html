<PRE>Hi!

Warmest regards, c.g.hamm

Subject: Hate to hear that.

Palestine isn't a state, it's a  buffer  between Israel and the Muslim world. Gaza  was a part of Egypt, the West Bank a part of Jordan. Conflict with Israel seems as though it is the only choice Palestinian leaders choose to make after their failed attempt to take over Jordan from the ruling Hashemite minority in  the 70's. It's  not complicated, they  can get more support  fighting  Jews than  they  can get fighting Muslims. If Israel was truly racist they would  have evicted every non-Jewish  person from  their territory  in  1948 and  the years following. All  the Arabs  that didn't  leave to join  the armies of  Israel's  neighbors and subsequently  invade got  their citizenship and  civil  rights, more rights than they  would have in any of the those  states that have since come  into conflict with Israel.

Relying on confirmation bias and motivated reasoning  are poor  ways to  disguise your  hatred of Israel, which is apparent to anyone reading  through your  small litany  of  anti-Israeli  statements. Have  a happy new year.
