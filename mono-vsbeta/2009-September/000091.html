<PRE>We definitely recommend using VMware for now as there are performance (and other) issues on VPC.

The mouse not functioning is really a separate issue (probably).

The nic being absent is because MonoVS requires a bridged connection and we cannot define a nic without specifying which nic it's bridged to.  Older versions of of VPC would automatically add you a nic if you didn't have one defined so it worked most of the time.  Newer versions assume you meant not to have one.  This is all irrelevant though because the modus operandi of the VPC world is to give you only a .vhd file and you have to configure the VM yourself.  I have not found any VPC images anywhere that gave you more than just the .vhd.  We are the first.

If anyone out there is familiar with fighting with Linux to get it working on VirtualPC I would love to get their help.  The few kernel parameters we have now were found on a forum or something by Joseph Hill.

I read that Microsoft has contributed some code to the Linux kernel that should make this situation better in (distant) future versions.

</I>I'm assuming the VPC image is not much use without networking enabled? When I enable an adapter, the mouse stops functioning.

I'll try the VMW version but VPC works better for me.
