The first version is pretty much what's already in the beta.  We hope to 
polish what's already there, and fix the bugs that people find before 
releasing.  However, we are definitely interested in hearing what 
features people would like for 2.0!

&gt;<i> One of the features that I think would be really useful is a ReSharper 
</I>&gt;<i> unit test runner plugin that would allow running/debugging unit tests in 
</I>&gt;<i> linux; this would make it much easier to fix issues in libraries which 
</I>&gt;<i> occur only under linux.
</I>
That's interesting.  I'll have to check out this functionality of ReSharper.

&gt;<i> The other feature that I think would be nice is to allow the use of x11 
</I>&gt;<i> forwarding with ssh (for console apps) rather than a terminal window in 
</I>&gt;<i> the VM; this would provide an development experience closer to running 
</I>&gt;<i> it on Windows because your keyboard focus would be set directly in that 
</I>&gt;<i> window.
</I>
This would be neat as well.  The dependencies needed to do this on 
Windows might be an issue.  Will add it to the feature request list!

Thanks for the suggestions!
Jonathan
