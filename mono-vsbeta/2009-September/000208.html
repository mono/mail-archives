<PRE>Since the VM is based on SLE you will not have access to those repositories unless you register it.  You could register with an eval license from here: <A HREF="http://www.novell.com/products/desktop/eval.html">http://www.novell.com/products/desktop/eval.html</A>  I'm pretty sure I put the registration packages on the VM.  Run YaST and go to Online Update Configuration (assuming it's there) and follow the instructions.  Once you have registered you should have access to the repositories.

We are planning to move the VM to openSUSE in a couple of weeks.  Then you will have easier access to repositories.  Installing gcc would probably be okay but the kernel-source package is huge and only a few people would need it.

</I>Will you guys be able to create a virtualbox vm ?

Currently I'm using the wmdk with virtualbox and it works ok, but I would like to install the Guest Additions so I can get seamless mouse, better screen resolution, speed, etc.
The cd does not seem to appear when I insert it via virtualbox. If I mount the iso in SUSE after downloading via http I can't install the Additions as I need to do this first

yast2 -install gcc gcc-c++ make kernel-source

as
&quot;The VirtualBox Guest Additions require the GNU C compiler, make utility and the Kernel-Source packages to be installed if not previously installed.&quot;

I see that the packages have been restricted to just the monovs ones.

Would you be able to change this or create a virtualbox vm with guest additions installed if you want to keep it locked down ?

Has been enjoyable playing with this beta, thank you !
