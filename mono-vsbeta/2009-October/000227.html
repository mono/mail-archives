<PRE>Hi,
thanks for your quick reply.

&gt;<i>Yes, this is how it finds the VM. The list box should be filled with
</I>&gt;<i>auto discovered VMs / MonoVS server side components, unless it was
</I>&gt;<i>unable to discover them. This can happen either because the VM is on a
</I>&gt;<i>separate network, or it's behind VMware's NAT. If VMware is in bridged
</I>&gt;<i>mode, then it finds it fine (that's normally how we test).
</I>
Well, it doesn't work here :)
My network configuration is unusual, anyway. I use Virtual PC rather than 
VMWare.
I have two network cards on my desktop machine, one directly connected to my 
ISP's MAN (I have up to 3 private IP addresses) with 39.x.x.x prefix and 
another one goes to Internet through my wireless router/NAT with 192.168.1.x 
prefix and connection to laptop and printer.
The VM is using the second network card, and it correctly gets address 
192.168.1.26 by DHCP. However I guess that the problem in the VM not being 
discovered is the following: MonoVS only uses MAN interface to broadcast.
I altered the metrics in my Ethernet interfaces to prioritize MAN against LAN, 
otherwise Windows would always use the NATted 100Mbps link rather than the 
direct 6Mbps link and this is bad for P2P. So I suppose MonoVS broadcasts only 
to the default interface, or there is a problem broadcasting to 
255.255.255.255 on all interfaces.

I just tried to disable my MAN interface and to use Wireshark, however not 
only I found no packet towards port 8805, but also I have another Windows 
interface that is the USB link to my PDA.

It worked after disconnecting both the MAN interface and the PDA cable, so I 
think this should be reviewed and is probably the reason why it doesn't work 
when behind NAT.

Finally, I tried to monitor packets to 255.255.255.255 and 192.168.1.255 with 
Wireshark but I found none, but MonoVS displayed the icon of the VM. Is there 
any magic behind it?

Regards,
Antonio
