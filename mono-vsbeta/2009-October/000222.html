<PRE>Hi Johnathan,

I tried a couple of things:

Looking at the /tmp directory, it takes around 20 seconds to create the
monovs-{guid} file after clicking &quot;Mono-&gt;Debug remotely in Mono&quot;. After
the file is created, it takes another minute or so to start the application.

When reaching a breakpoint, the IDE takes about 3 minutes to respond.
During this time, the VMWare network activity indicator icon doesn't
flash. On the last moment when control returns to the VS IDE, the light
flashes, which seems to indicate some communication.

Finally, pressing the stop button in the IDE works instantly, with no
delay. The file disappears from the tmp directory instantly too.
 
I couldn't get samba shared folders to work - my VMWare doesn't seem to
allow me to add shared folders, and Samba doesn't appear to be setup on
the Linux image.

Is there another way to profile what is happening with the communication
between the VS add-in and Linux?

Best regards,

Daryl
