<PRE>Hi all,

Firstly, thanks for the invite to this project.  As a .NET developer 
since Microsoft released version 1.0 (and hasn't it come a long way 
since...) I have been keen to follow Mono and Novell with their 
implementation.

So I installed all the stuff this morning and gave it the dry run, 
without changing anything in my real, every day projects.

A few observations:

1. The &quot;choose remote host&quot; dialog comes up with an empty list, but I 
guess it doesn't repaint or something, because clicking on it once 
immediately populates with where my Virtual PC Linux is running. 
Sometimes, however, it doesn't populate at all, but double-clicking in 
the empty list manages to connect to Linux anyway (I have no firewalls).

2. When using the MoMA analysis, if you have lots of projects in the 
solution (i.e. more than one), when it populates the error list, it 
always shows the name of one project, even though the source files can 
span many different projects.

3. Again with multiple projects in the solution, is it possible to add 
an option to the context menu of an individual project to do the various 
Mono options instead of the entire solution?

I'll admit my knowledge of actual Mono itself is a little patchy, so I'm 
not entirely sure on the level of support for Windows Forms is (I recall 
something to do with a wrapper for Gtk#..).  So when attempting to run a 
no-dependency Forms application straight into the Linux debugger, I get 
a crash on the Linux side:

System.InvalidOperationException: Operation is not valid due to the 
current state of the object (in Mono.VisualStudio.Mdb.ServerProcess)

I have a screenshot from the VPC VM (no Virtual PC additions for Linux, 
so can't cut and paste the actual text) - I would attach to the list, 
but unsure if it would get swallowed by Mailman.

I shall keep fiddling when I have a spare few moments, yet to try the 
local building yet.

Cheers,
Bart
