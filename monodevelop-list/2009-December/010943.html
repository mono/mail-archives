Hi,

I have exactly the same Problem as the poster starting this thread. Maybe I
can add some more details on that problem. The Console error messages I got
are identical to those already provided by Mark Materna, so I wont repeat
them.

<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Mono_Basics">http://www.mono-project.com/Mono_Basics</A> , so that doesn't seem to be the
problem.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Actually that username appears in all stacktrace lines mentioning
file-paths. I guess &quot;michael&quot; was the person doing the MonoDevelop build and
simply got his username engraved in the debugging symbols.

My system configuration:
  Model Name:	Power Mac G4 (AGP graphics)
  Model Identifier:	PowerMac3,1
  Processor Name:	PowerPC 60?  (2.2)
  Processor Speed:	2 GHz
  Number Of CPUs:	1
  L2 Cache (per CPU):	1 MB
  Memory:	1,5 GB
  Bus Speed:	100 MHz
  Boot ROM Version:	4.2.8f1

  System Version:	Mac OS X 10.5.8 (9L31a)
  Kernel Version:	Darwin 9.8.0


Mono was installed from: MonoFramework-2.6.1_1.macos10.novell.ppc.pkg (I had
also tried the universal variant instead of the ppc one, but it didn't make
any difference)

MonoDevelop was installed from: MonoDevelop-2.2.dmg (but SystemProfiler
lists it as Version 2.1.1)

Both the FAQ on the MonoDevelop website and the Notes.rtf acompanying the
Mono install package claim that MonoDevelop was included with the Mono
package, but I couldn't find it after installing Mono, so I had to resort to
installing it from above mentioned diskimage. I even tried to compile MD
from source, but the configure script fails to find the installed (and
working!) mono.   

Has anyone any clues where to go from here? Maybe there are some aditional
steps that have to be taken to get MonoDevelop up and running on a plain
vanilla MacOS X system?

Thanks in advance,

Stefan Pohl
