</I>
Hm, that sounds correct. I'm assuming you also built it within the
parallel runtime.

Another possibility is that MD is trying to *target* your /usr system
Mono - and I don't know if that works with mdb. Check what the active
runtime is in the &quot;project&quot;-&gt;&quot;active runtime&quot; menu (and the default in
prefs-&gt;&quot;.net runtimes&quot;).

&gt;<i> Questions:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) How can I ensure that I have a complete
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Parallel_Mono_Environments&quot;">http://www.mono-project.com/Parallel_Mono_Environments&quot;</A> ? I followed all
</I>&gt;<i> the directions. I s their a test ?
</I>
Unfortunately not, nope, but that's a good idea to have a test to
check the integrity of a Mono environment.

&gt;<i> 2) How does one enable the soft debugger
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Soft_Debugger&quot;">http://www.mono-project.com/Soft_Debugger&quot;</A> ?
</I>
It's enabled by default in Mono trunk and 2.6 branch, and in MD trunk
and 2.2 branch. As I described above, ensure that MD is targetting
your trunk/2.6 runtime, or the soft debugger will be disabled.

&gt;<i> &#160;Will it work under OS X as well ?
</I>
Yes, it works fine under OS X. It even works on iPhone :)

&gt;<i> Can it be used to debug an application if it embeds mono and is not a
</I>&gt;<i> purely csharp application ?
</I>
Yes, but you have to make certain embedding calls within you app to
turn the debugger on (and I'm not sure what they are offhand). You
would also need a (trivial) MD debug addin to make it listen for an
incoming soft debugger connection.

See moonlight and the MonoDevelop.Debugger.Soft.Moonlight addin for an example.

&gt;<i> 3) While building monodevelop I selected only Mdb,Gdb modules ? Are they
</I>&gt;<i> enough for most purposes ?
</I>
Yes, they are.

&gt;<i>Also could it possible that for the other modules
</I>&gt;<i> it is using the old mono
</I>
Highly unlikely IMO. When you run MD within MD, it only looks in the
current build for addins, and they get loaded inte the MD process. The
exception is the mdb debugger server that has to runs on the target
runtime.
