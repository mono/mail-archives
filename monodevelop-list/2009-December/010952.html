Correct, that was me :)

&lt;snip&gt;

</I>
Hm, maybe the application's Info.plist didn't get updated. but the 2.2
dmg is definitely the 2.2. release - you should see the correct number
in the About dialog.

&gt;<i> Both the FAQ on the MonoDevelop website and the Notes.rtf acompanying the

</I>&gt;<i> package, but I couldn't find it after installing Mono, so I had to resort to

Nope, it was removed some time ago. I guess someone forgot to update
those bits of information. I've fixed the FAQ.

&gt;<i> installing it from above mentioned diskimage. I even tried to compile MD
</I>&gt;<i> from source, but the configure script fails to find the installed (and
</I>&gt;<i> working!) mono.
</I>
The MD configure script uses pkgconfig to detect the Mono version,
which requires the C SDK package -- weird requirement, I know, but the
autotools build system is a pain to work with. You may find this page
useful:

</I>
Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure your issue is PPC-specific, and I don't
have a PPC machine. My replies to other users with this issue mention
a possible workaround.
