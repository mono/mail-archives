   - since the C# parser in monodevelop isn't completely finished, i

</I>&quot;Complete&quot; is a difficult word.  Most things in the base C# parser
(ICSharpCode.SharpRefactory) for C# &lt; 2 should be relatively complete.
I am less familiar with the portion in MonoDevelop.Base and
CSharpBinding, but if you need help with any of this please file a bug
and/or post to the list specific questions/issues and it should work
itself out (i.e. don't try to fix it all yourself).
