</I>One of the advantages of .NET Framework/Mono is the xcopy deployment 
capability of projects created with the respective frameworks.  The end 
game is the resulting code and its redistributable.  The build system 
files like NAnt XML documents, makefiles, csproj and prjx files can be 
all included in a zip file along with the source code.  I personally do 
that for projects like prj2make and for some other projects that I 
maintain. SharpDevelop and NDoc also had a practice of bundling both 
NAnt build files along with Visual Studio specific solution and/or 
project files.  I just redistribute my code with Visual Studio, 
MonoDevelop and nmake compatible make files (nmake is included with .NET 
Framework SDK so no need for Cygwin) and also with gmake compatible 
files.  While in win32 a Windows programmer could look into Visual C# 
.2003 Standard Edition (can be found for under $100) and couple that 
with things like the Mono combined  installer for Windows, vsprj2make, 
monolaunch and maybe the Gtk# Win32 installer for .NET Framework SDK. 

I have done some small contributions to MonoDevelop and almost all of my 
coding for those contributions took place in Windows with some 
integration testing taking place in Linux.  I, a primarily Win32 
developer, was able to help out with MonoDevelop from Windows without 
too much problem.  When it came time to do the Makefile.am for my 
MonoDevelop add-in all I spent was about 20 minutes to understand what 
needed to be done and put it to work.

MonoDevelop is fantastic and I use it when I am in my Linux boxes.  
Visual Studio is very, very good also and I use it when I am in 
Windows.  MonoDevelop in Windows? I certainly would use it but to me is 
so much important to just have the &quot;Best&quot; possible MonoDevelop in Linux!
