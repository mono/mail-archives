<PRE>Hello. Been trying to use MD 0.7.0.0 on FreeBSD (5.3), but I have
encountered some issues. Not sure what information you need so I'll just
list 'em and if you want or need more info, just let me know.

 

1)       The BSD# port information has the wrong file size and checksum for
the file of the same name on the FTP site (monodevelop-0.7.tar.gz) - likely
not of interest to you but maybe so.

2)       MD hangs frequently. When it happens the window doesn't redraw
except for (some of) the basic window areas (e.g. Solution, Code, Task List)
which redraw their basic rectangles in a lighter color then the rest of the
window. No controls are rendered. I have to Force Quit out of the
application and restart it.

a.       This can happen when I load an mdp file. Sometimes it will not
respond after I click the dialog button to load the file, sometimes it loads
the file (status message &quot;Combine loaded&quot;) but then locks up. 

b.       It can happen if the window is not active for a while (it was
working fine when last had focus), then I switch back and it hangs.

c.       It even sometimes happens when I am typing. This is the annoying
one because I lose changes to my source (of course).

3)       The code completion sometimes causes a CTD (crash to desktop).
Normally this happens when I invoke code completion with ctrl+space (it
crashes after the keystroke but before any code completion controls are
rendered), but not always.

4)       The File-&gt;Recent Solutions menu doesn't work. When I try to reload
a previously loaded solution, I get an error message saying &quot;Load operation
failed. File not found.&quot; However if I use the File-&gt;Open, I can open the
file (excepting 2.a).

 

Anyways. Great work on the project :-) I enjoy using it regardless of these
issues.

 

don.
