Yes, performance should not be a stopping factor (well, it isn't for NB
or Eclipse - both of which have their editors written in Java).

Porting SD's editor or maybe producing a feature compatible one is what
I'm after.

&gt;<i>

</I>
When talking about a tighter integration with a parser,  I was thinking
more about the editor to be more aware of the language it is displaying.
for example:

  - on the fly syntax checking (printing out syntax problems - like
eclipse does - or VS 2005)

  - more dynamic and context aware syntax highlighting (the 'value'
keyword in Setters - C#)

  - context aware indentation engines (empty lines with indentation -
VS.NET behaviour, code auto-styling engines - VS.NET 2005)

  - context aware code completion engines (expected types - useful in
'new' expressions)

  - auto-refactoring (the same as VS.NET 2005 - when changing names of
variables, types or methods...)

  - you name it :-)

I've got the impression that all of these features need some kind of
very tightly integrated (and smart) engine - an engine that knows the
language very well and also knows how to work with the editor...

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fully managed text buffers would alse be useful for having more than
</I>&gt;<i> one active view of a buffer, for split panes or different editor
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I was planning to look into SD, Eclipse and NetBeans (their code
actually) and only take the best design ideas from them.

I have a very vague idea on how source editors work... And already see,
that I will progress only slowly on this front...

Any help is very very much appreciated.

Enjoy
