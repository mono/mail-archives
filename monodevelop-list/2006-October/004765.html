Oh, I thought it is more about having an editor we can easily modify to
suit MonoDevelop's needs (or any other Mono apps for that matter). To
add new features as we go...

Well, MonoDevelop really is very featureful right now - in fact, there
is no immediate need for any kind of new editor editor, be it managed or
not - I agree.

He he, if we fail at producing a new and usable editor it will at least
not mean the end of the world :) Perhaps GtkSourceView will get much
better in the time we come up with a usable editor :) - would be even
cooler :)

If the endeavor in itself is not really prospective or practical, I
think it's at least fun to think about it :)


Enjoy,
