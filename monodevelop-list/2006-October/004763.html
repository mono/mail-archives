The managed editor under Unused/TextEditor is a really old port of the
#D editor from when MD's codebase was branched from SD. It would likely
be useful to do almost all of that work over again, but I don't know
what the diff to the original codebase is.

If you are looking to enhance the existing ported editor, one thing to
do right off for a quick performance gain is layout lines instead of
characters. To get something working quickly, we created a new
Pango.Layout for every character, which is *painful*, using one per
paragraph (where a paragraph has the pango meaning, ie explicit line
ending) would net you a large win.


Regardless of all of that, none of the features mentioned in a previous
email (pasted here)


  - on the fly syntax checking (printing out syntax problems - like
eclipse does - or VS 2005)

  - more dynamic and context aware syntax highlighting (the 'value'
keyword in Setters - C#)

  - context aware indentation engines (empty lines with indentation -
VS.NET behaviour, code auto-styling engines - VS.NET 2005)

  - context aware code completion engines (expected types - useful in
'new' expressions)

  - auto-refactoring (the same as VS.NET 2005 - when changing names of
variables, types or methods...)


would require a managed editor except (possibly) the dynamic and context
aware syntax highlighting. In fact, other than that feature (which is
the least useful of all the features mentioned), writing a new editor is
a step back, or at least sideways.
