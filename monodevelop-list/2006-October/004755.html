<PRE>Hi

for a long time now, I've been planning to somehow improve MD's source
editing experience with various kinds of coding assistance techniques.
Still, I have been only investigating - I have yet to do some coding...

I have looked into various IDEs: Eclipse, NetBeans and VS.NET 2005, and
the first thing I noticed about them is that they all have specially
crafted editors - to perfectly integrate into the IDE and to suit all
their needs.

Also, for a while, I've been looking into GtkSourceView's internals - in
order to help adding new features we'd need at MonoDevelop... Soon it
became clear that I'd have to be a dedicated GTK expert to even dare
dream about adding any kind of new features (not to mention the effort
needed to make new features available to Mono apps)... Anyways, I don't
see myself working on GtkSourceView - ever...

However, I'm more and more fond of the idea to create an editor designed
specifically for MonoDevelop (or any other Mono app).

Create a source editor with GTK# and Pango? Take a look at how
SharpDevelop's, NetBeans' or Eclipse's (my favourite) editors manage
things? Better integrate parsers with editors?

Lluis, is this a sane idea?


Enjoy,
---
Matej
