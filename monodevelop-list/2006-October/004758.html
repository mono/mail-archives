The only major issue you *might* have with a managed editor is
performance -- I think the #D guys had some trouble there IIRC -- but
there are plenty of advantages. You could even port #D's editor
directly from its current SWF to GTK#/Cairo/Pango, though I think that
MD's architecture has diverged quite a bit in that area. If you
implement the interfaces in MonoDevelop.Ide.Gui.Content, then most of
the existing text editing features should work fine. The #D book
(which is now free) might have some stuff about how they wrote the
editor. I remember seeing an interesting document a couple of years
back about how they'd designed it.

I don't know how useful integrating the editor with the parser would
be -- what ideas do you have in that area? I would more be thinking
about ease of adding code folding, error underlining, line
modification indication, complicated syntax highlighting schemes...

Fully managed text buffers would alse be useful for having more than
one active view of a buffer, for split panes or different editor
interfaces.
