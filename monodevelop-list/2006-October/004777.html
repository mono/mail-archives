Yep, I was thinking about this a while back, but such an editor would
really be too specialized for what would be needed in MonoDevelop and
Mono world.

You are right, a lot of things would open up.

For example, one could introduce totally different approaches to coding:

   imagine: you wouldn't type words anymore - you would mostly insert
snippets.
   for example: you don't use random words in C# - you use keywords or
defined variables - defined tokens. The editor would instantly know what
you can do at which place in your code - like code completion, but much
more integrated. You would not code through typing names, but through
refactoring.
   A totally different coding paradigm...

Stuff like that - a perfect research work! But I'd like something more
'tried' for MonoDevelop and Mono :)

But hey, nothing is hindering you to start such a project! (Except maybe
the lack of time - if you are experiencing it - I certainly do :) )
