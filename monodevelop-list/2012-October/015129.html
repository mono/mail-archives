<PRE>Which part are you struggling with?

If you want to create a custom widget then you can right-click on a 
project or folder, then click Add &gt; New Widget. It'll then prompt you 
for a name. Once you enter a name, it'll open the file (in source code 
view by default). Click on the &quot;Designer&quot; button at the bottom of the 
window and you'll see the designer view, which can be edited in the same 
way as any other form to create a composite widget.

To get your widget to show up in the MonoDevelop toolbox then you need 
to add:

         [System.ComponentModel.ToolboxItem(true)]

before the class definition, compile the code, and then click the &quot;+&quot; 
button at the top of the toolbox and click &quot;Add Assembly&quot;. Once you've 
added your assembly then you can select the controls to see.

If you want something a bit more advanced/customised (which won't 
necessarily fit in with GTK as well) then follow the same instructions 
but pick &quot;Custom Drawn Widget&quot; instead and you'll get a 
Gtk.DrawableArea, which gives you full control over the widget drawing.

Other than that then it depends on what you want the widget to do. Most 
of my custom widgets are combinations of other widgets in a fixed layout 
with appropriate hooks in place to keep values in sync between them. 
There's nothing special in the rendering, but the custom widget keeps 
consistency when a control is re-used.

Hope that helps a bit.
