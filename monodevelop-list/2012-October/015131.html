<PRE>I am trying to develop an enhanced version of C#. I feel it's important to
get it integrated into an IDE and I think MonoDevelop would be the most
straightforward choice (it's multiplatform, and I'll be using NRefactory as
a starting point). I hope there is a MSBuild/MD build system expert here to
help me...

My plan is to use a modified NRefactory to convert Enhanced C# (*.ecs) to
normal C# (*.cs) and then compile it with the standard C# compiler. The way
I would like it to work is that

1. MonoDevelop uses the modified NRefactory to provide code completion and
symbol lookup.
2. But, if possible, the project file should be backward compatible with
standard C# projects so that the project can build in Visual Studio without
any special add-in, e.g. the ecs =&gt; cs converter could be executed in a
pre-build event.
3. The user could choose to use EC# in only one or two source files in the
project, leaving the rest of the source files as plain C# to minimize their
dependence on EC# (EC# would examine the plain C# files but not generate
output for them); since EC# would increase build times, it would be nice to
have the option to avoid invoking the compiler when the EC# files have not
changed.

Does this sound feasible, or do I need to create a custom project format?
What would I have to do to make it work?

Thanks,
David
