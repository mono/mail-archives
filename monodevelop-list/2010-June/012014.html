<PRE>Hi,

Maybe some insight will arise from the collective here. I'm fairly new to this (especially with Linux, as I have most exclusively developed for Windows alone), and have often relied on the &quot;smarter guy down the hall...&quot; as it were anyway. ;)

I have an unmanaged shared library, both in Windows and Linux flavors, and am developing managed libraries for an application to run on both platforms (possibly also on OSX 10 down the road, but that bridge will be crossed in due course...). I am currently testing a CLI wrapper for the shared library. On Windows with .NET 3.5, there is no problem, of course. Works as designed (its a pretty thin wrapper). The plan is to then port it to Linux using Mono.

I am testing it on Linux, using the OpenSUSE/Mono virtual machine. On Linux the wrapper is unable to load the shared library. I've tried it with the dll mapping through a .config file, as the interoperability documentation on the Mono site describes, and have also built a Linux version of the wrapper with the platform specific naming in the DLLIMPORTs, both with and without the complete versioning. 

The Linux version of the shared library is in /usr/local/lib, and also /usr/lib. Should there be a different location for Mono to make the connection? Other suggestions?

Thanks in advance ;)

karen
