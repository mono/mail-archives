Okay, that all makes sense.

</I>
Depends. For some libraries we ship copies from source in contrib
(e.g. NRefactory, Cecil), but for others we ship binaries in the
addins (e.g. NUnit, Mono.Debugger.Soft). Debian/Ubuntu packagers hate
binaries, but they're a lot simpler for us to deal with, so I'd
suggest going that route initially.

&gt;<i> I like to commit incrementally, as I complete little areas of a feature.
</I>&gt;<i> Do you want me to keep submitting patches or is there plans to get me
</I>&gt;<i> commit access? &#160;Just asking, because there's going to be a lot of patches.
</I>
Usual procedure is for us to review and commit the first 4 or so
patches, then give you commit access. I guess this'll be easier when
we're using git :)

I'll leave the review to Lluis since he's most familiar with the VCS addin.

Thanks!
