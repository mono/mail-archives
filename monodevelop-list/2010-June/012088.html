I cannot find a way to change the language of the monodevelop IDE. I have
tried using LANG=us_EN.UTF-8  as suggested elsewhere, but it doesn't work,
and frankly it's completely ridiculous to have to use such method.

Just because I a located in some country, and have the locality settings set
to that country, it does not mean that I want my programs to be in that
language. It doesn't even mean that I understand that language. Why go with
the locality settings? Go with the windows language instead. My windows is
in english, which strongly suggests that I would also want any software I
install in english. The locality settings are set differently because they
have to fit with the keyboard and other local things.

The only correct way to do this, would be to give the option during
installation, and make it obvious for anyone how to chose english language,
without having to understand the local language to find such option.

What is perhaps the worst of all is that there doesn't even seem to be a way
to change the language at all. It's just unacceptable to me.

Sorry, but it really does annoy me when programs are set to danish just
because I happen to be in Denmark, and this is unfortunately not the only
one.

On top of it all, the danish translation is very bad. I cannot imagine any
programmers here actually wanting to use it.
