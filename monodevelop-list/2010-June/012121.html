<PRE>Hi,

The behaviour bothered me too.
I like your change.  So I'm for it :)

Cheers

 &gt; Hi all,
 &gt;
 &gt; I'm sending this email at the suggestion of Mike Krueger [1], who I've
 &gt; been bombarding with bugs and suggestions for the past month or so.
 &gt; Luckily he has been friendly and willing to fix/add/discuss my
 &gt; suggestions, so it has been a good experience.
 &gt;
 &gt; One suggestion that I made that Mike isn't so sure about is a change to
 &gt; the behaviour of the Class/Type drop-down at the top of the editor when
 &gt; the open file only contains a single class [2]. Currently, nothing is
 &gt; selected in the drop-down and so you've got to pick the only class from
 &gt; the list before you can pick a method/property from the second
 &gt; drop-down. In the &quot;one class per file&quot; use case then this seems like an
 &gt; extra click for no benefit.
 &gt;
 &gt; My suggestion is that the behaviour should be to select the class that
 &gt; can be unambiguously identified as the &quot;current&quot; class. If there are
 &gt; multiple classes then that would result in the current behaviour of
 &gt; selecting based on where the cursor is, or using the drop-down to poke
 &gt; the event in the opposite direction. If there is only one class in the
 &gt; file then there is no ambiguity between it and another class within that
 &gt; file and so I think it would help usability to treat any location within
 &gt; the file as being &quot;the class&quot; with regards what the drop-down selects.
 &gt;
 &gt; This isn't how Mike had planned for it to be used, but I think it makes
 &gt; sense in this situation. Rather than looking at as &quot;the drop-down shows
 &gt; the class your cursor is in&quot;, I'm looking at is as &quot;the drop-down shows
 &gt; the class you're working with&quot;. If there's only one class in a file then
 &gt; that &quot;class you're working with&quot; is unambiguous and so a selection could
 &gt; be made anyway. Once an extra class is added to the same file then it
 &gt; should drop back to the current multiple classes in a file behaviour.
 &gt;
 &gt; If anyone wants to test out the suggested behaviour then I've already
 &gt; made and submitted a patch [3] - hopefully my description above makes
 &gt; sense! Do people prefer the current behaviour and the extra click or do
 &gt; people think that my suggested patch makes sense for this situation?
