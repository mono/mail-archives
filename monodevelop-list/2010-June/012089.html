<PRE>After chatting with Lluis on the #monodevelop IRC channel this evening, I
am happy to announce that I will be volunteering my time to implement the
'Support for Git'[1] task for MonoDevelop 2.6.  I will be digging into the
specifics on how the Subversion add-in was done and implementing a Git
version very soon.

Any special instructions on where I should check-in my code?  I know the
Mono team is planning on making a switch to Git soon, sometime after the
2.8 release.  Is that the same for the MonoDevelop team?  Should this be
tracked in SVN like the other projects or should it be created in Git?  I
have a GitHub account[2] as an option for hosting it too.

I will also be working on an open source web based Git browser implemented
with ASP.NET MVC at the same time.  I have plans on integrating it
MonoDevelop in a generic way, hence my interest on working on this task. 
Features will include a code review system, repository management, and
tight bug tracker integration.

Due to my web application plans, I have been following the GitSharp[3]
library for quite some time.  It is progressing quite nicely and they are
planning to do a release in August.  I do not see any reason that using
this library should change from the initial task plans.

I use MonoDevelop on Linux as my primary IDE for development and I have
some experience with the MonoDevelop API.  I recently created an add-in to
bring MonoDevelop support to SpecFlow, which will be included in the next
release.  We're just waiting for the next patch to Mono 2.6 to release. 
We were also waiting on MonoDevelop 2.4, but it released today of course.

If you have any feedback on what you would like to see, just let me know. 
I have an account in BugZilla if there's accompanying tasks you want to
assign me.  My IRC handle is 'dragan'.  My twitter handle is '@dwragan'.

Cheers,

Dale Ragan
