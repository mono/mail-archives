<PRE>My thoughts,

&gt;&gt;<i> Depends. For some libraries we ship copies from source in contrib
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (e.g. NRefactory, Cecil), but for others we ship binaries in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> addins (e.g. NUnit, Mono.Debugger.Soft). Debian/Ubuntu packagers hate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> binaries, but they're a lot simpler for us to deal with, so I'd
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suggest going that route initially.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also hate this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hate it for many reasons:
</I>&gt;<i> * Not easy to upgrade the code
</I>&gt;<i> * Not easy to figure out which branch the code came from
</I>&gt;<i> * Not possible to track any changes that were made
</I>&gt;<i> * We end up with binaries on the tree, and I detest binaries
</I>&gt;<i> * We cant fix the code trivially if we wanted to
</I>&gt;<i> * It annoys every packager in the world
</I>&gt;<i> * No transparency as to what is behind the binaries
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The better option is to either make it a build-time requirement to have
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> package properly installed and available, or alternatively put the source
</I>&gt;<i> code side-by-side in the tree if we really need to keep all the source
</I>&gt;<i> code
</I>&gt;<i> in place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With GitSharp in particular, we will run into the issue that the library
</I>&gt;<i> will likely require Linux-specific and Mac-specific changes as the
</I>&gt;<i> GitSharp
</I>&gt;<i> hackers seem to be mostly Windows hackers.   A binary is the worst
</I>&gt;<i> possible
</I>&gt;<i> thing we can do.
</I>
Well, I assume the Mono and MonoDevelop projects will be moved to Git
before MonoDevelop 2.6 is released?  If that's the case, I would like to
present two options for a temporary basis.  Once we move to Git, we can
use one of Git's many ways to combine the projects from a fork of GitSharp
controlled by the MonoDevelop team.

  1. Put the binary in with MonoDevelop until the move.  As I update
     the binary during development of the add-in, I will include the
     hash of the commit from my fork for reference.

  2. Modify the build to grab the source from my fork based on a tag or
     branch name and put the clone in a directory we decide for the build.

On another note, they are definitely Windows hackers.  They use CRLF for
the line endings in the repository.  I cloned my repository last night on
my Linux box and I was greeted with a slew of changes when checking status
right after the clone.  I had to set autocrlf to false for the repository,
due to my global setting being set to input.  Since Git can be told to
convert the newlines to the system&#146;s standard when checking out files, and
to LF newlines when committing in by making Windows developer's set
autocrlf to true.  I decided to submit a message to Henon about a change
to make cross platform development more smoother by keeping the line
endings in the repo to LF.  He posted a message to the mailing list to
discuss the change to LF.

Later,

Dale
