Hi Scott,

I don't think using xml is more complex with the Welcome Page at all, seeing
as we are already creating an xml document before transforming it with the
xslt. The only thing that does change is that we will have a predefined xml
document and instead of generating one from scratch and append xml elements
to the existing document.

My personal opinion is that complexity does not always mean more maintenance
later. I am all for more complexity that makes maintenance less in the
future and in this case it means less maintenance.

I really think having the xml document storing the content makes it easier
to add and amend links and content for the welcome page, purely because the
content is not stored inside the formatted xslt document but rather inside
the xml document. It actually even simplifies the xslt as well, as all links
and actions will now be formatted in the same way, meaning more consistency.
Personally I think this is a win win situation that is not overly complex at
all. 

If you open the xml document that I submitted with the patch, it will become
apparent what I am referring to by maintaining the content etc.

Regards,

Gideon de Swardt
