The thing is, this addin does not change much.  When it does, it will be
between releases.  So, a dynamic setup really does not gain us anything.
That and the patch to do it in the way I described would be very small
and simple.  Which is always good.

But anyways, it doesn't really matter.  I have tried your patch and it
does not seem to break anything.  I am not familiar with the tricks you
used to get localization working, but if it does, great.  So, commiting
this patch is ok with me.

thanks for the effort,
Scott
