&gt;<i> Hello to all
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For this thread I would like to give my contribution. First of all I use

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 editor, but people mostly complain about it. I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 sure we can implement this for 1.0. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;               * Refactory operations. We have and under-used refactory
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 API. It would be nice to use it to implement some basic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 refactoring operations.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the Text Editor beside the Reflection (this is a huge point) I would
</I>&gt;<i> like that MD Text Editor should be able to Collapse and Decollapse
</I>&gt;<i> #regions.
</I>&gt;<i> With this we could organize our code better.
</I>
The problem is that support for hiding text in Gtk.TextView is only
available since GTK 2.8, and MD is targeting right now GTK 2.4. Maybe we
can switch to 2.8 after the release.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Other feature that should be easy to implement is the comment of class
</I>&gt;<i> or methods. Using /// command, the Text Editor should enter all the
</I>&gt;<i> prototype of the Class or Method comment. That information should be
</I>&gt;<i> exported to a MonoDoc File.  
</I>
Monodoc does not use the /// comments to extract documentation. It has
its own tools for scanning source code and building documentation pages
from it which can then be edited using the help browser. One of the
TODOs (out of the scope of 1.0) is to improve the documentation add-in
so it can automate all this process.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Resolve some problems with identation.
</I>
Could you please file a bug report explaining what those problems are?
We won't be able to resolve them otherwise.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * ASP.NET support: I don't know if this add-in can be mature
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         enough for the 1.0 release. I'll need input on that (which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         features could we release? would the add-in be really useful for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         real world web projects?).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That will not be good. I develop most of my application with ASP.NET
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * NUnit: It can be considered feature complete for 1.0. The only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         missing issue to resolve is what to do with the NUnit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         dependency. Right now the add-in can't be built with recent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         NUnit versions since they have breaking changes. I talked about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         this with Charlie Poole in the Mono summit and he suggested to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         embed the most recent NUnit dlls into the add-in, since even if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         the API has some breaking changes, new NUnit versions can still
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         run tests written for all the previous versions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why should we have TDD integration in MonoDevelop? One of the good
</I>&gt;<i> things in TDD software is that we can right-click on a Test Method and
</I>&gt;<i> run it from there.
</I>&gt;<i> How hard will be to implement this?
</I>
I think it's easy to implement. I'll take a look.

Thanks for your feedback!
Lluis.
