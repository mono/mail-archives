<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i>       * Documentation browser: The Monodoc integration more or less
</I>&gt;<i>         works, but there are some known crashes. However I still believe
</I>&gt;<i>         that showing Monodoc in an external window would be more
</I>&gt;<i>         practical that the current integrated view. The integrated
</I>&gt;<i>         documentation tree is not really useful, we don't have search or
</I>&gt;<i>         an index integrated.
</I>
I find that the tooltips with documentation are liked by everyone, it
would be a shame to miss that.

But moving the rest of Monodevelop is a good idea.

&gt;<i>               * Configurable key bindings. That's not specific to the
</I>&gt;<i>                 editor, but people mostly complain about it. I'm not
</I>&gt;<i>                 sure we can implement this for 1.0. 
</I>
I vote for not wasting time on this one for 1.0;   Specially if there
are considerations about upgrading the editor.

Configurable keybindings, done right is a whole universe on its own
(usability, hooks, code, hacks, workarounds, testing)

&gt;<i>               * Support for some missing controls, such as Gtk.Fixed and
</I>&gt;<i>                 context menus. It would be nice to have a TreeView
</I>&gt;<i>                 designer, but it may be too much work for 1.0. 
</I>
Agreed;  GtkFixed will answer a lot of questions and take away some of
the confusion that people experience.

I agree that the TreeView designer is probably too much work to do, it
sounds like a great 1.2 feature.

&gt;<i>       * MonoQuery database management: I have no idea of what is the
</I>&gt;<i>         status of this add-in. I have never really used it. Can somebody
</I>&gt;<i>         give input about it? Do we want to support it for 1.0?
</I>
If this is the same as the database management one, the idea is great,
but the code is very flaky.   When I tried using it a few times, it
consistently crashed MonoDevelop, I did not report bugs, considering
that the code seemed to be abandoned.

&gt;<i>       * NUnit: It can be considered feature complete for 1.0. The only
</I>&gt;<i>         missing issue to resolve is what to do with the NUnit
</I>&gt;<i>         dependency. Right now the add-in can't be built with recent
</I>&gt;<i>         NUnit versions since they have breaking changes. I talked about
</I>&gt;<i>         this with Charlie Poole in the Mono summit and he suggested to
</I>&gt;<i>         embed the most recent NUnit dlls into the add-in, since even if
</I>&gt;<i>         the API has some breaking changes, new NUnit versions can still
</I>&gt;<i>         run tests written for all the previous versions.
</I>
I agree.

&gt;<i>       * Version Control: I recently integrated some of the changes done
</I>&gt;<i>         for the Google SoC project and improved it a lot. Support for
</I>&gt;<i>         SVN is mostly functional. What's missing is support for CVS. It
</I>&gt;<i>         would be nice to have for MD 1.0.
</I>
Yeah, but I would not delay 1.0 waiting for CVS support.  

&gt;<i>       * Welcome page: It looks ok to me.
</I>
I would add an iframe that renders the latest news from the Mono and
MonoDevelop projects.  Maybe it should render a special RSS feed
specific for MonoDevelop, so we can push content there that matters to
MonoDevelop users (articles, releases, etc).

&gt;<i>       * Web references: I'd like to integrate the web references add-in
</I>&gt;<i>         implemented by Gideon de Swardt. The only problem I see is that
</I>&gt;<i>         it only supports .NET 2.0 projects. It would be nice to make it
</I>&gt;<i>         work for 1.1 as well.
</I>
Agreed.

&gt;<i>       * Xml editor: It's being maintained outside of MD, so nothing to
</I>&gt;<i>         add. Just to make sure it works when we release 1.0.
</I>
Where do we get this?   Never seen it.

&gt;<i>       * VB.NET: I don't think there is support for generics. We may want
</I>&gt;<i>         to migrate to the new VB compiler.
</I>
It might be too early, considering your timeline.

Miguel
