Ok.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  But having external monodoc  GUI is quite memory-expensive. I

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> switch in preferences to use  internal/external monodoc, ha?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's a possibility. My concern is that there are many features   
</I>&gt;<i> (such  as search or index) that are not supported by the integrated  
</I>&gt;<i> doc  browser. So right now I think it would be easier to just start   
</I>&gt;<i> monodoc.exe in an external process (and communicate with it maybe   
</I>&gt;<i> using  remoting), rather than trying to integrate all those features  
</I>&gt;<i> in MD.
</I>
So you think that having MD and monodoc GUI in one Mono VM is a bad  
idea?

&gt;<i> As Rafael pointed out, MD already has a command line build tool.
</I>
Yes, thank you and Rafael.

&gt;<i>  There is a standalone Stetic designer. The plan is to release it in   
</I>&gt;<i> sync  with MD 1.0, so you could use it to design your forms even when  
</I>&gt;<i> not  using MD.
</I>
I'll look at it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  * MonoQuery database management: I have no idea of what is the   
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> status  of this add-in. I have never really used it. Can  somebody   
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> give  input about it? Do we want to support it for 1.0?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Ok. MonoQuery brings a great idea of having access to Databases,   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that  are used for application development. But for this purpose it   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> misses   several things.  1. It should store it's configuration data  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in Solution file, not in  MD  config dir. In other words, it should  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be per project.  2. It should make use of reflections. Requiring  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sybase, IBM DB2 is  overkill for RAD/IDE. The DB code, that uses  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reflection can be  found  in  SqlSharpGtk project:   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/project/?sqlsharpgtk">http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/project/?sqlsharpgtk</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, that's my concern. Looks like this add-in is not complete enough  
</I>&gt;<i> and  that nobody is maintaining it. Do you think it is worth  
</I>&gt;<i> including it  in  MD 1.0 in its current status?
</I>
IMO MonoQuery is stable enough and useful enough to be included in 1.0.  
What I pointed before is a wish list to polish it.

&gt;&gt;<i>  IMHO AFAIK the SCM, that's going to become a winner is GIT. Any   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> plans?
</I>&gt;<i> If anybody wants to work on it, that would be awesome.
</I>
I see.

&gt;<i> &gt; Well, the good news is: Nemerle project already preparing to 1.0
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; release in similar way, as MD. So I expect that it will enter the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; feature freeze / ABI freeze early enough to be MD-1.0-ready.
</I>&gt;<i> That would be great!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  I'd like  to listen to the guy, who made a great effort to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nemerle-lang  AddIn.  As  soon, as I build SVN version of MD, I'll  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make some bug reports.  In fact, as for MD-0.12 + Nemerle SVN is  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quite good and useful.
</I>
I just hope that &quot;that&quot; guy will be there, when it comes to 1.0
