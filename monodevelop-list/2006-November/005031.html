I hate to jump in late in the game, but is supporting general  
variable code completion (i.e. I can start to type m_Con and a dialog  
with m_ConnectSocket and m_ConnectionList (or something) pops up?)  
part of that Text Editor clause?

When talking about NUnit integration, has anybody brought up NAnt as  
an option for builds instead of the &quot;MonoDevelop build system?&quot;


In terms of documentation, bringing Monodoc out into a more usable  
window with index searching, etc will do more than anything else  
IMHO ;) As for MD documentation,. I think a tutorial for creating a  
two project'd solution (possibly a web service and the app that uses  
the webservice) would be beneficial, as well as using Boo in a MD  
workflow (besides to zombie on my openSUSE 10.1 machine, I still  
haven't a bloody clue as to what boo is useful for ;))

I would also recommend finding somebody with a less monotone voice  
than RevFry, who's knowledgeable to create screencasts (which have  
helped Textmate's popularity IMMENSELY i think) to walk users through  
some of the more simple and then increasingly complex uses for  
MonoDevelop. I'd be willing to give this a shot, but I am a terrible  
MD user, I really just use it for an editor and then NAnt (I need a  
cross-platform build system) for most projects.


Other than that, Lluis, the roadmap looks nice, looking forward to it :)
