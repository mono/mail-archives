<PRE>Hi!

&gt;<i> and first of all, the due kudos to all monodevelop developers on this
</I>&gt;<i> list. It is the best IDE available on Linux and that's all needed to
</I>&gt;<i> say. Now to ChangeLog..
</I>
Thanks!

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When using emacs I find myself writing much more detailed ChangeLogs
</I>&gt;<i> than when using MD, because MD's ChangeLog add-in is a little bit picky
</I>&gt;<i> about when you can insert an entry or header. I have a patch that
</I>&gt;<i> changes the default behaviour in the following ways:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1/ Just one command &quot;Insert ChageLog Entry&quot;, an header is automatically
</I>&gt;<i> added if missing or if the top-most header is different from the one
</I>&gt;<i> we're about to add.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2/ The command can be issued from anywhere and the add-in looks for the
</I>&gt;<i> right ChangeLog file and even creates one if necessary. It looks for
</I>&gt;<i> ChangeLog in the current project, then in its parent combine and so on,
</I>&gt;<i> up to the top-most combine. If no ChangeLog is found, one is created in
</I>&gt;<i> the current project directory. So if you like a single top-level
</I>&gt;<i> ChangeLog just create an empty one in the combine before adding the
</I>&gt;<i> first entry, else let the plugin create one in the project for you.
</I>
&gt;<i> The code is quite dirty, I plan to clean it up and add a couple of
</I>&gt;<i> features or two if you like the patch. The diff is for current HEAD,
</I>&gt;<i> taken from the top directory (i.e., monodevelop) and attached to this
</I>&gt;<i> email.
</I>
There are some indentation issues, but other than that it looks ok to
me.

+ // TODO: Is there a better way to bring a new document to front?
+ IdeApp.Workbench.OpenDocument(document.FileName,
true);                    

Yes: document.Select ()

Now, I'm improving right now the version control add-in and I think it
would be nice to integrate into it ChangeLog support. My idea is the
following:
* Using the Status view the user can see what has changed in a
directory.
* In that view, it can select files that have changed and enter comments
about the change.
* When clicking on Commit, MD would collect all comments, update the
changelog file (following the same rules you propose) and commit using
the same comments as commit message.

I think this would save a lot of work.

Lluis.
