<PRE>I forgot some points:

* Implement Feature. When we want to implement a Interface in our class,
there should be a Implement feature to create the prototype of the
Interface in our class.... There is a VS2005 feature like that too.

* A close window shortcut. Using the CTRL+F4 (for example) the MD should
close the code or design window open. This feature drop the use of the
Mouse the close a Windows.

* With CTRL + TAB should be able to navigate through the open windows in
MD.

* Should be a tool tip in the window name that will give is full path
and (if it's possible) the project that the file in.


Some other point can be made as add-in but I still point them here. 
In VS2005 there is a Add-in that give us a factor of complexity and Nr
of Lines of the methods.
This tool using with Refactoring will improve the developer code.

Hope this is all

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 sure we can implement this for 1.0. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;               * Refactory operations. We have and under-used refactory
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 API. It would be nice to use it to implement some basic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 refactoring operations.

</I>&gt;<i> In the Text Editor beside the Reflection (this is a huge point) I would
</I>&gt;<i> like that MD Text Editor should be able to Collapse and Decollapse
</I>&gt;<i> #regions.
</I>&gt;<i> With this we could organize our code better.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Other feature that should be easy to implement is the comment of class
</I>&gt;<i> or methods. Using /// command, the Text Editor should enter all the
</I>&gt;<i> prototype of the Class or Method comment. That information should be
</I>&gt;<i> exported to a MonoDoc File.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Resolve some problems with identation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * ASP.NET support: I don't know if this add-in can be mature
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         enough for the 1.0 release. I'll need input on that (which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         features could we release? would the add-in be really useful for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         real world web projects?).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That will not be good. I develop most of my application with ASP.NET
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * NUnit: It can be considered feature complete for 1.0. The only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         missing issue to resolve is what to do with the NUnit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         dependency. Right now the add-in can't be built with recent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         NUnit versions since they have breaking changes. I talked about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         this with Charlie Poole in the Mono summit and he suggested to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         embed the most recent NUnit dlls into the add-in, since even if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         the API has some breaking changes, new NUnit versions can still
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         run tests written for all the previous versions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why should we have TDD integration in MonoDevelop? One of the good
</I>&gt;<i> things in TDD software is that we can right-click on a Test Method and
</I>&gt;<i> run it from there.
</I>&gt;<i> How hard will be to implement this?
