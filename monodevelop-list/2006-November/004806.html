It's the addin.

</I>
I started the AddIn around a year or so ago, not related to the SoC, and
then I promptly got distracted and didn't work on it (much) again.  At
the time I hadn't seen any particularly promising Subversion libraries,
and wrapping Subversion's native library turned into an interesting
challenge.  (Avoiding P/Invoking has its own problems, i.e. programming
against an API is much easier than trying to interface with a program by
shelling it and passing it command line arguments, and then parsing its
output.)

As for compatibility with Win32... I imagine that the same libraries
used on Linux are available on Win32 as DLLs, though I don't know for sure.

(Btw, the recent changes look great!)
