<PRE>Having been following the progress of monodevelop for a while now, I must say that I am highly impressed with the project and am excited for a 1.0 release. I would like to help out in any way I can in order to see 1.0 be the best release yet :)

Having said that, I must confess that I am limited in my coding ability. On the other hand, I learn quickly and have lots of time on my hands. Therefore, I could handle some of the simple-yet-tedious aspects of the development, if there are any.

So for what its worth, I offer my help to anyone who wants it. Just tell me what to do :)
