<PRE>El dj 23 de 11 del 2006 a les 15:42 +0000, en/na Tom Potts va escriure:
&gt;<i> To call it 1.0 without the debugger doesn't seem right to me.
</I>&gt;<i>  I'd almost say the same for ASP.NET but I can imagine that XSP would need  
</I>&gt;<i> debugging too to be consistent...
</I>
We can discuss forever what &quot;1.0&quot; means. At the end somebody will say
that if MD does not have the same feature set that Visual Studio or
Eclipse has it is not right to call it 1.0. The reality is that the
project does not have enough contributors for doing everything. We have
to go step by step.

Maybe MD 1.0 won't have everything people expects from an IDE, but well,
we didn't make any commitment. People will use it if they find it
useful, and I believe that MD has enough features to be useful for a lot
of people. 

&gt;<i>  Having said that I'm not sure I can help much - perhaps Martin can contact me 
</I>&gt;<i> if there is anything I can have a look at?
</I>
If you are really interested in helping, maybe you should take the
initiative and contact him.

Thanks!
Lluis.
