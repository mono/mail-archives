I would consider holding off 1.0 until the debugger is ready.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I don't think I would remove functionality.  If people like it they can
use it.

&gt;<i>       * Welcome page: It looks ok to me.

One thing I thought of was adding a news section which would display the
Mono RSS feed.  That would be pretty cool.

</I>&gt;<i>                 delegate the entire build process to Make, and still be
</I>&gt;<i>                 able to launch the build from inside MD. About modifying
</I>&gt;<i>                 the Makefile in MD, I think supporting adding/removing
</I>&gt;<i>                 files would be enough for now. 
</I>
I assume you mean on deploy to tarball.  That wouldn't be too hard.
Just add a setting which prevents the overwriting of the current
autotools files.

&gt;<i>               * We need to find a solution for file templates (.in
</I>&gt;<i>                 files). MD uses some of them. We need to support them in
</I>&gt;<i>                 the MD build model if we want to be able to completely
</I>&gt;<i>                 build MD using MD. 
</I>
yes that is a tough one.  I think you have to actually build it into the
MD project functionality.  I think the better solution would be to find
another way to do what you were doing with templates.

&gt;<i>               * There may be other missing features needed for
</I>&gt;<i>                 self-hosting MD. 
</I>
likely.

&gt;<i>               * It would be nice to support generating a tarball without
</I>&gt;<i>                 having to pollute the project directory with autotools
</I>&gt;<i>                 files. 
</I>
yes it would.

&gt;<i> As you can see that's a lot of work. I think we should prioritize
</I>&gt;<i> working on features related with development GNOME desktop applications
</I>&gt;<i> (which has been the main goal of MD anyway).
</I>
The other things are the freedesktop *.desktop entries and MIME types
(as mentioned at <A HREF="http://www.monodevelop.com/Autotools">http://www.monodevelop.com/Autotools</A> ) which pertain
directly to developing GNOME applications.  We had discussed abstracting
this stuff into a DesktopTools addin, but I have recently started a new
job and have had little energies for additional coding.
