Web services can be created right now -- there's a Web Service file
template that can be added to Web Application projects.

I think that the basic ASP.NET support is most of the way there, and
can certainly be polished enough for the release. It should then be
usable for real-world projects.

Things that *need* doing for AspNetAddIn are, IMO,
  * Handling referenced assemblies, i.e. web.config (medium)
  * Checks for XSP before trying to run it (easy)
  * Web deployment (medium, code mostly done for this, but *requires*
core changes)
  * Icons (easy, time-consuming)
  * Handle &quot;special folders&quot; (easy/medium, some code done)
I probably will be able to handle these myself, except getting the
deployment changes into core (Lluis?).

Things I would quite like to do, but most likely won't have time for:
 * Text editor toolbox support, for ASP.NET/HTML snippets (easy/medium).
 * Special folders for ASP.NET 2.0, incl App_Code etc (medium).
 * CodeBehind tabs at the bottom of windows, but this will involve
some fairly complicated changes to get it working reliably, including
changes to Core (medium/hard).
 * Allow launching site in different browsers (easy).
 * Some additional templates, e.g. web service project (easy)
 * Live parsing of Web Forms to push member declarations into
CodeBehind (this already is done at compile time, so probably not too
hard).

Anything beyond this, especially stabilising the Visual Designer and
making it properly useful, probably cannot be achieved in this
timeframe, at least by me.
