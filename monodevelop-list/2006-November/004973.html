<PRE>Hello to all

For this thread I would like to give my contribution. First of all I use
to be a Micro$oft programmer and I use use all day the VS2005. There is
some issues that I would like to insert.

I would be the first guy that want this, but at this time we can use the
man/power and do anything else. 

&gt;<i>       * Text editor: There are several requests/issues to solve: 
</I>&gt;<i>               * Parameter completion: after typing the name of a method,
</I>&gt;<i>                 show a popup window with information about the
</I>&gt;<i>                 parameters the method takes. 
</I>&gt;<i>               * Remove C#-isms. The code completion engine has several
</I>&gt;<i>                 C#-isms in the code, which may make it difficult to
</I>&gt;<i>                 integrate with other languages. 
</I>&gt;<i>               * Configurable key bindings. That's not specific to the
</I>&gt;<i>                 editor, but people mostly complain about it. I'm not
</I>&gt;<i>                 sure we can implement this for 1.0. 
</I>&gt;<i>               * Refactory operations. We have and under-used refactory
</I>&gt;<i>                 API. It would be nice to use it to implement some basic
</I>&gt;<i>                 refactoring operations.
</I>
In the Text Editor beside the Reflection (this is a huge point) I would
like that MD Text Editor should be able to Collapse and Decollapse
#regions.
With this we could organize our code better.

Other feature that should be easy to implement is the comment of class
or methods. Using /// command, the Text Editor should enter all the
prototype of the Class or Method comment. That information should be
exported to a MonoDoc File.  

Resolve some problems with identation.

&gt;<i>       * ASP.NET support: I don't know if this add-in can be mature
</I>&gt;<i>         enough for the 1.0 release. I'll need input on that (which
</I>&gt;<i>         features could we release? would the add-in be really useful for
</I>&gt;<i>         real world web projects?).
</I>
That will not be good. I develop most of my application with ASP.NET

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>       * NUnit: It can be considered feature complete for 1.0. The only
</I>&gt;<i>         missing issue to resolve is what to do with the NUnit
</I>&gt;<i>         dependency. Right now the add-in can't be built with recent
</I>&gt;<i>         NUnit versions since they have breaking changes. I talked about
</I>&gt;<i>         this with Charlie Poole in the Mono summit and he suggested to
</I>&gt;<i>         embed the most recent NUnit dlls into the add-in, since even if
</I>&gt;<i>         the API has some breaking changes, new NUnit versions can still
</I>&gt;<i>         run tests written for all the previous versions.
</I>
Why should we have TDD integration in MonoDevelop? One of the good
things in TDD software is that we can right-click on a Test Method and
run it from there.
How hard will be to implement this?
