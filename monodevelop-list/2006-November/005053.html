&gt;<i> Hello again
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I remember that would be great that we could have a Solution Folder. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Solution Folder is a Virtual Folder in MD Solution Tree where we could

</I>&gt;<i> Solution Folder we can do that.
</I>
How is this different from support for nested solutions (which we
already have)?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think  that VS2005 has this feature but I can't be sure.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi all!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; After several years of development MonoDevelop is beginning to be really
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; useful to develop real applications, so I think it makes sense to start
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; planning a stable 1.0 release. My proposal is the following:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * MD beta 1 release around mid January (two months from now). In
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         this release we would include most of the missing features for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         1.0 (see below). We would do code freeze at this point.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * MD beta 2 (or RC) release around mid February. Mainly bug fixes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         and memory usage reduction. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * MD 1.0 release around mid March. It will include the latest bug
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         fixes. I also think we should work on writing documentation for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         this release, specially tutorials.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, which features is MD 1.0 going to include?. I'd like to get input
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from contributors and users about that, but I think what we should do is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to finish and polish what we already have.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I went through all add-ins and I have written down some notes about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what's missing on each of them (bugs aside):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * MonoDevelop core: The core can be considered complete now. No
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         major new features are planned. However, we need to make an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         audit of the API to make sure we don't have public classes or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         methods which don't really need to be public. I'd like also to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         find some time to reorganize a bit the extension point tree
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         (which has a mixture of SharpDevelop and MonoDevelop branches),
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         to something like what I described some months ago:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/monodevelop-list/2006-January/003077.html">http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/monodevelop-list/2006-January/003077.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * Debugger: I know a lot of people will ask for this, but I fear
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         the debugger won't be ready by our code freeze date. We can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         release it later on as a separate add-in.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * Documentation browser: The Monodoc integration more or less
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         works, but there are some known crashes. However I still believe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         that showing Monodoc in an external window would be more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         practical that the current integrated view. The integrated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         documentation tree is not really useful, we don't have search or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         an index integrated.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * Text editor: There are several requests/issues to solve: 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;               * Parameter completion: after typing the name of a method,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 show a popup window with information about the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 parameters the method takes. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;               * Remove C#-isms. The code completion engine has several
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 C#-isms in the code, which may make it difficult to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 integrate with other languages. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;               * Configurable key bindings. That's not specific to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 editor, but people mostly complain about it. I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 sure we can implement this for 1.0. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;               * Refactory operations. We have and under-used refactory
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 API. It would be nice to use it to implement some basic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 refactoring operations.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * VS importer: Ankit is working on supporting VS2005 files right
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         now. The idea is that you can open VS files directly in MD and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         work with those projects like if they were native projects. It
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         will support writing changes such as adding files or modifying
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         the project configuration. Ideally, we should do the same for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         VS2003 (right now it only supports importing for VS2003
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         projects).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * ASP.NET support: I don't know if this add-in can be mature
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         enough for the 1.0 release. I'll need input on that (which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         features could we release? would the add-in be really useful for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         real world web projects?).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * GTK# designer: There are several features to be implemented in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         the designer before the release: 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;               * Support partial classes when generating code. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;               * Support for Undo/Redo. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;               * Reuse the toolbox implemented for the ASP.NET add-in. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;               * Support for some missing controls, such as Gtk.Fixed and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 context menus. It would be nice to have a TreeView
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 designer, but it may be too much work for 1.0. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * MonoQuery database management: I have no idea of what is the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         status of this add-in. I have never really used it. Can somebody
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         give input about it? Do we want to support it for 1.0?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * NUnit: It can be considered feature complete for 1.0. The only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         missing issue to resolve is what to do with the NUnit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         dependency. Right now the add-in can't be built with recent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         NUnit versions since they have breaking changes. I talked about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         this with Charlie Poole in the Mono summit and he suggested to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         embed the most recent NUnit dlls into the add-in, since even if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         the API has some breaking changes, new NUnit versions can still
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         run tests written for all the previous versions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * Version Control: I recently integrated some of the changes done
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         for the Google SoC project and improved it a lot. Support for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         SVN is mostly functional. What's missing is support for CVS. It
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         would be nice to have for MD 1.0.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * Welcome page: It looks ok to me.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * Web references: I'd like to integrate the web references add-in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         implemented by Gideon de Swardt. The only problem I see is that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         it only supports .NET 2.0 projects. It would be nice to make it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         work for 1.1 as well.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * Xml editor: It's being maintained outside of MD, so nothing to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         add. Just to make sure it works when we release 1.0.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * Boo: I think this add-in is complete, but I'd also like to know
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         the opinion of Peter about this. In any case, there is one issue
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         that should be fixed: right now the Boo add-in always starts an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         external process which runs the backend for the Boo shell. This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         process should only be started if the user opens the shell,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         since it's a waste of memory otherwise.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * CSharp: It is mostly complete. We may need to add support for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         partial classes. I'm not sure they are correctly handled by the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         parser right now.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * ILAsm: I haven't used it for a long time. I guess it works.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * Java: It's mostly complete, although there are some IKVM
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         configuration issues that need to be fixed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * VB.NET: I don't think there is support for generics. We may want
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         to migrate to the new VB compiler.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * Nemerle: Don't know much about the status. Any input? The big
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         problem I find is that it depends on a specific version of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         Nemerle from SVN. If it can't be made to depend on a packaged
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         Nemerle version we won't be able to include it in the MD
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         release.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * ChangeLog add-in: It's now integrated with the version control
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         add-in. There are ideas for improving it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * Autotools: There are several features I'd like to support for MD
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         1.0: 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;               * Support integration with existing Makefiles. That is, if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 somebody has a project with complex build rules which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 can't be emulated by MD, just make it possible to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 delegate the entire build process to Make, and still be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 able to launch the build from inside MD. About modifying
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 the Makefile in MD, I think supporting adding/removing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 files would be enough for now. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;               * We need to find a solution for file templates (.in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 files). MD uses some of them. We need to support them in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 the MD build model if we want to be able to completely
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 build MD using MD. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;               * There may be other missing features needed for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 self-hosting MD. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;               * It would be nice to support generating a tarball without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 having to pollute the project directory with autotools
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 files. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * IDE extensions for Mono: Nothing much to do. Just make sure it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         works with the most recent Mono makefiles.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As you can see that's a lot of work. I think we should prioritize
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; working on features related with development GNOME desktop applications
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (which has been the main goal of MD anyway).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd like to get feedback about this plan. I may not have a complete view
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of every add-in, and I'm sure I'm missing things.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Lluis.
