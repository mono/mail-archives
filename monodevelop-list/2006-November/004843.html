<PRE>Hello all, I am being taught C# in university and as such need to practice
it and I would be quite happy playing with mono and gtk# using mono develop
but am clueless as to how to start.

Basically i was to create a window with a button that when pressed will
display the text 'hello world' in a label, and i honestly can't work out how
to accomplish anything with the IDE. I would like to learn it's just hard
when there is not many available tutorials.

Many thanks
Neil Munro
