<PRE>Gideon de Swardt escribi&#243;:
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Guideon, this is wonderful work! I have tried your patch and works ok
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; (except, strangely, that the sentence &quot;Common Actions&quot; hasn't been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; translated although I did so on my es.po local copy... I don't know
</I>&gt;<i> why...).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for the feedback on the patch. I will have quickly look why the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Common Actions&quot; is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not being translated and submit a new patch that will fix this problem.
</I>
&gt;<i> I had a quickly look, and the &quot;Common Actions&quot; string is actually being
</I>&gt;<i> extracted by intltool-update and merge into the po files, and the xslt
</I>&gt;<i> is also using the string specified from the xml document. Could you
</I>
I know, that's why I thought it was very strange. But I just have found
out what was the problem: it turns out that the lines that begin with #,
in the .po file, are ignored, *except* those ones that indicate the
fuzzy keyword. In my last translation commits, I removed the fuzzy line
so as a maintainable technique for me to know that the fuzzy strings had
been corrected, but now I see that it's even mandatory :)

This has happened to me because I wrote some localized strings fastly so
as to only try your patch, without paying attention to the localization.

Then, IMO this should be commited! Thanks,

	Andr&#233;s	[ knocte ]

&gt;<i> please attach your es.po file, so that I can test it with that?
</I>
</PRE>
