Interesting. I will try to find one copy. Thanks.

I would like to see the reasons behind this, heck, it's one of the
reasons I'll start this as a research and coding exercise for some of my
classes in the next semester (or even during the SoC ;D ). Currently,
there's too much going on around here. And I have to get my school and
other assignments done in time... (Staying up until 5:00 AM regularly is
really doing me in...)


If anyone is going to start before I get to it, I'll do as well as I can
to somehow contribute ;-)


Enjoy,
