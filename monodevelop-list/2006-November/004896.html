<PRE>Hi! This is great news for MD!

Here goes mi opinion:

Lluis Sanchez escribi&#243;:
&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i>       * Debugger: I know a lot of people will ask for this, but I fear
</I>&gt;<i>         the debugger won't be ready by our code freeze date. We can
</I>&gt;<i>         release it later on as a separate add-in.
</I>
I also think that this is going to be the most requested feature.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>       * Text editor: There are several requests/issues to solve: 
</I>&gt;<i>               * Parameter completion: after typing the name of a method,
</I>&gt;<i>                 show a popup window with information about the
</I>&gt;<i>                 parameters the method takes. 
</I>
This is very interesting, but I noted you didn't mention about
supporting overloading?


&gt;<i>       * VS importer: Ankit is working on supporting VS2005 files right
</I>&gt;<i>         now. The idea is that you can open VS files directly in MD and
</I>&gt;<i>         work with those projects like if they were native projects. It
</I>&gt;<i>         will support writing changes such as adding files or modifying
</I>&gt;<i>         the project configuration. Ideally, we should do the same for
</I>&gt;<i>         VS2003 (right now it only supports importing for VS2003
</I>&gt;<i>         projects).
</I>
This is great too.


&gt;<i>       * ASP.NET support: I don't know if this add-in can be mature
</I>&gt;<i>         enough for the 1.0 release. I'll need input on that (which
</I>&gt;<i>         features could we release? would the add-in be really useful for
</I>&gt;<i>         real world web projects?).
</I>
What about creating WebService projects?

&gt;<i>       * GTK# designer: There are several features to be implemented in
</I>&gt;<i>         the designer before the release: 
</I>&gt;<i>               * Support partial classes when generating code. 
</I>&gt;<i>               * Support for Undo/Redo. 
</I>
I like this two too. And what about l10n+stetic?


&gt;<i>       * Version Control: I recently integrated some of the changes done
</I>&gt;<i>         for the Google SoC project and improved it a lot. Support for
</I>&gt;<i>         SVN is mostly functional. What's missing is support for CVS. It
</I>&gt;<i>         would be nice to have for MD 1.0.
</I>
I'm trying this addin these days and I am always getting an exception
with the simplest operation: svn update. Should I file a bug or wait
until more stability?


&gt;<i>       * Welcome page: It looks ok to me.
</I>
What about the patch that was posted some time ago to be able to
localize this addin with Xslt arguments?


&gt;<i>       * Web references: I'd like to integrate the web references add-in
</I>&gt;<i>         implemented by Gideon de Swardt. The only problem I see is that
</I>&gt;<i>         it only supports .NET 2.0 projects. It would be nice to make it
</I>&gt;<i>         work for 1.1 as well.
</I>
I also think this is a must for a 1.0.


&gt;<i>       * Xml editor: It's being maintained outside of MD, so nothing to
</I>&gt;<i>         add. Just to make sure it works when we release 1.0.
</I>
Could it be added to the main release of MD although it's not in SVN?


&gt;<i>       * Autotools: There are several features I'd like to support for MD
</I>&gt;<i>         1.0: 
</I>&gt;<i>               * Support integration with existing Makefiles. That is, if
</I>&gt;<i>                 somebody has a project with complex build rules which
</I>&gt;<i>                 can't be emulated by MD, just make it possible to
</I>&gt;<i>                 delegate the entire build process to Make, and still be
</I>&gt;<i>                 able to launch the build from inside MD. About modifying
</I>&gt;<i>                 the Makefile in MD, I think supporting adding/removing
</I>&gt;<i>                 files would be enough for now. 
</I>&gt;<i>               * We need to find a solution for file templates (.in
</I>&gt;<i>                 files). MD uses some of them. We need to support them in
</I>&gt;<i>                 the MD build model if we want to be able to completely
</I>&gt;<i>                 build MD using MD. 
</I>&gt;<i>               * There may be other missing features needed for
</I>&gt;<i>                 self-hosting MD. 
</I>
I suppose that this last one would be the best to attract contributors
to MD, besides users.

Thanks for all the updated info about MD!

Regards,

	Andr&#233;s	[ knocte ]
