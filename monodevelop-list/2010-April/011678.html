<PRE>Thank you, Piotr!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This year I've decided to take part in Google Summer of Code. I've
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> checked Mono's StudentProjects page and found a note about F# binding.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There was a suggestion to write to mailing list, mhutch or lluis specifically.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First of all you should know that Vasili Glachin has spent a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> time and effort working on an F# binding recently.
</I>&gt;<i> You can find his code here: <A HREF="http://github.com/vasili/FSharpBinding/">http://github.com/vasili/FSharpBinding/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm pretty sure Vasili won't mind somebody helping out, but since a
</I>&gt;<i> GSoC project should be a well defined and measurable unit of work,
</I>&gt;<i> maybe you could work on a specific feature like code completion or the
</I>&gt;<i> refactoring engine? Or both of them depending on how much work is
</I>&gt;<i> involved. Micheal is probably the best person to talk about that.
</I>&gt;<i> One project that would be extremely cool, in opinion of course, is
</I>&gt;<i> getting Stetic to produce F# code for the UI. That would be first ever
</I>&gt;<i> since even VS will not have a graphical designer for F#.
</I>
I've checked github, and found only 1 commit with project system
support only (did not tested it). I will probably use these code, but
currently it is almost ground level. So focusing on UI is impossible
as almost nothing works. I think I need to work on syntax highlighting
and completion support first.

&gt;&gt;<i> Before writting an application I should be aware of the following:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Do you need your own compiler or using existing fsc from Microsoft is ok?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can I use CodeDom library, provided with Microsoft F#?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> These two questions are about licensing. I've also asked in F# forum (
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://cs.hubfs.net/forums/thread/13591.aspx">http://cs.hubfs.net/forums/thread/13591.aspx</A> ), but still have no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> answer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm pretty sure using fsc should be OK, especially if Microsoft keep
</I>&gt;<i> their promise of releasing it under Ms-PL. We should know that soon
</I>&gt;<i> after they release VS2010.
</I>
It seems CodeDom from PowerPack is capable of compilation for ASP.NET only.

&gt;&gt;<i> Can I write binding in F# itself, specifically, is it ok to have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reference to FSharp.Core and FSharp.PowerPack libraries from Microsoft
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> build?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The less external dependencies the better. I would recommend getting
</I>&gt;<i> as far as possible without using any external code.
</I>&gt;<i> Of course if you decide to work on the source code completion or
</I>&gt;<i> refactoring engine, using CodeDom probably be acceptable, especially
</I>&gt;<i> if it is created as an optional feature of the binding.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I've found that PowerPack is published under MS-PL. So it is ok to be used?

P.S. It would be nice to hear a word from any mentors.

Best regards,
Milovanov Victor.
