<PRE>
I am attempting to convert the Windows/NetWare system at my university over
to a system of thin clients connecting to Linux servers via NX remote
desktoping. My proposal has widespread support from the science faculty and
administration. 

Unfortunately, much of my proposal rests on the ability of the students to
be able to recompile their C# code without changes on the Linux systems, as
we will be beta testing the system on first-year computer science students
and the university courses use C#. I want the transition from Visual Studio
to the Linux IDE to be as seamless as possible. Your software is very close
to being up to the task, but is lacking in a few areas, such as its console
and debugging functionality.

Adding functionality such as improving the debugging mechanisms so that they
work with the external console, allowing us to use the external console by
default, and allowing text entry in the internal console (Eclipse allows
this, so I don't see why MonoDevelop would not) would ensure the success of
my proposal, and the adoption of Linux by my university.

I have to add that, if this proposal is successful, every computer science
student at my university, from this point forward, will be trained to use
MonoDevelop and Mono. Although my university is small, this is still 50-100
graduates per year. :p

In the meantime, I will be suggesting my university uses Eclipse with the
Emonic plug-in as their IDE in the short term. However, in the long term, I
would prefer a more complete and integrated solution. An improved
MonoDevelop seems to be the best bet for this task.

Sincerely,
Ryan Oram
