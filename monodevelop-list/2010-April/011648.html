<PRE>Hello MonoDevelopers,

I am planning to participate in this years summer of code. I've already went
through the Mono Student Projects page and the class designer stood out to
me. To me it would be an exciting and challenging project to work on. I took
some time to read the tasks page to figure out what was involved in
undertaking this project.

I know I should run by you before I really start writing my proposal. Do you
have any questions or comments for me? If I was accepted for the project
what is the required deliverable in a little more details? What is expected
of me the student? Is there any minimal skill requirements for this project?

&gt;<i>From what I've seen this project can be broken into 5 main components. If
</I>anything looks incorrect just let me know.

1. Setting up basic addin extending support for cd files, a basic cd file
template and command to launch the designer.
2. Reusable Visual Designer Canvas
3. Hooking up Designer to Code Completion
4. Toolbox Provider
5. Property Provider

If there is any extra time work on adding support for VS class designer
files. After the summer of code I could work on additional functionality.

-- 
All The Best,
Evan
