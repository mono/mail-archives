</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This year I've decided to take part in Google Summer of Code. I've

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> First of all you should know that Vasili Glachin has spent a lot of

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You can find his code here: <A HREF="http://github.com/vasili/FSharpBinding/">http://github.com/vasili/FSharpBinding/</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm pretty sure Vasili won't mind somebody helping out, but since a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> GSoC project should be a well defined and measurable unit of work,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> maybe you could work on a specific feature like code completion or the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> refactoring engine? Or both of them depending on how much work is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> involved. Micheal is probably the best person to talk about that.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One project that would be extremely cool, in opinion of course, is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> getting Stetic to produce F# code for the UI. That would be first ever
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> since even VS will not have a graphical designer for F#.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've checked github, and found only 1 commit with project system
</I>&gt;<i> support only (did not tested it). I will probably use these code, but
</I>&gt;<i> currently it is almost ground level. So focusing on UI is impossible
</I>&gt;<i> as almost nothing works. I think I need to work on syntax highlighting
</I>&gt;<i> and completion support first.
</I>
The GTK GUI designer works for any language that has CodeDOM support
and a couple of refactoring operations: insert member and rename.
These may be viable for SoC.

You should look at some of the past emails on this list where I
replied to Vasili explaining the various parts of a language binding,
and form a plan and objectives from some subset of these, and other
possible useful features such as an fsi REPL pad. At the very least
I'd expect a parser and resolver, which are a prerequisite for code
completion, refactoring, navigation etc. That said, if/when fsc is
open-sourced then its parser and resolver could be used...

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Before writting an application I should be aware of the following:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Do you need your own compiler or using existing fsc from Microsoft is ok?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Can I use CodeDom library, provided with Microsoft F#?
</I>
There is no F/OSS compiler for F# yet, but IIRC Don Syme mentioned
that that MS would be open-sourcing fsc in the future. For now, it can
be downloaded a s zip file from MS and used on Linux and Mac, though I
don't think it can be redistributed, so end users would have to
install it manually. That's fine for now.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> These two questions are about licensing. I've also asked in F# forum (
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://cs.hubfs.net/forums/thread/13591.aspx">http://cs.hubfs.net/forums/thread/13591.aspx</A> ), but still have no
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> answer.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm pretty sure using fsc should be OK, especially if Microsoft keep
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their promise of releasing it under Ms-PL. We should know that soon
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> after they release VS2010.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems CodeDom from PowerPack is capable of compilation for ASP.NET only.
</I>
That might be sufficient for the ASP.NET designer generation, the MD
templates, and the GUI designer. CodeDOM is usually only ever used for
code generation - the CodeDom parser interfaces are very rarely
implemented.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Can I write binding in F# itself, specifically, is it ok to have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> reference to FSharp.Core and FSharp.PowerPack libraries from Microsoft
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> build?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The less external dependencies the better. I would recommend getting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as far as possible without using any external code.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Of course if you decide to work on the source code completion or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> refactoring engine, using CodeDom probably be acceptable, especially
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if it is created as an optional feature of the binding.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've found that PowerPack is published under MS-PL. So it is ok to be used?
</I>
Yes, it's fine to write it in F# and to depend on the Core and
PowerPack libraries. This will of course make it harder to build, but
given that *using* it requires fsc, I don't think a build-time
dependency is a big problem. The other downside is that it will be
harder for the core MD team (and other people who don't yet use F#) to
help maintain it, but the corresponding upside is that F# users will
find it easier to contribute.

&gt;<i> P.S. It would be nice to hear a word from any mentors.
</I>
What do you want to hear? :)
