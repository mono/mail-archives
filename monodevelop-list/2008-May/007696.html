<PRE>Paul,
    
    Regarding your reply to my problem as below:

Paul   

    I have installed monodevelop from debian via apt-get and all works fine 
now.  No idea why I have so many problems compiling from source but as 
it works OK when a package from Debian means I'll stick with this method.

 
Thanks,

Brett Senior

You're right.  I've missed that one earlier, sorry.

</I>
I think all of my above suggestions would improve the search interface
and I respect consistency provided by the HIG, but extracting options
from the combobox is clearly an improvement, since currently it's
impossible to see the mode of this interface element and it's very
confusing this way.

I don't know what section of the HIG tells you not to do that, but as
Federico stated earlier, the HIG should act as guidelines, not rules.

I agree that it would be nice to display contents of the dropdown menu
within the find bar, but we'll run into space problems, even on
1280x1024. There are now three options (one more that last time you
looked, I suspect), and this could well grow (e.g. glob expressions).
Don't forget also that some translations may have longer strings.
Ideally we need a widget that will shunt options into a menu when
there isn't space for them.

Anyhow, the stock Next and Previous icons on my system are left/right.
Maybe we should use icons rather than arrows, but the directions won't
change for most people.

</I>
Yeah, but Firefox has historically had poor HIG compliance, so isn't
perhaps the best model for many things. However, he FF find bar is
generally pretty nice, EXCEPT that they don't handle the case where
the window is too small :)

&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt; * Line numbers and code seems to blend together when folding is

This looks like a colourscheme issues, since it's fine on the &quot;Oblivion&quot; theme.

Yes, please. It helps us keep track of things much better than the
mailing list does.

Hello,

My problem is simple. I can't find how to run my assembly with
arguments inside monodevelop. Where can I set the arguments?

At the moment I have to run my assembly outside monodevelop because my
main method doesn't work without arguments.

Regards,
Artun

Hi,

Project Options &gt; Configurations &gt; {Debug,Release} &gt; Output &gt; Parameters

might do the trick. I didn't try it though.

The new addin for gtk# 2.10 is now available in the following
repository:

<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/md/unstable/1.0.0">http://www.go-mono.com/md/unstable/1.0.0</A>

or if you are running MD from trunk:

<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/md/unstable/trunk">http://www.go-mono.com/md/unstable/trunk</A>

I haven't been able to do a real test because I have gtk# 2.10 in my
system, so please tell me if you find any problem.

Lluis.

When did you get this error? do you have a stack trace?
