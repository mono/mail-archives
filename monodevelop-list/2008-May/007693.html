</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm going to start by explaining the problem, then my solution.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> First the problem. Sometimes it is understandable that in closed source
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shops that use Visual Studio, when only a few developers are working on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it, a reference might be added to a third party assembly that exists on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a shared network drive. In VS, you'd right click on your project and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> choose Add Reference, Browse, navigate to your shared network drive, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> choose the assembly. VS would store the absolute path to the assembly in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the project file, so that other users would attempt to refer to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> assembly from the same location.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In open source code, this is generally a poor idea, for obvious reasons.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Nobody has shared network drives. For closed source internal company
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> code, there is nothing wrong with this. It's perfectly fine, many people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do it, and it works as expected.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another situation might be when you want to add a reference to a library
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> installed on your OS, but which provides no means of dynamic location of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the assembly. Perhaps the assembly is simply installed directly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into /usr/lib. Perhaps it was never really packaged properly to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consumed by others. No pkgconfig files. I personally see nothing wrong
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with this. It would be nice to modify the package so that it installed a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pkgconfig file, no doubt. But you aren't going to convince my small
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> internal IT department to do so. Suggesting that we do is a non-starter.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All of those points considered, MonoDevelop does not allow this to work.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you add a reference to a file in /usr/lib, for instance, MonoDevelop
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stores in it's project file something along the lines of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> '../../../../../../usr/lib/foo/Bar.dll'. This is silly. There is no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expectation that my project file will be in the same place on every
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system, so no expectation that the relative path will be the same. It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> breaks.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So. There are a few possible ways to address this that I see.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a) Advocate that nobody refers to files outside of the solution
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> directory, and anybody who does is doing it Wrong.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't really find this solution practical. You won't convince people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by mandating solutions like this. Additionally, I don't really even have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a ethical problem with references outside my project directory! There is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no consistent definition of Wrong here.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> b) Store absolute paths in the project file when appropriate.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm all for this. If there was a way that would automatically determine
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when a file should be stored absolute. I don't think there is a way. You
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are you sure?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let's say you link to /usr/lib/whatever, in MD that should be a 
</I>&gt;<i> reference to ../../../(n times)/../usr/lib/whatever/.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why not checking iteratively:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) is .. == / ? If yes, it's absolute.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) is ../.. == / ? If yes, it's absolute.
</I>&gt;<i> After n) It's relative.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The only case in which this would fail is that if someone stablishes 
</I>&gt;<i> it's root dir project to /, which is non-sense.
</I>
Hugh, and it would fail also if the project's root dir is in the same 
first-level dir from root as the library, which is maybe not nonsense, 
but totally uncommon...
