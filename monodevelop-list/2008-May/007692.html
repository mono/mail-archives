&gt;<i> Howdy. The last few days I've been working on a patch to MonoDevelop to
</I>&gt;<i> implement a feature I consider pretty important on the Linux/Unix space.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm going to start by explaining the problem, then my solution.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First the problem. Sometimes it is understandable that in closed source
</I>&gt;<i> shops that use Visual Studio, when only a few developers are working on
</I>&gt;<i> it, a reference might be added to a third party assembly that exists on
</I>&gt;<i> a shared network drive. In VS, you'd right click on your project and
</I>&gt;<i> choose Add Reference, Browse, navigate to your shared network drive, and
</I>&gt;<i> choose the assembly. VS would store the absolute path to the assembly in
</I>&gt;<i> the project file, so that other users would attempt to refer to the
</I>&gt;<i> assembly from the same location.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In open source code, this is generally a poor idea, for obvious reasons.
</I>&gt;<i> Nobody has shared network drives. For closed source internal company
</I>&gt;<i> code, there is nothing wrong with this. It's perfectly fine, many people
</I>&gt;<i> do it, and it works as expected.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another situation might be when you want to add a reference to a library
</I>&gt;<i> installed on your OS, but which provides no means of dynamic location of
</I>&gt;<i> the assembly. Perhaps the assembly is simply installed directly
</I>&gt;<i> into /usr/lib. Perhaps it was never really packaged properly to be
</I>&gt;<i> consumed by others. No pkgconfig files. I personally see nothing wrong
</I>&gt;<i> with this. It would be nice to modify the package so that it installed a
</I>&gt;<i> pkgconfig file, no doubt. But you aren't going to convince my small
</I>&gt;<i> internal IT department to do so. Suggesting that we do is a non-starter.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All of those points considered, MonoDevelop does not allow this to work.
</I>&gt;<i> If you add a reference to a file in /usr/lib, for instance, MonoDevelop
</I>&gt;<i> stores in it's project file something along the lines of
</I>&gt;<i> '../../../../../../usr/lib/foo/Bar.dll'. This is silly. There is no
</I>&gt;<i> expectation that my project file will be in the same place on every
</I>&gt;<i> system, so no expectation that the relative path will be the same. It
</I>&gt;<i> breaks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So. There are a few possible ways to address this that I see.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> a) Advocate that nobody refers to files outside of the solution
</I>&gt;<i> directory, and anybody who does is doing it Wrong.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't really find this solution practical. You won't convince people
</I>&gt;<i> by mandating solutions like this. Additionally, I don't really even have
</I>&gt;<i> a ethical problem with references outside my project directory! There is
</I>&gt;<i> no consistent definition of Wrong here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> b) Store absolute paths in the project file when appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm all for this. If there was a way that would automatically determine
</I>&gt;<i> when a file should be stored absolute. I don't think there is a way. You
</I>
Are you sure?

Let's say you link to /usr/lib/whatever, in MD that should be a 
reference to ../../../(n times)/../usr/lib/whatever/.

Why not checking iteratively:
1) is .. == / ? If yes, it's absolute.
2) is ../.. == / ? If yes, it's absolute.
After n) It's relative.

The only case in which this would fail is that if someone stablishes 
it's root dir project to /, which is non-sense.

&gt;<i> can say if it's in a level above the solution file... but I've had
</I>&gt;<i> solution files deep in my source hierarchy before, so that won't work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I want to note that this is not a real problem on Windows. Windows has a
</I>&gt;<i> very obvious way to determine if a path should be absolute or relative:
</I>&gt;<i> a drive or share name. It's obvious. In Unix, with out single root,
</I>&gt;<i> things are less clear.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> c) Allow the user to choose whether the path is absolute or not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the face of it, I don't like asking the user to choose this. But
</I>&gt;<i> after considering the other solutions above, I'm not sure of any other
</I>&gt;<i> choice. For a given reference, simply make it a property whether or not
</I>&gt;<i> the reference is &quot;absolute&quot; or not. User checks or unchecks it. The job
</I>&gt;<i> is done.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm all for c! Being all for c), I wrote it. Attached is a patch that
</I>&gt;<i> implements c).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Currently the Project class defines GetReferencedFileNames, which
</I>&gt;<i> returns as a list of absolute paths to assemblies that should be
</I>&gt;<i> included when compiling the project. I have altered this to
</I>&gt;<i> GetReferencedFiles which return type ProjectDeployFile.
</I>&gt;<i> ProjectDeployFile is a new type that contains both an absolute path, and
</I>&gt;<i> an indicator on whether or not the path should be persisted absolute.
</I>&gt;<i> This allows components, such as the Autotools generator, to refer to the
</I>&gt;<i> path, and also make a decision about whether or not to convert it to
</I>&gt;<i> relative when storing it in a Makefile.am.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think ProjectDeployFile should be renamed, to something like
</I>&gt;<i> ProjectReferenceFile, or ProjectFileReference... but both of these
</I>&gt;<i> conflict semantically with existing names, so I left it what it is. Feel
</I>&gt;<i> free to change it or suggest alternatives.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The ProjectReference class has grown a property AbsolutePath, which
</I>&gt;<i> indicates whether an absolute path should be used. This property is not
</I>&gt;<i> serialized to the project file. It's inferred based on the content of
</I>&gt;<i> the project file. If the project file contains /Foo, then it is
</I>&gt;<i> absolute. If it contains Foo, or ../Foo, then it is not. The getter and
</I>&gt;<i> setter for this property alter the actual stored reference itself. I
</I>&gt;<i> think this is perfectly intuitive, and it does not alter the project
</I>&gt;<i> file definition any.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Autotools generator has been modified to make use of the information
</I>&gt;<i> on DeployFile to decide whether to store an absolute path to a relative
</I>&gt;<i> path in the generated Makefiles.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I changed all code I could find that used GetReferencedFileNames.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please review the patch, and offer any comments. I've already talked
</I>&gt;<i> with a few people... many of whom were pro, after my rationalization,
</I>&gt;<i> and some who were con for reason a). I'd hope any discussion persuades
</I>&gt;<i> the dissenters to change their mind.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your time.
</I>&gt;<i>
