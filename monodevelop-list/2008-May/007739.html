<PRE>
Thanks for your answers guys. I was a bit concerned before because in my 
previous job we used the solution folders feature of VS but I was never 
totally convinced about its advantages. Furthermore we ended stablishing 
the rule of making solution folders coincide with physical folders, 
because otherwise the solution would become a mess, and anyway there was 
no automatic method for checking this, so sometimes it became a mess 
when somebody didn't respect the rule. (So I ended thinking that nested 
solutions was the *solution* to this problem, but now I see your point 
about external references that are not in the GAC.)

I'm wondering if a feature like this (to force solution folders be 
physical folders) would be welcomed in MD (haven't tried yet SVN so, 
sorry if this is actually the way it works).

Regards,

	Andres
