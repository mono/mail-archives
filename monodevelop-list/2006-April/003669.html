</I>&gt;<i> Lluis, how would this fit in with Stetic? Is this an approach you'd be

</I>
So, there are two goals here: one is avoid having one toolbox pad and
one property grid pad for each component model used by MonoDevelop
(Stetic, ASP.NET, UML, etc). The other goal is to provide a generic way
of editing properties for any object of the IDE (projects, solutions,
files, etc).

For the first goal: I think we can implement in MD a toolbox generic
enough to be useful for ASP.NET, Stetic or any other designer. I don't
see a big problem here. The property grid is a more complex subject,
since different component models may have very different needs. The most
simple solution here is to provide a way of setting the property grid
widget to be shown in the properties pad. When a component is selected
in a designer, the designer just will need to make sure to display its
own property grid in the pad.

About the second goal, we need to define a component model to use, and
an API for setting the currently selected object. I think it is not
necessary to create a new component model for this, since
System.ComponentModel would be enough for editing arbitrary objects.
Maybe something like this:

class PropertyGridPad
{
	// To be used by different component models
	void SetPropertyGridWidget (Gtk.Widget w);

	// To be used by System.ComponentModel users
	void ShowComponentProperties (object obj);
}


&gt;<i> I'm going to be applying for the Google SoC this year
</I>&gt;<i> with a view to properly integrating AspNetEdit into MonoDevelop, and I
</I>&gt;<i> would really like to be able to share some designer infrastructure.
</I>
That would be awesome!

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IMHO we'll never have databinding support as for MWF or ASP.Net in Gtk#
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because of this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I heard it would become a priority after finishing MWF. It doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily have to work the same way; there are better databinding
</I>&gt;<i> models out there.
