<PRE>Aha, yes thats very interestening. I didn't work with dialogs yet in Gtk.
But how can it be combined with glade?
My solution when using windows and glade looks like this:

public class Window1: IDisposable
{
	public delegate void WCallbackHandler(int args);
	public event WCallbackHandler OnStatusChanged;
	
	public Window1(...)
	{
		Glade.XML gxml = new Glade.XML (null, &quot;window1.glade&quot;, null, null);
		gxml.Autoconnect(this);
		...

This adds the created window object to the runnng app but connects 
handler-methods of the window to class-internal methods. To see when the 
window is done (or closed) I publish an event that must be subscribed to from
the main window.
		
regards,
Christoph G.
