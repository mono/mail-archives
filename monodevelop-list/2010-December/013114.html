Yeah I tend to agree with you as well.  I've tried using the MDI mode
in VS a few times over the years because it has some advantages in
theory, but I can never really get used to it and always end up
switching back to tabs.

The original ask was &quot;I want to see multiple files at the same time&quot;,
so I guess as long as this is done, the exact implementation is up to
the MonoDevelop guys..  I've never seen the way Eclipse does it, but I
believe I have that installed (as well as XCode) so maybe I'll mess
around with that later..
