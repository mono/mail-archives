<PRE>Thanks for the quick reply.

Too much code!

Great, that might be a workaround: open then immediately save.

&gt;<i> but I think I had to argue
</I>&gt;<i> for the latter to be added. Some people thought that it was bad behaviour
</I>&gt;<i> because it meant that code changed in ways that they might not see (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> closing with unsaved changes and hitting &quot;save&quot; when prompted), but I wanted

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Code changing in unseen ways would be bad, I agree, but formatting and
whitespace are for humans, not compilers. It is no more code than are
comments. Debatable, I know (it would be annoying to recompile due to
a &quot;change&quot; that is only whitespace) but that's my stand on it.

&gt;<i> Different indentation preferences in terms of how many spaces a tab is
</I>&gt;<i> should be supported, but anything for the other formatting options needs an
</I>&gt;<i> action to make it happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
An action, such as?

&gt;<i> Normalising on commit is an interesting idea, though. Every project I've
</I>&gt;<i> worked on just goes for &quot;all code must be formatted like this, which we'll
</I>&gt;<i> do by having people use the same format rules&quot;. Generally it doesn't cause
</I>&gt;<i> much of a problem. We've said in the team that saving some abstract model of
</I>&gt;<i> the code (like the compile tree) and formatting the code as the developer
</I>&gt;<i> wants would solve all of these &quot;whitespace and formatting changes&quot; commits,
</I>&gt;<i> but no-one seems to do it at the moment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I see.

&gt;<i> I'm not sure why you wouldn't be able to build C# in Kubuntu, though. As
</I>&gt;<i> long as you've got MD and all of the appropriate Mono dependencies then you
</I>&gt;<i> should be able to build in KDE. There's something really wrong if you can't,
</I>&gt;<i> what with MonoDevelop building code on Windows and Mac as well these days!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
C# in the mono implementation builds on Kubuntu, but not Visual C#. C#
is the standard, the two big implementations of the standard are
Visual C# and Mono. I am working with Visual C# code.
