</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I could be wrong, but isn't MDI an oddity to Windows? Personally, I hate

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and so don't use it in any way. Everyone else tends to go for tabs (ala

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> The original ask was &quot;I want to see multiple files at the same time&quot;,

</I>
If you're familiar with VS then Eclipse basically does the same thing,
but with pure tabs (i.e. everything is consistent in appearance), with
more obvious grouping (i.e. when you auto-hide a group then it is boxed
together), with a maximise option for groups, and with a generally more
obvious UI in terms of &quot;things that apply to the current tab/view&quot;
versus &quot;things that apply to the group&quot;. I generally prefer its
mechanism for telling you where things will be placed - it somehow seems
more sensible (big hit area for merging tabs into one area and less
clutter).
