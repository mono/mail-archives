</I>
I found that the debuginfo was only for the native buts, because I 
installed that before, but the .cs files are in the debugsource package 
(I checked after I installed and it didn't work).

Just so that I know what I'm trying to achieve, what files do I need to 
have where and what other variables/bindings/settings are needed? In 
Eclipse with Java I just need to associate a zip of .java files to a JAR 
or install the jdk-src package, which is really easy and flexible. I'm 
not entirely clear on what Mono needs to have where at the moment, and 
it'd be a shame if it wasn't easy to do with a standard install.

Thanks,

IBBoard
