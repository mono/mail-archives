<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> You need to run 'make clean all' from the root MD checkout.
</I>
The report came from a completely clean checkout and build. Had it been
from a build on my test box which is constantly updated, I'd of tried
that first.

&gt;<i> As an aside Paul, please please in the future try a make clean all and
</I>&gt;<i> other standard building techniques before reporting obvious issues as
</I>&gt;<i> problems. 
</I>
I did - though in this case make clean all was not required as it was
from a completely clean checkout.

&gt;<i> I see you do this consistently on various lists. And for
</I>&gt;<i> someone who has a webpage about how to build mono, your basic inability
</I>&gt;<i> to understand the build process astounds me.
</I>
Come on now. I usually go through all sort before reporting a fault and
even then I try to ensure it's not something I can avoid by wiping the
sources and rebuilding from scratch. I understand the build process well
- I should do, I've been developing code for long enough under various
operating systems.

I could take issue at the aside being put on the general list, but hey,
I'm bigger than that and appreciate a reply.

TTFN

Paul
