<PRE>Hi,
 
As I am dying to one day be able to use the debugger in Monodevelop I
try from time to time to enable it in the configure. It seems that it
the code is always lagging behind the Mono.Debugger assembly so my
guess is that the developers do not necessarily work at SVN head for
the main mono stuff.
 
I decided to take matters in my own hands. I am as far as getting the
code to compile but have reached a dead end now. I can't figure out
how to create the DebuggerBackend as it is currently internal to the
Mono.Debugger assembly and protection level compile errors occur.
 
Will someone in the know please take a look at this patch and maybe
take it the last mile (or tell me that I'm heading the wrong way if
that's the case).
 
Thanks,
 
Jacques Beaurain
