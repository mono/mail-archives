<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Thats fine. Did you make uninstall first?
</I>
No. I didn't have it on my machine to start with.

&gt;<i> Here is my guess as to the series of events.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Paul has a copy of MD installed, and that copy of MD was built with
</I>&gt;<i> the Boo binding.
</I>
Nope, which then follows that the rest of the guesses aren't right.
Please, give me at least *some* credit of knowing the way to do things.

&gt;<i> 6) Paul and Todd engage in a mini-flame war because Todd is a giant
</I>&gt;<i> asshole, who generally can't stand pointless questions by people who
</I>&gt;<i> seem to tell other people how to do things they are incapable of doing
</I>&gt;<i> themselves (general case of knowing your own, etc), as well as being
</I>&gt;<i> mildly irritated by the expression &quot;TTFN&quot; :).
</I>
Okay, take a couple of deep breaths now. There. That's better. I have
never said anyone here is an asshole of any size, shape or description.
The question was not pointless. I didn't have MD on my machine, it was a
fresh checkout, I did try quite a number of ways to get the software to
run, found I couldn't, posted the report and then get this. Seems quite
reasonable to me.

As for TTFN, I've used it now for approaching 5 years and I ain't gonna
be changing it any time soon.

TTFN

Paul
