<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I would if I felt it was apropos. But your emails to other lists
</I>&gt;<i> confusing such basic libraries as glib and glibc proves it really can't
</I>&gt;<i> be. But that is neither here nor there.
</I>
&quot;Everyone makes mistakes&quot; - as the Dalek said, climbing off the
dustbin ;-)

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 6) Paul and Todd engage in a mini-flame war because Todd is a giant
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; asshole, who generally can't stand pointless questions by people who
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; seem to tell other people how to do things they are incapable of doing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; themselves (general case of knowing your own, etc), as well as being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; mildly irritated by the expression &quot;TTFN&quot; :).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Okay, take a couple of deep breaths now. There. That's better. I have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; never said anyone here is an asshole of any size, shape or description.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The question was not pointless. I didn't have MD on my machine, it was a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fresh checkout, I did try quite a number of ways to get the software to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; run, found I couldn't, posted the report and then get this. Seems quite
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reasonable to me.
</I>
&gt;<i> I clearly said I was an asshole, and I never intimated anything about
</I>&gt;<i> how you feel.
</I>
This is part of the problem - by the way I read it (without coffee in
me!), the inference was that I thought you are an oversized asshole. As
it's not, then it'd doesn't really matter.

&gt;<i> Anyway, to workaround it for now, if you remove the BooBinding dll and
</I>&gt;<i> addin.xml file, it will no longer attempt to load it, and that should
</I>&gt;<i> remove the issues. Of course, you don't get the Boo binding, but as I
</I>&gt;<i> said above, no clue as to why that is occurring.
</I>
I'll give it a shot and if it works, I'll buy you a pint when you're
next in Manchester.

&gt;<i> &gt; As for TTFN, I've used it now for approaching 5 years and I ain't gonna
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be changing it any time soon. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Awesome. That means I get to make fun of it for a while to come. Thanks!
</I>
Hours of fun await!

TTFN

Paul
