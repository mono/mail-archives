Absolutely understood.

I could be wrong (strike that, probably wrong) but my understanding (and
lluis can explain better) is that it:

1) Easily allows for extensions, like if someone wanted to extend the
file-pad to show external servers over sftp or something, or add a new
right click menu option, etc.

2) Handles all of the lovely lazyloading for you. So a lot less code
duplication

3) Hooks easily into our Command structure, that would allow you to
redirect commands (Like cut, copy, or whatever) to your pad if it has
focus, and do the right thing.


Those are the 3 bigthings, there are prolly more, but in general it is
pretty cool, and people that have used it seem to enjoy it.
