I would if I felt it was apropos. But your emails to other lists
confusing such basic libraries as glib and glibc proves it really can't
be. But that is neither here nor there.

I am out of ideas then, it really does seem like you have a broken build
somehow, and since it builds fine for others, I am not sure. It might
have to do with Lluis' layout changes, and if it does, then you are on
your own, because his email pretty clearly said to wait until the end of
the week for the entire set of changes to settle into place. I surely
wouldn't have updated/checked out a copy of SVN during the days he said
not to.

</I>

Wow. Uh.

I clearly said I was an asshole, and I never intimated anything about
how you feel. I couldn't care either way if you think I am or not, I
know that I am.

Anyway, to workaround it for now, if you remove the BooBinding dll and
addin.xml file, it will no longer attempt to load it, and that should
remove the issues. Of course, you don't get the Boo binding, but as I
said above, no clue as to why that is occurring.

Awesome. That means I get to make fun of it for a while to come. Thanks!
