<PRE>There is an issue with MD that results in the attached error message. 
This file has not been changed outsite MD. This has happened many times 
but afraid I can't get a handle of when it does/does not happen. On a 
few cases it has resulted in the *.cs file in quesion been wiped 
completly blank when has necessiated reverting to earlier backups. It is 
more likely to happen if I have a large number of cs files open and I 
click save all and then I may get this error a couple of times.

My version is from svn yesterday but this has been an issue for the past 
couple of months.

Pat.
