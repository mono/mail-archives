This (and some others) is a new file that had not been added to the 
project files yet.  I added it earlier today and my guess is that 
anonymous svn is slightly behind. This is what I meant by being out of sync.

The bugs/incomplete things I currently know of are:
 - keeping the project files in sync with the makefiles
 - copying the .addin.xml files to right place (and probably some other 
helper files)
(Note their is a low-tech solution of placing these miscellaneous files 
at their target locations, but I think this is a workaround for missing 
functionality)
 - changing localonly property from the ui
 - dealing with Gtk# 2.0, 2.4, 2.6, and 2.8 versions from one file
 - adding project files for the rest of the addins

I think that the project files are at the point where more people could 
use/test them and begin to work through these issues.  Those looking for 
a more reliable/easier build probably should not use them at this point.
