<PRE>I would love if it also would come sorted both on name AND version, as
it is common to have both versions of GTK# libs in the GAC, in some
cases for same-named libs the 1.0 version comes first but for some
others the 2.X comes first, this complicates doing multiple selection.

Also how about selecting packages (that would imply referencing
multiple assemblies): I think another tab (Packages) in that dialog
with a list of packages (a bit clunky on how to filter only the
managed ones from what pkg-config gives) is the easy part, but how
would end up the model for the project and how it would be viewed in
the project tree? For example we could have a separate Referecend
Packages folder, or have packages as nodes on References with or
without assembly nodes inside them. For the benefit of compilers that
doesn't implement -pkg: we could do package expansion on the command
line for them.

Well I babbling too much, but would like to hear from you all and see
things becoming even better.

Fun
