<PRE>Hi.

I think it would be a very nice feature to have. It is a bit
cumbersome to enabled addins in current MD.

And a few comments:

&quot;Enabling/disabling of addins would require restarting MD. Doing it on
the fly would be really hard to implement with the current design&quot;:

It would be cool if we could do it though. Maybe we could do it for
some of the addins while others might require restarting MD.

&quot;We need a way of specifying the dependencies of an addin in a
declarative way.&quot;:

Why would we need that? Can we just not examine the assembly as it is
to determine the dependencies. Also we might just try and instantiate
it inside a try/catch or are things not that simple?

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One of the good things of MD addins is that in most of cases they can be
</I>&gt;<i> implemented in fully managed code, which means that the same binary can
</I>&gt;<i> be safely distributed to any platform that runs MD. I'm writing here
</I>&gt;<i> some ideas about how could we take advantage of this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From the user's point of view, I envision the following features:
</I>&gt;<i>       * A dialog shows a list of addins installed in MD.
</I>&gt;<i>       * The addins can be enabled / disabled.
</I>&gt;<i>       * When the user enables an addin, MD checks that the dependencies
</I>&gt;<i>         of that addin are installed in the system, and shows an error
</I>&gt;<i>         message if they are not.
</I>&gt;<i>       * Addins can be downloaded from internet. There is a list of
</I>&gt;<i>         addins which are available for download. The list is taken from
</I>&gt;<i>         a repository of addins. The user can register new repositories
</I>&gt;<i>         by just adding new urls.
</I>&gt;<i>       * Addins downloaded from internet can be easily updated when a new
</I>&gt;<i>         version is published.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now some technical notes:
</I>&gt;<i>       * Enabling/disabling of addins would require restarting MD. Doing
</I>&gt;<i>         it on the fly would be really hard to implement with the current
</I>&gt;<i>         design.
</I>&gt;<i>       * We need a way of specifying the dependencies of an addin in a
</I>&gt;<i>         declarative way.
</I>&gt;<i>       * An addin may depend on other addins.
</I>&gt;<i>       * Because of the previous point, MD should take care of making
</I>&gt;<i>         sure that addins can find the addin assemblies they depend upon.
</I>&gt;<i>       * Some addins will have uncommon unmanaged dependencies, which
</I>&gt;<i>         will need to be installed by using whatever system it's Linux
</I>&gt;<i>         distribution is based on. This new addin management system would
</I>&gt;<i>         not be so useful in this case, but I think that there are many
</I>&gt;<i>         other cases in which it would be really useful.
</I>&gt;<i>       * If an addin only has managed dependencies (for example, the boo
</I>&gt;<i>         compiler), an option would be to package those dependencies
</I>&gt;<i>         together with the addin.
</I>&gt;<i>       * A repository of addins could be something as simple as an XML
</I>&gt;<i>         file with the list of addins (and its dependencies and versions)
</I>&gt;<i>         together with gziped assemblies.
</I>&gt;<i>       * There would be an &quot;official&quot; MD repository of addins, with the
</I>&gt;<i>         optional addins we are not currently shipping.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any comment about this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, I don't think I'm going to implement this at short term, so if
</I>&gt;<i> people agree that something like this is needed and somebody has some
</I>&gt;<i> free time, feel free to take it, it shouldn't be too difficult to do,
</I>&gt;<i> and looks like fun ;-)
