What about: 

MonoDevelop.IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironment

I know it is long but certainly the class name is seldom used/typed,
and the using clauses for the namespace are normally 'autocompleted',
It is the kind of name my classes and methods get as I deem
clarity/precision as much more important than source file size (look
at Mono.GetOptions sources to verify that).

Your definition for IdeApplication was worded as

&gt;<i> &gt;               * The Ide class: a root class for accessing all IDE
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                 services (like we have Runtime for the core services).
</I>
And I think my long suggestion fits the &quot;root class&quot; concept well.
Also IdeApplication , in truth, didn't convey the &quot;access to IDE
services&quot; part so well, it kind of looked like an standalone/closed
object.

The derived namespaces would have to be adjusted as well

     * MonoDevelop.IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironment.Gui
     * MonoDevelop.IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironment.Gui.Pads
     * MonoDevelop.IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironment.Gui.Search
     * MonoDevelop.IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironment.Commands
     * MonoDevelop.IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironment.Services

Obviously there is the short form

MonoDevelop.IDE (I would abandon the norm of 'proper-casing' even
acronyms, for this case, as it brings enhanced recognizability for any
user of a modern IDE).

But I still prefer the longer form, just that no confusion with the
hardware meaning of IDE (Integrated/Intelligent Drive Electronics) can
take place, ever.
