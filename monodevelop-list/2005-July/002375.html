<PRE>Just to reply to my thoughts to the issues jluke brought up:

Not sure how to handle this. @ work we generate project files from the
Makefile.am as part of the make process. So you still have to do a make,
and you have to do one any time you want to add a new file, but at least
they stay up to date automagically.

I could prolly import our solution for doing this into the repository,
but would have to check w/ people @ work first, if this is the direction
we want to go.

The other option is to write an IFileFormat for our Makefile.am's and
have it just work. This is most likely preferred.

However, I think the other items below need to be fixed first.

&gt;<i>  - copying the .addin.xml files to right place (and probably some other 
</I>&gt;<i> helper files)
</I>
We need just-assembly plugins. This is something we will be working on,
so the .addin.xml, icons, and templates can just be part of the
assembly.

&gt;<i> (Note their is a low-tech solution of placing these miscellaneous files 
</I>&gt;<i> at their target locations, but I think this is a workaround for missing 
</I>&gt;<i> functionality)
</I>&gt;<i>  - changing localonly property from the ui
</I>&gt;<i>  - dealing with Gtk# 2.0, 2.4, 2.6, and 2.8 versions from one file
</I>
This will be fixed w/ publisher policies upstream, and some tweaks here.
We will have to respect the version of the project file when we load it,
and not blast it w/ the version available in the users GAC.
