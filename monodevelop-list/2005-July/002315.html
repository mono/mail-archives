<PRE>Hi there.

Thanks for your response and offer.

Basically, I wanted to start hacking on the libraries and add support 
for CVS later on. The UML diagrams are supposed to support, if I may use 
your term :-) , &quot;library hackers&quot; in future maintenance of it.

By the way: Do you still actively maintain VersionControl? I wouldn't 
want to get in your way or so. I slipped into it by the Google &quot;Summer 
of Code&quot; program. (Project proposal was &quot;SVN integration in MD&quot;. I got 
rejected, still liked the idea and now I populate the 'net with UML...)

Back on the UML diagram track. Actually, I wanted to have two or three 
levels of UML diagrams.

The one I'm currently working at is a general view from ... hmmm... I 
guess 1 to 5 km over ground :-)
Its purpose is plainly to help associate class names (and the implied 
responsibilities) to certain domains (projects / files).

The next step for me would have been to go to what you called the 
&quot;middle level&quot; and diagram how SubversionVersionControl works.

I am not sure, if there would be any reason to model the low level. I 
mean it is well documented in a notation, commonly known as C# ;-)

So, errm, just drop me a line or two, what you think.

Best regards,

DJ

</I>&gt;<i> don't really need to know about the others.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the middle level is SubversionVersionControl, the implementation of 
</I>&gt;<i> VersionControlSystem for Subversion.  Only library hackers should ever

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the lowest level there is the SvnClient class that very simply

</I>&gt;<i> principle, no one should ever use this class (and the classes defined 
</I>&gt;<i> in it) because it's merely there to support the middle level.  Again, 
</I>&gt;<i> the only people that need to know about the class are library hackers 
</I>&gt;<i> specifically working on improving Subversion support.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, my suggestion would be to not UML all of the classes together.
