<PRE>Hi all!
 
&gt;<i> Yes I'm writting a free IDE. It's dual licensed (GNU and comercial) like a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of other great products (myxaml , ezPublisher..) , the thing is :
</I>&gt;<i> (extracted from SDE website)
</I>
Dual Licensing is possible if you have a copyright assignment by the 
originators of the code - the snippets Mike posted obivously were not 
assigned over to you - see what Fatih stated, according to Mike.
And in all fairness to the original developers - their statements of 
copyright should be left intact even in GPL software. 'Standing on 
the shoulders of giants' - to quote Sir Isaac Newton - does not mean 
you should forget about mentioning those shoulders.
After all, 'Free Software' does not stand for 'free for the taking'.

&gt;<i> Sand SDE software is 100% GPL (General Public License).  If your software is
</I>&gt;<i> also 100% GPL compliant, then you have no obligation to pay for the
</I>&gt;<i> licenses.  For further information on the GNU GPL, click here.
</I>&gt;<i> Please note the following restrictions.  If these do not suit your needs,
</I>&gt;<i> you should consider a commercial license.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   a.. Sand SDE is free use for those who are 100% GPL.  If your application
</I>&gt;<i> is licensed under GPL, you are free to ship any GPL software of Sand SDE
</I>&gt;<i> with your application.
</I>&gt;<i>   b.. Under the Open Source License, you must release the complete source
</I>&gt;<i> code for the application that is built on Sand SDE, excluding the source
</I>&gt;<i> code for operating system components that are usually installed on the
</I>&gt;<i> computer on which the application will be installed.
</I>&gt;<i>   c.. As long as you do not distribute your application, you are free to use
</I>&gt;<i> Sand SDE regardless of whether your application is GPL or not.  Basically,
</I>&gt;<i> the rule is, you can't distribute it unless 1) it's open source, or 2) you
</I>&gt;<i> obtain a commercial license from Sand SDE.
</I>&gt;<i>   d.. You are allowed to modify Sand SDE source code any way you like as
</I>&gt;<i> long as the distributed derivative work is licensed under the GPL as well.
</I>&gt;<i>   e.. You are allowed to copy Sand SDE binaries and source code, but when
</I>&gt;<i> you do so, the copies will fall under the GPL license.
</I>&gt;<i> The rule is every body can use this product for free but companies must pay
</I>&gt;<i> a small fee if they are going to earn money with it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I do not want to sound like the 'GPL police', but proper attribution 
should be honored.
I hope that this has now clarified my attitude towards these things.
Regards,

                  Bernhard Spuida
