Correct.

Strange. I support Open Source and I'm not anti-Micrsoft. I can be
anti-&quot;Microsoft Ways&quot;, but never anti the company itself.

(...split...)

Let's be honest, the problem here is that many companies, and many other
programmers around the world don't know what OpenSource really is and
many
of them are trying to make a business using OpenSource buzzwords to
deliver
something that is not open source.

Another problem, is that those persons think that is *fair* to take GPL
code
(supposed to give freedom to ALL), make some changes and them publish it
under a commercial license. This is *possible* if you ask permission to
the
copyright owners. On the other hand they think that is *unfair* to
publish
those changes under GPL... Basicaly they want to earn money using
somebody
else code, but don't want others to earn money using their code.

It's a bit like a paradox. If human race wouldn't be so naive, the world
would
be a better place!
