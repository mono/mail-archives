<PRE>Who said I was angry.  It is the #Develop guys not giving their 
customers the highest value add. And it is their choice which means that 
their choice is the right way to go.  That is how it is supposed to be. 
  I am honestly impressed with what they have done and hoped we could 
give developes an end to end free development solution but they did not 
see it that way.

Microsoft also has this choice and uses it just the same which is ok 
becuase they own the markets..  Life is just a bit ironic.  And don't 
kid yourself man.  Unix and Linux people hate Microsoft.  If you argue 
with that, you are an idiot.

The point of open source is so that a huge community of programmers can 
commonly work towards the goal of an alternative platform that is NOT 
Microsoft.

If it was not Microsoft, it would be some other EVIL company.  And the 
really funny part is Red Hat and all of these other companies making 
money off a bunch of really sharp kids that can code real well.  That is 
the funniest part, they trade another evil company they helped build for 
free via their hours of effort on code other companies are going to 
sell.  Eventually, they will figure it out when they have to feed their 
families like some of us have to.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Hi all,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>First of all Monodevelop is an amaizing product , the monodevelop 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>community is doing a great job!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>SDE (our ide) at <A HREF="http://sde.esand.net/.">http://sde.esand.net/.</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>More than a product by itself SDE is a framework to create complex 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>development environments. This product was born to solve our own 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>internal interface needs .Our intention was to focus our effors 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>creating 'editing based products' (like metadata editors , software 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>modeling tools , designers , etc..)  and reuse and IDE like evironment
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>.It was designed with extensibility in mind and thus relies on 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>plug-ins and compiler bindings more or less like MonoDevelop . The 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>product has grown and now be have decided to relase under GNU.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>It would be greate to share efforts and perhaps we can continue to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>have a discussion on our two projects and share information and ideas.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
