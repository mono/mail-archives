<PRE>Some final things about this code copyright business.  The only way to 
really copyright your code is to not ship it.  These #Develop guys are 
doing the same things to my company that that Microsoft does to other 
vendors.  I find that very ironic since this whole open source bs is 
anti Microsoft.

If I were you trying to write an IDE, use their code all you want as 
reference but write your own product.  In other words, reference their 
code to figure out how to do something, but write all of your own code. 
  The code quality of that code could be improved quite a bit anyway.

And this is not to say their tool is not awesome.  Just pointing out 
some ironies of this source code business.  I asked the #develop guys if 
I could offer our bug tracking wares for free to help developers out. 
But since we are not open source they were not interested.  This is what 
Microsoft does when they leverage their operating systems.

Kind of funny.

Last but not least, sell your IDE and don't make it open source for 
Linux. If you get it close to the VS.NET level, I would be one of your 
customers in  a second.

Thanks,
Allan
