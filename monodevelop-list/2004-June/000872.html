<PRE>Yeah i am aware, I used to work on Visual C++ in Redmond.  I was part of 
that team years ago.  I do agree that the mono guys are amazing.  I have 
been super impressed.  It is not mono that is messed up.  It is still 
the ease of use of Linux.  On the Microsoft side they do everything for 
you and you can lead into more advanced useage as you get betterof their 
OS.  On Linux everything is still difficult, and you have to just know 
everything.  Now Linux has come a long way and I do understand why 
Redmond is  a bit scrared.  Linux is right on the cusp of greatness.

I am very excited about the mono project and the IDEs that are being 
built.  Heck that is why I am frustrated.  I am really wanting to get 
into development on Linux with .NET. .

One more thought ... On windows they are contiually pushing to build 
tools that make developers way more productive.  Coming from an 
assembly, then C, then C++, then Java, then C# on both Unix and Wndows 
background in the past decade I have seen a lot of trends.  I was 
throwing this criticism out becuase every little time a developer has to 
figure something out or do something manual, they are wasting time. 
This wasted time turns into costs in develop.  Finally when you evaluate 
LInux against windows, you have to go with Windows now for TCO.  All 
that bs they right about is just bs on TCO.  The truth is, ask someone 
lik eme who loves both but has to make business decisions based on teh 
bottom line.  You still end up realizing that the guys in Redmon give 
you the highest value proposition for MOST systems now.  Mono and Sharp 
Develop will end up being the most critical projects in allowing Linux 
to compete with Windows.  You would think 4 - 5  guys would need to be 
100.


Oh well... back to linux configuration pain

Thanks,
Allan
