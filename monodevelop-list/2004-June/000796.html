<PRE>Is anyone workin on a NUnit integration? I saw in the AddIn tutorial =
that there was one started. I work a lot with NUnit and it would be very =
nice to have it incorporated into MD.
=20
Something like having a NUnit Project, add the files with the tests to =
the project, compile, and when pressing Run would pop up a new tab with =
visual indication of the test status.
=20
It could even be a special key for this. In all of my projects (read =
Combines), I have some projects and 1 project with the tests. It would =
be nice to be working on my non test code, in my projects to be tested, =
and by ppressing some key (F6?) MonoDevelop would compile the current =
project, compile the nunit project (if needed), and pop up the tab.
=20
What do you think about this? I read the SharpDevelop's =
PlatformArquitecture.pdf and I have tought to create this AddIn. However =
I can't find more deep documentation about this. Are there any other =
documents? I wanted to play with AddIns to play around with gtk#, witch =
I never used. This way maybe I could do something usefull.
