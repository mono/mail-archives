<PRE>&gt;<i>  I am honestly impressed with what they have done and hoped we could 
</I>&gt;<i> give developes an end to end free development solution but they did not 
</I>&gt;<i> see it that way.
</I>
Maybe they want a &quot;Libre&quot; (free as in speech) end to end solution ? And
not only a free as in beer one ?

&gt;<i> And don't 
</I>&gt;<i> kid yourself man.  Unix and Linux people hate Microsoft.  If you argue 
</I>&gt;<i> with that, you are an idiot.
</I>
OK, like the one you are answering i'm an idiot :D

I have read they hate Microsoft,
they are Unix and Linux people,
so all Unix and Linux people hate MSFT.

Dogs are mortal,
socrate is mortal,
so socrate is a dog.

&gt;<i> If it was not Microsoft, it would be some other EVIL company.  And the 
</I>&gt;<i> really funny part is Red Hat and all of these other companies making 
</I>&gt;<i> money off a bunch of really sharp kids that can code real well.  That is 
</I>&gt;<i> the funniest part, they trade another evil company they helped build for 
</I>&gt;<i> free via their hours of effort on code other companies are going to 
</I>&gt;<i> sell.
</I>
Red Hat sell services (Support, documentations, esay to use packaging,
certifications like oracle one), any economic student could say you that
if they was only selling free (as in speech) softwares they will have
problems as the product is aviable for free (as in beer) on the market.
