<PRE>Hi all,

First of all Monodevelop is an amaizing product , the monodevelop community
is doing a great job!

I write to let you know that I have started a new .net based open source IDE
inspired by VS/Eclipse. you can fine more information about SDE (our ide) at
<A HREF="http://sde.esand.net/.">http://sde.esand.net/.</A>

More than a product by itself SDE is a framework to create complex
development environments. This product was born to solve our own internal
interface needs .Our intention was to focus our effors creating 'editing
based products' (like metadata editors , software modeling tools , designers
, etc..)  and reuse and IDE like evironment .It was designed with
extensibility in mind and thus relies on plug-ins and compiler bindings more
or less like MonoDevelop . The product has grown and now be have decided to
relase under GNU.

It would be greate to share efforts and perhaps we can continue to have a
discussion on our two projects and share information and ideas.

Thanks!
