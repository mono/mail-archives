<PRE>&gt;<i> I asked the #develop guys if
</I>&gt;<i> I could offer our bug tracking wares for free to help developers out.
</I>&gt;<i> But since we are not open source they were not interested.
</I>
I'm not from #D or MonoDevelop teams or even from Mono team, just a
&quot;simple&quot; dev.

But i think that there is the point you haven't seen, #D is NOT ONLY
open sourced it's free software (free as in speech, or in the french
word &quot;libre&quot;).

The goal of Free Software is that customer once they aquired the product
could do nearly anything with it, understanding it, selling it, using
part of his code, as long as they allow their customers to do the same.
If #D ship with your code, users won't be able to modify your soft and
use it freely.

For the anti-microsoft thing i will only said that most of open-source
people are against some of MSFT ways to do business... No hate against
them (If all people hated MSFT, there will be no Mono project at all)
