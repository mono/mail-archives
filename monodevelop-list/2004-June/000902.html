&gt;<i> Hi all!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes I'm writting a free IDE. It's dual licensed (GNU and comercial) like
</I>a
&gt;<i> &gt; lot of other great products (myxaml , ezPublisher..) , the thing is :
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (extracted from SDE website)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dual Licensing is possible if you have a copyright assignment by the
</I>&gt;<i> originators of the code - the snippets Mike posted obivously were not
</I>&gt;<i> assigned over to you - see what Fatih stated, according to Mike.
</I>&gt;<i> And in all fairness to the original developers - their statements of
</I>&gt;<i> copyright should be left intact even in GPL software. 'Standing on
</I>&gt;<i> the shoulders of giants' - to quote Sir Isaac Newton - does not mean
</I>&gt;<i> you should forget about mentioning those shoulders.
</I>&gt;<i> After all, 'Free Software' does not stand for 'free for the taking'.
</I>

you are absolutly right .For a couple of reasons already explained to D#
team a very small amount of copyrighted D# code was *illegaly* present on my
IDE code base.

But please , we are talking about no more than 10 clases out of hundreds
that my code has .The code we are talking about has been removed and
rewriteen in less than 2 hours so please be fair with my project and my
intentions ...SDE is very diferent from D#.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sand SDE software is 100% GPL (General Public License).  If your
</I>software is
&gt;<i> &gt; also 100% GPL compliant, then you have no obligation to pay for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; licenses.  For further information on the GNU GPL, click here.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please note the following restrictions.  If these do not suit your
</I>needs,
&gt;<i> &gt; you should consider a commercial license.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   a.. Sand SDE is free use for those who are 100% GPL.  If your
</I>application
&gt;<i> &gt; is licensed under GPL, you are free to ship any GPL software of Sand SDE
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with your application.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   b.. Under the Open Source License, you must release the complete
</I>source
&gt;<i> &gt; code for the application that is built on Sand SDE, excluding the source
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code for operating system components that are usually installed on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; computer on which the application will be installed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   c.. As long as you do not distribute your application, you are free to
</I>use
&gt;<i> &gt; Sand SDE regardless of whether your application is GPL or not.
</I>Basically,
&gt;<i> &gt; the rule is, you can't distribute it unless 1) it's open source, or 2)
</I>you
&gt;<i> &gt; obtain a commercial license from Sand SDE.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   d.. You are allowed to modify Sand SDE source code any way you like as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; long as the distributed derivative work is licensed under the GPL as
</I>well.
&gt;<i> &gt;   e.. You are allowed to copy Sand SDE binaries and source code, but
</I>when
&gt;<i> &gt; you do so, the copies will fall under the GPL license.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The rule is every body can use this product for free but companies must
</I>pay
&gt;<i> &gt; a small fee if they are going to earn money with it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I do not want to sound like the 'GPL police', but proper attribution
</I>&gt;<i> should be honored.
</I>&gt;<i> I hope that this has now clarified my attitude towards these things.
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>              &quot;This manual says what our product actually does, no
</I>&gt;<i> matter what the salesman
</I>&gt;<i> may have told you it does.&quot; -In a californian graphic board manual,
</I>&gt;<i> 1985.
