</I>I am not aware of any facility to do this.  However, one could create or 
extend existing tools to do a prjx and/or a cmbx from the contents of a 
given directory.  Obviously, a lot of post user interaction would be 
require to insure that the correct references are included and 
conversely exclude .cs or .glade files that where &quot;guessed-in&quot; that 
should not have been. 

The question then becomes: Is it worth it?

If one has over 70 or so source files that all reside in the same 
directory and are also intended to be used in the resulting project, the 
answer  there would be a resounding yes.

On the other hand, if it is not a glade project and it includes only 5 
source code files and 2 of them are in different directory that is not 
child to the main project directory...

Parsing the Makefile would be less than amicable, because they are so 
&quot;author&quot; styled in structure -- there is too much variance across hand 
coded Makefiles.

Let's hear what others have to say on this topic :)
