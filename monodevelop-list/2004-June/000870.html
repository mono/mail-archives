<PRE>Wow, I am getting tired of  tracing down RPM dependencies for this 
MonoDevelop and Mono as a whole.  I thought I would mess around with 
Suse 9.1 personal and it appears to not have a develpoment sweet pre 
installed.  Does anyone out their have a recommendation for a 
distribution that would be setup with everything so that all I ahe to do 
is the rpm -uvh on teh mono all and all dependenecies are already ready 
to go in the distribution?

Man, it seems like something needs to be developed in Linux that will 
automatically search and find dependencies of RPMs on the net and let 
you choose ot auto install them.  Heck, I think red carpet is doing 
something like this, biut I am still trying to get past the freaking 
python install.

How in the world is LInux every going to be useable if a seasoned 
development newbie wants to look at Linux and it takes a WEEK to figiure 
out and get a development enviornment squared away.

On Microsoft, we are up and running in about half a day.  I am not 
talking seasoned developers, i am talking newbies out of college that 
don't know all the intricate details but want to start writing some code.

I did successfaully get mono installed and working, but again, I have 
yet to get mono develop to work properly.  Linux for the most part is 
reallly cool.  I have not used it for a couple of years waiting for the 
developers working on it to get it to the level of Microsoft's easy of 
use.  In   a real business situation, you cant afford all of this fluff. 
  You have to get answers, get htem fast, and move.  Linux still lacks 
in this area quite a bit.

Thanks,
