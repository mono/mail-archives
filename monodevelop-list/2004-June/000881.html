<PRE>We (the #develop team) will be looking at it very closely. Judging from the 
cursory look I had so far, it looks quite similar to large extents of 
#develop codebase - Mike will have a closer look at the source code level, 
and then we will know for sure.

If you were offering it GPL only, we wouldn't even comment - however, you 
offer it dual-licensed which you cannot do if you are not the copyright 
owner. You will understand that we do not necessarily like that idea that 
someone *might* unlawfully sell our work.

</I>&gt;<i>More than a product by itself SDE is a framework to create complex
