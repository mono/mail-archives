Which version of MonoDevelop are you using, and do you have the new
VB.NET compiler? It *should* work, but has been hampered by the fact
that until recently we didn't have a decent VB.NET compiler on Mono.

&gt;<i> intended to be part of the IDE, how might I as a long time VB designer with

The VB.NET language binding is written in C#, so you'd have to use
that if you wanted to work on it. Well, I guess you could rewrite it
in VB.NET if you really wanted to ;) We certainly support the VB.NET
language binding as a path into Mono for people with VB.NET
experience, but everyone working on MD so far has been using C# (or
Boo for that specific language binding).

Deciding which areas need work in probably something that you, as a
user, are best suited to decide. You can submit feature requests or
big reports on <A HREF="http://bugzilla.ximian.com">http://bugzilla.ximian.com</A> if you feel something is
missing or broken. We welcome any contributions at all, and if you
need help figuring something out, please don't hesitate to ask.
