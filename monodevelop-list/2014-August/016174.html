</I>&gt;<i> with text tags.
</I>The interesting case is to let the text flow around the fold marker.

&gt;&gt;<i> GtkSourceView is nice - I do not have complains about that but it doesn't

</I>&gt;<i> Some features are common to each text editor or IDE: undo/redo, file
</I>&gt;<i> loading and saving, margin/gutter (line numbers, marks, &#8230;), printing,
</I>&gt;<i> search and replace, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> GtkSourceView should be flexible enough for every text editor or IDE. If
</I>&gt;<i> some features are not suitable for a certain application, then
</I>&gt;<i> GtkSourceView should be improved (and bugs and feature requests should
</I>&gt;<i> be filed on bugzilla).
</I>undo/redo - depends on how it's implemented it's true - but we need to 
access the undo stack to draw the file changed state in the line number 
magin.
Some are not really easy - esp. loading - we've to use a custom encoding 
detector to be able to detect the most common VS.NET encodings. We used 
the gtk routine before but that didn't work for us.
Another common feature is cut &amp; paste - but I need to go deeply into 
that mechanism - we're using a custom clipboard format that contains 
context where the code was copied from. That's useful for supporting 
automatic string conversions when pasting from/to strings.
It's very hard to bring all this kind of flexibility into a common API.

Recently I reworked our editor API - that's why I know that this is very 
hard to do.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Is snapshotting different than a point in the undo/redo list? Or the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> text buffer saved to a temporary file?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes it is because it should be a O(1) operation that brings the whole text
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> representation in an immutable state so that it can be used by background
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> threads.
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting. What is usually done in GtkSourceView is to execute the
</I>&gt;<i> background work on small chunks of text in an idle. The remaining region
</I>&gt;<i> of text to analyze is maintained in a data structure. When an insertion
</I>&gt;<i> or deletion occurs in the text buffer, the region is updated
</I>&gt;<i> accordingly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you have an example of a feature that uses a snapshot?
</I>Background parsing for example does that. Auto save is another. 
Generally IDE's are doing heavy background analysis these days.
&gt;&gt;<i> We've really many features that are hard to implement in a general purpose
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> editor  - if it's not supported like our virtual indentation spaces. And now
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it's too late anyways - our text editor is now mature enough after 7 years
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of development.
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, it's too late for MonoDevelop. But it is maybe still the time for
</I>&gt;<i> other IDEs. And I prefer if GtkTextView and GtkSourceView are improved
</I>&gt;<i> instead of reinventing the wheel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Editors got reinvented more than twice - btw. other IDEs may use 
Mono.TextEditor as well :).
btw. we may even choose to implement another front end for other UI 
libraries. I agree that reinventing the text editor isn't great - doing 
a text editor is a very huge task - but I do not see a real way around 
that because there are too many using scenarios.

- But - we can share data structure ideas / maybe even test suites and 
so on.
&gt;<i> What is the virtual indentation spaces?
</I>That's like smart indenting unlike it doesn't add the indent to the text.
&gt;<i> In summary, if you still remember how GtkTextView works, what should be
</I>&gt;<i> improved or changed in GtkTextView?
</I>It has been ~7 years last time I looked at it. Everything I knew about 
it may not be true anymore.
But having a default folding implementation would be a good start for 
IDE use.
&gt;&gt;<i> (And as said - we've been using GtkSourceView before that and felt it was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> too limited for our use case at that time - 7 years ago - I think that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> GtkSourceView has evolved a lot since then. But atm I don't really see any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reason for switching back.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can you give one ? (The maintainance work isn't much right now - most of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ongoing editor work is implementing new features or changing old ones)
</I>&gt;<i> I think all the features of GtkSourceView are already implemented in
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop. Maybe the search and replace works better in GtkSourceView
</I>&gt;<i> (including regex search), I don't know. Last time that I've used
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop to test the search and replace, I've found a few bugs. Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> GtkSourceView has fewer bugs, since it is used by more applications and
</I>&gt;<i> tested in more different use cases. The GtkSourceView API is also well
</I>&gt;<i> documented.
</I>
The GtkSourceView search&amp;replace was implemented with taking our 
implementation as example/concept.
I remember that I did something wrong in the implementation - but it 
works well for me.

Regards
Mike
