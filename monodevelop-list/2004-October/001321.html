<PRE>Hi,

After a few tries, and without Visual Studio, I can't progress very much 
with monodevelop. I'm trying to implement, a simple task, a Comment 
Lines/UnComment Lines like in Visual Studio.
I can't get the task done because I don't know the MD struture and have 
nothing that really helps me. I mean: Autocomplete isn't working with 
project implemented classes, it looks like it's only working with the Mono 
namespaces. EX: I define a IWorkbechWindow variable and no autocomplete is 
availiable!
My second problem is that there is no way of sync with the classes Pad, this 
makes very hard to search for the time or the file to look into.

I'm starting to think that my best path is to implement a simple ASP.NET 
application that creates the complete struture to the project enabling me to 
check the classes as fast as possible.

If there are any solutions to the problems I expose here... fell free to 
help me.

Thanks,
Alexandre MP Gomes, Portugal
