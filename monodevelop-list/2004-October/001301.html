Why? Anjuta's development is totally stalled, and its written in C.

It already is. Have you looked at MD's source? (I know, it can blind you
and make you insane). Just about everything (Including the main window)
is a plugin.

As far as cross-IDE plugins, uh. not possible.

First, you are talking about 3 different apps, written in 3 different
languages using 2 different windowing toolkits. Second, the word
'plugin' means that it plugs-into-something. That something is pretty
app-specific always. It has to be, otherwise the plugin can't really do
anything.

&gt;<i> Think of MonoDevelop as a base where you can choose different project

</I>&gt;<i> plugins are nice but they can't control everything (example: themes).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
That is a totally awesome idea. Wait. Wait. Oh, thats right, thats
*exactly* how it is already set up! Your work here is done dude!
