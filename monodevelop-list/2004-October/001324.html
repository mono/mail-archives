Completion only works with referenced assemblies. You are most likely
not referencing MonoDevelop.Base.dll

The classes pad syncs on its own if I understand you correctly.

The real problem is that there is no working MonoDevelop solution you
can load. I am busy tonight and tomorrow, but I should have some free
time on Wednesday that I can spend to attempt to get this going. Note:
this would only be for having a project to load, there is no way right
now to build MonoDevelop from within itself.
