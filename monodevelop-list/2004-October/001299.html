I am not sure what you mean exactly.

There is no reason (that I can see) to attempt to integrate MD stuff
with Anjuta.

First, Anjuta is a completely different app that doesn't use C#. To
integrate the two, Anjuta would have to take a dep on Mono, which I
really just dont see happening at all.

Second, Anjuta provides little outside of what we already have, and that
little is cvs support. Writing cvs/svn/etc support into MD is a far more
managable task than attempting to get MD components running inside
Anjuta. And with far better payoff.

Maybe you should start out by explaining why there is any advantage for
MD components to be usable inside Anjuta, because, from here, it looks
completely pointless.
