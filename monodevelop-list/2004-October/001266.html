wxNET is not installing properly if MD is not automatically finding it.
It needs to be installing proper .pc files that are -pkg: referenceable
for mcs for MD to find it.

Yes, there is, however I believe it was broken until recently, and has
been fixed in SVN.

If you upgrade to MD from SVN, that problem should go away. (Note: The
Completion widget in SVN is new, and has one issue (that I am aware of)
revolving around ctrl+space, so upgrade only if you don't use that
functionality).
