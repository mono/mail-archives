<PRE>Hi, I'm trying to set up Monodevelop to code some wxNET (wxnet.sf.net) 
apps, I've installed the wxNET lib into the GAC, but Monodevelop doesn't 
seem to find it, is there any way to &quot;refresh&quot; the GAC list on MD?

Another problem: using SharpDevelop, there's an option to disable 
console output upon compilation/running, is there any way to disable it 
on MD?

Problem is that I get an annoying window with &quot;echo; read -p 'press any 
key to continue...'&quot; right before the wxNET app is launched, I was also 
getting this on windows but I could fix it by disable console output.

As you can see I'm trying to make a crossplatform app using wxNET, its 
imperative to make my app run on M$ framework.NET (I don't want to force 
my users to install mono on windows) and Mono on Linux/Mac, so I figured 
the best way to preserve compatibility was coding under Linux (I kinda 
wanted to try it aswell :D).

Cheers,
Edgardo
