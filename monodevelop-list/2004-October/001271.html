excellent.

Uh. Patches?

And on those specific topics, let me give you a bit of a rundown of the
current status.

NUnit: There is a WIP (Work in Progress) Addin in the tree already, that
can most likely be made working with less effort than starting up again.

Glade: We don't really want better Glade integration, because we want to
focus on a kick ass forms designer.

Forms Designer: Dan Winship at Ximian/Novell is going to be working on
an awesome forms designer. We plan to embed his work and use that, so we
end up with one single platform.

In bugzilla we have a lot of potential places for improvement, as well
as a lot I could list off the top of my head including refactoring
support, support for generics in our parser, Code folding, etc.

I think working with us, as opposed to forking is the best possible
decision, considering there are already many people working on this, and
who are already aware of the problem space.
