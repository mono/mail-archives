<PRE>Correction -

I tried running applications from the sample codes available on MonoDevelop website. Please find some of those applications attached and if possible, confirm if this gives any output at your end.

Thanks,
Manisha

Subject: [MonoDevelop] Trial version Help Needed

Hey Friends,

I am new to mobile development and am using the trial version of MonoDevelop. I tried running a couple of applications from the same sample codes available but none of the emulators seem to be giving any output. The emulator screen just opens and then nothing happens.

Can somebody please suggest if I am going wrong anywhere or will I have to purchase a licensed version to run my applications?

Please help.

Thanks,
Manisha
