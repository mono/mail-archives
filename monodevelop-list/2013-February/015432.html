<PRE>I'm not using XML serialization.  I do use System.Text.Encoding.UTF8,
perhaps that calls into some System.Xml stuff under the hood?

To a certain extent the continuation after the exception messages makes me
think they must be handled too, but I'm not sure why MD would break on them
in that case.  I've never messed with the Exceptions menu before (took me
about 20 minutes just to find it just now), and it seems like the default
is to not break on any unhandled exceptions.  But I can't be sure it's not
set to something weird as I'm not on my home computer at the moment.  I'll
check this out for sure when I get home tonight.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi all,

</I>&gt;<i> I've been working on an MD Addin to provide a C# REPL.  It's by no means
</I>&gt;<i> complete, but it's now reached the &quot;kind of working&quot; stage, where the
</I>&gt;<i> project would benefit from other developers' inputs, should anyone be so
</I>&gt;<i> inclined.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyhow, if anyone wants to take a look, you can find it here:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I should emphasize that at this point even basic features are not yet
</I>&gt;<i> complete, it is very lightly tested on Mac OS X only, there's no
</I>&gt;<i> documentation, and it's probably quite buggy and unstable.  But it's a
</I>&gt;<i> start :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some implementation details for the curious: it's basically a thin wrapper
</I>&gt;<i> around Mono.CSharp.Evaluator.  It requires Mono 3.0.x.  A separate process
</I>&gt;<i> is launched to host the interactive session.  The MD process communicates
</I>&gt;<i> with that process over a TCP loopback connection.  The key basic feature
</I>&gt;<i> that it currently lacks is the ability to send standard output from the
</I>&gt;<i> process that hosts the interactive session to the MD Pad.  An attempt at
</I>&gt;<i> this has been implemented using the output stream redirection facilities of
</I>&gt;<i> System.Diagnostics.Process, but it doesn't work, and I don't know why yet.
</I>&gt;<i>  I'm also getting exceptions sometimes when I run the addin in debug mode.
</I>&gt;<i> They are from attempting to load System.Xml and Microsoft.CSharp
</I>&gt;<i> assemblies, and it appears that they are trying to be found in the build
</I>&gt;<i> directory of my project.  Curiously, they do not show up in release mode,
</I>&gt;<i> nor do they prevent the proper functioning of the program if I just
</I>&gt;<i> continue on.  If anybody has any insight on those two issues, they would be
</I>&gt;<i> of particular interest to me, but I'd be interested in any comments you
</I>&gt;<i> might have.
