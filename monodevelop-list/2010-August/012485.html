<PRE>jmalcom: The tabbed view for different VCS views of the open file is
definitely in Git - that's how I get to play with all of this stuff and
pester Mike and co with my ideas :)

The tabs themselves are fine, it was just an oddity with the thicker GUI
designer bar above it. Because of the Sonar gradients then the tabs were
a lighter colour than the bottom of the designer bar, seemingly because
the gradient didn't get scaled but got cropped. If you can get Steic to
play nice then it shouldn't be a problem :)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so having them all rendered the same as tabs would seem to make sense.

I'll keep an eye on it. Hopefully the GSoC project will end up with
something that plays nicely and integrates with the rest of the tabs.
