VS does a split view for Winforms but not for anything else, so I very
much doubt it's a technical limitation. Winforms is essentially a
legacy designer - it used to store the GUI definition in a folded
method *in* the code file, so the combined view actually made sense
for that.

The more modern GUI editors in VS -- XAML, ASP.NET etc -- all have a
concept of &quot;codebehind&quot; being distinct from the GUI definition, even
though they also generate designer code. IMO the grouping works very
well for these, and I don't see why it wouldn't work just as well for
stetic, since it's much more akin to what we do. See also Xcode and
xib files.
