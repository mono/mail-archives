<PRE>Hello!

I've recently been thinking about how we can replace the tabs for files in
MonoDevelop into one file dialog.  We've all been there, we get into a
zone and by the time we come up for air, we have 25 or more files opened
and all those tabs for files are just a pain, because it makes it hard to
find the other dialogs we care about.  I've seen this discussed on IRC,
but I don't think I've seen anybody propose a solution.

The proposal is to create one tab for the file editor dialog and then
polish and enhance the new navigation breadcrumb control.  We enhance the
control by showing the currently opened file and then have functionality
to be a drop down for picking another opened file.  This will allow a
secondary way of navigating and also make available which files are opened
to the user.  The main way for navigating around is to use the new
navigate to command and use the navigate to dialog that we've all come to
love.  The rest of the navigation breadcrumb control will behave how it
does now, so for example when looking at it, you will see:  Opened File |
Current Type | Current Member.

Let's discuss to see how many like this approach and any issues that are
raised.

-Dale
