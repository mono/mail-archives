I just updated again and noticed the new tabs at the bottom for the
different types. They look like a good start, but I think that they'd
look a bit more cleanly integrated with GUI files in something other
than Sonar due to its gradient :)

One thing I wondered was whether we needed the &quot;Source/Visual/Actions&quot;
bar any more - could it not be integrated into the tabs as the first
few? &quot;Abstract Content&quot; is a bit of a clunky name, which does kinda
indicate that we've got a bit too much together. I'd consider &quot;Source&quot;,
&quot;Visual&quot;, &quot;Diff&quot;, &quot;Blame&quot; and &quot;Log&quot; as different views on the same thing
(viewing it as code, a GUI, as a comparison to a previous version, etc),
so having them all rendered the same as tabs would seem to make sense.
The only odd one out would be Actions, which is a view on a sub-part of
the Visual, but I'm not sure how that could be handled separately at the
moment without resorting to a pad, so it'd probably be best to move it
to a tab as well.
