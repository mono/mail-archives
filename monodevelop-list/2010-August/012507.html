I did suspect that there might be some limitations at the moment (I
think code analysis and Eclipse having its own built-in compiler have
been mentioned before). With the possibility aspect I was thinking more
of how it would interact with the aggressive auto-complete. I guess the
&quot;is it a delegate&quot; issue is something Java doesn't have, but would be
fixable with context awareness as you'd know if the variable was of the
delegate type or of another object type that meant the delegate method
didn't match.

Personally, I find &quot;auto-complete when I ask you, and guess parameters
while you're at it&quot; quicker than aggressive auto-complete, but that
might just be because of MD's comparative lack of context awareness.

Maybe the &quot;aggressive auto-complete that doesn't interfere&quot; way would be
to pop up a list of signature options as soon as the user types the
bracket (like the signatures list it gets already)?
