&gt;<i> Hi
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This represents my personal opinion:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it's wrong using the lane matcher - because:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) It gives back too many items
</I>&gt;<i> 2) It's slower (ok I admit that it has become quite fast compared to the 
</I>&gt;<i> one we shipped with 2.4)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> .. The input we have files/types/members is &gt;always&lt; camel or pascal 
</I>&gt;<i> cased
</I>
That's not true. Different projects and different languages may have
different conventions. The Mono coding guidelines explicitly state that
instance members should use underline as separator. C does not use camel
or pascal casing, yet we need to support the Navigate dialog and code
completion for it.


&gt;<i> and I'm thinking in that way when I filter items. I don't want 
</I>&gt;<i> some weird results because a misleading substring matches the word 
</I>&gt;<i> somehow. I want exact results and I want to get to the code completion 
</I>&gt;<i> result I want fast.
</I>&gt;<i> I use abbrevs and word jumps a lot. It's really nice to force word jumps 
</I>&gt;<i> with upper case letters. Once you get used to the prefix word matcher 
</I>&gt;<i> you'll enhance your typing speed a lot.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The last days I worked with the lange matcher had a negative impact on 
</I>&gt;<i> my workflow ... that's why I don't want this (not because I think my 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation is better or something stupid like that) ... I just want 
</I>&gt;<i> my old workflow back. The algorithm wasn't invented by me - it's the 
</I>&gt;<i> behavior R# has. I think that the guys at Jetbrains have done an 
</I>&gt;<i> incredible job at enhancing the productivity of developers - their 
</I>&gt;<i> completion filter is just a small but fine part of their product. I see 
</I>&gt;<i> the other approach as sub optimal compared to that.
</I>&gt;<i> Another point is - there is a difference in speeds ... it does matter if 
</I>&gt;<i> you wait for 200ms or 50ms ... the example input data is large ... but 
</I>&gt;<i> you can get that many ismatch requests in a project like monodevelop. 
</I>&gt;<i> The difference isn't as much as it is some weeks ago (lluis &amp; I 
</I>&gt;<i> optimized the other algorithm) but I still think that we need a very, 
</I>&gt;<i> very good reason to use a slower algorithm.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Internally we can't decide which one we choose
</I>
It's decided, but looks like you are unable to accept it.

&gt;<i>  - maybe some of you 
</I>&gt;<i> noticed that there are quite a few changes in that area - mostly each 
</I>&gt;<i> developer commented out the other ones work. I'm in charge for the 
</I>&gt;<i> completion - theoretically but lluis as offical project manager decided 
</I>&gt;<i> that we use his approach (it fails still the unit test suite about 
</I>&gt;<i> completion btw.) ... and if we decide to stick with that I think that 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll make a little fork of monodevelop that just contains this small 
</I>&gt;<i> change for personal use - if some people have interrest in that I'll 
</I>&gt;<i> make it  public.
</I>
That's not the right way of handling differences. I already told you. If
you have an usability problem file a bug report.

Lluis.
