<PRE>I'm guessing it is possible, but I'm not sure how at the moment! I'd
found a bug and wanted to give it a quick poke to see if it was
something I could report and fix at the same time. To give it a poke I
wanted to run it up in MD and debug it with a breakpoint to see what was
happening. It doesn't seem like a major thing for something that builds
cleanly with Make, but I'm getting 126 errors about missing assemblies
because it can't find namespaces and classes.

I don't know how it manages it when the code complies fine from the
command-line, but it really doesn't want to debug it as far as I can
find. I've attached the build output, in case it helps, and tried
manually running ./configure first, but other than that then I'm lost
for now.

I did try asking this on the MD IRC channel using the web interface, but
either the timezones are wrong or people are just really quiet on there.

Thanks,

IBBoard
