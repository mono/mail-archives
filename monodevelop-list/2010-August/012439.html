&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am using MonoDevelop 2.4, but experienced the same with git master.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After a lot of console applications and libraries I am in the process
</I>&gt;<i> of creating my real first GUI application which is meant to be used by
</I>&gt;<i> other people. Hence there are two things I need:
</I>&gt;<i> * A .desktop file to integrate with the user's desktop menu from where
</I>&gt;<i> he can start the application
</I>&gt;<i> * Makefile support so people can simply build and install the application.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Alright, it seems I can generate everything from within MonoDevelop. Nice!
</I>&gt;<i> However, there are a few things which are not working as I thought.
</I>&gt;<i> (Or as I expected them to be working.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (1) When I simply create a new GTK# application, generate makefiles
</I>&gt;<i> and close MonoDevelop without compiling running make fails complaining
</I>&gt;<i> about a missing Build() function. It seems I have to run configure or
</I>&gt;<i> autogen first, then compile in MonoDevelop and then I am able to
</I>&gt;<i> compile using the make command. I believe this has something to do
</I>&gt;<i> with the generated GUI files which I thus have to ship with my
</I>&gt;<i> sources. Not really a problem, it seems the file is not always
</I>&gt;<i> regenerated. And when it's available calling make and make install
</I>&gt;<i> works as expected.
</I>
GUI files are generated when you build the project, so you'll have build
at least once before generating the makefile.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (2) When I enable the run option using the Options menu of the
</I>&gt;<i> makefile integration in MonoDevelop it's not added to the makefile and
</I>&gt;<i> make run doesn't work. A run option is nowhere to be found in any
</I>&gt;<i> makefile related file. Would be nice, but I can live without.
</I>
MonoDevelop doesn't generate 'run' targets. That option can be used when
you enable makefile synchronization, to bind MD's run command to the run
target you have in the makefile.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (3) When using make install the .desktop file is not copied anywhere.
</I>&gt;<i> And this is currently the major issue. When I loop at other
</I>&gt;<i> applications I can see a lot of tricks with custom tools to install a
</I>&gt;<i> .desktop file but if this means I can no longer let MonoDevelop
</I>&gt;<i> synchronize the makefiles with the solution file it's of no help to
</I>&gt;<i> me. I want my interaction with the makefiles as limited as possible.
</I>
Make sure that the 'Include in Deploy' option is set for that file, and
that the target deply directory is &quot;.desktop application folder&quot;.

Lluis.
