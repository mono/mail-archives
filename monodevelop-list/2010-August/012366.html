&gt;<i> Hi
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The old algorithm is a bit slower, but it gives better search results.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For example, try looking for 'ccommand'. The list you get using the old
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; algorithm makes much more sense to me than what you get in the new one.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> Some wouldn't be the problem it's only a bit - it'. Yes the old one
</I>&gt;<i> finds more matches - I know that,
</I>
It's not a matter of finding more matches, but about properly ranking
them, and suggesting the best match.

&gt;<i> But I want to know from the users which search cases should be matched
</I>&gt;<i> - I just don't believe that the substring matching in the navigate to
</I>&gt;<i> dialog should be different than that in the code completion.
</I>
I agree.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I took the code completion algorithm as a start because of the speed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For MD alone we match up to 141702 items - that's on my machine:
</I>&gt;<i> 8623ms vs 128ms
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've implemented some caching algorithm that leaves us to match 90400
</I>&gt;<i> items. Thats still roughly 5200ms  vs 84ms on my system - thats not a
</I>&gt;<i> bit slower - thats magnitudes slower. I tested this with the stand
</I>&gt;<i> alone version &amp; took the MD numbers of items, it's hard to tell how
</I>&gt;<i> long it takes in monodevelop - could be more/could be less - but it's
</I>&gt;<i> another user experience when changing the algorithm. Thats why I've
</I>&gt;<i> came up with this again.
</I>
I'm ok with changing the algorithm if it is faster, but I don't want to
lose functionality.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, the new algorithm can't handle some queries. For example, if I try
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to look for CustomCommandCollection
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  using the strings 'comcoll',
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 'cuscoll
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ' or even 'commandcollection' I don't get any result.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Those issues should be fixed before switching to the new algorithm.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> This are two examples I would value as bug - I've not thought about
</I>&gt;<i> that case. They should match for the code completion as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I added them to the code completion bug unit tests. To match them I've
</I>&gt;<i> taken the other algorithm and used some optimizations and now it runs
</I>&gt;<i> the 90k items in around 2200ms - still there is room for improvement. 
</I>&gt;<i> But by changing to the other algorithm 2 unit tests failed. (another
</I>&gt;<i> reason to use one matching subsytem) 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The new matcher  matches &quot;AbCdEf&quot; when a filter &quot;bC&quot; is given. And it
</I>&gt;<i> matches &quot;DatabaseObject&quot; when &quot;DOB&quot; is given - the latter may match (I
</I>&gt;<i> don't think it should - upper case should always force a word jump
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO) - but the bug report was about
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;DatabaseObject&quot; vs. &quot;DatabaseObjectBase&quot;  - in that case
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;DatabaseObjectBase&quot; should be selected (however with &quot;dob&quot;, &quot;Dob&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;DOb&quot; the &quot;DatabaseObject&quot; is the better match).
</I>
When typing in lowercase, the algorithm should consider that any letter
can potentially be a word start. Also, short matches should have
priority over longer matches. So 'dob' should match 'DatabaseObject'.

I'm OK about interpreting upper case letters as a forced word start,
although I never use that. If I want to look for DatabaseObjectBase it
is faster to type 'doba' than 'DOB'.

&gt;<i> Do you agree on these cases ? (I'm always open for ideas how to
</I>&gt;<i> improve the matchding even more - the matching logic is an important
</I>&gt;<i> part of the IDE)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I see no reason for using two algorithms, using two would mean:
</I>&gt;<i> A) We never find all those issues
</I>&gt;<i> B) Monodevelop behaves incosistent (different filters for code
</I>&gt;<i> completion/navigation dialog) 
</I>
I also think it is better to have a single algorithm (unless the most
correct algorithm is too slow for code completion, in which case it
would make sense to use a more simple but faster algorithm for code
completion only).

Lluis.
