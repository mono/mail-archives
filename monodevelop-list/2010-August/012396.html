<PRE>Hi Troy,

I use perforce and MD alot at work too, You can get around your
read-only for un-edited (p4 edit) files by working in two ways,

1. p4 edit your whole solution

$ cd Solution
$ p4 edit ...
##  work work, edit edit
$ p4 revert -a ...  # revert files with no changes
$ p4 add new_files
$ p4 submit

or

2. switch off perforce's read-only mode 

$ p4 client

# set workspace Options field to include 
# &quot;allwrite&quot; instead of &quot;noallwrite&quot;

I perfer variations of #1, In my monodevelop I also have an external tool
setup to run p4 edit and p4 add on files, but usually have to manually
p4 edit at least the solution and csproj files before starting work.

I also have a perforce plugin for monodevelop about 25% done but I'm
currently planning on looking into how well the new git vcs plugin works
with p4-git to get at perforce

Best Regards

Ian

</I>&gt;<i>    workspace they are copied down as readonly files. It's quite often the
</I>&gt;<i>    case that we need to only work on one project or two within a solution.
</I>&gt;<i>    However, MonoDevelop seems to require that all &quot;.csproj&quot; files are
</I>&gt;<i>    writable if anything in the solution is changed. We've gotten around this
</I>&gt;<i>    problem by running scripts that change the permissions of all of the
</I>&gt;<i>    project files in the solution so that they are writable, then change them
</I>&gt;<i>    back before checkin to Perforce.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    We are planning to introduce our development process and tools (incuding
</I>&gt;<i>    MonoDevelop) to our team very soon. The team is quite large and we'd like
</I>&gt;<i>    to make it painless as possible for them to adopt the new workflow which
</I>&gt;<i>    is necessary for our cross-platform application.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    We are wondering if this is the desired behavior of MonoDevelop and if
</I>&gt;<i>    not, whether there are plans to address this problem.
