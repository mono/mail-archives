<PRE>2010/8/3  &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monodevelop-list">Krogerma at aol.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> We are wondering if this is the desired behavior of MonoDevelop and if
</I>&gt;<i> not, whether there are plans to address this problem.
</I>
I don't believe there is anything MonoDevelop should or could change.
You need to adhere to the perforce workflow. Some source control systems
use pessimistic locking. I guess perforce does, because those systems
fetch source files from the repository in read only state. To change a
file you need to &quot;checkout&quot; or &quot;edit&quot; it. The source control system will
lock the file in the repository and make it writable locally. When you
are done withe your changes you would commit to the repository, which
would set the file state back to readonly and would unlock it.

MonoDevelop cannot do anything about this. You either need to go through
the pain of file locking or maybe perforce can be configured to have
files writable and to use optimistic locking (CVS can be configured to
do either).

HTH,
Eric
