<PRE>I would like to propose we follow the GNOME HIG for dialogs.  

Or

Think of your mail or news reader.
Think of a file system browser.

	Stack tabs on the left.  View pane on the right.  (With option
to change this for the difficult to please).

Tabs could scroll forever with a clear intuitive UI.
Views such as most recently used could be available as alternate stacks
History could be a view with an unlimited size stack.
Filtering by flags could be used to reduce set to only modified files or
only files with TODOs or any other metadata or filtering criteria.
Search results could turn into just another stack and would not require
a separate construct.
The debugger could allow open current stack (which would use the stack
trace to build a list of files).
Etc.

Why only have class view and solution view?  Why not combine them into a
grand navigation view that allows us to join them all?
What is currently open is just one view.
Meta data can be shown or not (version, maintainer, last modified date,
lines of code, etc)
Errors could show up in this view too.  We would need to define (and
allow users to customize) what metadata is visible for what view.

Sorting and filtering is key.

Vertical screen real estate is more valuable than horizontal (especially
with guidelines that recommend no more than n characters per line).
