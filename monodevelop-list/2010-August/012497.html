<PRE>  Hi

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For consistency with aspx and xaml I would expect:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MainWindow.gtkx
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      MainWindow.gtkx.cs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      MainWindow.gtkx.designer.cs
</I>&gt;<i> I was prototyping that grouping too, but i felt that having cs file as a parent
</I>&gt;<i> would be better. My reasons were :
</I>&gt;<i> - similarity to WindowsForms designer in VS which have
</I>&gt;<i>    MainWindow.cs
</I>&gt;<i>      MainWindow.Designer.cs
</I>&gt;<i>      MainWindow.resx
</I>&gt;<i> - unlike aspx and xaml, gtkx files are not supposed to be edited directly
</I>&gt;<i>   (although I've done some work to make editing more convenient , now
</I>&gt;<i>    it uses XmlEditor for display)
</I>&gt;<i> - aesthetics issues, mixing on the same folder level ordinary cs files with
</I>&gt;<i>   gtkx ones looks not nice for me :)
</I>&gt;<i> - usability, editing source file happens more often than working in
</I>&gt;<i> the designer,
</I>&gt;<i>   if gtkx file would be a root, easy navigate to main source file is a must.
</I>&gt;<i>   I don't see how we can rid of this combined (designer/source) view, especially
</I>&gt;<i>   that people are accustomed to that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Your grouping is the right grouping. All other files than the 
MainWindow.cs are only there for one reason:
Make the life of the forms designer easier.
- The forms designers started out parsing the InitializeComponents () 
method from the forms class. I don't think that it's good to confront 
the user with this technical complexity (and you got the point - aspx 
etc. is for direct editing where gtkx files are only helpers for the 
forms designer no user should ever touch directly).

IMHO you did the right thing - gtkx files are monodevelop only - it 
doesn't make a reason to build the project this way (try to think what 
happens when the project is opened in vs.net or #develop).
I think the designer/source view is good for the gtk# designer. All IDEs 
(expect VS.NET - maybe a technical limitation in their IDE?) do a split 
system for forms.
Changing that needs a very good reason - because the VS.NET way has 
usability issues as well.

&gt;<i> It makes sense to integrate stetic source/designer buttons with bottom
</I>&gt;<i> pad (having multiple separate contents instead
</I>&gt;<i> aggregated one would further cleanup code). My only concern is that we
</I>&gt;<i> will have at least six tab pages : source (the same as a abstract
</I>&gt;<i> content?)/designer/groups/diff/blame/log. Would not be a bit clunky ?
</I>We have that right now as well &gt;but&lt; with one important issue: the 
stetic designer implements it's own subview system. I'll move the 
diff/blame/log thing to the right when it's too clunky - that should 
solve the issue.

Regards
Mike
