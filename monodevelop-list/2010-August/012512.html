<PRE> Hello all

Can anyone help me with this combo?  I've installed MonoDevelop v2.4,
and it runs, but when I tell it to make a test Moonlight app and try to
build/run it, it errors with &quot;Framework 'Moonlight / Silverlight 2.0'
not installed&quot;, and if I expand all the References in the &quot;Solution&quot;
section, I get a bunch of &quot;Assembly not available for Moonlight /
Silverlight 2.0 (in Mono 2.6.4)&quot; messages, one under each reference. 
Any ideas how to fix this?

I have the Moonlight plug-in installed from
<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/moonlight/,">http://www.go-mono.com/moonlight/,</A> and it works on a Silverlight app I
wrote using Visual Studio &amp; Silverlight in Windows.  Do I need it to be
in a system-wide location, and not just in my user profile?

Or maybe I need to install a &quot;Moonlight SDK&quot;?  I tried to find one of
these, but from what I gathered, this should have been bundled together
with the MonoDevelop sources, and I assume would have gotten built along
with it?  The availability of the choice &quot;Moonlight application&quot; in
MonoDevelop leads me to believe that it's built whatever it needs, but
I'm missing something.

I've also tried loading the VS 2008 solution I wrote (and successfully
built, and can successfully run on this system) into MonoDevelop, and
then I get the same errors I got before.

Documentation on the Mono, Moonlight and MonoDevelop pages is pretty
sparse when it comes to this combo; I'm getting the impression what I'd
like to do is very much under development, and perhaps just not ready
yet?  Or am I missing something?

Relevant info that I can think of that would be helpful is:

Mono has been built with the &quot;moonlight&quot; use-flag enabled, which says it
will &quot;Generate Moonlight 2.1 assemblies&quot;.

If you need any further info, let me know.  Any help would be
appreciated.  Thanks.
