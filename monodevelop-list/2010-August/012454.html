<PRE>Hi

 From the MD user point of view.

On 08/10/2010 10:48 PM, Mike Kr&#252;ger wrote:
 &gt; Therefore the 1st question is: Would you expect that both filters are
 &gt; the same - or not ?

I would expect the same filters.
However, I would consider changing order in navigate to dialog,
f.e. putting project/solution classes higher.


 &gt; Ok now we've the question: which algorithm to take. Do we need both ?
 &gt; When we take one for all occasions which one ? Are we completly idiots
 &gt; and another abbreviation approach would be better ?

I prefer the &quot;subword prefix&quot; matcher. It actually does the job, while
the first algorithm gives way too many results. I really don't need
'string' from 'n', or even 'Stream' from 'strm'. If a matcher suggests
these I would consider this as a bug...
The speed is really not the most important issue here.

About the Autotools/AutoTools:
My view is that Autotools class has simply a wrong name.
If I would want to find this class, maybe there should be some &quot;search 
for a class&quot; with substring matching as in 1st algorithm.

&gt;<i> Internally we can't decide which one we choose - maybe some of you

</I> &gt; I'll make a little fork of monodevelop that just contains this small
 &gt; change for personal use - if some people have interrest in that I'll
 &gt; make it  public.

Glad to hear that :)


Cheers,
wysek
