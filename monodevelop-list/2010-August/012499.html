<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Is anyone else using the latest Git build and having problems with
refactor actions going missing at times? I've yet to reliably recreate
it, but sometimes the keyboard shortcuts don't work and the Refactor
menu item isn't in the context menu. Given the latter then it isn't
surprising that it silently ignores the keyboard shortcut as it thinks
it isn't relevant.

I thought it was related to code compilation errors on startup, but I
just tested it and the code in the class that errored would extract
locals okay, but a class that it depends on wouldn't recognise
refactoring (i.e. the error was in a GUI class but the refactoring
failures were in API classes that the GUI uses - the wrong way around to
be build dependency issues).

Since I can't reliably recreate it, or even work out any kind of
definite trigger yet, I thought I'd see if anyone else was having the
problem before I filed a bug.

Thanks,

IBBoard
