<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; It currently completly ignore scase - 'DBO' == 'dbo' and would match
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 'dboField', 'DataBaseObject', 'DBOStuff' or 'OddNumberContainer'.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;      
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's wrong. The algorithm does not ignore case. It gives the correct
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; result for that last case.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    
</I>&gt;<i> 'DBO' and 'dbo' both matches dboField. That is the case I ment - this is 
</I>&gt;<i> an important difference of the two. In fact both algorithms are somewhat 
</I>&gt;<i> the same - I'm sure both could simulate each other with 1-2 small 
</I>&gt;<i> changes, that's why I found it important to give some examples where 
</I>&gt;<i> they differ.
</I>
That's the case I'm talking about. An uppercase in the filter will only
match word start in the text. The issue was reported and I fixed it.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; This makes sense for example when you have a term 'Autotools' and you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; search for 'tools' this is matched - the other algorithm won't match this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The plus side of this approach is that it gives you&gt;many&lt;  items in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; case you're not really sure what to look for.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;      
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Getting too many items is not a problem. If you do a search in Google
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you get thousands or millions of results, is that a problem? no, because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you know that Google is good at ranking, so in 99% of cases what are you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; looking for will be in the first results page. And in case you don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; find it, you can keep browsing other pages. The Navigate To dialog works
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the same way. It doesn't matter if it returns a lot of items as long
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as the best ones are shown at the top.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is than when I search for a 'string' I don't need viagra sex 
</I>&gt;<i> pills. And AFAIK we don't have currently very good ranking
</I>
Wrong. In fact, the ranking works very well. I've been using the Go to
File dialog intensively for the past year, and most of the time I find
the correct match by typing 4 or 5 letters. You'll never get weird
results like 'viagra sex' at the top. If you find a case where the
ranking is giving bad results, I'd like to know it.

&gt;<i>  - we've only 
</I>&gt;<i> pattern based ranking. I've already read a bit about how we could 
</I>&gt;<i> achieve some intelligent learning like google does. This would require 
</I>&gt;<i> some bigger changes in the data structures we have (maybe something like 
</I>&gt;<i> a suggest tree would work). I would love improving the results we give - 
</I>&gt;<i> if we could find a ranking system that would help that the user gets in 
</I>&gt;<i> 99% of the cases what he is looking for in the first 5 results it would 
</I>&gt;<i> be awesome.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is an area we should put some research in :) ... I think we're 
</I>&gt;<i> pretty good with our pattern based ranking - but google is better.
</I>
It is not worth spending time on this, because the current ranking works
well enough. 

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm ok about using this algorithm in code completion because the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; completion window is small and it is not sorted by rank, so unlike the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Navigate dialog, getting less results is better.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    
</I>&gt;<i> Ah ok, it sounded very different before, maybe I misunderstood 
</I>&gt;<i> sometehing?
</I>
Maybe. The only thing I always have requested is that the Navigate
window behaves like it used to do. I never told you how the completion
window should behave. It was you who unified the algorithms, not me.

Lluis.
