It used to keep it all in one file, but I don't think it does anymore
since they introduced partial classes in .Net 2.0. I've only got VS
Express 2003, but I've got some files that have a separate
&quot;ClassName.Designer.cs&quot; file. That said, all it really does is move the
InitialiseComponents() method to another file from what I can tell!
Looking around it looks like only 2005 and onwards supports it, so maybe
the files I have are ones that other contributors edited.

</I>&gt;<i> solve the issue.
</I>
Standard code already has four tabs, and Steic has four plus three
nested &quot;tabs&quot;, so I don't see it being any worse. Separating the VCS
from the editing (either with spacing or alignment) would work quite
nicely if it become a problem.
