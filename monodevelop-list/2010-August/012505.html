<PRE>Another suggestion from my work with Eclipse that I find hugely useful,
and which IntelliJ apparently does very well [1] (as I commented on to
Mike in a bug [2]). I thought I should send an email around instead of
submitting a ticket because 1) it is less likely to get lost under my
swarm of tickets and 2) I'm not sure how well it could realistically be
supported with MonoDevelop following VS.Net's &quot;aggressive auto-complete&quot;
path.

Basically, when you auto-complete a method in Eclipse then it also gives
you the different overloads of it in the list, allowing you to pick the
overload that you want. It will then pick the best matches for the
parameters and automatically inserts them (or null/default values if it
can't work them out, e.g. you've got to get the values from a different
method and don't have it in a variable). It then goes in to a
&quot;refactoring&quot; mode that lets you pick from lists if you want different
values with Enter completing the edit and putting you on a new line.

I find the &quot;complete the parameters&quot; behaviour very useful because (as
with the IntelliJ blog post [1]) it means that the IDE often writes more
of the code for you. I guess Bug 614147 [3] would get us a bit closer by
being more context aware, but it'd still often be more typing and the
first parameter would always have to list all possible values.

What do people think (especially Mike, I guess, since it is something I
think he'd have to implement)? Is it possible and is it something MD
would want to include? Hopefully I explained it well enough :)

Thanks,
