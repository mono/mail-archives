<PRE>&gt;<i> I think it would be useful to abstract things sufficiently to be able
</I>&gt;<i> to experiment with several different options. Several things have been
</I>&gt;<i> proposed -
</I>&gt;<i> 1) make the file tabs into real first-class monodevelop docking tabs
</I>&gt;<i> so they can be split side-by-side, dragged onto different monitors,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.
</I>
This would be interesting, provided the default behavior is something
useful enough that people aren't slapping MD's wrist and redocking
every file they open.

&gt;<i> 3) remove the file tabs, like xcode, and instead re-use one file tab
</I>&gt;<i> for displaying different files, with some kind of menu/switcher to
</I>&gt;<i> view unsaved and recent files (The VS2010 solution navigator also has
</I>&gt;<i> an interesting take on a recent/open/unsaved switcher).
</I>
I can't emphasize enough how uncomfortable this coding environment is for me.

&gt;<i> It would be interesting to experiment with a combination of these
</I>&gt;<i> ideas. For example, I like the VS2010 dockable file tabs. But I also
</I>&gt;<i> really like that in Xcode one doesn't have to explicitly close files -
</I>&gt;<i> if they're saved and disappear off the &quot;recent&quot; list, they're closed
</I>&gt;<i> automatically. Perhaps we could implement this behaviour while
</I>&gt;<i> retaining the tab bar. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to improve the
</I>&gt;<i> usability of the tab bar, for example an overflow dropdown instead of
</I>&gt;<i> the cumbersome sideways scrolling.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One thing I don't think we should do is to add lots of configurations
</I>&gt;<i> options to switch between different behaviours.
</I>
Agreed and agreed.
