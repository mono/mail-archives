<PRE>  Hi
&gt;<i> 1) My top feature of R# is, surprisingly, identifier coloring. Personally
</I>&gt;<i> for me it significantly simplifies mental parsing of the program. Being able
</I>&gt;<i> to easily distinguish fields, methods, locals and arguments is invaluable.
</I>&gt;<i> Any ideas how I can achieve this with MonoDevelop? I tried semantic
</I>&gt;<i> highlighting, but it seems to only highlight class names (e.g. within
</I>&gt;<i> typeofs).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Atm no - got really an option doing that with the current parser layer - 
but it's on my todo list.

&gt;<i> 2) Another thingie in R# that I also use frequently is &quot;Ctrl+Alt+Space&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> which displays an intellisense list of applicable methods that gets
</I>&gt;<i> populated from all referenced assemblies and namespace, *regardless* of
</I>&gt;<i> whether there's a corresponding &quot;using&quot; at the top of the file. So, if I
</I>&gt;<i> have lots of utility extension methods (and I do), I don't have to populate
</I>&gt;<i> usings first or enter a name and then wait for the quick-fix popup to
</I>&gt;<i> emerge, I just type several first symbols of the method name and then hit
</I>&gt;<i> Ctrl+Alt+Space - it will automatically search through my references and
</I>&gt;<i> auto-import namespaces if necessary. How does one achieve the same effect in
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop? I tried &quot;Toggle Completion Suggestion Mode&quot;, but didn't manage
</I>&gt;<i> to figure out what it does.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>We have something like that - your hotkey should work.

&gt;<i> 3) If we talk about navigation, I must confess that I'm impressed by the
</I>&gt;<i> speed of various &quot;Go To...&quot; dialogs. However, I wasn't able to find
</I>&gt;<i> analogues of several important features I use every day. Firstly, &quot;Go To
</I>&gt;<i> Definition&quot; doesn't display something like Studio's assembly browser (or w/e
</I>&gt;<i> it is called) when I use it on a library class. Secondly, it appeared that
</I>&gt;<i> I'm quite addicted at Ctrl+clicking method/class usages to go to definition.
</I>&gt;<i> It seems, that both features are missing. Any workarounds?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>ctrl clicking is missing atm - workaround: Implement it - you've the source.
(or wait for we doing that - we'll do that 100% ... I want a nice 
underlining effect when holding control,
again postponed till the new parser layer is in place).

we've an assembly browser.

&gt;<i> 4) (An offtopic). Expanding the topic of navigation, I'd love to ask your
</I>&gt;<i> opinion on Reflector's replacement. Yeh, of course, one can run Reflector
</I>&gt;<i> under Mono, however, most navigation features in Reflector depend on IE, so
</I>&gt;<i> they become broken in Linux. Any ideas here?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>We've an assembly browser for that :)
&gt;<i> 5) Finally, is there a possibility to turn off automatic highlighting of
</I>&gt;<i> local/parameter usages within a method. That's a rough analogue of R#'s
</I>&gt;<i> Alt+Shift+F7, however, sometimes it's annoying, so I'd love to disable this
</I>&gt;<i> feature by default and toggle it whenever I need it. How do I do that? Upd.
</I>&gt;<i> Yeh, a small addition. Is there a way to make those symbol highlighting
</I>&gt;<i> persistent as in R#, so that they don't disappear whenever I move the caret
</I>&gt;<i> away from the symbol of interest?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>No - atm not.
&gt;<i> I'd like to stress it once again - I'm very pleasantly surprised to see that
</I>&gt;<i> overwhelming amount of my favourite VS+R# features have equivalent or better
</I>&gt;<i> analogues in MD. Yeh, there are some bugs (e.g. with extract/inline variable
</I>&gt;<i> refactorings), but they can be tolerated - overall quality is still pretty
</I>&gt;<i> impressive.
</I>.. I hope I can work on the refactoring/language support stuff again 
after the next release.

Regards
Mike
