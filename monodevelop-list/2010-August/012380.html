<PRE>Dear monodevelop-list:
 
I'm a cross-platform consultant currently working under contract for a  
large company.
 
We are using MonoDevelop on Mac, SuseLinux and Windows. I must say that the 
 tool is quite usable and has come a long way in the past couple of years 
since I  used it last.
 
We are currently having an annoying problem with the Perforce version  
control system. When the Perforce client downloads files to the local  workspace 
they are copied down as readonly files. It's quite often the case  that we 
need to only work on one project or two within a solution. However,  
MonoDevelop seems to require that all &quot;.csproj&quot; files are writable if anything  in 
the solution is changed. We've gotten around this problem by running scripts 
 that change the permissions of all of the project files in the solution so 
 that they are writable, then change them back before checkin to Perforce.
 
We are planning to introduce our development process and tools (incuding  
MonoDevelop) to our team very soon. The team is quite large and we'd like to  
make it painless as possible for them to adopt the new workflow which is  
necessary for our cross-platform application.
 
We are wondering if this is the desired behavior of MonoDevelop and if  
not, whether there are plans to address this problem.
 
Sincerely;
Kurt Matis
Troy, NY
