<PRE>Hi,

Tomorrow I'm going to commit a long time due reorganization of the
extension point hierarchy. This reorganization was needed because the
current hierarchy was very incoherent, we were using a mixture of
SharpDevelop and MonoDevelop names, and it was based on the old SD
assembly organization, which has changed a lot in MD.

If you are working on an add-in located outside the MD SVN beware that
you'll have to update all paths in the .addin.xml file. I'm going to
send a list of path equivalences after committing the change.

I'm also going to commit tomorrow some changes in the add-in
architecture. First of all, all add-in manifests will be embedded as
resources in the corresponding assemblies. This is the recommended setup
for all MD add-ins from now on. Second, all add-ins in Core/src will be
converted to add-in roots, which in Mono.Addins terminology means that
they will be like regular libraries (extensible libraries, but not
dynamically loaded by the add-in engine). I hope that all this, together
with some improvements I've made in Mono.Addins will reduce some of the
setup problems we've been suffering (e.g. the IDE application not found
error).

Lluis.

</PRE>
