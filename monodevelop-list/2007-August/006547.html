Yep, all the time.  Do a save-all before you edit any UI stuff, and
especially before you create a new widget/window/etc... as it crashes
almost every time when you create a new widget.

Often you can create one widget,  attempting to create a second in the
same session reliably crashes for me.  I restart MD before I create a
new UI element.

</I>
Yep,  but that has gotten better.  With recent versions I just see hangs
when editing code, and pretty rarely;  the window becomes an
unresponsive grey rectangle.

&gt;<i> So I was wondering whether this kind of instability is typical at the 
</I>&gt;<i> moment or if I need to start looking at my configuration to try and find 
</I>&gt;<i> out why this happens? 
</I>
Typical.

&gt;<i>  I don't have any such problems with other 
</I>&gt;<i> applications, but I don't really use any other Gnome applications.  Do 
</I>&gt;<i> you think it's worth me trying to build everything myself from source?
</I>
I don't understand the logic whereby building-from-source will provide a
more stable application.  My decade plus experience indicates that an
unstable app is unstable because the app is unstable;  very rarely
because of a glitch in the sorcery of the build, packaging, dependency
process.
 
&gt;<i> Any advice or comments from people using MonoDevelop with a similar 
</I>&gt;<i> setup would be much appreciated since I'm quite new to linux and not too 
</I>&gt;<i> sure where to begin...
</I>
MonoDevelop is a great tool;  and despite its wackiness still
contributes to my productivity [I've also used it enough to have gotten
good at gut-feeling when the next thing I do is going to make it fall
over].  It is much better than it used to be, and I assume the remaining
issues will get washed out in time.  It is certainly the first really
useful Open Source IDE I have seen since my switch from Windows to UNIX
(back in the Borland/OWL/WfWg days).
