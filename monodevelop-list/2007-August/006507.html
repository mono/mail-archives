<PRE>Hello

For several months I only use Mono and MonoDevelop to develop my .NET 
applications. Right now I can develop my objects in Mono / MonoDevelop 
and import them to SharePoint 2007 for example. Even I could not create 
ASPX pages that use WebParts, I can create them and use in MOSS 2007.

There are few points that I would like to see in MonoDevelop that will 
boost all my (and other) development.

1&#186; Collapse parts of Code in Regions
LLuis told me that this is implemented in GTK 2.10. MonoDevelop use now 
2.8 (something like this). When we can have this feature?

2&#186; Better code-completion even in HTML files.
I think (this is my opinion), make code-completion work on ASPX files 
will boost the ASP.NET development. Of course this is not a priority 
problem.
In ASPX files when we write &quot;&lt;&quot; and MonoDevelop should be able to show 
us all the kind of objects (HTML or ASP.NET) that we could write. Even 
inside a tag (HTML or ASP.NET) the code-completion should give us all 
the options that we can use.
Inside a tag (HTML or ASP.NET) when we open the option CssClass, 
MonoDevelop should be able to know what CSS files this page use and show 
all the Css-Class available to be choose.
VisualStudio do this very well and the VS2008 have all this features.

3&#186; Of course, debugger will be nice. Right now I can work without it, 
but if we have will be good.



I know that this is now mandatory suggestions but are my suggestions.

Continue the good work team.
