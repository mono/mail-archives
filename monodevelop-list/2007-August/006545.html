<PRE>Hi, I've just started using MonoDevelop on Kubuntu Fiesty (64-bit).  
Initially I was using v0.12 from the distribution repositories, but 
found it very unstable, so now I've installed v0.15 using debs from 
getdeb.net which is slightly better, but very often I find that the 
whole IDE just crashes and disappears with no error messages.  In none 
of the cases have I found the crashes to be immediately reproducible by 
doing the same thing - most often it just happens when selecting 
something, often in the Stetic GUI designer window but also in the 
MonoDevelop GUI itself - sometimes just clicking to position the cursor 
when editing code!

So I was wondering whether this kind of instability is typical at the 
moment or if I need to start looking at my configuration to try and find 
out why this happens?  I don't have any such problems with other 
applications, but I don't really use any other Gnome applications.  Do 
you think it's worth me trying to build everything myself from source?  
Any advice or comments from people using MonoDevelop with a similar 
setup would be much appreciated since I'm quite new to linux and not too 
sure where to begin...

Thanks,
Will
