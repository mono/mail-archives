I experience problems quite often, as well as severe cpu usage when
saving a window that contains complex custom widgets (as in lots of
widgets in those custom ones).

Crashes aren't as bad as they used to be, but I still feel the need to
save often (something which is a pain as it hits the massive slow down I
see, yes this is reported as a bug, lacking a test case as I can't
separate one that shows it from my project)

I am using Gutsy + svn monodevelop, although I haven't done anything
with stetic in the past few weeks so things may have improved.
