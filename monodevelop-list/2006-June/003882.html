I usually inline or snip.  What post are you referring to that I didn't?
 My apologies.

I have been programming for many years.  However I am a newbie to
Gtk+/Gtk#.  I would love to help with Monodevelop one day.  I just need
to get up to speed on Gtk and other Gnome libs.

&gt;<i> As I can remember some talk about possible implementations took place

</I>
The last option sounds the best to me.  How much performance does an
editor really need?  Have you ever used some of the big and bloated Java
IDEs?  Some of them can be dog slow.  I would think as long as you can
type in real-time and get code completion between 250-500 milliseconds,
it would be perfectly usable.  The only major requirement IMO is that
the highlighting happen automagically.  I remember using the Bluefish
editor once, just once.  There is an option under the Document menu
titled &quot;Update Highlighting&quot; (or press F5).  Having to manually update
syntax highlighting is a pretty poor implementation IMO.  I never have
to manually update syntax highlighting in vim.
