<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Is there a way to add it?  Why can't you let developers make their own
</I>&gt;<i> choice?  Isn't that part of what Linux and Open Source is about?
</I>
I think that we need to add support for Fixed containers, and I also
think that we need to make Stetic simpler when dealing with tables and
boxes as it is confusing to people.

Currently I do not have a lot of constructive feedback on how to improve
the Stetic table containers.  I know that SpecTcl had some fairly
interesting concepts that made creating UIs with tables a lot simpler
(some markers for columns to resize, insert;   A word-processor-like
toolbar to control alignment, &quot;filling&quot;, padding).

I also know that Dan was thinking about having some kind of templates
that would by default lay out some dialogs with some standard looks and
parameters.

I have uploaded SpecTcl here:

	<A HREF="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/tmp/SpecTcl1.2a3.tar.gz">http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/tmp/SpecTcl1.2a3.tar.gz</A>

It seems like a good source of ideas to improve upon Stetic, which is
currently very much like Glade.

Miguel.
