<PRE>I've installed mono / monodevelop 0.11 in linux using the linux-installer
and monodevelop installs, runs and builds things ok, but the syntax
highlighting doesn't work.  When I go to options, syntax highlighting, the
combo box is empty, and if I fiddle with anything on that dialog monodevelop
locks up.

I've installed under suse 10.1 and fedora 5 - same problem.
I've installed older versions of mono - same problem.

Looking up the list, other people have had the same problem.  Someone said
it was to do with mime stuff being wrecked - I reinstalled/updated anything
to do with mime using the package manager but this did not fix anything for
me.

Monodevelop without syntax highlighting doesn't feel quite right!

Can anyone tell me how to get syntax highlighting working?
And why is monodevelop so fragile in this respect?  Syntax completion works
nicely (in color) but not the overall syntax highlighting.

Thanks
Andy Bulka


How I installed:
 
<A HREF="ftp://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.15/linux-installer/2/mono-1.1.15_2-install">ftp://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.15/linux-installer/2/mono-1.1.15_2-install</A>
er.bin
as a regular user under linux (doesn't seem to produce a working monodevelop
when done via a gui file explorer or as command line administrator)
