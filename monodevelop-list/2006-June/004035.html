<PRE>I've been working with the Notebook control and there are some quirks
that I wouldn't mind seeing some changes to:

Tab Pages Exposed As A Collection
==================================

- Tab pages should be a collection, with that collection being exposed
as a property of an instance of NoteBook i.e.:
  Notebook notebook = new NoteBook();
  notebook.TabPages.Add( &quot;This is a new page&quot; );
  TabPage tabpage = notebook.TabPages[0];
  tabpage.Text = &quot;This is new text on the same tab page&quot;;

- The example brings me to my next point: Tab page labels should be
added automatically, and exposed as the &quot;Text&quot; or &quot;Title&quot; property for
a single tab page.  In the example above, I am setting the &quot;Text/Title&quot;
property of a new page.  

Why expose a collection of tab pages
=====================================

Exposing the child tab pages in a Notebook as a collection would allow
things like:

  int i = notebook.TabPages.Count;
  TabPage tabpage = notebook.TabPages[&quot;page1&quot;];

And would eliminate (IMHO) ugly methods like:

GetNthPage(),
GetTabLabel(),

of which, GetNthPage is misleading because it doesn't even return the
NotebookPage, but return an instance of Widget, which still cannot be
casted to a NotebookPage!

Can Still Retain Advanced Label Functionality
=============================================

Perhaps for more advanced formatting, you can still expose the tabs
label as a Label property:

  TabPage tabpage = notebook.TabPages[0];
  tabPage.Label.RederIcon(...);

Reference To Current TabPage, Not Index Of
=========================================

The Page property that currently exists in a Notebook instance should
not return the index of the active page, but rather should return a
reference to the active page:

  notebook.Page.Text = &quot;Some new text for this tab(again)&quot;;

Summary
========================================

I think with these few changes to the Notebook, it can be a very
powerful tab-based container, and would propel it past the TabControl
control in .NET which (again IMHO) is much easier to work with and more
logically structured.
