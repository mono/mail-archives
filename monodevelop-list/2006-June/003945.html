<PRE>Miquel,

First; I bow to your superior knowledge and experience here.  I have to
say though that I don't see what ideas you would use.  You jostled me
enough to grab the archive ;)

        In SpecTcl, one creates the desired widget layout in the
        windows, one adds extra code that should be run each time such a
        window is created and this is saved in a file named something
        like foo.ui (SpecTcl's own file format). Hereafter, SpecTcl can
        generate a Tcl/Tk file (foo.ui.tcl) which contains a function
        (foo_ui). When called with an existing frame or toplevel as the
        first argument, this function creates the widgets as children of
        its first argument. All that is left for you to do is to source
        the Tcl/Tk file (foo.ui.tcl), create a toplevel or frame and
        call the function (foo_ui) with the frame/toplevel as the first
        argument.

It seems that Stetic is fairly tightly coupled to GTK and that's OK by
me.  If it's eventually going to handle other GUI frameworks then some
constraints move into an abstraction layer around the implementing
toolkit.  I'd rather see Stetic do one thing well than approximate a lot
of things.

OTOH, if Stetic remains a GTK designer, then -to me- the only real issue
is &quot;can it handle all GTK widgets?&quot;.  If gtk.Fixed is not deprecated
then an obvious case for its support in Stetic can be made, despite the
obvious pitfalls.  I'd rather be given the rope and I'll take
responsibility if I'm hanged.   ;)

I get the impression that you see a rather more elegant use of SpecTcl
concepts and that is what I'm actually asking about.  Can you elaborate
please?

Best Regards,
-rsh
