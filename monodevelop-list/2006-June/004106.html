There's no technical dificulty here, it is a design decision, that
I've been advocating for some time.

&gt;<i>       * When building a dll which implements both widgets and windows
</I>&gt;<i>         that contain instances of those widgets. The problem in this
</I>&gt;<i>         case is that we need to have the widget description before
</I>&gt;<i>         compiling, but we don't have a dll to reflect.
</I>
Yes, that is why in VS.NET normally you separate components into
topologically-lower libraries and the windows/forms that use them in
other libraries or the main exe. After design is finished, some
reusable windows may be rafactored (moved) to the lower libraries, as
it is just a design-time issue. Not the cleanest thing but
nevertheless usable.

&gt;<i> So we still need to support the xml model, and I'm not sure it is a good
</I>&gt;<i> idea to provide another model for describing widgets. In any case I
</I>&gt;<i> don't think that mixing both models is good. A library should describe a
</I>&gt;<i> widget either using xml or reflection, but not a mix of both.
</I>
Yes, we shouldn't mix things. I vote for reflection all the way but I
will defer it to the time I have some working code to show...

Fun,
