Ahh, I see your point.   It's just that the default acts differently
from what I'm used to.

You're right, of course.  One of the problems I'm having is knowing
which container will do what I need.  I guess it will just take a little
longer.

Again, I'm very glad to see Stetic added to Monodevelop so please don't
take as complaints.


&gt;<i>  to think the overall layout first, and know the available containers

</I>

Cool!   A mini-tutorial  ;)

&gt;<i> That works for 99% of the dialogs and simple windows I need to design,
