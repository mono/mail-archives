<PRE>Hi

After some weeks of working with Monodevelop, I've decided to
participate in its development.

I have found a bug (or at least something I personally consider a bug)
and have tried to fix it - just for practice.

I have finished fixing it and I want to propose the solution to be
committed to SVN. In fact this is more a proposal to extend the
functionality of Monodevelop's architecture then merely a bugfix. (The
report of this endeavour is located below.)

Aside from this problem, I have looked into the TODO section, and I must
say that momentarily I'm especially interested in the C# 2.0 parser.
Also, I'm willing to improve the way code completion works - there are
still some issues about code completion in monodevelop that I think
should be fixed. I would also like to contribute to ASP.NET development
support in monodevelop and Web Service integration.

Please, do point me to people who can give me some assignments.

If it needs mentioning: I'm not a participant in google's summer of code
but I want to commit myself to monodevelop for a longer period - if God
will allow me to.
----------------------------------------
Here goes the REPORT of the aforementioned problem:

PROBLEM: If you try to 'Save As...' the Welcome page, it will throw an
exception.
DESIRED EFFECT: a) Not to enable 'Save As...' in the Welcome page at all
or b) fail silently.
GENERALIZATION OF THE PROBLEM: Not to enable saving for documents which
don't make sense to be saved.

REPORT OF THE SOLUTION:
- I have added an IsSavable property to IViewContent
- I have added a SavableChanged event to IViewContent
- I have added an update handler for the SaveAs command in
ViewCommandHandlers
- I have changed the behaviour of methods 'Save' and 'SaveAs' in
MonoDevelop.Ide.Gui.Document to make proper use the newly added
IsSavable property
- I have changed some (but possibly not all) classes in some AddIns to
accommodate to changes made in IViewContent
- Made some changes in the WelcomePageView to fix the exception that
happens at 'Save As...' (also, there is a minor fix in the code that is
not related to the problem)

Diffs are attached

See ya

P.S.: I find it a wonderful coincidence that my first attempt to
contribute involved the WelcomePage.
