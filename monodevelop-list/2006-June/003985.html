<PRE> 

One of the nicest features of Monodevelop is its ability to import
VS2003 solution files into Monodevelop and then build a VS2003 created
project. This support worked pretty flawlessly for us. We  had a few
rudimentary tools that we wrote with WinForms and we were able to very
quickly port our application across to a Linux box (RedHat and Suse).

 

We've since moved to .NET 2.0 and VS2005 - and VS2005 has switched its
solution files to some new funky format. Is there any possibility that
Monodevelop will be adding this support as well?

 

Thanks

Krishna Ganugapati
