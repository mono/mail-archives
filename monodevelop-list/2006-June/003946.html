<PRE>You've probably got plenty of ideas to be running with for now, but if
you do get time, please also take a look at what eclipse currently
does - some of it is even better than vs2003 (IMHO).
For example, eclipse has completion of parameters, so you type a
method name and an opening bracket and it will fill in the
pararameters with ones of suitable types. Focus is first passed to the
first parameter, where you can either accept the first choice, choose
an alternative parameter from a list, or type something else in; when
you press return, you move to the next parameter and again can select
from a list. In many cases, it is possible to type the first
characters of the method name, press ctrl-space to complete it, type
'(' and hit return a few times to enter a long line of code. My
description probably hasn't done this justice, but it does really make
you more productive.

Since you are working on code completion, perhaps it might also be
worth considering looking at a more advanced search interface too,
using the same data as used by code completion. In eclipse, there is a
code search feature (different to plain text search) where you enter a
full class, method or field name and can search for items such as all
references to a method call, all implementors of an interface, all
write accesses or read accesses of a  variable. Since all this data is
already in memory or at least cached in an easily navigable form, this
type of search can be much faster than a plain text search, as well as
producing more relevant results.

Anyway, I guess there are probably more urgent features at the moment,
such as showing the types and names of the parameters in a tooltip.

Good luck!

Mark
