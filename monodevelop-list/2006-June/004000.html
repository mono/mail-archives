&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One of the nicest features of Monodevelop is its ability to import
</I>&gt;<i> VS2003 solution files into Monodevelop and then build a VS2003 created
</I>&gt;<i> project. This support worked pretty flawlessly for us. We  had a few
</I>&gt;<i> rudimentary tools that we wrote with WinForms and we were able to very
</I>&gt;<i> quickly port our application across to a Linux box (RedHat and Suse).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We&#8217;ve since moved to .NET 2.0 and VS2005 &#8211; and VS2005 has switched its
</I>&gt;<i> solution files to some new funky format. Is there any possibility that
</I>&gt;<i> Monodevelop will be adding this support as well?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>SharpDevelop has VS2005 project support. The code can be imported to
MonoDevelop even now. But there is one important problem. Code reads
files from solution, writes it on exiting and so on. But it's using
MSBuild for build (executes method Project.Build (&quot;Build&quot;)). With the
current state of MSBuild implementation in Mono it won't work.

Maybe someone can use code from SharpDevelop to make addins that
converts project files to MonoDevelop format. Paco Martinez was doing
something to add support of VS2005 to his converting program (already
used in MonoDevelop).
