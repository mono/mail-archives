I think it is more work to add that then some people may realize.  I
(naively) think it would require an entire new designer engine apart
from the current one that has been evolved from the glade tools.  So I
don't think that monodevelop is trying to make your life difficult on
purpose.  I would personally rather see a matisse like approach rather
that adding support for gtk.fixed into stetic.

</I>
I agree, but keep in mind some of those tools have many, many developers
that work full time on those features.  Also, they have been around for
much longer so they have had time to implement more nice things.
