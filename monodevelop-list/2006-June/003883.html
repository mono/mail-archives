</I>I agree, if there are core developers reading this, please add the
fixed container so those of us that are used to win32 development
can have something that is similar.

I don't want to hear &quot;You have the source&quot; fix it yourself either, I am
not a monodevelop hacker and by the time the learning curve is out of
the way I would have wasted a ton of time, so let's not start the you 
have the source thing. (I only mention this because every time I have 
pointed out a shortcoming in a open source project someone will say it)

I am sorry(not trying to start a flame war) but the whole panel way of 
building a GUI is not intuitive at all and makes designing a simple GUI 
a huge pain in the rear. A better solution would be to have 
anchor/alignment properties or something similar for the fixed panel, so 
I can make a edit control resize if I want to, that's how it's done in 
Delphi and VS.net. Also in Delphi I can put a panel and I can set 
alignment properties if I want stuff to resize automatically, for 
example I can put a panel and align it to bottom, add a splitter then 
another panel and align that to client.  The fact that MonoDevelop tries 
to force the whole panel thing is ridiculous.

I love Linux and open source, but the development tools available pale 
in comparison to Delphi or VS.net (Delphi is the best of course :-)  The
only one that is close right now would be NetBeans 5.x, sorry the
eclipse GUI builder stinks.

If Monodevelop is to be a success it needs to be easy to use, think VB 3 
back in the early 90s.  without a doubt VB 3 is what led to the huge 
popularity of windows.  The same thing could happen to Gnome and Linux.

Thanks in advance for listening :-)
