If it works for *most* people then that's still a little fragile -
especially when I'm one of the people for whom it doesn't work!  And on two
different linux distros (fresh installs, too).

You are right - Gedit doesn't have syntax highlighting either!  I didn't
have gedit installed, used yast to install it and verified this.

I am running under KDE.

I don't have a directory called ...gtksourceview-1.0/language-specs/ in my
home directory either - maybe I need to be running gnome for all this to
work?

</I>&gt;<i> Can anyone tell me how to get syntax highlighting working?

You shouldn't need to do anything special to make it work. It should
work just fine in Suse 10.1 (it does for me).

&gt;<i> And why is monodevelop so fragile in this respect?  Syntax completion
</I>works
&gt;<i> nicely (in color) but not the overall syntax highlighting.
</I>
I don't think it's fragile. It works for most of people. Syntax
highlight is not implemented by MonoDevelop but by gtksourceview. Do you
get syntax highlight if you open your files with GEdit?

Lluis.
