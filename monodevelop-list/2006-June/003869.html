<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Currently, that Container isn't shown in the Containers list and it
</I>&gt;<i> won't (probally) be due to disadvantages commented earlier, you may
</I>&gt;<i> request that feature to Core MonoDevelop developers to add it in future
</I>&gt;<i> releases, however I don't support adding that behavior.
</I>
Well, I believe that we eventually need to support it, it is just a
matter of time and resources.

Tables and boxes are probably fine for many applications that will
target many different devices and many different languages, but many
people want tool that they can use to create a quick application, and
not necessarily something that will have the same reach or be run under
hundreds of different scenarios, they need something that works.

Its like claiming that we should not have shell scripts and everything
should be scripted instead with Python or C# because they are &quot;the right
way&quot;.   They might the right way for a different scale of problem, but
you should consider that not everyone has the same spectrum of uses that
you do.

Miguel.
</PRE>
