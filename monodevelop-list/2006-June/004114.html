Build complete -- 0 errors, 11 warnings

---------------------- Done ----------------------

Build: 0 errors, 11 warnings

As you can see, it has only warnings.
The main function is in file Liss.cs
I created an object &quot;parser&quot; of class Parser. This classes is defined in
file Parser.cs

When I write parser. it should show me the methods of class Parser, but it
doesn't works. I don't understand why.
This  happens with an object from any class.

Anyway, thank you for the help.

It has to parse your code to be able to show any information, as long
as some syntax error blocks this, it won't show any information. Just
a missing semicolon ';' may cause that. So be sure your code compiles
ok, before trying to auto-complete.

Hope it helps,
