&gt;<i> I haven't checked out stetic properly but as I understand it this is how 
</I>&gt;<i> it should work:
</I>&gt;<i> All 'graphical' objects should expose certain properties and methods so 
</I>&gt;<i> that the designer merely has to ask the object how to display it 
</I>&gt;<i> ,maximum /minimum size, C# code prototypes etc so that it can be used in 
</I>&gt;<i> the designer. As far as I can tell this is how VStudio works - this 
</I>&gt;<i> means you can use more or less the same designer for Windows or Web 
</I>&gt;<i> forms - *if its not then theres a huge duplication of effort!*
</I>
VStudio don't use the same designer for Win forms and Web forms.
However, they share some common infrastructure. This is possible because
they are based on the same component model (System.ComponentModel.*).
Stetic is implemented in GTK#, which has its own component model, so we
can't even share that infrastructure. Why doesn't GTK# use the same
component model? that's out of the scope of this mailing list, but
summarizing: Win/Web forms were built from scratch over System.Component
model, while GTK was created even before .NET existed. 

&gt;<i> If stetic has used the same methods/properties as used by the 
</I>&gt;<i> Windows.Forms objects then it should be possible to 'point' stetic at 
</I>&gt;<i> the appropriate (Managed.Forms) library and it should be able to work 
</I>&gt;<i> out how to display/edit and code for them - *if its not then theres a 
</I>&gt;<i> huge duplication of effort!
</I>
The world is full of *huge duplication efforts*
(Linux/Windows, .NET/Java, GNOME/KDE, ...), and believe me, most of them
have a good reason to exist.
