<PRE>Hi

I wanted to ask for opinions of developers on how we can integrate 
coding assistance features such as:
- snippets
- autocompletion of expected code - like in the override operator, the 
new operator
- list of overloaded constructors, parameters of functions
- automatic creation of getters/setters, methods. properties, fields, 
events, delegates etc.
- automatic interface/abstract methods implementation
- refactoring?
etc. etc.

Is there a nice and documented architecture which would allow language 
bindings developers to add snippets (that are context based - available 
only in special contexts), and which would allow language bindings to 
tell the source editor when to trigger autocompletion of expected code 
(and what to insert)? Is there a nice paradigm of how to add new code 
assistance functionality in language bindings?

What I need are some hints in how you planned to extend current 
functionality and what is it the current architecture allows. Where 
should I focus my strengths on?

If there are some things lacking in the current architecture, I would be 
glad to help in redesigning it (so that it would allow easy 
extensibility in both language and functionality dimensions). Also, I 
would very much like to see myself document it properly too...
