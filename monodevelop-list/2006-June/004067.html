<PRE>Hello Everyone!
 
I am trying to build MonoDevelop on Windows.  I am having difficulting.
 
If anyone has gotten it to build and run, can you please email this list explaining what you did to get it to work?  I so much want it to run on Windows.
 
I do know Zac Bowling over a year ago got it to work, but it was un-deployable.  Paco got it to work, but he didn't get past the Splash screen.   I heard someone named Tak got it to load up stetic and such.
 
For me,  I have got it to build, but my mono, gtk#, and cygwin environment is like a big junk yard.  It's not something reproducible nor nothing you would want to deploy.  I did get it to run with the splash screen popping, but it eventually fails.
 
I did notice it still uses unix domain sockets even though there is a --ipc-tcp option when running MonoDevelop.  Once you change that to a TCP InterNetwork socket, it runs the splash screen.

The UNMANAGED_DEPENDENCIES_MONO I had earlier was because pkg-config could not find my mono.pc file.  This was resolved by setting PKG_CONFIG_PATH to point where my .pc files are located.  For me this was: 
 
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/cygdrive/g/MonoX-1.1.13.1/lib/pkgconfig

I was able to verify this would work by:
 
pkg-config --cflags --libs mono
 
Thanks,
Daniel

make sure mono is in your PATH

Ignore the mint stuff, it only falls back to that if it can't find mono.
