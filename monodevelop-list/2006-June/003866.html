Is there a way to add it?  Why can't you let developers make their own
choice?  Isn't that part of what Linux and Open Source is about?

I think the fixed container is great for some things and bad for others.
 For example, I wrote a simple, single window Windows.Form app with
Visual Studio a little while ago.  The window is not made to be resized
and the app is only meant for me.  All it does is connect to the
CoastToCoast AM web site with my ID/Password and download the mp3 files
of what show I tell it to.  There are only a few controls/widgets on the
form and so no need to resize it.  It is only ever going to be in one
language.

I started to port the app to Mono/GTK# and the biggest frustration I
have run into is getting the widgets on the window/form without them
resizing.  I don't want a label to resize for this little app.

I use Linux for just about everything at home.  The only stumbling block
I have had so far is finding a productive C# dev environment.  The
.Net/Mono framework is very large.  Too much to remember, so
intellisense/auto-completion is a must for me.  The other part of
programming I don't want to waste too much time on is building the GUI.
 I want to focus on the real code.  Visual Studio is great for building
the GUI.   I hope Monodevelop/Stetic gets to the same level.

Is there a way to add widgets/containers to the Widgets Palette?  If
not, please include *all* widgets/containers that are available in
gtk-sharp.  Please don't try to force developers to work how you _think_
they should work.  IMO Monodevelop is the only Mono/C# IDE under Linux
with promise to allow a developer to be as production as one can be with
Visual Studio.

I am hoping that I will not longer have to run WinXP under VMware to
have a productive C# dev environment.

Jim
