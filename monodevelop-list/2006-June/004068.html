<PRE>&gt;<i> I am trying to build MonoDevelop on Windows.  I am having difficulting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If anyone has gotten it to build and run, can you please email this list
</I>&gt;<i> explaining what you did to get it to work?  I so much want it to run on
</I>&gt;<i> Windows.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do know Zac Bowling over a year ago got it to work, but it was
</I>&gt;<i> un-deployable.  Paco got it to work, but he didn't get past the Splash
</I>&gt;<i> screen.   I heard someone named Tak got it to load up stetic and such.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For me,  I have got it to build, but my mono, gtk#, and cygwin environment
</I>&gt;<i> is like a big junk yard.  It's not something reproducible nor nothing you
</I>&gt;<i> would want to deploy.  I did get it to run with the splash screen popping,
</I>&gt;<i> but it eventually fails.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did notice it still uses unix domain sockets even though there is a
</I>&gt;<i> --ipc-tcp option when running MonoDevelop.  Once you change that to a TCP
</I>&gt;<i> InterNetwork socket, it runs the splash screen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The UNMANAGED_DEPENDENCIES_MONO I had earlier was because pkg-config could
</I>&gt;<i> not find my mono.pc file.  This was resolved by setting PKG_CONFIG_PATH to
</I>&gt;<i> point where my .pc files are located.  For me this was:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> export
</I>&gt;<i> PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/cygdrive/g/MonoX-1.1.13.1/lib/pkgconfig
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was able to verify this would work by:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> pkg-config --cflags --libs mono
</I>
I've gotten it to build, and barely run on win32.  It's not anywhere
near stable or useful yet, let alone deployable.  It will load through
the splash screen, to the main window, allow me to create new projects
and open existing ones (although not edit source or build yet), and
browse the monodocs.  So far, I can not use Stetic, nor the Welcome
Page addin.

I started where you did, with paco's installers for mono/gtk# and
gecko#, as well as the shellter build of evolution-win32.  I built MD
from anonymous svn rev 62063.

I have:
GECKOSHILLA_BASEPATH=C:\Program Files\Common Files\gtkmozembed-win32
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/cygdrive/c/Program
Files/Evolution/bin:/cygdrive/c/mono/MonoX-1.1.13.1/bin:/cygdrive/c/GTK/2.8/bin
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=c:\gtkstuff\lib\pkgconfig:c:\mono\MonoX-1.1.13.1\lib\pkgconfig

I temporarily disabled the code in
Core/src/MonoDevelop.Ide/MonoDevelop.Ide.Gui/IdeStartup.cs that checks
for/reconnects to existing instances (UNIX sockets), temporarily
removed the Stetic (MonoDevelop.GtkCore) and WelcomePage addins (from
build/AddIns), and ran with --ipc-tcp.

I hope some of this is helpful.
