<PRE>Hi

I am trying to change the system time/date on Ubuntu operating system from
c# code. I am using MonoDevelop Complier.

My end user should never see the operating system (FluxBox) nor will they be
provided the passwords for the system so I must build my own control to
adjust the time/date.

I am very stuck and have been on google and trying various things for weeks
and I worry now that I am not going to find a solution without help

I have seen two methods and I cannot implement them

I have tried the following.

System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(&#8220;Sudo date 031212001986&#8221;);

This fails because it cannot find a TTY or password. 

I have also tried to use DLL import on Kernel32.dll, Enter point =
&#8220;SetLocalTime&#8221;. This just totally fails as it cannot find the Entry point
(All though it loads the DLL). I guess this method has been intended for C#
on windows.

I have tried quite a few variations and I am just totally stuck/confused. I
really need to ability to change the system clock without the user knowing
passwords and having excess to the operating system.

Any method will do, I couldn&#8217;t care if its 1000 lines of code or 2 lines. I
just really need to adjust this clock and date urgently.
