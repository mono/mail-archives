<PRE>   I would like to know does monodevelop work with nunit? I tried to download
the latest version of ServiceStack.Text source code
<A HREF="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Text.git">https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Text.git</A> compiled them and ran
unit tests. At first, I get an error in monodevelop complying about
DtoAttribute. It could not load this attribute and did not show all tests in
browser despite of availability of this attribute in compiled assemblies.  I
commented out the attribute in one test and the list of tests loaded and I
ran the tests. Most of them were failed (I ran on the linux box with mono
2.10.8 installed). 
  Then I moved to windows, compile the project under Visual Studio and under
Monodevelop. After VS compilation all tests have passed in NUnit. After
monodevelop compilation most of tests were failed similar to linux box (the
target in MD was MS NET -&gt; Mono/.NET 4).
  Also I wrote my own test and it showed very strange behaviour. If I ran
the test under MD it has passed. If I ran the test under Visual Studio it
has failed (that was the correct behaviour). If I ran the same code like
Console App in MD it has failed too.  I don't know what is the magic here,
just think that NUnit and monodevelop does not work correctly together. I
can provide the code which properly failed in VS and erroneously passed in
MD if needed. But you can see strange behaviour without the code of mine,
just try to run ServiceStack.Text tests under MD.

Tried in monodevelop 2.8.6.3 (ubuntu linux, mono 2.10.8.1, nunit 2.5.10)
and monodevelop 3.0.4.6 (windows, ms .net 4.0, nunit 2.6)
