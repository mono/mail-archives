<PRE>Hi Michael et al,

&gt;<i> I'm seeking feedback on a proposal to change the locations in which
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop stores data. This affects all users, so please have your
</I>&gt;<i> say!
</I>

I had an application that I initially wrote for linux only and I had to
make it support Windows (how backwards is that?!?)  Anyway, the first
thing I figured out is that cross platform applications should not use
GConf.  You are already there so no problem there.  I would suggest
Elektra <A HREF="http://elektra.g4ii.com/Main_Page">http://elektra.g4ii.com/Main_Page</A>  instead of sqllite if you are
looking for alternatives.

My real point though, is that this problem should be solved for more
applications than just MonoDevelop.  Obviously, some things are out of
scope, but I believe that MonoDevelop is helping application developers
write cross platform applications and whatever solution we come up with
should make sense for all the cross platform apps that have config data.

Your decision will most likely impact other projects so if we can have a
mono.AppConfig (or whatever) that all applications can reuse that would
be helpful.

Ideally other things that you guys have done to port MonoDevelop to
Windows and Mac get pushed either into Gtk# or some other place that we
can all reuse.  Sorry to sound like such a moocher.


Thanks,

Vlad
