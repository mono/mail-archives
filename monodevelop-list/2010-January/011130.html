<PRE>Hi

&gt;<i> If you are saying that the SharpDevelop designer uses P/Invoke (DLLImport)
</I>&gt;<i> to access unmanaged libraries then I agree, porting the SharpDevelop
</I>&gt;<i> designer to MonoDevelop may be the wrong approach.  I would very much like
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop to stay dedicated to being cross-platform.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
No p/invokes are used for the designer :)

&gt;<i> If what you are saying is that the SharpDevelop designer relies on .NET
</I>&gt;<i> classes which are incomplete in Mono currently then I do not see why this
</I>&gt;<i> has to shoot down the idea of a designer in MonoDevelop so quickly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I imagine that a good number of the people asking for or expecting to find a
</I>&gt;<i> forms designer in MonoDevelop are currently on the Windows platform. 
</I>&gt;<i> Running only on Windows for the moment would still be useful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If I get some free time one of these days I could try to run the stand-alone
</I>&gt;<i> designer on .NET to get an indication of how well it works when the platform
</I>&gt;<i> support is there.  I could also poke around the designer in SharpDevelop to
</I>&gt;<i> see how easily it might be ripped out.  I just thought somebody more
</I>&gt;<i> knowlegable, like Mike perhaps, might be able to quickly tell me if breaking
</I>&gt;<i> the problem in two like this would actually make anything easier.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Ripping out the forms designer shouldn't be that hard at all (in fact
it's 'just' ripping out some services which should be provided) -
integrating it into monodevelop ... is a lot of work, but doable.

Regards
Mike
