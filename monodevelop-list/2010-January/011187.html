Hm, maybe MD trunk can only be opened by MD trunk. I'm note quite sure
what change introduced this problem, but it must have been fairly
recent. If you could file a bug that would be great.

You can safely ignore that.

&gt;<i> After that I encountered a problem building GnomePlatform.cs where it

You should switch to the DebugMac configuration. It includes the Mac
platform addin, and excludes the Windows and Gnome platform addins.

&gt;<i> Then I encountered the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Building: MonoDevelop.Refactoring (Debug)
</I>&gt;<i> Building MonoDevelop.Refactoring
</I>&gt;<i> make: *** No rule to make target `all'. &#160;Stop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Eventually I just disabled makefile integration on that project and

</I>&gt;<i> The same happened for&#160;Building: MonoDevelop.HexEditor and I solved in the
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;same way (disabled makefile integration).
</I>&gt;<i> Then it ran.
</I>
Oops, those should not have been set to use makefiles for building,
only for syncing file/ref lists. Fixed in SVN.

FYI there is a page on the wiki with info about the Mac build process:
