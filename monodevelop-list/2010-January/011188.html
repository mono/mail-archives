<PRE>Thanks. I should have found the config and the doc. That makes life easier. Bug filed <A HREF="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=574595">https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=574595</A> I did confirm that the trunk version of MD was able to load the solution in spite of the policy setting.

I tried MacDebug and found MonoDevelop.GnomePlatform is still included in the solution config. Excluding it worked fine.

You guys are doing a fantastic job. I haven't tried out MD in approximately two years, it has come a long way. A real pleasure to use. I hope the perf will remain so great as new features are added. That is one area where VS falls on its face.
