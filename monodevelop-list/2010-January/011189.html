Hm, it certainly wasn't before, not sure how it got changed. It could
have been broken for ages, since I mostly use Makefiles to build MD.
Maybe caused by a sln loader bug and a careless commit? Anyway, fixed
in SVN.

&gt;<i> You guys are doing a fantastic job. I haven't tried out MD in approximately two years, it has come a long way. A real pleasure to use. I hope the perf will remain so great as new features are added. That is one area where VS falls on its face.
</I>
Glad you like it! We've certainly made good progress in the past two
years - I think we're coming up for the 2-year anniversary of MD 1.0,
and the difference between 1.0 and 2.2 is immense.
