Hi,

I'm new to Mono but I've worked with Visual Studio for a few years in
Windows.  I'd like to find a FOSS application that uses MonoDevelop so I can
see how it does things because for me I learn best by example.  I went
through SourceForge and a few other FOSS sites, but I couldn't find any
simple way to search for applications written with MonoDevelop.

Any suggestions?  I'm downloading F-Spot now, but I've read there's no
solution for MonoDevelop since it wasn't written using MD.  

Thanks -

Sam
