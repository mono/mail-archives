</I>&gt;<i> files are associated with a helper VisualStudio-Version auto-selector
</I>&gt;<i> application).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Said that, I don't think MD needs to support multiple released
</I>&gt;<i> versions installed side-by-side, but it would be nice if a development
</I>&gt;<i> (or preview/beta release), could be installed to another prefix and
</I>&gt;<i> could take it in account to keep per-user data in a separate root:

</I>&gt;<i> For instance a development build installed to \usr\local prefix could

</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelopPreview instead of MonoDevelop, for non-release builds.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That would allow to also concoct tests for configuration migration
</I>&gt;<i> between versions of MD and of independently released addins, even
</I>&gt;<i> after your proposed wholesale migration.
</I>&gt;<i>

One easy way to do this would be like Firefox and even Visual Studio 
does it, is a &quot;profile&quot;. You can start it with --profile &quot;profilename&quot; 
and it uses a different directory store the settings (and plugin cache).
