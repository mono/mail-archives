<PRE>I was able to get this working just ran into a copule issues that I was able to workaround. Just including the info for others...

I had a problem opening /main/Main.sln in MonoDevelop due to line 1072 that has content &quot;Policies = $0&quot;. Removing that line allowed the solution to load. There was still a problem complaining about not being able to load the &quot;po&quot; project because its type - &quot;TranslationProject&quot; - was unknown.

After that I encountered a problem building GnomePlatform.cs where it couldn't find the Gnome namespace. Neither could I so I disabled the project as part of the build.

Then I encountered the following:
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Building: MonoDevelop.Refactoring (Debug)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Building MonoDevelop.Refactoring
</I>&gt;<i> make: *** No rule to make target `all'.  Stop.
</I>
Eventually I just disabled makefile integration on that project and continued...

The same happened for Building: MonoDevelop.HexEditor and I solved in the  same way (disabled makefile integration).

Then it ran.
