<PRE>I believe the problem will be the fact of sharpedevelop/VS wrap native
code to provide winforms designer and so if this is implemented in
monodevelop how this will live with other os than MS one ?

2010/1/20 jmalcolm &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monodevelop-list">malcolm.justin at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mike, thank you for clarifying that the real work is in building in the
</I>&gt;<i> designer classes to Mono's Windows Forms support rather than on the forms
</I>&gt;<i> designer itself. &#160;I have a question about this though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The MonoDevelop binaries distributed for Windows run on top of Microsoft's
</I>&gt;<i> .NET 3.5 implementation. &#160;Mono is not required to be installed and I do not
</I>&gt;<i> believe that MonoDevelop would not use it even if it was. &#160;The
</I>&gt;<i> multi-targeting ability of MonoDevelop means that applications can be
</I>&gt;<i> developed on top of Mono using MonoDevelop of course but MonoDevelop itself
</I>&gt;<i> does not rely on Mono unless you go to the effort of explicitly building it
</I>&gt;<i> on Mono from source.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, these designer classes that we are talking about are available to
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop on Windows today. &#160;MonoDevelop is running on top of the same
</I>&gt;<i> implementation that powers the SharpDevelop forms designer and I assume the
</I>&gt;<i> Visual Studio one as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How much work would it be to port the SharpDevelop designer to MonoDevelop
</I>&gt;<i> if it was a Windows only feature? &#160;Alternatively, how well would the
</I>&gt;<i> existing stand-alone designer work on the real .NET and how much work would
</I>&gt;<i> it be to integrate it into MonoDevelop? &#160;Would this be a better route than
</I>&gt;<i> porting from SharpDevelop?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are people against the idea of a Windows only feature in MonoDevelop?* Are
</I>&gt;<i> we worried about somehow undermining GTK#?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems common to see questions like &quot;I started my project on Visual Studio
</I>&gt;<i> and would like to move to MonoDevelop. &#160;How do I get the forms designer to
</I>&gt;<i> work?&quot; &#160;My intuition is that many Windows developers interested in Mono or a
</I>&gt;<i> cross-platform future start off this way. &#160;Many seem to misunderstand that
</I>&gt;<i> the lack of a forms designer does not mean that their projects will not
</I>&gt;<i> build or run on Mono. &#160;I suspect that many would-be MonoDevelop/Mono users
</I>&gt;<i> go away with the impression that MonoDevelop or Mono are just too immature
</I>&gt;<i> to use at this point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps the lack of a forms designer is interfering more than we suspect
</I>&gt;<i> with the goal of attracting Windows developers to Mono, MonoDevelop, or even
</I>&gt;<i> ultimately to Linux.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps a working forms designer on Windows would create more interest in
</I>&gt;<i> advancing the state of the designer classes in Mono itself and bringing the
</I>&gt;<i> forms designer to Linux, Solaris, and Mac. &#160;These contributors might even be
</I>&gt;<i> those that Mono/MonoDevelop fails to attract today.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps not of course.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am certainly not questioning the priorities of the MonoDevelop project**.
</I>&gt;<i> I respect that there may be bigger fish to fry. &#160;That said, I do believe
</I>&gt;<i> that a forms designer in MonoDevelop would be &#160;a great boon and wonder how
</I>&gt;<i> big a project it would be if finishing the designer support classes in Mono
</I>&gt;<i> itself was not a prerequisite.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Long post I know. &#160;My apologies for that. &#160;And kudos to everyone working on
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop. &#160;I really enjoy and appreciate your efforts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Justin
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * The debugger options in the Windows version of MonoDevelop are already
</I>&gt;<i> different I believe.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ** For what it is worth... The majority of my work in MonoDevelop is ASP.NET
</I>&gt;<i> deployed to Linux servers so I appreciate that there are other priorities.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I wrote my first GTK apps for Linux before I ever made a GUI app for
</I>&gt;<i> Windows and I do like GTK#. &#160;Interestingly though, the first app I ever
</I>&gt;<i> tried to write in MonoDevelop used Windows Forms. &#160;I really wanted to have a
</I>&gt;<i> single cross-platform executable with no installer so GTK# was not an
</I>&gt;<i> option. &#160;I ended up discovering SharpDevelop and installed Windows on a
</I>&gt;<i> laptop just to use it. &#160;I tried to come back to MonoDevelop but after a
</I>&gt;<i> while I found myself using SharpDevelop almost exclusively (even for my
</I>&gt;<i> ASP.NET and console projects). &#160;My preference for Linux eventually brought
</I>&gt;<i> me back to MonoDevelop and now I use it even when in Windows. &#160;I still have
</I>&gt;<i> to keep SharpDevelop around just to design the odd form (and TurtleSVN too).
</I>&gt;<i> I would rather stick with MonoDevelop with Subversion built-in. &#160;I find that
</I>&gt;<i> doing GTK# GUI in code is not so bad but I would never do a Windows Forms
</I>&gt;<i> layout without a designer.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> That's sad...sorry for the ignorance, but how much work it is to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> integrate the current mwf-designer stand alone app?, beside as far as I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> know, sharpdevelop it have one, I know that it probably use .Net
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> services and clases that don't exist in mono or are not complete, but
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> each mono release is more feature compatible with .Net, so may be is not
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to much. I also know that if you think in a really feature complete,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> stable, etc mwf-designer comparable with the VS.NET one is probably a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> big task, but may be is more doable to think in a &quot;basic&quot; one, that it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> can be even unstable (sorry, but we are all use to have unstable
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;features&quot; in MD, come on, what feature in MD it wait to be really
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> mature to be included?). That can bring the attention and jump from
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> there...I can even offer my help if some of the MD gurus and hopefully
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the mwf-designer developer can give me a hand...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ok, my 2 cents (btw. I wrote the SharpDevelop forms designer):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The SharpDevelop forms designer uses the windows.forms built-in forms
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> designer infrastructure - that said it's not possible to translate it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1:1 to mono - even if the mono windows forms implementation is good -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the designer infrastructure is something different.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Doing a forms designer from &quot;outside&quot; without the help of the framework
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is almost not possible (we've tried that with sharpdevelop first) ... so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementing a forms designer for monodevelop would require much work on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the mono windows forms implementation first (lluis already mentioned
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that). And believe me - this is *MUCH* work (but it's doable :)).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I understand the need for a windows forms designer and I hope that we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> get one contributed by someone who has the time &amp; patience to implement
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it. It's an open source project - we would like more people contributing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Personally I would like to see some improvements in stetic. Stetic could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really need some love. Our current shedule for the next release doesn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> include badly needed stetic improvements :(
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Regards
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mike
