<PRE>
Michael, thank you very much.

The key part of your answer is that I needed MonoDevelop from SVN.  The
source tarballs from on monodevelop.com do not contain the Visual Studio
solution or project files as far as I can tell.

I can answer your questions, and I have a related question now.

</I>
The link you provided links the &quot;hidden&quot; Mono libraries as well.  No need to
look it up.

&gt;&gt;<i> Alternatively, is it possible to build MonoDevelop in VisualStudio or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SharpDevelop?&#160; If so, does it really need .NET 3.5 or can I build it in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2.0?
</I>
&gt;<i> It needs 3.5, because it uses C# 3 quite a bit.
</I>
Ok, but Mono should handle all the C# 3 stuff no problem right?

&gt;&gt;<i> I have MonoDevelop 2.2 beta 2 running on a Windows 2000 system that does
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support .NET 3.5.&#160; I also have Mono 2.4.3.1 on this system and would like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> build MonoDevelop to run on top of Mono instead of .NET.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am currently running the MonoDevelop build for .NET 3.5 on top of .NET
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2.0
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the Mono System.Core.dll (in the MonoDevelop directory).&#160; This works
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but I would really rather build MonoDevelop on top of Mono instead.
</I>
&gt;<i>Any particular reason? We only &quot;officially&quot; have installers for MD on
</I>&gt;<i>Windows using .NET, because that's a much smaller dependency than Mono
</I>&gt;<i>for most people (because they have .NET already).
</I>
The decision makes sense.  Unfortunately, .NET 3.5 is not available for my
system (Windows 2000) so it is an impossible dependency for me.  I am
getting around this by placing the System.Core.dll from Mono in the
MonoDevelop directory and running MonoDevelop on .NET 2.0.  To do this
though, I have to first install MonoDevelop on another computer and then
move the MonoDevelop folder over manually.  I would much prefer to build
MonoDevelop from source relying on Mono only.

&gt;<i>Note that you can still *target* Mono despite running on .NET, using
</I>&gt;<i>MD's parallel runtimes support - and, I imagine you could build MD
</I>&gt;<i>using itself targeting Mono.
</I>
It is exactly this capability that I am trying to use.  MonoDevelop is the
only IDE that will run on my system that will allow me to compile a project
that uses C# 3.0 language features.

So, I loaded up MonoDevelop, loaded main/Main.sln as discussed in your link,
chose the DebugWin32 profile and tried to build the project.

I had to build Mono.Addins 0.4 first and there were some Mono.Cairo cast
complaints.  It seemed as though different versions of Mono.Cairo were
getting referenced in different places.  I sorted that out and the project
seemed to build without errors.  The main/build/bin directory now has a
bunch of nice dll and exe files.

Unfortunately, when I run &quot;mono MonoDevelop.exe&quot; I just get my cursor back.

Looking at the warnings in MonoDevelop I see a bunch of lines that look
similar to this:

gtk-gui\gui-stetic: Could not generate code for widgets of type: XXXXXX. The
widget could not be found in any referenced library.  The generated code may
be invalid.

Any idea what is going on there?

Thanks.

Justin
