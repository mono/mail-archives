Try removing and re-adding the references to glib-sharp, gtk-sharp, etc.
MD only recently (iirc) got the ability to load references by name, as
opposed to by exact assembly version, so if you have references to gtk#
2.6.0.0 assembly versions, and try to compile with only 2.8.0.0, it
would fail. This is the most common source of errors like this.
