I definitely agree that we could add some more buttons to make it more
useful, and make it take less vertical space. Right now I hide it,
because I just don't find it useful.

&gt;<i> XCode has a very nice 'quick finder' - see the screenshots in:

</I>&gt;<i> What I find nice is that it merges the 'notebook' and the class quick

I would be strongly against making the file-combo change right now,
for a number of reasons:

* Tabs are very familiar to our users and users of most other IDEs,
and also very familiar to any new user who's used a modern web
browser.

* Tabs can be re-ordered, and potentially dragged off and re-docked at
the side, or left floating on another monitor. None of these are
possible with the combobox.

* Having a list of all open files is useful - for example, you can see
at a glance which files are dirty.

* MD uses a dock/pad workspace model like VS, Xcode uses a
floating-window workspace model, so for Xcode a window represents a
single document, and the combo is a way to switch the document.
Because the workspace models are different, workspace-related things
like this may not transfer over easily and still be usable.

Perhaps we can figure out a way to make it work well in MD, but I
think we have many other priorities that would be more useful to our
users.
