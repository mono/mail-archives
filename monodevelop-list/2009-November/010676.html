</I>&gt;<i> files I want to open, and I regularly forget to uncheck the 'Close

This is an issue that comes up from time to time, and one we'd like to
fix, but it's nontrivial to fully support opening multiple MD windows,
because we need to make sure that all settings and project etc. are
synced between the MD instances. Opening unrelated projects in a
workspaces is a hack IMO, which is probably why it's off by default.
