<PRE>
how did u get that info?
changing PKG_CONFIG_PATH doesn't affect monodevelop in anyway, try it urself
I don't think I was clear in my first post although I tried as hard as
possible, I'll explain again:

- change default .NET runtime in MonoDevelop to &quot;Mono Trunk&quot; which has the
prefix /usr/local, now under &quot;Packages&quot; tab when editing references
MonoDevelop can't see the packs installed from rpms which are installed with
the prefix /usr but does see the packages installed from source which have
the prefix /usr/local

- change the default .NET runtime in MonoDevelop to &quot;Mono 141701 (/usr)&quot;
which has the prefix /usr, now under &quot;Packages&quot; tab when editing references
MonoDevelop can't see the packs installed from svn sources which have the
prefix /usr/local but does see the packages installed from rpm which have
the prefix /usr

anyway, for my specific situation, I wanted monodevelop to see gtk-sharp
which is installed from rpms and be able to use it with my own mono that's
compiled from svn source &quot;Trunk&quot;, I wanted so because I thought compiling
gtk-sharp from source takes a lot of time beacause of its dependencies, it
turns out that I was idiot, compiling gtk-sharp doesn't need dependencies
because they were already installed when I installed gtk-sharp from rpms and
my mono (in /usr/local) can use these dependencies so I just got gtk-sharp
from svn sources, compiled and installed and now I have MonoDevelop using
trunk mono and gtk-sharp

what's very confusing is that MonoDevelop can see the wnck-sharp package
which is installed from rpms in /usr although I'm selecting &quot;Trunk&quot; mono
(/usr/local) as the default .NET runtime, why can MonoDevelop see this
package and not see others, I dont' know, and I checked /usr/lib/mono/gac
and it does contain wnck-sharp and checked /usr/local/lib/mono/gac and it
DOESN'T contain wnck-sharp AND running /usr/local/bin/gacutil -l doesn't
list wnck-sharp just like it doesn't list all other packages that are
installed from rpms to /usr

shit, I think I wasted a lot of ur time if u read all that, I just wanted to
be very clear and make the issue very detailed.
