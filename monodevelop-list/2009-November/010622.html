</I>&gt;<i> server are known to work in both Microsoft and Mono environments. As a
</I>&gt;<i> plus the community version of MySQL can be had for no cost, or if you
</I>&gt;<i> need business support a commercial version is also available.
</I>First of all, I suggest what Gonzalo did in his mail - do some research before ill-advising somebody 
and spreading misinformation.

In addition to what Gonzalo pointed out (the google search), there is also a pure C# port of SQLite 
(<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/csharp-sqlite/">http://code.google.com/p/csharp-sqlite/</A>).

As for recommending MySQL... I beg to differ - MySQL is not the only and not the best (IMHO) choice 
out there for .NET developers on any platform. One problem with MySQL provider for .NET is not 
really technical, but is never the less important - the connector is GPL-ed, so if your plan is to 
use it for a closed-source application which you want to sell (or even just provide in binary-only 
form) then you will either need to purchase commercial license from MySQL, open your code or resort 
to various tricks to circumvent GPL. Much better choice, as somebody else suggested, is PostgreSQL - 
  its .NET driver (Npgsql) is LGPL, has all the features you mentioned (membership, profile, role) 
and is shipped with Mono. Also, in my personal opinion, PostgreSQL offers much higher quality 
product (reliability, advanced features, security) than MySQL.
