Couple things:

Some of the Exceptions seem to have tabbing issues.

Your makefile is basically broken.

#1) It wont copy the .addin.xml if it is changed.
#2) It is not isolated from potential future layout changes
#3) Any change in the .addin.xml that is deployed will force a rebuild
of the assembly.
#4) You use /pkg and a set of packages, you should be using the
variables that the configure.in script detects for those for you.

You should look at many of the example makefiles, that have all of these
things fixed.

What is the future plan for supporting/enhancing/finishing this addin?

For example, you use the MonoDevelop TreeView wrapper, which is a piece
of code I am hoping to remove at some point soon. And I noticed
many //FIXME/TODO type comments in the patch.

As far as committing this to the repository, You can speak to me either
over email or on irc about your plans for support/etc and once that is
resolved, commit as is, and patch the above mentioned issues.
