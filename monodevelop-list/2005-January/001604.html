<PRE>People:

While building MD I got an error that gtk-sharp was not found when I
knew for sure it was installed.

The error happened in Core/src/MonoDevelop.Base.

The error was gecko-sharp not being able to find that assembly.

Remembering that gecko-sharp was installed from an rpm and it was
likely to be looking for the assemblies in the wrong place, I did the
following:

1) rpm -e'd gecko-sharp rpm
2) Installed gecko-sharp from sources with the prefix that I have been
using all along (/usr)
3) Now MD makes and installs successfully, some warnings about
deprecated apis but successful nevertheless.

Thanks for the help. I can go ahead and mess around with the add-in.
