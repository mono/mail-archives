<PRE>Guys:

I am trying to install mono + monodevelop from sources on my FC 3. I
am following this:

<A HREF="http://webpages.charter.net/mdeggers/howto-mono-fedora.html">http://webpages.charter.net/mdeggers/howto-mono-fedora.html</A>

My FC3 was installed as a &quot;Workstation&quot; (development packages + admin
tools). I added svn. ***nothing else has been done to the distro****

I am following the *order* that this page suggests.

Everything goes well until I tried to install gecko-sharp.

I got the sources and the patch from Debian and aplplied the patch:
&quot;patch -p0 &lt; ....&quot;

Configure fails with the following message: gtk-sharp package was not found=
.

According to the order suggested gtk-sharp should come later.

I decided to go ahead and get gtk-sharp from svn.

&quot;autogen.sh --prefix=3D/usr&quot; for gtk-sharp goes well but
***gnome-sharp.dll*** is not included.

At this pont, I did not want to continue because gnome-sharp.dll is
needed later.

The FC3 libgnome packages (2.80.XXX) are installed.

Where am i missing the step?

Any help would be highly appreciated!!
