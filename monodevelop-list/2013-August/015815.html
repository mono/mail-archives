<PRE>I assume it is OK to post recruiting messages to the list. See below for
the details, but as a quick summary: We are actively hiring. Our primary
development platform is mono + monodevelop. We are located in Boston with
presence in New York and San Francisco. We are looking for full time
employees, not contract hires. Please feel free to reply directly to me if
you are interested or have questions.

Matt
