Hi,

Pardon my ignorance of Linux's history and culture, I noticed early days of
Ubuntu, mono was shipped with the distro. Then I read (forgetting which
version) that Mono was not part of packages being shipped

Why is such strong hatred even though the original work was done by MS but
Mono was built from the ECMA/ISO standard. Linux seems to embrace a
proprietary software platform (Java) a lot more warmly than CLR, which is an
open standard platform.

All your contributions and suggestions are very educational from someone new
to Linux culture. I have just switched over to Mint-15 (Cinnamon) and loving
its UI and won't be moving to other distro just to get MD4.

Several things I am always edgy of using things from PPA which stems from
years developing in Windows world:
1) How can one be sure things from PPA use all the correct platform
supporting modules?
2) How can one be sure if the PPA builder has not tempered with build
settings to get things to build - ending up with using &quot;It-works-here&quot;
yardstick? As a result a distribution from one PPA may not be the same as
one from another PPA.
3) What extend of the testing these PPA has done compared to say a vendor of
the software, e.g Xamarin? I know it is still the prefer modus operandi of
Linux to build everything from source for anything.
4) Finally, not suggesting it has happened, how trustworthy are things from
PPA that it does not introduce back doors or nasties? One of the great
features in CLR is the strong name assembly to prevent tempering.

Thanks.

MarL
