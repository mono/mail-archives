<PRE>Hi everyone,

I've been trying to install mono 1.2.4 and monodevelop 0.14 since last week
and it's a been a nightmare. I need the lastest version to import a Visual
Studio 2005 project in Linux (Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper Drake using Gnome as my
window manager). First, i download the installer from mono-project, but the
monodoc and monodevelop icons didn't seem to launch any exe.  After looking
for a while, i uninstalled everything and decided to start from strach with
the sources from the svn repositories. I install mono 1.2.4 without any prob
but then it got complicated for monodevelop with all the depencies and etc.

For each depency, i use those commands:

                  ./configure or bootstrap&lt;version&gt; --prefix='pkg-config
--variable=prefix mono' which is euivalent to /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/../..
                   make
                   make install

After several hours, monodevelop seem to be install on my system. But when i
tried to launch the IDE i got the followings warnings and exceptions.

After looking in the mailing list, the replyers said the problem seem to be
with the old assemblies or something like that but i didn't have any old
version of monodevelop thus those assemblies.

Any help would be really appreciated.
