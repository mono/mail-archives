<PRE>I am no attacking any of you personally or blaming!  I am posing some 
fundamental questions here.  It never ceases to amaze me how programmers 
get all sensitive when it comes to really constructive criticism!  Do 
you work on MonoDevelop for yourself or for others AND yourself?

What is the point in putting in all of the sweat time you have if it is 
a massive pain to use your software by everyone else!  In fact, after an 
install you can't even use it AT ALL!!!  This is 2007!  hehe  As spock 
says.. the needs of the many far out weight the needs of the one.  Why 
develop something that always has problems loading after someone 
installs it?  Does it not make more sense to ensure the quality of 
deployment before a massive list of features?

I think your work is excellent.  I write software professionally and 
have for many years.  I used to work on a certain C++ compiler in 
Redmond a long time ago so I am not a newby to coding.  But nothing is 
more irritating or a let down to get all up and excited about somebody's 
work like yours and then have something go wrong and not have a 
workaround that is easily available.

Thanks,
Allan
