&gt;<i> The irony is... the best technology and productivity will probably come 
</I>&gt;<i> from mono but the team does not do enough to on board newbies when they 
</I>&gt;<i> start.  
</I>
Mails like this are really irritating. I've been working on MonoDevelop
for more than two years now, doing my best to make MD useful, stable and
easy to use, and I spent many hours of my free time on it. You say
that's not enough? sorry, I'll try to do it better in my next life.

&gt;<i> I installed .12 from synaptic in ubuntu because my .13 install 
</I>&gt;<i> would not start mono.  I get the MOZILLA_HOME_FIVE issue.  When I went 
</I>&gt;<i> to start the .12 monodevelop it would not start.  For some odd reason I 
</I>&gt;<i> can start it from a root console.
</I>
If you installed a package from a distro and it doesn't work at all, go
complain the disto.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Where is the
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1 - step by step installation list
</I>&gt;<i> 2 - log of problems you can encounter and how to fix them when you do 
</I>&gt;<i> after the install of a mono distribution?
</I>
Waiting for somebody to write it.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Am I just missing information?
</I>
You are missing that this is an open source project. The core
development team is very small and can't do everything. I'm tired of
asking the community to contribute tutorials and guides. Nobody has yet
written one that can help you. Sorry about that, but please don't blame
the development team.

Lluis.
