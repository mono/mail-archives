<PRE>Hello,

I've just compiled MD from svn (rev 81588) which worked perfectly fine,
but now I can not run it due to the well known &quot;application not found:
IDE&quot; exception.

So I deleted ~/.config/MonoDevelop and ran mdtool setup reg-build and it
complains that it can not parse several addin.xml files:

How can I fix this, does this have anything to do that I have two
versions of MD installed (0.14 and svn)?
  (Btw. this is no file access error, the user that I run MD under own
every file and they also belong to the users group at my machine so MD
is able to read them)

Any help will be appreciated and thanks in advance.

Kind Regards,
Valentin S.
