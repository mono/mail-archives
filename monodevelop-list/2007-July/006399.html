As far as containers go, I am puzzling over how one does a background 
spanning a collection of containers. For example in my Delphi app I have 
an &quot;about&quot; window which contains a TImage component on top of which I 
place the needed labels and a button. The TImage provides a background 
graphic for the window. How does one do this with GTK# ?

Thanks for the tip.  I'm running Gentoo and installed by portage. It 
appears this only gets you the binaries, so had to get sources separately.
I was googling around for some intermediate code, specific to Stetic 
use, but there is practically nothing beyond some console output &quot;hello 
world&quot; examples and simple runtime add widget code. Not of much help to 
a Stetic user.
