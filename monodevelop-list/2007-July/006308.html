ok

I'll make sure this works and fix it if it doesn't, thanks for pointing
this out :)

&gt;<i>       * About &quot;FIXME: figure out which of the commands to run based on

</I>
awesome, I was wondering about this as I was kayaking Saturday
morning ;)

&gt;<i>       * DispatchCommandFromAccel is probably not needed anymore.
</I>
Nod, altho it may be needed for commands which require a data item? From
what I could tell, we don't seem to have any of those type commands with
assigned key bindings currently, they all seem to simply have the 1-#
shortcuts once their sub-menu is opened... but I'm not 100% positive on
that ;)
