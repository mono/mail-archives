<PRE>Hello Rafael,

Thank you for your response.

</I>&gt;<i> They have both, AFAIR, so you need to use the right one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Admittedly I did try other versions because it wasn't loading into the 
toolbox, but the gtk version is the nplot-gtk-0.9.9.2.tar 
&lt;<A HREF="http://netcontrols.org/nplot/downloads/nplot-gtk-0.9.9.2.tar">http://netcontrols.org/nplot/downloads/nplot-gtk-0.9.9.2.tar</A>&gt; which can 
be gotten here: 
<A HREF="http://netcontrols.org/nplot/wiki/index.php?n=Main.DownloadArea">http://netcontrols.org/nplot/wiki/index.php?n=Main.DownloadArea</A> among 
other locations, and this one also does not load. I assume you are 
supposed to select the .dll file to load the widget, thou I have to say 
that it is kind of strange to me to use dlls in a Linux environment.

&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Google a bit to know each technology a little more. Work on a WinForms
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; designer for MD is underway, but even when it gets ready you will need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to choose between one or the other, per application/project.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Coming from Delphi programming, I admittedly now little about the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mono/MonoDevelop environment, so pardon my ignorance. My end goal is to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have an application that can be compiled for Windows as well as Linux.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If I write the program with MonoDevelop/GTK# under Linux, what will I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need to do to get a windows executable?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's GTK# for windows (but beware of versions), so if you develop
</I>&gt;<i> with the goal of having it cross-platform, you certainly, can do that
</I>&gt;<i> with MonoDevelop/GTK#. You can also develop with SharpDevelop(or
</I>&gt;<i> VS.NET)/WinForms in Windows, and it will work on Mono/Linux. What we
</I>&gt;<i> don't have is a cross-platform IDE, and as I said MonoDevelop,
</I>&gt;<i> currently doesn't have an WinForms designer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Will I need to install MonoDevelop under windows?
</I>&gt;<i> You can't do that. Although MonoDevelop was born as a fork of
</I>&gt;<i> SharpDevelop, substituting GTK# for WinForms, it is plainly an example
</I>&gt;<i> of a GTK# sharp app that isn't cross-platform because it depends on
</I>&gt;<i> many other things that are Linux-specific.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Will I be able to compile the GTK# code under windows?
</I>&gt;<i> You don't need to, because you can use the same binaries (with the
</I>&gt;<i> GTK# libs correctly installed for the platform), but yes you can also
</I>&gt;<i> recompile on any platform, where you have corresponding versions of
</I>&gt;<i> Mono ou .NET.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any pointers on writing cross-platform code with Mono/MonoDevelop would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be welcome.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The first page of googling &quot;mono cross-platform&quot; presents some
</I>&gt;<i> articles and even a book, on the subject. Google &quot;mono cross-platform
</I>&gt;<i> gtk#&quot; for some more specific material.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also our wiki is the main reference on all things Mono, including GTK#:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page">http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/GtkSharp">http://www.mono-project.com/GtkSharp</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Guidelines:Application_Portability">http://www.mono-project.com/Guidelines:Application_Portability</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, I have looked at these pages, but these don't answer all my 
questions. I guess a certain level of knowledge is assumed. For example
, I know that C#(a C++ copy as I see it) is a Microsoft created language 
and is used in .net, and also that C# is mentioned in mono 
documentation. Then there is GTK# which is a wrapper for GTK+, which 
uses C/C++. The thing is I don't actually see it saying anywhere what 
language GTK# uses. I deduce it must be C#. Is this correct?


Thanks,
George
