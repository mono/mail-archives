<PRE>Lluis,

As soon as I get to my cubicle this next monday I wiill send you a Mono
Beginners Guide using Monodevelop that I write. This guide don't include any
information to install MD assuming that you have a running Mono &amp; MD.

I think that someone should develop a installer like the Mono installer. Or
even better a &quot;hole enchillada&quot; installer with Mono and MD. Because some
times our distros take a while to have the newest releases.  Probably you may
ask why in the heaven I don't offer myself to do it. The answer is really
simple I'm not skilled enough to accomplish that task. However I really push
my self to learn faster and help others to start their own open source
experience. I use my limited Linux's skills to help others and to contribute
to this and other open source projects.

Allan,
Open source is not for every body. No pain no FOSS. The other option is the
commercial support for FOSS. All those roadblocks in open source are the
building blocks of the expertice you may use to help others in the future. My
recommendation is you to don't give up. A &quot;non written&quot; rule of the
FOSS's &quot;constructive criticism&quot; is offer help first and then your
recommendation or critic (by the way in the KDE project this is a &quot;written
rule&quot;). Probably in the Windows world you (and I) are experts but in Linux we
are beginners so be hunger as beginner. To me collaborate on open
source projects are part of my
contribution to make a better world. I'm pretty sure all of us have lot of
good thing to offer to the MD community. Share the solution!!!

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mails like this are really irritating. I've been working on MonoDevelop
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for more than two years now, doing my best to make MD useful, stable and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; easy to use, and I spent many hours of my free time on it. You say
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that's not enough? sorry, I'll try to do it better in my next life.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I installed .12 from synaptic in ubuntu because my .13 install
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; would not start mono.  I get the MOZILLA_HOME_FIVE issue.  When I went
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to start the .12 monodevelop it would not start.  For some odd reason I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; can start it from a root console.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you installed a package from a distro and it doesn't work at all, go

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Where is the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 1 - step by step installation list
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 2 - log of problems you can encounter and how to fix them when you do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; after the install of a mono distribution?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Waiting for somebody to write it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Am I just missing information?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You are missing that this is an open source project. The core
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; development team is very small and can't do everything. I'm tired of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; asking the community to contribute tutorials and guides. Nobody has yet
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; written one that can help you. Sorry about that, but please don't blame
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the development team.
