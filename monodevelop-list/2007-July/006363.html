&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi everyone,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've been trying to install mono 1.2.4 and monodevelop 0.14 since last
</I>&gt;<i> week and it's a been a nightmare. I need the lastest version to import
</I>&gt;<i> a Visual Studio 2005 project in Linux (Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper Drake using
</I>&gt;<i> Gnome as my window manager). First, i download the installer from
</I>&gt;<i> mono-project, but the monodoc and monodevelop icons didn't seem to
</I>&gt;<i> launch any exe.  After looking for a while, i uninstalled everything
</I>&gt;<i> and decided to start from strach with the sources from the svn
</I>&gt;<i> repositories. I install mono 1.2.4 without any prob but then it got
</I>&gt;<i> complicated for monodevelop with all the depencies and etc. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For each depency, i use those commands:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>                   ./configure or bootstrap&lt;version&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> --prefix='pkg-config --variable=prefix mono' which is euivalent
</I>&gt;<i> to /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/../.. 
</I>&gt;<i>                    make 
</I>&gt;<i>                    make install
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After several hours, monodevelop seem to be install on my system. But
</I>&gt;<i> when i tried to launch the IDE i got the followings warnings and
</I>&gt;<i> exceptions.
