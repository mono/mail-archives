&gt;<i> I am no attacking any of you personally or blaming!  
</I>
I considered 'the team does not do enough' as a personal attack because
I'm part of this team.

&gt;<i> I am posing some 
</I>&gt;<i> fundamental questions here.  It never ceases to amaze me how programmers 
</I>&gt;<i> get all sensitive when it comes to really constructive criticism! 
</I>
I wouldn't got so sensitive if the criticism was really constructive.

&gt;<i>  Do 
</I>&gt;<i> you work on MonoDevelop for yourself or for others AND yourself?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What is the point in putting in all of the sweat time you have if it is 
</I>&gt;<i> a massive pain to use your software by everyone else!  In fact, after an 
</I>&gt;<i> install you can't even use it AT ALL!!!  This is 2007!  
</I>
It never ceases to amaze me how an experienced programmer can fall to
the trap of generalizing a personal setup problem. There are thousands
of people using MonoDevelop everyday in many different distros. The fact
that you have a setup problem doesn't mean that everybody has.

&gt;<i> hehe  As spock 
</I>&gt;<i> says.. the needs of the many far out weight the needs of the one.  Why 
</I>&gt;<i> develop something that always has problems loading after someone 
</I>&gt;<i> installs it?  Does it not make more sense to ensure the quality of 
</I>&gt;<i> deployment before a massive list of features?
</I>
OK, let's eliminate MD features until it becomes just a text editor with
fancy icons. I can ensure you that deployment will be flawless in all
available distros. Well, to tell the truth I can't even ensure it in
this case. Linux is so diverse, with so many distros, 2 major desktop
environments, with support for so many processor architectures..., it is
impossible to test all cases.

The only way we can improve the deployment experience is through an
iterative process, by doing frequent releases and letting users try and
report problems. Of course, users will only try software if they find it
useful, which means having a good feature set.

But after all, we are software developers, not distributors. It is the
responsibility of a distro to ensure that the packages they provide work
as expected.

Lluis.
