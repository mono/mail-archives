How about a MonoDevelop plugin for automatically generating documentation and 
UML representations from code? You could use the MonoDevelop sources as your 
test case and maybe do something like adding attributes to the code for 
inserting extra documentation. Surely this fulfils the need for a code based 
project that allows you to learn the internals of MonoDevelop whilst also 
helping EVERYONE out by creating some good documentation and letting them do 
the same for their own apps.

I'm thinking of something along the lines of the DOxygen system.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;View class hieriachy as UML&quot; plugin could be nice. I will propose this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one also.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop's existing refactoring capabilities should be up to the
