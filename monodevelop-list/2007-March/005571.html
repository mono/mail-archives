<PRE>Hi, I'm new here

Within Monodevelop I created the wrong type of project and couldn't
find how to delete it, so deleted the folder directly from the command
line.
Back in Monodevelop I tried to create a new project with the same
name, but got the error message:
&quot;A Project with that name is already in your Project Space&quot;

I looked it up in the source and saw the keyword &quot;runtime&quot;. So I tried
closing and re-opening Monodevelop and was then allowed to create the
project with the same name.

Where exactly is the &quot;Project Space&quot; please?
And is there a better way to delete projects so as to recreate under
the same name?

Fay
</PRE>
