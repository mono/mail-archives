<PRE>I do it all the time, for projects, classes, etc. But it is a bit
clumsy nowadays.

Right-Click the item in the Project tree, choose &quot;Delete&quot;, this just
removes it from the solution or project. Then you right-click the
parent node of the 'not-quite-deleted' object in the tree, and choose
&quot;Display Options&quot;, and turn on the &quot;Show All Files&quot; checked menu item,
the &quot;deleted&quot; object will reappear, right-click it again and now
choose &quot;Delete&quot;, note that the confirmation dialog asks something
different as it now going to really delete the file/folder. Change
&quot;Display Options/Show All Files&quot; back off to unclutter the tree.

Well I would really prefer something like having two menu actions a
&quot;Remove from project/solution&quot; and a real &quot;Delete&quot;, This would also
help with version control, as the first action would probably also put
the item in the &quot;svn:ignore&quot; list, and the second would plain &quot;svn
remove&quot; it.

Fun,
