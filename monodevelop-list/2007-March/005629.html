<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; * When &quot;Enable type-ahead find&quot; option is set, the Find command brings
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; up a simple toolbar below the editor instead of a separate dialog box.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Instead of having two options, I suggest that C-f always activates this
</I>&gt;<i> mode, and that a different combination is used to activate an &quot;advanced&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> mode.
</I>
I think that's a valid way of looking at it, too.  It would also get
around my &quot;no keybind to go to the advanced find&quot; problem at the
moment.  Plus, Lluis suggested it was bad as an option on the editor,
since it can be used on other things, so this would solve that problem
as well. :)

&gt;<i> &gt; * Typing in the find box will search the current file as you type.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Pressing up/down will go to the previous/next match in the file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One thing that might be useful, but I do not know how to do this would
</I>&gt;<i> be to also search on other files.   Not sure how to do this, because
</I>&gt;<i> people expect the C-g/F3 to wrap the search around, not change the
</I>&gt;<i> buffer.
</I>
Yeah, that was something I could not come up with a clean way to do,
though I'm certainly open to suggestions.   Perhaps some combination
of actions would cause it to move to the next open buffer to search or
something like that?  I'm not sure how you'd ever cleanly have it
search any file in the solution, but maybe I'm just thinking about it
wrong.

&gt;<i> &gt; * Currently, any options not exposed on the toolbar itself will use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the options set in the advanced box.  For example, if in the advanced
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; box the search is set to use Wildcards or Regexp, the toolbar will use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that option.  This seemed like a simple way to allow users to modify
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the &quot;default&quot; behavior of that find box, but there might be a better
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This might feel strange, what about adding a checkbox in that bar to
</I>&gt;<i> configure those options?
</I>
Originally I was going to try to come up with a way to put all of
those options on the bar, but the issue is...well, there are a lot of
options and not a lot of bar, so I was trying to keep the visible
stuff to a minimum.  Especially since I'm also trying to display the
'Reached bottom, continued from top.' or 'No results found.' message
in that bar as well.

I'm going to look at it tonight and make some of Lluis's suggestions,
so I'll see if I can come up with anything more intelligent to do with
those as well.
