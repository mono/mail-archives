<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I would like to use Monodevelop to write Win32-API Windows apps.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is it possible to do this?
</I>
Sure is - write your code, compile and run it on anything using the .NET
framework, unless you mean using raw Win32 native calls then I've no
idea. .NET yes, MFC, possibly but I'd not like to guarantee it.

&gt;<i> Must I use winelib with Monodevelop or is there a Monodevelop-native way
</I>&gt;<i> of doing it?
</I>
If you're after a winform designer, it's the only thing (IMHO) that
hasn't been implemented yet. Me, I use virtualbox running Win2K and have
VC#2005 on there, create the form, bring it back to Linux and develop
under MD. Much nicer.

Winelib is not needed. Winforms are mostly there now and this runs in a
managed mode, so nothing else is needed.

&gt;<i> What packages do I need?
</I>
Dunno. What version of Linux are you using. Under fedora yum -y install
monodevelop* gtk-sharp* should drag in what you need.

TTFN
