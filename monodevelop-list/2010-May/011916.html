<PRE>
I've done some searching on the forum prior to posting, so my apologies if
this is actually answered someplace and I missed it.  I've also been going
thru the FAQ on mono as well, but its not clear to me.

I was told that if I have a program that is written in VB2008 (thus a .NET
app) that I can use mono to build and run on a Mac running OS-10.5, such
that it runs as if it was a native application.  However in reading thru
some of the forum Q&amp;A, it appears that may not be the case.

The end result is...I want to be able to port my application currently
running on Windows to Mac, and have it behave as native, meaning not having
to load up other apps to make it run...Xwin, etc.  Simply just &quot;run&quot; the
program.  Yes I know there may be some tweaking involved.  

So, pretty much what I am looking for is a yes or no answer....will mono
allow me to do this?
