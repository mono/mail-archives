&gt;<i> Hello list,

</I>&gt;<i> I started using MD on Mac, while being a regular VS user on PC (I hope

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to adjust a few things to become really comfortable but I
</I>&gt;<i> fail to find where/how.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. I'm used to press Ctrl+Backspace to cleanup useless whitespace
</I>&gt;<i> before cursor - but in MD it will remove the whitespace AND the first
</I>&gt;<i> word found, regardless of punctuation. ie. it doesn't stop at the
</I>&gt;<i> first curly brace or semicolon. This is not right imho, and it's
</I>&gt;<i> driving me nuts :)
</I>
Try switching the &quot;word breaking mode&quot; to &quot;SharpDevelop&quot; - this is a
more windows-like word boundary algorithm.

&gt;<i> 2. Where can I edit reformater rules?
</I>
Depends. The &quot;Default Policies&quot; dialog can be used to edit the
settings that will be used for new projects, but once projects are
created, the settings are stored in the solution to ensure consistency
between different users. You can edit them in the solution options (or
even override at the project level).

Yes, I know it's a bit unintuitive - we need to add controls for
applying the defaults to the current solution. Not sure how else we
could make it more usable - if you have suggestions, please file a bug
report.

&gt;<i> 3. I'd like to insert the completion list token on Enter keypress too
</I>&gt;<i> - is it possible?
</I>
Ensure your list is in &quot;completion mode&quot;. Like VS2010, the list has
two modes - &quot;suggest&quot; and &quot;complete&quot;. You can distinguish between them
by whether the item in the list is selected, or merely outlined. When
an item is outlined (&quot;suggestion&quot;) only tab will commit it. When it's
selected, enter, punctuation and space will all commit it.

By default the list is in completion mode. The purpose of completion
mode is that you should (almost) never have to explicitly complete,
you just hit your next space or punctuation or whatever and carry on.
However, sometimes the list might not contain what you want to type,
in which case it becomes annoying. In these cases, you can use
suggestion mode, and sometimes the completion engine may pop up the
list in suggestion mode automatically because it knows it cannot
provide a &quot;complete&quot; list.

If you prefer suggestion mode by default, or you want to use
suggestion mode temporarily (for example, using symbols before
actually defining them) you can toggle it explicitly using
opt-shift-space or the edit menu.

Anyway, short answer, you probably toggled suggestion mode on
accidentally, please toggle it off :)

&gt;<i> 4. Are there plans to improve the UI to look better under Mac/Win? I
</I>&gt;<i> don't want to hurt anyone's feelings or be flamed but there is really
</I>&gt;<i> room for improvement.
</I>
Where we see opportunities to do so relatively easily, yes. For
example, I have recently implemented native file dialogs on Mac.
