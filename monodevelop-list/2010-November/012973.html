<PRE>A bit late to the party, but I'll throw my comments in :)

Having the comments seems pointless to me. What does it really gain us?
If people forget to document at the moment then I think that they're
likely to forget to document when the template is there. How many
default comment blocks would that leave?

I think that Bob Lang's suggestion was quite good:

&gt;<i> What I think would be useful would be for the template *not* to have
</I>the documentation template by default, but for the editor to have an
extra command which will decorate the current method/class/whatever on
demand with an appropriate comment skeleton.

If we could have a command to say &quot;Comment class and all public members&quot;
then the user would be intentionally adding the comments and so would
presumably be going through and filling in values. They could do it now
by just hitting &quot;///&quot; before all of the public members, but one command
instead of repeated key presses would be a time saver. It'd also save
you going through and going &quot;public? no, next. public? no, next...&quot; and
would let you skim for the more obvious comment blocks.

I'm not quite sure I understand the intention of Anirudh's comment.
Depending on what was meant then it could be good or it could be bad.
Documenting abstract methods to say &quot;this method does X&quot; so that people
know what to implement is good, but excessive boilerplate code and
comments would seem bad.
