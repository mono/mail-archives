<PRE>Hi,

My name is Andrzej Skalski, and I am a student of 4th year of Computer 
Science at Warsaw University, Poland.

I would like to participate in development of MonoDevelop, but I am not 
sure how to start. Is there anyone with a ticket, who would use some 
support and could show me how to start?

I have also two ideas for future additions:
- a plugin to ANTLR, similar to ANTLR IDE for Eclipse.
- a meta-language in comments, similar to javadoc, but describing not 
hints for code completion, but visualisation for debugger. It would be 
extremely useful, if it allowed to abstract debugger visualization from 
code definition, by - for example - visualizin a tree-like structure as 
a tree, while it's defined as a structure with references to child nodes.

Are these implementable and/or desired?

Regards,
Andrzej &quot;akuda&quot; Skalski
