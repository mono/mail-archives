It's entirely possible to build MD on Ubuntu with distro packages (I
have since 2005), and since all Ubuntu packages are available on
Kubuntu, this shouldn't be a problem.

&gt;<i>     * The biggest problem is that there are many, many prerequisite
</I>&gt;<i>       packages that aren't listed anywhere and are not caught by the
</I>&gt;<i>       dependency checks of configure/autogen in the Gtk#, Gtksourceview,
</I>&gt;<i>       Gecko, and MonoDevelop packages. Some of the missing packages will
</I>&gt;<i>       cause the compile to fail, and even worse... some won't. This
</I>&gt;<i>       turned my compilation into a six hour ordeal of figuring out what
</I>&gt;<i>       was actually missing.
</I>
I'd be very surprised if the checks are missing. It's more likely you
didn't have the development components installed in a place in which
pkg-config was set up to look. If anything really is missing, could
you list it so that we can add checks?

&gt;<i>     * If you download only the packages listed in the &quot;Installing from
</I>&gt;<i>       Source&quot; (<A HREF="http://www.monodevelop.com/Download">http://www.monodevelop.com/Download</A>) section, it won't
</I>&gt;<i>       ever work. It left me scratching my head when it exploded with
</I>&gt;<i>       errors due to missing gnomesharpglue-2. I never did figure that
</I>&gt;<i>       one out exactly.
</I>
The gnomesharpglue library is built with Gnome#, but depending on
which prefix you installed it into, and whether $prefix/lib was in
your LD_LIBRARY path and /etc/ld.so.conf settings, the system library
loader may not have been able to find it. This would cause
DllNotFoundExceptions.

&gt;<i>     * Related to the previous nitpick: The migration of some pieces from
</I>&gt;<i>       gtk# to gnome-sharp threw me for a loop. When my first SVN build
</I>&gt;<i>       didn't work, my web searches indicated that my missing
</I>&gt;<i>       gnome-vfs-sharp was part of gtk#. Thinking something was currently
</I>&gt;<i>       broken in SVN, I downloaded the 2.8.3 tarball... which some of the
</I>&gt;<i>       other SVN packages consider to old to meet their pre-reqs. So, I
</I>&gt;<i>       wasted a lot of time trying to make them work with the old version
</I>&gt;<i>       before that caused me to realize it was actually the build of
</I>&gt;<i>       gnome# at fault (which configured fine, but was silently failing
</I>&gt;<i>       to install vfs because of pre-reg gnome packages).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All in all... I'm sooo... glad that's over. Monodevelop looks great so
</I>&gt;<i> far. I've played with SharpDevelop on my Windows box and am anxious to
</I>&gt;<i> see how the two compare.
</I>
Good to hear you got it working!

FWIW, &quot;sudo apt-get build-dep monodevelop&quot; would have eased your pain a lot...
