</I>I wish I had an exact list, but by my 20th time through compiling
everything I just started installing gnome and -dev libraries
wholesale:  libvte-dev, gtkhtml, etc.  I'm not sure which of the ones I
installed got everything to build properly, but MonoDevelop wouldn't
work until I hit the magic packages..

I didn't know things weren't being built when I first tried SVN, because
bootstrap on the new GTK# didn't tell me.  It wasn't until I tried
building GTK# 2.8.3 that .configure showed me that four things wouldn't
be built because of missing pre-reqs.  That's how I realized I needed
librsvg2-dev et al.


&gt;<i> FWIW, &quot;sudo apt-get build-dep monodevelop&quot; would have eased your pain a lot...

</I>&gt;<i>

I considered doing that, but did not because I expect it would have
installed the Ubuntu Mono package, which would not work.  Monodevelop
failed checking for UNMANAGED_DEPENDENCIES_MONO, until I compiled Mono
from source.  There might be some path I could have added or something
to make it work, but I couldn't find any info on it when I did web
searches; I only found other people saying they had compiled Mono from
source to get around it.

Thanks,
