<PRE>Hi,

I'm new to MonoDevelop so excuse me if the question has been asked before.

Does the GUI Designer in MonoDevelop support Form Inheritance?  By
that I mean the following. For example, this is what I have done
numerous times in Borland Delphi's IDE and would like to know if it is
possible with MonoDevelop.  I use Form Inheritance in Delphi a lot!

Example:
I create a Basic Form, which knows how to save and restore it's
position. I then create a Basic Edit form which descends from Basic
Form and which implements functionality to edit a Object.  I then
create a 3rd form for example called Person Edit Form, that descends
from Basic Edit form and that implements the Person specific fields to
edit.

Each of these 3 forms can be design with the GUI Designer. In the
basic Edit Form I introduced 2 buttons (Save &amp; Cancel) and in the
third Person Edit Form I can see those two buttons. I can change them,
but not delete them.

It's like normal class inheritance, but visually with Forms.  Can
MonoDevelop's GUI Designer handle something like this?

Regards,
  - Graeme -
