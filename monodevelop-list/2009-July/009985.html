</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Using standard data types (string, bool, int, etc) for design time
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; properties in custom controls in Monodevelop is easy, but I'm not sure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how to use non-standard data types. For instance if I had an enum that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; looked like this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     enum ImageSize
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     {
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         XLarge,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         Large,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         Medium,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         Small,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         XSmall,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         None
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     }
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would be interested in that to, but as I look into sources, stetic
</I>&gt;<i> never touches lib directly. Always over cecil, which is the biggest
</I>&gt;<i> design flaw any form editor could have.
</I>
You are wrong, it is not a design flaw. Stetic can touch libs directly,
although we are not doing it in MD for custom widgets.

&gt;<i> In this case none of property editors which aren't hardcoded are not
</I>&gt;<i> possible. No custom widget (beside the sucky ones combined in stetic,
</I>&gt;<i> and yes they do suck) can look like it should look during design time.
</I>&gt;<i> Nothing you code can be activated during design time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For now, I'm simply avoiding any usage of stetic as much as possible,
</I>&gt;<i> simply because it sucks as much as form editor could suck and because of
</I>&gt;<i> the fact I can work/rely more on hardcoded form.
</I>
Matja&#382;, I feel offended by this comment, both as a developer and as a
user of Stetic. That's a very unpolite way of talking about a form
designer which is useful for many users. The fact that it is not useful
for you doesn't make it useless for everybody.

&gt;<i> Make a custom widget
</I>&gt;<i> derived from DrawingArea, drop it into form. And it practically
</I>&gt;<i> disappears with height 0. And so on. Custom widgets and stetic is a big
</I>&gt;<i> NO GO. Now imagine having form populated with invisible widgets? I
</I>&gt;<i> rather write it hard way.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Correct me if I'm wrong. You'll make me the happiest man alive if I am.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and we want the design time property to be set like this (or something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like this):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         private ImageSize _MyImageSize;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         // this is where we want the design time property to be set
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         public ImageSize MyImageSize
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         {
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;             set{_MyImageSize=value;}
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;             get{return _MyImageSize;}
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         }
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How would we go about doing this, I know the answer is an easy one but I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just can seem to find it even though I have searched quite a bit. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thinking that the same methods that would work for enums would work for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; classes but I'm not sure of that either.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Solving enums would be easy (just hardcode generic Property Editor for
</I>&gt;<i> it, solving everything else is hard). Solve that and you achieved the
</I>&gt;<i> same as putting bandage on torn off limb. Form designer without ability
</I>&gt;<i> to impose new form designers? Well, reason enough to stay away from it
</I>&gt;<i> for me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Stetic should NOT be part of monodevelop or at least its AppDomain. It
</I>&gt;<i> should connect with remoting to it and designed to work in its own
</I>&gt;<i> window or connected with GtkSocket/GtkPlug to monodevelop window inside
</I>&gt;<i> monodevelop widget.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It should always go down and restart on recompile with all project libs
</I>&gt;<i> loaded the hard way. Simply as that.
</I>
Oh yeah, simply as that. If you have review the Stetic code you'll see
that there is code using GtkSocket/GtkPlug, and code for running stetic
in a separate process, which is not completed/enabled. I leave you
wonder why, I don't feel like answering anything else from this mail.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I tried to do some work on that part long ago, but car crash and time I
</I>&gt;<i> lost because of it had forced me into different needs and I simply
</I>&gt;<i> haven't got time to focus back (which I still feel a bit guilty about,
</I>&gt;<i> because I haven't kept my promises). But if you plan on working to fix
</I>&gt;<i> that. I can help. Although if I'd be in your place, I'd probably rather
</I>&gt;<i> design my own form editor, which doesn't start with flaws than try to
</I>&gt;<i> fix something which is utterly broken.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Don't get me wrong. I LOVE monodevelop. Almost fanatically. I just hate
</I>&gt;<i> stetic which is the one part of monodevelop I'd be glad if I could get
</I>&gt;<i> rid of from my monodevelop like I can get rid of debugger.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> m.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Again I apologyze if this has already been asked.
