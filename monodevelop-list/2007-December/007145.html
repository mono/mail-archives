<PRE>Hi,

We have some basic developer documentation at
<A HREF="http://monodevelop.com/Developers,">http://monodevelop.com/Developers,</A> though it's a little out of date.
One of the most useful things you could do would be to write
documentation from the point of view of someone getting started with
MonoDevelop -- experienced users often assume that people know a lot
of things already.

Step one is to build MonoDevelop from our subversion repository. You
can try it out, see what's in the latest code, change things and test
them out, then generate patches and send them to the mailing list. i
won't go through explaining everything here as they're already
documented in many other places -- this is a development cycle that
applies to most open-source projects

If there's anything is particular you're interesting in contributing,
just post a message here and we can discuss implementation strategies.
Bear in mind that it's much easier for us to answer specific questions
than general ones.

Right now we're in the bugfixing cycle for our upcoming 1.0 release,
so the core team isn't working on new features right now, and our
roadmap for the next release is still not finalised
