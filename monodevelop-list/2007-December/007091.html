Ah, sorry about this. The translation infrastructure has changed along
with the new build system, and translations are split into multiple
parts. In addition to this, the new Gettext Translation addin is being
used to maintain the list of strings, so POTFILES.in isn't being kept
up-to-date. In the long-term, this is probably a job for the makefile
synchronisation. The biggest problem is Mono.Addins, which is now an
external dependency, but still doesn't haven translation
infrastructure (although it makes Gettext calls).

For the GHOP I've been having students use SVN revision r90630
(pre-build-split_, as this still had all the translations in one
place, and there have been no string changes since then AFAIK.
