<PRE>* &quot;Andr&#233;s G. Aragoneses [ knocte ]&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monodevelop-list">knocte at gmail.com</A>&gt; [2007-12-12 16:38]:
&gt;<i> &gt; Probably because README is targeted for the release, and there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ./configure will be shipped, not autogen.sh, which is for developers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And shouldn't the README also point to autogen.sh just in case it's read 
</I>&gt;<i> by SVN users?
</I>
Maybe it is assumed developers do know it? :D
I don't really know, probably it could be added there.
 
 
&gt;<i> &gt; So, you have to instruct Mono to look for GAC in /usr/local too.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You can do that by issuing:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; export MONO_GAC_PREFIX=/usr/local/
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Shouldn't the target &quot;install&quot; auto-detect (or just, not need to know) 
</I>&gt;<i> the GAC path, for example by the use of gacutil command?
</I>
No, it shouldn't.
/usr is generally meant to contains only files that are delivered by the
distro from packages.
If you are installing something from sources it should in most cases
go to /usr/local. That way, you can have both versions installed - from
package and from sources. What's more - you are decreasing probability
of conflicts, if you later install the same software from package. And
you can easily delete it from /usr/local.

If you really want to install it to /usr, you can pass prefix to
configure, but I wouldn't recommend it - it may backstab you later.
