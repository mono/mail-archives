<PRE>The code for the add in comes with a copy of smokey.exe so I don't think
there's a need to install smokey but I an try.

The addin basically has one command with a standard and update method,
which s derived from CommandHandler (I think). I also tried changing the
base class to NodeCommandHandler but that didn't work. is there anything
else that's needed to get an addin working could you tell me the
differences between addins between versions 0.17.0 and 1.0.0

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>        There's an addin for smokey that floating around on the web but
</I>&gt;<i> it's for version 0.17.0 of mono develop and doesn't work with 1.0.0 or
</I>I
&gt;<i> assume the latest 2.0a. I've had a bit of a play around with it. I put
</I>&gt;<i> the addin.xml file in the assembly as a resource, I think I amended
</I>the
&gt;<i> entries in the file (no default handler) and put some attributes on
</I>the
&gt;<i> handlers Run and Update methods. After all this is still doesn't work
</I>so
&gt;<i> there must be something I missing that's required to get addins
</I>working.
&gt;<i> Can anyone assist me in getting this addin working. I'm quite happy to
</I>&gt;<i> document the process so there's some documentation on writing addins
</I>for
&gt;<i> other people and I'm keen to write other addins or improve the smokey
</I>&gt;<i> one when I know how to write them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i>        Oliver Stieber
