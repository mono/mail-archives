If you're running a parallel install with trunk versions of MD's
dependencies, it seems likely that this error is due to an unstable
version of one of these dependencies (GTK#, Mono, GTK, etc). Updating
them may fix it.

If you don't depend on trunk features of these dependencies, it might
be a good idea to switch to the stable branches of them.
