<PRE>Today I fetched SVN release 128251 of MonoDevelop and then built it with the following:

    $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/mono --profile=all
    $ make clean
    $ make

All went fine and did not see any errors during the build process.  However after installing and then running /opt/mono/bin/monodevelop it displays the splash screen and the progress bar within gets about half way through and then it freezes and even waiting five minutes still does not start.  There are not any errors logged to the terminal and so I can't track it down without any messages.  I have built and successfully run MonoDevelop from SVN in the past and feel that all required libraries etc are in /opt/mono/...  - but that may not be the case - but need some help to determine if the problem is with my environment or with MonoDevelop.

Any help in this matter would be appreciated.

 
Brett Senior.
