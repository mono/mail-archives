<PRE>Hi!

&gt;<i> I've been a long-time user of Mono/MonoDevelop and just recently
</I>&gt;<i> discovered Boo. I noticed that the Boo support in MonoDevelop 1.9.1 no
</I>&gt;<i> longer has autocompletion support, and was wondering if there's
</I>&gt;<i> anything we can do to help.
</I>
Thanks a lot for your interest. The code completion engine and MD's
parser service api have undergone important changes in the past months
and the Boo add-in has not been updated to use the new api. Migrating
the code to use the new API shouldn't be too hard.

However, the big problem of the Boo add-in is that it loads project
assemblies into the MD process, and that should never be done. IIRC the
parser provided by Boo and the Boo console load assemblies, so that has
to be changed.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I noticed an earlier posting [1] to the list asking for help with the
</I>&gt;<i> project, and if time permits this term, I'd like to see if there's
</I>&gt;<i> anything I can do. My general question is, I guess, what work needs to
</I>&gt;<i> be done on the -boo plugin? I see that the parser needs some work for
</I>&gt;<i> code completion, and I also see that Boo uses GTKSourceView while the
</I>&gt;<i> other language support addins don't seem to?
</I>
Boo uses GtkSourceView in the Boo console, which other languages don't
have. It would be good to update the code to support GtkSourceView 2.0,
so it can be built with recent linux distros which don't provide GSV 1.0
anymore.

Thanks!
Lluis.
