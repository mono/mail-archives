<PRE>&gt;<i> Ok, the existing DOM is good for code completion but it's not rich
</I>&gt;<i> enough to do much analysis, I think I'll start by populating a small
</I>&gt;<i> subset DOM (which should be quite quick) I don't want anything that's
</I>&gt;<i> going to slow things down. I didn't think that CodeDom looked that great
</I>&gt;<i> but I did think that it gives you a complete DOM that can be built on
</I>&gt;<i> top of to have faster structures for things like code completion and
</I>&gt;<i> analysis.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I> 
&quot;You should try maybe the nrefactory dom, this goes deep enough down.&quot;


Ok, I'll take a look at that, I don't fancy writing a whole dom from scratch!

I'll may also MonoDevelop it a bit so that it uses things like DomLocation etc... with the thought of merging it into mono's dom. but that's not going to be for a while it would be nice to get something up and running first so I can see what the problems are going to be.

Ollie.
