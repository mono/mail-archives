I won't offer binaries right now, because it's not ready for end users
at all; there are still bugs that prevent it being useful for
anything, and hence it would present a poor impression. Developers are
welcome to build it and contribute fixes.

There were a few rationales behind the work I've been doing. The order

* Running MD on .NET means we can debug it in Visual Studio, which is
useful because the Mono debugger only works on Linux. This will make
it much easier to stabilise MD on Windows, which will be useful when
running MD on Mono on Windows.

* Running MD on .NET also helps to find GTK# bugs in Windows, and
Mono/.NET incompatibilities that MD depends on.

*  Getting MD to build without autotools means that people can work on
MonoDevelop without touching autotools. This applies to using MD on
Linux and the Mac, as well as VS on Windows.

*  Being able to run MD on .NET is useful for people who want to use
it as the basic of a crossplatform IDE without requiring their Windows
users to install Mono.

* Loading a large MD-created project in VS is a good test of MD's
project support.

Note that &quot;using Mono&quot; via MonoDevelop would require MonoDevelop to
run on Mono, which hasn't been the focus of my work so far. However,
this will become easier as a result of my work.
