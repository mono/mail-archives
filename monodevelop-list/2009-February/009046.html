That would be an interesting challenge :)

I imagine the way to do it would be to do live builds using gmcs (like
VS2008sp1 does with csc) to get live error and warning information,
and whenever these live builds are successful, then pass them through
Gendarme.

Another approach would be to implement some gendarme-like rules on top
of MD's existing live code DOM.

&gt;<i> If you can help me with understanding exactly what has to go into a
</I>&gt;<i> addin and maybe a little about how the interfaces between different
</I>&gt;<i> addins work I'm quite happy to write some documentation (or extend the

</I>&gt;<i> other people can write addins more easily, it would also make my job of
</I>&gt;<i> finding out what to do a little less painful and more productive.
</I>
Unfortunately we don't have much in the way of docs on writing addins.
This will improve after 2.0. However, we are happy to answer any
questions people have.

You can find a few docs here: <A HREF="http://monodevelop.com/Developers">http://monodevelop.com/Developers</A>

&gt;<i> If I can get something like ReSharper working in MonoDevelop then I can
</I>&gt;<i> switch a lot of my at work development over to it, so I can quite
</I>&gt;<i> actively maintain it whilst I'm still employed at my company (I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> planning on leaving anytime soon and I very much doubt they will ever
</I>&gt;<i> want to get rid of me) and put a few hours a week into development and
</I>&gt;<i> generally improving monodevelop.
</I>
What are the particular ReSharper features you'd like to see in MD?
