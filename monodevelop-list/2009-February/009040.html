The Smokey and Gendarme addins were merged and moved inte MonoDevelop
SVN: extras/CodeAnalysis

However, they are unfinished and have no maintainer. We are looking
for someone to take on the task, but no-one has stepped up yet.

Because the Smokey author has started contributing to Gendarme, IMO it
would be best to drop Smokey support, as it introduces large
abstractions into the addin.
