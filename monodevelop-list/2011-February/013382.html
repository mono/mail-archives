<PRE>I managed to get it installed after endless (and tedious) tinkering. I am not the most adept at the command line, but I didn't know where to find pkg.m4, so I googled the name and found a link from apple with a script on it, and just guessed that to be it (and it worked). Then I needed to find mono-addins, and I didn't know where to look as I assumed it came with the git download; unfortunately it was not included and instead it was in a separate repository managed by lluis? Once I found that I built it as an .app, and it worked fine. 

It did in fact have code completion for C/C++. 

Though I was in the end very upset by the installation process, I did learn a lot and was pleased with the result.
