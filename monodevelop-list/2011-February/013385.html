<PRE>I had a feeling I was doing something wrong, but I spent so much time on it I didn't want to just give up. I didn't install macports though because I found it stupid to have to download that just to get a different application to work.

My next step is OpenGL on MonoDevelop and figuring out how to get that going. All the libraries should already be installed.
