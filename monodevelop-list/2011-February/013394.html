MonoDevelop is a developer tool, so I think it's reasonable to assume
that people updating MonoDevelop should also be able to update Mono.
It's even possible we might require Mono 2.10 since it's a big
improvement over 2.8.

There are a few reasons for making the upgrade ahead of MD 2.6:
* It will make it easier to backport fixes from MD master to MD 2.6
* MonoDevelop on Mac uses MonoMac, so MD was blocking MonoMac from moving to 4.0
