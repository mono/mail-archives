<PRE>Hi,

I'm pleased to announce the release of Mono.Addins 0.6.

Mono.Addins is a generic framework for creating extensible applications,
and for creating libraries which extend applications.

The 0.6 release of Mono.Addins includes many improvements, bug fixes and
new features:

      * Add-in engine
              * Add-in name and description can now be localized. There
                are new custom attributes for defining them, and can
                also be specified as xml elements in an add-in manifest
                instead of attributes.
              * Support for custom add-in properties. It is now possible
                to specify arbitrary properties in add-ins, which can be
                queried at install time (using the Mono.Addins.Setup
                API) or at run-time.
              * Custom extension attributes now allow specifying an
                extension path. In this way it is now possible to use a
                single custom attribute to define extensions for
                different extension points.
              * The default add-in directory and the add-in database
                directory can now be customized. In previous releases,
                those directories were always created as a subdirectory
                of the main registry directory. In this release, the
                location can be set to any directory.
              * Improved error reporting when a dependency is missing.
              * Added support for specifying the type of the content of
                string node attributes. This information is used for
                documentation purposes only.
              * The Cecil based reflector now uses the new Cecil/Light,
                which is smaller and faster
      * Add-in management
              * Added support for enabling/disabling registered
                repositories.
              * Added support for downloable support files, to be used
                for package icons, screenshots, etc.
              * New and improved add-in manager for GTK#. The user
                interface has been completely redesigned to make it more
                usable. Add-in updates are more visible and easy to
                install. The add-in gallery is integrated in the main
                window, and can show custom add-in icons and preview
                images.
              * Added new API for accessing custom add-in properties,
                even before installing them.
              * Included information about download size.
      * Bug fixes:
              * Allow overwriting files when installing.
              * Fixed add-in unloading issues.
              * Fixed crash when running in .NET 4.0
              * AddinRepository.LastModified is always 01.01.1900
                00:00:00
              * Addin registry access/creation errors when accessed via
                UNC path
              * Addin discovery/loading fails when running Visual Studio
                unit tests
              * ImportAddinAssemblyAttribute can't be used multiple
                times
              * Fix bug in GetAvailableAddin.
              * Fix add-in database issue when the last add-in of a
                folder is deleted or upgraded
              * Don't allow inheriting CustomExtension attributes. The
                attribute must be explicitly applied to classes to be
                marked as extensions.
