</I>&gt;<i>

Can we wait until openSUSE catches up if you want to push to Mono 2.10, 
please? :D There is a nightly OBS with 2.11 in it, but that has even 
fewer packages listed than the Mono repo with 2.8 in!

I guess it is reasonable enough that developers are likely to be more up 
to date than most users, I just didn't know whether you were 
unnecessarily restricting users of mildly old distros (like openSUSE 
11.3) because of compatibility issues between MD and what is available 
and compatible with other apps that are installed.

Thanks.
