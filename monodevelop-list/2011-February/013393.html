I'm not myself, but F-Spot and Gnome-Do plugins from openSUSE were, so 
the upgrade uninstalled them. I've poked a bit more and found newer 
builds (which means more repos) that don't rely on mono-jscript, so I've 
upgraded to 2.8 and not lost anything important now.

The general thought/concern is still there, though: Is .Net 4/Mono 2.8 
really needed for MD, or is it premature? I'd have thought that wider 
compatibility would be good, so unnecessarily preventing a big chunk of 
developers having access to MD 2.6 just because they have a slightly 
out-dated Mono from their distro wouldn't seem good.
