The code completion database are generated when first needed, and can
take a while to generate. You should see indicators in the status bar
and completion window while this is happening.

The completion databases should never have to be removed manually,
unless they are somehow corrupted by a bug, so making it easy for
users to regenerate them would encourage ignoring the bugs instead of
getting them fixed.
