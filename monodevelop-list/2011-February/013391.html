<PRE>Again, in the interest of follow up, I have pretty good evidence that
the problem is related to the &quot;theme&quot; used. I had switched from the
&quot;Ambiance&quot; theme which I believe is the default in Ubuntu to one
called &quot;ClearLooks&quot;. The other day, in my effort to remedy the code
completion issue, I switched back. Then, at Michael's suggestion I
deleted pidb files. Over time, the code completion issue resolved
itself. That led me to believe that the initial theme-change was not
responsible so I subsequently switched back. Guess what, I am having
issues with code completion again.

I am not a UI person, so I cannot say what might cause the issue.
However, I do notice that the ClearLooks theme has a peculiar way to
select menus, it feels as though the mouse must be moving in the
direction indicating a desire to open a sub-menu in order to open that
sub-menu. So for example, just clicking Edit in the menu bar and
moving the mouse directly downward does not reliably open the
sub-menus (e.g Format), sometimes a flick to the right is required.
Perhaps the UI events that open the code completion box are also not
entirely what is expected? Any way, I am now searching for a new theme
under which code completion works, and has window borders more than a
single pixel wide (resizing windows in Ambiance requires more
dexterity than I have).
