&gt;<i> After being pointed to an interesting project written using MonoDevelop,
</I>&gt;<i> I thought that maybe it would be nice to include on our website a small
</I>&gt;<i> links section of apps and projects that were built using MonoDevelop.
</I>
I think this is a great idea. If there's interest, I'd be happy to put up
either some static content (as most pages are right now), or set up the
wiki as we had discussed on IRC before.

I'll be doing the wiki regardless, as the lead devs had mentioned they'd
like to have one up to build a user community and create dynamic FAQ and
tutorials pages. Does anyone have any other input in this area before I go
ahead with it?

Along the same vein, I know a couple of people who've asked for a &quot;built
with monodevelop&quot; button. Has anyone drawn something like this yet? If
not, I can take a stab at it with my stick-figure art skills. :)
