<PRE>The correct way to fix this is to add an event for when a file is added
to a project, and have the ClassBrowser force a full redraw on the file
being added. The classbrowser should be attaching and doing the same to
the file removed event as well.

Calling the OnCombineOpened event when a file is added to a project may
work now, with our plugin usage, but may not later. No need to create a
bug with a workaround instead of a proper solution.
