I'm not really ready to do it until I finish vte, java w/ikvm, and some
other things.  Then I have to look at how SharpDevelop's Assembly scout
works and if it supports my first requirements which is enable/disabling
addins trivially (which I suspect it will).  Then I will consider
updating, installing from the web and the other things and come up with
a proposal of how I want to do it.  

Of course, the process of how to go about it is right here and if
someone else does it first that would be great.
