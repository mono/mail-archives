Hello,
	MonoDevelop can support alternative editors, so although we may want to
stick with our current editor, you could write a plugin to use your
ScintillaNET wrapper also.  I would recommend you do a generic wrapper
first perhaps using the Gtk# parser and generator.  There is some brief
documentation in the Gtk# source of how to do so, and plenty of
examples.  It does require that Scintilla be based on GObject and
somewhat follow the GNOME coding style.  If not you might have to do it
by hand.  For more questions about that please ask on gtk-sharp-list.

Once you get that wrapper done you can start looking at adopting it as
an AddIn for monodevelop.  There is some brief documentation in
MonoDevelop/docs/WritingAddins.html which is also on
<A HREF="http://monodevelop.com">http://monodevelop.com</A>  We can also answer more questions on this list.
