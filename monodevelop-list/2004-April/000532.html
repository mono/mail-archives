<PRE>Hello Mailinglist,
I've just begun to program in C# using mono and I have a somewhat severe
problem with monodevelop-0.2. Everytime I fire it up it crashes after
typing something like 3-4 characters (I'm not kidding, it's really only
3-4).
monodevelop fails with this message in the console:

--- snip ---
(MonoDevelop:29817): Gtk-WARNING **: Invalid text buffer iterator:
either the iterator is uninitialized, or the characters/pixbufs/widgets
in the buffer have been modified since the iterator was created.
You must use marks, character numbers, or line numbers to preserve a
position across buffer modifications.
You can apply tags and insert marks without invalidating your iterators,
but any mutation that affects 'indexable' buffer contents (contents that
can be referred to by character offset)
will invalidate all outstanding iterators
/usr/bin/monodevelop: line 40: 29817 Speicherzugriffsfehler  mono
--debug ./MonoDevelop.exe $@
--- snap ---

As this does not seem to be a random error I'm thinking that something
might be wrong with my installation, but what?

I'm using gentoo and I've by now recompiled nearly all dependencies of
monodevelop to make sure theres no leftover...

I'm also getting some other errors like monodevelop sometimes doesn't
start up but hangs after displaying the splash (with no message in the
console). And is it correct behaviour that monodevelop always starts
with the same window size and position, not the one set last time?

I'll appreciate any help since monodevelop looks very promising but
isn't usable like this at all.

mfg
Martin
