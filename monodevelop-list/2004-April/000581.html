That I infact just did.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is something that would be really good ... a other good feature

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (which basically is equal to auto update the IDE).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But currently #D doesn't go in that direction ... maybe after 1.0.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> Yep, update is a good idea.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Well, with this we step into an interesting gray area.

Autoupdate would have to put the files somewhere. and since most
installs will be rpm, and installed into /usr/lib/monodevelop/ the
updater would need root permissions (You aren't running X as root, now
are you?). This would mean either 1) the updater is a seperate app (not
desirable imo) or 2) You run MD as root to update (also not desirable).

There are potential ways to workaround this, like allowing
~/.config/MonoDevelop/AddIns/ to be added to the AddIn tree so that
newer versions there would supercede installed versions, but then you
get into yet another updating concern, what happens when you have 0.3
installed, put some 0.4 pieces into your ~/.config/ addin tree, then do
a system upgrade to 0.5... the old pieces in the ~/.config/ tree would
supercede and screw you.

basically any proposal to add in-app updating would have to provide a
good way to handle that. It would also have to explain why this
functionality is desired(/required). I can see its use in something like
eclipse, which has a lot of third-party plugins, but right now, we don't
have that issue.
