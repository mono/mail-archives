I think it is reasonable to include most addins that you have.  I'm just
talking about the long run if someone writes a addin for a weird
language, a proprietary addin, or with odd unmanaged dependencies I
don't want to include it with the source or packages. I like the
integrate all possible addins approach.  I just want to disable ones I
don't want and give 3rd party's the ability to distribute their own.
Sounds like you have most of this in your AddinScout which I should take
a look at.

I think Todd added a 'context' to display certain menus conditionally
(like when debugging) and when Gtk# moves to GTK 2.4 the action api will
make things like this relatively trivial, at least for menus and
toolbars.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I think the solution will be to offer a mechanism similar to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;following.  Enable/Disable existing addins without requiring removal of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the dll/addin files.  Functionality to download a zip of an independent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;addin and have it automatically installed to the right place (it may
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;require a xml file that self-describes the functionality and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;dependencies of the addin).  Installing an addin manually or via a rpm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;should also still work.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> This is something that would be really good ... a other good feature 
</I>&gt;<i> would be 'auto-update' of addins.
</I>&gt;<i> (which basically is equal to auto update the IDE).
</I>&gt;<i> But currently #D doesn't go in that direction ... maybe after 1.0.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Yep, update is a good idea.
