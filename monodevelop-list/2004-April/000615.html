<PRE>Well, once I've gotten a good first pass at the GTK# stuff, I'll =
refactor the Windows version at the same time.
That Doesn't hurt my feelings :) , but I may need to silently &quot;upgrade&quot; =
my clients...

But, that way, ScintillaNET can support both MD and #D. Hmmm. (maybe I =
should refactor the name too?)=20



Ben Maurer had mentiond:

&gt;<i> * Scintilla does not do rendering as nicely as GtkSourceView; no
</I>&gt;<i>        pango use, it looks horrible.
</I>
Scintilla has supported Pango for a heck of a long time, it shouldn't =
appear crappy at all.

I'll have to make sure the port will support that correctly.


IRT the &quot;chucking&quot; away of code, I'm sure that we can make it a =
switchable/pluggable interface :)

	I personally like the idea of having the same editor control used on
SharpDevelop and MonoDevelop. It would greatly improve SharpDevelop's
performance, while adding code folding and other features to =
MonoDevelop. I
know a lot of work has gone into integrating GtkSourceView, and it may =
be
difficult to justify chucking away all that code.

Subject: [MonoDevelop] ScintillaNET on GTK# for MonoDevelop

Howdy,=20
I'm the devloper who maintains the ScintillaNET wrapper for the =
Scintilla
control, (which currently is bound tightly around the Win32 version of =
the
control).
I'm about to* embark on a crusade to completely OpenSourceify my life, =
and
purge myself of Win32,  and in doing so I found MonoDevelop.  I =
downloaded
the archives for this list, and in reading discovered that some folks =
had
mentioned using Scintilla as the Editor.

I'm more than willing to get ScintillaNET cross-platform and working as =
a
mono-enabled control, for those that wish to use it, and hopefully it =
could
be integrated into MonoDevelop soon.

Unfortunatly, the current version, is like I said Win32.
Through-and-through. I wrote it using Managed C++, which, unless I'm on
crack, there is no mono equivalent.

So, I'm looking to wrap the Scintilla GTK control in the same way that =
other
native code has been wrappered, but I've got a couple of questions.

Is there a tool for autogenerating bindings of native libraries, or is =
this
a manual process, and Where might this tool be.

and=20

Is there an interest for this?

* I have an on-again/off-again relationship with Linux and opensource,
Mainly it's my commercial customers that keep me in the Win32 world, but
with a viable .NET platform on Linux, I'm wanting to finish the job.
Currently my Laptop is Emerging about a trillion Packages, so I havn't
actually loaded the mono stuff yet :( , but should be there tomorrow.=20
