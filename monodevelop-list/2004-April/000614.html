<PRE>Howdy,=20
I'm the devloper who maintains the ScintillaNET wrapper for the =
Scintilla control, (which currently is bound tightly around the Win32 =
version of the control).
I'm about to* embark on a crusade to completely OpenSourceify my life, =
and purge myself of Win32,  and in doing so I found MonoDevelop.  I =
downloaded the archives for this list, and in reading discovered that =
some folks had mentioned using Scintilla as the Editor.

I'm more than willing to get ScintillaNET cross-platform and working as =
a mono-enabled control, for those that wish to use it, and hopefully it =
could be integrated into MonoDevelop soon.

Unfortunatly, the current version, is like I said Win32. =
Through-and-through. I wrote it using Managed C++, which, unless I'm on =
crack, there is no mono equivalent.

So, I'm looking to wrap the Scintilla GTK control in the same way that =
other native code has been wrappered, but I've got a couple of =
questions.

Is there a tool for autogenerating bindings of native libraries, or is =
this a manual process, and Where might this tool be.

and=20

Is there an interest for this?

* I have an on-again/off-again relationship with Linux and opensource, =
Mainly it's my commercial customers that keep me in the Win32 world, but =
with a viable .NET platform on Linux, I'm wanting to finish the job. =
Currently my Laptop is Emerging about a trillion Packages, so I havn't =
actually loaded the mono stuff yet :( , but should be there tomorrow.=20
