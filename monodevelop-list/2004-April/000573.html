</I>&gt;&gt;<i> undesirable for people with simple needs.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This might be ... but for SharpDevelop we have so few developers that it 
</I>&gt;<i> currently doesn't make sense.
</I>&gt;<i> We can integrate all addins and 'hide' them in the right place. From 
</I>&gt;<i> time to time we need to change the
</I>&gt;<i> menu structure a bit (like the view menu lately). But for now all is 
</I>&gt;<i> consistent and looks 'thin' ... what is
</I>&gt;<i> needed for #D is the ability to have different 'views' (gui layouts) for 
</I>&gt;<i> different 'modes' (for example
</I>&gt;<i> debugging).
</I>&gt;<i> But for some add-ins that might pop up it is surely better to download 
</I>&gt;<i> and install them additional. But
</I>&gt;<i> the main goal for #D was to integrate ALL avaiable tools. (Thats why 
</I>&gt;<i> these things are called Integrated
</I>&gt;<i> Development Environment and not VI).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think the solution will be to offer a mechanism similar to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> following.  Enable/Disable existing addins without requiring removal of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the dll/addin files.  Functionality to download a zip of an independent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> addin and have it automatically installed to the right place (it may
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> require a xml file that self-describes the functionality and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dependencies of the addin).  Installing an addin manually or via a rpm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should also still work.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is something that would be really good ... a other good feature 
</I>&gt;<i> would be 'auto-update' of addins.
</I>&gt;<i> (which basically is equal to auto update the IDE).
</I>&gt;<i> But currently #D doesn't go in that direction ... maybe after 1.0.

</I>I know this a little off topic, but speaking of SharpDevelop, I'm 
working here with a friends, I'm using MonoDevelop and he's using #Develop.
I can open his combines, but once I've done that, he can't open them 
anymore.
I think this is somehow related to file paths.
Is this a known problem ?
