I was looking into this last night also.  It seems to me there should be
an event for Adding/Removing Files (there is one for removing), but I
can't help wondering why SD doesn't have this (or why we didn't inherit
it from them).  It makes me think there is somewhere else where this is
supposed to tied in at.  Also, it doesn't work for when files are
removed, but a step in the right direction at least.  Any thoughts?
