<PRE>Hello,

I have never noticed this in #d myself, but #d has alot of features I
never see.

IMHO, the effort to port this over would probably become moot pretty
soon. Generics are much, much better than strongly typed collections.
Once Generics becomes a supported part of the Mono stack, such a feature
would have a risk of being axed.

However, given the open source nature of the project, if this is
important to you right now, you should go ahead and port it. As long as
the patch is well done, I am sure Todd would be happy to accept it in
the tree.
