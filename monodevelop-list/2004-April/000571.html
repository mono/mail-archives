&gt;<i> Hello everyone,

</I>&gt;<i> 	Since we are now at the point where there are a few different addins
</I>&gt;<i> and the possibility of more on the way, I began thinking about how to
</I>&gt;<i> manage them.  Currently you simply place an addin file and its assembly
</I>&gt;<i> in the right spot (depending on where your are running Monodevelop from)
</I>&gt;<i> and then addin is loaded.  This is nice and works ok.  We even have the
</I>&gt;<i> ability to have addins compiled and installed conditionally, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem that I see arising is enabling/disabling various addins with
</I>&gt;<i> various dependencies (which may not even be written in C#) and
</I>&gt;<i> installing them easily.  Most plugin-enabled apps I have used have a UI
</I>&gt;<i> for managing these things, which could include the possibility of adding
</I>&gt;<i> an addin automatically via a url.  Also, I think shipping most of the
</I>&gt;<i> possible addins with monodevelop may become a burden and even be
</I>&gt;<i> undesirable for people with simple needs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the solution will be to offer a mechanism similar to the
</I>&gt;<i> following.  Enable/Disable existing addins without requiring removal of
</I>&gt;<i> the dll/addin files.  Functionality to download a zip of an independent
</I>&gt;<i> addin and have it automatically installed to the right place (it may
</I>&gt;<i> require a xml file that self-describes the functionality and
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies of the addin).  Installing an addin manually or via a rpm
</I>&gt;<i> should also still work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These are just my initial thoughts and I am only talking about the
</I>&gt;<i> functionality not the UI yet, so comments and suggestion are welcome
</I>&gt;<i> especially from the SharpDevelop guys [1] in case they want to have
</I>&gt;<i> something similar (or maybe they already do?).  There are a few things I
</I>&gt;<i> need to finish before I can even get to this, so it may be a while once
</I>&gt;<i> we decide what to do.

</I>&gt;<i> [1] I'm not CC'ing Mike because I assume he is on this list, someone let
</I>&gt;<i> me know if thats not true.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Grrr, I forgot the part about having a small addin repository on the web
of said zip files and that the enable/disable status of an addin
probably only requires adding an enabled attribute to the addin file,
like so:
&lt;addin enabled=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;/addin&gt;
