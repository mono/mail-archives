Really, the problem is lack of autodetection.  It's easy enough to
recognise UTF-8, because the byte sequences that form valid UTF-8
sequences are very distinctive: While it's technically possible for,
say a (highly contrived) ISO-8859-1 encoded file to consist only of
byte sequences that are valid UTF-8 sequences, that just doesn't
happen in practise.

&gt;<i> UTF-16 requires the presence of a BOM (0xFFFE or OXFEFF, depending

</I>&gt;<i> if the BOM is present the compiler will know what codepage to use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> UTF-8 doesn't require it.  Which means it is impossible to

</I>&gt;<i> local codepage.  Consequently, mcs assumes that the local codepage
</I>&gt;<i> is used.
</I>
I would recommend scanning the file to check for UTF-8--ness first (in
the absence of any explicit declaration.)

&gt;<i> The solution is to either tell mcs the correct codepage, which is
</I>&gt;<i> what -codepage:UTF-8 does,
</I>
It's always a good idea to be explicit.

&gt;<i> or to insert a UTF-8 encoded BOM at the beginning of the file.
</I>
I strongly disrecommend that; the UTF-8 BOM will break a lot of other
stuff on a unix system.

Have a look at:

Now, I think it would be GOOD to buy FIVE or SIX STUDEBAKERS
 and CRUISE for ARTIFICIAL FLAVORING!!
