As Mike said update would be something for later, post 1.0 for them so
don't worry yet.  The right way to do it, if it's ever even done would
be to prompt for the root password if you didn't have permission to
write to the AddIn directory. Having ~/.config/AddIns is too much of a
mess in my opinion.

As for just installing or managing addins you also need permission to
write to the addin folder, so this may be required just for the simple
Addin scout.  It's really an implementation detail that can be looked at
later, no need to shoot it down before its been fully cooked or
proposed. This is the discussion before the proposal.
