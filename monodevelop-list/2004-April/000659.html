It's just the thing you call to say &quot;I've got this text and this cursor, what shall I suggest to the user&quot;. Ultimately, the data is actually pulled from the database by src/Main/Base/Services/ParserService/DefaultParserService.cs, which *also* handles parsing the file. That class implements an interface which provides *both* parsing and completion data lookup.

A few potential problems with the above:
- I don't really think you gain much by diverging from SharpDevelop here
- make sure you don't break anything that other languages would need
  (which changing ICompletionDataProvider may or may not do)
- I thought we were just going to have a downloadable db, and that way
the generation would become completely optional (and secondary) anyways?

I would personally like to have more of the details of what the overall
plan for code-completion generation is on the table.
