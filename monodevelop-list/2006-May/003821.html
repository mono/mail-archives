&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> First of all, thanks for comitting the add-in to SVN. However, I have 
</I>&gt;<i> some questions that I need to get answered to continue improving it:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. How can I get the Monodoc information shown as in C# and VB bindings?
</I>
If the documentation is properly registered in Monodoc, it should be
shown by code completion. This is unrelated to language bindings,
information is only shown for assemblies.

&gt;<i> 2. I've seen method information in Compeltion window is always shown in 
</I>&gt;<i> the C# order (in VB or Nemerle add-ins either). Are there any plans to 
</I>&gt;<i> change it so it takes the information from the add-in? If you tell me 
</I>&gt;<i> how this information is retrieved, I could try changing by myself.
</I>
Yes, there are plans for allowing per-language member formatting. This
will be done as part of one of the Google SoC projects.

&gt;<i> 3. Finally, the  use of Stetic in Nemerle. When I first add a window, 
</I>&gt;<i> the .n file is correctly generated. However, when I clic the window in 
</I>&gt;<i> the tree view to show the designer, it shows me a box asking for a file, 
</I>&gt;<i> and when I click OK, it creates a .cs file (in C#). However, I've 
</I>&gt;<i> checked that a generated.n file is correctly generated. Is this a 
</I>&gt;<i> problem of the Stetic add-in or a Nemerle add-in problem?
</I>
This might be a problem in the stetic add-in, I'll review it. In any
case, to fully support the Stetic designer you'll need to implement an
IRefactorer interface for Nemerle (you can also subclass BaseRefactorer,
which is a default implementation of IRefactorer).

Lluis.
