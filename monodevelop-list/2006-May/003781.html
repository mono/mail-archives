<PRE>KDevelop and Mono are both in core so I certainly agree that MD should
as well be in core!

If users' request can be effective just provide a contact and I'd
happily ask, as would others I'm sure, they review any decision to leave
MD out in the cold.  With FC6T1 freeze only two weeks away,  it would be
nice to know that FC6 will include MD in a coherent form.  While waiting
for the fedora-core-5 go-mono downloads I tried building from source,
using your rpms, standing on my head.... ;)

RH has tied mono so deeply that most attempts would have resulted in
removal of core mono applications.  Any time this machine doesn't work I
start to have the DT's.... it's got my finances and TV captures and
whatnot.  I don't use force or nodeps on this one.  I'm sure there are
tricks I don't know.  Still, you see what I had to do to get it working.
In the past I'd built mono and its dependencies and applications all
from sources.  Having Mono in FC5 I thought would obviate that need.
But the generic MD sources conflict greatly with RH's idea of packaging
AFAICT.

But *today* is a good day.  It's all working.  There's a place to check
for the latest and greatest of MD and it will install and I know how to
clean it up.  And it's good stuff.

Until something changes....  it's never that simple, you got that
right!  :)

</I>&gt;<i> FC6t1 isn't just around the corner either - it's a month or so off!

</I>&gt;<i> Currently, gtksourceview-sharp and monodoc are being reviewed, though I
