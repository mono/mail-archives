</I>I implied things wouldn't work and that you would have to figure them
out for yourself if you go this route.  I believe Kamil has already
looked into some of them maybe he can provide more insight.  But this is
not really a good solution, just a temporary hack.

&gt;<i> However, I think MD should switch to the 2.0 runtime, because MD 1.0 
</I>&gt;<i> will sure target Mono 1.2, that already has generics support and so on, 
</I>&gt;<i> so everybody could benefit.
</I>It is more complicated I think, and I really wouldn't mind doing so
myself, but we also have to consider:
 - apps developed will then depend on 2.0
 - are the 2.0 libraries stable and complete and supported
 - do the mono/mcs maintainers want to support 2.0 at this time
 - more small things that will delay a possible 1.0 MD release

In the past, people have expressed the desire for MD to slow down its
reliance on unstable or extremely new dependencies, so I think that is
where we stand until all the above and other things is answered to the
maintainers' (which is not me) satisfaction.
