<PRE>Ladies and gentlemen,

THE QUESTION:
I have recently installed a complete SuSE 10.0 on my box.  I am trying 
to upgrade Monodevelop to version 0.8.  I tried using YaST to do it, 
but had lost of trouble.  Also attempts to locate Red Carpet (which is 
supposed to be the best way to go) did not end with success.  Please 
help!

THE DETAILS:
I tried to use YaST to install the new versions of Mono and 
Monodevelop.  I went to the following page:
<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/download/suse-100-i586/">http://www.go-mono.com/download/suse-100-i586/</A>
downloaded and unzipped *all* packages into a single directory, added 
it to YaST's installation sources, and clicked on the 
'mono-complete-1.1.9.2' RPM from Konqueror.  This called up YaST, and 
installed all Mono-related files.  Now, similarly, I clicked on the 
'monodevelop-0.8' RPM.  This again ran YaST, which subsequently 
complained about the lack of a number of libraries (listed below).  All 
of the missing libraries are listed as 'mono(something)', e.g. 
'mono(glade-sharp)'.  Are these Mono bindings?  If so, where do I get 
them?

If Red Carpet is a much easier tool to use for package installation, 
where do I get it?  Allegedly it comes with SuSE (at least I found 
references to it being part of 9.3), but I cannot find it using YaST.  
Otherwise, I did find some old versions for SuSE 7.x and 8.x, but none 
for newer versions of the system.

I wouldn't want to use the Mono Installer, because it does not update 
the RPM database and I am afraid the whole package set will become out 
of sync.  But if this is the only way, please let me know.  :-)

Thanks for your help,

  Pat


THE LISTING:
Following is the list of conflicts generated by YaST when I attempted 
to install Monodevelop:
