<PRE>Hi all,

So I saw somewhere on the wiki that there's a need for a Monodevelop 
logo. I'm going to take a crack at said logo, worst case scenario is I 
don't succeed and we're back where we started. :)

I'll post urls of draft images to the list as I go for feedback, if you 
have ideas (stupid or silly, I'm totally not one to judge) please feel 
free to share them with me: idan at fastmail dot fm.

Right now here's what I've thought about so far (not an exhaustive list):

- No hammers or wrenches. There has to be a better metaphor for building 
software.

- If it's possible, maybe not something with the mono monkey? I like the 
mono monkey but we can't make all mono* projects be a monkey holding a 
wrench/pencil/paintbrush/M-16 or whatever. :)

Neither one of those thoughts are binding. I made some drafts with the 
concept of building-blocks (like the A-B-C wooden ones you had as a 
kid), since development today is often the work of constructing 
something larger out of smaller, modular pieces.

At any rate, this is just the beginning, like I said, please feel free 
to share thoughts and suggestions and I'll give it a go.

- Idan
</PRE>
