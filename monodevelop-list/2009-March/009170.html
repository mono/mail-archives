<PRE>
I have only been using Monodevelop for a few days and really enjoy the
software. The problem is i've run into a huge problem that can keep me from
using Mono. I hadn't noticed until I actually begin to write flags into my
code to know where I changed something, but Mono builds infrequently, and
sometimes not at all. I commonly use F8 and shift-F8 to build and re-build
my code, but Mono sometimes does not update the executable. This happened to
me 20 times in a row earlier while trying to debug a program. Then when I
couldnt figure out the fix I deleted my executable in hopes that Mono would
recreate the executable. 

Long story short I had to completely delete my workspace, and re-create it.
Copy and paste my code, then finally build a new version of my code just to
get the executable. Building the code didnt work until I had restarted my
laptop. I messed with Mono some more shortly after that and found that it
was building infrequently sometimes, and not at all mostly. At this point I
gave up and decided to ask if anyone is familiar with this bug, and if there
is a workaround. What is the most odd about this problem is that the first
day I was using Mono everything worked fine. But now on my third day using
it it's acting up. Any assistance at all would be greatly appreciated.
