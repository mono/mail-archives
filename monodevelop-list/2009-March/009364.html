</I>&gt;<i> &gt; True. The project has been inactive for years. I'm one of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; developers of MonoUML. We've been working on a framework for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; structured graphics that could be the base for this kind of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; applications. It's called MonoHotDraw
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (<A HREF="http://www.monouml.org/doku.php?id=monohotdraw">http://www.monouml.org/doku.php?id=monohotdraw</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yep, I'm aware of MonoHotDraw.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I don't believe anyone is working on anything in this area at the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; moment. I'd be happy to mentor a student who applies for this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm applying for the class designer this year.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, that's excellent news. Are you applying for other projects too?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; We are also very interested in a database designer, and I belive that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; it would be good to implement a &quot;designer canvas&quot; for visualising
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; objects with relationships, that could be used for both a database
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; deigner and a class designer. I'd suggest basing this on Moonlight as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the retained mode 2D canvas. This re-usable component would be a good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; mid-term goal, then the class designer could be built on top of it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Moonlight is really cool. But currently its GTK support is not working
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and work on the top of a project like moonlight is sometimes very
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; difficult. That's why I proposed MHD instead.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm. What are the issues blocking it? Will they still be blocking it
</I>&gt;<i> when SoC starts? I'd prefer to fix or work around them (and factor
</I>&gt;<i> that into the project evaluation), simply because using Moonlight will
</I>&gt;<i> be easier to develop and mantain going forwards. I'm sure you can get
</I>&gt;<i> up to speed faster using MHD, but maintainability is a big concern
</I>&gt;<i> with SoC projects. In the worst case, you could do much of the work
</I>&gt;<i> inside Silverlight -- which would open up the interesting possibility
</I>&gt;<i> of having the &quot;class explorer&quot; functionality usable on the web :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (I'm not opposed to using MHD, I'd just like to be sure it's the best option)
</I>
(I'm also one of the developers behind MonoUML)

I just want to let you know that if you are willing to implement a
UML-based canvas you may need to use nUML[1], in MonoUML we use nUML
intensively to define constraints and magic needed to support Models,
Diagrams, XMI support and so on. I've been updating nUML to UML 2.2
and .NET 3.5 so you can use recent changes any fancy linq syntax and all
the new features found in 3.5. nUML trunk uses the older 1.1 profile,
but using the newer profile will not affect anyhow,
branches/numl-research contains the recent updates, however a lot of
work (tests mostly) is missing.
