<PRE>Hi,

I've updated my proposal and added a lot of content and clarification, and
would really love some preliminary feedback before I submit it tommorow.

My project is titled &quot;TaskForce&quot;, and it tries to introduce the paradigm of
task centred development into monodevelop.

The proposal is quite huge, and can be retrieved from

Thank you.

&gt;<i> Hi, After speaking to mhutch on IRC the other day, I decided to try and see
</I>&gt;<i> if I can take several of the best features of the Mylyn Plugin for Eclipse,
</I>&gt;<i> which has been lauded to improve productivity among teams and deal with
</I>&gt;<i> information overload. I'd love to see this feature in MonoDevelop, and since
</I>&gt;<i> it's a deliverable independent extension, I think it'll make a nice GSoC
</I>&gt;<i> project. Please reply with any feedback, questions, or suggestions, I'll be
</I>&gt;<i> on #monodevelop with the handle &quot;antileet&quot; if you have any feedback.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Proposal draft content:
</I>&gt;<i> Title: Mylyn-like functionality for developer collaboration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Deliverable:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (A) A bug report management system with a single frontend and multiple,
</I>&gt;<i> pluggable backends to write to local database, bugzilla, trac, jira, etc
</I>&gt;<i> with the following functionality:
</I>&gt;<i>   (i)  Create, edit delete and query for bug reports with an interface
</I>&gt;<i> built in to the IDE.
</I>&gt;<i>   (ii) Edit bugs, change status, assignment, cc list, and many other
</I>&gt;<i> parameters exposed by the backend.
</I>&gt;<i>   (iii) Comment on bug reports from within the IDE, with ability to link to
</I>&gt;<i> lines of code and previous bugs, attach and download files, apply attached
</I>&gt;<i> patches and test them. The IDE will   also unobtrusively notify you of
</I>&gt;<i> unread comments to watched bug reports, preventing them from overflowing
</I>&gt;<i> your inbox.
</I>&gt;<i>   (iv) Ability to save queries for bugs and even categorize bug reports
</I>&gt;<i> locally. Suggested examples include bugs assigned to co-workers, and long
</I>&gt;<i> term goals for milestone releases, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (B) A system encouraging task driven development. A bug report is treated
</I>&gt;<i> as a &quot;task&quot; that has to be worked on. Tasks can be local - for personal use
</I>&gt;<i> and planning, or on a remote repository. In this case, a bug report is
</I>&gt;<i> equivalent to a task with only slightly different background. I hope to
</I>&gt;<i> expose the following functionality of the task driven development:
</I>&gt;<i>   (i) On marking a task as &quot;Active&quot;, and thus choosing to work on it, you
</I>&gt;<i> are not interested in any other details. The GUI will hide all other tasks,
</I>&gt;<i> and will not show notification of new bugs, comments, etc, and will let you
</I>&gt;<i> do your work.
</I>&gt;<i>   (ii) A small notice in the corner of the window reminds you on what you
</I>&gt;<i> are working on, and provides an easy and quick way to add comments to the
</I>&gt;<i> bug/task, thus alerting your co-workers about your progress(almost like a
</I>&gt;<i> twitter feed for your bug).
</I>&gt;<i>   (iii) [TIME PERMITTING]Cloning mylyn's famous &quot;Context&quot; Feature. Give a
</I>&gt;<i> particular task a context comprising of files, functions, classes, etc. Now
</I>&gt;<i> the solution view, and other views show only these files and even the
</I>&gt;<i> jump-to-type and jump-to-file show only these. This prevents overload on
</I>&gt;<i> larger projects, and enables tasks to be finished sooner. This feature would
</I>&gt;<i> obviously be optional and has to be willingly turned on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Benefits:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Functionality similar to what's found in Mature, Proprietary IDEs.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Possibly very useful for organizations and large software development
</I>&gt;<i> teams, and might help improve adoption of MonoDevelop in corporate
</I>&gt;<i> environments.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Useful even locally for individual users. Local tasks will probably use
</I>&gt;<i> ideas from David Allen's &quot;Getting things done&quot; technique.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Will be implementation independent and universally useful.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Makes communication between developers more seamless and intiutive, with
</I>&gt;<i> a bonus ability to link to code from bug reports and bug reports from code.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Prevents you from having to check your email/internet which can lead to
</I>&gt;<i> distractions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Inspiration:
</I>&gt;<i> Almost all ideas have been taken by the mature Mylyn project , which is
</I>&gt;<i> used as an Eclipse plugin. A lot of extra features and ideas are in concept
</I>&gt;<i> now, and not drafted officially.
