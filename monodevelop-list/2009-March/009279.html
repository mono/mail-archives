<PRE>I'm still working on a resharper like addin and I would like to know what are your top ten resharper features that you like. Well, maybe not all ten but the things you like the most and the things it doesn't do that maybe it should.

Here's my list, let me know if you like it. Have any additions extensions to it or any other ideas of things that you would like a resharper like addin to do.

Things I like in resharper aree.

Compiler Warnings and Errors.
Tidying up / Creating using declarations.
Extract Method.
Could be declared in inner scope.
Unused static
Could be declared static.
Some of the code generation for inline construction and classes and field setting.
Implement interface
Declare a variable at it's first assignment.

And maybe a few others I forgotten.

(things I hate are invert if statement, tried it once, was a bit of a fiddle to undo and made my code really unflexable when it came to wanting to do things in the future)


*****************************
Some things I would like to add that it doesn't do:
*****************************

Suggest using an interface or base class when possible to use it instead of the declared class (I think later version of resharper than I'm using do this but I haven't come across it doing it yet).

Show scope of a variable, and in the case of a variable being used before it's assigned show the scopes that it wasn't assigned in.

Move the variable to the inner scope it could have been declared in.

Wrap a class, i.e. have a class as a private member and wrap all it's methods for when you don't want to inherit it. (this may also be nice to do with with event's when a method is hit too)

*****************************
Some sudo-python features.
*****************************

Based on the usage of a variable:

declare it in the class, as a function parameter or as a variable in the function. And suggest it as a variable name in code completion if the type is correct.

Create a new Class / Interface / Struct for the variable with members based on the functions and fields / properties used on that variable.

Create a new function based on how it's called.


*****************************
	Coding standards checks probably as an additional addin.
*****************************
Some basic, but hopefully extensible coding standards.

Like using GetString, String.Format for strings and other (as defined by the user) best practices, don't declare members public use properties. I'll probably start with some of the IDesign list and see what can be automated.
Enforcing naming conventions as much as possible
Spell checking comments
Spell checking variables, function, class etc.. names (so long as Pascal, Camel or C&amp;R type naming conventions have been used)
