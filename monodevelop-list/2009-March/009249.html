&gt;<i> Hi,

</I>&gt;<i> an Asus Eeebox with 1Gb memory and using md beta downloaded and built
</I>&gt;<i> from svn a couple of weeks ago. The problems seem to occur when writing

</I>&gt;<i> cleared but then nothing is written. My latest problem was when the
</I>&gt;<i> gui-stetic file was wiped thus destroying all my widgets . I am
</I>&gt;<i> constantly backing up outside of md but even so I can loose a couple of
</I>&gt;<i> hours work. &#160;I keep looking at the forums and am aware that there are
</I>&gt;<i> absolutely no queries about md's instability so I &#160;believe that the
</I>&gt;<i> problem is with the Asus box in that it is too under powered. I bought
</I>&gt;<i> the asus as an experiment as I wanted a small computer to sit on my desk
</I>&gt;<i> and it seemed to fit the bill.

What filesystem are you using?

&gt;<i> So the point of this email is to ask if anyone else has had this problem
</I>&gt;<i> with md on a more powerful pc, or if anyone else is running md on an
</I>&gt;<i> Eeebox and can they let me know their experiences. I think that I need
</I>&gt;<i> to go and buy a faster more powerful pc, I just need reassurance that
</I>&gt;<i> this is the case. I am using md to develop my first application (4 sub
</I>&gt;<i> projects , approx 100 classes) under linux I have substantial c#
</I>&gt;<i> experience under windows, know nothing about how linux works under the
</I>&gt;<i> hood just enough to be able to compile from svn.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally as an aside does md have any log facility built in so I can find
</I>&gt;<i> out what crashed? If so where is the log file? And &#160;how often should I
</I>&gt;<i> think of downloading md from svn every week, month, never? &#160;I think that
</I>&gt;<i> md is an excellent piece of software and am resolved to sticking with it
</I>&gt;<i> no matter what.
</I>
The log's in ~/.config/MonoDevelop/log. Running from a terminal is useful too.

If you're using SVN, I'd suggest updating frequently, and testing it
with &quot;make run&quot; before you install. I'd also suggest switching to the
2.0 branch soon, since trunk may not be quite so stable when the
feature freeeze has ended.
