<PRE>Hi,

I'm new to monodevelop, and would like to help improve it as part of the
Google summer of code program. I want to try and add several simple and
smaller features to the IDE to make development more productive and
enjoyable. I'm taking a few ideas from the &quot;Top ten resharper features&quot;
thread, and want to implement as many deliverables and contribute to the
mono community in the long term, because I see the monodevelop platform as
something I will be writing a lot of code on in the near future, and want to
get a good grip on it and see if I can help.

Ideas:
1. Basic refactoring support like:
  (a) renaming all instances of a symbol over a namespace(something more
robust than find and replace), with previews and diffs like it's done in
eclipse
  (b) Extract codeblock into method, extract constants from strings, etc.
  (c) Anything else you can suggest

2. Preliminary warnings while the code is being written, possible type
mismatches, symbols out of scope, symbols not found, etc.

3. Basic interface for viewing and possibly commenting on bugzilla and trac
bug tracking systems using xml-rpc.

4. Marking warnings, errors as little marks next to the scroll bars, based
on their relative position in the document.

5. Anything else you suggest

I've got a good deal of programming experience in college, though I'm
completely self taught. I have good credentials including summer internships
in Google and Microsoft Research. Please give me feedback on these ideas or
suggest something else I could work on.

Thanks,
Anirudh
