<PRE>2009/3/28 Manuel Alejandro Cer&#243;n Estrada &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monodevelop-list">ceronman at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;&gt;<i> There is a standalong peroject called Mono.UML, though AFAIK it has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not been active in several years.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> True. The project has been inactive for years. I'm one of the
</I>&gt;<i> developers of MonoUML. We've been working on a framework for
</I>&gt;<i> structured graphics that could be the base for this kind of
</I>&gt;<i> applications. It's called MonoHotDraw
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.monouml.org/doku.php?id=monohotdraw">http://www.monouml.org/doku.php?id=monohotdraw</A>)
</I>
Yep, I'm aware of MonoHotDraw.

&gt;&gt;<i> I don't believe anyone is working on anything in this area at the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> moment. I'd be happy to mentor a student who applies for this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm applying for the class designer this year.
</I>
Oh, that's excellent news. Are you applying for other projects too?

&gt;&gt;<i> We are also very interested in a database designer, and I belive that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it would be good to implement a &quot;designer canvas&quot; for visualising
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> objects with relationships, that could be used for both a database
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deigner and a class designer. I'd suggest basing this on Moonlight as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the retained mode 2D canvas. This re-usable component would be a good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mid-term goal, then the class designer could be built on top of it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Moonlight is really cool. But currently its GTK support is not working
</I>&gt;<i> and work on the top of a project like moonlight is sometimes very
</I>&gt;<i> difficult. That's why I proposed MHD instead.
</I>
Hmm. What are the issues blocking it? Will they still be blocking it
when SoC starts? I'd prefer to fix or work around them (and factor
that into the project evaluation), simply because using Moonlight will
be easier to develop and mantain going forwards. I'm sure you can get
up to speed faster using MHD, but maintainability is a big concern
with SoC projects. In the worst case, you could do much of the work
inside Silverlight -- which would open up the interesting possibility
of having the &quot;class explorer&quot; functionality usable on the web :-)

(I'm not opposed to using MHD, I'd just like to be sure it's the best option)
