</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Preface:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm a complete newbie when it comes to gtk development.  Therefore the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> following observations and comments are coming from someone who has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> neither used monodevelop's gtk tools, or any other tools for gui
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> development.  Due to some frustrations with monodevelop's designer, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ended trying to use Glade3 to do the UI.  I shall try to point out some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of these frustrations.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think some of the frustrations come from an incorrect use of the GTK
</I>&gt;<i> framework. In GTK, widgets rarely are placed in absolute positions.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead, you combine containers to design the layout of the window, and
</I>&gt;<i> put widgets on the containers, playing with relative alignments and
</I>&gt;<i> margins. GTK also supports absolute positioning of widgets with the
</I>&gt;<i> Fixed container, but MD doesn't yet have design tools for helping
</I>&gt;<i> building guis using this container, because even if you can do it, it is
</I>&gt;<i> not the right way of doing it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
When designing something like this: <A HREF="http://openice.org/login.png">http://openice.org/login.png</A> , the
fixed container seemed the most intuitive.  You are right though, I
don't have any understanding (until now) on how the GTK framework works.

&gt;&gt;<i> I'm using monodevelop from svn.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) When adding a widget container, the default size is very small.  It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appears to default to about 1px in height.  It feels to me that it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should default to &quot;fill&quot; the entire canvas.  This applies to all of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> containers I used, VButtonBox, Fixed, HButtonBox.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This happens when you put a container inside a Fixed. We can fix that.
</I>&gt;<i> However, if you want the container to fill the entire canvas, just don't
</I>&gt;<i> put it inside a Fixed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
It also happens when you drop a Fixed container on an empty widget.

&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Glade's containers have grid markers.  These were useful to me when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> aligning buttons in specific areas.  In Designer, I had to guess.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Snapping functionality would be a nice addition to grid lines in Designer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We might add is, although I'm not very found of encouraging this way of
</I>&gt;<i> designing guis.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) I really liked how in Glade3, the V/HButtonBox(s) had placeholders
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for the number of buttons it was allowing.  Dropping a button in these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> placeholders was very intuitive to me.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4) The points around the widgets, eight in total, gave me the initial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> impression that I could resize the widget by clicking on the point and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dragging it.  I discovered later that those points are used for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> positioning?  The real way to resize the widget, in my case a button,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was to adjust the requested width and height.  This was the case in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Glade as well.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I feel that it would be intuitive to allow the adjustment of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;requested width/height&quot; by dragging the mouse on those points.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, when resizing widgets in a Fixed that would help.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
The app I'm creating is touchscreen targeted.  Becaue of that, I need
bigger than default buttons.  I think this would be useful in any
container for that reason.
