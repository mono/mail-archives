<PRE>First up, let me say that this feature is really cool. Thanks for
implementing it so quickly!

Is it possible for extensions to add template contexts?

&gt;<i> Automatically defined fields

</I>&gt;<i> Automatically defined fields are fields that are not defined by the user

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> $TypeName$ ()
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i> $end$
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And the $TypeName$ is inserted automatically. The auto fields are used
</I>&gt;<i> too for fully qualified type names. Fully qualified type names can be

</I>&gt;<i> 50% shorter !!!) template only expands to 'System.Console.WriteLine' if
</I>&gt;<i> there is no 'using System' in that file)
</I>
BTW, VS templates have a feature where templates can add references
and imports. I'm not sure which is the best approach -- automatic
import insertion or automatic namespace shortening.

&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;<i> Templates can be extended using the template editor available through
</I>&gt;<i> the settings dialog or adding them manually. Open the template editor
</I>&gt;<i> and closing it generates a template folder in the
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ~/.config/MonoDevelop/templates/code
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Directory. All user defined templates are stored here. The template
</I>&gt;<i> format is very straightforward. For example the mn template looks like:

Is it possible to add templates in an extension?
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What needs to be done ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The template system is very new therefore I except that there are bugs
</I>&gt;<i> here and there.
</I>
It seems pretty usable so far! I've only run into a couple of issues
-- the undo stack seems to get confused by templates, and it's not
possible to use &quot;enter&quot; to end the template when a completion dropdown
is present. Maybe including the end position in the tabbable regions
would help for this, and typing there would end the template.

&gt;<i> The functions that are available through the extension object need to be
</I>&gt;<i> extended. I think we should let drive this by the requests of the
</I>&gt;<i> template writers.
</I>
This would also be useful to be able to implement in extensions.

&gt;<i> More contexts for the templates. Currently there are only expressions
</I>&gt;<i> and 'normal' contexts.
</I>&gt;<i> Sub 'mime types': Currently the set of templates are the same for the
</I>&gt;<i> whole file based on the mime types. But some files have a different
</I>&gt;<i> 'language' depending on the position. For example inside 'doc' comments
</I>&gt;<i> could be a context for XML files. I think these sub contexts could be
</I>&gt;<i> very useful for embedded ASP.NET code.
</I>
Definitely! This is something we also need to consider in the context
of file parsing, code completion, syntax highlighting and style
policies, since none of these really work for &quot;mixed&quot; pages yet.
ASP.NET is only going to get harder --as well as inline C# or VB,
sometime we're going to need to support JS &amp; CSS too.

&gt;<i> The 'Surround With' list needs an input field to filter the templates.
</I>
That would be useful, yes.

Also in this area, SlickEdit has a really cool way to handle
surround-with templates when the user doesn't have a selection:
<A HREF="http://www.slickedit.com/content/view/353/217/#surroundwith">http://www.slickedit.com/content/view/353/217/#surroundwith</A>
Maybe we could have something a bit like this -- allow the user to tab
to the &quot;surround with region&quot; then use arrow keys to capture/uncapture
lines.

&gt;<i> Maybe the template/surround with pop ups need a category tree too.
</I>
That would be nice. Probably not an issues until people start writing
hundreds of templates though :)
