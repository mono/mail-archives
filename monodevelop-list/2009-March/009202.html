&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> I am having problems with md beta in that it keeps crashing very
</I>&gt;<i> regularly on my computer (several times today). &#160;I run opensuse 11.1 on
</I>&gt;<i> an Asus Eeebox with 1Gb memory and using md beta downloaded and built
</I>&gt;<i> from svn a couple of weeks ago. The problems seem to occur when writing
</I>&gt;<i> to the disc which seems to hang very frequently why I dont know. &#160;Often
</I>&gt;<i> when it does &#160;files are destroyed I think because in writing the file is
</I>&gt;<i> cleared but then nothing is written. My latest problem was when the
</I>&gt;<i> gui-stetic file was wiped thus destroying all my widgets . I am
</I>&gt;<i> constantly backing up outside of md but even so I can loose a couple of
</I>&gt;<i> hours work. &#160;I keep looking at the forums and am aware that there are
</I>&gt;<i> absolutely no queries about md's instability so I &#160;believe that the
</I>&gt;<i> problem is with the Asus box in that it is too under powered. I bought
</I>&gt;<i> the asus as an experiment as I wanted a small computer to sit on my desk
</I>&gt;<i> and it seemed to fit the bill.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the point of this email is to ask if anyone else has had this problem
</I>&gt;<i> with md on a more powerful pc, or if anyone else is running md on an
</I>&gt;<i> Eeebox and can they let me know their experiences. I think that I need
</I>&gt;<i> to go and buy a faster more powerful pc, I just need reassurance that
</I>&gt;<i> this is the case. I am using md to develop my first application (4 sub
</I>&gt;<i> projects , approx 100 classes) under linux I have substantial c#
</I>&gt;<i> experience under windows, know nothing about how linux works under the
</I>&gt;<i> hood just enough to be able to compile from svn.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally as an aside does md have any log facility built in so I can find
</I>&gt;<i> out what crashed? If so where is the log file? And &#160;how often should I
</I>&gt;<i> think of downloading md from svn every week, month, never? &#160;I think that
</I>&gt;<i> md is an excellent piece of software and am resolved to sticking with it
</I>&gt;<i> no matter what.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks
</I>i just used monodevelop beta from yestoday, it seems stable and
excellent, my box is debian sid amd64, 2G memory.
