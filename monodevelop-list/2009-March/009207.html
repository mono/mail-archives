&gt;<i> thank you, your analysis are right, and I'm really using gnome on
</I>&gt;<i> debian sid amd64.

No problem.  I *think* you may have to mess around with .desktop files
to get this to work - I can honestly say I haven't looked into it
fully yet, so I can't give you a concrete solution; but I may be able
to give you a starting point.

In /usr/share/applications there are a series of .desktop files.  If
you've got wine installed, you should take a look at the wine.desktop
file and see if you can reverse engineer it to work with mono.  Make a
copy of it, then you should probably change the exec line to:

  Exec=mono %f

And, of course, each of the lines that describe what the desktop file
is to reflect the fact that it's the Mono launcher now.  Take a look
at this guide for help on desktop files:

  <A HREF="http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/">http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/</A>

Hopefully this can get you started.  If you've not got the
wine.desktop file, here it is:

  <A HREF="http://source.winehq.org/source/tools/wine.desktop">http://source.winehq.org/source/tools/wine.desktop</A>

Hope this helps,
