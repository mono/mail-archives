Hi Adam,
Thanks for the response. Yep, I was realizing the same thing. I was creating
a new NodeView after the stetic code runs so the widget was still
referencing the old NodeView.

As for using the Model property, that looks like just what I need, but I'm
having trouble giving it a NodeStore object.  The API says that it expects a
TreeModel object, which apparently is an abstract interface ... and that I
could use ListStore, which looks like a good candidate, so that's what I'm
trying to use now, but I'm not clear on how. When I try to use ListStore I'm
passing a string array into .AppendValues(). and it compiles fine but then I
get a whole bunch of errors during runtime like so:

********
(nodeView1:17843): Gtk-WARNING **:
/build/buildd/gtk+2.0-2.14.4/gtk/gtkliststore.c:608: Unable to convert from
gchararray to GtkSharpValue


(nodeView1:17843): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_list_store_set_value: assertion
`column &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; column &lt; list_store-&gt;n_columns' failed

(nodeView1:17843): GLib-GObject-WARNING **: unable to set property `text' of
type `gchararray' from value of type `GtkSharpValue'

(nodeView1:17843): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_list_store_get_value: assertion
`column &lt; list_store-&gt;n_columns' failed
**********

what is a 'GtkSharpValue'? Is this what .AppendValues is expecting? It looks
like the API is saying it can take an array of strings or objects...
So it looks like the code I had for interacting with the NodeStore isn't
liking the ListStore but the API doesn't provide much details so I'm unclear
on how to use the class correctly.  An example for using ListStore with a
NodeView would be golden! Or if anyone can show how to pass a NodeStore to
the Model property that would be greatly appreciated also.
