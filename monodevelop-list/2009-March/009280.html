</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Is Gtk.Application.Invoke the thing to use here? One frustrating thing  
is that there doesn't seem to be a way to tell if you're in the GUI  
thread or not, so you don't know if Application.Invoke will block  
(running in the GUI thread) or not (some other thread).

Because, I want to do this:

   Application.Invoke(delegate {
     run-dialog-and-get-result();
     signal-caller(); // only signal if not originally in GUI thread?
   });
   wait-to-be-signaled(); // only wait if not in GUI thread?
   use-result();

But there doesn't seem to be any good idiom for that, given my shallow  
understanding of GTK.

&gt;<i> To make the dialog &quot;one shot&quot;, ensure that the dialog is modal
</I>&gt;<i> (MessageService.GetPassword already is), and put a lock around the  
</I>&gt;<i> code
</I>&gt;<i> that shows the dialog. This should be enough.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Not so much; when Dialog.Run is called, Gtk# still recursively runs  
other things in the event loop, and more VC operations may be run. A  
lock won't do it in this case, since it's the same thread that owns  
the lock.

I came up with this:

   runningDialog = false

   ShowDialog() {
     while (runningDialog)
       Gtk.Main.Iteration();
     if (lastPassword != null)
       return lastPassword;
     runningDialog = true;
     // dialog setup, Run.
     lastPassword = passwd from dialog
     runningDialog = false;
     return passwd;
   }

Which *seems* to work OK, except when loading certain projects the  
TreeView showing the solution gets corrupted. I don't know if this is  
a side effect of my implementation, or a bug elsewhere.

Thanks.
