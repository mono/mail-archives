&gt;<i> but it makes nothing change, double click on the exe file still
</I>&gt;<i> displays error message &quot;couldn't display....&quot;, is there anything wrong
</I>&gt;<i> with my desktop file? or anything more i need to do? thank you.

Hi,

Maybe check the permissions on the desktop file, make sure they match
what all the others are reading.  Apparently, Gnome monitors that
desktop folder, so you shouldn't have to change or refresh anything.

Presumably, also, if you've got Wine installed, that MIME type is
registered.  If you don't have Wine installed, then maybe you need to
add that MIME type to the database.  A quick Google turned up some
information about Gnome and MIME types, try Googling for something
like that, and you'll get some guides.

A quick grep of my hard-drive turned up /etc/gnome-vfs-mime-magic
which looks very interesting, and may be the way forward.  It seems to
contain signatures that map files to MIME types by reading the
signature.  You could try adding one for portable executables (Hint:
which always start with MZ ;)).  I'd very much recommend doing a bit
of research though, before tinkering with this terrible file.

Hope this helps,
