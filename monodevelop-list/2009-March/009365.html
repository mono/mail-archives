<PRE>The MonoDevelop team is proud to announce the release of MonoDevelop
2.0.

MonoDevelop is a GNOME IDE primarily designed for C# and other .NET
languages. MonoDevelop enables developers to quickly write desktop and
ASP.NET Web applications on Linux. MonoDevelop makes it
easy for developers to port .NET applications created with Visual Studio
to Linux and to maintain a single code base for all platforms.

The main features of MonoDevelop 2.0 are:

      * Improved ASP.NET and C# 3.0 support - The MonoDevelop code
        editor now offers an improved developer experience with improved
        code navigation, source outlining, and support for code
        completion in C# 3.0, ASP.NET, XML and HTML. Additionally, the
        MonoDevelop ASP.NET editor provides support for developing with
        master pages and custom web controls.
      * Built-in debugger - The MonoDevelop debugger supports both
        debugging Mono-based applications as well as native
        applications, empowering developers to quickly locate and
        resolve issues in their codebase from directly within the
        development environment.
      * Interoperability and capability improvements &#8211; MonoDevelop now
        uses MSBuild-style project files to increase interoperability
        with Visual Studio. Web projects are now also compatible with
        Visual Studio 2008 and Visual Web Developer 2008 SP1, providing
        more options for developers who want to build and deploy their
        web applications on both Windows and Linux.


Please see the MonoDevelop 2.0 announcement page [1] for a detailed
description of the features included in this release.

Many thanks to everybody that made possible this release.
Enjoy!

The MonoDevelop Team.
