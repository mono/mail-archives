<PRE>I know that the message that is quoted below is a little aged, but I am a
facing a similar situation. The work around that I have come up with is to
remove all .svn directories underneath bin in my project directory, but it
is a hassle to have to do this every I checkout new code.

I do think that I will remove my bin directory from version control, but I'd
like to have a better understand of why this is happening.

In our case, we are running MonoDevelop 2.4.2 with MonoTouch 4.0.2. We also
saw the same issue with MonoTouch 4.0.0. Our OS X is all up to date.
