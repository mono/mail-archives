<PRE>Thanks Todd,
I think the main problem is one of uncertainty - which
things to download/install - RedCarpet is sweet and
one feels a bit unsafe overloading a safe set of libs
- so after 2 hours of installing yet another unforseen
dependency tends to break ones spirit - a couple of
weeks ago I was trying to get gtksourceview installed
and somehow trashed X11R6 and had to do a complete
reinstall to get it fixed! Though thats more likely my
fault for doing a make clean as root in the wrong
place. I like to think of myself as a reasonably
competent programmer of 25 years but its a bit scary
coming over from windows.
I do feel that this could be the real killer ap for
non MS systems and I get the impression there are
other migrants out there who are suffering from not
being able to get this working.
I think I'd got to gtk+-2.3.6 before I balked at
another package upgrade required!

A list of the recommended support libs (glibda/gtk
etc) beyond the standard RH9/RedCarpet.mono for a
certain snapshot would be useful for me.

I'll have another go from scratch later and try and
make a list of what I do..

Tom
