The next release should be on red-carpet to make it easier for people to
run.  Keep in mind compiling 0.1 versions of software from source is not
for the inexperienced.

All the dependencies should be listed in the README file.  Also, running
the configure script shows a report at the end of what you have
installed vs. what is required.  It sounds like you installed
gtksourceview-0.9 which is an unstable version and depends on
gtk+-2.3.x, which is where you ran into trouble.  I will add this to the
README so this does not happen to others.

If the README and FAQS files do not answer your question please let us
know so we can add the right information to them.
