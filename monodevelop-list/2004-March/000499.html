<PRE>A couple comments, just from a quick first read through.

1) Keep in mind that regardless of what we end up doing, one goal of the
project in the past has been to maintain portability with SharpDevelop.
Now, obviously if your project requires some C functionality to be in
place, and that C functionality hasnt been ported, it wont work
regardless, but for general building of competely standalone managed
applications, we should be able to build on linux with our build system,
and copy the project to windows, and build using #D.

2) Under the current setup for language abstraction, each project *has*
to be in one language, and there exist Language Bindings that know how
to build/execute/etc said project. That is an abstraction I would like
to keep. Modification of that idea is what we should be going for. Even
a function such as OutputMake or something might be required.

3) One thing that I would like to use as a usability test case, is
MonoDevelop itself. MonoDevelop most likely has one of the more complex
C# builds around, as it builds a lot of C#, some C, does a lot of tricky
stuff to allow make run, and make install. I think we need to make sure
that whatever system we design allows for a 'MonoDevelop' project,
because currently that is impossible.

4) As for web building, after speaking with gonzalo briefly in boston
about it, hosting our own 'xsp' inside a different AppDomain in
MonoDevelop is most likely going to be the way to go.


Just some quick thoughts, more to come later. :)
