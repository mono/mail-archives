<PRE>Hello Martin,

I've helped a user with a gtksourceview-sharp issue, presumably in
Mandrake 9.2, but i don't sure if it belongs to programs not bundled
with Mandrake or if it was some user customization, since the source of
pain were in a user directory. He was trying to run MonoDevelop, and
first i thought about addressing this to the MD list, but i think it
fits better in gtksourceview-sharp.

Anyways here's the issue, detected after installing gtksourceview-sharp
successfully.

$ pwd
/home/user/.gnome
$ rgrep -r application-info/x-cs
application-info/user.applications:     mime_types=application/x-cs
application-info/user.applications:     mime_types=application/x-cs
application-info/user.applications:     mime_types=application/x-cs
application-info/user.applications:     mime_types=application/x-cs
mime-info/user.mime:application/x-cs
mime-info/user.keys:application/x-cs

The user deleted the offending files and MD worked ok. Well, it should
be a matter of just replacing application/x-cs with text/x-csharp, but
he deleted things and worked. It would be helpful for gnome newbies to
have this somewhere (FAQ, INSTALL?) in the gtksourceview-sharp
documentation, webpage, etc.


{{...a bunch of troubleshooting...}}

&lt;{PRE}&gt; eureko, done! It works!
&lt;{PRE}&gt; may thanks, sorry for your time

&lt;eureko&gt; {PRE}: could you tell me exactly where you fixed the thing?
&lt;{PRE}&gt; yes
&lt;eureko&gt; i'd like to have included it in the faq
&lt;{PRE}&gt; I had all that mime_types=application/x-cs in several files
&lt;{PRE}&gt; and I deleted them all!
&lt;-- steved has quit (Leaving)
&lt;eureko&gt; and that's why it worked with root
&lt;{PRE}&gt; these where the files:
&lt;eureko&gt; where did go finally gtksourceview-sharp?
