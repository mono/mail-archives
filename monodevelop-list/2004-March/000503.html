<PRE>Some comments about the launch browser idea:

It is probably going to be pretty sticky to detect when the browser
closes. What if you open up a new window in that browser, etc.

So, what I would suggest is having our own mini-browser. This way, we
can keep track of where the browser is, etc.

Doing this has another advantage -- we can provide many services that
would otherwise be very hard to do.

For example, one thing that would be interesting is a built-in ViewState
decoder. Also, a built-in session state viewer and cookie viewer would
be very helpful. What this would look like is you have a menu item (only
in the browser)

Show ViewState...

It would bring up a dialog that has a treeview:

__item_a     int     5
..

Much like the view in the debugger.

You can sorta do this with a trace page, however, with something like
this you could provide additional services (for example, if you have an
arraylist, viewing the items). Also, you could provide functionality to
change a value (helpful if you want to change the viewstate to check
security issues).

IMHO, a `regular' browser is not going to be able to provide the
services a developer really needs when working on a web page. Of course,
it should still be possible to aim your browser at the xsp setup, but I
think that we are going to want to provide more services than that.
