<PRE>If we use .sources files with the @responsefile syntax of csc/mcs, this
would not be too hard. I don't think this is going to boil down to a
technical problem...

I like this idea as long as it doesn't impose too much hassle for either

having to maintain makefiles in addition to nant (or msbuild if you ever
switch to that).
