Yes, we are very interested.

&gt;<i> - Have you looked at the new file templates yet?

Not yet, but it is on my list of things to do. I have been catching up
at work from my vacation, so have been a bit busy.

&gt;<i> - I've fixed some bugs in the projects layer

I was not aware, I will look into this.

&gt;<i> - I've added a new functionality to the language backend: expression

</I>&gt;<i>    I changed the algorithm it works much better now.

</I>
The namespace change in #Refactory shouldnt have happened, however I
stick by the core and base namespace changes.

Part of the problem I am having working with this codebase is the
over-namespacing of all of it. Not only do you have 2 'toplevel'
namespaces, 'ICSharpCode.SharpDevelop' and 'ICSharpCode', there seems to
be a lot of seeming incoherence in the namespacing, for example:

To use a service, i have to do:

using MonoDevelop.Core.Services (To get the ServiceManager)
using MonoDevelop.Services (To get the actual service types)

The initial change is part of a bigger sweeping namespace
reorganization, of which we are happy to work with you to get somewhere
both applications are happy with.
