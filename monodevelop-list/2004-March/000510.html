I am going with not caring too much, the idea of the in MD browser being
all hyped up for development would be to develop/test internal testing
webpages, like stuff served off localhost. your proxy, certs, passwords,
etc shouldnt be too relevant there. The font stuff maybe, but i think
gtkmozembed picks that up properly.

Yes, I hope to grab a drink or some food with shaver at some point as
see what we might need to interact with mozilla at a lower level.
