</I>Yes, we will have one. It is a pretty hard control though.

</I>Well, I am not sure how much this could work. The design model for Gtk#
is so different than the one for SWF, i am not sure how we could make
this work. For example, swf has no concept of a box model.

However, in terms of things like the [Description] attribute, or
attributes to say `this is a color, show a color picker', we might be
able to do. We have yet to truely start working on a Gtk# designer. One
of the Ximian guys is going to work on that in a few months.

&gt;<i> btw. a property grid is useful for the forms designer too :)
</I>Very much so.
