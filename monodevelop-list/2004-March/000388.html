Hmm, apparently Todd committed this.  I just cleaned up the coding style
and added you as one of the authors since you've done quite a bit on it
now.  Not a huge deal but in the future it would be great if you could
use the same style as the file as you are working on.  In this case
space before () and in if {} else {} consistently.

Also, it would be helpful to include a ChangeLog with some more details
of your changes.  For example, I don't use nautilus and don't know what
you meant above.

Thanks.
