<PRE>Hi, I searched the forum for this, to no avail; my apologies if I missed it.

This is monodevelop 4.2,2 running on Ubuntu 13.10.   It was installed from
OpenSuse repos.   

So, a common debugging scenario is debugging one's C# code when it's running
in some sort of process, e.g. Apache, xsp, etc.    I'd normally expect to be
able to set breakpoints, attach to the process, then initiate some action
that causes the code execution to hit a breakpoint.

However, there's no 'Attach To' item on the 'Run' menu.   There's a 'Debug
Application' menu item, but this seems to want to open a dialog box that
wants to locate a binary on disk to launch; not what's needed here.

Some casual Googling suggests that perhaps some procedure involving the mono
--debugger-agent switch can be leveraged to achieve this end?    But...I
can't seem to find anything that describes the procedure in enough detail
such that I can understand it.    I've searched mono documentation also,
but...it seems there's not a lot of information about the debugger (I'm
assuming the soft debugger is what I want here; I've read multiple posts
suggesting that mono's integration with gdb is not the way to go).   

I'd be very grateful for any pointers to an explicit description of what one
does to achieve this.

thanks,
Don
