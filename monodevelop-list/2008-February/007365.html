<PRE>We have 2 choices, make a complete wizard with more than 1 page ( 2 at least
and 4 at max).
Or only choose only few things to have all in one page.
Both have advantages and disadvantages.

- Have all in one page and reduce number of click is always more user
fiendly.
- Too many things on a single page make it unreadable
So we have to balance.
Reduce number of features and have one single page or increase it and have
multi-page.

The question is really simple in fact, Do we need all this features or not.
For me wizard must be something to not loose time to have to rewrite
everytime the same thing but if we loose time to search in all options/page
it will not be ok. Most of user will do customization in code. Most of time
when I do a class, I do not know how it will evolved in future. I just know
basic things.

Yes multi-page is better because reusable but in point of view of user they
do not care because they just want and easy and simple thing which do a lot
of things... ;)

Imo, single page will be good because simple and easier is always more user
friendly else they will do it directely in code.

Anyway, I will follow what is the end decision.

II have try to see what is the solution choose by others but I have only
found what eclipse have done:
- eclipse single page
- VS2005 : ? ( nothing I guess)
- Kdevelop : ? ( nothing I guess)
...
