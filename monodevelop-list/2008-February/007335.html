It looks mostly the same as gdl I see. I was just talking with the gdl
guys on having the grip inside the tabs, so that you didn't have to
write the labels at two places. (As in
<A HREF="http://monodevelop.com/files/f/f9/MacMonoDevelop.png">http://monodevelop.com/files/f/f9/MacMonoDevelop.png</A> where &quot;Solution&quot; is
written in the tab as well as the grip)
Is this possible from your dock?

I guess there is no easy way to use this from python. Is there a
tobinary compiler for C#, so it could be runnable with ctypes?
