<PRE>Hi all,

as stated in a previous mail, we (the Sharpdevelop team) decided to 
ask the FSF for their view of licensing matters regarding Monodevelop 
and Sharpdevelop. Here ist their answer which we accept as 
authoritative:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Code derived from GPL code must be licensed under the GPL.  
</I>Additonal
&gt;<i> permissions may be added at the time of distribution or at any

&gt;<i> time.  It's fine for them to license code that they add under some
</I>&gt;<i> GPL-compatible but more permissive license.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *	A change in licensing of GPL'd software is not possible without 
</I>the 
&gt;<i> &gt; permission of the copyright holders of all code involved from our 
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; understanding.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's right with respect to the work as a whole.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, it seems like the MonoDevelop people can do what they 
</I>propose
&gt;<i> to do.  That is, they can license their new code under the X11 
</I>license
&gt;<i> (note: make sure they pick a version of said license which is 
</I>actually
&gt;<i> GPL-compatible -- the most recent XFree86 license isn't).  This 
</I>doesn't
&gt;<i> change a whole lot wrt the work as a whole (including plug-ins) 
</I>until
&gt;<i> they replace all of the GPL code.  So long as there is some code in
</I>&gt;<i> there which is GPL, they can't start making proprierary plug-ins. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, there are two ways to get the permission of all
</I>&gt;<i> copyright holders:  1. Ask all copyright holders.  2. Reduce the 
</I>number
&gt;<i> of copyright holders to those you already have permission from.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note that the structure of the code as a whole is copyrighted, so 
</I>their
&gt;<i> replacement should probably not proceed by going class-by-class and
</I>&gt;<i> implementing each method of each class -- instead, they ought to 
</I>sit
&gt;<i> down and start rewriting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Their choice is a shame for software freedom, since what they want 
</I>to do
&gt;<i> doesn't protect software freedom as much as the GPL.  But the good 
</I>news
&gt;<i> is that you'll be able to freely merge in code from MonoDevelop 
</I>into
&gt;<i> SharpDevelop.  This includes proprietary versions of SharpDevelop.  
</I>You
&gt;<i> should mention this on the mailing list, because if they think that
</I>&gt;<i> they'll stop you from making proprietary versions by converting to 
</I>the
&gt;<i> X11 license, they are mistaken indeed.
