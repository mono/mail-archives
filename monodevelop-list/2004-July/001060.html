That is obvious, when it comes to YOUR code, and YOUR distribution of 
#develop, but absolutely non-obvious for so called derivative work.  
Are you implying that you want to sell MonoDevelop as well to YOUR 
profit, that would be outrageous!

</I>
Nobody is asking YOU to relicense ANYTHING, they are just relicensing 
THEIR OWN GOODS, is that so difficult to understand?  YOU did not write 
the code that John and Todd wrote, so it does not belong to 
YOU/#develop, it's as simple as that.  They may have to provide their 
code in a GPL'ed version but that does not make it YOUR code!
