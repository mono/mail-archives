</I>&gt;<i>- Derivatives of the existing GPL code, cannot be re-licensed can it?
</I>&gt;<i>(editing a large part of the file will still leave it as GPL only)

No, GPL cannot be changed to a less-restrictive license.

&gt;<i>Arguably, this could apply to the whole thing, or just per-assembly,
</I>&gt;<i>or who knows for sure.  Does that meet your 'explicitly using the MIT
</I>&gt;<i>X11 license on all new code' requirement?
</I>&gt;<i>- Individuals copyrights on GPL code allows them to
</I>&gt;<i>re-license/dual-license what they wrote
</I>
Unless it is already based on GPL-ed code, in which case relicensing is not 
an option.

&gt;<i>- Having multiple licenses in a project just causes confusion in my opinion
</I>
Definitely, unless you had a policy in place at the very beginning of the 
project. And &quot;existing code has license A, code that is injected in 
existing code is license B&quot;...

&gt;<i>- Anything submitted as MIT/X11 can just be put into MD as GPL, right?
</I>
See dotGNU for example who were able to reuse Mono's BCL library code.
