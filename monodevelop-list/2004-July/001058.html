<PRE>Hello

This version of MonoDevelop is not that stable.
I can get the same problem i reported few says ago about CTRL-Z (UNDO).
When i do that my work roolback until the last save point and don't the
last operation ... this is not very goood to incresse the Developement.

Anther thing tha happen a lot is the Code-Completation.
There are many ways to crash the monodevelop with Code-Completation. When
i press dot in a object, sometimes i get the word in gray and nothing more
and i  have to delete the Gray Word after i get to my choice.

Sometimes, the Code-Completation just don't work. I press dot and get
anything.

Other time i dot that and simply the MonoDevelop exits.

I think that a good way to resolve this bugs is having a DEBUG WINDOW in
the About Menu that we can paste what is happening to this forum to help
you undestand our problem.

Another thing is when the MonoDevelop exists with an Exception, shows a
window with the Exception for us to paste to this forum or even create a
system like M$ that send the information all over internet.

I know that all this kind of problems i can download the source and try to
resolve it myself ... but i don't know how i get the source.... or even
from where to begin resolving the problems.
In the MonoDevelop Web Site should have a contributer guide for people
like me can  help you guys developing a good IDE for FreeSoftware
implementation os .NET tecnology.
