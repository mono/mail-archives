</I>&gt;<i> of a legal text is not enough.

Um, thanks for insulting me.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) For your project, set up a proper process for assignment and
</I>&gt;<i> attribution of copyrights. Painful as this may look at first sight,
</I>&gt;<i> it will save a lot of trouble later on. Recent legal developments
</I>&gt;<i> have proven this. And we may assume this to get more of an issue in

In case their is some confusion:
 - I am ok with SharpDevelop's position with AddIns, I just think
   it is the wrong choice.  I have no problem licensing everything
   I wrote to do with MD under those terms.  I only think that
   independent 3rd party AddIns that are not part of the Core/Base
   be allowed to be licensed on their own terms.  (Think NVidia drivers)
 - I am not asking them to change their license, or position on AddIns.
   That is for them and others to decide based on what their goals and
   business plan is.
 - This is only one of many reasons I decided to stop work on MonoDevelop.
 - I have as much familiarity of all aspects of the GPL as anyone else does
   that is not a lawyer.  I have looked into it carefully in the past, long
   before I was around here.  It is an acceptable license in my opinion, just
   unclear on a few points that will hopefully be addressed in the next
   revision (if there is one).
 - Last, this does not have to be a sad situation.  There are very large open
   source projects that have a similar licensing situation and are widely
   successful.  MonoDevelop and SharpDevelop can be the next, and I hope
   they will.
