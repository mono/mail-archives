<PRE>As posted on July 17th by Bernhard, we received a reply from the FSF 
regarding the licensing issues discussed on this list. A PDF of the FSF 
reply is also available at
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.dotnetgerman.com/blogs/rackechs/PermaLink.aspx?guid=2c7afb">http://www.dotnetgerman.com/blogs/rackechs/PermaLink.aspx?guid=2c7afb</A>
53-154e-4589-8c86-6140586b7225&gt;. The SharpDevelop team accepts this answer 
as final and authoritative in this matter. We will continue in using the 
GPL for our code as we strongly believe in the value of Open Source Software.

We are happy to see that MonoDevelop can add their own add-ins using the 
X11 license the team prefers. MonoDevelop is in our eyes an important 
factor in the success of Mono and we wish it well.

Last but not least I would like to offer my apologies for a discussion that 
went over board on a topic that is as controversial as it is vital to the 
Open Source community. Efficient and professional resolution of such 
conflicts is of essence for the future of Open Source. Now let us all 
continue what we know to do best - write good code.
