</I>&gt;<i> Example 1: you have a MIT-licensed snippet of a search algorithm and tweak
</I>&gt;<i> it so it is a search strategy (needs to implement a few interfaces etc)
</I>&gt;<i> that works with #develop. Fine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Example 2: someone writes a search strategy specifically for #develop
</I>&gt;<i> which
</I>&gt;<i> means it links against GPL'ed code in the first place. No way you can
</I>&gt;<i> license that new search strategy MIT.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Actually you CAN release the code in Example 2 as MIT. You just cannot
ship it with the code the it is GPL'd against.

Assume that I write a component for #develop, which statically links with
#develop. If I don't actually ship it with any of the code that is
GPL(which would happen if it was statically linked as a binary), but
rather I ship it as some Source Code (not a binary), it does not have to
be GPL. It can be MIT/X11 code, and designed to statically link against
the GPL Code.

The 'Tainting' of non-GPL licensed code only happens when you ship that
code as a linked binary. As source, different files can retain their
different licenses.

So:

(MIT Source) + (GPL Source) == (MIT Source) + (BSD + Source)
(MIT Binary) [StaticLinked] (GPL Binary) == GPL Binary
