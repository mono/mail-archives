</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What release is 'This release'?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>You are right .. this is not a release .. was a bad choice of words ... 
sorry...

&gt;&gt;<i>I can get the same problem i reported few says ago about CTRL-Z (UNDO).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>When i do that my work roolback until the last save point and don't the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>last operation ... this is not very goood to incresse the Developement.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This is fixed in 0.5.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>No it's not .. i have tha same problem and i have the 0.5 version

&gt;<i>We dont use forums for bug tracking, as its a useless bug tracker in our
</I>&gt;<i>opinion. We use bugzilla.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>You can access our bugzilla at <A HREF="http://bugzilla.ximian.com">http://bugzilla.ximian.com</A> .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Please please please please file bugs there. This mailing list is for
</I>&gt;<i>the discussion of the development of MonoDevelop, and other things, but
</I>&gt;<i>not a bug dumping zone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yep .. i know that and that good, but we have to run from console to get 
the error .. usually i don't run from console and the error happen, 
that's why i'm saying that the MonoDevelop could be connected to 
Bugzilla and import all the data to help you guys.

&gt;&gt;<i>Another thing is when the MonoDevelop exists with an Exception, shows a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>window with the Exception for us to paste to this forum or even create a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>system like M$ that send the information all over internet.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This would be great, we are working to hook into some gnome
</I>&gt;<i>functionality that already does this (bugbuddy). We would love a patch.
</I>&gt;<i>It's your time to show off dude! :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I'm currently developing an application with Mono and i need a good IDE, 
and MonoDevelop id the best for Linux. I will try help you guys too, for 
you to help me.

&gt;&gt;<i>I know that all this kind of problems i can download the source and try to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>resolve it myself ... but i don't know how i get the source.... or even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>from where to begin resolving the problems.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>In the MonoDevelop Web Site should have a contributer guide for people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>like me can  help you guys developing a good IDE for FreeSoftware
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>implementation os .NET tecnology.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Well. Since you mention it, the anonymous SVN server is mentioned pretty
</I>&gt;<i>clearly on the website, and again, patches are welcome, help us write
</I>&gt;<i>the guide you think you and other potential new contributors need!
</I>&gt;<i>Having a good open source project is more than just having good hackers,
</I>&gt;<i>we need good documentation writers, good bugwranglers, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I will try again and paste here my frustations ... ... i'm not agains't 
you ... i'm with you.
