<PRE>Stop crying like a little baby, YOU give OOS a bad name, and the FSF 
has a well known political background that here in the US would have 
put you in jail not too long ago (I am originally from Switzerland, so 
I'm very much familiar with what background you guys are coming from!).

If your father is a lawyer that have him analyze the IP issue @ hand, 
since the IP ownership is the only issue that is @ hand (as Todd also 
continuously restated).  And for your mail to FSF: from an independent 
point of view: there are many mistakes in there, and I would be 
professionally ashamed writing a mail like that (from a presentation 
and wording point of view).

BTW: I'm not involved in the MD project, I'm just an bystander 
interested in Mono and MD, (getting less and less interested in #D even 
though I was liking the product before, but now I have to stay away 
from it, and must say I'm more then happy that M$ is now publishing 
free VS 2005 versions).
