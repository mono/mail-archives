<PRE>Asking for clarifications by the FSF is &quot;in bad taste&quot;? If you are more 
competent in (GPL) licensing issues than the FSF, so be it. But we will 
publish their findings here once we receive them.

Until then (which I hope is rather soon), consider our position to be 
different than yours on this matter.

</I>&gt;<i>3rd paragraph, 1st sentence:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;MonoDdvevelop (<A HREF="http://www.monodevelop.com">http://www.monodevelop.com</A>) is a fork of SharpDevelop
</I>&gt;<i>branching off release 0.94 of SharpDevelop&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>it was 0.98, but this is minor, just informing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Same paragraph, next sentence:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;MonoDevelop MonoDevelop now wants to change license to the X11 license
</I>&gt;<i>which led to some debate between the developers of both teams.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Never once was this suggested, and many times it was explained that
</I>&gt;<i>MonoDevelop would continue to be GPL until/unless it was rewritten
</I>&gt;<i>completely (which was also noted to be highly unlikely (as in, not gonna
</I>&gt;<i>happen unlikely)). All that was mentioned was that *MY* personal
</I>&gt;<i>contributions, the IP that I own, would be relicensed to the MIT X11
</I>&gt;<i>license, but distributed under the terms of the GPL. There was also some
</I>&gt;<i>questions if we should require future contributions to be submitted with
</I>&gt;<i>similar constraints, and if we should look at getting past contributions
</I>&gt;<i>licensed in the same way. Again, MD would stay GPL, and the #D codebase
</I>&gt;<i>is GPL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>2nd page, 1st bullet point:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;...without explicitly choosing a license, code derived from GPL'd code
</I>&gt;<i>is 'license free' seems incorrect.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>All I stated was that it was not explicitly licensed, which is bad in
</I>&gt;<i>general. I would assume everyone agrees.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>2nd page, 2nd bullet point:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;A change in licensing of GPL'd software is not possible without the
</I>&gt;<i>permission of the copyright holders of all code involved from our
</I>&gt;<i>understanding.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I never even suggested that the software's license would change. Read
</I>&gt;<i>above. Just that my contributions would. And last time I checked, I was
</I>&gt;<i>the sole copyright holder of my contributions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Secondly, a minor mistake - don't take German language for German company.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here in Austria we also speak German as a matter of fact. Oh, and by the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; way: my company only acts as the copyright holder - all assignments 
</I>&gt;<i> will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tranferred to Mike once he chooses so. This is only legal protection for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mike, because he is a student and with Germany being heavy on 
</I>&gt;<i> not-so-easily
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; defendable injunctions, I decided to offer a legal shield. Which is cheap,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because my father IS a lawyer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I apologize for thinking ASP was a German company, I now understand that
</I>&gt;<i>it is an Austrian company.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>And I am happy to hear that your father is a lawyer, I hope that
</I>&gt;<i>profession is as lucrative in Austria as it is in America and Canada.
</I>&gt;<i>Kudos.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I thought we we were handling this issue (which even might turn out to 
</I>&gt;<i> be a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; non-issue) above-USENET flamewar level, but your recent blog post has me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thinking that I might be wrong on assuming that we deal with this issue
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; professionally.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It already has turned into a non-issue. As I stated in my blog, as far
</I>&gt;<i>as MonoDevelop is concerned, it is a moot point. And as far as dealing
</I>&gt;<i>with this issue professionally, I don't think that you and your team has
</I>&gt;<i>been in the least bit professional over this, and 'MonoDevelop Brother'
</I>&gt;<i>thread that happened here a couple weeks ago. Keeping that thread alive
</I>&gt;<i>here was just in poor taste.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Had ASP wished to be professional, they would have not reached for the
</I>&gt;<i>FSF within 24 hours of this being mentioned, they would have attempted
</I>&gt;<i>to contact me off the list, which was not done, as I recall, I attempted
</I>&gt;<i>to contact you off the list, and was handled very tersely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Taking your concerns to the FSF is just in poor taste. Regardless of
</I>&gt;<i>what the FSF says, it is just their opinion, and not actually a concern
</I>&gt;<i>of mine. The FSF is not, will not, and can not be the judge, jury and
</I>&gt;<i>executioner in this discussion. But, I am just a developer, not a
</I>&gt;<i>lawyer, so I guess maybe the MonoDevelop team needs more word wranglers,
</I>&gt;<i>and less code wranglers to deal with this in the future. And again, as I
</I>&gt;<i>said before, you can stop wasting the FSF's time, as it is a moot
</I>&gt;<i>discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>And what I said on my blog was just that. What I said on my blog. It is
</I>&gt;<i>my space, in which I can say whatever I choose to say. And after just
</I>&gt;<i>re-reading it, at no point do I feel I flamed anyone. I merely expressed
</I>&gt;<i>my exasperation at the 'professional' decisions reached by the ASP team.
</I>&gt;<i>If you feel that any piece of it is inaccurate, please contact me off
</I>&gt;<i>this list, and I will listen to your objections, and either edit out the
</I>&gt;<i>inaccuracies, or post small footnotes from you that explain exactly why
</I>&gt;<i>I am wrong, unprofessional, and just generally a bad guy. This isn't the
</I>&gt;<i>first time I have been told that I kill kittens, and if I do things
</I>&gt;<i>right, it won't be the last time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Final words: we submit to the outcome from FSF analysis, so why doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; everyone here hold their flame-breath and stick to &quot;we have a disagreement
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on licensing we want to resolve professionally&quot;. To clear up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; misconceptions: we are not threatening anybody, we don't intend to mess
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with somebody's IP, it's just that this discussion has come to a point
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; where it should be resolved professionally - so other OS projects don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have to go through this process but can build on the results.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>We don't have a disagreement on licensing, at all, we have a
</I>&gt;<i>disagreement on if the GPL allows code under a different, but still GPL
</I>&gt;<i>compat, license to be bundled with GPL code given that the entire
</I>&gt;<i>product is released under the terms of the GPL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>As far as I, and the MonoDevelop team is concerned, this issue is
</I>&gt;<i>closed, done, finished, etc. There is no need for anymore discussion on
</I>&gt;<i>it, as we have decided how to best move forward, and will concentrate on
</I>&gt;<i>code wrangling, not word wrangling. We have software to develop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Good night,
</I>&gt;<i>
