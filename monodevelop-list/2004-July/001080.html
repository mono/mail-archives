I'm just an interested bystander (a programmer and recently user of
MonoDevelop) but please I would like to see the FSF's response.
Perhaps some other people would too?

If you could post a URL or email me privately that would be great.

Frankly, I don't see what's wrong with posting the FSF's response
here; this is where it belongs.  Those that don't want to read it
don't have to.  But anyway just as long as I can see it somewhere.

Jonathan
ps. I like MonoDevelop; keep up the good work!
