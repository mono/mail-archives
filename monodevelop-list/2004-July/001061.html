No. How come you thought that?

</I>&gt;<i>Nobody is asking YOU to relicense ANYTHING, they are just relicensing 
</I>&gt;<i>THEIR OWN GOODS, is that so difficult to understand?  YOU did not write 
</I>&gt;<i>the code that John and Todd wrote, so it does not belong to YOU/#develop, 
</I>&gt;<i>it's as simple as that.  They may have to provide their code in a GPL'ed

We have sent an inquiry to the FSF - all non-lawyers please hold off your 
comments until we have a professional feedback. This starts to get nowhere.
