</I>Trying to follow your words and trying to help new contributors and help 
myself i'm now trying to use MonoDevelop 0.5 to compile the SVN version.

For now i'm havind some strange problems that i did not get any responses:
- Why you have many file .cs.in ?? those file are need  to compile like 
AssemblyInfo.cs.in. I renamed from .cs.in to .in and  the compile give 
me no errors.
- Why i cant create the DLL file or Where the DLL file is goind after 
compile ??? It is not in bin/Debug but the Build give me no error .... 
strange !!!!!

For now i have this 2 problems .... after this maybe i will have more 
... :( for exemple ... after get the DLL files for the modules .. i 
leave that in the bin/Debug directory of the modules or copy to another 
place !?!?!?



One thing that will be very nive is when we open a Solution / Project we 
get an output window with the operation that the MonoDevelop do to and 
all the files he is loading ... Sometimes when i try to open the 
Solution Monodevelop.Core a get nothing ... and no error message. I try 
to run from console .. and i get nothing too.... strange ... very 
strange.....
