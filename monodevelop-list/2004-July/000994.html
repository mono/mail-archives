</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and the add elements to the content model. This is only an example, but

What I'm actually questioning is if this is really useful. It would be a
hell of a lot of work, close to something like writing a complete GUI
toolkit. And in the end, this &quot;XML description of a GUI to native
Toolkit&quot; thing would result in
a) different binaries for different GUI toolkits used 
   (mapping done before deployment)
b) the need to ship the application together with the library
   (mapping done on the client)
Case a) kind of defeats the whole .NET thing (different binaries once
again) and case b) would not really be that different from shipping the
application with a GUI toolkit like GTK+ included.

So the benefit would IMHO only occur in a) by using native widgets
everywhere with reduced effort for the programmer. But the effort to
provide this might be tremendous.
