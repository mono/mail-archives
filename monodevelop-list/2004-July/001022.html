While I think everyone agrees that derivative works would fall under
the GPL.  I think the main issue is how are 'derivative work' and
'linking' defined in this case.  Now, certainly the opinion of you and
the other SharpDevelop team members is influential, but unfortunately
I don't think it is clearly enough defined in the current GPL version,
especially regarding managed-code like C# and Java.  Defining
derivative works is a can-of-worms in itself.

The only solution is to consult the lawyers. In this case , it
probably means it is far more likely someone wishing to submit his
work under the MIT license will choose not to do so. I can't think of
any reason anyone could justify legal fees in order to volunteer their
time and effort.  Now there is nothing wrong with that, its not likely
we can solve it here, and I would not even try.  If you guys feel that
it is not possible, I would tend to respect that, even though I am
fairly sure that is at least questionable.

Please do not respond to me, only to the list and if you think it will
benefit others.  I do not need to hear anymore about the subject.
