Oh boy.  I think there are a bunch of issues in this, which in the end
might not be worth messing with.

(Insert I am not a lawyer disclaimer.)

- Derivatives of the existing GPL code, cannot be re-licensed can it?
(editing a large part of the file will still leave it as GPL only) 
Arguably, this could apply to the whole thing, or just per-assembly,
or who knows for sure.  Does that meet your 'explicitly using the MIT
X11 license on all new code' requirement?
- Individuals copyrights on GPL code allows them to
re-license/dual-license what they wrote
- Having multiple licenses in a project just causes confusion in my opinion
- Anything submitted as MIT/X11 can just be put into MD as GPL, right?
- Subjecting ourselves to some sort of licensing conspiracy theory

Since I dont see anything preventing you from submitting everything as
X11, is it worth doing anything else?   I really don't like the idea
of some things being X11 and some GPL.

P.S. I am a fan of the MIT/X11 license, and not really a proponent of the GPL
