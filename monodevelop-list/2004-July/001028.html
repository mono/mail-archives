<PRE>Well, this a really active thread, so I feel as an active user of MD 
that I may add my 2 cents... and I want Todd to continue writting code :)

All derivative works from a GPLed project should be at least license 
under GPL. This does not mean that it could not be also license MIT/X11 
or anything else, event commercial license.

IMHO, dual licensing GPL and MIT/X11 _all new code_ added around the 
#develop core, without worrying if that code should be considered 
derivative or not, will solve your problem without a lawyer. If this 
code link to or are considered derivative of existing code, you respect 
the requirement of the GPL by also licensing _your_ code GPL. But the 
same code taken alone could be use either under the GPL license or the 
MIT/X11 license. This is your choice to leave other developers use one 
or the other license, even both :).

If a part of dual-licensed code is not usable without a GPL only part 
from #develop, the dual licensing will be useless but do not hurt. At 
the opposite, the code dual-licensed is not limited by the GPL.

That fulfil all your requirements:
- respect the GPL
- permit reuse in the framework

Any objections ?
(Please no 'political' matter around the GPL, licensing GPL do not makes 
your code worse and I really hope we could all return to writing 
open-source code right now !)
