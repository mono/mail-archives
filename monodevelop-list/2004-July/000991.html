Yes, but that wont help you with the problems complex widgets will give
you. What if we have two toolkits and the mentioned listviews, and in
one toolkit the concept is like
&gt;<i> ListView mlv = new ListView();
</I>&gt;<i> mlv.add(&quot;This is a line&quot;);
</I>but in the other one you would have to implement full MVC pattern for
it, eg.
&gt;<i> ListContentModel mlc = new ListContentModel();
</I>&gt;<i> ListView mlv = new ListView(mlc);
</I>&gt;<i> ListController lc = new ListController(mlv);
</I>and the add elements to the content model. This is only an example, but
how would you map this together? Your mapper would have to be really
smart to sort such things out.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; In the case of Microsoft, they probably won't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; support GTK widgets directly, but that doesn't mean you cannot create a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; user control to implement a GTK widget and then map that widget's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; namespace node to your user control when the XML is parsed to the native
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; language.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Would you parse the XML and translate it before shipment or on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; client? In the first case this could be possible, but in the latter it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would result in the complexity problems I described below.
</I>
Could you answer me on that? I'm not really sure if we're talking about
the same thing ;-)
