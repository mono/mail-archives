<PRE>Hey,

	As all of you are most likely aware, the last couple days we have had a
lot of licensing discussion on this list. Thankfully, this should be
basically mostly over.

	The licensing model we are using in MonoDevelop is going to be changing
over the next little bit. However, right now, not determinations have
been made as to exactly what the licensing model will be.

	Regardless of this, as of now, all new code contributions require
copyright assignment. Initially this copyright assignment will be made
to me personally (I am not 100% comfortable with this, however, this is
our only option). This assignment, however, is made with the proviso
that I will be transferring all of the copyright of your code, and my
code, to a soon to be setup Not-For-Profit (501c3) (i think)
corporation. This NFP will hold the copyright on all new code in
MonoDevelop.

	We will not be asking for copyright assignment on old code, and the
license on the old MonoDevelop code will stand in the license it is in
(mostly GPL, with a spot of MIT X11 from Novell, and the code I have
contributed).

	More news will follow later as decisions are made.

--Todd
