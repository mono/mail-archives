</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I think that using namespaces fixes the problems described.  You have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; basic namespace for &quot;standard&quot; widgets such as buttons and labels, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; then each targeted widget would reside in a targeted namespace.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Yes that would fix it. But without being to negative I think this would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; result in a very limited set of widgets (see xhtml+css). This would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; massively limit the possibilities of the developer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if each namespace represented a meta-tag that mapped to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implementation-specific complexity, perhaps the namespaces could be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; grouped to represent &quot;shelles&quot; of dependancy.  eg.  LCD is the basic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; piece and each shell builds on that.  Toolkits can be members of each
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; namespace.  So, if my toolkit chose getLabel or toText or whatever,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; being a member of the TO-TEXT attribute of whatever meta-tag holds
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; label info...  well, then it would be available in a concrete form at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; runtime.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but that wont help you with the problems complex widgets will give
</I>&gt;<i> you. What if we have two toolkits and the mentioned listviews, and in
</I>&gt;<i> one toolkit the concept is like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ListView mlv = new ListView();
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mlv.add(&quot;This is a line&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> but in the other one you would have to implement full MVC pattern for
</I>&gt;<i> it, eg.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ListContentModel mlc = new ListContentModel();
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ListView mlv = new ListView(mlc);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ListController lc = new ListController(mlv);
</I>&gt;<i> and the add elements to the content model. This is only an example, but
</I>&gt;<i> how would you map this together? Your mapper would have to be really
</I>&gt;<i> smart to sort such things out.
</I>
the MVC controller would be a shell above the listview controller which
would be a shell above the (possibly native) text control that actually
recieves the message.  setText in this case I think.

MVC would provide a good abstraction layer for these shells, I think.

Hey, I'm not saying the necessary resultant XML files would be any
simple, quick, nor easy.  But thinking in the abstract... well, there's
enough indication that it would be a good thing ;-)
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; In the case of Microsoft, they probably won't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; support GTK widgets directly, but that doesn't mean you cannot create a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; user control to implement a GTK widget and then map that widget's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; namespace node to your user control when the XML is parsed to the native
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; language.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Would you parse the XML and translate it before shipment or on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; client? In the first case this could be possible, but in the latter it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; would result in the complexity problems I described below.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Could you answer me on that? I'm not really sure if we're talking about
</I>&gt;<i> the same thing ;-)
</I>this would be the same deploy/reserve question you would have to answer
prior to going live anyway.   If it needs deployed, then you'd package
the necessary meta-meta descriptors.  eg. index to local or remote
descriptors.

if the description of the gui was &quot;client-apparant&quot; -INO needed client
customization- then certainly pieces of the XML could be parsed out
according to a map and pushed out to the client as it loaded the URI.

Is this what you were talking about ?   ;-)
