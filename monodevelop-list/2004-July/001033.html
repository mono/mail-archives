<PRE>Let's ask the FSF to clarify - by giving specific examples of code that is 
contributed to MD:

* an existing code file that is governed by the GPL is modified (rewrite of 
a method)
* a new method/property/... that is added to an existing code file that is 
governed by the GPL
* adding a new code file that implements interfaces governed by the GPL to 
an assembly that otherwise consists of GPL code only
* writing an addin that implements interfaces, calls methods, links against 
code that is governed by the GPL (you won't be able to write an addin that 
doesn't need any of these)

No-one argues that independent UI (widgets) or platform (ie Mono Debugger 
infrastructure) assemblies are in question.

</I>&gt;<i>To put it insanely clearly. If this licensing issue is not resolved, I

</I>&gt;<i>let me tell you. However, regardless *I* will continue to review
</I>&gt;<i>patches, provide help, triage bugzilla, and create code that is
</I>&gt;<i>absolutely beyond a doubt able to be useful, hopefully in the methods
</I>&gt;<i>described by Miguel.
