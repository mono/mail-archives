<PRE>We never said that our point of view is of &quot;fundamental ethical&quot; 
proportions - it is strictly focused on legality.

</I>&gt;<i>  13.   In addition, as a special exception, AlphaSierraPapa gives

</I>&gt;<i>modified versions of Microsoft .NET library that use the same license as the
</I>&gt;<i>Microsoft .NET library), and distribute linked combinations including the

</I>&gt;<i>of this program with the  DockPanel Suite (or with modified versions of
</I>&gt;<i>DockPanel Suite that use the same license as the  DockPanel Suite), and
</I>&gt;<i>distribute linked combinations including the two. You must obey the GNU
</I>&gt;<i>General Public License in all respects for all of the code used other than
</I>&gt;<i>the Microsoft .NET library and the DockPanel Suite.
</I>&gt;<i>If you modify this file, you may extend this exception to your version of the
</I>&gt;<i>file, but you are not obliged to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete
</I>&gt;<i>this exception statement from your version.

</I>&gt;<i>So its okay for #d to link against non-OSS and even proprietary closed-source

</I>&gt;<i>support an
</I>&gt;<i>accepted OSI licensing scheme for #d or monodevelop AddIns is asking too 
</I>&gt;<i>much...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>seems more like a case of 'do as we say, not as we do' than any real

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Out of curiosity, what exactly are you taking to the FSF, because it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; seems like in the last 2 days, a lot of different issues/concerns
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; regarding licensing have been touched upon.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Your decision regarding to only accepting future contributions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; licensed under X11. This in our understanding has a number of issues
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; affecting monodevelop in its entirety:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) As the existing files are under GPL, and you now only accept X11,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; those files can no longer in any way be modified. This would be a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very serious issue for the further development of MD unless of course
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you accept GPL'd contributions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) Add-ins that make use of the GPL'd interfaces, namespaces, methods
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; etc. have to be licensed under the GPL as well. See
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#TOCGPLAndPlugins">http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#TOCGPLAndPlugins</A>&gt; as quoted
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in a previous email by me. In effect, your decision would prevent the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; development of add-ins making use of any part of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; #develop/monodevelop add-in architecture.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) Add-ins that do not in any way use or depend on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; #develop/monodevelop infrastructure and which can be used in other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; programs are fine. I just cannot see how those would work (call me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unimaginative if you like).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As I am quite certain that this is not exactly your interpretation of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the issue at hand, we decided to ask the professionals.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
