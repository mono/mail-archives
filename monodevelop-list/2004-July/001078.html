Their view on the GPL is biased (as is mine), however the GPL is a legal
document, whose merits can only be ruled on by a judge, which the FSF is
not.

I will politely request that unless someone on this list is interested
in what the FSF has to say, if you could please post their
response/findings somewhere else, as I feel this list has seen enough of
this discussion. That said, I would personally love to read the FSF
response, so when you get it, please do forward it to my personal
mailbox.

Aye
