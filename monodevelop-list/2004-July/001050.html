</I>Your decision regarding to only accepting future contributions 
licensed under X11. This in our understanding has a number of issues 
affecting monodevelop in its entirety:

1) As the existing files are under GPL, and you now only accept X11, 
those files can no longer in any way be modified. This would be a 
very serious issue for the further development of MD unless of course 
you accept GPL'd contributions.

2) Add-ins that make use of the GPL'd interfaces, namespaces, methods 
etc. have to be licensed under the GPL as well. See 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#TOCGPLAndPlugins">http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#TOCGPLAndPlugins</A>&gt; as quoted 
in a previous email by me. In effect, your decision would prevent the 
development of add-ins making use of any part of the 
#develop/monodevelop add-in architecture.

3) Add-ins that do not in any way use or depend on the 
#develop/monodevelop infrastructure and which can be used in other 
programs are fine. I just cannot see how those would work (call me 
unimaginative if you like).

As I am quite certain that this is not exactly your interpretation of 
the issue at hand, we decided to ask the professionals.
Regards,
