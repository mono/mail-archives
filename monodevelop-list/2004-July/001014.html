I have the sinking feeling this is going nowhere - you cannot license 
something that links against GPL code under any other license but GPL. Only 
if it had no references to GPL-ed code in the first place (on submitting by 
contributor) and on acceptance you'd change it to link against the GPL'ed code.

Example 1: you have a MIT-licensed snippet of a search algorithm and tweak 
it so it is a search strategy (needs to implement a few interfaces etc) 
that works with #develop. Fine.

Example 2: someone writes a search strategy specifically for #develop which 
means it links against GPL'ed code in the first place. No way you can 
license that new search strategy MIT.
