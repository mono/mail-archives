<PRE>With respect to earlier e-mails that I sent regarding the fact that I could not run monodevelop (or mdtool) in any form - I have resolved some of the problems which were with my system.  However, when I run monodevelop, mdtool or monodoc - I get the following error message:


FATAL ERROR [2008-04-04 21:25:12Z]: System.DllNotFoundException: libglib-2.0-0.dll
  at (wrapper managed-to-native) GLib.Marshaller:g_malloc (uintptr)
  at GLib.Marshaller.StringToPtrGStrdup (System.String str) [0x00000] 
  at Gtk.Application.SetPrgname () [0x00000] 
  at Gtk.Application.Init () [0x00000] 
  at MonoDevelop.Core.Gui.Dialogs.SetupApp.Run (System.String[] arguments) [0x00000] 
  at MonoDevelop.Core.ApplicationService.StartApplication (System.String appId, System.String[] parameters) [0x00000] 


I found that in the .config files that the libglib-2.0-0.dll is mapped to libglib-2.0.so.0 and I have confirmed that this exists.  On my system it is a symbolic link to the following library - 
 
lrwxrwxrwx 2 root root 23 2008-04-04 20:22 libglib-2.0.so.0 -&gt; libglib-2.0.so.0.1600.2

I have also checked, via ldconfig -v, that the above is in the cache.  Can someone please help me with this as I have tried all of the things I could think of, and I feel that the above is all that is standing between my system being able to run monodevelop.

Thanks,

Brett Senior
