<PRE>I am still having a lot of problems in getting monodevelop to run.  I downloaded the latest version of mono source as well as the latest monodevelop source from svn.  The build went OK, but when I try to run things it fails and I am at a loss as to why.

For example, when I run:

    mdtool setup reg-build

I get the following output:

Another example is when I run 'mdtool gsetup' or try to run monodevelop or try to run an existing windows application I get the following output:


FATAL ERROR [2008-04-06 15:52:18Z]: System.DllNotFoundException: libglib-2.0-0.dll
  at (wrapper managed-to-native) GLib.Marshaller:g_malloc (uintptr)
  at GLib.Marshaller.StringToPtrGStrdup (System.String str) [0x00000] 
  at Gtk.Application.SetPrgname () [0x00000]

  at MonoDevelop.Core.ApplicationService.StartApplication (System.String appId, System.String[] parameters) [0x00000] 


Again, I do not have enough knowledge to track that one down.  So can someone please assist me in the above matters so that I can run monodevelop and then be able to re-develop my windows applications.

Thanks, 

Brett Senior
