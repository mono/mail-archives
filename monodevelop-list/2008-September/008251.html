MonoDevelop is derived from SharpDevelop, which was at the time GPL,
but as you may have noticed, Mono tends towards more liberal licences.
In fact, #D did relicense to LGPL in order to allow commercial/closed
addins, but they have so far refused to relicense our fork :-/

It will syntax highlight text when you tell it the mimetype of the
document. There are built-in highlighting schemes for C# and Boo
(among others), and APIs to add your own schemes.

Beyond that, things get more complicated. There's a simple property
somewhere for telling it to &quot;auto-indent&quot; (i.e. maintain the current
indentation level), but &quot;smart&quot; indentation requires a
language-specific indenter. We have ones for C# and C, but they're
elsewhere in MD. For folding, you need to feed the TextEditor a list
of fold regions so it knows where to fold -- likewise, we get this
from parsers elsewhere in MD. I can provide more info on where/how if
you need it, but if you're implementing this much, you might as well
just use all of MD :-)

The MonoDevelop.SourceEditor2 assembly is the only MD assembly that
depends on the TextEditor. It basically plugs it into MD's abstract
text editor interfaces, and completion &amp; smart indenters etc sit on
top of these interfaces.

Can you tell me what you're writing? It would help in understanding
the functionality you need.
