How did you install Mono 1.9? Please see
<A HREF="http://mjhutchinson.com/journal/2007/11/08/how_not_break_mono">http://mjhutchinson.com/journal/2007/11/08/how_not_break_mono</A>

&gt;<i> to get it to work well.  The IDE often crashes when closing a file

We can't do anything about these unless you give us stack traces.
Start MD from a terminal, and when it crashes you will see stack
traces (and if you run it with --debug, they will have line numbers,
which is more useful).

&gt;<i> Is there a basic list of what I need to install to get this thing to
</I>&gt;<i> work.  Do I need Mono 1.0 also?
</I>
No, MD works best with the newest releases on Mono and GTK#.
Ubuntu/Debian is known to have problems with MonoDevelop and GTK# --
it's believed that this is something to do with the
version/configuration of other libraries on these systems. No-one's
yet managed to track it down; the core MD developers uses SUSE
variants, and we have very few contributions from Ubuntu users. MD is
very stable on openSUSE and SLED.

BTW, putting &quot;Is this just a buggy difficult to install tool&quot; in your
message's subject isn't a good way to get a friendly response. I
almost didn't even both to read it.
