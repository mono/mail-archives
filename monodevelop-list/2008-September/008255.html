<PRE>Hi all,

In mid august I built Mono Develop svn from source so I could try out
the new debuger. All went fairly well there were some problems with
text editor not refreshing after side ways scrolling. Recently I tried
to do an svn update, configure then make and install. I also updated
mono to the latest svn build.

The problem is now I have monodevelop running again but all project
editing seems to be broken. I can right click on a folder and click
add files, the menu item is disabled. The project compiles fine, but
all project editing seems to be disabled. I tried checking out and
building an earlier version which still seems to have the same
problem.

The only real difference I can tell is I had to compile Mono Develop
without Boo integration (the project wasn't using that anyway). All of
the projects are MS Build based Visual Studio projects.

Is this a known problem or have I some how disabled project editing.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Charlie M
