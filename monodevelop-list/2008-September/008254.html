<PRE>&gt;<i> It will syntax highlight text when you tell it the mimetype of the
</I>&gt;<i> document. There are built-in highlighting schemes for C# and Boo
</I>&gt;<i> (among others), and APIs to add your own schemes.
</I>
Okay, I guessed I missed that when browsing the code. Is mimetype a
property of Document? (I don't have the code in front of me)

&gt;<i> Beyond that, things get more complicated. There's a simple property
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere for telling it to &quot;auto-indent&quot; (i.e. maintain the current
</I>&gt;<i> indentation level), but &quot;smart&quot; indentation requires a
</I>&gt;<i> language-specific indenter. We have ones for C# and C, but they're
</I>&gt;<i> elsewhere in MD.
</I>
Yeah, &quot;smart&quot; indentation is what I was thinking of.

&gt;<i> For folding, you need to feed the TextEditor a list
</I>&gt;<i> of fold regions so it knows where to fold -- likewise, we get this
</I>&gt;<i> from parsers elsewhere in MD. I can provide more info on where/how if
</I>&gt;<i> you need it, but if you're implementing this much, you might as well
</I>&gt;<i> just use all of MD :-)
</I>
That's one heck of an upstream dependency just to get a text editor :-)

&gt;<i> The MonoDevelop.SourceEditor2 assembly is the only MD assembly that
</I>&gt;<i> depends on the TextEditor. It basically plugs it into MD's abstract
</I>&gt;<i> text editor interfaces, and completion &amp; smart indenters etc sit on
</I>&gt;<i> top of these interfaces.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can you tell me what you're writing? It would help in understanding
</I>&gt;<i> the functionality you need.
</I>
I'd like to have an integrated text editor that will allow for
scripting extensibility in my application (mainly Boo, but ideally
Python or Ruby also). In Windows, I can use the ScintillaNET
(<A HREF="http://www.codeplex.com/ScintillaNET">http://www.codeplex.com/ScintillaNET</A>) bindings that give me an easy
to use editor with the following features:
 - syntax highlighting
 - code folding
 - code completion API

I was hoping to be able to use the MD component as it seems (correct
me if I'm wrong) that GtkSourceView lacks the last two. And, as far as
I know, there is no way to use Scintilla with Gtk# without writing my
own bindings.
