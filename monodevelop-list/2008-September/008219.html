Currently this is non-trivial, but possible. You will have to unload
the project from monodevelop, then find the widget's element in the
source project's gtk-gui/gui.stetic file (don't worry, it's XML, so
not too painful) and copy it and its contents to the target's
gtk-gui/gui.stetic file. When you re-open the project and try to open
the widget (from the &quot;user interface&quot; virtual folder) you will be
asked what class you would like to associate it with.

Hopefully we will be moving to a &quot;one widget per file&quot; model, with
each widget in a visible file, with the associated code files groupeds
as its children. You will then be able to copy the whole group between
projects:

This will bring the development model more in line with that of
ASP.NET, XAML and Winforms.
