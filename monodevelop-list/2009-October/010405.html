<PRE>Hi all,
Further to my problem detailed below, I have managed to build a simple
VB2005 program. This will now run in the MonoDevelop environment OK. 
When I try to create a Tarball to deploy to a Linux m/c I get the following
in the 'Packaging Output' window:

Creating packages
Package: Tarball

Generating Autotools files for Solution DrawGraphics
Creating Makefile.am for Solution DrawGraphics
Creating autogen.sh
Creating configure.ac
Creating Makefile.include
Adding variables to top-level Makefile
Deploying Solution to Tarball
Autotools files were successfully generated.
Solution could not be deployed: . The system cannot find the file specified

I can't find any of the files that are listed like Makefile.am, autogen.sh
etc and do not know which file is being referred to in the statement:  The
system cannot find the file specified.

Can anybody offer advice on this problem?

Regards

Brian Smart



Hello Michael,
I have installed the resgen tool so that part is OK.

I have a suspicion I am either over complicating the problem of converting
programs from a Windows VB 2005 created program for use on a Linux system or
perhaps more likely, trying to do the impossible.

I understand that at the current state of development MonoDevelop may not be
able to handle all functions available using VB 2005 and that the MoMA
program may be able to identity these. Could you confirm that this statement
is true?

To explain my desire more completely:
I can develop programs to run on a Windows machine using VB 2005 to carry
out automated operations that I need. What I want to do is convert the
programs so that I can create an install package that will enable the
program to run on a Linux system without using a program such as 'Wine'. The
programs as written provide access to emails and databases and both are
Windows programs (Outlook and Access).
Am I expecting the impossible?

If I install MonoDevelop on my Linux m/c will this make any difference to my
requirement?

If I install MonoDevelop on my Linux m/c and set about learning C# for
example can I then, by starting from scratch achieve my objective?

Sorry about all the questions but if you can help it will be great.

Regards

Brian Smart

It's used to compile resx resources. It should be included with mono
tools. What distro or OS are you running on?

&gt;<i> On a general note, am I right to assume that a program created with VB

You don't need to rebuild it. You can use the same binary. You should
scan it with MoMA to check that it's compatible with Mono:
