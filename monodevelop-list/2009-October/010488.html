I don't like to &quot;me too&quot; very much, but I feel I should here.  It's
very useful to be able to skim the list of errors, especially because
sometimes one error is actually only caused by another error.  Usually
I can do a better job of figuring out where the real problem is than
the IDE, and I would prefer to investigate the error list instead of
being thrown to the first error.

Personally, I just unpin the error list, and that works well enough
for me.  I would at least argue that even if there is another,
alternative workflow introduced, it should not remove the possibility
of MD behaving like it does right now.  I might consider using the
error bubbles, but usually by the time I double-click the build error
to fix it, I already know what the problem is and don't need to see
the error again inline.
