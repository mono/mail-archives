<PRE>Dear Translators and Committers,

MonoDevelop is now string-frozen for release. No changes should be made
to the translatable strings without careful review and extremely good
reasons. This freeze applies to trunk until 2.2 is branched, and will
apply to the 2.2 branch indefinitely.

This means its time to start translating MonoDevelop for the 2.2
release!

Procedure is the same as before, but I'll run through it for newcomers.
before beginning a translation, please reply to the list with your
intentions, so we don't have duplicated efforts.

I've committed up-to-date version of all the .po files to MonoDevelop
main in SVN. Either use an up-to-date SVN checkout, or grab the
appropriate .po file from
<A HREF="http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/viewvc/trunk/monodevelop/main/po.">http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/viewvc/trunk/monodevelop/main/po.</A>

      * To edit the .po file, you can open the MonoDevelop solution in
        MonoDevelop, find the &quot;po&quot; project, and edit the translation
        using our editor. Alternatively you can use any po editor or
        text editor to edit the po file.
      * To add a new translation from within MonoDevelop, use the
        context menu on the &quot;po&quot; project. If you are doing this
        manually, make a copy of messages.po, rename it to match your
        language code, and add it to the lists in the Makefile.am and
        the po.mdproj file.
      * To test the translation, build MonoDevelop (using either
        MonoDevelop itself or &quot;make&quot;), ensure that you have set the
        appropriate LANGUAGE/LANG environment variable, and run
        MonoDevelop using the Run button or &quot;make run&quot;.

Several of the addins in extras/ have been set up with po files.

When you are done, please commit your translation if you have SVN
commit access, or email your translation to this mailing list.

Thank you for you contributions!

</PRE>
