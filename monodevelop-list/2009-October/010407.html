<PRE>Hi,

 
&gt;<i> Hello Michael,
</I>&gt;<i> I have installed the resgen tool so that part is OK.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have a suspicion I am either over complicating the problem of
</I>&gt;<i> converting programs from a Windows VB 2005 created program for use on a
</I>Linux
&gt;<i> system or perhaps more likely, trying to do the impossible.
</I>
As Michael mentioned you don't need to convert anything, just copy the
binary from your Windows machine to your Linux system and run it. 

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I understand that at the current state of development MonoDevelop may
</I>&gt;<i> not be able to handle all functions available using VB 2005 and that the
</I>MoMA
&gt;<i> program may be able to identity these. Could you confirm that this
</I>&gt;<i> statement is true?
</I>
VB 2005 is fully supported (note that you may still use Windows-specific
features, such as P/Invokes, which probably won't work right away, this is
when MoMA can help you, it will analyze your program and tell you which
problems you may have - note that the issues MoMA finds aren't VB-specific,
if you'd written the same program in C# you'd have the same potential
problems).

Note that there are many ways Visual Studio will help you when writing code
which isn't implemented in MonoDevelop (such as intellisense for instance).

&gt;<i> To explain my desire more completely:
</I>&gt;<i> I can develop programs to run on a Windows machine using VB 2005 to
</I>&gt;<i> carry out automated operations that I need. What I want to do is convert
</I>the
&gt;<i> programs so that I can create an install package that will enable the
</I>&gt;<i> program to run on a Linux system without using a program such as
</I>&gt;<i> 'Wine'. 
</I>
As I mentioned above in principle you don't need to convert anything (it
really depends on exactly what your program does).

&gt;<i> The programs as written provide access to emails and databases and both
</I>are
&gt;<i> Windows programs (Outlook and Access).
</I>&gt;<i> Am I expecting the impossible?
</I>
I don't think I follow you here, Outlook and Access are both Windows
programs and those won't run on linux (assuming you don't want to use Wine).


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If I install MonoDevelop on my Linux m/c will this make any difference
</I>&gt;<i> to my requirement?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If I install MonoDevelop on my Linux m/c and set about learning C# for
</I>&gt;<i> example can I then, by starting from scratch achieve my objective?
</I>
You can do the exact same things with both VB and C#, so it does not make a
difference.
 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry about all the questions but if you can help it will be great.
</I>
First I'd recommend running MoMA on your program to identify possible
issues, and it would also be easier to help if you explained more detailed
what your program does.

Rolf
