<PRE>On behalf of the Trustees and Executor of the estate of Late Engr. Luther 
Kruger, I once again try to notify you as my earlier letter returned 
undelivered. I hereby attempt to reach you again by this same email address on 
the WILL.

I wish to notify you that Late Engr. Luther Kruger made you a beneficiary to his 
WILL.He left the sum of Twenty two million five hundred thousand United States 
Dollars ($22,500.000.00USD)to you in the codicil and last testament to his WILL.

This may sound strange and unbelievable to you, but it is real and true. Being a 
widely travelled man, he must have been in contact with you in the past or
simply you were recommended to him by one of his numerous friends abroad who 
wished you good.

Late Engr. Luther Kruger died on the 12th day of March,2007,at the age of 80 
years, and his WILL is now ready for execution. According to him this money is 
to support your humanitarian activities and to help the poor and the needy in 
our society.

Please if I reach you this time as I am hopeful, endeavor to get back to me as 
soon as possible to enable me conclude my job.

I hope to hear from you in no distant time through the email address below.

Yours in Service,
Keith Weatherly(Mrs)
Secretary To-
Thomas Watson QC.
</PRE>
