<PRE>Hello,

Finding/tuning a good behaviour is not necessarily &quot;simple&quot;.
&gt;<i>
</I>
It is simple;   We try it, and if we do not like it, we change it.

Until we see the prototype, all of this discussion of potential problems is
merely academic.   I love an academic discussion as much as the next guy,
but it is not worth wasting our time discussing academic issues.

Well, *I* like to be able to skim the list of errors first to get an
&gt;<i> idea of what was broken. Things can be more complicated, for example,
</I>&gt;<i> when autogenerated code is involved, and you sometimes need to get the
</I>&gt;<i> big picture to see what's happened.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The only time when the pad will be shown is when you explicitly click on the
error/warning message on the status bar.    There is your solution.

&gt;&gt;<i> * How should bubble rendering interact with breakpoint markers or the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; current line highlight marker?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Side by side.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That doesn't work. Breakpoints are rendered across the full line, not
</I>&gt;<i> just in the margin.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I fail to see why this is a problem.    The bubble is overlayed, it is not
one-or-the-other.


&gt;&gt;<i> * Does the purpose of bubbles conflict with the squiggly underlines
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; for on-the-fly syntax errors? Should we still use squiggly underlines
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; for all on-the-fly errors (e.g. spelling, syntax, etc) and save
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; bubbles for compile-time errors?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes to which question? The latter?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes

&gt;<i> That is a good idea while we kill it
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You have yet to explain why we should &quot;kill&quot; it. Xcode still has one
</I>&gt;<i> for a reason.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Kill it by it will not be visible unless you click on it;   It will
effectively only be used for diagnostic purposes as I said before.
 If we get this right, we will make users happier. If we are too


&gt;<i> disruptive without considering the consequences, we will lose users.
</I>&gt;<i> Don't forget that users come from different perspectives, and emacs
</I>&gt;<i> and Xcode users like yourself are a tiny minority compared to those
</I>&gt;<i> who are familiar with other IDEs, especially VS. Blithely dismissing
</I>&gt;<i> these other viewpoints is incredibly counterproductive. We should be
</I>&gt;<i> discussing how we can make it more usable for everyone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Blithely questioning this new Fatwa for what is today a completely useless
and annoying behavior is incredible counterproductive.

We can fine tune the decision, but that is all we are going to do:fine tune
it;   There is a reason it is a fatwa and not a call-for-comments.

Miguel
