<PRE>I am new to Monodevelop and think it is a very cool product.
I am developing a medical instrument using Monodevelop on Linux(Ubuntu
9.04).
 
This is is window development strategy question....
I have a common main window with a keypad and other controls that are
COMMON
with several other screens I need to develop.  I would like to
programmatically insert a window in a window that
reflects only the changes RATHER than create copies of all the controls
on several other windows.
This would greatly decrease my maintenance on the screens. 
 
Does anyone have a suggestion on doing this?
 
......
My idea would be to create my own custom widgets that contain the
changes and then overwrite
and insert the custom widgets in the main window as needed. {Of course I
don't know how to do this yet...}
.... 
 
Secondly ---- Where is the best place to get the real details on
Monodevelop? So far I have seen  mostly
beginner help.  For example - I would love to see an example on setting
up translations. I have been learning by
trial and error - which is slow.
 
 
I appreciate the help and your time,
 
Regards,
david
