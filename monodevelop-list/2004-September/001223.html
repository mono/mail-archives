Well, .NET works that way. If you want to use the one .cs file you can
either compile it to a dll and reference that, or you can import it into
each project. Note, you will end up with 2 copies of the same file that
you will have to keep in sync.

If your question is why can't monodevelop reference the same file in 2
solutions without requiring it to be a copy, thats different. But as far
as the referencing a single .cs file, thats just now how .net works.
