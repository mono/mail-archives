I have just been revisiting this, and it seems overkill.  

Lets say I have a database, and I am building several executables that
access this database.  In my solution I make a project for the first
app, and create classes that access the database.  

I then create a second project in the solution that also needs to work
with the database, why cant I just do: using Database; and add a
reference to the Databse.cs file from the first project?

Why do I also need to add a reference the the .exe from the first
project, wont this require more over head when run?  

I guess I am missing some thing...

&lt;PRE&gt;&lt;FONT COLOR=&quot;#737373&quot;&gt;&lt;I&gt;Hi,

What you want to do is a Solution. A Solution can contain none to many 
projects. Each project will compile to an Assembly, either .exe or .dll.
In your case, you'll create one solution and add 3 executable projects to 
it. Them you code wich one and compile each one. When you start to require 
to use functions from another executable you add a Reference to the other 
executable, and then you can call its namespace/classes.

Just be careful with circular references, you can't add a reference to a 
executable/assembly that also references those project as well.

Hope it helps.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/PRE&gt;
