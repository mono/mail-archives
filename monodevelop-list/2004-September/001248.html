</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Of course, we could still use the traditional DispatchService methods,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; but I think that those &quot;artifacts&quot; would be enough for most of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; situations.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes. That sounds perfect.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We had begun to implement some stuff similar to that (Where public API
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was considered to be safe regardless of where it was called from), but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; didn't get anywhere near completion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One thing to keep in mind, is some code will potentially have to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; restructured.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When you dispatch something to the gui thread, you get execution back
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; right away, potentially before the code has done what you needed it to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My idea is to add a synchronized dispatch, so the dispatch call won't
</I>&gt;<i> return until the method has finished its execution in the gui thread.
</I>&gt;<i> This isn't the most optimal solution for some cases, but it provides a
</I>&gt;<i> safe starting point. We can later optimize by reestructuring the code
</I>&gt;<i> and using asynchronous calls if needed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>

Excellent

&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Case in point:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When you double click on a method node in the class browser, it was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; calling OpenFile. OpenFile was changed to internally use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DispatchService. However, the rest of the code in the event handler
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inside the class browser continued to run, and it attempted to operate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on the 'newly' opened window, that wasn't actually open. These sorts of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; changes have to be watched for. Also, we are opening ourselves up to a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very difficult to debug situation. While I agree that this is absolutely
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the right direction, debugging this new code will be far more difficult,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as you wont get a stack trace beyond the most recent gui thread
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transition.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For synchronous calls this won't be such a problem because we can send
</I>&gt;<i> the exception back to the caller thread and get information from the
</I>&gt;<i> caller stack there. For asynchronous calls, we can do some tricks. For
</I>&gt;<i> example, we could capture the stack trace of the caller and show it if
</I>&gt;<i> the method call fails (this behavior would be enabled with a special
</I>&gt;<i> debug flag).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
That sounds perfect. I just wanted to make sure we aren't deep down this
path before we realize debugging is next to impossible (evolution).
