My idea is to add a synchronized dispatch, so the dispatch call won't
return until the method has finished its execution in the gui thread.
This isn't the most optimal solution for some cases, but it provides a
safe starting point. We can later optimize by reestructuring the code
and using asynchronous calls if needed.

</I>&gt;<i> on the 'newly' opened window, that wasn't actually open. These sorts of

</I>&gt;<i> as you wont get a stack trace beyond the most recent gui thread

</I>
For synchronous calls this won't be such a problem because we can send
the exception back to the caller thread and get information from the
caller stack there. For asynchronous calls, we can do some tricks. For
example, we could capture the stack trace of the caller and show it if
the method call fails (this behavior would be enabled with a special
debug flag).
