Its called red-carpet

Again, use red-carpet to install software. People who are 'seasoned
intelligent computer users' seem to think that they can do everything.
Hey, I know how to drive my car, but you won't see me working under the
hood. And by the same token, I sure as hell won't get in the car my
mechanic is driving.

</I>&gt;<i> installers for them.

It doesnt work on windows, and works poorly on osx.
