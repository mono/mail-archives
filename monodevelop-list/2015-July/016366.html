<PRE>I would suspect that 'Stock Icons' aren't just as simple as loading in a PNG
file; and that's the problem.

If you look at this page, where GitHub was asking for people to create Icons
for them... the results are a particular format, generally format .svg and
sometimes .png and they contain many different sizes in one file... at the
very least: 16x16, 22x22, 32x32, and 48x48.

They said they must conform to:
<A HREF="http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Theme_Guidelines">http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Theme_Guidelines</A>

They had said at that time... &quot;You can use Inkscape, a Free SVG
application.&quot;

Thus, I suspect that, when we are trying to just load in a PNG file (because
there is no documentation for the interface) we then get disappointed that
it didn't 'work', when it isn't just asking for a simple PNG file... it's
asking for a file that has been prepared in a particular way - and that is
why it breaks.

Thus, most likely the Designer is working just fine - depending upon what
'fine' means.

I believe the files are then sent to Icon Factory... So, researching what
Icon Factory needs is probably also the key to getting Stock Icons of our
own making to work properly with buttons.

<A HREF="http://uic.sourceforge.net/api/12/uic/model/IconFactory.IconRepository.html">http://uic.sourceforge.net/api/12/uic/model/IconFactory.IconRepository.html</A>

...

One thing I have learned, so far, though is... you need to load them in from
your Project (right-clicking the second word under Solution, doing a
Right-click Add-&gt;Add Files and then going down to Properties area where the
image will be and choosing 'Build Action-&gt;Embedded Resource'.

I suspect that, if this file was then a properly set-up svg icon file with
it's many different sizes inside... it could then be loaded into a button
from the 'Resources' area.

That is what I'm guessing at the current moment. Time will tell whether it
works or not. I will search for that inkscape program they were talking
about. I suspect that it might automatically create the different sizes
necessary (but might have to do it myself... not sure yet).

Keep you posted...
