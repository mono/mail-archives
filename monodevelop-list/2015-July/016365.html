<PRE>Well, the thing that is irritating is - I'm sure if the guy who designed the
Designer documented the way it was supposed to work; it would be easy.

You don't release something unless it is working... so it has to mean that
it works; but the secret lies in the fact that it only works when a png is a
particular size - and/or dpi.

I haven't yet tried formats other than png, either. Does anybody know what
the inherent underlying picture format of Linux is (for example: PICT format
for old Macs, BMP for Windows, etc).

The weird thing is... it creates an icon for the icon; so it has to be
reading it. I tried looking for the built-in Stock Images; but can't find
them anywhere. Figured if I loaded one in, I could look at it and see what
size and dpi it was; but I can't find them. They're probably embedded in
some monodevelop system file somewhere.

The thing is... monodevelop shouldn't just be something to help us. It
should be a thing which can be completely used to develop applications
(programs) without us having to resort to doing strange things outside their
interface.

Basic4Android on the PC is much like monodevelop - and all such things are
built-in to the interface. You don't have to suddenly go outside the GUI and
do things to make it work properly. The whole idea of a GUI is that it works
through the GUI. That you don't have to remember a million different
function names or how to implement them.

A computer is supposed to make things easier for mankind... not have us be
burdened by a million things to remember. After all, a computer remembers
better than any other thing it does. It has gigabytes of memory that it can
use to remember in. Then, we are set free from having to remember tons of
things we don't really need to remember and get along with the process of
creating programs where it's fun to program instead of arduous.
