<PRE>I just came across a strange sentence on a website, &quot;Note that the icon will
probably only show up on Windows, Linux uses a different way to display
icons for executable files.&quot;

Could this be why no Stock Icon that I make myself shows, that it always
just shows the Icon name? because I'm using Linux?

They were referring to when you use an ICO file, I believe, however and I've
tried PNG and SVG as well.

I assume that everybody else just gave up using the Stetic Design interface?
I don't give up easily.

I've also had problems where Stetic Designer just dies instantly and the
interface just goes 'pop' and is gone with no error.

I've thought that it was because I updated to the newest version and
downgraded back to 3.x.x.x; but that seems like overkill.

I've also tried not installing:

sudo apt-get install monodevelop-nunit 
sudo apt-get install monodevelop-versioncontrol
sudo apt-get install monodevelop-database

the database gives errors when you try and install it. I suspect that the
versioncontrol part was what was creating the crashes, but can't prove it.

I also tried:

sudo apt-get install -y mono-complete fsharp nugget referenceassemblies-pcl

...

The problem with the internet is... it sometimes gives you information that
you no longer have to do because it was fixed a long time ago.

Certainly just doing the regulation:

sudo apt-get install mono-complete
sudo apt-get install monodevelop
sudo apt-get install xterm

Gets you to a very old version of mono and monodevelop

However, I still can't get it to load my own Stock Icons even with that old
version. Does exactly the same thing.

Is there some other manner of installing mono/mono-develop that anybody has
used which creates a more usable new version of monodevelop (5.9.4) for the
Raspberry PI?

And, we are all sorely needing a manual so we can understand how to use
Stetic. I think everybody tries it, fails, then just goes on to write their
own code without using Stetic. If they made a manual, even if it was a
simple rudimentary one, it certainly would help (particularly where it
concerns making your own stock icons and using them. 

For example, does 'Multiple Images' mean that when you click on a  button,
the first image shows before you click it and the second image shows after
you've clicked it? Or, is it a way to create an animation? Putting
individual photos as frames one-by-one and then getting them to show in some
fashion (that isn't documented).

Even using the Image Widget would be incredibly powerful. I can, at least,
get an image to display (at the size you made it); but adding events to the
image doesn't automatically add routines to the code at all for those
events.

Has anybody ever succeeded in using Stetic in an image manner (not just
using their stock icons, and getting images to size themselves to the size
of the HBox that they're in).

Is there a way to limit the size of the HBox in Stetic? Maybe that's what's
needed. I'll look into doing that next.
