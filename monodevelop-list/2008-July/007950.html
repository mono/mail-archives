<PRE>Hello,

I posted a question a few days ago about building MonoDevelop. I
noticed someone else had a similar question after mine and I thought I
would post what I did to get it to work. I think I've fully described
the process here, forgive me if I missed something. It took me about a
day to get it worked out lol. I find any errors I'll post a
correction.

First, sorry about the long post.

Second, I had to remove the Mono installation I had on my system.
There was nothing wrong with it but I found that I had to use the one
from MacPorts to get all this work. I can provide instructions about
removing the Mono installation provided by the Mono project site if
anyone needs help with this.

Next, install MacPorts if you haven't already. I also removed all of
my Fink stuff, and I wasn't not able to get this to work using Fink

Install the following packages from MacPorts:

  mono
  mono-addins
  gnome-sharp2

Add this to you bash environment:

  export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib

You need to add a couple sym-links in the MacDevelop GTK Sharp area to
get pkg-config to work. Got this directory
/opt/local/var/macports/software/gtk-sharp2/2.10.3_0/opt/local/lib/pkgconfig.
Add these links:

  # These correct a naming conflict between the MacPorts gtk-sharp2
project name and the pkg-config files
  sudo ln -s gtk-sharp-2.0.pc gtk-sharp2.pc
  sudo ln -s glade-sharp2-2.0.pc glade-sharp2.pc

Get the latest MonoDevelop source like this:

  svn co <A HREF="svn://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/trunk/monodevelop">svn://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/trunk/monodevelop</A>

Alter the first several lines of the 'configure' script to look
'exactly' like this (very important!):

   #!/bin/bash
   VERSION=0.17
   profile=mac

    prefix=`pkg-config --variable=prefix mono`

Then run this:

   sudo ./configure  # I found it important to be running as root
   make
   make run

If you get any complaints about TypeInitializationException when you
run MonoDevelop let me know. I had a bunch of problems related to
libgtk-x11-2.0.0.dylib. I solved these a couple of different ways and
I think the steps I documented handle it.

There may be a simpler way to this, I don't know, but hopefully this helps :)

I also may have forgotten to document a step, so if you're having
trouble let me know and I'll see if I can help. I'm going do nice
write up on this early next week and post it on my web site. I also
intend to test this build process again on a couple of more macs
before I do. I hoping to do a lot of work with MonoDevelop, and
hopefully I can contribute some stuff back. I might try to package up
a working version of MonoDevelop for people running on the Mac next
week if I can find someplace to put it on the web.

Can someone tell me how to replay to a thread on using this news
groups mail manager program too? I tried to Google and answer but I
could find it.

Enjoy!

   -Jeff
