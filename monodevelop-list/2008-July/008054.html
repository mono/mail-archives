<PRE>I have just upgraded to MD 2.0 Alpha 1 - and right from the start I am having *major* problems in that I *cannot* open any existing project names due to the fact that one of my directories in the path has a '#' in it.  This used to work fine in MD 1.0 and I am amazed that such a problem now is shown in the latest version.  I could not find any configuration item in Edit/Preferences that allows me to change this odd behaviour.  I realise that I can change the name of my directory - but will that affect the projects that I have - in terms of the project knowing where files are located ?  The error that comes up has %23 in the filename rather than the # - and I gather that this is the hex representation of it - and the file name is the one that you get programatically when you drag and drop files on a widget.

 
Please help !

Brett Senior.
