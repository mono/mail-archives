What don't you just expose the particular widgets that you need as properties?

public Entry NameEntry { get { return nameEntry; } }

or better, just expose the *functionality* that you need, without
exposing the details of the window:

public string UserName { get { return nameEntry.Text; } set {
nameEntry.Text = value; }}

&gt;<i> convert this application and unfortunately that means I will have to

</I>
It's hard to be certain without looking at the particular use case,
but it sounds to me like an design/encapsulation problem. It's
generally considered a bad idea to expose fields directly -- which is
why we have properties. A lot nicer than java/c++ getters and setters
:<i>)
</I>
I'm not sure, but I think that just declaring the fields yourself
(with different accessibility) may work.

If there's still a compelling case for changing the accessibility of
fields, please file an enhancement request on bugzilla.
