<PRE>When using MD 1.0 today - I had a major problem in that after a re-compile, *all* events associated with menus and buttons were lost and looking at the gui.stetic file, I found that although all of the widget layout details were still there, *all* event related code went missing !  Luckily I had a backup of the file and could restore it and then re-make the changes to the gui side of the application.
Is this a known problem in MD 1.0 (its not the first time it has happened to me, but this time was the most catastrophic of the events) ?  If not, then will it be fixed in your latest release (still waiting for it to appear in the Debian repository) ?  If no to either of these questions, could you provide me with a link so that I can log a bug report ?

 
Thanks,

Brett Senior
