MonoDevelop parses the pages itself and resolves control types in
order to generate the CodeBehind fields, as the standard ASP.NET APIs
don't really expose anything for doing this sort of thing. There are a
few things that /look/ almost appropriate, but in practice don't work
well in an IDE, for example they need to reflect into the referenced
assemblies.

To resolve control types, MD tries to resolve the tag registrations
the same way the ASP.NET would. Unfortunately MD 1.0's handling of
third-party controls is a little flaky, as I had very few examples
with which to test it. MD 2.0 should hopefully be somewhat improved in
this regard.
