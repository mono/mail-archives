</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's clearly still in development, but what are the plans and timeline?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The plan is to release it with MonoDevelop 2.0 around the end of the
</I>&gt;<i> year. Several alpha and beta releases will be available in the following
</I>&gt;<i> months.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Some of the views that exist now are pretty neat, but what about things
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like, say, visually inspecting variables while debugging, 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can already do that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Yeah, I did notice that after sending that mail. I was expecting
something more direct than a tooltip.

&gt;<i> &gt; or other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; features otherwise hidden in the GUI version? Is there some kind of TODO
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; list, or some obvious things that need to be implemented? I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specifically interested in things that I could pick up and start working
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on, fwiw.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The debugger integration is being done by me and by Alfonso Santos (GSOC
</I>&gt;<i> student). Right now, no additional help is needed in this area.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Uh, OK.

&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Adding breakpoints to files in assemblies other than the main assembly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't work, e.g., if a solution contains a support library foo.dll for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bar.exe, and I try adding a breakpoint to a file in foo.dll, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; debugger can't resolve that file, apparently because foo.dll isn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; loaded at that point.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's not supported yet, but planned.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
For 2.0? It seems fundamental.

&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Starting up a program under the debugger takes a fairly long time, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there's no feedback that things are happening during this process.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How much is &quot;fairly long time&quot;? It takes like 2 seconds here. This is
</I>&gt;<i> normal, although it can be improved.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Nearly 30 seconds.

&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What key is &quot;L1&quot;? It's bound to the step commands, but I have no idea
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what key that corresponds to.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> F11, Michael explained the problem with it. We have to fix that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Lluis.
