&gt;<i> Hi.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm looking to implement a VersionControl Add-in for MonoDevelop that
</I>&gt;<i> uses Perforce as the back-end, and had a few questions about VC and
</I>&gt;<i> Add-in development:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   - First, has someone already written such a thing? (I'm assuming not,
</I>&gt;<i> given Google's silence).
</I>
Nope. the only (successful/released) version control addin that I know
of is the SVN one in trunk.

&gt;<i>   - It doesn't look like there's any way for MonoDevelop to figure out
</I>&gt;<i> that a particular solution/project/file/etc. is already under version
</I>&gt;<i> control -- I only see hooks to &quot;checkout&quot; and &quot;publish&quot; code. If this
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't exist, that would obviously be a neat feature.
</I>
It does do that. The real fun is all in the Repository instances that
the VersionControlSystem returns, which has (among many other things)
an IsVersioned (string localPath) method.

Take a look at <A HREF="http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/viewcvs/trunk/monodevelop/main/src/addins/VersionControl/MonoDevelop.VersionControl/MonoDevelop.VersionControl/Repository.cs?view=markup">http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/viewcvs/trunk/monodevelop/main/src/addins/VersionControl/MonoDevelop.VersionControl/MonoDevelop.VersionControl/Repository.cs?view=markup</A>
and the SVN implementation:
<A HREF="http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/viewcvs/trunk/monodevelop/main/src/addins/VersionControl/MonoDevelop.VersionControl.Subversion/MonoDevelop.VersionControl.Subversion/SubversionRepository.cs?view=markup">http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/viewcvs/trunk/monodevelop/main/src/addins/VersionControl/MonoDevelop.VersionControl.Subversion/MonoDevelop.VersionControl.Subversion/SubversionRepository.cs?view=markup</A>

&gt;<i>   - Related to that, how does the VC add-in know that a solution is
</I>&gt;<i> under version control?
</I>
By asking the version control addins if the project file is under
version control GetRepositoryReference in VersionControlService, and
using the first one that returns a non-null Repository.

&gt;<i>   - I'd like to add a simple preference pane, which lets you globally
</I>&gt;<i> enable the Add-in. I presume this is easy to do, I just haven't looked
</I>&gt;<i> hard enough yet at how to do it.
</I>
Yes, that's pretty easy, but why can't it just be enabled with the
addin manager?

&gt;<i>   - Does RequestWritePermission do what I hope it does? As in, if a file
</I>&gt;<i> needs to be written by MonoDevelop, will this be called if the file is
</I>&gt;<i> not writable? This is clearly desirable, here, since Perforce leaves
</I>&gt;<i> un-checked-out files read-only. I don't see any other command in
</I>&gt;<i> Repository that ties to a &quot;check out this file for editing.&quot; (which, of
</I>&gt;<i> course, VC systems that are better than Perforce don't usually have, but
</I>&gt;<i> I'm working with what I'm stuck with)
</I>
That's a good question. The Repository does have Lock/Unlock methods,
but I ahve no idea if they are actually used. I'm pretty sure that a
lot of code in MD wouldn't respect this.

That said, any patches needed to make it work properly would be welcome :)

[I can't actually find RequestWritePermission]

&gt;<i>   - Is there a simple way to get a &quot;console,&quot; or some way to print out
</I>&gt;<i> what p4 commands are being run? I think the IProgressMonitor plugs into
</I>&gt;<i> one, but I don't get passed one with every command -- I'm implementing
</I>&gt;<i> this by just using the `p4' command-line program, and I'd like to have
</I>&gt;<i> this for debugging and monitoring.
</I>
Well, there's MonoDevelop.LoggingService.LogDebug (which can be
enabled using environemnt variables and directed to the console, a
file, and/or the internal message pad)
System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine might be more approprate since
references to it get ignored if you compile without /d:DEBUG.

Also, if you can P/Invoke into some stable library, that'll be a *lot*
faster than constantly forking command-line processes. Dunno if
perforce supports this or not.

&gt;<i> Also, if the community is interested in this add-in, we might be able to
</I>&gt;<i> release it as open source.
</I>
That's be nice. We'd certainly appreciate validation that the APIs
work with something other than SVN :)
