<PRE>Hi all.

I've been investigating if Monodevelop's Docking library works as
expected in Windows environments.

I built the library against Gtk# 2.10 and it worked correctly using
the latest mono distribution for windows. I had some problems running
it directly from .NET and the Gtk# 2.10 installer that I solved using
some files from the Mono distribution, putting them in the same folder
of my application. These files are the MonoPosixHelper.dll and
MonoPosix.dll, in case some of you want to use the library directly in
.NET (I think this is due to the use of Gettext).

In the last couple of days I've been trying to &quot;integrate&quot; the look of
the docking widgets, but I failed doing so (Wimp theme seems to not
respect some Style.PaintXXX methods correctly).

So I'm planning to take two paths to accomplish this task:

a) Modify how Monodevelop.Dock arrange widgets for docking: this can be harder.
b) Draw our custom widgets specially for MonoDevelop (ala Eclipse does
for the docking pads): this seems easier.

What do you think is the best path to follow?

I'm asking this in order to start hacking on the library and
(eventually) get the changes applied to trunk if possible.

Thanks.
David.

PD: Is the Monodevelop Devel list working?? I subscribed but I do not
receive mail... :/
