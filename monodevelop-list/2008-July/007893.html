<PRE>Dear All,

    Further to the e-mail I sent a couple of weeks ago regarding the need to be able to access widget names &amp; actions in the Main Window class from another class.  As I mentioned I do it in VS using a 'pointer' to the window and then access the fields that I want that way.  I've looked deeper into my application and unless I programatically add *all* controls to the window (and thus be able to declare them as something other than private) I cannot convert this application and unfortunately that means I will have to maintain Vista/VS.  Is it possible to add this requirement to a list of 'desired features' that could be looked into whenever a new release of MD occurs ?
    Note: I also tried changing the 'Build()' code but it seems that this is regenerated every time that a compile occurs and thus even though this would have been a maintenance issue - I cannot use this method either.  Also I feel that having to add all of the controls programatically (and there a a *lot* of them) defeats the purpose of a very good tool such as MD.
