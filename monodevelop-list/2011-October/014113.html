<PRE>Hi Derek,

I am also having problems with MonoDevelop after upgrading to Ubuntu 
11.10. I do not get &quot;no C# compiler for .Net 3.5&quot; but there are no Gtk# 
libraries built for .Net 3.5 anymore. I changed the runtime version to 
Mono/.Net 4.0 to get my projects to build.

I still have a problem with NUnit. As soon as I attempt to run tests, I 
get &quot;Internal Error. NullReferenceException at 
System.Runtime.Remoting.Proxies.RealProxy.PrivateInvoke(
System.Runtime.Remoting.Proxies.RealProxy rp, IMessage msg, 
System.Exception&amp; exc,
System.Object[]&amp; out_args) [0x0000] in &lt;filename unknown&gt;:0&quot;

I found that a number of packages have been removed and had to be 
installed after the upgrade, but I still have not found anything that 
will fix the NUnit problem.

Jim

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Problems after upgrading from Ubuntu 11.04 to 11.10
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 14th -17th October 2011
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Performance -- very very very slow -- everything was a dog
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; installed Gnome shell and changed themes to Adawaita -- better
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; installed Chrome as Firefox was repeatedly hanging
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; using the Gnome desktop (you need to RIGHT click on the cog in the 
</I>&gt;<i> Login box after starting the PC to select Gnome) and Chrome has made 
</I>&gt;<i> life bearable, but it was 'hell' for 3 days whilst I figured this out 
</I>&gt;<i> -- not much help on the net/forums etc
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Still broken -- myRSS (own C# news feed reader) not working - 
</I>&gt;<i> running from Terminal shows numerous error messages 'missing method 
</I>&gt;<i> System.Type' and in MonoDevelop it seems that all the target 
</I>&gt;<i> assemblies are now wrong!!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Still broken -- MonoDevelop -- attempt to build fails with 'no C# 
</I>&gt;<i> compiler for .NET/3.5' !! this is the pits...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Still broken -- network printing -- other (Windows) PCs on the home 
</I>&gt;<i> network cannot print
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Fixed -- LibreOffice Calc -- this would just crash on start-up, 
</I>&gt;<i> after the start-up splash -- no error message -- Writer worked, as did 
</I>&gt;<i> Draw (didn't try the others) -- running 'libreoffice --calc %U' from 
</I>&gt;<i> Terminal at least showed an error message -- tried without the %U 
</I>&gt;<i> parameter (which I assume is user, but could not confirm) also failed 
</I>&gt;<i> -- finally one error message started to make sense, something about 
</I>&gt;<i> 'another instance of LibreOffice is accessing your personal settings 
</I>&gt;<i> which are locked' and that 'it's not safe for simultaneous access to 
</I>&gt;<i> your settings -- do you want to continue, Yes or No' -- neither Yes or 
</I>&gt;<i> No would work -- around this time also found that Nautilus (from 
</I>&gt;<i> Places) would disappear on start-up, in the same way as Calc -- reboot 
</I>&gt;<i> sorted this problem, Nautilus worked -- checking Syslog saw that 
</I>&gt;<i> LibreOffice and Nautilus were SegFaulting -- rummaging around the file 
</I>&gt;<i> system (now that Nautilus worked) I came across a '.lock' file in 
</I>&gt;<i> /home/.libreoffice/3 -- this file showed the user as 'root' (not my 
</I>&gt;<i> normal user) -- renamed this file to '.lockOLD' and, miracle of 
</I>&gt;<i> miracles, Calc finally worked (and created another '.lock' file with 
</I>&gt;<i> my usual user name).
