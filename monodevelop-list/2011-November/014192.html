To me it seems you're talking about a mixture between the daily builds 
of Mono (which I'm not sure they're available anymore; and if not, maybe 
the Mono community is glad to receive help in this are about improving 
CI via buildbots contributed by people like you?) and the packages 
provided by distros. Not sure what gap it fills and not sure how is that 
better from people compiling the sources themselves fi they want to test 
something bleeding edge.


&gt;&gt;<i> If you want to help your distro getting early updates of Mono packages

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think many people would like to see something different from what
</I>&gt;<i> there was in the past. For years, if you went to go-mono the &quot;other&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Linux selection reminded you that Debian/Ubuntu had Mono 2.6. And that
</I>&gt;<i> was it. No options for other versions, and nothing available for other
</I>&gt;<i> distros in terms of packaging.
</I>
Again, please don't mix the concept of the software developer with the 
software packager. What is in go-mono is just a link to the efforts of 
the packagers. If at any point in time go-mono shows outdated 
information, it's time to contact the mono community to update it. But 
if you're complaining about the lack of versions supported for your 
$distro, you have to go help the community of the distro. This is how 
open source works. It doesn't happen only with Mono, it happens with any 
other software.

In particular, again if $distro==debian|ubuntu, I think there has always 
existed the &quot;badgerreports PPA&quot; or something like that, which had higher 
versions of Mono than 2.6. Maybe the thing to complain is actually the 
low visibility of this PPA for newbies or something?


&gt;&gt;<i> And when I said &quot;particularly&quot;, I meant: in particular in the case of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Debian/Ubuntu.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, perhaps Debian and Ubuntu are in better shape, now that they have
</I>&gt;<i> 2.10.5. But how long will it stay at that version?
</I>
The long the community keeps doing the effort. You're the community too 
if you're willing to help.

And in regards to other distros, in case you think you're in worse 
shape, again please contact the packager community of it. If you're 
talking about OpenSUSE, you have to talk with Nelson Marquez which has 
already done an OBS repository of MonoDevelop 2.8.1 and works pretty 
well for me (look for it in <A HREF="http://software.opensuse.org">http://software.opensuse.org</A>).

So please, start using the right channels:
- If debian/ubuntu concerns, go debian/ubuntu forums/mailinglists/IRC, 
not here.
- If opensuse concerns, go opensuse forums/mailinglists/IRC, not here.
- If outdated info in go-mono website, go mono forums/mailinglists/IRC, 
not here. (This is a list/forum specific to MonoDevelop).
- etc.

Cheers
