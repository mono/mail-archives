<PRE>I have started using monodevelop recently.  It seems to have
a very intuitive interface.  I built an ubuntu 10.11 machine to
run it on as that seemed the easiest way to load all the packages
from the net.
 
My goal is to port a few Visual Basic .net programs I inherited to
be able to run under Linux and maybe Mac also.
 
I copied a solution for a very small solution from the windows box and
opened it and tried a build.
 
The first build errored out with on the generated code:

&lt;Global.System.Diagnostics.DebuggerStepThroughAttribute()&gt; _
Protected Overrides Sub OnCreateMainForm()
Me.MainForm = Global.jstation.JStation_Frm
End Sub

The first It complained that Global.jstation.JStation_Frm was a type
and could not be used in an expression.  Changing it to 
 

&lt;Global.System.Diagnostics.DebuggerStepThroughAttribute()&gt; _
Protected Overrides Sub OnCreateMainForm()
Me.MainForm = New Global.jstation.JStation_Frm
End Sub

changed the error messages.


Warning VBNC99998: Support for /doc:&lt;file&gt; has not been implemented. No documentation file will be generated. (VBNC99998) (JSTATION)

Error warning message should have been shown: 'using narrowing operators' (warning message should have been shown) (JSTATION)

I don't care about the generation of the documentation file.
However, the Error about 'using narrowing operators' has left me puzzled.
I Googled the message and did not find anything satisfying, only a bug
report from some time ago.

I suspect I am missing something obvious, but am not sure what.
Any suggestions would be welcome.
