I can't think of anything offhand, it was just an idea that had been
thrown around (&quot;wouldn't it be awesome if searches were instant?&quot;).
Other ideas in the same area would be
* indexing all references to make &quot;find references&quot; instant - though
maybe thsi could be done in pidb files rather than lucene
* some kind of global search (project, files, panels, docs, commands)
like QT Creator and VS Productivity Tools

- lucene would totally make sense for this, especially as MonoDoc docs
already have NLucene indexes

I'd love to hear any more ideas you have for improving usability and
productivity!
