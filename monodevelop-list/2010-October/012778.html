That makes sense. I'm sure Mike Krueger could give some input on that
area. We do a get a lot of people asking for Resharper (also made by
JetBrains) features for MD.

&gt;&gt;<i> * some kind of global search (project, files, panels, docs, commands)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like QT Creator and VS Productivity Tools
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudio/archive/2010/08/03/quick-access-extension.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudio/archive/2010/08/03/quick-access-extension.aspx</A>)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Will need to take a look.
</I>
VS productivity tools and power tools addin have a bunch of neat
ideas. I particularly like the Solution Navigator pad.

&gt;&gt;<i> - lucene would totally make sense for this, especially as MonoDoc docs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already have NLucene indexes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'd love to hear any more ideas you have for improving usability and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> productivity!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The very basic ideas I have found very useful are:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Quick open (Ctrl-Shift-N in IDEA), where you start typing either the
</I>&gt;<i> capital letters or the full name of the file you wanna find, and it gives
</I>&gt;<i> you a live list of files to jump to.
</I>
We've had this for ages - &quot;Go to File&quot; (Alt-Shift-O) and &quot;Go to Type&quot;
(Control-Shift-T) - and in MD 2.4 we added &quot;Navigate To...&quot;
(control-,) which behaves like VS2010, i.e. essentially go to any
file/type/member :)

&gt;<i> 2) IDEA-style of the Find all references feature - as opposed to a flat list
</I>&gt;<i> similar to VS.NET/MD, it gives you a hierarchical list grouped by usage type
</I>&gt;<i> and source file
</I>
That would be nice.

&gt;<i> 3) Then I'd love to introduce the smart tags feature - MD lacks it and it's
</I>&gt;<i> a pain to manually include all the namespaces you need :), but that's a
</I>&gt;<i> longer term shot.
</I>
Yup, definitely. The hard problem's not the UI though so much as the
background analysis and suggestions engine. I started on some
background analysis stuff a few months ago -
<A HREF="http://twitter.com/mjhutchinson/status/19875030462">http://twitter.com/mjhutchinson/status/19875030462</A> - but I never got
around to integrating MD's type resolver and implementing more complex
analyses. Another related idea could be to attach quick fixes to
compiler errors.

&gt;<i> In case you need some testing from me, my setup is:
</I>&gt;<i> Ubuntu 10.04 on a 4GB 2-core HP ProBook 4710s
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop from the trunk (not sure how this is called in the Git terms, I
</I>&gt;<i> don't have previous Git experience so learning something new here as well :)
</I>
The main git branch is called &quot;master&quot;.
