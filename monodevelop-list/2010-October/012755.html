<PRE>Hello guys,

Since I am new here, let me do a quick intro. My name's Sergey, and I've
been following Mono and MonoDevelop since ever since it was first announced.
I am a huge fan of the .NET framework and have some experience with it, and
I've always wanted to contribute to Mono. And now after several years of
watching I finally have an opportunity to join and get some stuff done.

Going through the what's needed sections in the wiki, I've noticed that
there's a need to integrate Lucene as the full-text search engine. I do have
some previous experience with NLucene, and I thought I could contribute
here.

I've been also using IntelliJ IDEA quite extensively for the recent month,
so I think I have ideas on how to improve on the MonoDevelop's ease of use
and productivity. But that's a long shot, of course.

In the meantime, has there been any discussion on the Lucene integration?
Would appreciate any info from the old folks on that before I start writing
down my own ideas on how to do this.

Best,
Sergey
