We don't have any stats on MD usage, but I'm pretty sure it's at least
in the thousands. However, don't forget that many project types -
ASP.NET, MonoTouch, Silverlight, MonoMac, etc - don't require
packaging. For some apps, zips of binaries are often fine, and for
open-source projects the &quot;done thing&quot; is to release tarballs and have
the distros do their own packaging.

&gt;<i> From looking at the various 'packaging' options out there (almost all seem

</I>
It's a nice thought but it would be very hard to implement properly.
How far down the deps chain do you want to go - glibc and X? Support
for building RPMs and DEBs for just the recent versions of the major
distros is likely a lot easier. Unfortunately, we have limited
resources on the MD team.
