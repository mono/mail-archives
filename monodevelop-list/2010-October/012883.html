<PRE>
When attempting to either run unit tests from within the MonoDevelop built-in
test runner or trying to debug an assembly, I noticed the following when
using the Mono 2.8 runtime on windows xp professional.
When I run the same tests on Mac OS x and open SUSE with Mono 2.8 runtime
they run fine.   

1. MonoDevelop issued the following stack trace within a TestResult.xml
output file...

Couldn't create a remote process.

at MonoDevelop.Core.Execution.ProcessHostController.CreateInstance(String
assemblyPath, String typeName, String[] addins)
&#160;&#160; at
MonoDevelop.Core.Execution.ProcessService.CreateExternalProcessObject(Type
type, IExecutionHandler executionHandler)
&#160;&#160; at MonoDevelop.NUnit.NUnitAssemblyTestSuite.RunUnitTest(UnitTest test,
String suiteName, String testName, TestContext testContext)
&#160;&#160; at MonoDevelop.NUnit.NUnitAssemblyTestSuite.OnRun(TestContext
testContext)
&#160;&#160; at MonoDevelop.NUnit.UnitTest.Run(TestContext testContext)

2. By looking at the standard Windows Task Manager and viewing processes and
resources, I noticed the following...

MonoDevelop gets an exception when attempting to launch a remote Mono.exe
process for the built-in NUnit test runner.&#160;Thereafter the MonoDevelop IDE
behaves very slowly and the performance of the machine is degraded.&#160; The
page fault graph shows lots of activity and I suspect that all the free
memory has been consumed.&#160; I further noticed that there was indeed a
Mono.exe process running in addition to the MonoDevelop.exe process. It
seems that Windows Explorer and Mono.exe are competing 
for resources and driving up page faults &#160; Although the process explorer
didn't show it initially, when Mono.exe was explicitly killed there was
suddenly 850 MB more free RAM and the page fault metric became
reasonable.&#160;performance returned to normal
  1.I guess one question is has anyone else seen this behavior on windows
platform with mono 2.8 runtime.
  2.Is there a way to make nunit 2.5 work in the GUI runner?
I have seen this behavior on 
  1. Multiple machines including a vmware machine running windows xp pro.
  2. Multiple tests including a test project that has two tests that should
always pass.
Any suggestions or ideas would be greatly appreciated
