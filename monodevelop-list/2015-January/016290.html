<PRE>bonjour,

i tried installing  monodevelop5 from the debian whizzy repo  (
<A HREF="http://download.mono-project.com/repo/debian">http://download.mono-project.com/repo/debian</A>)
as suggest on the website
i also installed from the latest mono from it, it upgraded my mono from
version 3.2 to 3.10

but I dont think it work properly at all
the fsharp suspport did not exist, and by this i mean when you create a new
file or project you dont have the f# options from in the menu
and since for monodevelop5 fsharp is bundled in
you cant add it from the add-in manager

i also noticed some icons were missing from the project menu,
when you create new file or project, the middle pane include the possible
file types etc ... each file type have a file icon to your left
the icon was missing for some or all file types

Please note i am mainly interested in F#,  and I am very new to mono
so as soon as i found that the f# support wasnt there i uninstalled it
immediatly
(i didnt try to test it much)
and removed the repo from my list and re-installed monodevelop4 from the
default ubuntu repos
but i didnt remove or downgrade mono itselft , i kept the 3.10 mono

anyway for a while things were fine until i thought to give it a second shot
(thinking maybe they fixed the fsharp support by now in a new build)

same issue existed (missing f# and icons), so i removed the repo again from
my list and reinstalled monodevelop4
but this time for some reason monodevelop crashed silently

i had to completely remove anything mono
apt-get remove mono-*

and reinstall everything, going back to mono 3.2 , to get monodevelop4 to
work again

so long story short use the debian whizzy repo under ubuntu at your own
risk

regards,
ali
