<PRE>I wasn't able to figure out why the add-in would not appear, but I was  
able to get started with a different add-in that does appear, so problem  
avoided.

&gt;<i> Hello,

</I>&gt;<i> I then tried to create my own add-in based on PythonBinding, which also

</I>&gt;<i> program.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the event that I get the add-in working, I'd also be interested in
</I>&gt;<i> knowing if it might be possible to change two behaviors of MonoDevelop,  
</I>&gt;<i> at
</I>&gt;<i> least for a specific language. I didn't figure it would be the case, but  
</I>&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;<i> might as well ask. The first is if it would be possible to show all files
</I>&gt;<i> in the project folder, rather than having to add them explicitly, and the
</I>&gt;<i> second is if it would be possible to use project files which use a custom
</I>&gt;<i> format, for compatibility with other applications.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for any help!
