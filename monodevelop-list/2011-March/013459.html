 &gt; In monodevelop, if whenever text the cursor is touching will be
 &gt; deleted if you hit ctrl+space which triggers the auto complete list.
 &gt; This has thrown me off a few times.
 &gt;
 &gt; For example, if you type else and place the cursor at the beginning
 &gt; and hit ctrl+space selecting anything from the list like if will
 &gt; delete else and replace it with if.
 &gt;
 &gt; I was wondering if maybe doing something like highlight the text that
 &gt; the cursor is touching, when you hit ctrl+space, would visually show
 &gt; that it is going to delete that text with whatever you select.

This annoys me as well.
I pretty often catch myself on doing this way of coding:
   var x = FooMethod (args);
then after some thought I would change that to:
   var x = BarMethod (FooMethod (args));
so I go with the cursor to 'F', type BM, ctrl-space, and voila!
But instead of &quot;BarMethodFooMethod (args)&quot; (which is only a few 
characters left from the target) I get &quot;BarMethod (args)&quot;.
I would prefer &quot;BarMethodFooMethod&quot; -- having cursor still at 'F',
I can always do ctrl-shift-right, del.

It's not an issue for me anymore, it annoyed me enough
to learn myself to type a space before 'F' and go left (before the 
space). And you always have Undo.
But as the issue came up for others, I would welcome a change of behaviour.
