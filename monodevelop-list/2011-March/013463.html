</I>&gt;<i>   &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   &gt;  I was wondering if maybe doing something like highlight the text that

</I>&gt;<i>   &gt;  that it is going to delete that text with whatever you select.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This annoys me as well.
</I>&gt;<i> I pretty often catch myself on doing this way of coding:
</I>&gt;<i>     var x = FooMethod (args);
</I>&gt;<i> then after some thought I would change that to:
</I>&gt;<i>     var x = BarMethod (FooMethod (args));
</I>&gt;<i> so I go with the cursor to 'F', type BM, ctrl-space, and voila!
</I>&gt;<i> But instead of &quot;BarMethodFooMethod (args)&quot; (which is only a few
</I>&gt;<i> characters left from the target) I get &quot;BarMethod (args)&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> I would prefer &quot;BarMethodFooMethod&quot; -- having cursor still at 'F',
</I>&gt;<i> I can always do ctrl-shift-right, del.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's not an issue for me anymore, it annoyed me enough
</I>&gt;<i> to learn myself to type a space before 'F' and go left (before the
</I>&gt;<i> space). And you always have Undo.
</I>&gt;<i> But as the issue came up for others, I would welcome a change of behaviour.

The other option, which Eclipse supports, is to have a toggle in the 
preferences for &quot;overwrite&quot; or &quot;don't overwrite&quot; when you're in that 
situation. That gives the best of both worlds for those who want it to 
work in specific ways (i.e. always want an overwrite when the cursor has 
text to the right of it, or always insert even when the cursor has text 
to the right of it).
