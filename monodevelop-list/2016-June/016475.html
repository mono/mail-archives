<PRE>I saw that Xamarin Studio 6.0 for Mac was released on Monday, and I went back
and found that 6.x features were in the monodevelop project on GitHub. I
need monodevelop 6.x so that I can work with the rest of my team who are
using Visual Studio under Windows and Xamarin 6.0 on the Mac to run and
debug NUnit 3.2.1 tests.  But the CentOS/RHEL repo includes only version
5.10, which doesn't support NUnit 3.2.1.  (I realize I can use command line
mono, but the UI for NUnit 3 doesn't really work, and I would get no
debugging ability outside of monodevelop.)

I've spent several days building monodevelop 6.1 and 6.0 under CentOS 7. 
I'm a noob, so the sparse instructions were very difficult for me to follow,
but I finally got a successful 6.1 build.  I was even able to see the news
screen and bring up the about box to show the version.  But shortly
thereafter monodevelop froze and crashed.  I haven't gotten that far on any
subsequent run. It sometimes shows part of the news screen, but usually just
a white screen before it crashes.  And building for 6.0 resulted in the same
behavior.  The crash appears to be occurring in GTK, but I have no idea how
to go about determining where the problem lies.

Honestly, I really don't care about building myself, I just need the NUnit
3.2.1 support.

So is there anyone who has successfully built a monodevelop 6.x for CentOS 7
that is stable?  6.0 seems to have been tagged for quite some time.  Is this
available anywhere?

Rick
