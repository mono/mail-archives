That sounds good.

&gt;<i> Giving help with developing will not a good thought because I will need
</I>&gt;<i> too much atention from someone to explain things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Until now I use Linux as Desktop Station, now I using too as Develop Box
</I>&gt;<i> and that's because I giving this many inputs in the last weeks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Other thing. I don't have yet the methodology of work that you have. I
</I>&gt;<i> don't know how can I debug easy the application because I don't
</I>&gt;<i> dominate the platform (MonoDevelop) to use and the Code Behind.
</I>&gt;<i> I will take too much time to be productive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But responding to your question, in the first release, I think that the
</I>&gt;<i> minimum features should be:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Find symbol (symbol will be parameter, property, class, etc) in both
</I>&gt;<i> ways.
</I>&gt;<i>         * Find the declaration of the Symbol
</I>&gt;<i>         * Find all the references of a Symbol (every time in the solution that
</I>&gt;<i> this symbol is use).
</I>
AFAIK these two are already &quot;more or less&quot; done.

&gt;<i> * Rename Symbol. This feature should be able to show a list is finding
</I>&gt;<i> and ask Rename All or Rename Next
</I>
Yes, I will start working on this. I am not sure what Rename Next should do?

&gt;<i> * Extract Method. Extract some selected code and promete it to a
</I>&gt;<i> separate method.
</I>
This might be a bit harder since methods are not completely covered by
the parser. At least they weren't the last time I looked. :-)

&gt;<i> All other feature can be for next releases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> hope this could me a better response for your question.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS: You can find me in the #Mono and #MonoDevelop to ask me for some
</I>&gt;<i> work. My limitations, you know. Drop a message and when came on-line I
</I>&gt;<i> answer that.
</I>&gt;<i>
