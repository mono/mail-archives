<PRE>Ankit Jain escribi&#243;:
&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /home/knocte/(...)/mcs/nunit20/nunit.sln(3): Unsupported or unrecognized
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> project: 'samples\jsharp\jsharp.vjsproj'. See logs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /home/knocte/(...)/mcs/nunit20/nunit.sln(7): Unsupported or unrecognized
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> project : 'samples\cpp-sample\cpp-sample.vcproj'. See logs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /home/knocte/(...)/mcs/nunit20/nunit.sln(11): Unsupported or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unrecognized project: 'install\install.vdproj'. See logs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Earlier you had mentioned that you were trying to load nunit20.sln, but here you
</I>&gt;<i> are loading nunit.sln . 
</I>
You're right! I got confused.
I have now tried to load nunit20.sln and it works well, no errors, so I
suppose your commit fixed it.

&gt;<i> The *20.sln references vs2005 (msbuild) format
</I>&gt;<i> project files,
</I>&gt;<i> where nunit.sln references some vs2003 projects.
</I>&gt;<i> nunit20.sln loads up fine.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The addin doesn't provide native support for vs2003 projects. I should
</I>&gt;<i> be checking on the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;format version&quot; on the .sln file i guess, and report a summary or
</I>&gt;<i> something of the errors.
</I>
I see. Well, then we have a weird behaviour in MonoDevelop :) because:

- VS2003 projects can be imported, but not used.
- VS2005 projects can be used, but not imported.


&gt;&gt;<i> I suppose that this .sln file contains project types not supported by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MonoDevelop (by now, and never I suppose), so a nice workaround to allow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to work with a solution like this would be this feature:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually the addin does try to ensure that even if it is unable to load some
</I>&gt;<i> projects the rest do open. What it _doesn't_ do right now is show up failed
</I>&gt;<i> projects solution explorer in MD. I do have that on my todo :)
</I>
It would be nice too, to give a more user-friendly message, at least for
the VS2003 case, instead of just saying &quot;unsupported or unrecognized&quot;,
what about &quot;VS2003 projects cannot be used natively by MonoDevelop yet,
but you can import it to a MonoDevelop project format&quot;?

&gt;&gt;<i> BTW: I am seeing that the project I wanted to open, when built with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> NAnt, a &quot;build\bin&quot; is created, instead of creating a &quot;build +
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Path.DirectorySeparatorChar + bin&quot;, so this is not cross-platform.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> MD uses the correct directory seperator for the files/directories. I'm not sure
</I>&gt;<i> what nant does, but i don't think that relates to MD here.
</I>
I know that this doesn't relates to MD, but the message was also being
posted to mono-list :). What I guess is that the NAnt xml file is
incorrect, but don't know how to fix it.

&gt;<i> Thanks for testing :)
</I>
You're welcome! ;)
