<PRE>R. Tyler Ballance escribi&#243;:
&gt;<i> You make this assumption that it would be the absolute default behavior,
</I>&gt;<i> and affect all users. It checks for the RETICULATE environment variable,
</I>&gt;<i> else it functions completely normally. That's why I added that, while
</I>&gt;<i> it's a fun option to enable for some of us, it would ultimately be
</I>&gt;<i> confusing for end users &quot;For some reason MonoDevelop freezes on
</I>&gt;<i> 'Burninating the Peasants...', is this a known bug?&quot; etc
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with your overall utilitarian attitude about open source
</I>&gt;<i> projects, but I don't think a clever option here and there detracts at
</I>&gt;<i> all from the overall functionality of the project. Besides, where's your
</I>&gt;<i> sense of humour, who doesn't love a good reticulated spine every now and
</I>&gt;<i> again :)
</I>
It's not that I don't have sense of humour, neither a fact about
confusing new users or not. It's that:

a) I don't understand the majority of the sentences (my mother tongue is
not English), and thus I'm not interested in seeing useless things in
the source code I manage.
b) If we add this, why don't add any other funny message from any other
different MD user that requests it?
c) This kind of modifications are precisely too specific for one user
needs and should go into a user-adapted solution, or a fork. You can
create your own version if you want to have fun with MD.

Sorry if I sounded rude, but perhaps the majority of people have the
same opinion as you and then I will shut up ;)

Regards,

	Andr&#233;s	[ knocte ]
