You make this assumption that it would be the absolute default  
behavior, and affect all users. It checks for the RETICULATE  
environment variable, else it functions completely normally. That's  
why I added that, while it's a fun option to enable for some of us,  
it would ultimately be confusing for end users &quot;For some reason  
MonoDevelop freezes on 'Burninating the Peasants...', is this a known  
bug?&quot; etc


I agree with your overall utilitarian attitude about open source  
projects, but I don't think a clever option here and there detracts  
at all from the overall functionality of the project. Besides,  
where's your sense of humour, who doesn't love a good reticulated  
spine every now and again :)
