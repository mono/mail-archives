<PRE>Hello Gideon,

    I had a chance to test the new Web Reference patch, it looks
fantastic, it is really nice, and I wanted to provide some feedback on a
few things that could make it nicer:

	* I started with an empty Console project, and added a web 
	  reference.   It failed because System.Xml was not added to 
	  the list of automatically referenced assemblies.

	* I tried adding a web reference to a web service to a server
	  that has dashes in its name (www.go-mono.com), and the dash
	  made the compilation abort (www.go-mono.com/docs/server.asmx).

	* It would be nice if I could point choose the web reference 
	  also from a local WSDL file, without having to go to the 
	  browser.

	* It would be nice to have a properties pane that allowed me to
	  pick the settings for the web service, I did not know that the
	  name was the domain name.   Or at least a way of looking at 
	  the generated code.

	  Perhaps a way of renaming the reference namespace after it has
	  been added (right now there is only update and delete).

    Other than that, it works like a charm.

Miguel
