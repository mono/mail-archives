<PRE>Hi.

I am playing a bit with the code completion window. I am planning to make it
show only those things that match what have been typed so far. The patch is
done, but it only works when not considering case. This is due to the issue
described in the following:

So suppose you have a class:

class MyClass
{
  public void A() {};
  public void a() {};
  public void AB() {};
  public void ab() {};
  public void C() {};
  public void D() {};
}

and suppose you have the following piece of code:

MyClass myClass = new MyClass(); myClass.

When you type . in the above, it will show you the list of all six methods.
If you type C, I plan to make the list shrink to show only method C and so
forth.
There is one slight problem though. The members starting with A/a will show
in the list in this order:

a A ab AB

due to the way they are sorted. I would like to sort them like this:

A AB a ab

since then it is easier to show a range of the matches. Typing A would show
A and AB. Typing a would show a and ab.
The reason this would make things easier is that the matches are stored in a
collection and then I could just show a range of the collection instead of
selecting out distinct members.

Any comments on this? Is it ok to add this sort?

/Jacob
