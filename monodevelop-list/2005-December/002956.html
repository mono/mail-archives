<PRE>Hi Hemant,

Thanks for your ideas. Some comments inline:

&gt;<i> Been working with Monodevelop and AddIns since last few days and i
</I>&gt;<i> liked the architecture. I have some random thoughts about improving
</I>&gt;<i> the general look and feel of the editor:
</I>&gt;<i>       * All the buttons and toolbar should be compact and small, so
</I>&gt;<i>         that they take less screen space.
</I>
We are using standard GNOME toolbars, so there isn't much we can do. 

&gt;<i>       * The space between, various widgets should be decrased, i see
</I>&gt;<i>         plenty of space between solution pad and the editor.
</I>
I this particular case of the solution pad and the editor, honestly, I
don't see that 'plenty' of space. In general we try to follow the GNOME
HIG.

&gt;<i>       * As Mono and Monodevelop are more like a platform, we should
</I>&gt;<i>         seperate them from the underlying Desktop(Gnome). When i use
</I>&gt;<i>         Monodevelop under KDE, the icons of files and folders would be
</I>&gt;<i>         missing. Ok, this is kind of impossible, but yet just a wish.
</I>&gt;<i>       * There is no search,backward,forward capability while browsing
</I>&gt;<i>         the help manuals. Monodoc is hardly stable, the
</I>&gt;<i>         docbrowser(desktop version of monodoc) crashes now and then.
</I>&gt;<i>         Frankly, i feel really frustrated when i browse through manual
</I>&gt;<i>         pages and finally i end up with the web version.
</I>
I use monodoc and it doesn't crash so often to me. Please file bug
reports for the monodoc crashes.

&gt;<i>       * ASP.NET editor. .NET has been created as a unified platform
</I>&gt;<i>         for Web and Desktop development. But somehow, that focus is
</I>&gt;<i>         lost when it came to Linux world.
</I>&gt;<i>       * RAD tool for ASP.NET and Glade/Stetic integration.(On the
</I>&gt;<i>         cards i guess?)
</I>
Some of this is on the way.

&gt;<i> I know guys, i should stop whining and try to do something(*yes i am
</I>&gt;<i> trying to do something*). But yet, i just wanted to put forward my
</I>&gt;<i> point of view. Without a powerful development tool, the whole Mono
</I>&gt;<i> project will be a lame saint.
</I>
Thanks for sharing your thoughts. Any help is welcome!

Lluis.
