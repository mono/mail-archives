Disagree. They should follow the Gnome HIG so that MonoDevelop feels
consistent with the rest of Gnome. I do *not* want an application that
starts doing it's own customization.

&gt;<i>       * The space between, various widgets should be decrased, i see
</I>&gt;<i>         plenty of space between solution pad and the editor.
</I>
Hm, do you think so? MonoDevelop is so far the only IDE I've been able
to use for more than five minutes, and I'm quite sure that the nice
clean look is a big part of that. Contrary to most other IDEs,
MonoDevelop does not look cluttered to me. 

I think following the Gnome HIG is a good idea, unless there are
compelling reasons to do otherwise. 

&gt;<i>       * As Mono and Monodevelop are more like a platform, we should
</I>&gt;<i>         seperate them from the underlying Desktop(Gnome). When i use
</I>&gt;<i>         Monodevelop under KDE, the icons of files and folders would be
</I>&gt;<i>         missing. Ok, this is kind of impossible, but yet just a wish.
</I>
Why? I want applications to integrate well with my desktop environment.
Otherwise, what is the point of the DE? One of the main reasons that I
choose Abiword/Gnumeric over OpenOffice, Epiphany of Firefox, etc. is
that they are all Gnome applications. That matters to me.

Mono is a platform, MonoDevelop is an IDE. I see no problem with writing
another IDE for KDE/creating a Mono plugin for KDevelop/Porting
MonoDevelop to use Qt (with whatever the C# bindings happen to be called
today). That seems like a better solution than asking all of us who use
Gnome to give up on Gnome integration.

&gt;<i>       * There is no search,backward,forward capability while browsing
</I>&gt;<i>         the help manuals. Monodoc is hardly stable, the
</I>&gt;<i>         docbrowser(desktop version of monodoc) crashes now and then.
</I>&gt;<i>         Frankly, i feel really frustrated when i browse through manual
</I>&gt;<i>         pages and finally i end up with the web version.
</I>
I also used to have problems with MonoDoc crashing, but it seems more
stable now.

&gt;<i>       * ASP.NET editor. .NET has been created as a unified platform
</I>&gt;<i>         for Web and Desktop development. But somehow, that focus is
</I>&gt;<i>         lost when it came to Linux world.
</I>&gt;<i>       * RAD tool for ASP.NET and Glade/Stetic integration.(On the
</I>&gt;<i>         cards i guess?)
</I>
I'm personally very interested in Glade3 integration. As soon as some
code lands in, I'd like to help in testing it. I hope the Glade3
integration isn't just seen as a temporary solution before the mythical
Stetic arrives.

When Glade3 and MonoUML are integrated, I think we'll have something
really nice. If only we could get Bazaar NG integration as well.. ;-)



&gt;<i> I know guys, i should stop whining and try to do something(*yes i am
</I>&gt;<i> trying to do something*). But yet, i just wanted to put forward my
</I>&gt;<i> point of view. Without a powerful development tool, the whole Mono
</I>&gt;<i> project will be a lame saint.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Partly true. To be frank, I really have no problem doing development
with Vim, Glade and Zsh. I think they are a very powerful combination.
But I do use MonoDevelop from time to time, and I think it does play a
really important role, especially for people who come from the Windows
world. And I know from interacting with them that things like integrated
UI designer is essential.
