I know this reply is a little late, but is this likely to happen in
MonoDevelop? It would be great to have gnome-vfs support when editing
ASP.NET files. I'm not familiar with how Monodevelop opens files, but
as far as I can see its architecture does not easily allow for this
kind of thing yet, as it expects views to do their own loading and
saving. Abstracting this out into an extensible loading/saving service
seems like a good idea to me, and a major API addition like this would
be better to have sooner than later, so that all the editing views can
build on it.

I mention this as I'm looking into porting the ASP.NET graphical
designer into MonoDevelop, and currently it opens files itself. BTW,
don't get your expectations up, anyone, as it won't happen for a least
a month or two with all the academic work I have ATM.
