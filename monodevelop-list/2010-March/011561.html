<PRE>Hi

&gt;<i> I have become quite familiar with the new DOM. I have partially
</I>&gt;<i> implemented a rule for CS5001 (source file must have Main) and
</I>&gt;<i> checking functions for invalid returns  <A HREF="http://pastebin.com/zPnNwvs3">http://pastebin.com/zPnNwvs3</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Again these are POCs, I had to do an ugly hack to workaround the non
</I>&gt;<i> availability of getting the ReturnType of a method. There are similar
</I>&gt;<i> problems getting their arguments as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Return types should work now. When you don't get certain information in
an AST node per property the best place to look at is the CSharpParser
that is the 'documentation' for which role the children are added to
that node and then it's easy to change the property to use the correct
rule or add the missing property.
(I take patches :)) 

&gt;<i> The new DOM is quite familiar to me now. I think this would be a good
</I>&gt;<i> project because not only will it allow me to create a useful tool, but
</I>&gt;<i> it can provide a good test case and feedback regarding the new DOM.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I plan to refactor the metrics addin to use the new DOM as soon
</I>&gt;<i> as it becomes 100% stable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I can need any feedback I can get for this new one. In this state
changes to the DOM are very easy. It's quite similiar to the NRefactory
DOM therefore the transition to the new one should be straightforward.
It should be more usable like an attributed NRefactory DOM than a
complete new one. (at least in 90% of the cases, there are small
differences because the NRefactory DOM needed to match VB.NET as well) 

Regards
Mike
