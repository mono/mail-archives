I really like the idea, and the proposal in its current state is good.
I just have a few comments:

* It might be hard to sell the idea to some other Mono mentors (who
don't use MD), so if you have other ideas, you should probably submit
multiple proposals.
* I'd suggest ASP.NET MVC instead of Django, as it would allow sharing
client/server code, and also would help to dogfood the Mono stack. I
know it can't run on App Engine, but we should be able to host it on
monodevelop.com.
* I'm not sure of the value of SVN template repositories if there's a
web service, but instead of SharpSVN I'd suggest using MD's existing
SVN providers, which work cross-platform. In fact, you could probably
use the VCS abstractions directly. However, I'd move this to the
future work section, and instead make sure the core features are
polished.
* What are the mid-term deliverables?
