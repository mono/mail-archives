Hi All

I hope you don't mind the question because there seem to be quite a few
&#8220;Book&#8221; requests.  I have been picking up the C# language from various
on-line resources as well as &#8220;C# Sharp Essentials&#8221;.  I write have a
reasonable amount of experience with C/C++ coding for numerical analysis.  

At this point, I think I  would like to move on to a GUI project that I have
in mind, which is completely new to me.  There is pretty simple GTK#
examples on-line for use with monodevelop but I think I need something more
in-depth.  I am missing some basic things like handling a second window with
buttons in a project and grabbing the mouse pointer location.  So, I was
look for a book that would cover these topic for monodevelop/GTK#.  I was
looking at &#8220;Practical Mono&#8221; by Mark Mamone.  Is this a reasonable book to
get me started?  It was published in 2005 &#8211; is that too old for the present
version of monodevelop/GTK#.

Thanks
Kev
