<PRE>Hi there monodevelopers,

Lately I've filed two bugs which I consider very important, and which
made me wonder about the real usage of features in MonoDevelop by the
community (it would be an interesting idea to have an anonymous usage
stats gatherer like recent Banshee versions BTW :)

First: an important limitation of Stetic which seems to be present in
latest stable version 2.2.1: no widget toolboxes are shown. Does this
mean that nobody is using stetic nowadays? Or am I the only one
reproducing it? Bug is
<A HREF="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=586162">https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=586162</A> . Should I raise the
severity of it?

Second: the debugger seems to hang when using the gdb backend. Any C
hackers out there that could tell me if they reproduce this? Bug is
<A HREF="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=588175">https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=588175</A> . I would like to set
the target milestone of this bug to 2.6, can I? :)

Maybe the first bug is just that I'm blind and I don't see where to show
the panels in the MD GUI, but even in the tutorial [1] I couldn't find a
clue to help me on this (surprisingly I found this bug while teaching
Gtk# to my brother, such a shame :/ ;) . This, if fixed, should deserve
a 2.2.2 bugfix release IMO.

And if the 2nd bug is resolved I think it opens an interesting use case
for MonoDevelop users who are somehow in the sudden need of debugging
low-level programs without not being gdb-experts. As a matter of fact, I
was interested in a wider scenario in which MD would be able to step
into .NET [DllImport()] calls (that is, switching from mdb/sdb to gdb).
Would this be possible?

Thanks,

	Andr&#233;s
