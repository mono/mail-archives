<PRE>Hi Krzysztof,

Both the projects you describe would be very useful, but I would
definitely prefer Stetic. It's been in maintenance mode for quite a
while, as it works pretty well as it is, and we have limited
resources, and it's difficult to work on without major refactoring. It
has a number of active users, and it would be great to breath some new
life into it.

The lightweight project model, codebehind generation, and 1
widget-per-file are all closely linked, and essentially all require a
major refactoring of stetic, keeping all the GUI-level code, but
building a new core backed directly onto the MD project model and code
DOM. A plan that's been proposed in the past was to fork stetic into a
new addin, so that backwards compatibility would not be a concern at
all, as both could exist simultaneously (though a migration mechanism
would be needed). Mike Kestner did some initial work on the
1-widget-per-file model in a hack week, which might be useful as a
starting point. Don't underestimate the size of this part, as it
probably requires discarding a third of the stetic code, and mostly
rewriting another third.

Rendering custom widgets and loading custom designers would both
require moving stetic outside the MD process (so it can be unloaded)
and embedding in MD via a GTK Plug/Socket. There's some unfinished
support for this already but I'm not sure why it was ever enabled, and
it might not survive the refactoring. FWIW back when I was working on
ASP.NET support in SoC 2006 I made the ASP.NET designer (also GTK#
widgets) run out-of-process in a week or so, so I don't expect it's
too hard.

Beyond that, a custom designer framework sounds like a good open-ended
task to work on when the core parts are done, if you have time.
