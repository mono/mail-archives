Unfortunately there are no Mono-specific books that are up-to-date -
2005 would date to book back to the first half of Mono's history, and
the first fifth of MonoDevelop's history. Fortunately MonoDevelop is
sufficiently similar to Visual Studio that most of the basics from
VS-specific books transfer right over.

There's a decent GTK# tutorial at
<A HREF="http://zetcode.com/tutorials/gtksharptutorial/,">http://zetcode.com/tutorials/gtksharptutorial/,</A> and some examples on
the Mono wiki, in MonoDoc, and in Mono GTK# SVN. The mono, monodevelop
and gtk-sharp mailing list archives also have many examples of answers
to these kinds of questions, or you could just ask again, or ask on
stack overflow.

Note that the GTK+ C examples and docs usually are quite
straightforward to translate into GTK#, and there's also a fairly
recent C-based GTK+ book available which *might* be useful for
advanced usage.

In general, one book I strongly recommend is &quot;C# 4.0 in a Nutshell&quot;
(or the 3.0 version) from O'Reilly. It's densely packed with
information about the C# language and the core framework and runtime,
with lots of tiny examples.  It doesn't cover any GUI or web or
database stuff, nor does it use Visual Studio - which means almost
100% of it applies directly to Mono on any platform. It's like a very
readable reference book, and I still find it useful after years of C#
experience. It's definitely *not* a tutorial or introduction, but an
experienced Java or C++ programmer might be able to use it as one.
Another excellent book is the Framework Design Guidelines, which
explains the design principles behind the .NET framework.
