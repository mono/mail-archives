<PRE>Hello everyone,


I am seasoned C# developer with couple years experience, recently
helping develop Pinta.

I would like to participate in GSOC. Before I start investigate
implementation details

needed for GSOC application process, i need some guidance, which idea is
more

worthy to pursuit. My goal is to improve MonoDevelop usability and
productivity

needed for writing native Gtk applications.


I have two proposals :

   -

   I was thinking about working on Stetic. On projects page there are couple
   tasks which can be

   combined into one (1-widget per file, lightweight project model,
   improvements for generating

   partial files). Besides them I would try to implement some enhancements
   needed for using

   custom widgets. Maybe support for custom designers and editing non simple
   widget properties.


   -

   Currently, there is lack of reporting tool for Gtk. I've played a bit
   with <A HREF="http://www.fyireporting.com/">http://www.fyireporting.com/</A>

    which is open source C# implementation of Microsoft RDL. It is using
   Apache2 license

    and has good separation between platform independent core and various

    viewers (PDF, Html etc.)  Its engine is well written and capable of
   rendering many reports

    designed in  Sql Business Intelligence Studio.

    Under linux it is using windows forms for its viewer and designer
   tool. I would like to

    implement them natively using Gtk with cairo. Ideally, designer could be
   implemented as

    Monodevelop addin.



 I am myself leaning towards working on Stetic because it could be
beneficiary for more people,

but don't know if that kind of project is feasible for GSOC.

Thanks for your comments and suggestions.
