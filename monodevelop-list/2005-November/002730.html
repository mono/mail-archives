<PRE>&gt;<i> Still I would prefer to see this setting in the preferences dialog of
</I>&gt;<i> monodevelop.
</I>
That wouldn't really be the right place. How many settings would you
want there? If a setting can sensibly read from the system, it should
be. I feel strongly about this kind of thing, given how many times
I've has to set the http proxy in 5-6 locations on this system when I
move network environment, and I'm grateful for apps that are sensible
enough to read the Gnome proxy setting or the http_proxy environment
variable. I don't want to have to change my default browser in more
than one place either.

&gt;<i> (The time might come, that people use monodevelop even on windows...)
</I>
Hopefully :-) In that case, Windows' default browser should be used.

Why not work out a way for MonoDevelop to read KDE's settings without
introducing dependencies? Or even better, some kind of gconf proxy to
read KDE settings for all your Gnome apps :-)


Regards,

Michael
