<PRE>Hi,

 

Having installed KDE and a host of other things from Fink, I've had a
predominetly good experience using the software.  The one thing I really
want to get up and running tho is monodevelop, and it seems to be the one
thing I cannot get to work!

 

I'm running out of steam here - I've googled the issue and found a few
people with the same issue, but no solution.  I've even tried the blind
reinstalling monodevelop - no luck.

 

Basically depending on my environment setup I get one of two errors.  If I
include the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH as recommended on most mono setup pages I get
this error almost immediately:

 

Pango-WARNING **: Cannot open font file for font Verdana

 

Pango-WARNING **: Cannot open fallback font, nothing to do.

 

My environment set up would be as follows - although only the
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH seems to make a difference here:

 

DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/sw/lib:/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Curren
t/lib/

PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/sw/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/X11R6/lib/pkgconfig:/Library/

DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib

 

 

Now if I just unset DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH and try to run it, it gets as far as
The Workbench starting to load in the loader that pops up and then I get the
following error:

 

MonoDevelop.Services.ILoggingService [(null)] - Creating DefaultWorkbench 
Loading error, please reinstall : 
System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an
object 
in &lt;0x00184&gt; Gdl.DockLayout:SetupObject (System.Xml.XmlNode node)

in &lt;0x00064&gt; MonoDevelop.Commands.InitializeWorkbenchCommand:Run () 
in &lt;0x00864&gt; MonoDevelop.SharpDevelopMain:Main (System.String[] args)

 

 

I'm at sea here - has anyone see either error.  Which is the correct way to
proceed, and what is required?

 

Many thanks for any advice,

 

Phil.
