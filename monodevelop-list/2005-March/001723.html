Just for informational purposes, I will only likely be doing bug fixing
and _maybe_ C# parser related stuff if anything at all for the near
future.  So either when there is a new release or if people are testing
a recent svn version reporting parsing/completion related bugs would be
great. There have been 4/5 of these fixed since the 0.5.1 release.

Things I know about:
- C# 2 features will likely mess up completion
- enter/double-click should complete
- 0xdead type numbers are not parsed correctly (because of code that
depends on an apparent .net 1.1 bug)

Things that I would like to have time to do or would help someone else
with:
 - auto-formatting text
 - error underlining (this basically works, except for a few bugs)
