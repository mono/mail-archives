<PRE>Until now we use MD itself but without combines (using the files pad) or
other generic editors.

That were because until now, we had C/C++ code in GdlDock - I think. In
last few days there had been some changes, and I believe we no longer
have C/C++ code.

I believe we can now do some combines for it, yet there are many logic
in MakeFiles I don't believe we can have using MD build system. The
question is if we need that logic?

I believe we all would make much more if we had MD self-hosting, but I
think someone may be waiting to another build system like nant or
something....
