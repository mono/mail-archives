yeah, sorry
my plan was to post it on the MD wiki, but there seems to be a problem
with registering a new user

</I>&gt;<i>

i am aware of those things, but there are several problems with the
existing code

GtkSourceView:
- it is very difficult (it's actually an ugly hack) to create extra
rulers (for example code folding)
- Although it has the ability to highlight the current line, you
cannot highlight multiple lines (completely, not the bg color of some
text), this would be very usefull for a diff viewer, ...
- end of line handing, \n &lt;&gt; \r\n &lt;&gt; \r
- small issues like, double clicking &quot;doMD5&quot; will only select &quot;doMD&quot;
- customizable right-click menu
- ...

Refactoring:
- I'm not saying we should re-invent the wheel, it's just an idea i
was having to integrate the refactoring code more in the text editor
(actually, not in the text editor, but a layer on the textbuffer or
something like that)
- existing SD code doesn't have C# 2.0 support (again, not
re-inventing, just adding :))

&gt;<i> Also, you may not be aware of the previous port of the SharpDevelop
</I>&gt;<i> texteditor which did many of these things in only C# code and the
</I>&gt;<i> related discussion that happened when we moved from that one to the
</I>&gt;<i> current gtksourceview-based one.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The main issue with the current approach, in my opinion, is limitations
</I>&gt;<i> by having mixed c/C# code to do these things.  So I would recommend
</I>&gt;<i> a first approach is to either port gtksourceview to C# on top of
</I>&gt;<i> Gtk.TextView or revive the old port of the SharpDevelop editor.  At the
</I>&gt;<i> point
</I>&gt;<i> where either of those is done it would make sense to talk about moving
</I>&gt;<i> on from there.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
indeed, i'm not aware of previous porting (i'm following MD
development for only 1-2 months, i don't know anything about what
happened before)

probably, i didn't make it clear enough, this is nothing more then
information gathering
making a list of everything that should be in good source editor, and
afterwards decide what could be done
