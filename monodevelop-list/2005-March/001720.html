I think I am not communicating this well, but I think coming up with
this list is likely to end with the conclusion 'we need to write
an(other) editor', which already happened once and was not really
completed.  Whereas approaching with &quot;I know these are the specific
problems that cannot ever work this way&quot; should be the first step.
Since we know the parser (with and without C# 2) will work with both the
SD editor and our current one it is likely to confuse this issue.

But, if the only real problem is having better control of things
internal to gtksourceview we know the answer is port it to C# so we
can integrate with the parser, override the menus, etc.

The original text editor was very flexible and the only reason I
remember being valid for switching from it was accessibility and
right-to-left support (surely I am forgetting something important).
It was perhaps slow and buggy because it was only an initial port.
At some point I hope someone revives it.

Hope that helps.

Most of it should be captured in this lists archives, about 1 year ago I
think. It should be rather easy to find (google at least).
