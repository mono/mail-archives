OK.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> It should be a project configuration option.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. changing .prjx schema to remove version info for GAC refs and add

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This isnt needed at all, or acceptable. You should (via the GUI) allow

</I>
Sorry, I wasn't clear.  I meant a *per-configuration* project option.
The idea would be that you could have a Debug-Mono-1.0 config and a
Debug-Mono-2.0 config.  The references (and more importantly their
versions) are currently specified project-wide, so I think the .prjx
format would need to change to handle that.

Thoughts?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. removing ref version info from the Edit References GAC tab 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just don't show the references that match to the other set, removing ref
</I>&gt;<i> version info is bad, and will not be accepted.
</I>
Again, I was thinking of a per-configuration project option.  It wasn't
clear what version info to show in that case.  I thought showing the
version info for only the active config might be confusing.

&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;<i> &gt; 4. adding an option to the project config options to select mono-2.0 vs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mono-1.0.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is the important bit, the rest of the gui changes just hinge on
</I>&gt;<i> this one being correct.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, in order to be forward thinking, instead of serializing this as
</I>&gt;<i> a bool, we might want to use something more flexible. Just something to
</I>&gt;<i> think about.
</I>
Agreed.  I was thinking a &quot;targetRuntime&quot; enum.  Initial valid values
would be &quot;mono-1.0&quot; and &quot;mono-2.0&quot;.  Sound right?

&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, I'd appreciate any info on differences beteen gmcs usage and mcs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; usage?  &quot;gmcs --help&quot; and &quot;mcs --help&quot; produce almost identical results.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are none (that I know of)
</I>
FYI, I tried using gmcs and, IMO, it is still too unstable for
widespread use.  I ran into a number of bugs that were specific to gmcs.
How confident are you that it is wrong to compile with mcs when
targeting mono-2.0?  Who would know for sure?
