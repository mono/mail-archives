0.6 won't be released until near mono 1.2's release date. We required
gtk# from svn (or a recent release), etc, so releasing any earlier is
counter-intuitive.

We are contemplating putting out a 0.5.9 release, but packages for that
would not be available unless someone from novell was willing to build
them. (As they have in the past, however, this is a bit harder than
before because we would need gtk# 2.0 packages as well).

Sure. We don't have one. There are a couple reasons we don't have one.
The biggest one being that this is a totally community driven project.
Stuff gets done when it gets done.

As far as big picture goals, we plan on integrating with stetic, having
some asp.net stuff, and more debugger integration. Other than that,
patches are accepted for anything and everything. I am sure various
contributors have different goals (lluis seems to be working on a new
solution pad that would be more flexible, jluke seems to be working on
everything, as usual ;), and chris seems to be interested in database
interaction, and potentially some version control integration).

As far as my personal goals, my available time is pretty limited right
now, but I am attempting to help out with general patch review, and
general stuff as much as possible. Hopefully when stetic matures some
more, I will be working on integrating the two.

Does that answer your questions?
