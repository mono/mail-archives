MonoDevelop's initial design goal was to provide a quality IDE for
Gnome, with an emphasis on C# and .NET languages. So immediatly SWF is
at odds with the 'Gnome' bit.

You have to keep in mind that this is an opensource project, so all I
can speak to is my own time spent on it, not yours, or anyone elses. I
can also state fairly accurately that no very active MD developer that I
know of has a large interest in it (but I could be wrong).

So, write it, and like I said, we will give svn access, and when the API
internally changes we will make sure it changes as well (as soon as it
is part of the default build).
