</I>i am merely trying to create a list of features, ... that need to be
taken into account when designing the editor, so i think all parts of
MD that are somehow linked to the source editor are worth mentioning
right now

the more things we can think of now, the more flexible the design can be

</I>last couple of weeks, i studied some parts of SD/MD and eclipse source
code, to see how things are done
if you have some more information about older discussions about the
source editor, please let me know

i really appreciate your feedback, keep it coming :)
