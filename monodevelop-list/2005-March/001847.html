<PRE>libgnomeprint works on windows. Some binary dlls are up on those links
if your interested that I have compiled. libgnomeprintui however won't
work because of libgnome deps and orbit/bonobo deps but thats ok because
gtksourview only needs libgnomeprint. The current gtksourceview compiles
correctly (although doesn't work correctly entirely yet) if you disable
the tests when you build. 

I wanted to wrap all calls to gnome and vfs behinds abstract internal
classes in MD and call them with reflection instead using runtime checks
instead of using the preprocessors stuff I added. A lot of what I was
working with changed however in the current tree and it was partially
nasty. Most of the reason why that was so huge was I changed some
combine files that existed in the tree at the time so it was a massive
change. The changes won't apply any more as the tree has be relayed out.

I started my gecko# port initially to help my port of MD but never got
back to win32 stuff for MD but I still want to get back to it. :-)
