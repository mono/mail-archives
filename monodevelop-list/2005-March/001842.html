<PRE>Hey guys.... I really like the initiatives you guys are taking with .NET on linux.  I wish more programmers understood good .NET was and how much it would help Linux compete in the open market.  I was wondering if you guys were going to do a port to make monodevelop run on both sides, windows and linux.  It would be a dream to build .NET software on both sides and just have them compile on linux.

</I>&gt;<i> Some of the underlying libraries will likely be ported with evolution to

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think you should be able to write a portable Gtk# application using

</I>&gt;<i> you might want to be aware of is since we are pre-1.0 there is no API
