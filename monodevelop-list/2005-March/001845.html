<PRE>Well MD is really heading in a different direction since the fork of the
SD code tree. MD is also more favorable then SD for lot of reasons in my
opinion. Also having an identical environment on both platforms just
makes it easier to anyone wanting to write additions to MD.=20

I keep emailing the list and it seems like no one reads my messages. :-)
I have gtksourceview ported. I ported gecko# to win32 (hard dependency)
and other things to win32. Existing versions of libgnomeui elements that
haven't been ported have some mono gtk versions.  The biggest issue is
VFS which I already have some win32 apis to get around. I've been
through  this many many times :-). <A HREF="http://www.polystimulus.com/">http://www.polystimulus.com/</A> and
<A HREF="http://monodevelop.zacbowling.com/">http://monodevelop.zacbowling.com/</A> both have some of my work on the
subject. I have 90% of it built and working. I need to write a VFS work
around for reading the lang attributes from the xml based lang files for
gtksourceview (VFS does it nicely). I need to write a work around for
VTE stuff. I need a to write a work around for some of the path things.
Past that it should almost work.=20

Hope that helps.
