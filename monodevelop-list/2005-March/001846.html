You need to submit these changes at some point to the respective 
upstream places and have them accepted.  Looking at the above link I see 
one out of date and fairly unreadable 440k patch.  It is possible you 
did nasty things to get it to work that won't be accepted.  By the way, 
vte is not used by monodevelop right now.

For example, I am fairly certain gtksourceview will work on win32 by 
making gnome print support optional.  Since we dont use that part 
anyways, why not make a patch for just that and submit it to them?
