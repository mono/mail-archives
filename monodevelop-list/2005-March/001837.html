<PRE>Hello,

Early on when MonoDevelop was first released I think I read something
along the lines of 'at present, MonoDevelop runs only on linux'.  I'm
interested to know what is required to run MD on Windows, but using Gtk#
rather than SWF (which has already been discussed recently).  I've only
just started getting familiar with Gtk#, but all the examples I've tried
so far have worked on Windows as well as linux, so I'm wondering what
the main problem areas are, and whether any effort is currently going
into this. 

The MD Core + Addins architecture looks ideal as the framework for a
number of my own applications that I'd like to bring up to date, but
again it would be nice to have both linux and Windows versions with the
same GUI toolkit, rather than build one up using SWF and the other with
Gtk#.

Any advice or pointers would be most welcome!
