We depend on a shrinking amount of gnome specific stuff. By shrinking, I
don't mean we are actively removing them, I mean that they are starting
to work on windows also.  Two things here: 1) some gnome c-libs do not
have win32 ports yet 2) libgnomeui is sort of deprecated and these
things are moving into GTK+ in newer releases.

Some of the underlying libraries will likely be ported with evolution to
windows.  Some (like gtksourceview and the managed dock) may already
work as is or with small changes.

I think you should be able to write a portable Gtk# application using
the core of monodevelop without too many problems right now.  One thing
you might want to be aware of is since we are pre-1.0 there is no API
stability assurances right now.
