<PRE>Ah!

Thank you very much for this information!

I don't want to uninstall XCode4 and replace with the earlier version, as I
don't want to risk screwing up my Unity setup, which is deploying very
nicely to iOS using XCode4.

However, I have read that one can have multiple versions of XCode installed
on a single machine.
I was unable to see a setting however in MonoDevelop that specifies the
location of XCode; are you aware of a way to set MonoDevelop to use a
specific version of XCode?

Please forgive me if there is an obvious answer; I have not long moved over
to the Mac from a PC (in order to develop for iOS), and I am still very much
finding my feet!

/Ideally/ I would like to have two entirely separate versions of XCode so I
can happily upgrade any version without worrying about affecting the other
setup.

Many thanks,

--Mike--
