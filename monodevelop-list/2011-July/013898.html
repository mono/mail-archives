<PRE>Hello:

I've been developing C#.NET applications for sometime now and have been in the business of developing business applications some 20+ years.  About 5 months ago i became interested in iPhone development when i happened upon MonoDevelop.  I found a book on Books24x7.com which i've worked through and have an iPhone app underway which i feel pretty good about.

That said, I've been finding that the more i dive into this development environment the fewer comprehensive references and development support help i find.  I'm starting to get into more advanced levels of development, but keep running into &quot;walls&quot; as the learning curve steers me.  It seems to me that learning Objective-C is an inevitable reality, and so I am working through learning the language as well.

But the going is slow, and being accustomed to tons of .NET support and stuff you can find on Google I'm becoming a bit frustrated with my progress.  I'm kind of at a lost in deciding if I should stick with MonoDevelop or switch over to Xcode and Objective-C and could use some good advice on which direction I should go.  Also, can one build components in Xcode/Objective-C and use them in MonoDevelop?

Further, I would welcome any information on MonoDevelop support, books, tutorials, samples, forums, online chats, any other kind of MonoDevelop and/or Xcode development resources, etc.  In particular I would like to master the art of showing a view that my users can flip the pages with their fingers, like when reading a book.  I've seen this kind of thing, but can only find samples on how to do it in Xcode/Objective-C and would really rather do it in MonoDevelop.


Best Regards,
Jim
