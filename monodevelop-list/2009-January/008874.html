Did you build the mdb debugger addin?

You'll need MD 2.0 alpha 2 or later (right now SVN trunk is superior
to alpha 2), and Mono 2.0 or 2.2 with the Mono debugger.

If you're using MD packages, such as the ones in the openSUSE buidl
service, you just need to install the monodevelop-debugger-mdb
package.There are some one-click installs for openSUSE:
<A HREF="http://software.opensuse.org/search?baseproject=openSUSE%3A11.1&amp;p=1&amp;q=monodevelop-debugger-mdb">http://software.opensuse.org/search?baseproject=openSUSE%3A11.1&amp;p=1&amp;q=monodevelop-debugger-mdb</A>

If you build MD from svn, use .&quot;/configure --select&quot; and you'll be
able to select which &quot;extras&quot; you want to include in the build. Make
sure you select MonoDevelop.Debugger.Mdb. Note that building from SVN
is convenient because you can &quot;make run&quot; to run MD without installing
it, so you won't interfere with installed MD packages.

If you build MD from tarballs, you'll need to configure and build the
monodevelop-debugger-mdb tarball against a matching install of MD.


For the easiest and most reliable way to get it working, I suggest
using my packages on openSUSE 11.1 (the home:MJHutchinson package at
the link above), as I regularly push new build when bugs are fixed.
