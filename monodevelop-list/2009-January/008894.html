&gt;<i> Hi all,

</I>&gt;<i> I am using the latest SVN trunk and I am experiencing some strange GUI
</I>&gt;<i> issues. These only seem to occur in Mono Develop (not other GTK Sharp
</I>&gt;<i> apps). They occur with the current release as well as the SVN.  I have
</I>&gt;<i> uploaded a screen shot to illustrate.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://img185.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshotbansheehalbanuy6.png">http://img185.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshotbansheehalbanuy6.png</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are two separate issues in that screen shot.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The first is the greying of all the status bars and tabs in the middle
</I>&gt;<i> of them. This only occurs when using the fairly popular Aurora GTK
</I>&gt;<i> Theme engine (<A HREF="http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Aurora+Gtk+Engine?content=56438">http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Aurora+Gtk+Engine?content=56438</A>).
</I>&gt;<i>  Its a very odd effect I haven't seen in any other app. It only
</I>&gt;<i> happens with this theme, unfortunately it happens to be my favourite.
</I>&gt;<i> Can anyone think of anything particular that Mono Develop does that
</I>&gt;<i> might be causing this effect. Mono Develop remains functional and
</I>&gt;<i> stable through out it just looks odd. This also happens if I run
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop via gksudo so it runs as root.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To illustrate the second issue I have taken another screen shot.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://img300.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshotoptionscb8.png">http://img300.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshotoptionscb8.png</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The second is the tool bar at the top of the main window and many of
</I>&gt;<i> the label colours are wrong. This happens no matter which GTK theme I
</I>&gt;<i> have and doesn't bare any relation to the colours in the Gnome
</I>&gt;<i> Appearance Preferences. Again I am not getting this effect in any
</I>&gt;<i> other GTK Sharp or native GTK app. I have noticed if I run Mono
</I>&gt;<i> Develop as root it displays correctly, so its clearly something to do
</I>&gt;<i> with my account.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Where is it getting these odd colours from? I have tried removing all
</I>&gt;<i> the Mono develop config files I could and reinstalling to no avail.
</I>&gt;<i> What I don't understand is why half the labels in that dialogue are
</I>&gt;<i> white and half black. Surely if it were simply a wrong colours setting
</I>&gt;<i> it would be the same colour for all the labels text.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone got any ideas or suggestions for either of these issues ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Charlie M
</I>

The first one seems to be a bug in the theme, and got no idea about the
2nd one, but if I were you I would try to create small testcases with
the issues and open bugs for them upstream.

Regards,
