<PRE>Hi.

* Martin Matusiak &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monodevelop-list">numerodix at gmail.com</A>&gt; [2009-01-22 13:24]:
&gt;<i> Monodevelop has, but then it'd be awkward to build the app outside
</I>&gt;<i> linux. And while Monodevelop says it supports Visual Studio
</I>&gt;<i> import/export, for some reason I can't just open the solution and
</I>&gt;<i> build it in VS, I get a few errors.
</I>
What version of MD are you using?
Do you use .sln and .csproj in MD? And can't open them in VS?
My team is using MD and VS with the same solution and project files
(.csproj) without any problems (using MD trunk).
So it may be some bug if yours aren't working.

&gt;<i> So what I'm looking for is a way to build the application from the
</I>&gt;<i> command line, and in such a way that it works across platforms. To
</I>
mdtool solution.sln
works fine under linux. I don't yet know how to build .sln file
from cmd on windows, because I haven't needed that.

&gt;<i> Does nant work well? Is there something else that works? What's the
</I>&gt;<i> best practice?
</I>
I won't recommend nant. It is much harder to read and write then
makefile, and doesn't really give you any benefits over it.
If nant would have a big collection of tasks then maybe... but for
now using nant was always a burden for me.
For easy builds .sln and mdtool are sufficient, for some more
sophisticated ones I always end up doing bash scripting inside nant.
