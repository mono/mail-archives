<PRE>Hi all,

Is there a major break between the latest Mono, and the Mono version  
used for the MonoDevelop development? When I compile MD with the  
latest Mono (2.3), the compilation goes fine (read: I get an  
executable and a bunch of assemblies), but when I run MD, I get some  
warning and errors. What is additionally weird is that for some reason  
the build directory is used, whereas the installed MD is called (~/ 
local/bin/monodevelop). See first error for this.

Googling each time brings me to 'major breaks' between versions, more  
related to .Net though. One post was mentioning that one of the  
changes was 'to use the more secure method of requiring the user to  
specify the full pulbic key, rather than the publickeytoken.'

Any ideas?

Bart
