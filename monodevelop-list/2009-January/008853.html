<PRE>Having used Resharper on a previous job, I like that they have it all on the
first-level context menu, but vary the list according to where you are in
the source structure. Taking your example, if you are in a field you can
rename it but not the class it is contained, but you can do some actions on
the class like moving it to another namespace or source-file, I think the
key word is to have commands that are  &quot;unequivocally&quot; associated with the
current context OR (exclusive) its containers. If I want to rename a class,
I should position the cursor on its name or, maybe, in first-level
whitespace in it: a blank line inside the class definition block, but not
inside a member's definition block.

Just my 2 cents,

&gt;<i> I recently implemented &quot;Go to definition&quot; and &quot;Find references&quot;

</I>&gt;<i> allows them to be bound to keyboard shortcuts, F12 and Shift-F12.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I haven't committed them yet as I have a few concerns about
</I>&gt;<i> how it relates to the existing refactoring/navigation context menus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, MD dynamically generates submenus for the symbol under the
</I>&gt;<i> cursor, and its enclosing/parent items, i.e. the enclosing member, the
</I>&gt;<i> enclosing class, and (if it's a variable) the type. Each of these
</I>&gt;<i> menus allows refactoring and navigation operations on the associated
</I>&gt;<i> item.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are a few problems with this. Since the submenus are dynamically
</I>&gt;<i> generated, user extensions cannot add new refactoring operations to
</I>&gt;<i> the menu, nor can extensions override the handling of these commands.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, the commands cannot be keybound -- and even if they could, it
</I>&gt;<i> would not be obvious which commands the shortcuts would apply to,
</I>&gt;<i> since the menus contain identical commands.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, my question is: are all of the submenus really necessary? How
</I>&gt;<i> useful is it to be able to implement members on a class from the
</I>&gt;<i> context menu on a field within it? What I'd like to do is replace all
</I>&gt;<i> these menus with a simple refactor/navigate menu that would apply only
</I>&gt;<i> to the item under the cursor, as this would be keybindable and
</I>&gt;<i> extensible. However, would it be noticeably less usable or functional?
