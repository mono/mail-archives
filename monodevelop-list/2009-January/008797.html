I found that I was having the same problem using my PowerBook, but I may
have found another path to complete the steps listed in the instructions the
original poster was referring to (which can be viewed at
<A HREF="http://www.monodevelop.org/Creating_A_Simple_Solution">http://www.monodevelop.org/Creating_A_Simple_Solution</A>). Here we are
instructed to:

&quot;...right click on the Solution icon in the Solution Pad. Select 'Add-&gt;Add
New Project'. From the 'New Solution' window, select 'C#' as the language
and 'Library' as the template...&quot;
--quoted from Step 2: Create a Library Project

Can this also be accomplished through the File menu? For example, by
creating a new Solution (using the Library template) and saving it to the
current Solution's directory? Would that do the job? Or is there something
else that needs to be done in order to tie the two together?

Further, we are instructed:

&quot;...specify the startup project (i.e. the project which is built and run
when using the &quot;Run&quot; command) by right clicking on the Solution icon in the
Solution pad and choosing &quot;Options&quot;, then Common-&gt;Startup Properties...&quot;
--quoted from Step 3: Using the New Library

I believe (but am not certain) this can be accomplished by selecting the
Solution icon and then using the menu Project-&gt;Options to open the Solution
Options dialog box. From there you can select the Startup Project icon
(located in the General area) to set that up. Am I right or am I totally
wrong about this?

Next we are instructed to right-click the References node to open the Edit
References dialog. Can the same be accomplished by selecting the References
node and then (again) using the menu Project-&gt;Options, this time selecting
the Makefile Integration icon (located in the General area) to access a set
of tabs which include References? I have a feeling I'm way off on this
particular one, but I'm throwing it out there just in case...

Since us Mac users don't (traditionally) have two-button mice, would it be
possible to set up our Solutions and set up our Startup Project preference
and edit our References using the command line?
