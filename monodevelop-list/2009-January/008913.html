It looks like two things have the file open in exclusive mode.
However, it's odd it should be able to delete the file but not write
out the contents.

&gt;<i>From the stack trace it looks like our new source editor doesn't use
</I>our &quot;safe&quot; file write API, which writes the new files to a temp file,
then renames it to the desired name. This would at least have
prevented the destruction of the file's contents. I've now fixed that
in SVN. I doubt it'll fix what you're seeing, but it might help.
