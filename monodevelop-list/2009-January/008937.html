<PRE>The naming and various versions can cause some confusion. Here's a rundown:

Mono is the runtime, MonoDevelop is the IDE. Their version numbers have no
direct relationship.

Mono versions have no direct correspondence with .NET version numbers,
because different parts of Mono have different levels of completion. For
example, Mono 1.2.x supported some .NET 2.0 runtime features; Mono 2.0
supports almost all of .NET 2.0 and most of .NET 3.5, but almost none of the
APIs that were added in .NET 3.0. As you can see, versioning it in a
completely clear way is not easy!

Mono can be split into the parts that correspond to .NET 1.1, called the
&quot;1.0 profile&quot;, and the parts that correspond to .NET 2.0/3.0/3.5, called the
&quot;2.0 profile&quot;. Packagers sometimes break these into separate packages. They
also sometimes break the components only needed by developers into a &quot;devel&quot;
package. In particular, Debian/Ubuntu try to break it into as many pieces as
possible, which makes typical installations smaller but can be very
confusing for users. For example, the mono-2.0-dev package is the developer
components for the 2.0 profile -- the &quot;2.0&quot; in the name has nothing to do
with the Mono version, and it doesn't include MonoDevelop.

MonoDevelop can usually be found in a package called simply &quot;monodevelop&quot;.
The stable release is 1.0, which runs on Mono 1.2.4 or later, and has full
support for the 2.0 profile. MonoDevelop 2.0 is currently in beta and
requires Mono 2.0 or later. It has C#3 and debugging support among its new
features.

Version numbers in Mono core dlls mean little, as they are set to be
compatible with .NET's dlls' version numbers. These are probably all the 2.0
numbers you see, since MD runs on the 2.0 profile. The 2.12/2.10 dlls are
probably GTK# or GNOME#, and their versions reflect that of the native
libraries they wrap. The 1.0 numbers will be the MonoDevelop dlls.

To see the Mono version, run &quot;mono --version&quot; in a terminal. I'm guessing
1.9.1 :-)

Thanks very much for the quick reply. However, I'm more confused than ever
now.

I was saying that I had MonoDevelop 1.0. I just tried again to download and
install the MonoDevel package--mono-2.0-dev. I was told that it was
upgraded, but when I ran MonoDevel, I got the same version as before. It
says it's version 1.0, copyright 2000-2008. The DLLs have various version
numbers, including 1.0, 2.0, 2.10, and 2.12.

I have no idea which version of Mono I have, and don't know how to tell.
When I look at the list of Mono-related files in the Synaptic package
manager, they mean almost nothing to me, and most of them do not show
version numbers. How do I know?

Again, thanks for the help.
