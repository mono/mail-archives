<PRE>Hi all,

I am using the latest SVN trunk and I am experiencing some strange GUI
issues. These only seem to occur in Mono Develop (not other GTK Sharp
apps). They occur with the current release as well as the SVN.  I have
uploaded a screen shot to illustrate.

<A HREF="http://img185.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshotbansheehalbanuy6.png">http://img185.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshotbansheehalbanuy6.png</A>

There are two separate issues in that screen shot.

The first is the greying of all the status bars and tabs in the middle
of them. This only occurs when using the fairly popular Aurora GTK
Theme engine (<A HREF="http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Aurora+Gtk+Engine?content=56438">http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Aurora+Gtk+Engine?content=56438</A>).
 Its a very odd effect I haven't seen in any other app. It only
happens with this theme, unfortunately it happens to be my favourite.
Can anyone think of anything particular that Mono Develop does that
might be causing this effect. Mono Develop remains functional and
stable through out it just looks odd. This also happens if I run
MonoDevelop via gksudo so it runs as root.

To illustrate the second issue I have taken another screen shot.

The second is the tool bar at the top of the main window and many of
the label colours are wrong. This happens no matter which GTK theme I
have and doesn't bare any relation to the colours in the Gnome
Appearance Preferences. Again I am not getting this effect in any
other GTK Sharp or native GTK app. I have noticed if I run Mono
Develop as root it displays correctly, so its clearly something to do
with my account.

Where is it getting these odd colours from? I have tried removing all
the Mono develop config files I could and reinstalling to no avail.
What I don't understand is why half the labels in that dialogue are
white and half black. Surely if it were simply a wrong colours setting
it would be the same colour for all the labels text.

Anyone got any ideas or suggestions for either of these issues ?
