<PRE>After some fiddling I finally figured this out.  For anybody who finds this
later, the key to getting information about an addin that is not being
detected is to run MonoDevelop through the console with logging enabled (
<A HREF="http://monodevelop.com/Developers/Articles/Logging">http://monodevelop.com/Developers/Articles/Logging</A>).  If a potential addin
is found in the search directories, but it can't be added to the
Mono.Addin registry, there will be some helpful messages on the console.

Also, for anybody who might be trying this on a Mac, part of the reason it
took me a long time to figure this out is that the console output seems to
be finicky.  I've currently got two terminals open, one of which gives me
nice console output, and one of which just shows an exception where the
logging initialization failed.  At the moment, I don't know what's causing
the difference.
