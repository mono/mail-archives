&gt;<i> What's the story on this? Can one use Glade-3 with Monodevelop, and if
</I>&gt;<i> so how? or do we wait until the integrated GUI designer is released with
</I>&gt;<i> Monodevelop?
</I>
The story is the following:

When the first Glade-3 development snapshot was released some months
ago, it looked like a good chance to integrate a GUI designer in
MonoDevelop. Glade-3 provided, for the first time, a set of widgets
which could be easily integrated into an application like MD. Moreover,
the development of Stetic (the GUI designer specially designed for Mono)
was stopped since Dan (the maintainer) had to move to another Novell
project. That's why the glade-3 integration work started.

However, after doing the main integration work, it became clear that
Glade-3 fell a bit short of functionality (in its current development
status) for what we want to achieve with MonoDevelop. So, given the fact
that I'll have to spend time hacking on a GUI designer in order to match
the needs of MD, I prefer hacking on Stetic rather than on Glade-3. So
that's what I've been doing the last weeks. I plan to commit the new
integrated designer next week.

To summarize: MonoDevelop will have its own GUI designer (based on
Stetic). There won't be Glade-3 integration (unless somebody else wants
to continue the work for some reason).

Lluis.
