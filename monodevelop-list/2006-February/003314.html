<PRE>Hi.

Thanks for all the input. It is very usefull. I was wondering if you could
please create bugzilla entries for the issues (especially the bugs).

Thanks,
Jacob

</I>&gt;<i> I just decided to take another look at monodevelop so I took a svn
</I>&gt;<i> snapshot and developed a little toy project with it. Monodevelop is
</I>&gt;<i> getting better each time I look at it, but it's still far away from
</I>&gt;<i> eclipse in java mode. Anyway I wrote down some of the issues I faced
</I>&gt;<i> while developing this toy project. I hope this is usefull info for you:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> General:
</I>&gt;<i> ~~~~~~~~
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;File/New File&quot; menu entry is very confusing when you have a project
</I>&gt;<i> open.  Because it does not as you would expect add the file to the
</I>&gt;<i> project but it just creates an independent file somewhere on your disk.
</I>&gt;<i> (Is this feature usefull at all? I can't imagine a very usefull
</I>&gt;<i> situation myself at least...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A very common task is creation of new classes and interfaces. The
</I>&gt;<i> intuitive way to do so would be clicking on the class browser and
</I>&gt;<i> finding 'New Class','New Interface' and such in the context menu (maybe
</I>&gt;<i> with a dialog that lets me set some options for the generated class).
</I>&gt;<i> The IDE should deal with all the boring background stuff like placing a
</I>&gt;<i> file somewhere, adding it to the project, ...  The current way where you
</I>&gt;<i> have to work on the file level (ie. adding new cs files instead of new
</I>&gt;<i> classes/interfaces) is not as easy and intuitive to use. A very good
</I>&gt;<i> example on how these things should work can be seen in java mode in the
</I>&gt;<i> eclipse IDE.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After adding a new file to the solution the editor should open this
</I>&gt;<i> file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Typically you use the class browser to lookup methods in other classes.
</I>&gt;<i> Often you also want to see the parameters needed. It would be very
</I>&gt;<i> helpfull to add a tooltip that displays them when you hold the mouse
</I>&gt;<i> over a method.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The fileselector for opening projects should only display .mdb files
</I>&gt;<i> (Because as beginner you have no idea what from these mds, pidb and mdp
</I>&gt;<i> file is your project)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The IDE should open the most recently used project after startup. Would
</I>&gt;<i> be even nicer if all open editors and other open windows would be
</I>&gt;<i> restored. Theideal would be a feeling like the IDE gets just suspended
</I>&gt;<i> when you quit it, so that you can seamlessly continue development next
</I>&gt;<i> time you start it. -&gt; I just found an option for loading the most
</I>&gt;<i> recently used project on startup in the preferences, however it didn't
</I>&gt;<i> work for me and I wonder why it isn't enabled by default and why anyone
</I>&gt;<i> would want this option or the other behaviour at all)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When adding new classes and interface a .cs is automatically appended to
</I>&gt;<i> thename (providing some feedback about that would be helpfull). This is
</I>&gt;<i> not true when adding xml files for example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can add new files to the project by right clicking on the solution and
</I>&gt;<i> using Add/New File... unfortunatley I can't do that for Resources.
</I>&gt;<i> (There's just &quot;Add Resource&quot; which needs an existing file)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be helpfull to be able to specify the encoding of files in the
</I>&gt;<i> project.Along with a projectwide setting for file encoding.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Long messages in the error list are annoying to read as you have to
</I>&gt;<i> scroll left/right all the time. Wrapping the text would be alot better
</I>&gt;<i> here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Removing files from the project should ask the user whether he already
</I>&gt;<i> wantsto remove the file from disk (as this is often the case). This
</I>&gt;<i> should be done instead of this &quot;are you really sure?&quot; dialog box.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Intellisense/Code completion:
</I>&gt;<i> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Eclipse has this very usefull feature where it automagically writes the
</I>&gt;<i> needed import statement when you select a class in the intellisense
</I>&gt;<i> list. It should be possible to do the same for the usings in C# I think.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After finding a function with the help of intellisense and writing the
</I>&gt;<i> opening '(' you often want to know what parameters are required.
</I>&gt;<i> Pressing CTRL+Space after the opening '(' should display them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When typing in the classname of a nonexistant class and then hitting
</I>&gt;<i> CTRL+Space (example type &quot;XmlReader&quot; (without an using System.Xml
</I>&gt;<i> statement in your app) hit CTRL+Space and all you typed will be remove
</I>&gt;<i> and replaced with something else from the list (_AppSettings in my
</I>&gt;<i> case), very annoying as you have to type the stuff again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Editor:
</I>&gt;<i> ~~~~~~~
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When using convertTabsToSpaces option, then 4 spaces should still feel
</I>&gt;<i> like a tab. Ie. if you press delete or backspace on 4 spaces they should
</I>&gt;<i> all be deleted at once, when navigating with the cursor, jump 4 spaces
</I>&gt;<i> at once.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Smart indentation seems to be only performed after pressing return. It
</I>&gt;<i> wouldbe better to get the feedback about the indentation operations a
</I>&gt;<i> bit earlier.  A good example is when you write a '}' then you expect the
</I>&gt;<i> indentation to instantly decrease 1 level. As this doesn't happen until
</I>&gt;<i> you press return you often find yourself removing the indentation
</I>&gt;<i> manually before pressing return on the line.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bugs:
</I>&gt;<i> ~~~~~
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Smart indentation only works when a file has been saved (happens when
</I>&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;<i> use the File/NewFile menu entry)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The class browser is not updated when you created new files (A button to
</I>&gt;<i> manually refresh it would be usefull at least until all bugs in the
</I>&gt;<i> class browser are ruled out)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The newly generated class and interface files use tabs for indentation,
</I>&gt;<i> evenwhen you have your editor set to convert tabs to spaces.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When you change tabsToSpaces option, smartindenting will still use the
</I>&gt;<i> old setting until you restart the whole IDE
</I>&gt;<i>
