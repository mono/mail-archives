<PRE>Thanks Lluis, what sort of timeline are we looking at until there is a
functional GUI designer in MonoDevelop? I don't have a lot of free time,
but if there is anything I can do to help, I would be happy to do so.
Testing, documentation spring to mind, perhaps debuging.

regards

Tracy Barlow

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What's the story on this? Can one use Glade-3 with Monodevelop, and if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so how? or do we wait until the integrated GUI designer is released with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Monodevelop?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The story is the following:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When the first Glade-3 development snapshot was released some months
</I>&gt;<i> ago, it looked like a good chance to integrate a GUI designer in
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop. Glade-3 provided, for the first time, a set of widgets
</I>&gt;<i> which could be easily integrated into an application like MD. Moreover,
</I>&gt;<i> the development of Stetic (the GUI designer specially designed for Mono)
</I>&gt;<i> was stopped since Dan (the maintainer) had to move to another Novell
</I>&gt;<i> project. That's why the glade-3 integration work started.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, after doing the main integration work, it became clear that
</I>&gt;<i> Glade-3 fell a bit short of functionality (in its current development
</I>&gt;<i> status) for what we want to achieve with MonoDevelop. So, given the fact
</I>&gt;<i> that I'll have to spend time hacking on a GUI designer in order to match
</I>&gt;<i> the needs of MD, I prefer hacking on Stetic rather than on Glade-3. So
</I>&gt;<i> that's what I've been doing the last weeks. I plan to commit the new
</I>&gt;<i> integrated designer next week.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To summarize: MonoDevelop will have its own GUI designer (based on
</I>&gt;<i> Stetic). There won't be Glade-3 integration (unless somebody else wants
</I>&gt;<i> to continue the work for some reason).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Lluis.
