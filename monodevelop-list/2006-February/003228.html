<PRE>David Makovsk&#253; (Yakeen) escribi&#243;:
&gt;<i> we have inconsistent and broken POTFILES.in file in trunk...
</I>&gt;<i> That's not good situation for translators to keep updated translations,
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't we include an rule for patches that this is rule to keep it
</I>&gt;<i> uptodate? Some notice on Wiki will help to remind people when doing
</I>&gt;<i> refactoring or adding new files with translation strings...
</I>&gt;<i> Have someone any ideas for automatic checks on commits?
</I>&gt;<i> Can we have some automatic method for notify translators that some files
</I>&gt;<i> have changed their strings?
</I>
I think the most proper way is the one it's done with Mozilla products 
cycle: some days (about 15) before a release is going to happen, there 
is a &quot;l10n&quot; freeze, no one can change more literals before the release 
date. The localizers then have this time to update their localizations.

BTW, I am preparing a patch that fixes this POTFILES issue and also 
includes some unlocalized strings into the Gettext ecosystem of MD. 
Hopefully I will have it ready to post this evening.

Regards,

	Andr&#233;s	[ knocte ]
