<PRE>Success !!! Since mono 2.0 was just released I decided to get the
source tar and build it rather than using a recent SVN build. Anyway
with mono 2.0 installed I reran the installed Mono Develop, it had the
same problem as before.

Anyway I decided to make install the SVN build that was installed. I
did a make clean then an SVN update (I think updated it 2 days before)
then reconfigured, built it. Initially I ran it via make run, that
worked fine. So I make installed it and now its running really well.

I now have an odd theme bug which makes the centre of the tabs and
scroll bars fade to white. Its hard to describe, buts that's a problem
for another day. I have had this before with this theme. It only
happens in mono develop not banshee or any other GTK Sharp app.

I am not sure if moving back to mono 2.0 solved it, the reinstall
process or perhaps something in the SVN update I did.

Anyway thanks again for the previous suggestions.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> MD version so that they don't share the same DB.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thank you for your suggestions. I have tried removing all references
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to Mono develop then reinstalling including removing the mono develop
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> config folder in the home directory. I still can't get it working.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Also, using &quot;make run&quot; to run MonoDevelop without installing it is a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> good plan when running development versions, as this should never
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> conflict with installed versions.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> That sounds like the best way to run development versions. I have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> tried running both the latest SVN and the 1.0 build this way and both
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> still have the same problem. Would they not be effected if there was a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> problem with a library in the GAC or does mono develop not install its
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> libraries to the GAC?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MD doesn't put anything in the GAC at all. However, Mono.Addins and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> GTK# are in the GAC. What Mono and GTK# versions do you have, and how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> did you install them?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry I missed this bit from my last reply. Everything is installed
</I>&gt;<i> from a recent SVN check out. They are all built as per normal and
</I>&gt;<i> installed with the prefix /usr.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mono its self is built from the SVN so I could get a recent version
</I>&gt;<i> for the debugger. The original reason I was using  SVN versions and
</I>&gt;<i> not the current release. Mono appears to be working fine with other
</I>&gt;<i> lagre mono applications (like banshee), so I am fairly confident its
</I>&gt;<i> install is good.
