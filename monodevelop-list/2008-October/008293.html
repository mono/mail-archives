<PRE>I am converting an application from MS/VS/VC# to MD/C# and have the need to prompt the user for some information in a 'window' that is called from the main application.  For this I am using a Dialog and if the response is not valid, I want to stop the OK button from exiting with Ok and thus wish to do the VS equivalent of e.cancel = true which stops the event from executing completely, thus not returning, and thus not returning Ok.  I know that I could return a different response but that seems (to me anyway) the wrong way to approach the problem.  I looked at the System.EventArgs but there were not any fields so I could not see an equivalent.  So, is the above possible in a Gtk.Dialog, or is this a case when a Gtk.Window would be better (but then I cannot centre the window on the main window as I've been there and tried that and this is one of the reasons I am using a Dialog) ?
It is probably something simple but for the life of me I can't find it !  Any help would be much appreciated.

 
Brett Senior.
