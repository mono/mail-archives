Hi all,
I'll come right out and say that I'm no linux pro, not by a long shot. I'm
running Fedora Core 9, and used to work in C# when I was back on Faildows,
and really need to get Mono working, as I don't really have the free time to
learn Java or suchlike.

To get to the point: I'm having a few hiccups installing MonoDevelop, I have
so far, taken the following steps:
- Added the Mono repo.
- Yum install mono-complete mono-develop
- I have also installed Gtk-Sharp and GtK-Sharp2

&gt;<i>From the outside, everything seems like it should work fine (after some
</I>tweaking with dependancies), the installation went off without a hitch. Mono
starts on the task-bar, but I see no window itself, running it as root, in a
terminal produces the following output

[/code]

My first thought, was ofc to reinstall mono-addins, which I did, which was
when I noticed something strange, the mono-addins package installs a MUCH
more up to date version than 0.3.0.0, 0.3.1.x, if memory serves, so as far
as I can see, the solution to the problem might be something to do with mono
not looking for the correct file.

Though I concede, that it's equally possible, if not moreso, that I've just
made a stupid mistake somewhere down the line. Any advice that anyone can
offer would be very appreciated.

Regards.
