Thank you for your suggestions. I have tried removing all references
to Mono develop then reinstalling including removing the mono develop
config folder in the home directory. I still can't get it working.

&gt;<i> Also, using &quot;make run&quot; to run MonoDevelop without installing it is a
</I>&gt;<i> good plan when running development versions, as this should never
</I>&gt;<i> conflict with installed versions.
</I>
That sounds like the best way to run development versions. I have
tried running both the latest SVN and the 1.0 build this way and both
still have the same problem. Would they not be effected if there was a
problem with a library in the GAC or does mono develop not install its
libraries to the GAC?

To illustrate my problem I have uploaded a screen shot to image shack.

Is this likely a symptom of a damaged project addin, if so wouldn't I
likely see an error message of some sort in mono develop. Can I use
the addin managed to check if the correct addins are loaded and their
versions?

Thanks again.
