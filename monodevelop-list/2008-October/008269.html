<PRE>Hi all,

I am still having problems, but this is getting more confusing. I
figured I would build Mono Develop 1.0 from source so I had project
editing. It installed it /opt. So I have both version installed. When
I run the 1.0 version I get exactly the same problem. I checked the
about dialogue, which clearly shows it to be version 1.0.

My problem is all of the project editing menu items are grayed out.
Even the short cut control S doesn't save the currently open document.
The save all icon does seem to work. The build and run buttons all
work fine. All the project editing menu items are disabled even the
edit references menu item.

What's really confusing me is how can this happen to the 1.0 version.
Currently I am having to add files to a project by manually editing
the project file.

Does anyone have any suggestions?
