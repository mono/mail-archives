</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your suggestions. I have tried removing all references

</I>&gt;<i> config folder in the home directory. I still can't get it working.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, using &quot;make run&quot; to run MonoDevelop without installing it is a

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That sounds like the best way to run development versions. I have

</I>&gt;<i> still have the same problem. Would they not be effected if there was a
</I>&gt;<i> problem with a library in the GAC or does mono develop not install its
</I>&gt;<i> libraries to the GAC?
</I>
MD doesn't put anything in the GAC at all. However, Mono.Addins and
GTK# are in the GAC. What Mono and GTK# versions do you have, and how
did you install them?

&gt;<i> To illustrate my problem I have uploaded a screen shot to image shack.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is this likely a symptom of a damaged project addin, if so wouldn't I
</I>&gt;<i> likely see an error message of some sort in mono develop. Can I use
</I>&gt;<i> the addin managed to check if the correct addins are loaded and their
</I>&gt;<i> versions?
</I>
I'd expect to see error messages, yes. Could you try a clean rebuild
of MD with &quot;make clean&quot;, &quot;svn st&quot; to check no files have somehow been
locally modified, re-configure at the top level, and build again, then
&quot;make run&quot;. That should 99% ensure nothing is &quot;damaged&quot;.

Does this hppen with other projects?
