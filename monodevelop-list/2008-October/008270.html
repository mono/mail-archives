The addin database may be getting mixed up between these versions.
Also, if you have installed multiple versions of MonoDevelop into the
same location without removing older version, you may have conflicting
incompatible dlls installed.

I suggest clearing out the ${prefix}/lib/monodevelop for each of your
installations, then reinstalling. Also try removing the addin database
at ~/.config/MonoDevelop/addin*

Note that with multiple versions of MD using the same addin DB, there
may be some confusion. You could try overriding MONO_ADDINS_REGISTRY:
<A HREF="http://monodevelop.com/Environment_Variables">http://monodevelop.com/Environment_Variables</A> when running one of your
MD version so that they don't share the same DB.

Also, using &quot;make run&quot; to run MonoDevelop without installing it is a
good plan when running development versions, as this should never
conflict with installed versions.
