</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> MD version so that they don't share the same DB.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thank you for your suggestions. I have tried removing all references
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to Mono develop then reinstalling including removing the mono develop
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> config folder in the home directory. I still can't get it working.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Also, using &quot;make run&quot; to run MonoDevelop without installing it is a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> good plan when running development versions, as this should never
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> conflict with installed versions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That sounds like the best way to run development versions. I have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tried running both the latest SVN and the 1.0 build this way and both
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> still have the same problem. Would they not be effected if there was a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem with a library in the GAC or does mono develop not install its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> libraries to the GAC?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MD doesn't put anything in the GAC at all. However, Mono.Addins and
</I>&gt;<i> GTK# are in the GAC. What Mono and GTK# versions do you have, and how
</I>&gt;<i> did you install them?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To illustrate my problem I have uploaded a screen shot to image shack.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is this likely a symptom of a damaged project addin, if so wouldn't I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> likely see an error message of some sort in mono develop. Can I use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the addin managed to check if the correct addins are loaded and their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> versions?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd expect to see error messages, yes. Could you try a clean rebuild
</I>&gt;<i> of MD with &quot;make clean&quot;, &quot;svn st&quot; to check no files have somehow been
</I>&gt;<i> locally modified, re-configure at the top level, and build again, then
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;make run&quot;. That should 99% ensure nothing is &quot;damaged&quot;.
</I>
Thank you for your suggestions. Unfortunately it hasn't resolved the
problem. The output of svn st after make clean is below:
?      profiles/default

Is that normal does this mean there is a problem.


&gt;<i> Does this hppen with other projects?
</I>
Well most of the projects I have tried it on were all created by
Visual Studio 2005 however they worked fine on the build of
monodevelop from august. To check I created a new project with
monodevelop, it had exactly the same problem so I don't think its the
project files at fault.

When running make run with the new project there are no error messages
at all on the command line or in the mono develop gui.

What should I try next ?

Thanks again for the help.
