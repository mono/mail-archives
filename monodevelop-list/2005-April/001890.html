might be slightly out of date.

But, the preferred method of installing for those unfamiliar with
unix/linux should be:
- yum/apt/red-carpet (which automatically resolve dependencies)
- rpms/other packages
- the automated installer
- build from source last

Hopefully, when mono 1.2 and gtk#2 are released we will be easier to get
up and running.
