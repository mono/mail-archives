Hi,

I'm running a new installation of Fedora Core 3 and I've installed the =
following rpm's (not in this order, in the correct order according to =
the dependencies I think...)

gecko-sharp-0.6-1.novell.9.1.i386.rpm
gtk-sharp-1.0.6-0.novell.9.1.i386.rpm
gtksourceview-sharp-0.5-1.novell.9.1.i386.rpm
monobundle-1.0.6-2-installer.bin
mono-core-1.1.6-1.novell.9.2.i386.rpm
mono-data-1.1.6-1.novell.9.2.i386.rpm
mono-devel-1.1.6-1.novell.9.2.i386.rpm
monodevelop-0.5.1-1.novell.9.1.i386.rpm
monodoc-1.0.5-1.novell.9.1.i386.rpm
mono-web-1.1.6-1.novell.9.2.i386.rpm
xsp-1.0.6-1.novell.9.1.i386.rpm

Most things seem to work fine - I can run mcs and gmcs from the command =
line and compile and run things that way. MonoDevelop starts up ok and =
seems to work quite well - editing is fine etc. When I try to build a C# =
Console project using monodevelop (i.e. F8), I get the following in the =
bottom pane of the IDE :

------ Build started: Project: Test Configuration: Debug ------

Performing main compilation...
Build complete -- 0 errors, 0 warnings

---------------------- Done ----------------------

Build: 1 succeeded, 0 failed

so everything looks fine - however no output file is produced - no .exe. =
I have searched the entire hard drive using 'find' to see if the output =
was put somewhere different than bin/Debug but I can't find it anywhere.

If I hit F5 to run, I get an error saying: cannot open assembly =
/root/Projects/Test/bin/Debug/Test.exe

I'm quite new to Linux, so I could be missing something really obvious =
here, but does anyone have any idea what's going on and how I can fix =
this?

btw. I previously installed the monobundle and everything worked fine =
including building and running with monodevelop, but I wanted to use =
version 1.1.6 of mono so I uninstalled monobundle using the uninstaller =
and installed the rpm's individually.

Thanks

Steve Willcock
