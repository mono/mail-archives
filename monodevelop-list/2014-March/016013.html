Thanks a lot for your answer, it confirms what I was thinking about.

I'm currently working on a CentOS 5 embedding a gtk+-2.10 and gnome 2.16. On
this platform I successfully build and use a C# environment based on
gtk+-2.18, gnome-2.28, mono-2.6 and monodevelop 2.4 (+ dependencies).

I wish to upgrade that C# environment as I'm moving to CentOS 6.
Nevertheless, CentOS 6 embedded gtk+-2.18 is still below my needs, but
embedded gnome-2.28 is just fine. So I tried to build an environment based
on gtk+-2.24, mono-3.2 and monodevelop 4.2. Not rebuilding a gnome from
sources anymore. But after I posted on monodevelop ML, I had the true
feeling that my error was bounded to the fact that I did not rebuild gnome
from sources anymore. Indeed, as CentOS 6 embedded gnome-2.28 is build with
gtk+-2.18, only upgrading gtk+ to 2.24 and then using gnome 2.28 above it,
is not a good idea.

As you mention it, do you know, how deep should I self-compile part of my
system to avoid such problems ? I know the question is wide but some advice
will be appreciate.

At the moment, I consider that rebuilding gtk+ and gnome, as before, is a
good start.

Thanks a lot for your help.

Regards,
