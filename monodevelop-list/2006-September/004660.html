Still there is no reason to call it dictatorship. I agree that it would 
have been better to take that statement of the website. It certainly 
prevents discussions like this.  But the fact that the logo has never 
been used in an official release is not an argument to keep developing 
it. Isn't it more important to spend time developing MD to improve it, 
then keep wasting time on developing a logo? I mean the logo is 
important, but there are as many different tastes as there are people.

Regards,
Arjan.
