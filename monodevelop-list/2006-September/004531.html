</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In our particular case rather than building dlls for classes we want

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; them without having to have other projects around.  To tell you the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; truth I never considered adding projects to build things because I've
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; been used to doing things with c/c++ where you end up with all kinds
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of output files and the like.  Its probably within reason for us to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have a project in our common directory and add this project to each of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the solutions that need to use those common files.  I still like being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; able to just add them and refer back to them but I certainly see your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; point that it could be done using other project files.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This case is very strange and I would advice you the same that Lluis has
</I>&gt;<i> noted. BTW: perhaps we should make for this feature a special
</I>&gt;<i> information message that warned the user about the fact that the linked

</I>&gt;<i> a shared class library unless he knows what he is doing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Is it all that strange?  Rather than create projects and add them to
svn I can simply link to a file or two and I'm all done :-)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, I looked in the icons directory but I wasn't able to find the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; icons for the c# files in the treeview.  Once I find those it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; shouldn't be too bad to create a link version and then I'll look for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how to use the link icon for linked files.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just wondering... Wouldn't the &quot;overlay icons&quot; (instead of normal icons)
</I>&gt;<i> be a better solution for this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes it sounds like a better way.  Is there an example in MD that
already uses overlay icons?
