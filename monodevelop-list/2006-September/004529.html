<PRE>Hello.

Chris Morgan escribi&#243;:
&gt;<i> In our particular case rather than building dlls for classes we want
</I>&gt;<i> to include them directly.  This lets us more easily modify and rebuild
</I>&gt;<i> them without having to have other projects around.  To tell you the
</I>&gt;<i> truth I never considered adding projects to build things because I've
</I>&gt;<i> been used to doing things with c/c++ where you end up with all kinds
</I>&gt;<i> of output files and the like.  Its probably within reason for us to
</I>&gt;<i> have a project in our common directory and add this project to each of
</I>&gt;<i> the solutions that need to use those common files.  I still like being
</I>&gt;<i> able to just add them and refer back to them but I certainly see your
</I>&gt;<i> point that it could be done using other project files.
</I>
This case is very strange and I would advice you the same that Lluis has
noted. BTW: perhaps we should make for this feature a special
information message that warned the user about the fact that the linked
source is not commonly the most elegant solution, and telling him to use
a shared class library unless he knows what he is doing.


&gt;<i> Also, I looked in the icons directory but I wasn't able to find the
</I>&gt;<i> icons for the c# files in the treeview.  Once I find those it
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't be too bad to create a link version and then I'll look for
</I>&gt;<i> how to use the link icon for linked files.
</I>
Just wondering... Wouldn't the &quot;overlay icons&quot; (instead of normal icons)
be a better solution for this?

Regards,

	Andr&#233;s	 [ knocte ]
