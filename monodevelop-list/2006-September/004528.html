Excellent news.  I'll see how things work after that change.

In our particular case rather than building dlls for classes we want
to include them directly.  This lets us more easily modify and rebuild
them without having to have other projects around.  To tell you the
truth I never considered adding projects to build things because I've
been used to doing things with c/c++ where you end up with all kinds
of output files and the like.  Its probably within reason for us to
have a project in our common directory and add this project to each of
the solutions that need to use those common files.  I still like being
able to just add them and refer back to them but I certainly see your
point that it could be done using other project files.

I'll see how well things work after your change.

Also, I looked in the icons directory but I wasn't able to find the
icons for the c# files in the treeview.  Once I find those it
shouldn't be too bad to create a link version and then I'll look for
how to use the link icon for linked files.
