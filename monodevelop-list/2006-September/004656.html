<PRE>&gt;<i> I wouldn't call it dictatorship. At some point there has to be made the 
</I>&gt;<i> decision to stop change the logo. It is not good to change your logo 
</I>&gt;<i> continously, because a logo is a brand. People recognize a logo and it 
</I>&gt;<i> is important to position yourself in the market. So I can understand 
</I>&gt;<i> this decision. Eventhough this is an open source application, it still 
</I>&gt;<i> needs a recognizable brand and to become popular. And after all that is 
</I>&gt;<i> what we all want... Popular open source applications for everyone, used 
</I>&gt;<i> by everyone. Maybe Lluis should have told it differently, but that is 
</I>&gt;<i> merely a choice of words. It is all marketing. Something most of us 
</I>&gt;<i> don't deal with, but is still a part of the acceptance of an 
</I>&gt;<i> application.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Arjan.

The problem Arjan is that logo that we are talking about has not been even
been used at all, not on the website and not on the new release 0.12.
Correct me if I am wrong but MonoDevelop has never had an official logo,
hence it state on the website and I quote:

&quot;We need a logo! It would be awesome if somebody could design a decent logo
and splash window for MD.&quot; 

Here is a link to the page that I am referring to.

I truly understand branding and marketing, hence way I realize how important
it is that a product looks good!!!
