<PRE>This is a preliminary patch to allow out-of-project files to be added to a 
project.  This is useful when trying to move common classes to a directory 
outside of a given project.

The patch removes the code that was preventing users from adding files from 
outside of their project directory.  I also added an option to the 'add' 
dialog to &quot;Link&quot; a file, beside the existing options to &quot;Copy&quot; and &quot;Move'.

MD can now successfully add the files to the project, they show up in the 
treeview and the solution compiles properly.

What I can't figure out is why this change seems to be causing mono to 
segfault when one of the linked files is removed but not when removing a 
non-linked file.  I'm using mono from svn and mcs from svn, updated tonight.  
I tried running mono under gdb but the stack trace wasn't very clear, the 
segfault occurred in the garbage collector so maybe memory that was in use by 
gtk-sharp was freed?

I don't understand monodevelop code well enough to know where to look for the 
issue but I was hoping someone would be able to lend a hand so we can get 
this useful feature implemented.

Chris
