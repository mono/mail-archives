</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Hi.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The attached patch adds a goto class dialog (written in MD's GUI
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; designer!) to MonoDevelop. The GUI is still a bit crude,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it is, indeed ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't hope it's that bad! :-)
</I>
I forgot to mention the lack of HIG compliant spacing between the
controls, and the lack of a border in the tree view :-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The ideal design would have an entry box where you would type the name
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the class and the dialog would find any class matching the substring
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (including the namespace in the search). The list of classes needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sorted.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a matter of fact I started out with an entry box. But since the
</I>&gt;<i> treeview offers the same functionality
</I>
Well, not in gtk versions older than gtk 2.4. In any case, what's weird
about the dialog is that it has a label explaining how the dialog works.
It is necessary because it is not so evident that the tree can do that
kind of search. If you put a text box in the top where the user can
enter the class name you don't need to add usage instructions, since
it's very clear how it will work.

However, I admin that doing it in this way is more work, so the tree
search is better than nothing.

&gt;<i>  I deleted it again. The dialog
</I>&gt;<i> is not meant to be used for class searching. It is a &quot;go to
</I>&gt;<i> class&quot;-dialog. 
</I>
Yep, so it has to offer you the most efficient way of selecting the
class you want to jump to.

&gt;<i> Searching for classes is better to put in the &quot;Search
</I>&gt;<i> In Files&quot;-dialog IMO. The list should be sorted of course. Just didn't
</I>&gt;<i> do it yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; but it should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; be functional enough.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; A few comments:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; * I could not find a way to make the menu item appear after Goto Line
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; even though I used insertafter. Maybe due to the order in which the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; menu is built?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yeah, that's probably the problem. The search entries are added by the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; editor add-in, whose commands are loaded after the IDE commands.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So to make this work I would have to change the editor add-in menu
</I>&gt;<i> items to place them around the ide menu item. Is this issue not a bit
</I>&gt;<i> problematic?
</I>
In fact the commands are defined in the IDE, but the menu items are
added by the editor add-in. We could move the menu items to the IDE as
well, this would solve your problem.

Lluis.
