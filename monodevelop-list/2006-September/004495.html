</I>&gt;<i> The patch removes the code that was preventing users from adding files from
</I>&gt;<i> outside of their project directory.  I also added an option to the 'add'
</I>&gt;<i> dialog to &quot;Link&quot; a file, beside the existing options to &quot;Copy&quot; and &quot;Move'.
</I>
This is an interesting and useful idea, but I wonder what implications
this has on other parts of MD, for example those that use
project-relative filenames. When should code use the 'real' filename
and when should it use the 'project' filename? A more robust solution
would probably be to create actual filesystem links, so that either
can be used to access the file.

&gt;<i> MD can now successfully add the files to the project, they show up in the
</I>&gt;<i> treeview and the solution compiles properly.
</I>
There's a usability issue here. In the treeview there needs to be a
special icon for linked files, and a way of editing the link.

&gt;<i> What I can't figure out is why this change seems to be causing mono to
</I>&gt;<i> segfault when one of the linked files is removed but not when removing a
</I>&gt;<i> non-linked file.  I'm using mono from svn and mcs from svn, updated tonight.
</I>&gt;<i> I tried running mono under gdb but the stack trace wasn't very clear, the
</I>&gt;<i> segfault occurred in the garbage collector so maybe memory that was in use by
</I>&gt;<i> gtk-sharp was freed?
</I>
Could you post this segfault? It may be something to do with the
issues I mentioned above.

&gt;<i> I don't understand monodevelop code well enough to know where to look for the
</I>&gt;<i> issue but I was hoping someone would be able to lend a hand so we can get
</I>&gt;<i> this useful feature implemented.
</I>
No problem, I'm happy to give you pointers.
