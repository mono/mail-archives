<PRE>The problem was pinpointed to the EditActionCollection class.

The &quot;state&quot; argument of the GetAction method has a default value of 8192
when no modifier keys are active, and so the action.State ==
filteredState condition was always false.

Considering that this issue seems to be affecting only me, this is
probably an abnormal behavior, maybe due to some very recent and
possibly buggy version of gtk installed on the system.

Anyway, the problem was solved by applying the attached patch. I believe
the patched version is the formally correct way of expressing the
desired condition. It is left for consideration by any developer that
may be lurking the list.

Best regards,

Duarte Cruz
