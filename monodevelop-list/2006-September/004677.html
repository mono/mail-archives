<PRE>Well, I agree that there are many better websites. There is always a 
better one. However comparing it to a company like Microsoft is not 
fair at all. They  have a huge bank account and can afford such 
websites. And still it is crap that they produce. Many developers of 
website forget what the real function of a website is. Personally I am 
not really fond of the sites that you mentioned. Too much information 
on one page without a clear overview. As a visitor, I want to be able 
to see where I can find things within 1 second. Most websites, 
especially of bigger companies, aren't like that. Furthermore a complex 
website, as you suggest, takes more time to maintain. And I think that 
most of us at the mailinglist have a job and don't have that much time 
to maintain sucha site. Anyway, it is ok that there are changes made to 
a logo and/or a website. But I mainly reacted to Gideon's message, 
because I thought that the use of the word dictatorship is not at place 
here and that stop developing the logo to keep it the way it is now, 
can be justified. I am not questioning someone's taste, nor the fact 
that developing the MD logo is stopped.

Regards,
Arjan.
