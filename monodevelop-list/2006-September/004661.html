&gt;<i> &gt; I think there is no point in opening the logo discussion again. People
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the list already gave their opinion on the colors to use. The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; original colors where the most preferred colors.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Lluis
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Isn't that a bit dictatorship like?
</I>
It's not. Those who cared about the logo already gave their opinion.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are some that in a later post indicated that they thought it was a
</I>&gt;<i> good idea to open it up again and then have a vote on it and open up the
</I>&gt;<i> vote to people outside of the monodevelop development community, to get
</I>&gt;<i> their feedback.
</I>
We asked to the MD community (the mailing list is both for users and
developers). Asking to people not related to MD will lead us to a better
decision? Who should we ask? and how?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thought we are supposed to be a community, where people can voice their
</I>&gt;<i> interest ideas etc. Thought open source meant open in every sense of the way
</I>&gt;<i> and not dictatorship. Maybe it was a very novel and innocent of me to think
</I>&gt;<i> that.
</I>
Yep. Calling dictator to somebody who takes decisions is pretty naive.

Lluis.
