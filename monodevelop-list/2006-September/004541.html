They only show up when the correct designer is active. The toolbox
will in future be used for other designer, and for text snippets.

&gt;<i> What does 2. mean? I don't have any controls to put anywhere.
</I>
When you're using the designer, you have ASP.NET web controls on the
design surface. You'll recognise the issue if you see it :)

&gt;<i> I'm running Mono 1.1.17.1, so 3. seems irrelevent.
</I>
I'm not sure if the problem was fixed before 1.1.17.1 was released or not.

&gt;<i> I installed MonoDevelop from the RPM (I'm using the SuSE 10.0 RPMs), so
</I>&gt;<i> 4. should have have been done.
</I>
Nope, the visual designer has not been officially released, and is
only available by building MonoDevelop from source.

&gt;<i> &gt; and make sure that MonoDevelop is using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the same Mozilla runtime into which the XUL runtime was installed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How? I'm using Mandriva Linux 2006 with KDE 3.5.4 (with GNOME 2.1.2), my
</I>&gt;<i> version of Mozilla is 1.7.11. My default browser is Firefox 1.5.0.6
</I>
Since you have both Mozilla and Firefox, it is possible that the
Monodevelop startup script will detect and use a different Mozilla
runtime to the one against which which JSCall# was built.
Unfortunately, AspNetEdit will only work if MD uses the same runtime
as JSCall#. You can force the Mozilla runtime with &quot;export
MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME=/usr/lib/mozilla&quot; (or wherever Mozilla or Firefox is
installed).

&gt;<i> I still don't have any option for a Designer view, I can only see the
</I>&gt;<i> aspx as html, but the code behind now displays correctly in the solution
</I>&gt;<i> treeview. The test web application does compile and run but MonoDevelop
</I>&gt;<i> hangs.
</I>
Do you have XSP installed? I really need to do runtime detectection of this...
