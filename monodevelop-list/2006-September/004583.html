<PRE>Hey Baris,

&gt;<i> Hi; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm working on PHP Language Bindings for MD. 
</I>
That's very good news!

&gt;<i> To make it useful enough
</I>&gt;<i> for PHP developers, major features for this binding should be command
</I>&gt;<i> completion and compiler integration. But before that some other MD
</I>&gt;<i> editor enhancements/addition might also necessary. I just wanted to ask
</I>&gt;<i> if those should go into Add-in part or the core part of the editor. Some
</I>&gt;<i> of them are:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Line wrapping: Currently MD does not have option to switch line
</I>&gt;<i> wrapping on and off. From my discussion on IRC some stated that for
</I>&gt;<i> developing C# it's not recommented to line wrap. But for PHP codes you
</I>&gt;<i> ran into long lines very often, speciallyf or SQL queries. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For that reason, line wrapping is a major UI enhancement for PHP codes.
</I>&gt;<i> I know that it's trivial to implement, because of text editor widget
</I>&gt;<i> already supports that. But should that go into MD or Add-in? 
</I>
I think this should be an option of the MD text editor.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Replace in selection: PHP development needs lots of code copying and
</I>&gt;<i> pasting, and mostly it's very easy to find/replace in selection.
</I>&gt;<i> Currently MD find and replace dialog lacking &quot;Look in selection&quot;. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> not quite sure if it's possible to add that into Find/Replace dialog
</I>&gt;<i> with Add-in but I also think that this feature might be usefule for C#
</I>&gt;<i> coding. I remember needed that in past as well. So should it be
</I>&gt;<i> necessary for Core or should go into Add-in? 
</I>
This could also be implemented in MD.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Tips for bracket start: For this I'm not sure if it's a trivial thing
</I>&gt;<i> and might need upstream changes for text editor widget, but as PHP Codes
</I>&gt;<i> might go very long, it's easy to lost track of what closing brackets
</I>&gt;<i> closes. Like, if you're closing a function, on the closing bracket it
</I>&gt;<i> would be really helpful to show (on the top of editor) starting line of
</I>&gt;<i> that block. (ie. you started a function foo (bar) { ... and on closing
</I>&gt;<i> bracket of that function, not only it highlight the openning bracket,
</I>&gt;<i> but also showing &quot;function foo (bar..)&quot; on top of the editor. (Zend PHP
</I>&gt;<i> IDE has such a feature for example). That can also be useful for C#
</I>&gt;<i> coding and other languages as well. or can it? Is that *only* useful for
</I>&gt;<i> PHP?
</I>
This could also be an option in the text editor.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Directory tree: Browsing the directories in MD is not very efficient.
</I>&gt;<i> You can't point the sub directory, without changing the current
</I>&gt;<i> directory. A directory tree in new nautilus list view would be really
</I>&gt;<i> helpful, to open sub directories in threaded view and choosing files
</I>&gt;<i> from there. That might even reported as bug, have to admit that I
</I>&gt;<i> haven't checked it. C# codes might need it, but big PHP projects
</I>&gt;<i> definately need that. Because you mostly need to work with parallel in
</I>&gt;<i> one directory you keep HTML Templates, and in one directory you keep
</I>&gt;<i> sctipts, and you need to switch between them very often. For that reason
</I>&gt;<i> do you think that it's just a PHP necessity or should go into Core? 
</I>
I'm wondering if you should use the solution view instead of the file
view. That is, if all those template and scripts belong to a project,
won't they be in the project directory?

Lluis.
