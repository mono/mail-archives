<PRE>Hi All

 

So I know that back in July there was a discussion on the mailing list about
a new logo. Salvatore provided a good base design and with help and comments
from everybody he tweaked the font size, color palette (tango) etc. I think
everybody agreed that they liked the design, but the one thing people did
not agree on was the color combinations used in the design.

 

Here is a link that Lluis posted previously, displaying the 3 different
options at the time.

At the time of the discussion I was all for number 2, but now that I have
not looked at it for a while I don't know anymore. I do like the logo and
think is the best that has been proposed so far, but I don't know about any
of the color combinations provided so far. Ultimately the colors of the
final logo will be used for branding on website, splash screen etc. The idea
is to only use the colors on the Tango pallete, here is the link

How about creating a competition for the best color schema where logo's have
to be submitted by a certain date and let the community vote for the logo
they like the best?
