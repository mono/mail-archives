<PRE>Hello,

The whole &quot;Load up Main.sln and hit F5&quot; doesn't work (for me at least
from SVN HEAD and Visual Studio 2008) and here is a patch to fix that.

Firstly it took me a while to figure out that the &quot;Debug&quot;
configuration is actually a DebugLinux configuration and that there is
a Win32 one. So the first thing that the attached patch does is to
rename Debug to DebugLinux. (Building with the DebugLinux
configuration fails because it tries to build GnomePlatform and is
missing the Gnome assemblies.)

Next the DebugWin32 configuration had zero projects included for
compilations. So the next thing that this patch does is to enable all
the projects to build except Gnome/MacPlatform and Moonlight.

Next the Startup project was set to MonoDevelop.Core which is a
library. The patch sets it to MonoDevelop.Startup.

That's it. Please review and if it's okay commit.

One more pending issue is that the VS solution is trying to load
po.mdproj which gives an error in Visual Studio BTW. Can't this
project be converted to VS project format too?


Kind Regards,

Ivan Zlatev
