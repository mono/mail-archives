Yes, I really hope MWF gets some love soon :)

VS or SD do not work under wine yet, i've tried with the latest
crossover office too. I suspect that they both require too much in the
way of kernel based services for them ever to work on wine or mono.

&gt;<i> I also thought about trying to get SharpDevelop to run on Mono. Perhaps

</I>
SD probably will never run on mono, it uses too many p-invoke calls,
plus for forms layout it uses the designers built into .net, mono doesnt
have these yet.

&gt;<i> Anyway, I guess it's going to be all about the mwf-designer if and when

</I>
I did recently find an old release of x-develop (2.0) , it is a java
based IDE but has c# support targeting mono and windows, it has a gui
designer that seems to work for winforms and gtk. but it is commercial
and quite strange to use. The most recent incarnation of it has
dropped .net as a target too.

I think part of our problem is that gtk# is so much nicer to develop for
than winforms ;)
