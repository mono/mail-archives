<PRE>
This does not answer the earlier nunit question, but it's a related 
question I have...

I downloaded NUnit for .net 2.0 binary file (dll) - version 2.4.8.0 (had 
to dig around nunit's website to find the download), then ran gacutil -i 
nunit.core.dll and gacutil -i nunit.framework.dll to install them in the 
global assembly cache..  That much seemed to work ok (no errors)...  I 
needed this to build another project I'm trying that i didn't write...

Then I set my project type in monodevelop to .net 2.0 ..

Then I went to edit references....

But even though I registered the nunit .net 2.0 v2.4.8.0 files, 
nunit.core and nunit.framework were not listed under 'all' in 
monodevelop v2.8.6.3 if i set project type to mono/.net 2.0...

At first I thought this was an ubuntu issue, so i asked at 
ubuntuforums.org programmer forum.   But now i'm not so sure it's not a 
monodevelop issue.  Or if i'm the issue (most likely) in that i'm doing 
something wrong.

BTW, Thanks for the earlier pointers on my question about cross-platform 
issues.  I received at least one answer which worked well enough, and 
the other answer got me further along my path.

-Rob

p.s. If you're wondering, i'm trying to play with the source to 
f-spot..  I can build it now from the command line with make and it runs 
fine, but with monodevelop (it comes with a .sln file and a README on 
what to do beforehand) I get the nunit errors when i try to build from 
within..
