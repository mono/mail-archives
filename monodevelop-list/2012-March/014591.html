Most likely this isn't an issue with detecting/loading UTF16, but
rather with *displaying* it. There was a longstanding bug in Pango,
the text rendering library used by MonoDevelop, that caused it not to
handle font fallbacks - i.e. if the main font didn't contain the glyph
for a given character, it wasn't able to fall back to another font for
that glyph. It's often possible to work around this by changing the
text editor font to one that has glyphs for all the characters you
care about.

The *Mono* 2.10.9 beta contains a new version of Pango (among other
things) that supports font fallbacks on Mac - I suggest you try that.
