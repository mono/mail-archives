<PRE>Michael - 

Many thanks for your reply, unfortunately, I am still having issues.   I changed the font display for the entire project to a UTF-16 font (AppleGothic) and my characters appeared just fine.   

So far so good.  Now, the next step was to display my characters on the iPad.  I verified that AppleGothic is a standard iPad font.  My objective is to overlay my UTF-16 characters onto an image.  I create the UIGraphics context, perform a &quot;SelectFont&quot; using &quot;AppleGothic&quot;, a point size and with CGTextEncoding set to &quot;FontSpecific&quot;  I see nothing.   Obviously, my characters exist in that font, as I can now see them in the code window.  When I change the encoding to the incorrect &quot;MacRoman&quot;, I see little boxes where my characters should be.


What do I need to do to ensure that UTF-16 characters are displayed as part of a UIGraphics object?

</I>&gt;<i> that glyph. It's often possible to work around this by changing the
</I>&gt;<i> text editor font to one that has glyphs for all the characters you

</I>&gt;<i> The *Mono* 2.10.9 beta contains a new version of Pango (among other
</I>&gt;<i> things) that supports font fallbacks on Mac - I suggest you try that.
