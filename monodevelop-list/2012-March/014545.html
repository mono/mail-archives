<PRE>Hi Rob,

not sure if I can help .. but I will try to give some hints as I try to support all platforms with my Mono Application.

To be able to run it on all systems I have to compile three different variations:
- a .NET 4/Mono CLI 4.0 compile
- a .NET 2/Mono CLI 2.0 compile
- a .NET 2/Mono CLI 2.0 stripped x86 version for Windows support

Due to no easy way of compiling .NET 2/Mono CLI 2.0 on newer Ubuntu systems, I am forced to compile .NET 4/Mono CLI 4.0 instead. Then a VirtualBox Ubuntu Lucid machine takes over the action for compiling a .NET 2/Mono CLI 2.0 variation to be compatible with older systems.

The same machine does the stripped compile for Windows support as well. I have to remove via compiler directives some libnotify stuff, because this does not exist on Windows - but this is not what may correspond to your problem because it is specific to my application.

But it is important to compile for x86 platform for Windows as well, because of GTK#! (no shebang meant here *lol*)
And I have to choose .NET 2/Mono CLI 2.0 for Windows as well, because a .NET 4 variant does not work for I don't know why reasons, maybe GTK# as well...

Here on my main development system (Linux Mint 12 - based on Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric) I work with Monodevelop 2.6 but on my VirtualBox Lucid compile machine Monodevelop 2.8.5 is installed, because luckily s. o. backported it for Lucid.

I am underlining this to confirm that .exe binaries compiled with Monodevelop 2.8.5 run without problems on Windows! ... at least under the conditions stated above.

Hope this helps, feel free to investigate my program which you can access via Subversion: <A HREF="svn://server7even.homeip.net/dsota">svn://server7even.homeip.net/dsota</A> (try again one day later if stupid DynDNS hat not updated correctly :D )
Alternatively you can download the binaries and the source code from here: <A HREF="http://www.nskcomputing.de/?section=dsota">http://www.nskcomputing.de/?section=dsota</A>

Regards,
Nicolas

&gt;<i> Hi
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I built a very simple test program in monodevelop (gtk# application)
</I>&gt;<i> which just has a vertical box and a label...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I built it twice actually, once in monodevelop for Windows and once in
</I>&gt;<i> Monodevelop for Linux (Ubuntu)..  Took about a minute and a half to
</I>&gt;<i> figure out the first time i did it, and under 30 seconds the second time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The version i built on Linux Monodevelop will run fine on Linux, but
</I>&gt;<i> when i run it in Windows (version: 8 Consumer Preview), it fails to run
</I>&gt;<i> (i solved the first problem which is that gtk-sharp wasn't installed)--
</I>&gt;<i> It's not that it crashes now, it just doesn't display a window and as
</I>&gt;<i> far as i can tell it dies as quick as it runs with no indication as to why.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But the version i built in Windows Monodevelop (without mono, i believe)
</I>&gt;<i> runs as an .exe in both Windows and Linux (from both systems i can run
</I>&gt;<i> the .exe monodevelop built).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does this mean I have to use Windows to build my project?  Is this an
</I>&gt;<i> issue most likely with monodevelop or more likely is it an issue with
</I>&gt;<i> the mono compiler itself (versus the microsoft compiler, which
</I>&gt;<i> monodevelop in windows probably uses).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, I presume Windows has the gtk# prerequisites now because the gtk#
</I>&gt;<i> app i built in Windows ran fine in Windows.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone here willing to lend a hand?  I am a monodevelop newbie, I have
</I>&gt;<i> an app (for me only, will never see the light of day for anyone else, it
</I>&gt;<i> would be useless) that i wrote in visual studio that i'd like to port to
</I>&gt;<i> mono and gtk# to make it cross platform.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -Rob
