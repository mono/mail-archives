<PRE>I believe this is a &quot;Feature&quot; as it has always been like that (as far as 
I can remember). The MD/Xamarin guys must never commit separate files.

If you do modify multiple files in a directory but only want to commit 
the changes in just one then you have to use the Version Control &gt; 
Review Changes action and untick the files you don't want to commit.

I guess that the idea might be to reduce the likelihood of people 
committing breaking changes by committing just one file when those 
changes rely on changes in other files.
