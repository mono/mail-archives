</I>
It was Style Eclipse (<A HREF="http://studiostyl.es/schemes/style_eclipse">http://studiostyl.es/schemes/style_eclipse</A>). I've 
done lots of Java dev at work and while it isn't the greatest scheme, I 
find it far less eye burning or eye straining than the available 
options. I have hit a few bugs and crashes that I need to report, 
though, so it might be related.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't know if there's room for change (and I think I might have

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well - you can enable and disable colour overrides for certain classes

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hard. Atm I think a simple scheming style is better when adding new
</I>&gt;<i> colors. The color overrides we had caused more harm than good.
</I>
I wasn't thinking of overrides across themes, just within themes. If I 
say my base colour is #000000 instead of the default #444444 then I 
don't want to have to go through every single token that uses #444444 
and set it to black as well.

If I could enable (say) the colouring of strings then I could choose 
whether to have them the default or a custom colour, and if it was the 
default then it'd change as well whenever I changed the base colour.

Similarly, if there was a base &quot;all strings&quot; option and then I could 
enable a custom colour for &quot;C# @ verbatim strings&quot; or disable it and let 
it fall back to the default (which could change and verbatim strings 
would change automatically).

I understand if VS.Net limits what you can do in some areas, but it just 
feels like &quot;specify everything so that you have to change everything&quot; 
isn't the best way to go.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Are MD colour schemes going to be sharable and re-usable? I'd be more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than happy to share my colour scheme once it is done, but as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> studiostyl.es is for VS.Net then I can't share it with others there.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes why not ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The blog post seemed to imply that import wasn't stable yet. Also, 
someone needs to set up a site to host them, I guess, since StudioStyles 
is MS-centric.
