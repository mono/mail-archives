<PRE>Hi,

I'm not sure if this is just my setup or a bug in Xam Studio 4.0.4 so 
I'll throw it open here before I put it onto BZ.

I've a number of projects under svn control, two of which are under 
active development. While I can commit the content of directory by 
selecting the directory and selecting to commit (right click, version 
control, commit), if I do the same with a single file, I can't commit.

I can't see anything obvious in the settings for this.

Any suggestions on if this is a bug or if this is just down to one of my 
settings?
