</I>
I think it mis-named it (just gave it the default name) and wouldn't let 
me select it. I had tried to import an old MD theme first and had a few 
other problems with the profile, so I've deleted the profile directory 
since then.

&gt;&gt;<i> I wasn't thinking of overrides across themes, just within themes. If I

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't want to have to go through every single token that uses #444444
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and set it to black as well.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is fallback to &quot;Plain Text&quot; - but to plain text only.
</I>
Either I did something out of order, or it wasn't obvious then. I 
created a new theme (based on the MD default) and I had to change 
everything from #444444 to #000000.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If I could enable (say) the colouring of strings then I could choose
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whether to have them the default or a custom colour, and if it was the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> default then it'd change as well whenever I changed the base colour.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Similarly, if there was a base &quot;all strings&quot; option and then I could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enable a custom colour for &quot;C# @ verbatim strings&quot; or disable it and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> let it fall back to the default (which could change and verbatim
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> strings would change automatically).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I understand if VS.Net limits what you can do in some areas, but it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just feels like &quot;specify everything so that you have to change
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everything&quot; isn't the best way to go.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But it's easier to add new colors - because I can't break the fallback
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism.
</I>
As long as all of the colours were added as leaf nodes (i.e. always 
inheriting from Plain Text or from a current leaf node) then I wouldn't 
expect the fallback to break. If you inserted something in the middle of 
an inheritance hierarchy then you'd get different behaviour before and 
after the addition, but that's different.
