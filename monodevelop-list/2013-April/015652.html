<PRE>I gave up and recreated the theme from scratch in the end, which was 
annoying. I also noticed the &quot;no inheritance&quot; behaviour, which was also 
awkward as it means you're repeating the same settings a lot.

I actually tried one of the studiostyl.es colour schemes as well (one 
that didn't either burn or strain my eyes, which is surprisingly tricky 
to find!) but it didn't seem to import correctly.

I don't know if there's room for change (and I think I might have 
mentioned this before) but I think Eclipse do the colour system quite 
well - you can enable and disable colour overrides for certain classes 
of token and if you disable it then it'll fall back to the default.

Are MD colour schemes going to be sharable and re-usable? I'd be more 
than happy to share my colour scheme once it is done, but as 
studiostyl.es is for VS.Net then I can't share it with others there.
