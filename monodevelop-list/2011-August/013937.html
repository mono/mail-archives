<PRE>
1. I installed mono-2.10.4-gtksharp-2.12.11-win32-0.exe.2. I wanted to install MonoDevelop-2.6.rc1.msi but it said that I don't have gtksharp &gt; 2.12.9 installed. I didn't understand because I installed gtksharp-2.12.11 within mono-2.10.4-gtksharp-2.12.11-win32-0.exe or not? Well, I didn't mind.
3. I installed gtk-sharp-2.12.10.win32.msi and then MonoDevelop-2.6.rc1.msi worked without error.
4. Run Monodevelop
5. Loaded my C# GTK application and compiled it - everything went well.
6. Changed &quot;Default Runtime (MS.Net 4.0)&quot; to &quot;Mono 2.10.4&quot; and compiled it. I got several errors that gtk cannot be found and references &quot;atk-sharp&quot;,&#160; &quot;gdk-sharp&quot;, &quot;glade-sharp&quot;,&#160; &quot;glib-sharp&quot;,&#160; &quot;gtk-sharp&quot;,&#160; &quot;pango-sharp&quot; became red.
7. Don't understand why and how I can fix it.
&#160;
Can you help me please?
