<PRE>Hi,

To show process output in the integrated console all you have to do is to call the method OnTargetOutput in the GdbSession class when you get some output through the tty.

&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm still working on it, actually I face some problems:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At this time, i have a class that is an abstraction of a pair of tty instances (master and slave). That works just fine!
</I>&gt;<i> But I'm not sure about what i could do using it from a plugin for MD: because I guess that I would need to intercept and redirect a lot of streams and events, and don't think that it's possible at the moment: indeed, i have read the MD source code and found some &quot;input access&quot; from the class LogViewProgressMonitor : 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> NotSupportedTextReader inputReader = new NotSupportedTextReader ();
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I guess some support for input was planned, but it seems I cannot access to this member and replace it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, I already began to work patching the MD source codes themselves (got from SVN), and get some good results yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I would want to know is, Could I really do it as a plugin, or should I make a patch anyway ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2011/8/3 Charles &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monodevelop-list">charles.dmt at gmail.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I recently discovered MD 2.6 (under linux) after using the previous version for a while, and I noted that on debugging C/C++ code using GDB, MD was unable to capture the output of the code into the integrated console. After discussions and investigation, I learnt this integrated console was not a real console but only a text control linked with stdout. The problem is, GDM does not seem to have an option to redirect its output into a file (such like stdout) using the MI2 mode.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I found that it would be nice to make MD provides a real integrated virtual console, so it can manage the input is the program ask for it, and the output can be displayed inside anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So how do i see that ? The idea i to use some /dev/pts special files in order to develop a basic virtual terminal interface into a plugin. As a first goal, I should be able to use a &quot;background&quot; virtual tty that would only redirect its content into the actual console.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I start to work on it from that day, and hope to have some suit.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards,
</I>&gt;<i> unomadh
