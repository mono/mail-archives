<PRE>Yep, there was &quot;Require Specific Version&quot; checked on those libraries. I unchecked all, but it didn't help. I tried to remove one library (&quot;gtk-sharp&quot;) and added it again from GAC but found out that it is not possible to choose it from GAC list.
So perhaps they are not installed in Mono GAC and were installed to .Net Fw 4.0 GAC. When I choose &quot;Default Runtime&quot; or &quot;Microsoft.Net&quot; in Active Configuration drop down box and recompile the project, it finds all libraries without any problem. But if I choose &quot;Mono 2.10.4 (C:Program Files (x86)Mono-2.10.4)&quot;, all previously mentioned libraries become red in References list.
&#160;
How I can install GTK libraries to Mono GAC and why it is not handled by Mono installer (mono-2.10.4-gtksharp-2.12.11-win32-0.exe)?

</I>Perhaps your solution has been set to require exact versions of those libraries and you don't have exactly the version it wants.
You can test this theory by editing your references and seeing if 'require specific version' is enabled or not.
