<PRE>I have written a program that asks two questions for input (in the terminal)
and then executes according to the values provided.

(I am running the latest version of Linux Mint, and the latest monodevelop)
However, the first line that I have for input, much of the time the first
characters I type do not display. So, if I am trying to give my file
location, as /home/xxx...
It will display as &quot;ome/xxx...&quot; or &quot;home/xxx...&quot; and sometimes will display
all characters typed. 
However, when I ask it to print the line back to the terminal so I can see
what I typed in, the characters that were missing WERE recognized by the
system. 

So I wind up thinking I didn't hit the key, but then if I edit to fix that I
wind up with the computer having read the missing characters, so it thinks
I'm trying to go to //home or /h/home...

This doesn't seem to happen with anything else that uses the terminal, only
this program (which is the only I've written in monodevelop and why I
thought it might be a monodevelop issue).

Has anyone seen this? Is there any way to deal with it, or just trust my
keystrokes? It definitely limits my ability to share the program with anyone
else...
