<PRE>Hello,

I'm still working on it, actually I face some problems:

At this time, i have a class that is an abstraction of a pair of tty
instances (master and slave). That works just fine!
But I'm not sure about what i could do using it from a plugin for MD:
because I guess that I would need to intercept and redirect a lot of streams
and events, and don't think that it's possible at the moment: indeed, i have
read the MD source code and found some &quot;input access&quot; from the class
LogViewProgressMonitor :

NotSupportedTextReader inputReader = new NotSupportedTextReader ();

So I guess some support for input was planned, but it seems I cannot access
to this member and replace it.


So, I already began to work patching the MD source codes themselves (got
from SVN), and get some good results yet.

What I would want to know is, Could I really do it as a plugin, or should I
make a patch anyway ?

&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I recently discovered MD 2.6 (under linux) after using the previous version
</I>&gt;<i> for a while, and I noted that on debugging C/C++ code using GDB, MD was
</I>&gt;<i> unable to capture the output of the code into the integrated console. After
</I>&gt;<i> discussions and investigation, I learnt this integrated console was not a
</I>&gt;<i> real console but only a text control linked with stdout. The problem is, GDM
</I>&gt;<i> does not seem to have an option to redirect its output into a file (such
</I>&gt;<i> like stdout) using the MI2 mode.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I found that it would be nice to make MD provides a real integrated
</I>&gt;<i> virtual console, so it can manage the input is the program ask for it, and
</I>&gt;<i> the output can be displayed inside anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So how do i see that ? The idea i to use some /dev/pts special files in
</I>&gt;<i> order to develop a basic virtual terminal interface into a plugin. As a
</I>&gt;<i> first goal, I should be able to use a &quot;background&quot; virtual tty that would
</I>&gt;<i> only redirect its content into the actual console.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I start to work on it from that day, and hope to have some suit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards,
</I>&gt;<i> unomadh
</I>&gt;<i>
