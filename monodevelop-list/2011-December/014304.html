</I>This is how it is done right now, having several sln files, but that 
means that someone
needs to maintain them. OK. it is not big problem, but I wrote nice-to-have.
It is clear that Monodevelop tries to mimic VS as much as possible, 
because of targeted
&quot;audience&quot;.

  * If right click + Run/Debug on the project launches ok and this
    project is set as
    startup project , why is f5 (run/debug) fails?!?!
    This is common question... Not mine...
  * I think that suggestion for nice-to-have to Microsoft would take
    couple of
    days longer than what took You to answer. Trying to explain to VS
    team that
    errors popup big in red into our faces, but I have to look down left
    into Status
    Bar to see that &quot;Build succeeded&quot; is not much of UX.
    I'm talking about VS newbies (have couple of students and school
    kids eager
    to learn) that are a bit confused.


This was just suggestion...

thanks for Your time...

regards

mel
