[MonoDevelop] Error compiling gtksourceview

</bold>

Thanks Mark.


Does anyone know where to get a pre-built binary for RH9 of GTK 2.3.0
or newer?  I can get source from gtk.org, but I fear that in trying to
compile that, I will be headed down yet another garden path of
dependency conflicts and tangents.


Secondly, might the MonoDevelop team consider adding some instructions
to the web site that includes a discussion about what the dependencies
are, and where to get them?  Perhaps the problem I'm hitting here is
just the first of many, many dependency conflicts.


Lastly, all I'm really looking for is a pre-build binary of
MonoDevelop for RH9.  There isn't one on the Mono project web site,
despite claims to the contrary on the MonoDevelop site.  Does anyone
know of a good source?


Thanks.

<excerpt>Kevin,


The clue is there in the info you posted.  The install program is
saying that although you have GTK2 installed, you have GTK 2.2.1
whereas GTKSourceView requires GTK 2.3.0 or newer.


Upgrading your GTK2 to the latest version should fix this.


If you believe you already have got a more recent version of GTK2
installed, then check where you have installed it, and that you've
removed any older versions from your system.  Somewhere on your system
will be pkgconfig files (with a suffix of .pc if I remember rightly)
and by finding out where the .pc files are located and looking at the
.pc file for GTK2, you can find out what version the system thinks it
has installed.


Also make sure that wherever you've installed GTK2 is included in the
system path.  (If you're setting --prefix=/usr then  /usr should
almost definitely be included in the system path)


I hope this helps,


Mark

For GtkSourceView, when I do the ./configure --prefix=/usr, I get ...

checking for gtk+-2.0 >= 2.3.0

        libxml-2.0 >= 2.5.0

        libgnomeprint-2.2 >= 2.2.0... Requested 'gtk+-2.0 >= 2.3.0'
but version of GTK+ is 2.2.1


configure: error: Library requirements (gtk+-2.0 >= 2.3.0

        libxml-2.0 >= 2.5.0

        libgnomeprint-2.2 >= 2.2.0) not met; consider adjusting the
PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if your libraries are in a
nonstandard prefix so pkg-config can find them.


I don't know what to do to get past this.  Suggestions?  I don't mean
to complain, but is there a better set of installation notes somewhere?


Thanks.
