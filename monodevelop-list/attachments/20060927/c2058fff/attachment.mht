Good catch.

Ideally I think it should create a set of autotools scripts that
basically do nothing.  That is, nothing is really checked for during
configure, make has nothing to make, etc.

As for your other proposed fixes, we also need to keep in mind that the
autotools files are generated when a solution is deployed to a tarball.
So we would need to disable that too.  All of this gets kind of messy so
I think the best solution is that the autotools addin needs to be fixed
to handle these circumstances.

&gt; Hi
&gt; 
&gt; What should be the behaviour of generating autotools files on empty
&gt; solutions?
&gt; 
&gt; I wanted to create autotools files on a newly created empty solution and
&gt; a NullReference exception happened. Well, the bug is easy to fix - only
&gt; a null check is required, but I don't think this would be desired
&gt; behaviour - just failing silently I mean :D
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I guess autotools on empty solutions don't make much sense so
&gt; should be the button disabled if the solution has no active
&gt; configuration?
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I've attached a patch that pops a friendlier message box up when
&gt; an active configuration doesn't exist - I don't know if the message is
&gt; correct (is it possible that non-empty solutions don't have an active
&gt; configuration?).
&gt; 
&gt; Is it OK to commit the patch?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Enjoy
