Hi,

Your problem is not related to generics.  You have non-code files in
your solution which are flagged to be compiled.

&gt;From what I can see, this includes some xml config files, a readme.txt,
and an App.Config.  I am not sure why MonoDevelop builds these projects
successfully, but you need to unflag these files for autotools.

I think what you want to do is flag them for deployment.  This is
something Lluis did which is pretty cool.  This will deploy these files
to the install directory (i.e. .../lib/myapp/ )

To do this, right click on the files in the solution pad, and select
'Deploy' from the 'Include' submenu.  This will uncheck the 'Build'
option.  For files that you don't want to deploy (maybe readme.txt) just
uncheck the 'Build' option.

I had to commit a small fix for the exe wrapper, but after that your app
deployed, built, and ran fine.

let me know if there are any more problems,
Scott

&gt; &gt; &gt; target configured for the solution (which I recreated once I was in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the newest MD instance), which contains two projects; both of which
&gt; &gt; &gt; are configured to use the 2.0 runtime.  Like I said, the solution
&gt; &gt; &gt; builds and runs fine in MD, and I've also built an installer for
&gt; &gt; &gt; Windows (using Innosetup) that runs fine as well.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;     I went into the
&gt; &gt; &gt; monodevelop/Extras/CSharpBinding/Autotools/CSharpAutotoolsSetup.cs
&gt; &gt; &gt; file, and confirmed the check for 2.0 runtime was there, and it was,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but running make still makes it apparent that it's not in fact
&gt; &gt; &gt; targeting the 2.0 runtime.  Not sure what to do at this point . . .

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'd forgotten about this, but it appears Lluis added this functionality
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about a month ago:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://svn.myrealbox.com/viewcvs/trunk/monodevelop/Extras/CSharpBinding/Autotools/CSharpAutotoolsSetup.cs?rev=62683&amp;r1=61764&amp;r2=62683
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was able to create a test solution which uses Generics, generate
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; autotools, and build with make successfully.  Make sure you are using an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; updated SVN and that you have set your project to the 2.0 runtime.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     I added a tarball deployment target to a project I built in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MD.  ./configure runs fine, but make fails with a parsing error (due
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to generics).  The project targets the 2.0 runtime (and compiles and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; runs fine in MD), but the tarball doesn't seem to be configured to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; compile against the 2.0 runtime.  What am I missing?
