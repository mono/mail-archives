I don't really get this. It's complaining it can't find
libsvn_client-1.so.0 which does exist on my system and is confirmed by
the following output:

james@athos:~$ ldconfig -p | grep libsvn_client
        libsvn_client-1.so.0 (libc6,x86-64)
=3D&gt; /usr/lib/libsvn_client-1.so.0
        libsvn_client-1.so (libc6,x86-64) =3D&gt; /usr/lib/libsvn_client-1.so
james@athos:~$=20


The LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the Makefile I am using when I &quot;make run&quot;
monodevelop includes /usr/lib.=20

Why am I still getting=20
 System.DllNotFoundException: libsvn_client-1.so.0

Any help would be appreciated!
James

&gt; &gt; Hi all,

&gt; &gt; I've just upgraded my version of svn to 1.4.3 (built from source on
&gt; &gt; ubuntu Edgy as repository version is only 1.3.2), and am getting the
&gt; &gt; following error in the console when I run monodevelop:
&gt;=20
&gt; Sadly, it seems Debian-based systems have arbitrarily bumped the .so
&gt; number on libsvn_client-1.so.0 to libsvn_client-1.so.1

&gt; I would *guess* that they did this so that you could have both 1.3.x and
&gt; 1.4.x installed in parallel, but I'd only be guessing. None of the other
&gt; distros do this and if you compile 1.4.x yourself, it will be named
&gt; libsvn_client-1.so.0 just like the 1.3.x .deb versions are named.

&gt; We haven't yet figured out what to do about this in MonoDevelop...
