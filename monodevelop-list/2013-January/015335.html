<PRE>Hi Robbie,

</I>

That's because there was never a MonoDevelop-2.10.8

The last version of MonoDevelop released before 3.0 was 2.8.6.5.

Don't confuse the Mono version (of which you might need 2.10.8) with the
MonoDevelop version that you probably want (2.8.6.5).

The MonoDevelop 3.x versions we've released so far are:

MonoDevelop-3.0.dmg
MonoDevelop-3.0.1.dmg
MonoDevelop-3.0.2.dmg
MonoDevelop-3.0.3.dmg
MonoDevelop-3.0.4.dmg
MonoDevelop-3.0.5.dmg
MonoDevelop-3.0.6.dmg


I provided you with a link where you can find all of the Mono 2.10.9
releases. Give them a try first. If they work, great - if not, just replace
2.10.9 in the url I gave you with 2.10.8

</I>&gt;<i> Do you know of a working link to download v2.10.8? Perhaps I'm guessing
</I>&gt;<i> wrong. Or, do you have a copy of the .dmg you can put up on an FTP server I
</I>&gt;<i> can get to?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Upgrading my MacOS version isn't really an option at this point in time. I
</I>&gt;<i> want to have a better understanding of MonoDevelop's capabilities before I
</I>&gt;<i> go through the expense and trouble.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It's probably worth the $30 to upgrade regardless :-)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just as important, I'd like to develop software that can run on older Macs.
</I>&gt;<i> Will the software written with MonoDevelop on OSX 10.6, for example, run on

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You can target Mac OS X 10.6, I don't know if it'll work on older versions
or not. Realistically, you'll still want MonoDevelop 3.1.1 or newer in
order to take advantage of all of the functionality that has been
added/improved for writing Mac OS applications.

Not that you can't do things the hard way with older versions of
MonoDevelop, but you'll never be able to target the App Store nor
distribute your apps to Mountain Lion users (Mountain Lion requires that
apps be signed which can only be done if you, the developer, is using 10.7
or newer).
