<PRE>Hello,
I have not been able to find instructions on how to create a working
executable, either for Windows or Mac. This is probably so obvious no one's
thought to document it. However, as a newbie, I haven't been able to figure
it out. BTW: I have not used Visual Studio, so I don't know how to do this
there, either.
Here's what I've done:
I downloaded sample code and made it run in within Monodevelop. It works on
both Windows and Mac.
Set the Active Configuration to &quot;Release|x86&quot;. (Note: On a Macintosh, the
only options are &quot;Debug|x86&quot; and &quot;Release|x86&quot;. Are there ways to add a Mac
option?) 
I see in the project\bin\Release folder, I do see an .exe file.
When I try to run the .exe file on Windows, I get the following error
message: &quot;This application has failed to start because MSVCR90.dll was not
found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.&quot;
I presume that this is not the correct executable because of the above
error.
Of course I cannot run an .exe on a Macintosh because it is a Windows
executable.
So, can someone point me in the direction of instructions for creating a
working .exe on Windows and a working .app on a Mac, please? Or let me know
the mistake I'm making here?
FYI: I am running MonoDevelop v. 3.0.6 on Windows XP SP3 (32 bit), and
MonoDevelop v. 2.8.6.5 on Mac OSX 10.5.8 on a 1.5 GHz Intel Core Solo Mac
Mini. GTK# 12.2.0.0 is installed on both, .Net Framework 4.0 is installed on
Windows, Mono Framework MDK 2.10.10 is installed on the Mac. (Yes, I know
there's a later version of MonoDevelop for Mac, however it requires two OS
upgrades which require an iTunes upgrade which may possibly require a later
computer than I have. I'd prefer to make sure that MonoDevelop even works
before investing a lot of time and expense on aspects that appear
peripheral.)
Thank You In Advance!
Robbie
