The FC 17 mono isn't on the system - I removed it to guard against this
exact problem.  I forgot to mention that I set PKG_CONFIG_PATH to the
parallel mono install location to ensure the correct .pc files are
picked up.  It could still be something along those lines but since
removing FC17 mono I did rebuild all sources specifying --prefix.

Having read the parallel environment link, I realise that I am not
setting:  ACLOCAL_PATH  .  Surely LD_LIBRARY_PATH not being set would
cause an earlier failure upon execution of the locally built mono tools
rather than the failure to compile generated sources as I'm seeing.

I guess I can go back and use the script as supplied on the page and
rebuild everything again but to me it looks like there might be an
inconsistency between my installed system gnome development library and
what the gnome-sharp project expects (specified as version x.x.x &gt;= n ,
but the later version I have is incompatible?) ...

Thanks for pointing out the parallel mono env link regardless.

Jeremy
