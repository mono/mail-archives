<PRE>Hello

i'm testint asp.net on md 0.13.1.

I experience some problems with compliation of 2.0 .NET

MonoDevelop require &quot;protected System.Web...&quot; in codebehind file, which is
absolutly not needed. and xsp2 knows how to diplay without that. For first
test I use example file with codebehind, that is generate when open new
codebehind file. Then i just want to run it, no way, I need to add
declaration into codebehind file, that MD compiles, but works in XSP2.

In additonal i test litle more complex page, there i include auto add
headers to codebehind files, then compiles with MD, but in XSP2 i got double
declaration.

Any idea where might me problem? Shall i report as a bug?

Nice day,
Jan
