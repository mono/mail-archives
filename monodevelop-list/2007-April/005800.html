<PRE>Here is a patch with the code I've hacked at so far. MD gets its  
splash up and then hangs.

&gt;&gt;<i> MD is currently pretty tightly coupled to gtk#, so having a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cocoa# front end will make for some interesting re-factors.  I'd  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> love to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> help you with it, though, so please let us see the code that you've
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> developed so far.
</I>
&gt;<i> any patches to improve the separaration
</I>&gt;<i> cleanly would be much-appreciated.
</I>
I will try to help separate the gui-dependent code from the gui- 
independent code as much as possible as I go through. However I am so  
unfamiliar with the structure of MD that I am very hesitant to change  
more than a few lines of code here and there.

At this point, I have just commented out the Gtk code and swapped in  
the equivalent Cocoa# code. I guess there should be a configure  
switch and preprocessor directives to select between Gtk and cocoa?  
Or perhaps there is a better way?

Alex

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, Lluis has already done a lot of work to split out the GUI

</I>&gt;<i> MD can be used as a command-line tool without depending on GTK#. The
</I>&gt;<i> problem is that a *lot* of the IDE is necessarily GUI-dependent, and
</I>&gt;<i> there are limits to how much you can split out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> See <A HREF="http://www.monodevelop.com/Architecture_Overview">http://www.monodevelop.com/Architecture_Overview</A> for info about
</I>&gt;<i> the architecture: MonoDevelop.Core and MonoDevelop.Projects should be
</I>&gt;<i> able to be used unmodified. Apart from that, huge chunks will need to
</I>&gt;<i> be rewitten to make it natively Cocoa#. IMO it's important to avoid
</I>&gt;<i> forking as far as possible, so any patches to improve the separaration
