ok, sounds reasonable.
though you will probably have to wait about a week until i can provide
the updated patch since i have a couple of exams coming up next week.

&gt;<i> creating snapshots is something specific to heap-shot
</I>the IProfilerSnapshot interface is used to describe a file generated
by the profiler, maybe a poor choice of name, but that is something
all profilers share.
the CreateSnapshot method simply means &quot;tell the current profiler we
need a file describing the current state of the application&quot;. it does
not matter if the profiler supports taking multiple snapshots, for
example: when implementing a profiler that requires the application to
quit before being able to produce a &quot;snapshot&quot;, the CreateSnapshot
method would simply do the same thing as .Stop()

&gt;<i> In fact, I'm wondering if the IProfiler interface is really needed.
</I>the main reasons for this interface are:
* the SnapshotCreated event that all profilers share
* the fact that i was thinking outside the current profiler scenarios;
for example:
suppose there is a profiler that very precisely logs every single
detail you can think of between 2 point in time. the starting point
may not be the same as the moment you start the external process
(suppose you want to profile a weird memory problem that only occurs
after 30 minutes, you don't want data of the first 29 minutes messing
up the report), the Start () method will then be used to let the
profiler know it should start collecting data
