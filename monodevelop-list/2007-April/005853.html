Yep, the name is a bit confusing ;-)

&gt;<i> the CreateSnapshot method simply means &quot;tell the current profiler we
</I>&gt;<i> need a file describing the current state of the application&quot;.
</I>
That's also a bit confusing. Most of profilers don't dump the current
state of the application, but a summary of data collected during the
program execution.

&gt;<i> it does
</I>&gt;<i> not matter if the profiler supports taking multiple snapshots, for
</I>&gt;<i> example: when implementing a profiler that requires the application to
</I>&gt;<i> quit before being able to produce a &quot;snapshot&quot;, the CreateSnapshot
</I>&gt;<i> method would simply do the same thing as .Stop()
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In fact, I'm wondering if the IProfiler interface is really needed.
</I>&gt;<i> the main reasons for this interface are:
</I>&gt;<i> * the SnapshotCreated event that all profilers share
</I>&gt;<i> * the fact that i was thinking outside the current profiler scenarios;
</I>&gt;<i> for example:
</I>&gt;<i> suppose there is a profiler that very precisely logs every single
</I>&gt;<i> detail you can think of between 2 point in time. the starting point
</I>&gt;<i> may not be the same as the moment you start the external process
</I>&gt;<i> (suppose you want to profile a weird memory problem that only occurs
</I>&gt;<i> after 30 minutes, you don't want data of the first 29 minutes messing
</I>&gt;<i> up the report), the Start () method will then be used to let the
</I>&gt;<i> profiler know it should start collecting data
</I>
I have a different view about how to support those features, but I think
that your design is also correct, so it's OK to me.

Thanks!
Lluis.
