<PRE>Hey guys,

     For the last few weeks I have been working on porting the SharpDevelop source editor to Gtk (mostly for my own gratification) and finally have a working version.  I used Gtk.DotNet so that none of the drawing functions had to be changed, but I think that it wouldn't be hard to adapt the drawing to Cairo and Pango.

     What are your thoughts on moving to a different source-code editor. Some of the advantages would be 
     1) It's written in C# -- no need for gtksourceview-sharp bindings
     2) It supports features that gtksourceview doesn't -- code folding, etc.


Disadvantages would be:
     1) Seems like a major change to the project.
     2) One more thing to debug, gtksourceview is handled by another team.

and I am sure there are other arguments on both sides.  Anyway, what do you think? Should I continue to pursue this and try to work it into Monodevelop?

Thanks for your input,
Nate
