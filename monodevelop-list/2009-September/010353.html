<PRE>Upon re-reading my request I wanted to clarify what I meant by this:

&gt;<i> However, upon searching for examples of making add-ins, etc, I noticed
</I>&gt;<i> a couple of plugins where people had used less than optimal APIs, etc,
</I>&gt;<i> because they didn't know other ones existed.
</I>
What I meant is that I saw some patches, etc, that had been submitted  
where reviewers had alerted the developer of APIs they could have used  
after the code had already been written. The developer then had to re- 
jig to use these APIs.

I wasn't implying that any committed code was using the wrong APIs, in  
case it read that way.

Thanks,
Brett

</I>&gt;<i> So that I can research what it would take further, can someone point

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Add T4 as a new file type (with a post-selection screen like the MVC

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Run T4 on any .tt files, whenever they are saved (or on a pre-build
</I>&gt;<i> event, before code is compiled).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Add a context-menu option to .tt files that runs T4 on them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Create a &quot;code-behind&quot; style file hanging under any .tt file that
</I>&gt;<i> has been generated. I.e. if test.tt has test.cs as output, it would
</I>&gt;<i> appear hanging beneath test.tt
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me know if any of that doesn't make sense. Superficially it seems
</I>&gt;<i> like a reasonably easy plugin that might let me give back to my
</I>&gt;<i> favourite IDE.
