Hello,

How do I build MonoDevelop on Windows so that it is using the Mono runtime
instead of .NET?  I would like to run the MonoDevelop 2.2 beta on a Windows
2000 box.

You cannot install .NET 3.5 on Windows 2000.  The latest you can get to is
2.0SP1 which is what I have.

The GTK# for .NET installer works great on this platform but the MonoDevelop
beta installer requires .NET 3.5.

The Mono 2.4.2.3 installer for Windows also works great on Windows 2000. 
Now I need to get MonoDevelop working on top of Mono.

I was able to get MonoDevelop 2.2. beta working on .NET 2.0SP1 by doing the
following:

- Install MonoDevelop on a Windows XP box
- Copy the MonoDevelop folder from &quot;Program Files&quot; over to my Windows 2000
box
- Copy System.Core.dll from the Windows XP box into the MonoDevelop folder
on my Windows 2000 box

With this configuration, MonoDevelop runs quite well.  I can even build GTK#
apps on .NET 2.0SP1.  Unfortunately, there are three problems with this
setup:

1) I am probably not allowed to use the Microsoft System.Core.dll in this
way and do not want to

2) If I use the .NET framework, it is only 2.0SP1 and I need 3.5 stuff

3) I cannot seem to build GTK# applications when I tell MonoDevelop to use
the Mono 2.4.2.3 framework

I tried to get around 1) by using the Mono version of System.Core.dll but
MonoDevelop complains about the strong name signing and will not run.  I
cannot seem to install the Mono DLL into the MS.NET GAC for similar reasons. 
Is there a way around this?

Problem 2) is a problem as I want to use 3.5 features including LINQ and
ASP.NET MVC

Issue 3) is probably just something I am doing wrong.  I would write more
about it but this message is already getting wrong.  Basically, if I try to
create a GTK# app in MonoDevelop targeting the Mono framework it says that
it cannot find the GTK# DLLs or that they are not right for the version of
the framework I am running.  If I replace the references with links right to
the GTK# DLLs in the Mono GAC then the project complains that it cannot use
the designer and then compiles fail because of &quot;Build&quot;.  Perhaps there is an
issue with Stetic in MonoDevelop being built for .NET when I try to compile
for Mono.

I imagine that if I could just build MonoDevelop on Mono on this system that
things might just work.  Unfortunately, I cannot even seem to build
HelloWorldGTK# on Mono so I am not sure how to proceed.

Any ideas?
