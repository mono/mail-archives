<PRE>I'm interested to extend the current T4 functionality in MonoDevelop.  
However, upon searching for examples of making add-ins, etc, I noticed  
a couple of plugins where people had used less than optimal APIs, etc,  
because they didn't know other ones existed.

So that I can research what it would take further, can someone point  
me in the correct place that I would hook to do the following:

* Add T4 as a new file type (with a post-selection screen like the MVC  
View one to select a master page)

* Run T4 on any .tt files, whenever they are saved (or on a pre-build  
event, before code is compiled).

* Add a context-menu option to .tt files that runs T4 on them.

* Create a &quot;code-behind&quot; style file hanging under any .tt file that  
has been generated. I.e. if test.tt has test.cs as output, it would  
appear hanging beneath test.tt

Let me know if any of that doesn't make sense. Superficially it seems  
like a reasonably easy plugin that might let me give back to my  
favourite IDE.

Thanks,
Brett
