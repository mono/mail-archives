<PRE>Hello,

How do I build (or just run) MonoDevelop on Windows so that it is using the
Mono runtime instead of .NET?  I would like to run the MonoDevelop 2.2 beta
on a Windows 2000 box.

You cannot install .NET 3.5 on Windows 2000.  The latest you can get to is
2.0SP1 which is what I have.

The GTK# for .NET installer works great on this platform but the MonoDevelop
beta installer requires .NET 3.5.

The Mono 2.4.2.3 installer for Windows also works great on Windows 2000.
 Now I need to get MonoDevelop working on top of Mono.

I was able to get MonoDevelop 2.2. beta working on .NET 2.0SP1 by doing the
following:

- Install MonoDevelop on a Windows XP box
- Copy the MonoDevelop folder from &quot;Program Files&quot; over to my Windows 2000
box
- Copy System.Core.dll from the Windows XP box into the MonoDevelop folder
on my Windows 2000 box

With this configuration, MonoDevelop runs quite well.  I can even build GTK#
apps on .NET 2.0SP1.  Unfortunately, there are three problems with this
setup:

1) I am probably not allowed to use the Microsoft System.Core.dll in this
way and do not want to

2) If I use the .NET framework, it is only 2.0SP1 and I need 3.5 stuff

3) I cannot seem to build GTK# applications when I tell MonoDevelop to use
the Mono 2.4.2.3 framework

I tried to get around 1) by using the Mono version of System.Core.dll but
MonoDevelop complains about the strong name signing and will not run.  I
cannot seem to install the Mono DLL into the MS.NET GAC for similar reasons.
 Is there a way around this?  I also tried just to run MonoDevelop with
&quot;mono monodevelop.exe&quot; at the command-line (without the MS System.Core.dll)
but I got a dialog box saying &quot;** ERROR **: implement type compare for 1b!
aborting...&quot;.  Is there a way to run the .NET 3.5 compiled MonoDevelop on
Mono?

Problem 2) is significant as I want to use 3.5 features including C# 3.0,
LINQ, and ASP.NET MVC.

Issue 3) is probably just something I am doing wrong.  I would write more
about it but this message is already getting long (and I have now created
another post on this topic).  Basically, if I try to create a GTK# app in
MonoDevelop targeting the Mono framework it says that it cannot find the
GTK# DLLs or that they are not right for the version of the framework I am
running.  If I replace the references with links right to the GTK# DLLs in
the Mono GAC then the project complains that it cannot use the designer and
then compiles fail because of &quot;Build&quot;.  Perhaps there is an issue with
Stetic in MonoDevelop being built for .NET when I try to compile for Mono.

I imagine that if I could just build MonoDevelop on Mono on this system that
things might just work.  Unfortunately, I cannot even seem to build
HelloWorldGTK# on Mono so I am not sure how to proceed.

Any ideas?

I tried to post this message earlier to Nabble but I do not think it went
out.  My apologies if this is a repeat for you.
