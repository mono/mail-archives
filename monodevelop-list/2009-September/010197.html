<PRE>Hi

&gt;<i> Not all developers have 28&quot; screens. A 13&quot; Macbook, for example, has
</I>&gt;<i> resolution of 1280x800. I can comfortably display about 120 columns on
</I>&gt;<i> such a screen. My desktop has a 24&quot; screen @ 1920 x 1200 but use a
</I>&gt;<i> fairly large font, so I can only display ~140 columns.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Even if the lines do fit on the screen, it's easier to mentally parse
</I>&gt;<i> an expression that is meaningfully split up over multiple lines.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Yes thats true, but with an artificial limit of X columns you can't
assume that expressions got meaningfully split - they got split in a way
that makes them harder to read. Read again what I've said - we can do it
but is it really a good feature ?

&gt;<i> I personally try to wrap code to *around* 120 chars, which is what the
</I>&gt;<i> MD solutions' column ruler is set to for C# files. I don't use it as a
</I>&gt;<i> hard rule, just a guideline for readability.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Again, try to make an algorithm that improves readability this way -
artificial limits only break long lines in a way that possible don't
make sense - a better approach is to just preserve the user line breaks.

&gt;<i> Case in point: you made formatting changes to code that I wrote
</I>&gt;<i> definitely damaged readability (lines 56 and 277):
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/viewvc/trunk/monodevelop/main/src/addins/MonoDevelop.DesignerSupport/MonoDevelop.DesignerSupport/ClassOutlineTextEditorExtension.cs?r1=132705&amp;r2=141721">http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/viewvc/trunk/monodevelop/main/src/addins/MonoDevelop.DesignerSupport/MonoDevelop.DesignerSupport/ClassOutlineTextEditorExtension.cs?r1=132705&amp;r2=141721</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
That was the on the fly formatter, it was a bit too aggresive in my
working copy but again I think thats more a matter of personal taste. I
can read line 56 much better this way. 
line 56 can be written shorter as:
IDotNetLanguageBinding binding =
LanguageBindingService.GetBindingPerFileName (doc.Name) as
IDotNetLanguageBinding;
(when adding the using using MonoDevelop.Projects;)

Line 277 would maybe better if you just write 

return !outer.IsEmpty &amp;&amp; outer.End &gt; inner.End;

instead of

return ((outer.End.Line &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; outer.End.Line &gt; inner.End.Line) ||
(outer.End.Line == inner.End.Line &amp;&amp; outer.End.Column &gt;
inner.End.Column));

But I just fixed the bug and the auto formatter did format the lines I
didn't see.

I'm currently working on improvinge the on the fly formatter so that the
algorithm is taken for the whole document format, it'll preserve the
user line breaks.

Regards
Mike
