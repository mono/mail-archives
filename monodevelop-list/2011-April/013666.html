<PRE>Hi there,
I've been developing a GTK# application in MonoDevelop for a while now. As
usual, I left MonoDevelop opened overnight (the computer on too) with the
project opened, and when I opened my computer again this morning, the Visual
Designer was not working anymore. 

Details: I can still switch to &quot;Designer&quot; mode and draw widgets, set signals
etc; however, when I compile my project, no change is effective, I even lost
3 signals. Knowing that I haven't done anything from last night last
compilation and this morning re-opening of the project, I'm really puzzled
as to why and how this problem emerged. 

In an attempt to sort the problem, I've quit everything, switched off the
computer and restarted everything, but it didn't work
I've also opened the file containing the GTK# MainWindow definition,
modified it in a text editor (added the event subscriptions by hand) ,
restarted monodevelop, recompiled and the changes I made disappeared

Anyone out there who understand the link between the Visual Designer in
MonoDevelop and the code generated? cheers
