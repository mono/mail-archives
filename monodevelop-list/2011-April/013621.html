<PRE>Some basic info, running windows XP, Mono 2.67, and I started with using
MonoDevelop 2.4.2 but I am now using 2.6 Beta 1.

I'm pretty much a novice with MonoDevelop, C#, and NUnit so the problem is
probably blatantly obvious to others or self inflicted, but the basic jist
of the problem is that I tried creating a TestFixture to test a more complex
class and quickly found that something was wrong.  Namely I was getting the
below warning and the tests weren't running.

Warning: Reference 'nunit.framework' not found on system. Using
'nunit.framework, Version=2.4.8.0, Culture=neutral,
PublicKeyToken=96d09a1eb7f44a77' instead.

Not thinking I immediately figured &quot;Oh a reference problem!  I guess I just
have to download NUnit!&quot; so I did that and more problems ensued which
essentially led me to uninstalling NUnit, Mono, and MonoDevelop.  I then
reinstalled mono and MonoDevelop but still couldn't get my test class in my
original project to work, so I decided to scrap trying to do that in that
solution and created a new solution and new project with one class simply to
test if I maybe it was just that specific project or solution that was
messing up NUnit.  The class is below.

using NUnit.Framework;
using System;

namespace MapMakerTests
{
	[TestFixture()]
	public class Test
	{
		[Test()]
		public void TestCase ()
		{
			Assert.IsTrue(1 + 1 == 2);
		}
	}
}

Again I had the reference warning, so I tried uninstalling mono and
MonoDevelop once more and this time reinstalled with MonoDevelop 2.6 beta 1
thinking it might compensate for whatever the heck I'm doing wrong, after
which I created a new solution and a new NUnit TestFixture class and same
warning, same problem.

I have noticed that the warning mentions the exact same NUnit package that
is contained in the edit preferences menu item (which is selected) and
despite having the warning it still autocompletes and it seems to recognize
Test and TestFixture.  Not sure why there are () after Test and TestFixture
beyond that they were auto generated like that though removing them does
nothing.  However, I am at a complete loss how to proceed any further.

Any help as to how to fix this problem is welcome.
