<PRE>Hello

I have a monotouch question and wonder if someone can help.  Say I have a view that has two text input fields textfield1, textfield2.  And lets say I modify one of them textfield2 to become a uipicker type input field by textfield2.ResignFirstResponder().  

So now if the users finger tap into textfield1, the old normal keyboard will shows up.   However if he tap into textfield2, a uipicker shows up with the spinning wheel allowing him to select from a list.  So far so good. 

But there is a big problem that I discover.   Suppose he starts off by taping textfield1 and the keyboard comes up, but not he changes his mind and wants to edit the other one so he tap into textfield2, the uipicker comes up.  But!!  The keyboard is still there.   There has to be a way to programmatically turns off the keyboard of textfield1 when you are in the delegate of textfield2.  From the delegate of textfield2 I tried to invoke the ResignFirstResponder() of textfield1 but it does not work, you have to be inside delegate of textfield1  to do it.

Surely someone else must have came across this problem.  Can you share some technique/sample codes on how to resolve this?  Thanks
