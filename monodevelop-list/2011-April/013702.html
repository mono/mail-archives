<PRE>I don't disagree that it is a great thing that MonoDevelop &quot;CAN&quot; run with
.Net but to be &quot;REQUIRED&quot; to use it is what I am complaining about. 

Also .Net 4 is not everywhere and doesn't come installed on any Windows out
of the box. It has to be downloaded to do this, and it is optional in
Windows Update so not being forced upon. .Net 3.5 is on Vista and higher.  

However I am trying to setup an Mono build and development environment on XP
SP3. I choose XP SP3 to intentionally make sure there was no Microsoft .Net
version of any kind so that I can insure that all that I do only is working
with mono and that there are no accidental usage of .Net.

I am not sure WHY there is a requirement for .Net 4 when Mono 2.10 is not
fully .Net 4 compliment, seems like .Net 3.5 should be the minimum
requirement from .net point of view, with Mono being allowed to run against.

So just for fun I installed MonoDevelop 2.6 beta 2 without any .Net to see
how enforced this requirement is.

Well it not only requires GTK# it requires the one that requires .Net 2.0
not the one that is installed with Mono 2.10.  So you cannot install
MonoDevelop 2.6 beta 2 without having .Net installed.

The point is that no mono projects should have a &quot;REQUIRED&quot; dependency on
any version of .Net. Otherwise what is the point of Mono itself if .Net is
required to use it.  This only happens on Windows of course and it is wrong
and to me shows no confidence by the Mono group in their products on the
Windows platform.
