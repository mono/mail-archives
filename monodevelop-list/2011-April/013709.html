I never said Mono was, not sure why you bring this up. You have to Download
.Net 4.0 also which is the requirement so this is a wash.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>This is false on Windows. You can set Mono as the default, but you get the
message &quot;MonoDevelop is currently running on Microsoft .NET&quot; even though you
have a version of Mono selected as the default runtime.

I am only talking about RUNNING MonoDevelop 2.6 not running projects.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's correct. The installer requires .NET 4.0 and GTK# for .NET. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>This is my point and my problem.  That the installer requires this because
MonoDevelop requires this.  This is wrong to REQUIRE it, to allow it is
awesome to force it shows the Mono group has no confidence in running Mono
in real applications like MonoDevelop on Windows.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I agree that there is a performance delta between .Net and Mono and not only
on Windows, that the performance is the same on other platforms as it is on
Windows. I would think that the Mono Project would want to meet or beat .Net
performance on all platforms.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>This is the wrong attitude. Mono has gone commercial they offer commercial
licensing, commercial tools, and proprietary and commercial SDK's like
MonoTouch and Mono for Andriod.  If Mono is to be a commercial success they
have to take all platforms including Windows seriously. If you want large
companies to embed mono in their products Windows and or Cross Platforms
Novell (or Attachmate now) needs to treat it the commercial projects as
such, and take their dependencies on the OpenSource projects serious and
make them commercial-able.

The reason stuff like this is important to me, is that what would it say of
Microsoft if they said you have can only install Visual Studio on Linux to
develop for Windows? It says that they don't have confidence in there
development tools to work correctly on the platform they are design to
develop for.  

Right now the Mono Project is saying to develop for Mono on Windows with
their MonoDevelopment IDE you cannot run our product in Mono you have to run
it in .Net.  

As a company we find it critical to &quot;dog food&quot; are products in our
production environment before letting our customers use it.  What I see here
is Mono Project isn't &quot;dog food&quot;-ing Mono with their Mono based products on
Windows. I mean the Mono-Project first and for most should be about making
Mono the best they can and making sure everything they product that depends
on it runs well on it on all platforms. Then on windows you always want to
make sure they can also run on .Net but you should default to Mono.

I my group is in the middle of a research project for review mono for
viability for porting our C, Java (on Linux and Unix) and C, C# products (on
Windows) to Mono.  This means that Mono is important on Windows that we need
to be able to run successfully in Mono on a Windows system, as well as on
all our supported Linux and UNIX platforms.
