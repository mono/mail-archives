Window placement can also be impacted by the window manager.  Window
managers are free to choose which properties they honor, so if you are
using a non-mainstream window manager, that could be an issue as well.

As has been pointed out in previous messages on across the multiple
lists you are posting to, using a Gtk.Dialog and the Run method is the
recommended way to implement modal child windows in Gtk.  Calling
Application.Run multiple times in an application is not correct.
Dialog.Run does the nitty-gritty of setting up a correctly nested
mainloop.
