<PRE>As per the following that I sent to the GTK# Mailing List, I have done some further testing:


I have an application that creates other windows based on user response
to menu's, and I'd like them to be centred on the application.  So, I
have the following code, that I thought would work but I must be doing
something wrong, as all windows are appearing at the top left corner of
the screen, not the centre of the application.

                        win.WindowPosition = Gtk.WindowPosition.CenterOnParent;
                        
                        win.Modal = true;
                        win.TransientFor = this;

                        win.ShowAll();
                        Application.Run();

 
Can anyone shed some light on why the above code does not work ?        
 
and discovered, using the above code, that regardless of what I set the window position to, the window always appears at the top left of the screen.  I then tried in the GUI designer to set the window position via the drop down list and again it appears that MD (or Mono) does not take any note of the setting as the window appears at the top left of the screen.

In the above code, win is a window created in the MD GUI designer and then declared in the code and then the code above follows.  I don't know if this is something to do with my setup, or is a more general problem.  Is it possible for someone to create a simple test above and find out what then happens ?
