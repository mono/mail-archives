<PRE>This issue is related to Gtk# rather than Monodevelop, so you might want to send it to the Gtk# list.

However, I had exactly the same problem you mention. Since Gtk# only exposes the functionality of Gtk+ to managed code, there is no built-in databinding support available in Gtk#. Recently there have been discussions about this topic on the Gtk# mailing list and I think something needs to be done here.

I ended up writing a custom tree model for the tree view which displays DataViews(and previously I did one for DataTables, but then had problems with deleted lines which remain in the DataTable until the changes are commited, but cannot be accessed :-(  ). Sorry I cannot post you the source code of this tree model because I am writing this Mail from a Windows machine and want to build the Gtk# SVN version for Windows(and I am close to success), but you can browse the Gtk# mailing list archives and download the tree model there(already sent the DataView code together with a usage exmple to the list about 2 weeks ago).

I will talk to Mike and see if we want databinding support in Gtk# and if so, how it should look like.

  Hi,
  i want to use monodevelop to learn some c#.
  I have many problems regards stability of monodevelop, I'm running it on a debian sid 64, someone have problems too? (it gives many and many errors.)

  I have trouble to understand how this ide works,
  for example,
  i want to do a form with a button and a treeview
  I assign the click event on the button
  in this section i want to write some code
  how i can connect to my database for filling my treeview with the requested table?
  (SELECT * FROM example)
  In the database section I already have the right dbconnection working and i'm able to see all my tables
  I don't know what &quot;Views&quot; and &quot;Procedures&quot; are, and if I try to do a query giving it a name it give me many errors.
  I'm sorry, but I have the ide in Italian and I can't understand how to change it in the correct English language ... and so I can't assure you that in the english version you can see &quot;views&quot; and &quot;procedures&quot; over and under your tables
  I can run query from: tools -&gt; database -&gt; query database

  How I can do that?
  I see the mono-mysql documentation, but i found only that documentation is missing

  I try to click the green cross on the toolbars, so i check for viewing all the widgets in Monodevelop.Database.Components but nothing useful.

  I try to write like &quot;using...&quot; in the top but it don't give names related with db.

  Thank you in advance

  Christian
