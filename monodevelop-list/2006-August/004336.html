</I>Hi Marek,

The Prj2make executable found in the tools section of mcs, came first.  
My MonoDevelop contributions came later.  The changes in MonoDevelop's 
prj2make add-in are substantial enough to not be merged back into the 
Prj2make executable.  This mainly because the needs that the MonoDevelop 
Add-in satisfy have now diverged from the original intent of the stand 
alone executable.

I am currently working on a re-write of Prj2make to add support for MS 
VS2005 C# project types.  As I began the re-write I realized that it 
would be better to create a different executable than what it exist 
today -- I am tentatively calling it Prj2make2005.  In this new utility 
I will not support VS 2003 files.

As far as you becoming the maintainer for Prj2make, you have my blessing 
and support.

Paco
