<PRE>Hi,

I've just installed MonoDevelop 0.10 on Ubuntu 6.06LTS.
It seems there is a problem with the code completion. I created a project
and started coding but the popup of member information never appeared. I
checked the option of code completion too (as default).

Is there any suggestion or hints for solving this problem? Since the code
completion doesn't work, it is really hard to keep using MonoDevelop.

Thanks,
Alex D. B. Kim
