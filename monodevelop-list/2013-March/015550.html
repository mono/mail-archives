<PRE>Okay, I have build mono, monodevelop, gnome-sharp, gtk-sharp all from the
latest sources.  The segfault in the UI has stopped.  However, I still
cannot drop controls onto the form.

 

Any ideas on other ways I could possible design a UI?  

 

Perhaps some debug logs?

 

The UI looks completely normal, I can drag controls from the toolbox, but,
when I drop them onto the form, they just move back to the toolbox.  I would
imagine there must be a way to manually place controls onto forms.

 

Any ideas are greatly appreciated, I don't mind putting in the work to get
this resolved.  Even pointers on where in the source to start looking would
be great.  Thanks,

Damian

Sounds like you must be hitting a bug. This works for me on Mac, but I
haven't personally tested this on Windows.

 

I think someone else reported this bug last week on Windows.

 

Which version of Gtk# do you have installed? Did you make sure to get the
latest version that Xamarin shipped with the prebuilt versions of Xamarin
Studio? (I think they were like version 2.12.23 or so)

Just to confirm, I have now tried to drag and drop every single control in
the toolbox to the form, as soon as I let go of the mouse button, the
control appears to move back into the toolbox.

 

This is unbelievably frustrating btw.  Is this a weird feature or sorts?  

 

Thanks, 

 

Damian
