<PRE>I have a project (in MonoDevelop on Mac) which I have been porting from a
Visual Studio Windows project.

All has been going well. I have been compiling and running against 2.10.12
stable version of Mono.
(At least I think I have... that is what it has a tick mark against under
menu option
&lt;Project&gt; -&gt; &lt;Active Runtime&gt; 

However I have now discovered a part of the code that needs 
System.Security.Cryptography.CspParameters.CryptoKeySecurity.SetAccessRule(
... )

In 2.10.12 calling this method gives a NotImplementedException (because it
has not been implemented).

Then I noticed that in 3.0.6 this method HAS been implemented so I
thought... haha ... I'll try switching to the 3.0.6 version. 

In MonoDevelop I change the active runtime tick so that it is now ticked
against 3.0.6.

In &quot;Edit References&quot; there is only one list item for each name space... so
no obvious way of changing the target libraries there - so I was thinking,
maybe that is all I need to do... just change the &quot;active runtime&quot;.

However when I run the project I still get NotImplementedException ... 

Although I am new to MonoDevelop and not exactly sure what is going on, it
seems to be the case that the code is still running against 2.10.12 version
and ignoring the tick mark against the 3.0.6 version.

How do I change my project so that it runs against 3.0.6?
