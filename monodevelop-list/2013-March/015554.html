<PRE>Hi

Depends -  in many ways Linux is our best and some ways it's our worst
platform.
Let's begin what's not so good:

- Installation is difficult (you need to set up a built environment) -
forget the versions from the official sources, they're outdated
- The Linux eco system is bigger (at least compared to os x) and some bugs
may occur on untested environments/library combinations.
- We're focusing ATM more on OS X and Windows platforms - therefore we're
beginning to erode on Linux - slowly. For example we don't support gtk3 yet
or Qt development. (But frankly most of this stuff should be created by the
.NET community on Linux, which is ... too small unfortunately - I think I
know all of them from IRC :))

Now to the things that are really good/better on Linux:

+ We're a gtk program and despite our and Lanedo's efforts to improve gtk
on other platforms it runs best on Linux. The Linux UI is the fastest and
most stable out of all platforms.
+ You've less keyboard input problems. The Linux  version is the only one
where you can type with any layout and language inside MonoDevelop.
(Depending on what you use it's a big factor)
+ Because you need to built the mono stack from source you've the latest
versions available and if you report bugs you're getting fixes much more
earlier than you would by using one of our installers (therefore the
installation pain is also a gain)
+ MonoDevelop supports theming on Linux - I suspect that it'll break with
some dark themes - but generally you're more flexible on that than on the
other platforms
+ Highest coolness factor 'My IDE isn't even in the repositories' - I bet
you're the only one in your street who can say that :).

... in fact it's more or less equal on all platforms.

Regards
Mike

What is the preferred OS to use?  Perhaps I&#8217;m going in the wrong direction
&gt;<i> trying to run this on Linux.  Is monodevelop on windows stable?****
