<PRE>To be fair, I think the &quot;build from scratch&quot; of MonoDevelop is
comparatively simple for the size of the app. I've built both MD and
Banshee on my openSUSE box while making changes to them and MonoDevelop
has far fewer dependencies and was much easier to get going! After that,
it is basically just &quot;git pull &amp;&amp; ./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make
install&quot; each time you want to update.

openSUSE also has good Mono support in the openSUSE Build Service (as
someone else mentioned). They've not caught up with MonoDevelop quite
yet (although the MonoDevelop.com front page does still list 3.0 as the
latest!), but the Mono:Factory repository normally has an up-to-date
version of Mono and the latest pre-4.0 of MonoDevelop.

</I>&gt;<i> + You've less keyboard input problems. The Linux  version is the only
</I>&gt;<i> one where you can type with any layout and language inside
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop. (Depending on what you use it's a big factor)
</I>&gt;<i> + Because you need to built the mono stack from source you've the
</I>&gt;<i> latest versions available and if you report bugs you're getting fixes
</I>&gt;<i> much more earlier than you would by using one of our installers
</I>&gt;<i> (therefore the installation pain is also a gain)
</I>&gt;<i> + MonoDevelop supports theming on Linux - I suspect that it'll break
</I>&gt;<i> with some dark themes - but generally you're more flexible on that
</I>&gt;<i> than on the other platforms
</I>&gt;<i> + Highest coolness factor 'My IDE isn't even in the repositories' - I
</I>&gt;<i> bet you're the only one in your street who can say that :). 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ... in fact it's more or less equal on all platforms.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards
</I>&gt;<i> Mike
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         What is the preferred OS to use?  Perhaps I&#8217;m going in the
</I>&gt;<i>         wrong direction trying to run this on Linux.  Is monodevelop
