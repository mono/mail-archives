+1.   

BTW, I used Monodevelop for GUI .NET develop on LINUX for years.  It was
a really great package, and an excellent interface.  It was generally
very stable - a couple twitchy versions here and there.

Then the updates slowed to a trickle, nobody paid attention to
packaging, and it became [very sadly] clear that Mono and the luminaries
of that community have 'moved on' from Open solutions.  So I moved on as
well;  very happily still developing on LINUX with excellent tools, just
not Mono / Monodevelop any longer.

... assuming you want to do Android development in .NET.  There is
always Java, Python, etc...  which work perfect well.

&gt;<i> Personally, I develop my library code, library tests and GTK# interface
</I>&gt;<i> on Linux and my WinForms interface in Windows using VS.Net Express.
</I>
Yes.  The Gtk# designer and support in Monodevelop is bar none, one of
the nicest GUI design tools I've used.
