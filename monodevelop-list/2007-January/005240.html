<PRE>atsushi eno escribi&#243;:
&gt;<i> Thanks for the hints Lluis :) With icons and ambience, it became much
</I>&gt;<i> nicer than before.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - Is there already a way to get localized string for ClassType (such
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   as &quot;class&quot; and &quot;struct&quot;) ? I believe yes but don't know where.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Nope, AFAIK.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, now that types are accompanied by icons, there is no need to label
</I>&gt;<i> types with text anymore.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What I miss in this patch is a class selector, since there can be more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than one class in the same file. It would be also very useful to always
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> show in the combo the member where the cursor is positioned. AFAIR
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> somebody provided such a patch, but I don't remember what happened to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In fact my first patch (only put on #monodevelop) contains two
</I>&gt;<i> comboboxes, like what you have in mind and VS.NET has in reality.
</I>&gt;<i> After short discussion with Miguel, I changed it to single combobox
</I>&gt;<i> to use space more efficiently (as the new sshot shows, the formatted
</I>&gt;<i> members, especially methods, are likely to be quite wide). But it is
</I>&gt;<i> easy to switch back to the original two comboboxes, so I'd follow
</I>&gt;<i> your decision.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have some more questions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	- Does Ambience always exist? My patch premises its existence.
</I>&gt;<i> 	- I don't feel comfortable to use FocusChildSet for the ComboBox
</I>&gt;<i> 	  to detect control activation. Looks like it is invoked more
</I>&gt;<i> 	  than I want. Is there better signal to use? I have to say,
</I>&gt;<i> 	  I'm quite newbie in gtk land :|
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> New patch is attached, and new sshot is uploaded (it has only one
</I>&gt;<i> combobox for now):

Hey atsushi, this is a great feature! Just my two cents:

- Why not get the best of both worlds? If there is more than one class 
in the file, show two comboboxes, but if not, show one.

And I would go for hiding some information so as to avoid large combobox 
entries. For example I would hide keywords, pre-namespaces and type 
returned. Then, instead of:

virtual MonoDevelop.Ide.Gui.IViewContent CreateContentForMimeType(string 
  mimeType, System.IO.Stream content)

Just:

CreateContentForMimeType(strint mimeType, Stream content)


This way, it would be easier to look for the method we want and localize 
it by alphabetical order.

Regards,
