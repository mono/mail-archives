<PRE>Hi

It seems that some people are interested in the state of the fully
managed text editor (no gtksourceview dependency). Therefore I'll give a
status update.

First: I wouldn't recommend it for every day use.

However I plan to start working with it this week, when bookmarks, goto
line number and &quot;delete&quot; are working. 
Currently most of the implementation and integration work is done (but
bugfixing is not done...) - I hope to have something &quot;pre alpha&quot; mid/end
of february which users can play around with. It will support folding (I
can't promise that it'll be working in mono develop in february (the
capability is already there) but other features have higher priority.

It looks a bit like the sharp develop text editor (guess why ^^). But
it's a complete MIT-X11 re-write. It is fully managed and can be used
outside of mono develop for own applications too.

What works:
Code completion, semantic tooltips, error underlining and text editor
options (the panels are all new). 

Whats missing:
In monodevelop: Bookmarks, goto line number dialog, context menu (50%)
Generally: Only C# syntax highlighting.

Work that needs done:
- Implement missing features. 
- Optimization.
- Unit tests (currently I've problems with nunit on my system - I can't
run unit tests :/, I need to look why). 
- Bugfixing (An IDE needs a real stable editor)

The source code is in the mono develop trunk in:
main/src/addins/Mono.Texteditor

Here you can find the mono develop binding:
main/src/addins/MonoDevelop.SourceEditor2

Regards
Mike
