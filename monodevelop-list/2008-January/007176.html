<PRE>Hi,

On Jan 2, 2008 12:11 PM, Andr&#233; Offringa &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monodevelop-list">offringa at gmail.com</A>&gt; wrote:
&gt;<i> Hey all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These are some of the bugs that I found while translating MonoDevelop
</I>&gt;<i> into Dutch, as (will be) announced in my previous or next mail (server
</I>&gt;<i> seemed to have some delivery problems), divided into two categories;
</I>&gt;<i> plain textual errors and translation unabilities. My bugzilla account is
</I>&gt;<i> broken, so I figured I'd best mail them to this list; maybe someone else
</I>&gt;<i> can put them on bugzilla.
</I>
Will do.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Andre Offringa
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> == Textual incorrect ==
</I>&gt;<i> * &quot;Layout Managment&quot;, should be &quot;Management&quot;
</I>
Good catch.

&gt;<i> * in &quot;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Only Letters, Digits and Underline are allowed.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> underline should be underscore?
</I>
Yes. Also, looks like that string is missing a &lt;/i&gt;, so I suppose it's
split across multiple lines?

&gt;<i> * Emit Standard Header: emit has to be Apply or Omit?
</I>
Nope, &quot;Emit&quot; means approximately the same as the verb &quot;output&quot;. It
controls whether the &quot;standard header&quot; is added to new code files.

&gt;<i> * &quot;Use ccache&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> ccache should be cache?
</I>
No, ccache is a program for building C programs faster by using a cache.

&gt;<i> * &quot;a Glade# 2.0 project with one window and button&quot; -&gt; uppercase 'a' ?
</I>
Probably, though it might be a mis-extracted string. Worth checking.

&gt;<i> * Makefile variable '{0}' not found. Skipping syncing of {1} all
</I>&gt;<i> references for project {2}.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know what {1} should be, but this seems never to become a valid
</I>&gt;<i> sentence I think.
</I>
I agree. We'll need to check this.

&gt;<i> * &quot;Invalid regex for Error messages. : {0}&quot; (2 times)
</I>&gt;<i> extra period
</I>
Looks like it, yes.

&gt;<i> * &quot;Custom commands are not supported for autotools based makefiles.
</I>&gt;<i> Ignoring &quot;
</I>
I'm not sure. It may be mis-extracted (the Gettext string extraction
doesn't handle concatenated strings in C# right now).

&gt;<i> should have one or three periods.
</I>&gt;<i> * &quot;The desginer could not be loaded.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> desginer should be designer
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> * &quot;Substitutes the last substring matched by group number number (decimal).&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Two times &quot;number&quot;
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> * &quot;The required addin '{0}' is disabled.&quot; and &quot;The required addin '{0}'
</I>&gt;<i> is not installed.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;addin&quot; should be &quot;add-in&quot;
</I>
This is debatable, but we do need to standardise it. I'm not sure
which way it'll go -- MD seems to prefer &quot;addin&quot; but GNOME seems to be
heading towards &quot;extension&quot;.

&gt;<i> * I don't know what &quot;Load user-specific settings with the document&quot; in
</I>&gt;<i> preferences-&gt;save/load should do. Maybe rename it?
</I>
MD has *.userprefs files that contain per-user settings for solutions,
for example which files were loaded when it was last closed, which is
what it means by &quot;user-specific settings&quot;. Frankly I don't understand
why this is an option, as i can't see why anyone would disable it.
However, the meaning is relatively straightforward and I can't really
think of a better way to explain it.

&gt;<i> * &quot;a Glade# 2.0 project with one window and button&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> should begin with uppercase &quot;A&quot;
</I>
You listed this one already :)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> == Errors in behaviour (e.g. not translated) ==
</I>&gt;<i> * Almost the entire &quot;regular expression toolkit&quot; window remains English,
</I>&gt;<i> despite my Dutch translations in the .po file.
</I>
That's odd. So they're extracted, but not used?

&gt;<i> * Tooltips for Navigate back and forwards buttons leave the underscore
</I>&gt;<i> (used in the menu for the shortcut) in the text
</I>
Yes, I see this.

&gt;<i> * Title of &quot;New layout&quot; form is not translated
</I>&gt;<i> * The text &quot;up&quot; that is below the up button in the filebrowser is not in
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;.po&quot; file, though it is somehow translated to a default Dutch word
</I>&gt;<i> (&quot;op&quot;). However, the translation is incorrect in this context (it means
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;on top of&quot;, it should have been &quot;Omhoog&quot;), so it should also be in the
</I>&gt;<i> .po file and translated.
</I>
I guess it uses a GTK# stock button, so would use your system's
translations. We can fix this.

&gt;<i> * &quot;Current&quot; schema in preferences-&gt;keybindings window seems
</I>&gt;<i> untranslated, as well as the column names &quot;Key Binding&quot; and &quot;Description&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> * In preferences/changelog add-in, the default name and e-mail address
</I>&gt;<i> text-boxes are still in english, thus are untranslated (though their
</I>&gt;<i> labels are translated).
</I>&gt;<i> * The default layout is called &quot;Default&quot;, despite language.
</I>&gt;<i> * In the New file dialog, categories like &quot;Deployment&quot; and &quot;Misc&quot;, as
</I>&gt;<i> well as their subcategories, are untranslated.
</I>&gt;<i> * Same in &quot;new project&quot; dialog.
</I>
Good work! We'll fix these before we announce that strings are
finalised for translation.
