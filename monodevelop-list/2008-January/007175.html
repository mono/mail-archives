<PRE>Hey all,

These are some of the bugs that I found while translating MonoDevelop 
into Dutch, as (will be) announced in my previous or next mail (server 
seemed to have some delivery problems), divided into two categories; 
plain textual errors and translation unabilities. My bugzilla account is 
broken, so I figured I'd best mail them to this list; maybe someone else 
can put them on bugzilla.

Regards,
Andre Offringa

== Textual incorrect ==
* &quot;Layout Managment&quot;, should be &quot;Management&quot;
* in &quot;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Only Letters, Digits and Underline are allowed.&quot;
underline should be underscore?
* Emit Standard Header: emit has to be Apply or Omit?
* &quot;Use ccache&quot;
ccache should be cache?
* &quot;a Glade# 2.0 project with one window and button&quot; -&gt; uppercase 'a' ?
* Makefile variable '{0}' not found. Skipping syncing of {1} all 
references for project {2}.&quot;
I don't know what {1} should be, but this seems never to become a valid 
sentence I think.
* &quot;Invalid regex for Error messages. : {0}&quot; (2 times)
extra period
* &quot;Custom commands are not supported for autotools based makefiles. 
Ignoring &quot;
should have one or three periods.
* &quot;The desginer could not be loaded.&quot;
desginer should be designer
* &quot;Substitutes the last substring matched by group number number (decimal).&quot;
Two times &quot;number&quot;
* &quot;The required addin '{0}' is disabled.&quot; and &quot;The required addin '{0}' 
is not installed.&quot;
&quot;addin&quot; should be &quot;add-in&quot;
* I don't know what &quot;Load user-specific settings with the document&quot; in 
preferences-&gt;save/load should do. Maybe rename it?
* &quot;a Glade# 2.0 project with one window and button&quot;
should begin with uppercase &quot;A&quot;

== Errors in behaviour (e.g. not translated) ==
* Almost the entire &quot;regular expression toolkit&quot; window remains English, 
despite my Dutch translations in the .po file.
* Tooltips for Navigate back and forwards buttons leave the underscore 
(used in the menu for the shortcut) in the text
* Title of &quot;New layout&quot; form is not translated
* The text &quot;up&quot; that is below the up button in the filebrowser is not in 
the &quot;.po&quot; file, though it is somehow translated to a default Dutch word 
(&quot;op&quot;). However, the translation is incorrect in this context (it means 
&quot;on top of&quot;, it should have been &quot;Omhoog&quot;), so it should also be in the 
.po file and translated.
* &quot;Current&quot; schema in preferences-&gt;keybindings window seems 
untranslated, as well as the column names &quot;Key Binding&quot; and &quot;Description&quot;.
* In preferences/changelog add-in, the default name and e-mail address 
text-boxes are still in english, thus are untranslated (though their 
labels are translated).
* The default layout is called &quot;Default&quot;, despite language.
* In the New file dialog, categories like &quot;Deployment&quot; and &quot;Misc&quot;, as 
well as their subcategories, are untranslated.
* Same in &quot;new project&quot; dialog.

</PRE>
