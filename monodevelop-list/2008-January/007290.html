<PRE>Hello developers,

I seemed to have missed all &quot;fuzzy&quot; translations during updating the 
Dutch translations, so I have yet another new version of nl.po, which I 
will mail to Michael Hutchinson. While  updating the fuzzy-updated 
translations, I found many new issues, mainly caused by removing enters 
('\n') from the sentences. These were:

* NoneCharWordWordChar
-&gt;Misses spaces

* &quot;Error trying to read configure.in ('{0'}) for project '{1}':\n&quot;
&quot;{2}&quot;
-&gt; Misplaced quote (') in '{0'}

* &quot;Error in loading references: {0}. Skipping syncing of references&quot;
-&gt; misses a period.

* &quot;Show all packagesShow new versions onlyShow updates only&quot;
-&gt; Missing spaces

* &quot;Matches an ASCII character as octal (up to three digits);numbers with 
no &quot;
&quot;leading zero are backreferences if they have only one digit or if they &quot;
&quot;correspond to a capturing group number. (For more information, see &quot;
&quot;Backreferences.) For example, the character \\\\\\\\040 represents a 
space.&quot;
-&gt; No space after semicolon

* &quot;Matches an ASCII character using hexadecimal representation(exactly two &quot;
&quot;digits).&quot;
-&gt; misses a space between representation and '('

* &quot;Matches a Unicode character using hexadecimal representation(exactly 
four &quot;
&quot;digits).&quot;
-&gt; misses a space between representation and '('

* &quot;Positive character group.Matches any character in the specified 
character &quot;
&quot;group.&quot;
-&gt; misses a space between &quot;group.&quot; and &quot;Matches&quot;

* &quot;Negative character group.Matches any character not in the specified &quot;
&quot;character group.&quot;
-&gt; misses a space between &quot;group.&quot; and &quot;Matches&quot;

* &quot;Character range.Matches any character in a range of characters.&quot;
-&gt; misses a space between &quot;range.&quot; and &quot;Matches&quot;

* &quot;The period character.Matches any character except \\\\\\\n&quot;
&quot;. If modified by the Singleline option, a period character matches any &quot;
&quot;character.&quot;
-&gt; misses a space between character.&quot; and &quot;Matches&quot;
-&gt; Also, the '\n' is only escaped 7 times, while other characters are 
escaped 8 times.

* &quot;Matches any character in the Unicode general categoryor named block &quot;
&quot;specified by name (for example, Ll, Nd, Z, IsGreek, and IsBoxDrawing).&quot;
-&gt; misses a space between &quot;category&quot; and &quot;or&quot;

* &quot;Specifies that the match must occur at the end of the string, before 
\\\\\\\n&quot;
&quot; at the end of the string, or at the end of the line.&quot;
-&gt; The \n is only escaped 7 times.

* &quot;Specifies that the match must occur at the end of the string or 
before \\\\&quot;
&quot;\\\n&quot;
&quot; at the end of the string (ignores the Multiline option).&quot;
-&gt; The \n is only escaped 7 times.

* &quot;Specifies at least n matches;for example, (abc){2,}.&quot;
-&gt; misses a space between &quot;matches;&quot; and &quot;for&quot;

* &quot;Zero-width positive lookbehind assertion.Continues match only if the &quot;
&quot;subexpression matches at thisposition on the left. For example, (?&lt;=19)99 &quot;
&quot;matches instances of 99 that follow 19.This construct does not backtrack.&quot;
-&gt; misses a space between &quot;this&quot; and &quot;position&quot;
-&gt; misses a space between &quot;19.&quot; and &quot;This&quot;

* &quot;Zero-width negative lookbehind assertion.Continues match only if the &quot;
&quot;subexpression does not match at the position on the left.&quot;
-&gt; misses a space between &quot;assertion.&quot; and &quot;Continues&quot;

* &quot;Nonbacktracking subexpression (also known as a 'greedy' 
subexpression.)The &quot;
&quot;subexpression is fully matched once, and then does not participate 
piecemeal &quot;
&quot;in backtracking. (That is, the subexpression matches only stringsthat 
would &quot;
&quot;be matched by the subexpression alone.)&quot;
-&gt; misses a space between ')' and 'The'.
-&gt; I would also place the ')' in front of the period.
-&gt; misses a space between 'strings' and 'that'

* &quot;\\\\\\\n&quot;
&quot;umber&quot;
-&gt; 7 backspaces

* &quot;Matches the 'yes' part if the named capture string has a match; 
otherwise, &quot;
&quot;matches the 'no' part. The 'no' part can be omitted.If the given name 
does &quot;
&quot;not correspond to the name or number of a capturing group used in this &quot;
&quot;expression, the alternation construct is interpreted as an expression 
test.&quot;
-&gt; misses a space between &quot;omitted.&quot; and &quot;If&quot;  

Good luck!
