<PRE>Hello Miguel,

&gt;<i> Mhm, this looks like a lot of unnecessary gymnastics.
</I>I would love it to become easier again :)

&gt;<i> Perhaps the core question is: why is this failing to build for you?   I would try to get to the root of the problem instead of using band aids.
</I>
&gt;<i> Internally, some of our team members have continued to do all their MonoDevelop/Mono work in Linux, and none of this is necessary.
</I>Which build tools and build chain are they using?

I understand that it is much easier if you don't need to worry about
being able to build from source.

But even then, there has not been a build of Monodevelop on the
Jenkins server for a while:

The last successful build of MonoDevelop for RPM was in November 2015
(monodevelop-5.10.0):
<A HREF="https://jenkins.mono-project.com/view/Releases/job/stablerpm-stablepkg-monodevelop/">https://jenkins.mono-project.com/view/Releases/job/stablerpm-stablepkg-monodevelop/</A>

Same for Debian builds.

and the last successful build of a MonoDevelop tarball was in March 2016:
<A HREF="https://jenkins.mono-project.com/view/Releases/job/release-tarball-monodevelop/">https://jenkins.mono-project.com/view/Releases/job/release-tarball-monodevelop/</A>
monodevelop-6.0.0.4761.tar.bz2

I guess if those builds would be functional again, it would be easier
for the distributions as well to package MonoDevelop.

I hope we can find solutions soon,
  Timotheus
</PRE>
