Sorry, I'm a bit late here...

I tried everything but just don't get this to work on Windows. 

I found some dlls, but however I try to install them, the MonoDevelop (2.8) 
Theme won't change... 

I'd really like the Interface to have a darker colour (not only the code 
highlighting). 

And why put the selectbox into the settings when there's no manual anywhere that 
describes how to get different gtk themes to work?

Is it at all possible on Windows (Win 7 64Bit)? If so, can anyone provide a 
step-by-step guide that is easy to understand? (i have never worked with 
anything gtk-related before...)

I start to think that I should just stop trying. Put far too much time into this 
already...
