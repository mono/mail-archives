The Core and Extras split never was really finished. I had to spend too
much time tuning building stuff in other places.

Absolutely.

&gt;<i>- things that are not stable enough to be in Core (we'll make an

</I>
The debugger should move.

&gt;<i>- anything with odd dependencies
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I actually think MonoDeveloperExtensions can probably move from Extras
</I>&gt;<i>to Core.
</I>
Not sure, read below.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Last I don't think Extras should be included in the normal auto* build,
</I>&gt;<i>as it makes distcheck harder, etc. They should either each have their
</I>&gt;<i>own build methods, or one top-level auto setup for Extras.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I disagree. Here is my opinion on that. Everything in Extras/ should
either a) be conditionally built based on various package availability,
and/or b) be --enable-this-plugin switched on/off. Having a single
unified build system is far better in general, and makes it easier to
build tarballs/etc. The only things (IMO) in Core/ should be stuff that
either a) MonoDevelop *requires* or b) MonoDevelop users basically
require (for an example, the C# binding is not 'required' by
monodevelop, however, most of our users would like to see it built and
installed by default).

Any thoughts?
