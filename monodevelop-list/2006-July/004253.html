<PRE>Some comments:
      * Forcing all language bindings and other parser users to link
        against Cecil just to be able to reuse one enum is not a good
        deal. We don't really need that dependency.
      * In ReflectionReturnType.cs, maybe you should set the arrays
        ArrayList to null once it has been converted to an int[], since
        it won't be needed anymore.

other than that, the patch looks great. More comments inline.


&gt;<i> Discussion:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You will notice, that generic types have a '`#' appended to their names.
</I>&gt;<i> Since Alejandro and Miguel have pointed out that this is the standard
</I>&gt;<i> naming convention of CLS (and it sure makes perfect sence), I have
</I>&gt;<i> decided that FullyQualifiedNames MUST preserve this naming convention.
</I>&gt;<i> But since language bindings don't understand this naming convention (and
</I>&gt;<i> since MonoDevelop's code completion doesn't trim the aforementioned
</I>&gt;<i> suffix) MonoDevelop doesn't recognize generic types, and hence members
</I>&gt;<i> for all generic types are invisible for now. (Note that generic members
</I>&gt;<i> of non-generic types ARE visible already...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To solve this, I suggest the following (a short term solution):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - we introduce a new method in IAmbience - namely 'string
</I>&gt;<i> ConvertName(IClass)', which only removes the suffix and perhaps adds the
</I>&gt;<i> generic parameters (e.g.: enclosed in '&lt;' and '&gt;' for C#).
</I>
I think that by providing the correct ConversionFlags combination we can
already get this text using the existing 'Convert' method. And if not,
maybe we should add new flags.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - we introduce a new property in the CodeCompletionWindow which contains
</I>&gt;<i> the correct 'completionString'. Now, it seems, that MonoDevelop uses the
</I>&gt;<i> string which is used in the code completion popup to display names, but
</I>&gt;<i> the problem is that characters '&lt;' and '&gt;' get replaced by '&amp;lt;' and
</I>&gt;<i> '&amp;gt;' - which makes no sense in the SourceEditor...
</I>
This looks like a bug. I don't see the need of using the pango formatted
text in the completion window. We should check what's wrong there.

Thanks.
Lluis.
