I don't know much about CMake, so I can't address its pros and cons, but
I would imagine that if someone created an addin for it, it would get
added.

As for Autotools, yes it is hard.  But at least now the process of
creating them is automated.  Miguel was talking about just using a
configure script and standard makefiles.  This may be possible, though
it would require manually creating a lot of the processes that autotools
currently provides.

I assume you are speaking of switching the build system of MD itself to
CMake?  I would think there would have to be a more compelling reason to
switch.  That would be Lluis's decision too.
