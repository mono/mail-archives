I have introduced a new flag, namely 'ShowGenericParameters'. I have
changed CSharpAmbience.cs to use it and it does just what we would
expect.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - we introduce a new property in the CodeCompletionWindow which contains
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the correct 'completionString'. Now, it seems, that MonoDevelop uses the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; string which is used in the code completion popup to display names, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the problem is that characters '&lt;' and '&gt;' get replaced by '&amp;lt;' and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; '&amp;gt;' - which makes no sense in the SourceEditor...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This looks like a bug. I don't see the need of using the pango formatted
</I>&gt;<i> text in the completion window. We should check what's wrong there.
</I>
Yup. Check out the attached patch and you'll see where the problem was
(ListWindow.cs). But do we really have to use a Pango.Layout for this?

Besides generics, I've been playing with the WelcomePage a little.
Actually, I would like to change the welcome page to that it will not
use XSL files anymore, but would rather draw a widget that would look
just as well (or even better) than what we have now. Such a welcome page
would give us greater freedom of i18n and user interaction. Hell, we
could even use Cairo to draw some fancy stuff (with shadows - yummy!)
and perhaps include some 3D animation as well :D Oh, and don't forget
about the new logo! Yummy!

Oh, apropos, I really like the 3D logo (that wrist workout thingy) :D I
forgot who did it... but it really looks nice.
