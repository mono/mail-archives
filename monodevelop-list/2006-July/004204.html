<PRE>Thanks Lluis for the link. Seeing as SharpDevelop is using the LGPL license
for the Resource Editor, I think I will be save by licensing the ported code
as LGPL as well. I will hopefully have the outstanding items completed
before the end of this month. Will keep you posted of my progress.

I also started looking into working on adding Web Service References to
projects. Have a pretty good understanding of what needs to be done. Will
use SharpDevelop as a point of reference, and port their implementation over
to fit into the MonoDevelop framework. I know you have done some work on
this as well a while back. I will start working on this as soon as I
completed the major functionality issues for the Release Editor.

Regards

Gideon de Swardt

Subject: Re: [MonoDevelop] Resource Editor AddIn

Hi!

&gt;<i> Hi All
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have managed to successfully integrate the Resource Editor into
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop and most of the basic functionality is there. You are able
</I>&gt;<i> to add more resource whether it be a string value or an actual file.
</I>&gt;<i> There are still some outstanding items that needs to be done before it
</I>&gt;<i> is ready for release but the basic framework is all there and working.
</I>&gt;<i> Please see attached the screenshot of the Resource Editor into
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop.
</I>
That's a good start. I hope you can finish it so it can be integrated in
MD.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have started porting the Resource Editor from SharpDevelop, and
</I>&gt;<i> quickly realize that most parts needs to be rewritten to use GtkSharp.
</I>&gt;<i> So I only ended up using some functionality for loading and saving
</I>&gt;<i> files, the ResourceItem class and the IResourceView interface for
</I>&gt;<i> displaying the values of different data types. My big question is,
</I>&gt;<i> seeing as this is my first ever opensource project that have worked on I
</I>&gt;<i> am not sure under which license I should license the Resource Editor.
</I>&gt;<i> Clearly some of the work derived from SharpDevelop, but a lot of the
</I>&gt;<i> source code was build from scratch. Any help would be much appreciated.
</I>
