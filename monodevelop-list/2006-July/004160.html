<PRE>Hi Lluis,

Thanks for your comments!

</I>Good catch, done.

&gt;<i>       * The idea of the 1 sec delay is to avoid updating the combo at

</I>&gt;<i>         avoiding them. That is, if you get a ParseInformationChanged
</I>&gt;<i>         event, and a combo update is already scheduled, you should not
</I>&gt;<i>         schedule a new update.
</I>Doh! Yep that was pretty silly. Fixed now.

&gt;<i>       * Instead of using a dictionary to store name-&gt;IClass relations,
</I>&gt;<i>         you can add a new data item in the list store of type Object,
</I>&gt;<i>         and directly store the IClass or IMember reference there.
</I>I was trying to think of a way to remove these. I never thought of using
the list store, I've changed it to use this method now.

&gt;<i>       * We need the corresponding ChangeLog entries.
</I>This was already at the bottom of the first patch, or did you mean
something else?

&gt;<i>       * It would be nice to add an option to the editor configuration
</I>&gt;<i>         panel to enable/disable the class bar.
</I>
&gt;<i>       * It would be nice to always show in the method combo the method
</I>&gt;<i>         on which the editor cursor is positioned.
</I>These last two look a little more challenging. I have been looking at
the second one this evening and my main challenge has been trying to
find a way to tell what line number the cursor is currently positioned
on. Once I have this figured out I thought I would use
member.Region.BeginLine and member.Region.EndLine to figure out if the
cursor was inside a members region, however beginline and endline always
seem to return the same line number!

I haven't had a chance to look into the configuration panel yet.
Hopefully later this week.

I'll submit a new version of the patch once I get these last two
features finished.

Thanks very much for some great feedback!
Cheers,
James

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Attached is a patch I hope people will find useful. It adds a couple of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; combos to the top of the editor that provide quick access to classes and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their methods/properties/members in the same  manner as VS.NET allows.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The combos are rebuilt dynamically as the parse information changes, so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as you type in a new method signature it will appear in the method
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; combo.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If the file doesn't provide any valid parse information e.g it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an .aspx file rather than a .cs file the combos disappear.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is my first real contribution to MonoDevelop so please go easy on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; me! I hope I have followed coding conventions properly. Also I didn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; know what the etiquette around adding my name to the Authors list was so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if it isn't appropriate please remove it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; James Fitzsimons
