<PRE>Hi

Here is a new patch. Many thanks go to Jb Evain for his explanations on
Cecil.

Check! Have changed it to System.Reflection.GenericParameterAttributes -
which is compatible with Mono.Cecil.GenericParamAttributes.

</I>&gt;<i>         it won't be needed anymore.
</I>
I have fixed that a couple of hours ago - was just about to post the new
patch. (I have introduced a local variable for that reason and it is
lazily created - that's because it's quite more often NOT needed than it
is...)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> other than that, the patch looks great. More comments inline.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Discussion:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You will notice, that generic types have a '`#' appended to their names.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Since Alejandro and Miguel have pointed out that this is the standard
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; naming convention of CLS (and it sure makes perfect sence), I have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decided that FullyQualifiedNames MUST preserve this naming convention.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But since language bindings don't understand this naming convention (and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; since MonoDevelop's code completion doesn't trim the aforementioned
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suffix) MonoDevelop doesn't recognize generic types, and hence members
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for all generic types are invisible for now. (Note that generic members
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of non-generic types ARE visible already...)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To solve this, I suggest the following (a short term solution):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - we introduce a new method in IAmbience - namely 'string
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ConvertName(IClass)', which only removes the suffix and perhaps adds the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; generic parameters (e.g.: enclosed in '&lt;' and '&gt;' for C#).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that by providing the correct ConversionFlags combination we can
</I>&gt;<i> already get this text using the existing 'Convert' method. And if not,
</I>&gt;<i> maybe we should add new flags.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Aye. Will look into it later.

&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - we introduce a new property in the CodeCompletionWindow which contains
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the correct 'completionString'. Now, it seems, that MonoDevelop uses the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; string which is used in the code completion popup to display names, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the problem is that characters '&lt;' and '&gt;' get replaced by '&amp;lt;' and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; '&amp;gt;' - which makes no sense in the SourceEditor...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This looks like a bug. I don't see the need of using the pango formatted
</I>&gt;<i> text in the completion window. We should check what's wrong there.
</I>
Well, I have already tested the new generics data with the ConvertName
method (which appends generic parameters for classes - and is then shown
in the code completion window) but I tried only with &amp;gt; and &amp;lt;
entities... Perhaps it is not pango formatted... I will check that.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks.
</I>&gt;<i> Lluis.
</I>&gt;<i>

Enjoy,
