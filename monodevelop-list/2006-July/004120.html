</I>&gt;<i> way.
</I>
I think this is the correct way.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I also think that it should probably be enabled by default for all class
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; libraries as that is our mechanism to find/locate libraries (Lluis is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; talking about adding this feature to the GUI for the &quot;Add References&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bit, so it will fit nicely).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure how I would do this.  How would I know which solution is a
</I>&gt;<i> class library?  In terms of MonoDevelop, creating a solution of type
</I>&gt;<i> 'Library' just instantiates a base setup.  There is no information held
</I>&gt;<i> within the solution that specifies that this is what it is.  Maybe Lluis
</I>&gt;<i> has an idea, or maybe I am missing something.
</I>
I think handling all this at solution level is ok. You only need to
generate a .pc file if the solution contains at least one library.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another question: This pkgconfig file allows people to compile against
</I>&gt;<i> the libraries, but it still doesn't help them at runtime.  Both Banshee
</I>&gt;<i> and MD have pc files set up this same way.  Though I understand that the
</I>&gt;<i> primary uses of their pc files would be plugins.
</I>
In the case of MD and Banshee, yes.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, I suspect that we would want to enable people to release an
</I>&gt;<i> independent library upon which other applications could use.  I see on
</I>&gt;<i> the deployment guidelines page
</I>&gt;<i> ( <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Guidelines:Application_Deployment#Libraries_with_Unstable_APIs">http://www.mono-project.com/Guidelines:Application_Deployment#Libraries_with_Unstable_APIs</A> ) 
</I>&gt;<i> there is a defined process for doing this in a pc file.  
</I>&gt;<i> This involves adding a separate variable with which consumers can use to copy 
</I>&gt;<i> the dlls into the base directory.  Yet, I have never seen this used.  
</I>&gt;<i> So, should this be implemented?
</I>
It's very easy to implemente, so I would say yes.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This brings up another issue: Installation to GAC.  Probably that should
</I>&gt;<i> be implemented as well.  We would then need some notion of an unstable
</I>&gt;<i> versus a stable library in MD.  This could be something that the
</I>&gt;<i> autotools addin stores, but it may be worthwhile for MD to track it so
</I>&gt;<i> that others may use this info ( NAnt, etc. ).
</I>
I think we can add an &quot;Install to GAC&quot; flag in DeployTarget (or maybe in
a new subclass DotNetDeploymetTarget). In this way a solution could have
different deploy targets for unstable and stable releases.

Lluis.
