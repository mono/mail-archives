Well, the situation is that I might have a solution that has a number of
libraries, for example, I could have a non-GUI library (mylib), then a
GUI library that builds on the other (mylib-gui)

And I should be able for example to build app that only requires mylib,
but not mylib-gui.   

Alternatively, I could have a dozen of libraries in my solution, and
there is really no need for a third-party application to depend on a
dozen libraries just because we chose to generate .pc files for the
whole solution instead of .pc files on a per-library basis.


&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not sure how I would do this.  How would I know which solution is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; class library?  In terms of MonoDevelop, creating a solution of type
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 'Library' just instantiates a base setup.  There is no information held
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; within the solution that specifies that this is what it is.  Maybe Lluis
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; has an idea, or maybe I am missing something.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think handling all this at solution level is ok. You only need to
</I>&gt;<i> generate a .pc file if the solution contains at least one library.
</I>
I think this is not right ;-)

I think that we should generate a .pc file for each .dll target (library
target).  

(In fact, I might even go further than this, and say that we might want
a .pc file *per* project, as .pc files are very useful to check for
dependencies and versions, so people could say &quot;You need f-spot 1.2.3&quot;
using pkg-config).

But again, I think we need to have this at the project-level, not the
solution level.

Miguel.
