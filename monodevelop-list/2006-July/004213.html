<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; And thinking again about the colors, which I still don't like very much:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; why don't play here with colors that we all know coming from other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; logos? For example, using the three colors of the GTK's logo ([2]) and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one grey colour from the mono logo ([3]).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with Andres.  The colors along with the design make the logo
</I>&gt;<i> look like a mangling of the VS logo, which is a Bad Thing in my
</I>&gt;<i> opinion. (As I stated in #monodevelop yesterday.)
</I>
The four colors used in the Visual Studio Logo are actually Red, Yellow,
Blue and Green, where as the colors in the proposed logo is Orange, Red,
Blue and Yellow. 

In the end I think we should ask ourselves what would be the most attractive
logo for the end user, whom in turn might not even worry about the old
ancient battle of Microsoft vs. the world. I know that I don't care about
it, and I am a newly converted from the old Microsoft world. Having the best
looking logo, rather than the most political correct one, would help prickle
the interest of future users.

If I am not mistaken, the future audience of MonoDevelop will be old
Microsoft hackers whom want to develop software for multiple platforms. They
in turn are less interested in the ancient battle and more interested in
having a feature rich development environment to help them to get the job
done as quickly as possible.
