<PRE>Jan,

I see that &quot;git add .&quot; doesen't seem to be the most suitable one. A lot of
tutorials and guides seemed to prefer that method, thanks for telling me
about the new commands, and they seem to work as expected.

And the gitignore you specified is essentially the same I have for my
project. I was moving the MD sources to a branch for my own test commits,
and since it uses autotools, a lot of files are modified. I found running
&quot;git status &gt;&gt; .gitignore&quot; after the build wrote an unformatted list of all
changed files, which I could conviniently ignore, but I kept thinking there
has to be a better way.

It would be best for the git plugin for MD check wether the current project
is being tracked as a repository (usually when people init the repository
after having some sources already existing.) and then write a gitignore if
the user wants it to be written specifically.

Matt,
I think this would be best as part of the managed git project. Do let me
know when this feature is in place, I don't think it would take too long to
implement.

Thanks,
Andy

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you make a commit. You can either add all the files that have changed or
</I>&gt;<i> add
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; them individually. Most people do &quot;git add .&quot; which does the former.

</I>&gt;<i> You can either use 'git commit -a', which gives you the same behaviour as
</I>&gt;<i> 'svn commit', namely it updates all files git already knew about, but does
</I>&gt;<i> not add any new ones. Or you can use 'git add -u', which is the same thing,
</I>&gt;<i> without the commit bit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But my impression is, that git hackers actually add individual files
</I>&gt;<i> whenever
</I>&gt;<i> they get them in some consistent state, often even carefuly pick individual
</I>&gt;<i> hunks with 'git add -i' (or use the equivalent operations in git gui).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All that said, the ignore list is indeed a good thing. But it should mostly
</I>&gt;<i> be constant for all MD projects. So far I get away with:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> bin
</I>&gt;<i> *.md.pc
</I>&gt;<i> *.pidb
</I>&gt;<i> *.userprefs
</I>&gt;<i> *.usertasks
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (I did not try any installer or localization projects yet, so there may be
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> few extras, but it should be mostly constant for each project type.)
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (*) I've followed git mailing list for some time, read quite a bit about it
</I>&gt;<i> and understand most of the principles.
