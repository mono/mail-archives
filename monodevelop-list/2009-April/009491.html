</I>&gt;<i> Hello, sorry if this has been posted before but something about MonoDevelop
</I>&gt;<i> is a major turn off for me. How come it decides to remap all of the standard
</I>&gt;<i> Mac OSX buttons?
</I>
MonoDevelop *doesn't* remap its commands. We need to map MD's commands
to a good set of OS-X-like accelerators. Suggestions for the
keybindings from mac user would be appreciated, as we don't have any
Mac users on the MD team, so don't have familiarity with how a Mac app
should &quot;feel&quot;.

&gt;<i> For example in every Mac OS X application you can press Command-C to copy
</I>&gt;<i> and Command-V to paste.
</I>&gt;<i> However in MonoDevelop this does nothing and you have to press Control-C to
</I>&gt;<i> copy and Control-V to paste? Its like its designed for some Windows
</I>&gt;<i> developer who has never used a Mac.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How to quit it? Again Command-Q to quit does nothing. Going to the Mac
</I>&gt;<i> MenuBar&gt;&gt;MonoDevelop&gt;&gt;Quit is ignored. The only thing that works is using
</I>
Mac menu support is fixed in SVN as part of the main menu integration
I just completed.

&gt;<i> the Windows Paradigm of finding the 'File' menu inside of MonoDevelop and
</I>&gt;<i> clicking on 'Quit'. It also tells me that Control-Q works. Why?
</I>
The Mac OS adds the quit command to that menu automatically, even
though we hadn't implemented a handler.

&gt;<i> It seems that wherever I'd use Command in the Mac, only for this applicaiton
</I>&gt;<i> I have to remember to use Control. Please someone tell me there is an easy
</I>&gt;<i> way to 'turn off clever windows buttons' and just use the Mac OS X Standard?
</I>
Although we appreciate feedback on what needs to be fixed, assuming
that we're *trying* to making things hard for Mac users is not
helpful. The problem is that we haven't yet had the time/resources to
implement much special handling for the Mac. I'm currently in the
process of making MD integrate better with Mac.

&gt;<i> Right clicking: Don't ask my why but on my mouse the right click button
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be broken. This isn't a problem because I can use Control-Left
</I>&gt;<i> Click in Mac OSX which does the same thing. This works for all but
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop which just ignores it because the Control button seems remapped.
</I>
This is a GTK+ issue. There is no &quot;remapping&quot; going on. GTK+ captures
raw mouse events in order to map them to GTK+ mouse events, but the
authors of the GTK+ Mac port didn't implement Ctrl-click behaviour.
There's a patch in GTK+ Bugzilla, but they don't seem to want to
accept it. I'm going to try to work around this in managed code.

&gt;<i> Additionally this may be a seperate issue but any form of lists on
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop (like lists of files) seems to have a few issues on my Mac. When
</I>&gt;<i> I click a file it seems to select it in memory but it doesn't show that its
</I>&gt;<i> been selected on the screen. I have to remember which ones I selected.
</I>
There are some redraw issues in the Mac GTK+. We're going to have to
track these down and fix them in GTK+; there's nothing we can do about
this in MD.
