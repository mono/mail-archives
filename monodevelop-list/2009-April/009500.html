Sure, well as a Mac user and a firm supporter of what you are trying to do
with Mono, I'd be very happy to provide you with feedback on the Mac. Just
let me know what you need from me. I'm also aware of you are targetting
multiple platforms so there is no way to give things complete Mac feel as of
yet, but there is a middle ground of usability. 

For starters while the characters the shortcuts bind to are in most cases
quite acceptable and have somethings in common with the Windows world we
merely need to tweak it to use Command-&lt;key&gt; for default as opposed to
Control. (For the sake of clarity and as I'm sure you are aware the Command
key is also known as the Apple key/pretzel, and is the same as the 'Start'
button on a Windows keyboard). 

Examples:
Command-C: Copy
Command-X: Cut
Command-V: Paste
Command-W: Close current tab/document
Command-Q: Quit

Shout if there is anything else you need from me.
