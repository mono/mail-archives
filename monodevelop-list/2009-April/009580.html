</I>about this Michael, for example I still use MWF-designer from time to 
time and is not updated for a long time, I know that you tell me some 
time ago that lot of work is needed to complete that work and have a 
proper winform designer on MD, but as far as I know the MWF-designer do 
his job properly at least for simple task (yeap may be one as good as 
the vs.net one or the gtk# one on MD is hard but may be a simple one can 
be posible) and this is a question that pop up over and over on the list.
If one of the goals is have more programmers and windows programmers to 
linux/mono/MD I think that this is a &quot;must have&quot; feature at least in a 
basic way, to make guys feels more comfortable and then show him all the 
gtk good things.

So my question is: how much work is really needed to have some basic 
support for this integrated on MD?, may be I can ask to thesis guys here 
on my Univ to take the job...it is posible?
