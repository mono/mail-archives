&gt;<i> space or something else like that if tab is considered ambiguous but

Yes, I agree.

It is very often that I want to use something that is not yet declared.
When I'm implementing some algorithm I often take the top-down approach,
so I'm writing code that is calling at-the-time non-existing methods,
using not-yet declared variables, or using classes from not yet
referenced libraries.

At the moment every key is doing completion and you end up with
something you don't want. You have to take constant care if MD didn't
change what you have written.

When I know what I want to write, and I write it fast, I get strange
results, because I didn't push ESC few times, even when writing exactly
what I wanted to get. When writing fast, I don't even recognize
the completion window has pop up (its really fast now - congrats!).

(try to qucikly write in random method: Call(index); )


What's more - I don't think such aggressive behavior is good.
Even if it only destroys what the user writes once in a day, the bad 
impression from that will be bigger then a perfect impression for the
rest of the day.


Because of that, I think the completion should only be activated on
Enter and Tab. Leaving other keys do what they are supposed to do.
(maybe allow users to turn on the current behavior, but please don't
do it the default one).

My two cents
