Compiling is fine; I have a parallel mono 2.4 install in my home
directory to work around the fact that Ubuntu has shipped broken
installs of Mono for a while now.  Jaunty coming out has Mono 2.0 and
MD 2.0.  I really need Mono 2.4, and the Mono 2.0 packaged for Ubuntu
is buggy buggy buggy (far more buggy than the Mono 2.0 I compiled when
it was released and used in my home directory).

You can go to <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/">http://www.mono-project.com/</A> and download the sources to
build them yourself, for everything from Mono 2.4 all the way up to
MonoDevelop 2.0.  It's relatively simple for most of it, just build the
software normally for any source distribution that has a build system
shipped with it, and you shouldn't have any problems.  Just remember
that when building MonoDevelop, its configure script is strange
compared to the norm.
