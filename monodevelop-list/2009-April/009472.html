I think we definitely need something like this, since the notebook's
pretty unusable with large numbers of tabs right now. I tend to use
shift-tab, or alt-shift-open. However, the ellipsised names can get
awkward especially when they're really small.

The number of responses to this email show that people have many
different ideas of how it should be done :) IMO it would be useful to
see how other IDEs do it but also web browsers, since people are
familiar with how tabs work in web browsers.

I agree that the icons looks like a low-hanging fruit for elimination,
though they can be useful visual indicators, particularly the welcome
page, and also in ASP.NET projects.

A couple of other ideas I'd throw into the mix are:
a) Use a smaller font size, maybe the custom pad font that's already defined.
b) Instead of having arrows at either end for scrolling, have a
dropdown list like Firefox or VS.
c) Only display the close button when hovering over a tab, and paint
it on top of the text, so as not to jitter the layout.

I also really like the way that VS does it, which is to remove tabs
from the right when the bar overflows. The documents are then
accessible from the (b) dropdown list, and selecting then adds them
back on the left, so that the most recently used documents are always
visible. No shrinkage necessary.

The thing I'd really like to avoid is additional settings. I'm sure we
can find a mixture of ideas that works for most people.
