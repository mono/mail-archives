&gt;<i> &gt; I am playing with some Vala code in monodevelop. I currently have two

&gt;<i> &gt; few more. And I have a problem with the reference from the test project to 
</I>the
&gt;<i> &gt; library one works only partly.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I mean, the valac is given correct .vapi file to generate the code, but it 
</I>is
&gt;<i> &gt; *not* given either include path nor the library file for the C compiler, so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; vala generates the C sources, but compiling them fails.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi, it's great to see someone using MD for Vala!
</I>
I am contemplating doing some core stuff in Vala and combining it with gui in
C# (or even more preferably Boo if the gui builder starts working with it
in the meantime), so MD is kind of logical choice. Plus I am used to VS from
work.

&gt;<i> I think valac's behavior in this respect has changed semi-recently; if
</I>&gt;<i> I recall correctly, it used to be that, if one were compiling directly
</I>&gt;<i> to binaries, neither the include path nor the linker path were
</I>&gt;<i> required. (What version of Vala are you using?)
</I>
I was using 0.5.7. I updated MD to 2.0.0 from Debian, but forgot to check valac 
updates (I disabled automatic updates because I don't want to do the KDE 
transition just yet). But I just retried with 0.7.0 and it seems to behave 
exactly the same.

&gt;<i> &gt; I have currently worked around the problem by manually adding
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; appropriate --Xcc= options in the Build/Code Generation properties. But as 
</I>I
&gt;<i> &gt; said, I plan to add a few more projects and it will quickly grow ugly.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do you have any better proposal? Or should this be reported as a (possibly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wish-list) bug?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is definitely a bug. I'll address it as soon as possible.
</I>
Thanks.

Best regards,
Jan
