<PRE>Andr&#233;s:
Your method might work quite well, but would look really really odd if a
user has a few tabs open. Multiple tabs are pretty hard to get right. You'd
have to make sure that enough tabs are open and then start trimming the
names.

It would take a good algorithm with solid unit tests for the devs to merge
this into the master branch. To find longest common substrings would be
pretty easy from an algorithmic perspective, but to decide when to apply
these rules will be hard.

I've used the Extended VS mode for Eclipse, which comes with the &quot;minimalist
view&quot; mode optimized for smaller screens and more files, without excessive
eyecandy. You can see how it looks here:
<A HREF="http://andrei.gmxhome.de/skins/extendedvs_mini.gif">http://andrei.gmxhome.de/skins/extendedvs_mini.gif</A> . I think this sort of a
view makes more economic view of the screen real estate, while still keeping
things simple.

For a start, I propose the following changes
1. Cull &quot;.cs&quot; from end of the title.
2. Have two states for a MonoDevelop.Ide.Gui.tabLabel - Full(icon + name +
and stripped. It's full if the tab is active and stripped if it isn't. Write
a function to switch between the two. Hook into
MonoDevelop.Ide.Gui.SdiWorkbench.tabControl's change event and somehow find
which document is active and expand it's tab label.

Levi,
Your idea was the same Mike suggested earlier. The problem is that adding an
icon and a close button changes the width. Adding them on mouseover and
removing them on mouseout would lead to a very jerky experience if the user
just moves across the tab bar, not to mention it would be a usability
nightmare.

Thank you,
Andy
