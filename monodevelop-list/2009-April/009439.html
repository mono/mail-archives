</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any other suggestions or thoughts?
</I>
Let's try to think about another &quot;best of both worlds&quot; concept
surrounding Andreia's use case:

a) Use a certain amount of characters by default in non-current tabs
(for instance 7, as the first proof of concept).
b) For every tab that, for the default amount of characters, has any
coincidence with the stripped-name of other tab, increase the amount of
shown characters by N + 3 (being N the number of characters left for
still being the same).
c) Repeat (b) until there are no coincidences.

Example:

Files: Main.cs, ProcessOpener.cs, FileOrderStructure.cs,
FileOrderResolver.cs

Result (supposing all are non-current tabs): Main.cs, Process...,
FileOrderRes..., FileOrderStr...

(in this case, N == 2)

Andreia, would that fit your point of view?

Regards,

	Andr&#233;s
