I can't say that I understand; I've not seen a release of KDE work
since 4.0.0.  Configurability is nothing if you can't even run in an
average system.  :)

Of course, I think that GNOME is too simple, and needs to at least be
configurable more behind the scenes even if the UI doesn't support it
directly.  Certain esoteric options do not belong in the UI, they do
however need to be accessible.  For a GNOME user, that means putting
the configuration values in a GConf database.

I think that, however, these options as we've been discussing them
would all fit on their own tab, possibly with some other ones migrated
to that tab that pertain to code completion.  Having a lot of
configuration options is not a problem *if* they're laid out in an
intuitive fashion!
