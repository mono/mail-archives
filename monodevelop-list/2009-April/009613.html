The logical place for this feature to go would be the Git addin,
though it would be useful even before all the other git features are
implemented.

Right now, MD has no mechanism for determining ignored files, but I
guess these are pretty much the inverse of the files that the VCS
addin explicitly adds, so it shouldn't be too hard to do
automatically. Alternatively we could have some API that addins could
use to flag files for ignoring.

MD could then set svn:ignore too, which so something we've always had
to do manually. The common ones IIRC are ProjectName.pidb,
SolutionName.userprefs, SolutionName.usertasks, *~, build/, bin/.
Autotools also requires selective ignoring of Makefile, Makefile.in,
configure and a load of directories.
