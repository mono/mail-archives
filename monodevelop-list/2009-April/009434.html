<PRE>Andr&#233;s: I think that's a pretty neat idea, to have the icon and close button
on the active tab and removed on the other tabs. I'll try to hack together a
proof of concept in the evening. This seems to be similar to how most other
applications do their tab functionality. It also seems to avoid accidental
closing from stray clicks on the close button.
The behaviour will be: Current tab would look like how a regular tab looks
in MD now. An inactive tab would have no icon or close button, thus shaving
that few precious pixels off.

Mike, I realize that the icon should tell you what type of file it is, but
except for .cs files which are open most of the time I haven't really seen
too many icons. Moreover, showing a close button on hover will change the
width and layout of the tabs, leading to some very ugly and jerky behaviour.

Andreia: I understand your point, I did notice that clipping the title after
seven characters did make it difficult to find out what's where. How would
it be if we strip the &quot;.cs&quot; portion instead? Every pixel counts especially
on smaller monitors.

I will try to make a patch based on Andr&#233;s' suggestion. Title won't be
clipped, but icons and close buttons will be present only for active
document, so you guys can try it out.

Any other suggestions or thoughts?

Thanks,
Andy
