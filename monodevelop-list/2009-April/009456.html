&gt;<i> How about:

This is a good thing, I think.  It beats reaching for the &lt;ESC&gt; key.

&gt;<i> * make undo a bit more intelligent. For example:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;i&quot;&lt;space&gt; becomes &quot;if&lt;space&gt;&quot; now undo does : &quot;i&quot;. How about undo
</I>&gt;<i> undos it to &quot;i&lt;space&gt;&quot; ?
</I>
Another good idea, I think.

I don't think that turning it off by default is a good idea.  The
opposite issue would be that people would think it was some strange
throwback to environments that couldn't do that.  First impressions are
everything, though, so I say keep it on by default, let the user know
somehow plainly that they can turn it off if they want, and provide
knobs for things like the above two options (the &quot;undo&quot; bit, whether to
use full undo or &quot;intent&quot; based undo, I guess it could be called; and a
knob to adjust the keybinding for completion overrides).
