Agree.  I'd be fine with that solution.

I'm occasionally frustrated by code completion - but I think turning it
off by default would be a big mistake.

&gt;<i> &gt; * make undo a bit more intelligent. For example:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;i&quot;&lt;space&gt; becomes &quot;if&lt;space&gt;&quot; now undo does : &quot;i&quot;. How about undo
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; undos it to &quot;i&lt;space&gt;&quot; ?
</I>&gt;<i> Another good idea, I think.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think that turning it off by default is a good idea.  The
</I>&gt;<i> opposite issue would be that people would think it was some strange
</I>&gt;<i> throwback to environments that couldn't do that.  First impressions are

</I>
Agree, completely.

I'd be happy if I could just have code completion not guess until I'd
typed something like three characters.  I mean I just don't need &quot;if&quot;
completed from &quot;i&quot;.  I need the class name &quot;OGoJobAccessHandler&quot;
completed after I type &quot;OGoJ&quot;.

&gt;<i> let the user know
</I>&gt;<i> somehow plainly that they can turn it off if they want, and provide
</I>&gt;<i> knobs for things like the above two options (the &quot;undo&quot; bit, whether to
</I>&gt;<i> use full undo or &quot;intent&quot; based undo, I guess it could be called; and a
</I>&gt;<i> knob to adjust the keybinding for completion overrides).
</I>
Personally I fear KDE-like infinite-configurability-itis as much as I'm
annoyed by overly aggressive code completion.
