Will it just be combo boxes for revisions, or can the diff editor be
used to compare against other files as well? It's probably less common,
but it'd be useful if you could do a &quot;compare with each other&quot; on
arbitrary files and use the editor.

</I>
Even something like Beesoft use would be fairly intuitive: a cross to
cancel an addition/deletion and an arrow to copy it (so undo the
deletion, backport the addition or overwrite a change) both contained in
the change block rather than on the line (screenshots at
<A HREF="http://www.beesoft.org/index.php?id=beediff">http://www.beesoft.org/index.php?id=beediff</A>)

</I>
I did think there'd still be a few bits on the ToDo list!

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fonts are a general problem - we'll need a font selection pane for 2.6 -
</I>&gt;<i> we've other fonts the user may want to change (message bubbles/tooltips).
</I>
I think the fonts would help, and it does obviously change depending on
how your code changed - whether it was lots of large chunks (committing
small and often) or lots of huge changes and rewrites (working elsewhere
and committing to a Master).

Eclipse has a lot of font preferences that I hardly ever touch after a
first setup. Most of it just cascades through (e.g. the console and
editor inherit from a &quot;fixed width font&quot; setting or similar, then they
might have a Java Editor font that inherits from the Editor font, I
think) but the extent that they go to is potentially a bit overboard!

&gt;&gt;<i> And one suggestion that I hope is possible with the Code DOM:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Eclipse has a nice &quot;structure compare&quot; that lets you see where the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changes were made from an overview (e.g.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/523307/semantic-diff-utilities">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/523307/semantic-diff-utilities</A>). Once
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you've got the basics going then I think it'd be nice to include
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something similar, if possible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;<i> Something like that should be very easy to do.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards
</I>&gt;<i> Mike
</I>
Good to hear it - I did think that it should be do-able if you've got
some kind of DOM :)

Thanks,
