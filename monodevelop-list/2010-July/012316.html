<PRE>Hi
&gt;<i> That looks similar to Eclipse (which isn't surprising from what I
</I>&gt;<i> vaguely know of Netbeans). Each tab has a close button, the group of
</I>&gt;<i> tabs has a &quot;minimise&quot; in the spare space that groups the whole lot
</I>&gt;<i> down and then you right-click to dock a single one (at least that's
</I>&gt;<i> what I remember, but I can't test at the moment). It makes sense, and
</I>&gt;<i> I've always thought those grey bars were a bit ugly, where as using
</I>&gt;<i> the tab is more native.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Eclipse also puts an extra button in the spare space for additional
</I>&gt;<i> actions, but I think that behaviour is a bit odd as it applies to the
</I>&gt;<i> current tab, even though it's in a &quot;group of tabs&quot; area.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>The extra buttons in the space space are a nice idea, but I know what 
you mean with 'a bit odd' :)

Ok you're right - eclipse does the same. I think the pad tabs look much 
better than in netbeans.
Everyone who thinks that there is an usability problem with merging tabs 
&amp; the header should take a look at netbeans for just that issue.
Screen space is valuable - many of us like x-code - they don't waste 
space on such features like showing the obvious - all is functional.
I think we should do the same.

Regards
Mike
