<PRE>I think that's an improvement over the old one, although it still needs
the &quot;if there's only one then pick it&quot; behaviour for classes ;)

I don't use regions very much, but I think they need a bit of work. Just
to bullet my initial observations:

1) It would be nice to be able to click to show the list and click to
hide. Currently the second click hides and re-opens the list, but the
widget renders more like a toggle button.

2) Delegates seem to be handled a bit strangely. I've got one file that
just defines three delegates that I use frequently and the nav shows an
odd &quot;Invoke&quot; sub-item that I didn't expect. Is it necessary or can we
merge them to just show the delegate name with its icon.

3) If I add a region to my code then it breaks the click on the first
button (the file). Clicking on the file only shows the region as an
option, which means you can't use the nav to get to methods and classes
outside regions

4) Regions seem to show at the start of the list rather than where they
are in the hierarchy. If I put a region inside the class and put my
cursor on the class then I can't see the region in the nav, but if I
click in the region then the nav shows the region first, then the class,
then the methods of the class that are within the region.

The general behaviour of being more flexible in length and looking more
like a widget designed for a purpose instead of a bunch of widgets used
to make something approximately right (even if that is what Visual
Studio does) is definitely an improvement. The region handling is also
going in the right direction, even if it isn't quite there yet. Overall,
it looks good so far :)
