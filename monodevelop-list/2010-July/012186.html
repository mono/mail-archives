<PRE>Hi
&gt;<i> 1) It wasn't obvious which file was which. Eclipse and the other diff
</I>&gt;<i> tools that I've used (e.g. BeeDiff) tend to identify the panels as to
</I>&gt;<i> whether they're the local file or the remote file
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>I've decided putting combo boxes above the files to select the revisions 
to show - they're not implemented currently.
&gt;<i> 2) What would happen when I clicked the green blob wasn't obvious.
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps an arrow to show &quot;copy change this way&quot; for additions and
</I>&gt;<i> changes and a cross for &quot;ignore deletion&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>I'm not very good at drawing nice graphics with cairo - the blob was the 
first thing I did. I don't think that it's a good solution at all.
I'll improve this (if anyone is interrested in implementing a good 
looking solution to that - I'll gladly take contributions).
&gt;<i> 3) After I'd clicked the green blob then I couldn't undo from the diff
</I>&gt;<i> view, so if you use the diff view, reject some changes, accept some and
</I>&gt;<i> then accidentally accept/reject one that you didn't want to then you've
</I>&gt;<i> got to go back to the start.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>This is a feature on the todo list as well - to get undo working in that 
control.
&gt;<i> 4) The nav bar widgets remain in the diff view, but clicking around
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't update them (presumably because they're tied to the text view)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>The nav bar isn't connected to the diff view ... need to find out how to 
do it first. It's a bit complicated.
&gt;<i> 5) I don't know if you've changed the &quot;blame&quot; view (I never tended to
</I>&gt;<i> use it since I've not got any helpers yet, so the blame is all mine ;) )
</I>&gt;<i> but single line and two line changes look a bit cluttered. Would it be
</I>&gt;<i> better to just have the time/revision/username and show the message in a
</I>&gt;<i> tooltip on hover? Also, the font it uses for the blame isn't the same as
</I>&gt;<i> the editor, which makes the spacing even worse for me because my
</I>&gt;<i> standard text font is bigger than my editor font.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>message in a tooltip is on the todo list, but I find it useful to show 
at least a part of the commit message in the 'unused space' below the 
time/rev/username line. Some files are cluttered and then it doesn't 
look well.

Fonts are a general problem - we'll need a font selection pane for 2.6 - 
we've other fonts the user may want to change (message bubbles/tooltips).
&gt;<i> And one suggestion that I hope is possible with the Code DOM:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Eclipse has a nice &quot;structure compare&quot; that lets you see where the
</I>&gt;<i> changes were made from an overview (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/523307/semantic-diff-utilities">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/523307/semantic-diff-utilities</A>). Once
</I>&gt;<i> you've got the basics going then I think it'd be nice to include
</I>&gt;<i> something similar, if possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not being pessimistic - it's definitely a good start, I like the
</I>&gt;<i> live updates of the highlighting and it is good to integrate it with the
</I>&gt;<i> standard text editor instead of taking up another tab, but I like to be
</I>&gt;<i> thorough :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>Something like that should be very easy to do.

Regards
Mike
