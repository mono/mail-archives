<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> If you are concerned about the Checkout command, which has a special
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> meaning in git, we can change the name and use something more explicit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like &quot;Get Project from Repository&quot; or something like that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, as long as there is a way to segregate the commands. &#160;I think changing
</I>&gt;<i> the checkout command will be beneficial and will cause less confusion.
</I>
In my opinion, it's more important to map the same commands to the
same(-ish) actions across the board in MonoDevelop than anything else.
So &quot;Checkout&quot; should either be disabled or mapped to `git clone`, but
not to `git checkout`
Please don't rename Checkout to something vague, since some VCSs (e.g.
bzr) support both the concept of a svn-style checkout and a git-style
clone.

&gt;&gt;<i> I disagree with that point of view. The goal of an IDE is to simplify
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the development process. If we replicate every single git command, we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are not simplifying, we are exposing all the complexity of git.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As a user I don't want to have to deal with the complexity of git every
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> day. There are only a few commands I need to use in everyday work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (review changes, commit changes, update from repo). I want MD to take
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the correct decisions for me in order to perform those operations with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> git. In case I need to do more advanced git operations, I can always
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> open a console and use the git command.
</I>
I agree completely.

&gt;<i> I agree in simplifying the workflow with Git, but at the same time we need
</I>&gt;<i> to stay uniform with the naming in some way. &#160;I have yet to see an IDE
</I>&gt;<i> that supports Git not do the same thing.
</I>
Again, I feel like it's far more important to keep the naming
consistent within MD than between MD and Git.

Would it be useful to have a DVCS abstraction that adds things common
to the major DVCSs (bzr, git, hg)? (clone, pull, push, merge, ...)
Or is the perspective of each of those too different for a useful
amount of abstraction?

My perspective:
