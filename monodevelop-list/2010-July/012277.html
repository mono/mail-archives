<PRE>Hi Folks,

I used to have a serious problem remembering how I did certain things
with the API - (deserialization, GTK Treeviews, etc). I used to refer
to my old code, which became troublesome fast. That's why I decided to
write CodeLibrary - a snippet management system - as an AddIn for
MonoDevelop. With CodeLibrary you can quickly save some bit of code
that you're writing and share it across projects. Inspiration also
came from the Acire [1] and the Vala Code[2] efforts.

Here are a couple of screenshots of CodeLibrary in action. To create a
new snippet, simply select some text in your editor, and click the
&quot;Add&quot; button. That will automatically get pasted in to the snippet
editor.
1. The main CodeLibrary view, which is implemented as a Pad in MonoDevelop.

2. The window to enter a new snippet:

Installing:
1. If you are running a trunk build, you can put the attached .dll in
main/build/Addins/MonoDevelop.CodeLibrary
2. If you are using an installed build, you can put it in
.config/addins/MonoDevelop.CodeLibrary/
3. If you want the source, the patch can be viewed here:
<A HREF="http://patchbin.com/SU0M2W">http://patchbin.com/SU0M2W</A> It's MIT/X11 licensed and should apply
cleanly to src/

Sharing Snippets:
Originally, the focus was on sharing snippets. I'd imagined a fancy
webservice with REST based synchronization and couchdb based
replication of the snippet database, but that's all been torn down
into a much simpler and more sensible solution.
There's a folder &quot;~/.config/MonoDevelop/codelibrary/community&quot;, which
can just contain a clone of a svn/git repository of snippets submitted
by community members. Right now, I hope to finalize the format first.

Known bugs:
Lots of em

Please try it and provide feedback.

Thanks,
Anirudh
