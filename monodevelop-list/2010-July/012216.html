<PRE>The diff view is pretty cool so far. It's been *very* useful to me when
reviewing other peoples diffs and also reviewing my own before committing
them. It makes it trivial to undo accidental whitespace changes.

One feature I was thinking would be cool would be if scolling the diff view
jumped between segments, alternatively each scroll in the diff view would
move you down to the next changed line. This way you could easily jump to
the important parts of the file without having to think about it and place
your mouse in just the right place. The way I view things is that scrolling
in either the left pane or right pane will scroll as normal, but if you
scroll in the bar in the middle you should jump to the next changed
segment/line.

What do people think of this? Can you think of a better way to accomplish
this?

Alan.
