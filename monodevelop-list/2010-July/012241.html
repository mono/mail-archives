<PRE>I'm a little torn on the scrolling behaviour. It can be jumpy at times
when you've got big gaps between changes, but Eclipse does it and I have
found it useful. As the OP said, it does help you focus on the important
parts.

The main problem is normally over how much to scroll. If you've got lots
of block deletes/additions (especially ones that are larger than your
window) then scrolling in the panel that has the little blocks means you
don't see all of the changes and scrolling in the panel that has the big
blocks can seem like you're scrolling a lot for little change.

If we've got buttons then it is probably less confusing for now to just
use them for change jumping, but I'll have to check the buttons out a
bit more.
