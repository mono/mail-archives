Agreed in general with all opinions from Lluis. Just a couple of
comments inline:

El 28/07/10 20:07, Lluis Sanchez Gual escribi&#243;:
&gt;<i> El dc 28 de 07 de 2010 a les 10:41 -0400, en/na Dale Ragan va escriure:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So the Git add-in can be used pretty much like the Subversion add-in.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The only big difference is that changes have to be explicitly pushed to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the remote repository using the Push command. Feedback about how to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> improve this workflow is welcome.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I see you are finding the issues that I was faced with when I started on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this venture.  I'm glad you're back, so we can work on this together. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here are some ideas that I came up with while thinking about this feature
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> over the last month:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Since we will be shipping two version control systems out of the box now,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think it would be beneficial to set a setting on which Version Control
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> System MonoDevelop should use by default.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is not necessary because MD already detects which project is using
</I>&gt;<i> which version control system. Options shown in the context menu can be
</I>&gt;<i> specific to the version control of the project.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you are concerned about the Checkout command, which has a special
</I>&gt;<i> meaning in git, we can change the name and use something more explicit
</I>&gt;<i> like &quot;Get Project from Repository&quot; or something like that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Then when opening existing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> projects we can scan for the system being used and set this value.  This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will simplify and allow segregation of the commands and not present
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> options that are not valid based on the system being used.  This will also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> allow us to add configuration settings for the Version Control System that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the user can set.  For instance, one feature I had in mind, which looks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like you implemented an early version of, is to display the current branch
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> beside the solution name.  A configuration setting could actually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> customize the output of that string.  This would also be a good place to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> set globally the files to ignore automatically when creating a new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> repository.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This can be done without having to set a default VC system. Specific VCS
</I>&gt;<i> can extend the solution pad and customize it however they want, just
</I>&gt;<i> like I did with the branch label in the solution node.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The commands available in the context menu should be in sync with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> command line options.  This helps with uniformity and makes going back and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> forth a lot easier.  It will also enhance the workflow by presenting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> commands in a way that are already familiar with the command line and vice
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> versa.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I disagree with that point of view. The goal of an IDE is to simplify
</I>&gt;<i> the development process. If we replicate every single git command, we
</I>&gt;<i> are not simplifying, we are exposing all the complexity of git.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a user I don't want to have to deal with the complexity of git every
</I>&gt;<i> day. There are only a few commands I need to use in everyday work
</I>&gt;<i> (review changes, commit changes, update from repo). I want MD to take
</I>&gt;<i> the correct decisions for me in order to perform those operations with
</I>&gt;<i> git. In case I need to do more advanced git operations, I can always
</I>&gt;<i> open a console and use the git command.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here's a list of commands that I think should be implemented:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   File Menu
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Initialize - Create a new git repository
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We can create a new &quot;Create repository&quot; command, which can also be
</I>&gt;<i> implemented for SVN.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Clone - Clone an existing git repository
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is the Checkout command, which can be renamed to &quot;Get Project from
</I>&gt;<i> Repository&quot;, shared with SVN.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Project Context Menu
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Commit - Commit changed files to local repository allowing the user to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> check which changes to stage for the commit
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is the current Review Changes view and the Commit command.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Push - Push changes to remote repository
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This command is new and specific to Git. Ok to add it.
</I>
You could also create a new generic DistributedVersionControl class
outside of the Git addin that adds a Push abstract operation, so other
addins that inherit from it can define their own Push behavior.


&gt;&gt;<i>     Pull - Pull changes from remote repository
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Fetch - Fetch changes from remote repository
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Pull and Fetch are implemented by the &quot;Update&quot; command, so there is no
</I>&gt;<i> need to have them as separate commands.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Create Branch - Create a new branch
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Checkout Branch - Checkout an existing branch
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Merge - Merge changes from one branch to another
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We can have a branch manager for doing those operations.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Create Tag - Create a new Tag
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We can add this command.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Log - View commit log
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's the existing Log command.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Reset HEAD - Revert changes to last commit
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is a Revert command in the SVN add-in which can be generalized.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Stash - Stash changes and reverting to last commit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     UnStash - Unstash a stash object
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure we need those. MD can automatically use stash for the most
</I>&gt;<i> common operations, such as when pulling or when switching branches.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Add - Add changes files to staging
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think the concept of &quot;stagging&quot; is really useful in the IDE.
</I>&gt;<i> Stagging is useful in the command line because it allows you to select
</I>&gt;<i> what do you want to commit. But the IDE already has a GUI for selecting
</I>&gt;<i> what to commit (the review changes view), so this command is not
</I>&gt;<i> necessary.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Ignore - Add file to .gitignore
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Apply Patch - Apply a patch to current branch
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We don't have those commands, but it might be useful to have them for
</I>&gt;<i> both SVN and Git.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Create Patch - Create a patch based on last commit
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Already exists.
</I>
For this one, it would be useful to place it in another place because
now with DVCS there's another use case: you commit, and then you want to
create the patch of an already-committed-locally changeset so other
person can review it before pushing it.


&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A pad for the history view showing the commits for the current branch. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This feature will present the commits in a nice and readable format.  The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> user will then be allowed to view changes for a commit and compare.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is the Log command. This command, when executed on a directory,
</I>&gt;<i> used to show the commit history, but this seems to be broken in trunk.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A pad for managing Git repositories.  This feature will present the .git
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> directory in an easy to read and presentable way allowing management of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> remotes and branches for instance.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, although it would be a dialog, not a pad.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Of course this isn't everything probably, but just a short list of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> features that I planned on doing.  Any other thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's all!
</I>&gt;<i> Lluis.
</I>
My 2 cents!

  Andres
