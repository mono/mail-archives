<PRE>Hi
&gt;<i> 1) It would be nice to be able to click to show the list and click to
</I>&gt;<i> hide. Currently the second click hides and re-opens the list, but the
</I>&gt;<i> widget renders more like a toggle button.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>I'll look into that - seems to be a bug.
&gt;<i> 2) Delegates seem to be handled a bit strangely. I've got one file that
</I>&gt;<i> just defines three delegates that I use frequently and the nav shows an
</I>&gt;<i> odd &quot;Invoke&quot; sub-item that I didn't expect. Is it necessary or can we
</I>&gt;<i> merge them to just show the delegate name with its icon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>Ok put delegates on the list (the invoke is a method I internally 
generate for delegate types - shouldn't show up).
&gt;<i> 3) If I add a region to my code then it breaks the click on the first
</I>&gt;<i> button (the file). Clicking on the file only shows the region as an
</I>&gt;<i> option, which means you can't use the nav to get to methods and classes
</I>&gt;<i> outside regions
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>The first box just shows the regions and let's you select arbitrary 
regions - but doesn't filter the following ones (doesn't make real sense 
after trying it).

It's a bit tricky to show the regions - that's why it's a bit 
unintuitive, but I think this behavior is the best solution. If anyone 
has a better idea I would like to hear it.
&gt;<i> 4) Regions seem to show at the start of the list rather than where they
</I>&gt;<i> are in the hierarchy. If I put a region inside the class and put my
</I>&gt;<i> cursor on the class then I can't see the region in the nav, but if I
</I>&gt;<i> click in the region then the nav shows the region first, then the class,
</I>&gt;<i> then the methods of the class that are within the region.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>That's because regions are more file specific than type specific ... 
putting the regions into the type hierarchy wouldn't give a good 
overview of the regions - wouldn't it ? I prefer to have the regions 
separate for the files - is this wrong (I would like some opinions about 
that after trying out the current SVN version).
&gt;<i> The general behaviour of being more flexible in length and looking more
</I>&gt;<i> like a widget designed for a purpose instead of a bunch of widgets used
</I>&gt;<i> to make something approximately right (even if that is what Visual
</I>&gt;<i> Studio does) is definitely an improvement. The region handling is also
</I>&gt;<i> going in the right direction, even if it isn't quite there yet. Overall,
</I>&gt;<i> it looks good so far :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>Nice to hear that this is going in the right direction. The great 
strength of the new control is that it is better than the old one 
showing the current position &amp; taking less space for the same job.
I'm not 100% satisfied with it yet,  but I've some months left to 
streamline it for the 2.6 release :)
(As well as the version control file views)

Regards
Mike
