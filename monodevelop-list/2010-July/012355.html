<PRE>Hi Anirudh,
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A pad for the history view showing the commits for the current
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> branch. This feature will present the commits in a nice and readable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> format.  The user will then be allowed to view changes for a commit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and compare.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A pad for managing Git repositories.  This feature will present
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the .git directory in an easy to read and presentable way allowing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> management of remotes and branches for instance.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Of course this isn't everything probably, but just a short list of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> features that I planned on doing.  Any other thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've used many graphical tools to manage a git repository -
</I>&gt;<i> gitg, giggle, tig, magit, vim-fugitive and would like to share a couple
</I>&gt;<i> of thoughts. I would recommend you look at magit(an emacs extension),
</I>&gt;<i> and Tim Pope's vim-fugitive if you haven't already.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are a few things that all frontends to git seem to do in common:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. They present all the files that are untracked, changed, etc - and
</I>&gt;<i> ask you to pick and choose the files to stage and ignore. A user would
</I>&gt;<i> scroll through the list and hit &quot;s&quot; to stage, &quot;i&quot; to ignore and &quot;u&quot;to
</I>&gt;<i> unstage. This is similar to MD's approach where changes to stage are
</I>&gt;<i> selected using check boxes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Git commits seem to treat the entire commit as one atomic change,
</I>&gt;<i> and the commit message describes the same, as opposed to mentioning the
</I>&gt;<i> change in each specific file. Again, I guess it's a question of
</I>&gt;<i> convention rather than the norm.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In my view, a pad for managing git remotes and a history view showing
</I>&gt;<i> the commits might not be extremely useful as:
</I>&gt;<i> a) People have different ways of working with remotes. I might first
</I>&gt;<i> fetch the remote, check the diff and then merge the commits - or even
</I>&gt;<i> rebase them. Instead I might just pull changes in from them. Moreover,
</I>&gt;<i> there are plenty of great tools to do this already.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> b) History view is harder than it looks (to me at least) as there are
</I>&gt;<i> going to be branches, and it might not be a trivial implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> Again, many great
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Instead, a strong commit window with a solid keyboard workflow would be
</I>&gt;<i> a killer addin. If one can hit a keystroke to pull up a list of
</I>&gt;<i> changed/added files, selectively stage them by moving about the list
</I>&gt;<i> and hit &quot;C&quot; to make the commit, I'm sure to see productivity go up.
</I>
Thanks for the pointers and we will do our best to make sure what we
create keeps users productive.  Of course provide input as the features
become available.

&gt;<i> Also, one fantastic feature would be a prominent display of the current
</I>&gt;<i> branch that is active. Emacs and Vim display the branch in the
</I>&gt;<i> modeline, and I've had very bad muck-ups because I was making edits to
</I>&gt;<i> the wrong branch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
We added the branch name to be displayed beside the Solution Name node in
the solution tree.  For example:
    Solution1 (master)
        Project1
            File1
        Project2
        ...
        ProjectN

Thanks,

Dale

</PRE>
