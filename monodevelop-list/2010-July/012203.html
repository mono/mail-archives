</I>&gt;<i> The logical behaviour is showing the poisition ... and it does: show the

</I>&gt;<i> Example:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> int a,
</I>&gt;<i> #region B region
</I>&gt;<i> b
</I>&gt;<i> #endregion;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This could mess up the logical structure - pre processor directives are file

</I>&gt;<i> - but that doesn't mean that is the only way using it.
</I>&gt;<i> The implementation now has the advantage to QUICKLY SWITCH between all
</I>&gt;<i> regions in the file ... this is nothing what your solution could do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've thought about it and I'll just change it to :
</I>&gt;<i> [REGION] | [CLASS] &gt; ... &gt; [MEMBER]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This makes it more visible but doesn't change anything at the current
</I>&gt;<i> behavior.
</I>
While it's true that regions are distinct from the semantic structure
of the C# file, in practice they are almost always used to group
members or classes (I've never seen them used another way). Therefore,
in practice they are *effectively* part of the structure, and IMO a
breadbrumb bar should respect this. It would certainly be much for
usable for me.

&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;Why doesn't it make sense
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to replicate the outline view in the quick navigator?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because then you don't need the outline view ...
</I>&gt;<i> The quick navigator is a different control with a different purpose - it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't give you an overview of the file it shows your caret position. The
</I>&gt;<i> only thing that these two have in common is allowing to switch to a specific
</I>&gt;<i> entry in a file.
</I>&gt;<i> If we're making these two exactly the same it would be replicating a feature
</I>&gt;<i> - that's not good program design.
</I>
True, but it would be a shame to make the navigation bar less useful
simply because the outline already exists :)

If the items in the breadcrumbs menu expanded out so that one could
drill down directly from a single item, then I wouldn't need the
outline at all. And one really good feature is better than two similar
but inferior features.
