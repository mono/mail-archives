<PRE>I've been experimenting with the design extensibility in Visual Studio.  I'm
kind of curious about the plans for design extensibility in Monodevelop; I
think it'd be interesting to try and produce Silverlight controls that have
a good experience cross-platform.  I tried to experiment with it a little
bit but found there's no visual designer and the properties tool window
doesn't allow editing elements in Moonlight applications, so right now my
answer is &quot;It isn't supported.&quot;

Sharpdevelop's designer has some kind of support, but it's not following the
same model as the VS/Blend extensibility model.  I'm not sure if I can
assume that means Monodevelop will follow the same path, since it's possible
Mono could implement an implementation of the same extensibility model as
VS/Blend.  I doubt this is the case, but I'm fishing for something a little
more substantial than a guess.

I don't care if the answer involves &quot;there is no known timeframe&quot;, because
that in and of itself is a valid answer.  Can anyone help?
