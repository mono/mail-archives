<PRE>I checked Eclipse today while I was working on it, and it seems to
depend on which diff view you're working with as to whether it jumps
when you scroll. For now I think we're probably better without it and
sticking with the current behaviour of jumping to a point when you click
in the diff margin.

Just a few comments on the UI:

 1) The next/prev diff buttons are too narrow to see the icons on to
know what they do - I just see about a 2px by 2px square inside the button.

 2) It loses you a tiny amount of screen space, but I think we'd benefit
from a native scroll bar rather than the &quot;diff map that acts as a scroll
bar&quot;. At the moment it just looks odd and slightly non-obvious as to how
much you can scroll (the colours aren't obvious enough)

 3) In spite of 2), it would be useful to be able to click on a diff map
section and jump to it - perhaps only making the differing lines
clickable in the map.

 4) Having the scrollable area be the full height of the scrolling area
seems a bit more natural and easier to judge where you are.

 5) Prev/next diff buttons probably shouldn't loop. If you want to get
to the last diff using the buttons then you should be able to just keep
clicking until the button disables and it doesn't move again, rather
than having to pay attention.

 6) Changes should probably only be copied on left-click, not on
right-click as well

 7) It would be useful to have a &quot;copy all changes&quot; and &quot;copy all
unconflicting changes&quot; action available.

Hope that helps and gives people some ideas :)
