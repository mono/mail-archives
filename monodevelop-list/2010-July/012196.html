<PRE>Hi
&gt;<i> That's basically what I was thinking - to me the navigation is basically
</I>&gt;<i> an outline that you can jump through that shows a compact breadcrumb of
</I>&gt;<i> where you are.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Eclipse doesn't have to cope with regions, but they have introduced a
</I>&gt;<i> breadcrumb bar that can be very useful. One difference there is that
</I>&gt;<i> theirs is package wide, so it behaves more like the Windows Vista
</I>&gt;<i> Explorer navigation at all levels - click the namespace one and you get
</I>&gt;<i> a list of all namespaces you could look at. That's probably a slightly
</I>&gt;<i> different widget to what Mike is trying to create, though, with a
</I>&gt;<i> slightly wider scope.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>Atm this isn't really possible to do for us - but we're considering 
changing the workflow.

&gt;<i> That's still a button press or a click either way. If I've got a class
</I>&gt;<i> in a namespace with some methods in a region and some methods outside
</I>&gt;<i> and if I'm within the region but want to navigate to a method outside
</I>&gt;<i> the region then I've currently got to click outside of the region or
</I>&gt;<i> press Ctrl+Home to get to the top of the page so that I can use the nav.
</I>&gt;<i> Either of those actions is something different that I've got to do to
</I>&gt;<i> get the nav to do what I want. What I was suggesting provides the user
</I>&gt;<i> with all of the interaction they need in one place, which seems more
</I>&gt;<i> consistent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>Ok this shows me that you still doesn't fully understand how it works 
atm. You don't need to go outside of a region for navigating to a 
member/type etc.
I think I just make it more clear that the 1st box isn't a filter and 
then waiting some months for more feedback about this.
&gt;&gt;<i> I don't intend to put a different level selector in the tree - this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would complicate things too much. atm it's very clear [REGION] -&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [LOGICAL STRUCTURE].
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> If you're going to keep that structure then I still think that you need
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;no region&quot; option as soon as you have regions, and the file seems as
</I>&gt;<i> logical a &quot;no region&quot; item as any. If you don't then you end up needing
</I>&gt;<i> to either do funny navigations or deciding that everything needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> in a region.
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>No because 'no region' isn't defined clearly - jumping to the first 
point in the file where no region is is not a feature that makes sense.
Give me a use case for that. I think there isn't any - at least atm 
because it doesn't filter.

Regards
Mike
