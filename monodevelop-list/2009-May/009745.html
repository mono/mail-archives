When we add your addin to MD SVN, it'll likely have to go in extras,
but until then, if it makes things easier for you, it's fine to keep
it in main/AddIns.

The build system for extras is designed so each addin can distributed
separately and built against an installed copy of MD (though the
top-level configure script can hook them into the main build for
convenience). This is useful for addins that are incomplete or
unstable, or have a different release cycle from main MD, or bring in
large dependencies.

&gt;<i> Any suggestion on where to start for adding a new pad? Also I'll need to
</I>&gt;<i> have a look at some usage of the ExtensibleTreeView class.
</I>
The ClassPad in IDE is an example of both. Other than that, there are
pads everywhere -- for example, DesignerSupport's outline pad, or the
debugger pads. IIRC AssemblyBrowser uses ExtensibleTreeView too.
