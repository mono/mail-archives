<PRE>Hello all,
I've been using the .NET Framework from Microsoft for the past six 
years, and probably more as I can't remember exactly when I started. But 
after all these years, I finally decided to give Mono a try as 
cross-platform developments is getting more and more interesting for my 
needs and projects. Before, Mono wasn't in a state that I would consider 
enough to make the switch, for me at least, but now that C# 3.0 is fully 
supported, Linq and all, it makes a lot of sense to at least give it a 
try. And performance also seems to be on par with Microsoft offering.

And that's exactly what I'm doing, on a brand new Ubuntu Desktop install 
and Monodevelop. And this is where the problems begins :) Well, 
problems, I just need some help to get started. See, I'm a little bit 
picky on how my files are organised and I like to automate everything I 
do, as with everyone around here I guess. So I decided to create my own 
project templates. But the problem is I can't find any good 
documentation on what is available on .xft.xml and .xpt.xml files. The 
only things I found are looking at Monodevelop sources and play trial 
and error. Maybe I'm just plain stupid and can't find the obvious, or 
maybe it just very well hidden, but either way I need some help. Anyone 
knows or has some documentation on these files? A schema maybe?

Thanks and looking forward to contribute on this project.

Etienne Fortin
