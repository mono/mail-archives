<PRE>Hi

&gt;<i> And it will be possible to disable it? I find it very annoying. :/
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
To make a long story short: I've just added an option for it. 

We've already gone the fine granular option route in other cases. I
don't see why we shouldn't make an option here too. Especially if one
really wants it - it's not a theoretical option, it's a requested one :)

I personally won't turn it off. I really like the aggressive code
completion. I've looked at my typing behavior a bit and I must tell I
don't press ESC after a few letters. I don't jump much around. But this
as a personal working style. I can understand that someone finds this
type of completion annoying (even if I don't share the same feelings
about it).

An option there doesn't hurt. You find it on the general text editor
panel right below the &quot;enable code completion&quot; option. I want that as
many as possible people feel comfortable with monodevelop. If anyone
wants an option or special behavior don't hesitate to ask for it, we'll
try to implement it. 

Regards
Mike
