</I>&gt;<i> We may need to extend the interfaces in order to expose more

</I>
I'll look into it. One thing I'd love to see is a &quot;bisect&quot; command
from within the IDE. That's one of those things that would make the
first IDE implementing it simply sell itself to hackers and suits
alike. Besides, &quot;bisect&quot;, once learned, is such an awesome tool that
coders will start to adapt their workflow just to get full benefit
from it.

&gt;&gt;<i> So in an effort to learn C#, I've decided to play along with this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (hopefully with some help from the MonoDevelop team), but it seems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to me that the best place to start is the fledgling libgit2 and link
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that with git-sharp. The primary reason for this is ofcourse that I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think it'd be a terrible waste to have yet another from-scratch
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementation of git in a new language (ruby, java, C#, C...). The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> secondary reason is that it would be neat to have more OSS projects
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use my favourite scm.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's actually one of the reasons we'd like a full managed
</I>&gt;<i> implementation --it'd be trivial to include to with cross-platform
</I>&gt;<i> Mono-based apps without worrying about architecture, C dependencies,
</I>&gt;<i> etc. For example, Tomboy could use git to store its notes, so users
</I>&gt;<i> would have a versioned history and better synch/merge. Then, for
</I>&gt;<i> example, you could build a Silverlight version that would have full
</I>&gt;<i> history in local storage.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
What's considered &quot;unmanaged&quot;? (remember I'm a C# newbie here). Is it
stuff marked as &quot;unsafe&quot;? If so, there's a whole platoon of stuff to
re-implement, which is quite nuts. Iiuc, a &quot;safe&quot; way of implementing
unmanaged code is to always write to objects passed as parameters in
libgit2, like so:

    int git_commit_get(git_commit *commit, git_oid *oid);

instead of

    git_commit *git_commit_get(git_oid *oid);

as one can let git_commit be a class that gets instantiated and also
gc'd the normal way. libgit just has to make sure not to leak memory
and avoid side-effects, but that's good library design anyways, so
it's not as if C# integration would hurt libgit design.

I really think this would be a better approach that could make the C#
implementation stay on top of new features (such as the up-and-coming
v4 pack) a lot better than writing it from scratch.

libgit2 is intended to be portable to all unices as well as Windows
and Mac OS X, so there's no real problem there

&gt;&gt;<i> Besides, getting something to rely on libgit2 early on is probably
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the best way to get more people interested in making development of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it proceed rapidly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thoughts anyone?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I hadn't heard of libgit2 (it looks pretty recent)
</I>
It is.

&gt;<i> but it looks
</I>&gt;<i> interesting -- at least stable APIs would no longer be a worry.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I think fully managed is the way to go, from the point of
</I>&gt;<i> view of much easier dependencies (on windows, mac, silverlight and
</I>&gt;<i> older linux distros) and licensing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
But who's going to write (and separately maintain) the 50k or so LoC
that will make up the git core lib in C#? It really is a waste of
resources, imo. Especially since libgit will get a lot of exercise,
whereas the C# code will get that of C#-based integrations only. I
have a feeling this would lead to bugs (or limitations) in the C#
implementation that the git community would be expected to deal with.
