These questions are all unrelated to winforms, and more appropriate to
the monodevelop mailing list. I'm moving the discussion there.

&gt;<i> oke, it installed it( it seems that it can handle microsft express

</I>&gt;<i> get fixed. like develop a user interface. MS &gt; just drop all the

</I>&gt;<i> in monodevelop I cant get i done, cant resize objects some messages
</I>&gt;<i> about widgets (what is that?) and Gtk# shizzle?
</I>
MonoDevelop does not have a Winforms GUI designer. The GUI designer uses
the GTK+ toolkit (the .NET bindings are called GTK#). &quot;Widget&quot; in GTK+
is the same as &quot;control&quot; in Winforms. If you Google a bit I'm sure you
can find plenty of documentation, tutorials, etc. Layout in GTK+ works
differently; you don't generally absolutely position your widgets.
Instead, they go in containers and resize relative to each other and
according to properties that you set. It actually ends up working a lot
nice for a lot of cases (don't you get tired of resizing your Winforms
buttons whenever you change the text on them, for example?).

&gt;<i> So there are a lot of beginners problems so my question is: are there
</I>&gt;<i> some tutorial from people who switched from microsoft studio express
</I>&gt;<i> to monodevelop, or just tutorials that explains how i have too use
</I>&gt;<i> monodevelop.\?
</I>
Have you tried searching at all, or just browsing the MonoDevelop
website? There are tons of tutorials, such as this one:

&gt;<i> little extra question: if i made a Monodevelop project. and i save
</I>&gt;<i> it. and i went to school and plug my Harddisk in a M$ system with
</I>&gt;<i> microsoft visual studio C#, am i able to edit and work on this
</I>&gt;<i> project or is ms visual C# not able to handle monodevelop solutions?
</I>
MonoDevelop can use Visual Studio solution/project files. So if you use
that format (.sln/.csproj instead of .mds/.mdp), you should be fine.
However, Visual Studio has no GTK# GUI designer, so you won't be able to
edit your GUI in Visual Studio.
