&gt;<i> Hello Michael,
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your quick answer. Unfortunetly you gave me the answer I feared,
</I>&gt;<i> but I understand. There are so much tasks to complete in these projects that
</I>&gt;<i> documentation sometimes suffer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I got started looking at the current templates in the source distribution of
</I>&gt;<i> MD 2.0 Alpha 1 (strangely enough named 1.9.something). What I would like to
</I>&gt;<i> do, for now, is the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Include non compilable files in the directories tree of a project (like
</I>&gt;<i> bmp, png, key files, xml, etc...). Right now every time I include a file, it
</I>&gt;<i> gets compiled and I need to manually remove it from the compilation list.
</I>&gt;<i> Probably something like &quot;Compile=&quot;False&quot;&quot; on the &lt;File&gt; tag, but hard to
</I>&gt;<i> find it just by trying various possibilities...
</I>
You can set the BuildAction of a file in the template (take a look at
the AspNetAddin or Moonlight templates). MD trunk supports arbitrary
BuildAction values (for MSBuild compatibility), though only some of
these are actually respected by MD's build system.

I also recently overworked the default build actions in trunk, so
projects automatically set a good default build action for files that
do not have one explicitly specified. Compileable files are added with
the &quot;Compile&quot; build action; other files are added as &quot;None&quot;. The
ASP.NET project overrides this to set it to &quot;Content&quot; for web files.

&gt;<i> 2) Add custom commands. I used a pyton script with Visual Studio 2008
</I>&gt;<i> Express that automated the namespace naming based on the directory source
</I>&gt;<i> tree (ie where the source file is located in that tree). Right now I need to
</I>&gt;<i> add the custom command manually after the project is created. I would like
</I>&gt;<i> it to be put in there by the template. I guess it must go in the &lt;Options&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> tag of a project, but I can't figure out what value to put in there.
</I>
I don't think custom commands can be added by templates,
unfortunately. Could you file an enhancement bug?

For this specific thing though, there's a checkbox on the project
options that sets the namespace for new files based on the directory
name.

&gt;<i> 3) Linked to 1), but instead of adding files based on templates, add files
</I>&gt;<i> residing in the directory of the template. Useful for what I want to do in
</I>&gt;<i> 1). Something like &lt;File path=&quot;myfile.some_extension&quot;/&gt;
</I>
You can currently link other file templates, but not arbitrary files.
This might be a useful feature. Could you file an enhancement bug?

&gt;<i> FYI, my templates are all based on the CSharpBindings addin, meaning that I
</I>&gt;<i> reuse the same DLL so the same code is run behind.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I sure will look at documenting what I find out with Templates. I'll let you
</I>&gt;<i> know.
</I>
Thanks!
