The monowin32 Forge project is long dead, as Mono ships Windows
support directly. However, as you have noticed, there are a couple of
gaps. It's currently not easy to get MonoDevelop to run on Windows,
and we haven't really put resources into this port as there are other
good .NET IDEs on Windows.

You can build apps in Visual Studio, and use the resulting binaries on
Mono (with some caveats: e.g. don't use WPF or WFC). One of the Summer
of Code students last summer wrote a tool to make it possible to test
your app in Mono directly from VS (see
<A HREF="http://jpobst.blogspot.com/2008/09/hack-week-3.html">http://jpobst.blogspot.com/2008/09/hack-week-3.html</A>).

I believe SharpDevelop (from which MonoDevelop is originally derived)
has built-in support to run your apps using Mono.

If you need a GTK# for Microsoft's .NET (for example, so you can
develop GTK# from within visual studio), for now I suggest the
Medsphere release (<A HREF="http://medsphere.org/projects/gtksharp/">http://medsphere.org/projects/gtksharp/</A>), which is
the most up-to-date.
