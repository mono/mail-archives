I kinda followed the last few weeks via your svn repository (which was not 
helped by the commits being a complete mix of the individual projects).

I was a bit disappointed that nobody asked things on the Git mailing list; 
quite a number of very important lessons were learnt during the first 
implementation of jgit, and you guys could have benefitted tremendously by 
hearing them.

By the time I got aware of your effort, it was too late; for example, the 
code already relied on the fact that every blob's contents were read into 
memory at once (IIU the code correctly).

Note: personally, I do not like C# all that much, so I am not that 
interested in the port myself.  However, we get quite a number of 
questions in that direction (&quot;do you support .NET yet?&quot;), so I am quite 
interested to know what's available.

May I suggest respectfully, that the next time communication channels 
between the Mono-mentor and at least one knowledgable Git guy are 
established early in the project?  IIRC there was a GSoC project to 
reimplement Git in C# last year, too, which failed, too.

Ciao,
Dscho
