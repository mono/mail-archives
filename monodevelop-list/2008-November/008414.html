</I>&gt;<i> maybe it just very well hidden, but either way I need some help. Anyone

</I>
Unfortunately we haven't had the time to document the format. There
isn't a straightforward schema either, since the interesting elements
are provided by extensions. I'd recommend looking at existing
templates that do what you want to do.

I suggest looking at existing templates. Probably the best one is
OpenOfficeSamples
(<A HREF="http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/viewvc/trunk/monodevelop/extras/OpenOfficeSamples/">http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/viewvc/trunk/monodevelop/extras/OpenOfficeSamples/</A>)
since it's an addin consisting only of templates. There are also a
number of undocumented substitutable variables (filname, classname,
etc) and these vary with template file type :-/

It's currently not possible to add templates without an addin file,
though I do think this is something that should be make easier for MD
2.0 (maybe we should load templates directly from
~/.config/MonoDevelop/Templates, and document the template format?).

Fortunately the addin file is pretty straightforward to work out from
existing .addin.xml files. Just drop it and the associated templates
into a subdirectory of ~/.config/MonoDevelop/addins (IIRC).

&gt;<i> Thanks and looking forward to contribute on this project.
</I>
Thanks for letting us know of your interest! If you have any
suggestions for improving the user experience with templates, please
file &quot;enhancement&quot; bugs on the bug tracker. If you'd like to start off
by documenting your template experiences on the MD wiki, email me and
I'll set you up with an account :-)
