<PRE>I am once again trying to build on OpenSolaris, and running into the 
same problem I had before regarding the configure script.  I am 
wondering if this is happening on other platforms as well, but maybe the 
problem doesn't surface for some reason.

Anyhow, the problem is when Makefiles are generated and Mono.Addins.dll 
and Mono.Addins.Gui.dll references are needed I get this (specific 
snippet is from main/src/addins/MonoDevelop.GtkCore/Makefile, but there 
are many):

...
MONODOC_LIBS = /r:/opt/mono/lib/mono/monodoc/monodoc.dll
MONO_ADDINS_CFLAGS =
MONO_ADDINS_GUI_CFLAGS =
MONO_ADDINS_GUI_LIBS =
MONO_ADDINS_LIBS =
MONO_ADDINS_SETUP_CFLAGS =
MONO_ADDINS_SETUP_LIBS = 
-r:/opt/mono/lib/mono/mono-addins/Mono.Addins.Setup.dll
...

I end up manually changing as the build fails due to missing references 
to this:

...
MONO_ADDINS_GUI_LIBS = 
-r:/opt/mono/lib/mono/mono-addins/Mono.Addins.Gui.dll
MONO_ADDINS_LIBS = -r:/opt/mono/lib/mono/mono-addins/Mono.Addins.dll
...

Some of course do not require both libs but it's easier to just do both 
each time.

configure does detect the presence of Mono.Addins when it runs, and the 
really odd part is that the Mono.Addins.Setup.dll reference is correct. 
  I have not been able to figure out why this is happening, however, I 
am definitely not an autotools expert and if anyone has a clue to pass 
along I would like to explore this further, and fix it if possible.

Thanks, Zak
