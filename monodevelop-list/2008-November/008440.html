I'm glad you're interested :-)

We do have an interface in MD for integrating VCS providers, and
although the only existing one is SVN, I believe some users are
working on bzr and perforce addins. I'd prefer to see git get
established as the default (D)VCS ...

Currently, to implement  a VCS provider one needs to subclass
VersionControlSystem, as demonstrated by the SVN provider:
<A HREF="http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/viewvc/trunk/monodevelop/main/src/addins/VersionControl/MonoDevelop.VersionControl.Subversion/MonoDevelop.VersionControl.Subversion.addin.xml?view=markup.">http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/viewvc/trunk/monodevelop/main/src/addins/VersionControl/MonoDevelop.VersionControl.Subversion/MonoDevelop.VersionControl.Subversion.addin.xml?view=markup.</A>
We may need to extend the interfaces in order to expose more
DVCS-specific features, but I think it's best to find and fix these as
needed rather than speculatively implementing things.

&gt;<i> So in an effort to learn C#, I've decided to play along with this
</I>&gt;<i> (hopefully with some help from the MonoDevelop team), but it seems
</I>&gt;<i> to me that the best place to start is the fledgling libgit2 and link
</I>&gt;<i> that with git-sharp. The primary reason for this is ofcourse that I
</I>&gt;<i> think it'd be a terrible waste to have yet another from-scratch
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of git in a new language (ruby, java, C#, C...). The
</I>&gt;<i> secondary reason is that it would be neat to have more OSS projects
</I>&gt;<i> use my favourite scm.
</I>
That's actually one of the reasons we'd like a full managed
implementation --it'd be trivial to include to with cross-platform
Mono-based apps without worrying about architecture, C dependencies,
etc. For example, Tomboy could use git to store its notes, so users
would have a versioned history and better synch/merge. Then, for
example, you could build a Silverlight version that would have full
history in local storage.

&gt;<i> Besides, getting something to rely on libgit2 early on is probably
</I>&gt;<i> the best way to get more people interested in making development of
</I>&gt;<i> it proceed rapidly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thoughts anyone?
</I>
I hadn't heard of libgit2 (it looks pretty recent) but it looks
interesting -- at least stable APIs would no longer be a worry.
However, I think fully managed is the way to go, from the point of
view of much easier dependencies (on windows, mac, silverlight and
older linux distros) and licensing.
