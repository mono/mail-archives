Seems to be a running theme, lets get some more opinions, but thats
looking like where we might be leaning :)

Sorry I was unclear here, we have always planned on embedding monodoc
components for documentation browsing, the question was more geared
towards application help :)

This is most likely a Parser bug, we are finding a lot of these, I'm not
100% sure why, you should be able to isolate this down to a single file,
and then down to a small code snippet, if you could do that and file a
bug, it would help us a lot :)
