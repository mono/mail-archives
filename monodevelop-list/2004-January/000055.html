<PRE>All,
I couldn't agree more with the thought that MonoDevelop on Windows 
would end up being wasted effort. Those people using and developing on 
windows have the options that Todd mentioned. It makes far more sense 
to finally deliver a complete IDE on Gnome. All the better that its 
showing the work that the Mono community has done and the potential 
benefits to Gnome users every where.

I also feel strongly that MonoDoc meets 99.5% of the requirements that 
most developers have for documentation. Its robust and easy to use. No 
need to reinvent that wheel in my opinion.

Finally, is anyone seeing a problem opening a Combine. I was receiving 
an unhandled exception in 
ICSharpCode.SharpRefactory.Parser.AST.PrimitiveExpression that would 
cause MonoDev to crash upon opening a combine. Adding the correct 
try/catch solves the problem. I'm running gtk# HEAD and mono daily 
1.13.2003.

Thanks.
