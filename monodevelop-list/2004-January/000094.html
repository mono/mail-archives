<PRE>Hello,
	There has been some discussions about the current performance of the
text editor control on irc.  I thought it would be useful to mention
some of the ideas here so everyone is aware of them, they are not lost,
and we can proceed further.
	First, there is a few notes in samples/MonoPad/TODO, and a couple bugs
in bugzilla.  The main reason it is slow is because we are not taking
advantage of Pango attributes when we draw the text.  There is also many
posts on gtk-app-devel-list about pango performance which we should take
into consideration, and looking at some of the existing gtk/pango text
widgets should help.
	It is also possible that we could rework the text widget to use
gtksourceview-sharp to handle the text drawing, but I'm not sure that
will be faster than the current method.  Ben has looked into this some I
think and perhaps he will follow up with some more thoughts.
	Finally, I don't think that me or Todd have time to do this right now,
so unless Pedro is interested in it, I think it would need to wait until
the initial porting is complete.  However, if someone else is so
inclined that would be great, just try and announce your plans here.

Thanks,
John
