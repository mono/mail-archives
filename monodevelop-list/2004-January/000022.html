<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> IMO it's really good to integrate all those softwares in MD, but i think
</I>&gt;<i> you should consider the process as a component integration: in the end
</I>&gt;<i> .net is just about components.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not looking at bonobo, here bonobo is useless, the object model is
</I>&gt;<i> .net
</I>&gt;<i> I'm speaking about treating monodoc, mono-debugger, nunit-gtk, perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> sql# as components that can be plugged inside MD or can be run alone.
</I>&gt;<i> To see an example consider msdn browser, it runs inside vs or as a
</I>&gt;<i> standalone application (I guess it's the same code maybe it's not).
</I>&gt;<i> Ultimately I see that the experience from bonobo can helps a lot.
</I>
Absolutely.

monodoc and nunit-gtk have their own UIs today, and we will have to
find a way of hosting them in MonoDevelop.

But the debugger does not, and I am having trouble doing a UI only for
it.  So this is the perfect match.

Notice that the debugger will still be available as a class library and
as a command line tool, so others can still develop different
interfaces (graphical or not).

Miguel.
