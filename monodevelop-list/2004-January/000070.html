</I>I think there may be somewhat of a misunderstanding here, and since we
haven't decided yet what I'm about to say may be wrong as well.  When we
say use Gnome/Linux features this is actually a relatively small part of
the codebase.  Much of it can continue to be shared very easily between
the projects.  So its really a choice of implementing our specific parts
with Gtk only, or more deeper with Gnome, etc.  The SharpDevelop team
really did do a great job not tying the whole thing in to SWF and
Windows-isms.  If any of them are here, I say thank you.

We don't plan on being uncooperative here.  If sharing fixes becomes a
problem, we can solve it but for now I don't think it will be.
