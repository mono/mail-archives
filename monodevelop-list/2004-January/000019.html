<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> So my request/suggestion is that MD should keep in contact with martin
</I>&gt;<i> to create a pluggable gui and a working debugger.
</I>
Yes, I think we will be doing that.

As someone pointed out, I commented on this on my blog already:

Mono Develop
pedro, tberman and jluke have made a tremendous amount of progress on
their effort to port SharpDevelop from Windows.Forms to Gtk#. They got
intellisense working, the shell and are now porting the various smaller
dialog boxes, which is a great sign of the progress, in only three
weeks. 

Martin has been improving the reliability of the debugger. The debugger
is made up of a core API and various &quot;interfaces&quot; to it. The only one
working today (the others have bit-rot) is a bizarre command line
language. 

Before I went on vacation, I was debating what to do about the UI for
the Mono Debugger, I thought we should write a new debugger by pulling
as many nice widgets from the gIDE/Anjuta efforts and redo the debugger,
but now with MonoDevelop being available it only makes sense to
integrate the debugger directly into the IDE instead of creating a new
UI just for the debugger, and we get to reuse syntax coloring,
intellisense and the other SharpDevelop shell features. 

Once MonoDevelop matures a bit more, it will make sense to also do port
the code coverage GUI to it, implement a GUI for the profiler and move
Gtk-NUnit# to it.
