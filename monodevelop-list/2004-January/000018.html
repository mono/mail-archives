<PRE>Thanks for the reply, Todd. I appreciate the brief history. :)

In summary, then, the _basic_ idea is to port the User Interface of #Develop 
from SWF to Gtk#, and allow for Mono (read Mono/.NET/DotGNU/etc...) to be 
used as the runtime, thus making a cross platform, .NET IDE.

</I>&gt;<i>Hey,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>	I addressed Chris' email just a minute ago, but I feel this is worth a
</I>&gt;<i>response as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Comments inline.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This morning Chris asked a question about which platforms/runtimes the 
</I>&gt;<i>IDE
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be targeted at - I have some basic questions too. I think a good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; solution would be to have some sort of mission statement. Answers to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; questions, such as the following, would go a long way towards focusing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; efforts and clearing confusion (not to mention introduction to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; project...):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * What is the main purpose of the project?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Basically, to provide a usable IDE for C# developers running on any .net
</I>&gt;<i>platform using Gtk# as the toolkit (great crossplatformability (hah, is
</I>&gt;<i>that a word?))
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Secondary to this is to provide a platform for other components sorely
</I>&gt;<i>needed (a mono debugger gui tiein, a nice gtk# aware forms designer,
</I>&gt;<i>etc, etc).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Just as a brief bit of history:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Initially when miguel and I were speaking about this project, we quickly
</I>&gt;<i>realized we had two basic ways to go. 1) Start from scratch 2) Port
</I>&gt;<i>existing work. We quickly abandoned starting from scratch (although, I
</I>&gt;<i>will admit, the idea did appeal to me in a sick twisted sort of way ;)
</I>&gt;<i>). Now, once we realized we were heading down the Porting aisle, we
</I>&gt;<i>looked at our available options. We had a couple 'known' requirements at
</I>&gt;<i>that point:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>#1) Must use Gtk# (We both felt more comfortable with it, and thats just
</I>&gt;<i>our preference).
</I>&gt;<i>#2) Must be in C# (duh).
</I>&gt;<i>#3) Must be as crossplatform as possible (Why restrict our audience?).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>We felt that porting #D over say, extending/porting anjuta or any other
</I>&gt;<i>existing C gtk+ linux gui, would be a far easier and more manageable
</I>&gt;<i>task, as the core logic is quality C# no matter what toolkit you stick
</I>&gt;<i>on top of it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>After examining all of these options, we decided to try to port over
</I>&gt;<i>just the text editor widget from SWF to Gtk# as a test to see what kinda
</I>&gt;<i>ride we were getting into. Miguel then left for his brazilian vacation
</I>&gt;<i>and another hacker, pedro joined me in the port. We made pretty quick
</I>&gt;<i>progress and by the time miguel even found an internet connection down
</I>&gt;<i>there, we were pretty heavy onto the idea of porting #D.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Who is the IDE targeted at, primarily?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Everyone who might need an IDE.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * What main features should it incorporate?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>That is something that needs to be addressed by the users as well as the
</I>&gt;<i>developers over the next little bit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I realise it's still pretty much early days, and the answers to these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; questions are likely to change as the project develops. While they are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; current (and the answers well thought out), these kinds of documents can 
</I>&gt;<i>be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; really useful.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I guess my interest lies in the development of the Website, but this 
</I>&gt;<i>sort of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information should prove useful to all. Todd, I'll mail you regarding 
</I>&gt;<i>the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Website.
