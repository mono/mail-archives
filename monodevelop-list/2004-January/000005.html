<PRE>Hi!

I'm new to the list (as I guess we all are), and I have a
feature-request/suggestion.

The feature would apply to the text-editor/internal buffer handling.

The suggestions is made without any knowledge of the current internal
structure of #D or MonoDevelop (perhaps it's already there?).

In lack of a better description, I call the feature &quot;virtual buffers&quot;,
which basically means that instead of just being able to edit buffers
that map to physical files, the editor allows you to treat part of
another buffer as a buffer (subbuffer), or multiple other buffers as a
single buffer (a superbuffer).

Typically, the structure would look like this:

                  IBuffer
                  /  |  \
                 /   |   \
                /    |    \
               /     |     \
 PhysicalBuffer  SubBuffer  SuperBuffer

The Window to the developer is through the IBuffer interface, which
presents all kinds of buffers ~similarly.

Examples of use:
================

The introduction of virtual buffers opens up for a number of
possibilities when it comes to enhancing the convenience editing files.
Here are some examples.

Search/replace:
---------------
When loading a project, provide a superbuffer containing all files in
the project. This allows you to do simple project-wide search/replace
without coding specifially for this kind of functionality in the IDE;
search/replace-operations would go directly on the superbuffer.

.hpp/.cpp-synchronization
-------------------------

If you're (God forbid) working with a language like C++, imagine opening
just &quot;class&quot; instead of &quot;class.hpp&quot; and &quot;class.cpp&quot;. The IDE
automatically opens the hpp and cpp files for you, and provide three
buffers; &quot;class&quot; (superbuffer), &quot;class.hpp&quot;, &quot;class.cpp&quot;. Now, while
editing the &quot;class&quot; superbuffer, pressing &quot;M-&lt;&quot;/Home/&quot;take me to the top
of the document&quot; will take you to the top of class.hpp, while pressing
&quot;M-&gt;&quot;/&quot;End&quot;/&quot;take me to the bottom of document&quot; will take you to the
bottom of class.cpp. The two files will edit as one in the superbuffer,
keeping the need to repeatedly change buffers to get an overview of a
class to a minimum. The view in the editor should graphically indicate
the end of one physical buffer and the introduction of another in the
superbuffer-view, but it should be a simple CUP/CDOWN for the caret to
move over one; they should have no impact except visual. As above, a
search/replace would apply to both the .hpp and .cpp-file if done in the
superbuffer.

This could also come in handy if editing a class that implements many
interfaces; to be able to keep the interface-definitions &quot;at the top of
the file&quot; for reference.

Documentation writing
---------------------

I'm currently trying to participate in the monkeyguide documentation
project, and frequently find myself mixing HTML (which is the canonical
documentation format) and C#. 

This usually starts out as C# directly in the HTML, embraced by &lt;pre
class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;-blocks, but after a while my conscience urges me to try to
actually compile the code to make sure the stuff works. It starts out as
a couple of

$ cat &gt; testcode.cs
[Paste with RMB]

..and then I keep editing in the HTML-file to add more features as I go
along. This becomes boring, stupid, and I kick myself in the teeth for
being too lazy to open testcode.cs itself in emacs and then re-inserting
the code when I'm happy with it.

Now, what I really want to do is:

&lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
// ---------------------------        &lt;-- Indicate start of subbuffer
// My little C#-program
// ---------------------------

                                      &lt;-- Indicate end of subbuffer
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then scoot on over to the subbuffer and edit the C#-code. The subbuffer
will then enable C#-mode instead of HTML mode at my command.

When I edit the subbuffer, I am _really_ editing the buffer that the
subbuffer is a part of, it just doesn't get in my way. I should of
course also be able to save the subbuffer as &quot;testcode.cs&quot;, compile this
code (from the shell or from the IDE), but when I'm done, both buffers
are magically in sync, and I go on with my documentation without any
reinsertion.

It would also be nice to be able to keep a different editor &quot;mode&quot; on
the subbuffer when looking at the superbuffer, to get correct
syntax-hiliting and indenting, etc.

More
----

It's not hard to think of more examples where this feature would be
handy.

Cheers,
