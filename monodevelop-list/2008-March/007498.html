<PRE>- You can change the targetted runtime - 1.1, 2.0, Silverlight 1.1 -
by right-clicking on the project name in the Solution tab, and going
to General -&gt; Runtime Options.

- You can refresh your project file list by right-clicking on the
project name, and selecting Display Options -&gt; Refresh. This can be
handy if you use the Version Control Addin and you update / commit any
of your files externally and need to refresh their updated status
inside MonoDevelop.

- If you need to use an external assembly in your project, you can
just add a reference to it by right-clicking on References and
selecting it from either: the list of assemblies registered in your
system; a list of projects that are currently loaded in MonoDevelop;
or any assembly that exists on your filesystem.

- You can control how a file is treated in your project, whether it is
included in the build, embedded as a resource, included in deployment,
or ignored yet still be included in the file list. To change these
options for each file, open the Properties tab by going to View -&gt;
Properties, and select the file you want from your project file list.
You can then select how the file is treated by changing the Build -&gt;
Build Action option the the Properties tab.

- You can add new or open existing Solutions inside other Solutions,
so you can partition your work accordingly.
