<PRE>Note: this is a repost of what appeared to be a somewat bugged thread. I
posted before subscribing; after subscribing, the thread still was awaiting
mod approval to be posted. Therefore, I confirmed a thread delete and
started a new one :). Apologies for any inconvenience

I just got started using this, so I'm fairly new. I've only been coding
c-sharp for about 3 months as well. My main problem is understanding how the
default frameworks operate within the IDE. 

Example: how much of the original .NET is incorporated with MonoDevelop?
When transitioning from V.S. 2010, which I think had .NET v4, it made things
a little strange for me. For example, on the &quot;on-the-fly&quot; code pop-up-window
in Mono, I found that every time I would just want to reference a &quot;Type&quot;
class for an object, it wouldn't display in the menu, and would simply
automatically choose something else from the menu's selection. This makes me
wonder if I can even do this in Mono, because in V.S. it was always apparent
that if the listing wasn't in the menu, you couldn't use it in that
particular situation.   

If this is the case, are there any class libraries I can download which
anyone else is aware of, which implement similar functionality, AND also
give me something similar to what was in .NET v4? I'd really like to be able
to use MonoDevelop, but I can't if I'm not able to even use one of the most
crucial class identifiers in C#. 

Anyway, any advice or understanding on this would be appreciated. Also, I've
tried to look up how to install and import class libs (or .dlls) to
MonoDevelop, and unfortunately I really don't know how to do this. I've
messed around with the Add-In interface, and haven't really found it useful
for what I'm hoping to do, which is simply download class-libs and import
them into my code (or the entire IDE, if that's possible). 

Thanks for any help. I am quite new to programming, so apologies if I didn't
quite get the proper terminology down, or I mixed up a few definitions, etc.
