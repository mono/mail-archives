&gt;<i> Note: this is a repost of what appeared to be a somewat bugged thread. I
</I>&gt;<i> posted before subscribing; after subscribing, the thread still was awaiting
</I>&gt;<i> mod approval to be posted. Therefore, I confirmed a thread delete and
</I>&gt;<i> started a new one :). Apologies for any inconvenience
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I just got started using this, so I'm fairly new. I've only been coding
</I>&gt;<i> c-sharp for about 3 months as well. My main problem is understanding how the
</I>&gt;<i> default frameworks operate within the IDE. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Example: how much of the original .NET is incorporated with MonoDevelop?
</I>&gt;<i> When transitioning from V.S. 2010, which I think had .NET v4, it made things
</I>&gt;<i> a little strange for me. For example, on the &quot;on-the-fly&quot; code pop-up-window
</I>&gt;<i> in Mono, I found that every time I would just want to reference a &quot;Type&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> class for an object, it wouldn't display in the menu, and would simply
</I>&gt;<i> automatically choose something else from the menu's selection. This makes me
</I>&gt;<i> wonder if I can even do this in Mono, because in V.S. it was always apparent
</I>&gt;<i> that if the listing wasn't in the menu, you couldn't use it in that
</I>&gt;<i> particular situation.   
</I>
That's also the case in MonoDevelop. If it didn't work for you in a particular case, that's a bug.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If this is the case, are there any class libraries I can download which
</I>&gt;<i> anyone else is aware of, which implement similar functionality, AND also
</I>&gt;<i> give me something similar to what was in .NET v4? I'd really like to be able
</I>&gt;<i> to use MonoDevelop, but I can't if I'm not able to even use one of the most
</I>&gt;<i> crucial class identifiers in C#. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, any advice or understanding on this would be appreciated. Also, I've
</I>&gt;<i> tried to look up how to install and import class libs (or .dlls) to
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop, and unfortunately I really don't know how to do this. I've
</I>&gt;<i> messed around with the Add-In interface, and haven't really found it useful
</I>&gt;<i> for what I'm hoping to do, which is simply download class-libs and import
</I>&gt;<i> them into my code (or the entire IDE, if that's possible). 
</I>
In the solution pad, right click on the References node under your project and click on Edit References.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for any help. I am quite new to programming, so apologies if I didn't
</I>&gt;<i> quite get the proper terminology down, or I mixed up a few definitions, etc.
