this would be a really nice feature to have, just haven't gotten around
to implementing it yet.

I think the tricky bit will be writing our own custom parser for this,
because:

1. my custom smart-indent parser is pretty loose, too loose to be able
to enforce style at the level we'd probably want

2. I get the feeling the parser we use for code completion (which is AST
based I think) stuff is too strict (which isn't good for re-formatting
code because the user may do it when the code is incomplete/invalid in
some way... perhaps missing using statements or a typo, a block isn't
closed, etc)


then again, perhaps I'm quite wrong about the AST parser :)


oh, and I gather that these formatting options would not be applied
on-the-fly as you type, correct? Just when you invoke a menu option...?
(that's how I recall it working in IDEs like Visual Studio, but I could
be wrong...)

Obviously we'd also want to apply these rules when inserting
auto-generated code as well (e.g. like the refactory features)
