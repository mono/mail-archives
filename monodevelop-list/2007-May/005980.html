As documented on the MD download page, you can download it from SVN with
svn co <A HREF="svn://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/trunk/monodevelop">svn://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/trunk/monodevelop</A>

You will of course need Subversion installed (&quot;sudo apt-get install
subversion&quot;).

MonoDevelop has a lot of managed dependencies, but they're all
available in Ubuntu's repositories. You can install them all at once
with &quot;sudo apt-get build-dep monodevelop&quot;, though this does install
some extra unecessary pacakges and may not be up-to-date. You may need
to enable the Ubuntu source repositories for this to work.

Next, in the monodevelop folder, run ./autogen.sh. This generates the
configure script and runs it with default arguments (you can pass
configure arguments to ./autogen.sh, but we'll come to this later).
After the configure script has run, it will give you a little summary
of the configure options: various paths, and which components are
enabled.

You can run ./configure with any arguments you want to change. The
most important is  --prefix=installprefix, though the default is
/usr/local which is usually ok. You can list all the options with with
&quot;./confiigure --help&quot;, and bash might tab-complete the options.

I recommend &quot;./configure --enable-subversion --enable-aspnet
--enable-aspnetedit&quot;.

Next run &quot;make&quot;. When this completes, you can run MD with &quot;make run&quot;
to check it doesn't have any major bugs, then install it with &quot;make
install&quot; (probably needs to be sudo'd depending where you install it).
Now you're done!

Be aware that if you enable AspNetEdit, it needs its Mozilla &quot;chrome&quot;
to be installed. This happens as part of a normal MD install, or you
can do it by running &quot;sudo make install&quot; in the
&quot;Extras/AspNetEdit/chrome&quot; directory if you want it to work with &quot;make
run&quot; but without installing MD as a whole.

To update MD from svn, run &quot;svn up&quot; in the &quot;monodevelop&quot; directory,
then &quot;make&quot; to rebuild it. Remember to check it works before
installing it; MD HEAD from svn is not always stable!

If the MD build ever breaks, try re-running autogen.sh then
rebuilding. If it still fails, try a &quot;make distclean&quot;, then autogen
again. You can check for local changes to the source with &quot;svn
status&quot;, view them with &quot;svn diff&quot;, and undo them all with &quot;svn revert
--recursive&quot;.
