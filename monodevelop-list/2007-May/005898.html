&gt;<i> Hey guys,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      For the last few weeks I have been working on porting the
</I>&gt;<i> SharpDevelop source editor to Gtk (mostly for my own gratification)
</I>&gt;<i> and finally have a working version.  I used Gtk.DotNet so that none of
</I>&gt;<i> the drawing functions had to be changed, but I think that it wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> be hard to adapt the drawing to Cairo and Pango.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      What are your thoughts on moving to a different source-code
</I>&gt;<i> editor. Some of the advantages would be 
</I>&gt;<i>      1) It's written in C# -- no need for gtksourceview-sharp bindings
</I>&gt;<i>      2) It supports features that gtksourceview doesn't -- code
</I>&gt;<i> folding, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Disadvantages would be:
</I>&gt;<i>      1) Seems like a major change to the project.
</I>&gt;<i>      2) One more thing to debug, gtksourceview is handled by another
</I>&gt;<i> team.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and I am sure there are other arguments on both sides.  Anyway, what
</I>&gt;<i> do you think? Should I continue to pursue this and try to work it into
</I>&gt;<i> Monodevelop?
</I>
At long term we'll have to switch to a managed editor if we want to
support advanced features in the editor, so I think it is good to start
looking at it.

The key question here is how many changes do you have to do in the
original SD code. If we can reuse the SD code without many changes we
can share the maintenance work on the editor so it would be less of a
problem. Also, we'd have to see if the editor is fast and responsive
enough.

Lluis.
