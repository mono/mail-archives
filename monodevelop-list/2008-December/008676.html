<PRE>Looking at adding items to the toolbox I noticed there were several
useful widgets in monodevelop-components so I added these to the
toolbox.  I want to use the folder entry widget so I dropped it into a
dialogue in my project. It seems to compile ok but when I try to open
the dialog I get

** (otpaths:3582): WARNING **: The following assembly referenced from
/home/alan/C# development/OTPaths 1.6
current/OTPaths/bin/Debug/otpaths.exe could not be loaded:
     Assembly:   MonoDevelop.Components    (assemblyref_index=10)
     Version:    1.9.1.0
     Public Key: (none)
The assembly was not found in the Global Assembly Cache, a path listed
in the MONO_PATH environment variable, or in the location of the
executing assembly (/home/alan/C# development/OTPaths 1.6
current/OTPaths/bin/Debug).

So my question is what do I have to do to get this to work?  I have used
the Monodevelop.Dock.dll with great results (congrats on that to
everyone involved in its development) I was rather hoping I could do the
same sort of thing with items from monodevelop-components so is there a
dll I can add to my project?
Thanks
Alan
