<PRE>Hey all,
 I haven't done some work in C# for quite a while, so I wanted to see if there were any new versions of Mono Develop before I got started. I just installed MonoDevelop 1.9 (beta) for Mac OS X (from <A HREF="http://ftp.novell.com/pub/mono/archive/2.0.1/macos-10-universal/1/MonoDevelop-1.9-3.dmg">http://ftp.novell.com/pub/mono/archive/2.0.1/macos-10-universal/1/MonoDevelop-1.9-3.dmg</A>), but seem to be running into an issue. Namely, whenever I try to open a file for viewing, the program hangs and then crashes. I seem to be able to create the crash in two ways: 1) if I create a new C# Console Program Solution, the system hangs while trying to open the source files and 2) if I try to open a file from the File &gt; Open menu, I get a nice crash. I can, however, open project files. When I try to open source files in those project files, I get another crash. I seem to have an issue with rendering the source files -- or creating new tabs. Something along those lines.

 Apple's Problem Report might hold a clue as to what went wrong, but I can't seem to find anything. Note that in both case 1 and 2, I get the exact same error output:

Exception Type: EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGABRT)
Exception Codes: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x00000000fffffffc
Crashed Thread: 0

Thread 0 Crashed:
0 libSystem.B.dylib 0x96171798 __kill + 12
1 libSystem.B.dylib 0x962162b4 abort + 84
2 mono 0x0012ea50 mono_handle_native_sigsegv + 208 (mini-exceptions.c:1365)
3 mono 0x0000e1cc sigsegv_signal_handler + 236 (mini.c:13441)

 In the meantime, I've tried building from source, but I just get into a web of dependency issues. 

 So my first question is, does anybody have any clue as to what could be causing this issue? The second is, does anybody know where I can find the last stable MonoDevelop.app for MacOSX?

Thanks!

Corey
