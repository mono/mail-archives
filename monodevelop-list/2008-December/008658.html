Until a couple of weeks ago, the configure step indeed reported that  
no gtksourceviewsharp was found, but you can ignore that.  
gtksourceviewsharp is not needed for MD, they wrote their own version.  
The latest versions don't mention this missing dependency, which  
avoids confusion. I don't know what happens if you install  
gtksourceviewsharp with MacPorts, never did it, as it is not required.

If you're up to it, give it another shot, and report what the issues  
are, I could have a look at it. If you don't use MacPorts for other  
stuff, I would suggest you start from scratch, removing everything  
related to MacPorts. Their website shows how to do that.
