<PRE>Ok,

I see that you are not receptive to have ASP.Net based Addins inside 
MonoDevelop. I see it as another option to the ones that do not know 
and/or do not like gtk.

To the question about if we should have a start page my anwser is that a 
start page can save a lot of time. You can ask how, and I'll give a real 
example that happens with me.

When I was coding some patches I posted, there all required me to have a 
opened file to test it. Each time I did a make &amp;&amp; make run I had to go 
to File - Recent Files - somefile.cs. This could be very shortcutted it 
MD started already with a list of all recent files and projects.

Additional features:
1- Create a new project (with a list of project types)
2- A news and updates view
3- A search system to the mailing list

Where are examples where a gtk would not be the perfect solution to show 
the info - the news, updates and search - would be better viewed in a 
web format.

</PRE>
