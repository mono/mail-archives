There is already the beginnings of an implementation of this in
MonoDevelop. However, to not conflict with existing makefiles, the
makefile created is named Makefile.SolutionName and is easily runnable
via a make.sh file created in your toplevel directory.

There are many bits and pieces missing with this method, and a lot of
work needs to be done in order to make it not suck. Also, MonoDevelop
does this in a somewhat poor way, that would basically require
reimplementation for any project that isnt C#. There is most likely a
better way to handle all of this.

dist/distcheck actions are not supported, and multi-startup solutions
are not supported.

So basically, this code exists, and is relatively usable, at least as a
starting point for a more robust solution. Any/All patches to this
functionality would be appreciated, reviewed, and most likely accepted.
