<PRE>Monodevelop began as a port of #Develop. If you want to work on Windows just
use #Develop for now. I guess I just don't understand the need for
Monodevelop on Windows. Is it because you want to use GTK+ for writing your
GUI instead of Winforms? I guess I just don't get it. Personally I use
Visual Studio.NET 2003 on Windows and MonoDevelop on Linux. On Windows you
will have the Microsoft .NET framework installed anyway. This is basically
guaranteed these days since Microsoft bundles it with so many applications
and updates these days. Since code with .NET your code is interpreted the
first time it's run you can even do all your development in Windows (if you
want). Once Mono is fully implemented you don't even have to recompile the
code to make it run under Linux as long as it's completely managed code.

That said, I LOVE Monodevelop and what it brings to Linux... I just don't
get the need for Windows support with so many options already there.
