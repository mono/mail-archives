<PRE>Guys:

I have been thinking about writing a couple of addins for MonoDevelop
for a while.

I have not done so mainly because I waited unitl the underlying
components were stable enough to use.

As a brief description of how our addins work:

The addins should &quot;attach&quot; themselves to the build button of the toolbar.

After a successful build, depending on the nature of the source file
(java or cs) the different components would be called.

I have a couple of questions and commets:

1) The most logical place to call this looks:
MonoDevelop.Services.DefaultProjectService.AfterCompile(...)

But I do not want to modify MonoDevelop. Is there an equivalent of
&quot;onBuildDone&quot; event to register with as VS .Net has?

2) The only visible change to the user are a couple of views where our
Addin could print out its messages. I am asuming that the SharpDevelop
docs should have enough to stack these against the Task view.

Is this correct?

3) Since MD can work with Java and .Net source files, would the
default code model handle this transparently?

Or MD has the equivalent of a jdt to handle the Java code model and a
&quot;.Net-dt&quot; to handle the c# code model? How do I make calls to the JVM
from MD?

4) I just installed Mono 1.0.5 and MD using Rug. I downloaded the
source tar for MD 0.50 and the readme asks to run autogen.sh but
autogen.sh is not there.

Anything that I might be missing?

Thanks a lot for your help!!
