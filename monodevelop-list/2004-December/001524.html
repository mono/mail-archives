<PRE>&gt;<i> I was thinking about how to implement a start page with mono. While
</I>&gt;<i> using gtk could one option I think that asp.ner is a better one. Like
</I>&gt;<i> visual studio.net start page we could include recent projects, some
</I>&gt;<i> options and last news/releases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My problem start with the how to make an asp.net page that can get the
</I>&gt;<i> current MonoDevelop instance properties. I'm thinking the better ways is
</I>&gt;<i> no make a new MonoDevelopXSPService addin to enable this. Anyway, I
</I>&gt;<i> still have no clue about how I could make a page to be an addin to
</I>&gt;<i> monodevelop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While a new dependency in XSP (maybe not) could be a trouble for some, I
</I>&gt;<i> think that as soon as MonoDevelop have support to ASP.net that would be
</I>&gt;<i> a must-to-have dependency.
</I>
Argh, I hate the vs.net startpage!  And I think it's a terrible idea
to require MD to run XSP and an asp interpreter at startup just for a
startpage.

I am not wholly against the concept of a startpage (that's able to be
turned off), but a gtk# panel or a html snippet generated by c# code
will more than suffice without all the extra stuff thrown on top.
Perhaps something along the lines of Anjuta's startup dialog (
