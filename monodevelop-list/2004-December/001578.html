&gt;<i> Guys:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have been thinking about writing a couple of addins for MonoDevelop
</I>&gt;<i> for a while.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have not done so mainly because I waited unitl the underlying
</I>&gt;<i> components were stable enough to use.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a brief description of how our addins work:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The addins should &quot;attach&quot; themselves to the build button of the toolbar.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After a successful build, depending on the nature of the source file
</I>&gt;<i> (java or cs) the different components would be called.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have a couple of questions and commets:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) The most logical place to call this looks:
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop.Services.DefaultProjectService.AfterCompile(...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But I do not want to modify MonoDevelop. Is there an equivalent of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;onBuildDone&quot; event to register with as VS .Net has?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
No there is not, however we would be happy to add one for you, you
should file a bug on <A HREF="http://bugzilla.ximian.com">http://bugzilla.ximian.com</A> in the MonoDevelop
component.

&gt;<i> 2) The only visible change to the user are a couple of views where our
</I>&gt;<i> Addin could print out its messages. I am asuming that the SharpDevelop
</I>&gt;<i> docs should have enough to stack these against the Task view.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is this correct?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I am not 100% sure what you mean.

&gt;<i> 3) Since MD can work with Java and .Net source files, would the
</I>&gt;<i> default code model handle this transparently?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or MD has the equivalent of a jdt to handle the Java code model and a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;.Net-dt&quot; to handle the c# code model? How do I make calls to the JVM
</I>&gt;<i> from MD?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
You can't make direct calls to the jvm (in process) in MD right now, we
have what are called Language Bindings that basically map various
features to language specific things. I believe our current java binding
is actually designed to use gcj and ivkm, but I am not 100% up on that
piece of code.

&gt;<i> 4) I just installed Mono 1.0.5 and MD using Rug. I downloaded the
</I>&gt;<i> source tar for MD 0.50 and the readme asks to run autogen.sh but
</I>&gt;<i> autogen.sh is not there.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
autogen.sh is for people using SVN, configure is what you want, however,
there have been a good number of changes since 0.5, (and 0.5.1) and I
would recommend using MonoDevelop's SVN for any new development based on
it.
