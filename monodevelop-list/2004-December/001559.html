</I>Mono as an SDK already offers a lot of things that .NET does not.  If 
parts of Mono are compatible with MS .NET and you want to use it that is 
a good thing.  I have certainly made that my most recent objective as 
you may have noticed by Prj2make Visual Studio Add-in, the Gtk# 
installers for .NET Framework SDK and Runtime and the Gtk# Referece for 
MS Help 2.0.

Perhaps what I am trying to say is that I can see my self deploying to 
platforms and shops that only do Windows 2000 and do not have .NET 
Framework.  We, the Mono community, already have a very strong showing 
in Win32 that can complement .NET Framework, but let us not confuse that 
with a &quot;need&quot; for the .NET Framework from Microsoft.  #Develop is a fine 
product but it requires .NET Framework and the #Develop team has their 
own agenda, goals and vision that may or may not coincide with the 
MonoDevelop IDE.

I for one see a strong need to have a &quot;Complete&quot; toolkit that is fully 
cross platform.  This toolkit would be MonoDoc, MonoDevelop and a lot of 
tools that we have not even written yet (Mono Community version of XLM 
Spy for example).

I can see that if folks only saw the Mono Project as a clone or second 
fiddle to Microsoft .NET there would be no need to expect innovations to 
come from Mono and the Linux/Mac OS X side of the house and to see it 
enrich the Windows platforms (Pocket PC, Tablet PC, Windows XP, Windows 
2K, Windows 2k3 and the upcoming Longhorn).
