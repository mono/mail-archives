<PRE>Hi

In the course of porting one WinMobile app to iOS we ran into some 
problems on the part of the project where we need
PInvoke on c++ library that is going to be ported. So right now I'm 
trying to do some small proof-of-concept to test
PInvoke.

I have created 3 projects:

 1. iOS app
 2. c++ static library with 2 files String.h and String.cpp. It is
    String class with single method that returns
    reversed string.
 3. c++ console app to test library...


As soon as I add package (project package in MD) to c++ console app 
(item 3) I get 93 errors (it is MacOSx).
Removing package all 3 projects compile fine.


Do I need some more extra options or is something wrong with the 
installation.

thanks

Mel
