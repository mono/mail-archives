I have the same problem.
I have 2 parallel mono installations, one just for running, one used as
a development tree. After having the problem in my run tree, I started
upgrading the development tree piece by piece to see where the problem
occurred.
No problems after the libgdiplus upgrade, but after the mono upgrade
everything stopped working and complained about the missing DLL.

I did an upgrade of everything just now and the problem is still there,
so I would think this is a mono related issue.

Someone on IRC suggested that it might be a problem of mismapped or
linked DLL's, but I have no idea why this would happen, I can't see a
significant change to required DLL's from the mono installation I had
from Thursday, to the one from Friday.

Regards,
Jensen
