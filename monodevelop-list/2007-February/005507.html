<PRE>I was wondering if anyone could outline their basic procedures when working
with additions to monodevelop.  I have it completely compiling with
./autogen --prefix=/usr/local --enable-java --enable-boo  --enable-aspnet
--enable-aspnetedit    with make and surprisingly today I opened up the
latest SVN of md and it actually compiled from within itself but what I
don't understand how to do is actually launch/work with it.  When I launch
the MonoDevelop.Startup project from MonoDevelop it pops up saying that it
couldn't load the boo binding add-in even though autogen/make compiles and
installs boobinding just fine.


So, to clarify, what i'm looking for is:
1. What commands do you use to build usually
2. If working within monodevelop, how would you tell md not to try to use an
add-in, I know how to tell it not to build.
3. How do you launch a newly compiled md from console without installing
it?  MonoDevelop.StartUp doesn't produce an executable
4. Any other tips on working on md


Thanks
