Yeah, I just worked with the auto-formatter as it was. It had a couple
of oddities, but most of the time it was usable and more of a help than
a hindrance :) I look forward to using the new one and giving a bit of
feedback once I stop editing my wife's new website and get back to some
C# coding.

&gt;&gt;<i> Personally, I think formatting should (if possible) be a project setting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as it would make it easier for developers to be consistent on a project.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As an example, all of my code uses the &quot;Method(args)&quot; and brackets on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their own lines style, while MD uses &quot;Method (args)&quot; and brackets on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> same line as the block statements (but not methods etc). If the settings
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> were per-project with a fall-back to the IDE (like the existing default
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> policies) then I'd be able to work on MD and my code without worrying
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about whether I was formatting each one correctly.
</I>&gt;<i> This IS a project setting - and always was. (with a default in standard 
</I>&gt;<i> policies)
</I>
Sorry, slight miscommunication there. I meant the auto-formatting. You
could argue that it was a developer's preference as to whether to do it
automatically or not, but from a project management point of view then
being able to force the auto-formatting could be good (which is what our
Eclipse settings do, I think - although I'll now have to double-check
that it isn't just the common preferences file we use!)

&gt;&gt;<i> In terms of available options, I think MD is fairly close to the core of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the options that Eclipse has, but a bit more boolean. Some of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Eclipse options can take numbers (like the amount of new lines to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> maintain, which is useful for pruning down gaps). Some of the other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> options are also a bit more flexible (I think it is a &quot;always, never,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when necessary&quot; option) but that might be less important.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any thoughts or opinions?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll check the eclipse stuff - the current options are only the 1st 
</I>&gt;<i> version. I've not worked much at the options - since the old formatter 
</I>&gt;<i> didn't work.
</I>
I'm sure there are other ways to do it, but I do quite like the Eclipse
layout for the editing, as well as some of the options it has. The
current MD interface is usable, but the &quot;folders&quot; grouping is a bit odd
- it stops long lists, but it also results in slightly terse names and
nesting in unusual places for &quot;item and folder&quot; lists.
