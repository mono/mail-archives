I am not very much sure about your cause, but it might be the case that
the debugger is not installed or the debugger plugin is not
installed/enabled.

On Debian/Ubuntu, Monodevelop GNU debugger and Debugger plug-in is not
installed by default if you select monodevelop from the package manager.

monodevelop shows monodevelop-debugger-gdb and monodevelop-debugger-mdb
as recommends instead of depends.

In case it is installed on a Mac version, then goto Tools&gt;Addin-manager
and expand the Debugging section. Make sure you have the necessary
addins enabled.
