<PRE>If native widgets on all platforms is what you want, you should take a 
look at wxWidgets (.NET), which does just that, unlike GTK  or QT which 
use its own everywhere.

I've seen all three, worked with wxWidgets and GTK#, and I can tell you 
that there are problems with both approaches. I personally always 
prefered wxWidgets, but I can see the advantage of GTK, with its own 
widgets. The only problem I have with that, is that GTKs design is 
always some time behind the windows design. And I don't like it when 
applications looks as if they were made 10 years ago, because people 
judge it by the way they look, not by what they are. Unfortunately, that 
one single problem is rather deadly, which is why I still prefer 
wxWidgets, although GTK is technically better...

The todo would rather be making GTK look great in comparison to native 
windows apps.
Unfortunately right now, it's the opposite: Windows apps look great in 
comparison to GTK.

I hate to say it, but as the majority of people is not too bright, the 
look is the unique selling point.
Functionality and portability, although it is recognized as a plus, 
doesn't really matter.
(Which is why I say they are not too bright.)
