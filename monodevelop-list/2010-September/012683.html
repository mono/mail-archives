<PRE>  Hi
&gt;<i> Mike has just closed Bug 595578 [1] (Allow &quot;Format Document&quot; on save) -
</I>&gt;<i> I knew he'd come round to my suggestion in the end ;) - so I thought I'd
</I>&gt;<i> start a discussion about some of the details.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I use Eclipse during the day, and while it has too many options in some
</I>&gt;<i> parts, I think the auto-formatting is really useful and well done. We
</I>&gt;<i> use it at work to ensure consistency between developers and with coding
</I>&gt;<i> standards, as well as being a lazy way to fix up white space and indent
</I>&gt;<i> issues etc. without you having to think about it.
</I>Interresting - I thought the old formatting wasn't usable at all but the 
last few days I met some people using it. I guess when using it always 
you naturally worked around it's shortcommings.
&gt;<i> Personally, I think formatting should (if possible) be a project setting
</I>&gt;<i> as it would make it easier for developers to be consistent on a project.
</I>&gt;<i> As an example, all of my code uses the &quot;Method(args)&quot; and brackets on
</I>&gt;<i> their own lines style, while MD uses &quot;Method (args)&quot; and brackets on the
</I>&gt;<i> same line as the block statements (but not methods etc). If the settings
</I>&gt;<i> were per-project with a fall-back to the IDE (like the existing default
</I>&gt;<i> policies) then I'd be able to work on MD and my code without worrying
</I>&gt;<i> about whether I was formatting each one correctly.
</I>This IS a project setting - and always was. (with a default in standard 
policies)
&gt;<i> In terms of available options, I think MD is fairly close to the core of
</I>&gt;<i> the options that Eclipse has, but a bit more boolean. Some of the
</I>&gt;<i> Eclipse options can take numbers (like the amount of new lines to
</I>&gt;<i> maintain, which is useful for pruning down gaps). Some of the other
</I>&gt;<i> options are also a bit more flexible (I think it is a &quot;always, never,
</I>&gt;<i> when necessary&quot; option) but that might be less important.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any thoughts or opinions?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I'll check the eclipse stuff - the current options are only the 1st 
version. I've not worked much at the options - since the old formatter 
didn't work.

Regards
Mike
