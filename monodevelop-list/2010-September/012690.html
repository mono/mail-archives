But that's a separate bug. If the formatter didn't have the bug then
it'd be safe to format on save. I don't want to have to &quot;format and
save&quot; each time, I want to save and know that my code is correctly
formatted. If you want to control when you format then the option can be
disabled, but I'd rather the computer did what it does best and does the
mundane tasks so that I don't have to remember them :)
