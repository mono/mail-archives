It would be nice to have a WinForms designer in MonoDevelop, some tried, but
nothing really came out. The Mono team will not do it, so it'll have to be a
community effort.

If I understoodd your WinForms / GTK idea correctly, then this is addressed
here:

About the fact WinForms looks bad on Linux, well, the solution would be to
improve the WinForms Linux theme (or make a separate one for when visual
styles are enabled?). There is already a theme engine in place and all, but
yeah, the current theme looks very similar to the old Windows classic theme,
which isn't too sexy.
