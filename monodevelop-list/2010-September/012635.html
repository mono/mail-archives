</I>I've taken a look at the repaintline() method but it wants a long as 
argument (i think it's the line number?) and i dunno where to get it.
i've tried using repaint() which accepts 0 arguments but it only 
repaints the first line.

for &quot;fixed size&quot; i probably explained myself in the wrong way, it's ok 
for the widget to fit the container, i thought there was a way to force 
it to go for a new line.
like this

00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00         ................ 
// if the widget is larger the rest of the line is blank

as it is now if the widget is larger i get more then 16 hex and this may 
lead to misunderstanding for the reader.

oh and also, i've noticed that it causes the program to freeze if i try 
to load large files, becouse thay are stored in ram and rendered all at 
once,
is there a way to &quot;seek&quot; the content? like loading only the visible part 
and discard the rest for freeing up memory?

sorry if i'm driving you mad with all these questions, but i reeeally 
like this widget and i reeeeeally searched for something like that, 
since i don't have the skill yet to code it myself . :)

Thanks in advice
Francesco
