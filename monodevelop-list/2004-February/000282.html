<PRE>&gt;<i> You might want to remove the thing about VB.NET on the first page since
</I>&gt;<i> its not accurate right now.  The tutorial is great by the way.  If you
</I>&gt;<i> get a chance maybe you could add a FAQ page with the info from
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop/FAQS and MonoDevelop/README and whatever else you think
</I>&gt;<i> deserves a FAQ entry.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another idea would be to have a nice pretty roadmap, but we don't really
</I>&gt;<i> have a good outline of one yet.

Good eye, John. The mention of VB.net is gone from the front page and
features list for now. I'll look into having a FAQ page set up for the
release.

I'll hold off on a roadmap until a rough project timeline is worked out.
If something like this happens at the mini-meeting in Boston, let me
know and I'll put something up. Speaking of which - I'd love to hear
what happens in Boston (particularly regarding MD). Anyone feel like
taking notes? ;)
