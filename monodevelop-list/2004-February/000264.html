Sorry about this. This is a known issue (though we're not entirely sure
where the bug is yet). For the time being, the site is only available to
gecko-based browsers.

I'm actually surprised you found the site, since it hasn't officially
been published yet. ;) I was just cleaning up dead links as I got your
email.

The site should be complete now. Please feel free to explore it and let
me know if there are any (content-based) problems. Kevin Breit wrote the
ASP.net control used in the sidebar - I will try to resolve the IE/Opera
problems with him before MonoDevelop's 0.1 release on Friday.

Thanks!

.steve
