</I>&gt;<i> Hey! Have you seen MonoDevelop? It's really cool!!! You are making a

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Time to talk about serious things. I send you 2 patches which are for:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1º WordCountDialog.patch - Adds a scrollbar to the word count dialog. I
</I>&gt;<i> was trying to view the number of words of the MonoDevelop source code
</I>&gt;<i> and I get a RRBW (really really biiiiig window), so I decided to fix it.
</I>
Committed to svn

&gt;<i> 2º PrimitiveExpression.patch - I have a laptop running Debian Sid which
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't have icu support yet, so I have been unable to run MonoDevelop
</I>&gt;<i> decently since now. It seems commenting one line MonoDevelop looks
</I>&gt;<i> stable and it doesn't seem to broke anything. I send you the patch if
</I>&gt;<i> you like to include it. I also think many people out there are going to
</I>&gt;<i> have mono running without icu support and because of that, when 0.1 is
</I>&gt;<i> released maybe this people are going to get a little dissapointed
</I>&gt;<i> because they are going to see MonoDevelop crashing a lot. Anyway here is
</I>&gt;<i> the patch.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Committed a modified patch to svn, using the InvariantCulture, which
should be working with or without ICU.

please note that this might just be a stopgap measure, ICU is required
for MD, the use you might be able to get out of MD without ICU could be
spotty at best.

&gt;<i> Note: I have to recognize this is my first patch and that I have been
</I>&gt;<i> trying to use the subversion diff command, but I have been unable to use
</I>&gt;<i> it. So I send you the patches against my local copy (rev 985). I don't
</I>&gt;<i> think you are going to have any problem, but if so, please let me know.
</I>
Thanks again for the patches, and your interest.
