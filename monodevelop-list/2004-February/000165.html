<PRE>Hey,

&gt;<i>       * Icons designed. Doing a release with our current stock/windows
</I>&gt;<i>         mix would be sortta lame.
</I>
Where are those stored?

&gt;<i>       * Also, I would like to see if we can get a few packages on Red
</I>&gt;<i>         Carpet. We should have a gtksourceview package that is in a
</I>&gt;<i>         non-unstable Ximian channel. Also, there should be a package for
</I>&gt;<i>         gtk-sourceview-sharp. As well, I would like to see a package
</I>&gt;<i>         that will register the mimetypes for C# and add icons etc.
</I>&gt;<i>         Miguel, any comments on this?
</I>
We could cross-link the package, so its not an issue.

&gt;<i>       * We need to get the CodeComplete/InsightWindow cleaned up. A few
</I>&gt;<i>         things there: 1) see if we can get the ctrl+space bindings 2)
</I>&gt;<i>         try to get the insight window either working nicely (eg, having
</I>&gt;<i>         it not stick around, etc).
</I>
I can help here;  What do you guys need?

Describe.  And I'll assist.


&gt;<i> I am a little worried about the date. It would be best to sync with a
</I>&gt;<i> Mono release so that we can take advantage of bugs that are fixed, etc.
</I>
Assume that it will be 0.30, I dont think we are doing a new release in
such a short period.

&gt;<i> We need to come up with a list of `known issues' so that we do not get
</I>&gt;<i> tons of duplicate bug reports.
</I>
Well, I would personally like to see a list of things that must be
tested visually.  

Something like:

	1. Create a Gtk# project.
	2. Build it.
	3. Run it.

		Observe: if the dialog XXX.

	2. Create a console project....

Etc.

</PRE>
