<PRE>Hey guys,
	For the past three weeks, I have been working on the MonoDevelop
website in my free time.  The site has been shown to a few people who
have given feedback (thank you!).  With the 0.1 being planned for the
end of the month, I wanted to give a quick little introduction (for
those who haven't seen the site) and a progress update.

Introduction

The MonoDevelop web site is coded using XHTML 1.1 and CSS.  This has
provided us with having really clean and easy to maintain code.  The
headers and footers are dealt with using simple ASP.NET controls.  I am
trying to use as little ASP.NET as I can, because this site doesn't need
anything more than the header/footer setup.  The number of graphics on
the front page are moderate and most other pages are relatively small. 
This is going to mean the site should be accessible to people on the
slower 28.8k modems.

There are a few reasons why the site isn't visible to all.  First, it's
very much a work in progress.  Second, I am hosting it on my personal
laptop and I'd rather not throw the IP out to the entire world.  Third,
there is a server being setup to host this on (at least temporarily) and
ASP.NET isn't being terribly cooperative to install.

Progress Update

I have made some really great progress over the past week.  There are
only 4 more bullet points on my basic TODO list.  I also have a
rendering bug which needs to be fixed before we go live.  In general,
the site is coming together very well.

I am looking for a little bit of help.  If someone could provide me with
screenshots of the program in action, I'd love that.  At this time, I
have one screenshot with some source code showing.  More eye-candy would
be good.

Thanks guys

Kevin Breit
