</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hey! Have you seen MonoDevelop? It's really cool!!! You are making a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; really great job :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Time to talk about serious things. I send you 2 patches which are for:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1º WordCountDialog.patch - Adds a scrollbar to the word count dialog. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was trying to view the number of words of the MonoDevelop source code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and I get a RRBW (really really biiiiig window), so I decided to fix it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Committed to svn
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2º PrimitiveExpression.patch - I have a laptop running Debian Sid which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't have icu support yet, so I have been unable to run MonoDevelop
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decently since now. It seems commenting one line MonoDevelop looks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stable and it doesn't seem to broke anything. I send you the patch if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you like to include it. I also think many people out there are going to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have mono running without icu support and because of that, when 0.1 is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; released maybe this people are going to get a little dissapointed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because they are going to see MonoDevelop crashing a lot. Anyway here is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the patch.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Committed a modified patch to svn, using the InvariantCulture, which
</I>&gt;<i> should be working with or without ICU.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> please note that this might just be a stopgap measure, ICU is required
</I>&gt;<i> for MD, the use you might be able to get out of MD without ICU could be
</I>&gt;<i> spotty at best.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>
Just wanted to note that I believe mono is going to not depend on ICU in
the future for I18N, so once that dependency is removed MonoDevelop
won't depend on it.
