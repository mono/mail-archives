<PRE>Hey,

	I have been doing some thinking and checking stuff out, and I want to
do a MonoDevelop release at the end of February, February 27th in
specific.

	To any contributor, if you have something that you want to see in the
0.1 release, please please make sure its near complete and ready to be
integrated on the 23rd so we can get some time making sure the
integration is bug free (relatively ;)). Please keep in mind for
inclusion in the 0.1 release there are a couple things that have to be
met.

	1) It needs to be a good citizen of the MonoDevelop framework, meeting
every API requirement.
	2) No known blocking bugs. (Particularly ones without workarounds).

	I hope to have the new editor, and the docker in for sure, as well as
hopefully other smaller features.

	Anyway if you have any issues find me on irc or on reply here.

--Todd
