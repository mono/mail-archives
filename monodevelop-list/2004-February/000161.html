<PRE>I think we should make sure to get:

      * Branding done. This means getting a MD icon and using it in the
        icon bar, etc.
      * Scripts to do any setup needed (eg, mime type registration,
        installing the csharp.lang file)
      * Icons designed. Doing a release with our current stock/windows
        mix would be sortta lame.
      * The new editor, as you said.
      * Something like bug-buddy set up. So, if a stacktrace is
        generated from MD, it should send a email to that bugzilla
        daemon, so we get it on bugzilla. It should send a stack trace
        and allow the user to enter extra information
      * Also, I would like to see if we can get a few packages on Red
        Carpet. We should have a gtksourceview package that is in a
        non-unstable Ximian channel. Also, there should be a package for
        gtk-sourceview-sharp. As well, I would like to see a package
        that will register the mimetypes for C# and add icons etc.
        Miguel, any comments on this?
      * We need to get the CodeComplete/InsightWindow cleaned up. A few
        things there: 1) see if we can get the ctrl+space bindings 2)
        try to get the insight window either working nicely (eg, having
        it not stick around, etc).

Some of these items are not critical for this release (like packages on
RC), but most I really dont think we should release without.

I am a little worried about the date. It would be best to sync with a
Mono release so that we can take advantage of bugs that are fixed, etc.

We need to come up with a list of `known issues' so that we do not get
tons of duplicate bug reports.
