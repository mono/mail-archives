<PRE>Hi folks,

I've made substantial advancements with my ERP project developed with MD, but 
for future versions, may I make you some suggestions:

* Create and integrate some more &quot;high-level&quot; widgets like a spreadsheet 
widget (I'm currently developing one, but it looks rather primitive) or a 
bar-graph widget.

* Add support for database-bound fields, which are common in RAD environments 
like MS Visual FoxPro (which is tied to the MS SQL Server and to WinXP / 
WinVista). This would greatly decrease the coding burden for all those who 
are developing database-driving apps. As most OSS developers use MySQL or 
PostgreSQL, I think it's enough in the first pace to add support for these 
two DBMSes.

These improvements would be a big leap towards a development tool, which can 
compete with the commercially available state-of.the-art IDEs and would also 
act as a booster for the develpoment of platform-neutral (!!!) ERP, CRM, and 
other business solutions.

Please tell me your opinion. Thank you.

Regards
Jacek Ru&#380;yczka
