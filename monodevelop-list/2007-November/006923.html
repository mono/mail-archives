<PRE>Hey folks,

    Am working to port some code in my abundant spare time, this is not
really a project I spend a lot of time on, and code is scattered across
multiple libraries and projects inside the Solution.

    When I get a stack trace, I would like to quickly find a file (I can
infer the file from the stack trace) but doing this with MD is too
difficult, I have to go clicking and opening all the tree items to find
it.   This is why I had suggested in the past a search feature in the
solution pad.

    Having a hot key, say C-o (for open) switch to the solution pad and
activate &quot;search for filenames&quot; would be the best possible thing for me.
This is similar to what Jujitsu does, or what TextMate does, let you
pick a file from your project, which chances are, is what you are really
looking for.

    To be honest, I do not see the point in the current &quot;Open File&quot; in
the File dialog.  The reality is that most of the time, I would need to
add the file to a project for it to be useful, so it is kind of useless
as it is today.   Maybe we could keep that behavior as Control-Alt-o or
something like that.

Miguel.
