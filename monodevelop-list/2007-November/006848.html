<PRE>Here is my way of determining &quot;who to hit&quot; when there is an issue
on browsing a website: try some other browser engine (gecko,
opera, IE, safari etc.) and if other browsers work fine, then
it is the browser or its environment which is bad. For firefox
--profile option would also give different environment for add-ins.
If other browsers do not work fine too, then it is very likely the
issue at the website, not the browser.

So you are saying you couldn't browse Novell web site. Is it
correct approach to complain against Novell without trying other
browsers? You sort of know that your firefox had some bugs and
still try to complain against the web site, which sounds weird to me.
