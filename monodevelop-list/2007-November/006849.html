</I>Yes, unfortunately this is a problem. I've complained about it and they
fixed some things, but they're refusing to fix the overall problem.

The problem is this. Not all novell.com accounts need to be confirmed,
as not all areas of novell.com requires confirmation to enter.
Therefore, they decided to not send out confirmation e-mails
automatically anymore.

Unfortunately, since Bugzilla requires confirmation, to get the
confirmation e-mail you have to login to Bugzilla. When you do so, it
will error saying you haven't confirmed, and give you a link to request
a confirmation e-mail. Once you click the link, it will send you the
e-mail and you can confirm your account.

Trust me, I understand the absurdity of this, but they refuse to change
it. What they did fix was the Bugzilla error presented to the user (it
used to be unintelligible).

I know this doesn't help much, but the openSUSE project is in the same
boat. Hopefully we can eventually get through to these people.
