<PRE>&gt;<i> This is probably more of a job for a 3rd Party Component Vendor or
</I>&gt;<i> something, may I suggest you take your spreadsheet widget and release out
</I>&gt;<i> at e.g. SourceForge under e.g. LGPL or something...?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I'll do that once it runs stably. Some time in the future it should look like 
the javax.swing.JTable counterpart in Java / Swing: 
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/components/table.html">http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/components/table.html</A>

&gt;<i> Have you searched for existing 3rd Party Libraries solving those issues...?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I've already done that, found several solutions for Ajax, but not for Gtk# 
desktop apps.

&gt;<i> I assume you've developed for Desktop systems, but I'l say this anyway. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> one of the core developers behind Gaia Ajax Widgets
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://ajaxwidgets.com">http://ajaxwidgets.com</A>) which is a (commercially backed) Open Source Ajax
</I>&gt;<i> library for ASP.NET and all though we don't have a SpreadSheet Widgets it's
</I>&gt;<i> very easy to create one yourself since you can just wrap the existing Mono
</I>&gt;<i> ones like Repeater or GridView etc and make them &quot;ajaxified&quot;...?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It's gonna be a Gtk# desktop app.

&gt;<i> However this question is probably more likely to get intelligent answer on
</I>&gt;<i> any of the &quot;Mono&quot; lists and not on the IDE list. ;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Well, theoretically the guys &amp; girls developing Gtk# could help me...

&gt;<i> Still it's probably more of a job for a 3rd Party SW Vendor than of the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;core Mono&quot; development team...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&quot;3rd party SW vendor&quot; would mean some OSS developer in this context. 
Generally, the Mono / MD community is still quite small, but I hope that this 
will change in the near future, so that somebody will concentrate on these 
fancy high-level widgets and then integrate them into MD.

Regards
Jacek
