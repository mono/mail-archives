<PRE>Yes I did add the file to the project, I even copied the contents of the
file into a temporary text file and deleted the origanal from the project
and added a new class it does not seem to have worked, both classes are both
in the same namespace. So if that's what to look for I am somewhat relieved
it's not anything I have done.

However upon trying this a second time, just to make sure, the class was
detected, this was somewhat strange it not working once then working a
second time.

If anyone thinks it's worth reporting as a bug I shall, if someone tells me
where to go/what to do.
