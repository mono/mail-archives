</I>&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;<i> However this question is probably more likely to get intelligent answer on

</I>&gt;<i> Still it's probably more of a job for a 3rd Party SW Vendor than of the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;core Mono&quot; development team...
</I>
The Mono Project website lists many libraries
(<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Libraries">http://www.mono-project.com/Libraries</A>) that work with Mono. However,
reusable widgets are difficult to design without strong use cases and
known consumers, so I agree with Thomas that they are best &quot;spun out&quot;
of existing projects (MonoDevelop and Banshee contain a few) or
developed by a third party with a specific plan to drive adoption.

Databinding's different, as it's usually quite core to a GUI
framework. However, though many ideas for GTK# databinding have been
thrown around, there are many known &quot;models&quot; of databinding and it's
unclear which would be most useful. We also don't have any strong use
cases from interested developers.
