<PRE>Hello Zach,

&gt;<i> I think the &quot;Open File In Solution&quot; dialog I added last March (wow,
</I>&gt;<i> time sure does fly as that was my first real MD contribution!) may
</I>&gt;<i> solve this problem for you.  By hitting Shift-Alt-O or choosing
</I>&gt;<i> File-&gt;Open File In Solution, you will bring up a dialog that lets you
</I>&gt;<i> quickly type in a search string and will dynamically update the list
</I>&gt;<i> of matching files.  You can then use Up/Down and Enter to select the
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate file.  I really can't live without this feature anymore,
</I>&gt;<i> which is why I added it. :)  It also works for types in the solution
</I>&gt;<i> with Ctrl-Shift-T or View-&gt;Go To Type.  I pretty much never use the
</I>&gt;<i> actual solution pad for opening files anymore.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or perhaps that's not at all what you're looking for?
</I>
This is exactly what am looking for, I can use this, and it seems
incredibly useful;   It has a few glitches, like it seems to add stuff
as it loads, and that means that contents shift positions as the loading
happens. 

Some feedback on how I think this could be improved:

	* Alt-Shift-O and Control-Shift-T, seems odd that they would
	  use different prefixes for a common operation.

	* The window would be nicer if it was a little bit larger.  On
	  my machine, I can only see 5 rows of matches, 

	* When doing a type search it would be useful if the type
	  search happens not only on the class name, but if it
	  was able to match also on the full name.

	  Currently I type FileInfo, but it would be nice if I could
	  type System.IO.File as I go, because I might not remember 
	  the name of the type, a little bit like the monodoc 
	  type search functionality: it offers more than one slot
	  for the same name.

Miguel.
