&gt;<i> Hi folks,

This is probably more of a job for a 3rd Party Component Vendor or
something, may I suggest you take your spreadsheet widget and release out at
e.g. SourceForge under e.g. LGPL or something...?
Have you searched for existing 3rd Party Libraries solving those issues...?

I assume you've developed for Desktop systems, but I'l say this anyway. I'm
one of the core developers behind Gaia Ajax Widgets (<A HREF="http://ajaxwidgets.com">http://ajaxwidgets.com</A>)
which is a (commercially backed) Open Source Ajax library for ASP.NET and
all though we don't have a SpreadSheet Widgets it's very easy to create one
yourself since you can just wrap the existing Mono ones like Repeater or
GridView etc and make them &quot;ajaxified&quot;...?

I assume there are other companies delivering widgets that should (at least
with some sort of porting) work or something work with Mono, both on Desktop
and on the Web(2.0 - Ajax)

However this question is probably more likely to get intelligent answer on
any of the &quot;Mono&quot; lists and not on the IDE list. ;)
Still it's probably more of a job for a 3rd Party SW Vendor than of the
&quot;core Mono&quot; development team...


Have a nice day :)
