Can you show what your addin.xml file looks like? And you do realize
that you have to put that file in build/AddIns/ for make run, and get it
installed into $prefix/lib/monodevelop/AddIns/ for the installed version
to pick it up.

Basically. First make sure your addin.xml file is being picked up by MD
(if it is a new file) and then second, make sure your pad extension is
&quot;/SharpDevelop/Workbench/Views&quot;
