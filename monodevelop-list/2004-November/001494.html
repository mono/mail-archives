<PRE>Hi guys, I've been having this distinctly repeatable problem with
Monodevelop which I built from svn a week ago against mono/mcs svn at
that time.

Basically i was trying to convert the SWF.sln project to monodevelop
located at:

mcs/class/Managed.Windows.Forms/SWF.sln

It would convert it successfully, but then when the time  came to load
the combine the call to Combine.backgroundLoadCombine (string) would
never return, meaning I could never load the combine.

The only way I was able to get around this was to start two instances of
Monodevelop at the same time, and then try and open the combine from one
of the instances. Whenever I do this I can load the combine fine. Once
this is done I no-longer need to have two instances open to load the
combine any more.

Not sure why this is happening, any suggestions ?

JBA

P.S. I can't build md from svn cause someone added Syscall.chmod to
Combine.cs and I have no idea wtf to get that file from.
