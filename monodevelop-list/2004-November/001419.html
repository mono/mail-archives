<PRE>Are you using monodevelop from subversion? If so you shouldn't symlink 
the gtk-sharp files. Simply uninstall gtk-sharp2 from cvs, and install 
it again with ./autogen.sh -prefix=/usr
This is due to mono default installation beeing in /usr but gtk-sharp2 
from cvs default is /usr/local
Again, only do that if you are using monodevelop from subversion.

Now, your real question. The message you getting is normal. After you 
load a project in MonoDevelop it read that pidb that I don't really know 
what they are, but I think it is the database files for autocompletation 
(can anyone confirm this to me?), anyway it's normal.

Now, the references. I don't think you really want this files next to 
the solution files. When you compile either in VS.NET or 
MonoDevelop/SharpDevelop the assemblies will be in 
preoject_path/bin/debug (or release) you can check this behaviour (sorry 
my english, I think I don't know how to write this word, lol) in project 
properties. You can try to move this file into bin/debug folder or you 
can delete the reference from the project and add it again 
right-clicking references and choosing &quot;.net assembly&quot; and then browse 
it. My first solution is advisable even if you need to re-add the reference.

Now, the *BAD* news.

*Could not find: Interop.WIALib.dll
*Could not find: ByteFX.MySqlClient.dll'

The not so bad: You should use the MySqlClient delivered with mono. I 
think it is from ByteFX too. So it will be easy.
The *really* bad. This will not work in Linux. (dot) You are using a 
windows COM and you created a Interop Assembly. Linux doesn't support 
COM. Your first work arround is to find an library similar to that in 
windows and build a Wrapper (Interop) assembly. Just like we do for 
gtk-sharp that's a wrapper for a linux library called GTK and its coded 
in native code. The second way is too reimplet that WIALib in 100% 
Managed Code (C#). And the last option is to see if wine can handle that 
COM .dll you are trying to use, that maybe really easy like &quot;plug&amp;play&quot; 
or can take a long way to do nothing... your shoot now!

Hope it helps,
