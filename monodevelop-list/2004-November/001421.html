<PRE>I'm building some extra features to monodevelop in order to get to know

GTK-Sharp and of course to help MonoDevelop get better.
I've an other project that I wish to port an make it builded-in 
MonoDevelop, and for that I need a SourceEditor, really similiar to the 
existing one. The things I'll need the most are some icons in left-side 
of sourceeditor, just like the line numbers and bookmarks in MD. Also I 
may need a simililar &quot;frame&quot; but horizontal and between lines, and 
functions like to hide/show some code (I think the name is &quot;folder code&quot;).

So I whish to know if this is possible with the existing sourceeditor, 
the horizontal &quot;frame&quot; and to show icons...

If not, but is always a possible option to me, I wish to build a 
sourceeditor to me. I wish to know what is the best way... your opinion.
I was thinking of to build a TextBox array (without borders, etc...) and 
code the keypress to change lines. This seems to me fairly easy but I 
think the memory and  performance could be hard issues. Also, I don't 
know if I can get colors with a simple textbox?

Please give me your opinions, and sorry my bad english!
Thanks,
Alexandre Gomes, Portugal
