<PRE>I spoke too soon. &#160;I'm having fewer problems but 2.6 is not working as well as before a try of 2.8.

Go to Declaration rarely works or is available as an option
Code Completion will work okay for a while and then begins taking longer and longer to return, then comes good again.

This is making it very hard to work. &#160;I've tried deleting obj files, clean rebuilds, deleting code completion cache, reinstalls, and nothing is helping.

Any suggestions? &#160;Could different policy settings impact code completion? &#160;I remember policy convert messages popping up while I was playing with 2.8.

Cheers

Subject: Re: [MonoDevelop] Code completion problems with 2.8b2 and backed up project files


Code completion did not work for me either with 2.8 on Mac. I recovered my projects by editing the csproj files and adjusting  ProjectTypeGuids. I can't recall if I still had problems after this. I did do a clean all, however. I also had removed all obj folders, can't recall if that was before or after the downgrade (I was trying many things to get code completion to work under 2.8).

Hello All,&#160;
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I updated from 2.6 to 2.8b2 (mac) to try out the MonoTouch xcode 4 stuff. &#160;The code completion was so slow - literally 15 seconds for a single key stroke - that I rolled back to the previous version. &#160;I used the auto backed up versions of my project files that 2.8b2 created but now found the code completion problem had followed me to 2.6 and indeed every previous version of MonoDevelop I tried.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>After a few hours of &quot;arrrgh!!&quot; I thought to nuke the auto backed up projects and rebuild them from scratch in 2.6 (and grab some from source control)- all returned to normal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So, its appears the backed up project files might have a problem. &#160;I'm not seeing complaints about the code completion from others using 2.8b2 is this a problem for anyone else?
