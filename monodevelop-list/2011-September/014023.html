<PRE>I agree that code completion became fragile after a 2.6 upgrade. I
came across this a few minutes ago and thought there was an outside
change it may help isolate the problem. In a file I am editing, code
completion works within the method I am editing prior to, but not
after this line:

while (values[i] &gt;= ans.GroupLimits[gat][1]) {gat++;}

If I comment that line out, code completion works in the whole method,
with that line present, code completion simply does nothing anywhere
in the method after that line. It apparently is due to the braces,
since with a little experimentation, the following line, replacing the
previous at the same point in the code also breaks completion:

{double x = 1;}

For what it is worth this line is nested within two if's and a foreach:

if (...) {
   if (...) {
     foreach (...) {
          ...
          {double x = 1;}

If I catch a few minutes later today I'll try to construct a small
example and will post a bug if I can.

Matt

</I>&gt;<i> Hello All,
</I>&gt;<i> I updated from 2.6 to 2.8b2 (mac) to try out the MonoTouch xcode 4 stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;The code completion was so slow - literally 15 seconds for a single key
</I>&gt;<i> stroke - that I rolled back to the previous version. &#160;I used the auto backed
</I>&gt;<i> up versions of my project files that 2.8b2 created but now found the code
</I>&gt;<i> completion problem had followed me to 2.6 and indeed every previous version
</I>&gt;<i> of MonoDevelop I tried.
</I>&gt;<i> After a few hours of &quot;arrrgh!!&quot; I thought to nuke the auto backed up
</I>&gt;<i> projects and rebuild them from scratch in 2.6 (and grab some from source
</I>&gt;<i> control)- all returned to normal.
</I>&gt;<i> So, its appears the backed up project files might have a problem. &#160;I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> seeing complaints about the code completion from others using 2.8b2 is this
</I>&gt;<i> a problem for anyone else?
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers
