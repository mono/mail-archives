<PRE>Is there someone responsible for maintaining the Mono / Monodevelop web
sites? I did a search to get a development roadmap, but there are
multiple
sites giving roadmaps, some of which are totally outdated. I would be
great if someone can close down web sites or Wiki pages that are not
used any more.

Here are some MonoDevelop roadmaps:
<A HREF="http://monodevelop.com/Developers/Roadmap">http://monodevelop.com/Developers/Roadmap</A>  (from the URL is seems like
the page to be, but is it the latest release info?)
<A HREF="http://mono.wikia.com/wiki/MonoDevelop">http://mono.wikia.com/wiki/MonoDevelop</A> (also looks like an official URL,
but look at the text in the Roadmap section - it reads 
&quot;The next release (1.1) will arrive in Fall 2008, roughly 6 months after
MD 1.0.&quot;)
So, if there are 2 MonoDevelop roadmaps and the best of the two has data
more than a year old, then can you really call it 
a roadmap? Is the point of a roadmap not to indicate plans for future
development? And if so, is there yet another roadmap
somewhere that I just have not found yet?

And then there are the Mono project roadmaps:
<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/road-to-1.0.html">http://www.go-mono.com/road-to-1.0.html</A> 
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Mono_Project_Roadmap">http://www.mono-project.com/Mono_Project_Roadmap</A> (this looks like the
real thing, but look at the heading: &quot;Last update: June 2010&quot; and yet it
contains
the Mono 2.10 release date: &quot;Released: February 15th, 2011&quot;).

As I mentioned earlier, it would be great if someone can dispose of web
sites and wiki pages that are not in use any more.

Kind regards
John Bester
