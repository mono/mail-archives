<PRE>Hello --

I have been using MonoDevelop for a little while, and in multiple versions from before 2.4 until 2.6 on both Ubuntu as well as 3 different versions of MS Windows. 

I have a project with a window that was made in the Designer (stetic?) It is not too complex but contains a few containers and some items. In addition to that, the project now has 2 more windows in it. 

What I have found, and I will happily accept blame for it if necessary, is that at some point, though it appears to work, the designer no longer effects changes. It will happily go through the motions of letting me modify or add widgets but, the code it no longer generates any more code in the hidden .cs file with the same name as the window. 

I have found that if I care to, I can hand modify the hidden file with the changes and they will take when I recompile. So in addition to not putting anything new or changing anything existing in the file, it does not overwrite changes I have manually added. 

Questions:
1. Is there a way to regenerate the stetic.gui from a working .cs file?
2. Is there a way to regenerate the hidden .cs file from the gui.stetic file?
    a. I tried removing the files from that directory (except the gui.stetic) and recompiling. All it did was regenerate the very basics of the file, without even the Build() method included.
3. Is there an easy to get these things back into alignment using both files?
4. What can I do to avoid this going forward?
    a. I only tried to hand modify, or delete files after there was a problem. The only naughty things I did prior was to move the files from one machine to another recompiling in MonoDevelop or SharpDevelop in either Ubuntu or Window XP, Vista and/or 7.

Thanks for all the work on such a great tool
