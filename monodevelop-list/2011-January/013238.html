Some comments/pointers on this issue, now that I've got it working:

1) Stack traces don't have to come from exceptions. If you scroll to the 
right far enough in the Call Stack window then the path is there as well :)

2) It seems that the Mono repo in the OBS bundles the .cs files in the 
-debugsource build in /usr/src/debug/mono-2.8.2, which needs sym-linking 
under /usr/src/packages/BUILD/ for step-in to work on openSUSE 11.3, but 
the standard openSUSE packages don't include it and I had to get the 
.src.rpm myself [1]

2a) Installing the .src.rpm doesn't quite get you what you need. Open it 
with file-roller, open the .tar.bz2 from inside it, and extract the 
contents of *that* into the correct location

Oh, and a final semi-obvious one:

2b) Trying to make do with the 2.8.2 debugsource and symlinking it as 
2.6.4 kinda works in that it shows code, but too many changes have 
occurred so nothing matches up - obvious, but watch out for it before 
trying to take a shortcut!

It could have been easier, but other than defaulting to not stepping 
into non-project code then I think most of the simplicity issues are 
openSUSE packaging issues rather than MonoDevelop. Now to see which 
other SRPMs I need...
