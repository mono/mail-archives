<PRE>Hiya,

I'm wondering if there is a way to directly invoke the assembly browser.
Currently I have to include the assembly as a reference and then open
that to launch it. 

Ideally I'd like to just be able to feed monodevelop the dll on the
command line somehow to just start MD with the assembly browser on that
file.

Regards

Ian
