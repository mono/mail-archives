Michael,

That all sounds like a good idea and would suit my way of working as 
well. I'm in a similar situation that I don't use it but keep 
accidentally activating the grouping. Shift+Space seems close enough to 
not involve too much moving and similar enough to be memorable while not 
being too easy to accidentally do if you don't want it.

I think the &quot;always group by something when we have grouping mode&quot; is a 
good idea, as it would make it explicit what the current behaviour is. 
You mentioned alternatives of different types - have you looked at the 
Eclipse &quot;content assist&quot;? They have what they call &quot;proposal kinds&quot; for 
their auto-complete functionality. The default is to show everything, 
but you can also have filtered sub-sets (e.g. Java Type Proposals, Java 
Non-Type Proposals, Java Proposals, Template Proposals, etc). The 
proposals are filtering rather than grouping, but they are quite useful 
for similar reasons to what you're suggesting. For example, if I want to 
create a JUnit test then I type &quot;Te&quot;, hit Ctrl+Space twice (brings up 
content assist then moves to Template Proposals) and the &quot;Test&quot; template 
is now top of the list, where as it would have been about a dozen items 
down in the first list it showed. If you want to check it out yourself 
then it is in Window &gt; Preferences then Java &gt; Editor &gt; Content Assist &gt; 
Advanced.

On the off-chance that I did ever want grouping (or if it became more 
like the Eclipse filtering and cycled options rather than just toggling 
grouping) then making it fall back to your default behaviour each time 
sounds like a sensible approach.

As with everything, once it gets implemented then I'll happily keep up 
with the Git head and test it :) I've already learnt that Shift+Up/Down 
exists just from this email.

My only thought with it not being key-bindable is whether something else 
somewhere will clash with it outside MD. From a quick search then 
OpenOffice.org seems to have had complaints about accidentally 
triggering it [1], and apparently some Mac apps use it for scrolling 
back up [2]. The main results appear to be app-specific, so it'd just be 
a change of convention rather than a collision, but there might be 
something.

Regards,

IBBoard
