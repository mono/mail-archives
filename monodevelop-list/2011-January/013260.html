Hello everyone. I recently found MonoDevelop through it's relationship to
Unity3D and I thought &quot;This is great, far better than the implemented
Scite!&quot; so I wanted to start coding and .... after 2 lines I already could
not proceed:

MonoDevelop apparently hates you for using brackets [] and curly brackets {
} and does not let me do them. It feels a little silly if you think that you
need those symbols frequently if you want to do programming/scripting.

I think it might have something to do with my German Keyboard Layout. In
order to achieve the symbols, you need to press:
CTRL + ALT + 7 = {
CTRL + ALT + 8 = [
CTRL + ALT + 9 = ]
CTRL + ALT + 0 = }

I found out the common issue is with CTRL + ALT. For example if I press CTRL
+ ALT + Q for &quot;@&quot;, it doesn't work either.

So, obviouly this is a serious issue since those are not insignificant key
combinations.

I'd appreciate help to fix this issue, otherwise I guess I'll have to keep
using SciTe. I just really wanted to give MonoDevelop a fair shot too since
it seemed kinda nice :(

Thanks.
