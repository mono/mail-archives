<PRE>Is there a roadmap for MD 2.6? So far I've noticed that the splash has 
changed, that it is now tagged &quot;beta 1&quot; and that a few version numbers 
have been upped. I've also seen Lluis tag one of my tickets as being for 
milestone 2.6, but the main MD website is a bit outdated in places.

The Roadmap [1] from the Dev page [2] is still for v2.4. &quot;Features by 
release&quot; [3] has 2.6 on it, but progress doesn't look good and 2.4 is 
still top of the list.

I don't mind when 2.6 actually comes out, since I'm using the Git builds 
anyway, but I just thought that a bit of obvious pointing to what was 
coming might encourage a bit of interest :)
