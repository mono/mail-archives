<PRE>Has anyone else been using the more recent git builds (since about the 
18th Jan) and been getting complete freezes and unresponsiveness? I 
don't want to report it as a bug yet as it isn't reproducable - it is 
recurring, but not with a definite set of steps yet.

At first I'd thought it was a lag when I switched to larger files as it 
processed them for colouring, but recently it seems to have been 
happening after reverting files (but not always). There's no obviously 
high processor usage by MonoDevelop, although memory usage is up at 22% 
(nearly 1GB), but Compiz has greyed it out and the UI is completely 
unresponsive. Closing the window instantly gives me the &quot;Force quit?&quot; 
dialog.

So, is it just me or is it something other people are experiencing that 
we need a scenario for that reliably recreates it?

Thanks.
</PRE>
