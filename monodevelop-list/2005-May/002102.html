<PRE>I have been investigating the offerings of IDEs for both Sharpdevelop
[SD] and Monodevelop [MD] but I really cant understand some things, so I
will summarize and let you fill the gaps:
MD is a gtk fork of SD, does that mean that when Corsavy (SD2) is
shipped MD will offer the same functionality [in that near future] ?
MD is tuned to run for mono or ms implementation of cli ? Can this be
changed ? Its important because my UIs are in Windows.Forms
SD is currently v1.1, MD is v0.X . Does that mean than the forking is
not complete ?
Is MD stuffed with the integrated nant [build tool] and code completion
plugins SD has ?
Is there code exchange between the two projects ? I have been studying
SD's architecture. Can I expect to find MD identical [or greatly simmilar] ?

Thanks in advance
