<PRE>Hi.

I have been looking at extending the ReturnType class. This will lead
to massive code updated in the code completion persistance parts as
well as a lot of other places. Since we have no unit tests to rely
upon I am very reluctant to do this.

So I have decided to create an interface named ISourceCodeElement
instead and follow the following list of steps:

1. Create an empty interface named ISourceCodeElement and have
IProperty, IMethod etc. implement it.
2. Add a IReturnType property to ISourceCodeElement 
3. Use ISourceCodeElements instead of IReturnType in the Resolve and
TypeVisitor classes.
4. Add a MonoDocReference string property to ISourceCodeElement. So an
object implementing the IProperty for a property Prop in a namespace
NS would return the string &quot;P:NS.Prop&quot;.
5. Add an IRegion property to ISourceCodeElement. This would help
implement the goto declaration functionality.
6. Add a ToolTip string property to ISourceCodeElement. This will
implement the tool tip functionality.

Does this sound like the way to go?
