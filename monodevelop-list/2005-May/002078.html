</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Hrm I was certain a 1.0x release included monodevelop. It must have
</I>&gt;<i>    been an RPM build on my linux box - you would know.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      We have that, .mdp and .mds
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    These are standard formats? Why reinvent the wheel?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; -Access to a ton of tasks that will exercise everything in the
</I>&gt;<i>      .NET
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; framework plus many open source tools that when used by
</I>&gt;<i>      monodevelop
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; can make the IDE even more attractive
</I>&gt;<i>      Um, distill that into english, not marketing blah. That means
</I>&gt;<i>      nothing to
</I>&gt;<i>      me as a developer. and I doubt nant gets us that too easily.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    It may mean nothing to you as a developer - but people want to use
</I>&gt;<i>    mono (and your IDE) to write software applications. Some of these
</I>&gt;<i>    software applications might, god forbid, want to use the other tools
</I>&gt;<i>    included with mono that are not visual (read - command line) and not
</I>&gt;<i>    exposed through monodevelop. If you dont care, then you obviously care
</I>&gt;<i>    only about your own productivity and not the other developers who
</I>&gt;<i>    SHOULD be wanting to use your IDE. With this attitude I understand why
</I>&gt;<i>    you look at monodevelop as a &quot;for fun&quot; product. Why not just shut the
</I>&gt;<i>    thing down now and create a real project that bears the moniker &quot;mono&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>    in the name for those of us who would like to create software that
</I>&gt;<i>    makes money on mono instead of playing tinker toys with your side job
</I>&gt;<i>    priorities. I don't think Novell created mono &quot;for fun&quot;.
</I>
Troll.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      That has never been our intent, we want to provide linux users with
</I>&gt;<i>      a
</I>&gt;<i>      good IDE to do C# work in, not convert #D users to use an IDE that
</I>&gt;<i>      doesn't even run on their host platform.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Well my bad that it's beyond your technical abilities to recognize
</I>&gt;<i>    that using strictly Gtk# could make your IDE run on all platforms that
</I>&gt;<i>    support mono. Your being as ignorant as Microsoft to tie it to linux.
</I>
Troll.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; -A reason for the NAnt team to create turn-key distros for linux
</I>&gt;<i>      Uh. I guess... not really a win for anyone involved in MonoDevelop.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Again you only care about the monodevelop team. I can see you've never
</I>&gt;<i>    written software for a customer, or if you have, there's a reason why
</I>&gt;<i>    your not anymore.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; -Less lines of code in the build environment
</I>&gt;<i>      *wrong*
</I>&gt;<i>      You have no idea how much logic it would take to replicate make
</I>&gt;<i>      install,
</I>&gt;<i>      make run, make dist, and make distcheck.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    I have a perfect idea, I just converted 4 of your build scripts dude
</I>&gt;<i>    and told you it halved the lines. Go ahead, tell me you've used Ant
</I>&gt;<i>    with Java and don't believe me again...
</I>
And do the include the features like distcheck and dist?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; -Better readability and validation of build files because they
</I>&gt;<i>      are
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt; well formed XML not just text
</I>&gt;<i>      dude.
</I>&gt;<i>      make validates our makefiles.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    So it prevents you from putting a typo in the file with your text
</I>&gt;<i>    editor? No it doesn't validate until you run. You can validate XML
</I>&gt;<i>    before you even save it - oh that's right you knew that because of
</I>&gt;<i>    your superior XML knowledge *rolls eyes*.
</I>
So it's validly formed XML. No more likely to actually *build* something
than a makefile is. Both actually need to be run to verify that, so
&quot;valid XML&quot; really doesn't gain you anything.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      And as far as a mono IDE depending on platform-specific code...
</I>&gt;<i>      well..
</I>&gt;<i>      auto* works fine on win32. look at SFW and cygwin please.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    So because you don't want to put a 5 meg installation (NAnt)
</I>&gt;<i>    dependency on your build and standardize it for all platforms that
</I>&gt;<i>    support mono, windows users should have to put the bloat that is
</I>&gt;<i>    cygwin on their box. If you had a clue you'd realize how ignorant this
</I>&gt;<i>    argument is. Obviously you don't.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      Get NAnt build files that do exactly what we do with the auto*
</I>&gt;<i>      build
</I>&gt;<i>      system, and we would happily look at switching. And because you
</I>&gt;<i>      didn't
</I>&gt;<i>      seem to see the list of things nant *doesnt* do for free, let me
</I>&gt;<i>      list it
</I>&gt;<i>      again:
</I>&gt;<i>      1) i18n integration
</I>&gt;<i>      2) make dist
</I>&gt;<i>      3) make distcheck
</I>&gt;<i>      4) make run
</I>&gt;<i>      5) make install
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    What a sad day. Someone please tell me when a customer focused IDE
</I>&gt;<i>    project for mono is going to begin. This one's a waste of time...
</I>
Ok, stop trolling and actually address the points he's raising. Todd has
proposed several *concrete* issues faced in moving over to nant, and
you've dismissed them because you've chosen to make wild assumptions
about Todd's character, his experience, and what he does for a living.
Stop with the BS personal attacks, and stick to the technical issues.
