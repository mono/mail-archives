<PRE>I think that from summarizing your needs the best approach would be to
have a MD builder, a console utility, detached from MD that takes
.mds/.mdp files and just compiles them,  using platform-neutral
managed code. I would refactor that part of MD into a library, called
by MD and by this console 'mdbuild' (?).

The problems I see are:

1-- .mds/.mdb files format aren't stable
2-- MD plugins may interfere (They need to follow some stricter design
rules, like having no-UI, to be usable as nice 'tasks' in this build
system).

Just some wild thoughts,

&gt;<i> Hey Todd,
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>  I was playing around with Monodevelop on Ubuntu this weekend and trying to
</I>&gt;<i> get my head around more details of its current build process and where you
</I>&gt;<i> guys are going with the product. Your comment on &quot;if you want Monodevelop to
</I>&gt;<i> run on Windows, grab an editor and get started&quot; was thought provoking. I
</I>&gt;<i> know what you are saying but it would seem like if the goal of MD is
</I>&gt;<i> currently to only run on linux, there was (as you alluded to) alot of
</I>&gt;<i> decision making that has been done in the project's architecture and
</I>&gt;<i> build/deploy process selecting tools that work well with linux and not all
</I>&gt;<i> platforms. 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>  My first assumption that older MD builds ran on Windows and that the
</I>&gt;<i> current ones just weren't ready yet for win32 was obviously wrong :). When I
</I>&gt;<i> had this mistaken impression I thought NAnt made sense because it would make
</I>&gt;<i> things (in my mind) easier to build and test under several OS's to ensure
</I>&gt;<i> consistency without having to load alot of stuff like cygwin or other *nix
</I>&gt;<i> emulation environment things. This would help me and some other windows C#
</I>&gt;<i> developers contribute code back to the project easier, but I know it's not a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;fix all&quot; for all people.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>  Knowing win32 (or mac osx for that matter?) support is not really a project
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;goal&quot;, I am not sure if it would even make sense for me to try to get it
</I>&gt;<i> building on win32 with all the tools you guys probably rely on that are
</I>&gt;<i> linux specific. Wheter it makes sense or not though, I would be curious what
</I>&gt;<i> these platform-tying issues are if it's not too much of a pain for you to
</I>&gt;<i> maybe forward me some emails or anything that other people you mentioned who
</I>&gt;<i> ran into this stuff found while trying to do the same thing. Maybe the stuff
</I>&gt;<i> that needs to be ported isn't as significant as I think it is and I still
</I>&gt;<i> can help with some of this - I just don't know yet how extensive these
</I>&gt;<i> changes are based on my current knowledge of the build process.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>  I guess from a &quot;user&quot; standpoint the problem right now is that if I want to
</I>&gt;<i> create a C# software project that is targeting mono to run on multiple
</I>&gt;<i> platforms (lets say an ASP.NET app or winforms product) and I use an IDE
</I>&gt;<i> like MD to create my &quot;solution / project&quot; file under linux, when trying to
</I>&gt;<i> compile that same code on another platform, that &quot;solution / project&quot; file I
</I>&gt;<i> created in MD now does nothing for me and I need to create a new one (for
</I>&gt;<i> instance for SharpDevelop, Visual Studio .NET, or XDevelop) when I build on
</I>&gt;<i> something other than linux. This creates a problem because if I have several
</I>&gt;<i> project team members who use different platforms we have to maintain
</I>&gt;<i> multiple project / build technology formats (e.g. I just added 3 files, can
</I>&gt;<i> you please add these to the other 2 IDE's project files and check them back
</I>&gt;<i> in). I know this is part at least of what you were talking about when you
</I>&gt;<i> complained about having to maintain &quot;yet another build format&quot; with NAnt.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  This is just my opinion, but the IDE for someone like me is just at tool
</I>&gt;<i> for getting code from source control, editing it, and debugging. If IDEs
</I>&gt;<i> used a a platform-neutral project format (such as NAnt, or maybe some other
</I>&gt;<i> pluggable build environment I've yet to try) to determine which C# files are
</I>&gt;<i> actually in the project, how to build them, and which executable to debug -
</I>&gt;<i> but actually called into a platform-neutral build environment to do the real
</I>&gt;<i> compilation, this would seem to make managing cross-platform mono projects
</I>&gt;<i> alot easier. I can build consistently on every platform but the IDE only
</I>&gt;<i> comes into the picture if I need to edit code or debug.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>  I know with being focused on MD you probably are much more concerned with
</I>&gt;<i> getting the code to just work under linux let alone these issues I'm raising
</I>&gt;<i> so I apologize for not taking that into more consideration when reading your
</I>&gt;<i> initial feedback. I really do think you guys are doing a great job with what
</I>&gt;<i> you have created and this is part of why I am so seriously trying to factor
</I>&gt;<i> it into the grand scheme of how viable mono as a commercial platform for
</I>&gt;<i> applications I build over the next several years at my current employer is.
</I>&gt;<i> I have had no problem giving code back to open source projects when it helps
</I>&gt;<i> me ship product or my build process depends on it and would be glad to give
</I>&gt;<i> anything I create back that affects MD to help achieve these goals if I can
</I>&gt;<i> understand and see that MD's goals are inline with where I want to go etc.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Well if it doesn't make sense to switch build environments, I guess I

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; it out instead of working on getting the build to be more &quot;windows

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't think that anyone is currently working on getting MonoDevelop 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; working on windows.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe there is some lack of understanding here. MonoDevelop is a 100%
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; community driven project, people work on whatever they want. Right now,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there seem to be no contributors who are interested in seeing 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MonoDevelop work on win32. As with everything else that MonoDevelop
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could do, it is something the existing MonoDevelop team would love to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; see, and something they would help as best as possible, and accept
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; patches for, but at this time, it doesn't seem that anyone is interested 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in doing it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is how opensource works, if you want MonoDevelop to run on windows,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then grab an editor and get started, I can help point you in the right
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; direction (stuff like talking to Zac about what he got to, and pointing 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you into the known problem areas inside the code for running on win32)
