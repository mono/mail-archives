I don't think that anyone is currently working on getting MonoDevelop
working on windows.

Maybe there is some lack of understanding here. MonoDevelop is a 100%
community driven project, people work on whatever they want. Right now,
there seem to be no contributors who are interested in seeing
MonoDevelop work on win32. As with everything else that MonoDevelop
could do, it is something the existing MonoDevelop team would love to
see, and something they would help as best as possible, and accept
patches for, but at this time, it doesn't seem that anyone is interested
in doing it.

This is how opensource works, if you want MonoDevelop to run on windows,
then grab an editor and get started, I can help point you in the right
direction (stuff like talking to Zac about what he got to, and pointing
you into the known problem areas inside the code for running on win32)
