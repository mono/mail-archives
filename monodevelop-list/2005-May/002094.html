Sigh. Yet again, you miss the clue.

We would *love* to work on windows, but it will require some work. A lot
of the work has been done by Zac Bowling (make gecko# work on win32,
etc)

If someone wants to follow up with him and take up the cause, we would
love to take the patches in the tree, and put out a release that works
on win32 and on linux. Let me repeat that, *LOVE* to.

It seems like you feel, that in order to do this, MD would have to build
w/ NAnt instead of auto*. If that is the case, then that sounds like
where you should start. After you have all the things that we use in our
current make system working with NAnt, we will happily look at switching
over.
