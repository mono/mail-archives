What about all the people who don't like the way NAnt builds? Of which,
believe me, there are many, by switching to NAnt, dont we alienate them
as well?

As I said before, and others said, we are more than welcome to look at
switching building MD to NAnt, however, before we would do so, we would
have to see how NAnt handles things we use every day, like make run,
make install, make dist, make distcheck, make uninstall, the i18n
integration (to generate gmo files from po files) etc.

Now, if you want us to just blindly accept that you know best, and let
you do whatever you want, I think you are the one who is missing the
point. We just want to be informed, and so far, all you have been able
to inform us is that you are unable to actually read an email and reply
to it without attacking people who give away their work for free for
others to use. You have also shown us that your entire argument is
distilled down into &quot;Believe it or not, there are people who know
everything, and I happen to be one of them&quot;.

I am hoping that your next email (if any more come) will be one actually
addressing the technical issues that have been found with NAnt (And
guess what, and maybe this is a shocker, you are *not* the first person
to want to move MD to NAnt, plenty of others have tried, and they all
come up against the same set of issues. Interestingly enough, these are
the *EXACT* issues we have asked for more explanation with)

*shrug*
