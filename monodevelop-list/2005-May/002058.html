<PRE>Hi.

I am currently working on complete monodoc functionality as well as
providing functionality to jump to the declaration of a given use of a
variable in a source file.

With the current Resolver class this is not easily done since it uses
the ReturnType class (which basically equals a fully qualified name)
all over the place. I have been coding a bit and have many parts of
the monodoc functionality working, but it all ends up with a lot of
code duplication which is NOT very nice.

So... I am thinking about changing the Resolver class as well as the
TypeVisitor class to return a new class (instead of ReturnType) with
more information than what the ReturnType class currently contains.
This informatin should include:

The type of member (method, event, class, property etc.): this will be
useful for tool tips as well as generating monodoc references.

The location: this will be useful for the jump to declaration functionality.

And possibly more.

I think this is the way it should be done, but I am a bit worried that
a LOT of code needs to be changed in order to prepare for this new
functionality. Does anyone with more insight in these specific classes
have any comments, suggestions for another solution, or do you think
this is the way to go?

/Jacob
