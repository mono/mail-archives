<PRE>Ok now this is starting to make some more sense. I can see the time taken 
switchover being negative, that's why I offered to help with prototyping the 
effort. Assuming the internationalization stuff Todd mentioned could be 
invoked from NAnt though, for the parts of your build process centered 
around compilation of code, execution of tests, and deployment it would 
definately reduce your maintainability because NAnt has alot of pattern 
matching features and for/each like tasks that let you automate calling into 
sub-builds (similar to make) but without having to include every single file 
and run auto* all the time. I guess my thought was that NAnt works on osx, 
linux, and windows today and that people who have used mono or the .NET 
framework on these platforms can install NAnt easier. Hearing that a goal of 
monodevelop is not to run on windows, I can see this probably doesn't 
matter, or make sense.

Having said all that, are there any projects you guys know of (even just 
starting up) that have a mono IDE targeting windows along with linux out 
there? It's really lame IMHO to have to use one IDE in linux, another on 
windows etc. I can see how you guys who don't use Windows don't care but 
there are definately software vendors such as myself who want to allow 
customers to deploy their applications on any mono-supported platform (or at 
least the main &quot;3&quot;) and we would like to be able to use one IDE to develop 
and debug on all of these. Mono is perfectly capable of providing the APIs 
out of the shoot to do this, I'm surprised noone's tackled it yet.
