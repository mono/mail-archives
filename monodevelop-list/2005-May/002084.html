<PRE>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, if you want us to just blindly accept that you know best, and let
</I>&gt;<i> you do whatever you want, I think you are the one who is missing the
</I>&gt;<i> point. We just want to be informed, and so far, all you have been able
</I>&gt;<i> to inform us is that you are unable to actually read an email and reply
</I>&gt;<i> to it without attacking people who give away their work for free for
</I>&gt;<i> others to use. 
</I>

I only began &quot;attacking&quot; because your original reply was very &quot;I don't give 
a crap&quot; in nature. Read it and tell me it can be interpreted any other way.

You have also shown us that your entire argument is
&gt;<i> distilled down into &quot;Believe it or not, there are people who know
</I>&gt;<i> everything, and I happen to be one of them&quot;.
</I>

This is a total exaggeration. I am trying to underscore that your attitude 
(detailed above) gives readers such as myself the impression that you think 
you know everything, have looked at everything, are not willing to look at 
something that was a problem before, and don't care about community 
envolvement from others. I never said I know everything - I said there are 
others who may know things better than you. If you would read my words and 
not extrapolate your own meaning, you wouldn't need to make this judgement 
incorrectly.

I am hoping that your next email (if any more come) will be one actually
&gt;<i> addressing the technical issues that have been found with NAnt (And
</I>&gt;<i> guess what, and maybe this is a shocker, you are *not* the first person
</I>&gt;<i> to want to move MD to NAnt, plenty of others have tried, and they all
</I>&gt;<i> come up against the same set of issues. Interestingly enough, these are
</I>&gt;<i> the *EXACT* issues we have asked for more explanation with)
</I>


I need more clarification with what these issues are. NAnt can build code, 
create a distribution tree, run your code, run unit tests on it, package it 
for distribution (ala tarball / daily snapshot) and compile localized resx 
files, clean a build or install, and check for dependent assemblies 
presence. If there is anything you mentioned not covered by this please 
clarify. I'm not sure what the i18n gmo file generation does for you guys 
that you couldn't do with one of the CLRs localization technologies - 
perhaps I'm missing something.
