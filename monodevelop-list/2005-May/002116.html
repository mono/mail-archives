<PRE>Hi,

As Todd said, the code in Extras/MonoDeveloperExtensions is a good
starting point. Basically, you need to create a class that implements
IFileFormat. This class will be in charge of building a Project instance
from the NAnt build file.

In fact, some time ago I started writing such file format as a proof of
concept. I never finished it (it only supports writing, not reading),
but it can give you some clues. I'm attaching it to the mail.

You need to create a Project subclass (a NAntProject) only if you want
to override the Build and Run commands (for example, if you want the
build command to actually execute a target of the build file).

You don't need a Project subclass if you want to use the NAnt file just
as a file format (in this case, MD will use its internal build system
for building the project). However, right now there is no GUI for
setting the file format of a project, that's something that should also
be done.

BTW, all this can be done for solutions (combines) as well as for
projects.

Lluis.
