It doesn't seem to quite work for me, perhaps just by chance of how I
tested it.  But reading through the code it looks like a reasonable
place for it.  I'll hold off any detailed comments until the next
version.  I do think it would make since to go ahead and do the goto
method, field, etc. in the same patch.

I think we definitely want to have better navigation through the code by
both keyboard and mouse click like someone else mentioned.  In addition
to GotoDefinition on mouse over we could display &quot;hover-hints&quot; if we can
look up the type.

I'm not sure anyone else has any concrete requirements on where we are
heading in this area but the general approach is fine with me.
