<PRE>Hi.

Just wanted to comment on the windows thing. In my opinion it would be
nice if MonoDevelop worked on Windows, but I do not see it as a
priority. If someone would like to maintain/assure that MonoDevelop
could run on Windows it would be very cool, but focus should  be on
maturing MonoDevelop for Linux not compatibility with Windows.

</I>&gt;<i>  Having said all that, are there any projects you guys know of (even just

</I>&gt;<i> least the main &quot;3&quot;) and we would like to be able to use one IDE to develop
</I>&gt;<i> and debug on all of these. Mono is perfectly capable of providing the APIs
</I>&gt;<i> out of the shoot to do this, I'm surprised noone's tackled it yet.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - I (and most of us) am aware of nant 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - I prefer make right now
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - changing to anything else would have to provide _clear_ advantages
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and not make things harder to maintain (the very nature of switching is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time consuming so it starts out as a negative) 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I personally don't see the point until and if we can switch to something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; somewhat standardized between other similar ides and platforms (which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; currently doesn't exist).
