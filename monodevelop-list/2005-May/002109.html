Except ours.

Go look into it, you could write a NAntProject class that allows a user
to open a NAnt build file *AS* the project file.

Lluis has done so with the mcs *.sources files with great success.

Like I said initially, it sounded like you were interested in opening
NAnt files w/ MD, not building MD w/ NAnt.

Note, that if you were able to make the NAntProject work well, and be
flexible, there would finally be a potential advantage to making MD
build w/ NAnt, because then our project/build files would be the same
files. However, I think doing this and getting the flexibility you need
might be difficult, but I welcome you to try :)
