Yes, there is a whole placeholder portion of the dock that is not
complete yet that is causing a few bugs like this. See the TODO file for
it and feel free to ask any questions if you want to take a crack at it.
I have a partial patch for it which is basically removing the Automatic
flag from DockPlaceholder and then fixing regressions.

&gt;<i> Oh, and another question. Is there any planning going on to find out

</I>
Mostly in bugzilla, there is some stuff on the wiki but it seems down.

&gt;<i> One last thing. :-) I see there is a solution file for
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop.Dock. Shouldn't there be one for each assembly? Would be

</I>
Yes, there is only a lingering issue of keeping the project files in
sync with the auto* stuff, but I think we should just add them now to
encourage their use.
