<PRE>Well here is the point:
 
In the context of creating the MonoDevelop build system, yes I only care
&gt;<i> about the MonoDevelop team.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I would think in creating an open source project for a technology that was 
created to save customers money and relieve them from pressure by a market 
bully (Microsoft), one of your concerns might be broadening the reach of 
community contribution to the codebase so those customers can start being 
more productive with their OWN code. Saying &quot;you can only contribute to 
monodevelop if you like the way we build&quot; alienates you from help by other 
people who might be on Windows, or more comfortable with MSBuild, NAnt etc. 
and have been writing C# code alot longer than you (I know, it might 
surprise you there are some people like this out there). If you want to do 
it all yourself, continue as planned and good luck. It's just a shame that 
you are wasting the potential help from so many other people.
