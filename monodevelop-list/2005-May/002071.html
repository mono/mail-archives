Where can I download a copy of NAnt that works with mono 1.1.7, the
couple times I have tried I have been very unsucessful.

Like it or not, installing auto* is far far easier than installing NAnt,
and until it becomes *easier* to install auto* than NAnt, I don't see
MonoDevelop switching.

As much as you may think that moving to NAnt makes MD easier to build,
the sad fact is that it makes it easier for 10 people to build and
impossible for the rest.

In my experience with NAnt on mono, dating from the very very early mono
0.21 days to today, NAnt fails to function half the time, and when it
does, it is painfully slow compared to using auto*.


Now, to get to your original question about moving MD to Nant, I dont
think it is even a good idea, NAnt installation issues aside.

If you could explain what it gives us, maybe you could make a better
case, and IMO a svn-task that does the checkout, and the make seems
pretty lame as 'what it gives us'. I can write a 4 line shell script
that gives us exactly the same thing.

Considering that NAnt doesnt support things such as make dist, and make
dist-check, or any of the po/ integration that we do w/ intltool, etc.
We would be losing a lot of functionality.

And before you bring up that we could have all 3 build systems in the
tree (make, nant, and *.md[s|p]) i will stop you there. I am loathe to
introduce a second (.md[s|p]) and absolutely against introducing a
third.

So, just as a summary, until NAnt is

1) Easy to install, and runs 100% of the time
2) Able to do everything our current build scripts do, not just build,
but help w/ i18n, make dist, and make dist-check, support make run, and
make install.

there is no way I would even look into accepting this is a viable
change. That said, I wish you luck in getting NAnt to that stage.
