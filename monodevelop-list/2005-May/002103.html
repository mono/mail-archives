no.

mono on linux only

&gt;<i> SD is currently v1.1, MD is v0.X . Does that mean than the forking is

</I>
no, the forking is done.

&gt;<i> Is MD stuffed with the integrated nant [build tool] and code completion
</I>&gt;<i> plugins SD has ?
</I>
nant support is beta, and no one is working on it ATM, and we have the
same completion plugins afaik, not sure though.

&gt;<i> Is there code exchange between the two projects ? I have been studying

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
nope, not at all, we have done a lot of things differently.
