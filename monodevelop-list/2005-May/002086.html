The 'whole purpose of mono' is not portability. It is (like most things)
different things to different people.  I mean if we (MonoDevelop in this
case) really wanted to just 'be portable' we could, but we consciously
chose to take advantage of platform specific features. This is not a bad
thing.

The whole rest of this thread I didn't really read because it got off
track.  But what I want to try to make clear is:
 - I (and most of us) am aware of nant
 - I prefer make right now
 - changing to anything else would have to provide _clear_ advantages
 and not make things harder to maintain (the very nature of switching is
time consuming so it starts out as a negative)
 
I personally don't see the point until and if we can switch to something
somewhat standardized between other similar ides and platforms (which
currently doesn't exist).
