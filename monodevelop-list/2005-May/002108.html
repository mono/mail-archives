<PRE>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think that from summarizing your needs the best approach would be to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have a MD builder, a console utility, detached from MD that takes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; .mds/.mdp files and just compiles them, using platform-neutral
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; managed code. I would refactor that part of MD into a library, called
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by MD and by this console 'mdbuild' (?).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The problems I see are:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1-- .mds/.mdb files format aren't stable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2-- MD plugins may interfere (They need to follow some stricter design
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rules, like having no-UI, to be usable as nice 'tasks' in this build
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; system).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Just some wild thoughts,
</I>


Yes this is almost the same thing as having an NAnt addin for MD. The 
difference between what I'm looking for though and how other IDE's such as 
SharpDevelop have done it is that there needs to be some sort of way that 
this project file (MDB, NAnt .build, whatever) tells the IDE (through 
perhaps some extra XML attributes in the project's markup that are assigned 
to an XML namespace other than what NAnt expects and only &quot;picked up&quot; by the 
IDE) what executable to debug - as well as a way that the IDE can get the 
list of files included in the project to allow editing of. 

NAnt uses a simple pattern matching syntax (for example, compile 
src/MyProject/**.cs includes recursively all cs files below src/MyProject) 
that can be invoked through NAnt's API - this could allow an IDE to 
theoretically apply the pattern, get back the list of files that match the 
pattern, and show them as the list of files in the project. However all 
IDE's addin layers I've seen up to this point aren't flexible enough to 
support this yet.

Just curious,

-Jayme
