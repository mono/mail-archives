In theory. Translation - uneducated excuse. 


Dude. MD *NEVER WORKED ON WINDOWS*
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> NEVER
</I>

Hrm I was certain a 1.0x release included monodevelop. It must have been an 
RPM build on my linux box - you would know.

&gt;<i> We have that, .mdp and .mds
</I>

These are standard formats? Why reinvent the wheel?

&gt;<i> -Access to a ton of tasks that will exercise everything in the .NET
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; framework plus many open source tools that when used by monodevelop 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can make the IDE even more attractive
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Um, distill that into english, not marketing blah. That means nothing to
</I>&gt;<i> me as a developer. and I doubt nant gets us that too easily.
</I>

It may mean nothing to you as a developer - but people want to use mono (and 
your IDE) to write software applications. Some of these software 
applications might, god forbid, want to use the other tools included with 
mono that are not visual (read - command line) and not exposed through 
monodevelop. If you dont care, then you obviously care only about your own 
productivity and not the other developers who SHOULD be wanting to use your 
IDE. With this attitude I understand why you look at monodevelop as a &quot;for 
fun&quot; product. Why not just shut the thing down now and create a real project 
that bears the moniker &quot;mono&quot; in the name for those of us who would like to 
create software that makes money on mono instead of playing tinker toys with 
your side job priorities. I don't think Novell created mono &quot;for fun&quot;.


That has never been our intent, we want to provide linux users with a
&gt;<i> good IDE to do C# work in, not convert #D users to use an IDE that 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't even run on their host platform.
</I>

Well my bad that it's beyond your technical abilities to recognize that 
using strictly Gtk# could make your IDE run on all platforms that support 
mono. Your being as ignorant as Microsoft to tie it to linux. 

&gt;<i> -A reason for the NAnt team to create turn-key distros for linux
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Uh. I guess... not really a win for anyone involved in MonoDevelop. 
</I>

Again you only care about the monodevelop team. I can see you've never 
written software for a customer, or if you have, there's a reason why your 
not anymore. 

&gt;<i> -Less lines of code in the build environment
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *wrong*
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You have no idea how much logic it would take to replicate make install, 
</I>&gt;<i> make run, make dist, and make distcheck.
</I>


I have a perfect idea, I just converted 4 of your build scripts dude and 
told you it halved the lines. Go ahead, tell me you've used Ant with Java 
and don't believe me again...

&gt;<i> -Better readability and validation of build files because they are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; well formed XML not just text 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> dude.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> make validates our makefiles.
</I>


So it prevents you from putting a typo in the file with your text editor? No 
it doesn't validate until you run. You can validate XML before you even save 
it - oh that's right you knew that because of your superior XML knowledge 
*rolls eyes*. 


And as far as a mono IDE depending on platform-specific code... well..
&gt;<i> auto* works fine on win32. look at SFW and cygwin please. 
</I>

So because you don't want to put a 5 meg installation (NAnt) dependency on 
your build and standardize it for all platforms that support mono, windows 
users should have to put the bloat that is cygwin on their box. If you had a 
clue you'd realize how ignorant this argument is. Obviously you don't. 

Get NAnt build files that do exactly what we do with the auto* build
&gt;<i> system, and we would happily look at switching. And because you didn't 
</I>&gt;<i> seem to see the list of things nant *doesnt* do for free, let me list it
</I>&gt;<i> again:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) i18n integration
</I>&gt;<i> 2) make dist
</I>&gt;<i> 3) make distcheck
</I>&gt;<i> 4) make run
</I>&gt;<i> 5) make install
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
What a sad day. Someone please tell me when a customer focused IDE project 
for mono is going to begin. This one's a waste of time...
