<PRE>I am pleased to announce that Smuxi 0.7 'Bianca' is out NOW! This is the
most exciting release since the initial public release in 2008.

This release contains 4 major highlights in addition to many other
enhancements and fixes:
Initial support for Twitter has been implemented. This will allow you
to send and receive tweets to the Twitter microblogging service. It
supports the friends timeline, replies view, and direct messages.
The character counter, Reply-To feature, and avatar support will follow
in later releases.

Smuxi is now able to flawlessly handle network connections with high
latency which are common with UMTS, WLAN, and busy DSL and cable lines.
All communication between the Smuxi frontend and the Smuxi server is now
done as a background task using threads. This gives Smuxi a very
responsive feel - just like a normal, locally running application -
even with difficult network conditions

The IRC experience has been significantly improved.  Smuxi will now
send all unrecognized commands transparently to the IRC server and will
show the reply directly to the user. In addition, the userlist and query
menu have been extended to include common CTCP actions.

Smuxi now ensures that the text colors used in the tabs are easily
readable, regardless of your GTK theme.  It does this by using the
proven-reliable color-contrast algorithm used by Smuxi 0.6.4.1 to
generate nick colors.

A full list of changes is included below.

What is it?
===========
Smuxi is an irssi-inspired, flexible, user-friendly and cross-platform
IRC client for sophisticated users, targeting the GNOME desktop.

Smuxi is based on the client-server model: The core application
(engine) can be placed onto a server which is connected to the Internet
around-the-clock; one or more frontends then connect to the core. This
way, the connection to IRC can be kept up even when all frontends have
been closed. The combination of screen and irssi served as example for
this architecture.

Smuxi also supports the regular single application mode. This behaves
like a typical IRC client; it doesn't need separate core management and
utilizes a local engine that is used by the local frontend client.
