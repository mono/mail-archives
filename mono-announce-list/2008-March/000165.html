<PRE>Hi,
    Allow me to introduce Beagle 0.3.4 and Libbeagle 0.3.4. This is
mostly a bugfix release and fixes several build problems, including
building with mono 1.9 and gnome-sharp 2.20. We have also upgraded to
Lucene.Net 2.1 which comes with speed and memory improvements. Your
data will automatically re-indexed; you have to regenerate static
indexes if you created any custom ones.

THE SHORT OF IT
---------------
To download the 0.3.4 release or learn more about Beagle, visit
the Beagle web page:
   <A HREF="http://beagle-project.org">http://beagle-project.org</A>

WHAT IS BEAGLE?
---------------
Beagle is a Linux desktop-independent service which transparently and
unobtrusively indexes your data in real-time.  For example:

* Files are immediately indexed when they are created, are re-indexed
 when they are modified, and are dropped from the index upon deletion.
* E-mails are indexed upon arrival.
* IM conversations are indexed as you chat, a line at a time.
* Web pages are indexed as you view them (with a browser extension).
* Notes and address-book entries are indexed as they are created.

Beagle supports many different data sources and file formats.  For a
complete listing, visit:
   <A HREF="http://beagle-project.org/Supported_Filetypes">http://beagle-project.org/Supported_Filetypes</A>

Beagle uses the Lucene indexing system from the Apache project and the
prodigious Doug Cutting, ported to .NET by George Aroush.

Beagle includes an optional GNOME-based graphical tool for searching
its indexes. Also included is an experimental web based search interface.

-----------------------------------
More below:
* Dependency changes
* Packaging changes
* API Changes
* New features
* Beagle bug fixes
* Libbeagle bug fixes
* Translation changes
* Known issues

NOTABLE CHANGES between 0.3.3 and 0.3.4
--------------------------------------------
[DEPENDENCY]
* Need Mono at least 1.2.4; recommended at least 1.9
* GMime-sharp recommended at least 2.2.16

[PACKAGING]
* All the global configuration files are now in a single place in
beagle/conf-data directory.

[API]
* Add API to set the number of words and the total length of the snippets.

[FEATURES]
* Move to Lucene.Net 2.1 (backported a faster analyzer and other improvements).
* Move query mapping (e.g. mappings for ext:, genre:) to a separate
user editable /etc/beagle/query-mapping.xml (global) and
~/.beagle/query-mapping.xml (local). beagled needs to be restarted to
read the new mappings.
* Expose a Hide/Show DBus interface for beagle-search.
* Firefox search bar plugin to query using beagle's web interface.
* Add a tool beagle-static-query to query beagle without starting
beagled. This is mainly meant for static indexes (like locate with the
system index, like mod for a monodoc index).
* Lots of beagle-search beautification.
* Add a query mapping &quot;filename:&quot; to query for filenames and words in
it (e.g. match My in MyFile.txt and My_File.txt).
* Enable the TeXinfo filter.
* Add a filter for .info files (including gz/bz2/lzma compressed info
files). manpages crawl rule now contains /usr/share/info.
* SIGUSR2 will now also print runtime debugging information of beagled.

[BUGFIX - beagle]
* Use the new Mono.Unix.UnixSignal if built with mono 1.9. This should
remove the last of the beagled/index-helper hangs during shutdown.
* Add the missing files for the firefox extension sidebar.
* Show a better error message if ~/.beagle is not found when the
firefox extension is started (should help debian #463922).
* Fixes #514252 (evo backends now explicitly reference glib-sharp)
* Fixes #509487 (use LANG=C when external programs are started from any filter)
* Fix build with mono 1.9 and gnome-sharp 2.20 (#514252, #518220)
* Fix property change indexing (renames, moves etc.) which broke in 0.3.0
* Fix our filter matching algorithm to correctly choose filters in the
right order and move to the next one if one filter fails.
* Fix file leak in ebuild filter.
* Clean up some tmp files which could have left behind during a corner case.
* Fix a startup crash in the Pidgin backend if the Pidgin log
directory is absent during beagled startup.
* Check for msgfmt in ./configure before building.
* Fix glib-critical warnings in libbeagle (and python bindings) when
snippets with empty fragments were sent by beagled.
* Fix some bugs in snippet due to which valid matches were not
included in the snippets.

[BUGFIX - libbeagle]
* Timeout in libbeagle if connection to beagled takes more than 5
secs. This will prevent hangs in konqueror/gtkfilechooser if beagled
is hanged for some reason.
* Do not throw error if scheduler information and index information is
empty since they can actually be empty.

[TRANSLATION]
* Spanish (Jorge Gonzalez)
* Polish (GNOME PL Team.)
* Basque (Inaki Larranaga Murgoitio)
* Italian (Gianvito Cavasoli)
* Japanese (Takeshi AIHANA)
* Norwegian bokm&#229;l (Kjartan Maraas)
* Finnish (Ilkka Tuohela)
* Catalan (Jordi Mas, Gil Forcada)
* Occitan (Yannig Marchegay)
* Swedish (Daniel Nylander)
* Brazilian Portuguese (Igor Soares)
* French (St&#233;phane Raimbault)
* British English (Philip Withnall)
* Hungarian (Gabor Kelemen)

KNOWN ISSUES
-------------------------

* Beagled might wake up the CPU even when idle. This is due to certain
limitations in mono.
* Presence of procmail log files in a users' KMail directory can cause
problems with GMime. This is fixed with GMime 2.2.16.
* Some users are reporting this crash in gmime &quot;gmime-ERROR **: file
gmime-stream-fs.c: line 280 (stream_seek): should not be reached&quot;: I
am told this is related to building gmime with LFS support.
* Some files and directories for users with a non-UTF8 locale might
not be correctly handled. We are working on this.
