<PRE>Hi,

I'm pleased to announce the release of Beagle 0.2.16.  This is strictly
a bug fix release.


THE SHORT OF IT
---------------

To download the 0.2.16 release or learn more about Beagle, visit
the Beagle web page:

    <A HREF="http://beagle-project.org">http://beagle-project.org</A>


WHAT IS BEAGLE?
---------------

Beagle is a Linux desktop-independent service which transparently and
unobtrusively indexes your data in real-time.  For example:

* Files are immediately indexed when they are created, are re-indexed
  when they are modified, and are dropped from the index upon deletion.
* E-mails are indexed upon arrival.
* IM conversations are indexed as you chat, a line at a time.
* Web pages are indexed as you view them (with a browser extension).

Beagle supports many different data sources and file formats.  For a
complete listing, visit:

    <A HREF="http://beagle-project.org/Supported_Filetypes">http://beagle-project.org/Supported_Filetypes</A>

Beagle uses the Lucene indexing system from the Apache project and the
prodigious Doug Cutting, ported to .NET by George Aroush.

Beagle includes an optional GNOME-based graphical tool for searching
its indexes.

DEPENDENCY HECK
---------------

The Beagle daemon requires at least:
* Mono 1.1.13.5
* glib-sharp 2.4.0
* GMime 2.2.0 
* libexif 0.5.7
* shared-mime-info
* sqlite 2.x or 3.3.1

The GNOME user interface requires:
* gtk-sharp 2.4.0
* gnome-sharp 2.4.0

To support all of Beagle's features and file formats, you should
also have:
* Mono 1.2.2 or better
* Firefox 1.5 or Epiphany
* Evolution-sharp 0.11.1 for Evolution Data Server 1.4 or 1.6,
  or 0.12.2 for EDS 1.8 or 1.9.
* libgsf 1.14.1
* gsf-sharp 0.8.1 from
  <A HREF="http://primates.ximian.com/~joe/gsf-sharp-0.8.1.tar.gz">http://primates.ximian.com/~joe/gsf-sharp-0.8.1.tar.gz</A>
* wv1 1.2.4
* pdfinfo and pdftotext from xpdf
* MPlayer or Totem 2.17.1
* Galago 0.5.x  
* Linux kernel 2.6.13 with inotify
* An inotify-enabled kernel.  Inotify is in the mainline Linux
  kernel as of 2.6.13.


NOTABLE CHANGES SINCE 0.2.15
----------------------------

* Roll back the Mono requirement to 1.1.13.5.  The .NET 2.0 support
  should be good enough in it, and it gives us access to more released
  distros (like Ubuntu Edgy and SUSE 10.1).

* Change our method of setting up limits on external extractor
  processes, because running JITted code in a child process sometimes
  causes runtime deadlocks.  [bgo #402065]

* Fix a problem in our Sqlite schema where Beagle could loop crawling
  directories that started with zeros.

* Correctly handle filter versions while indexing, so that if a filter
  is upgraded to index more information, those files will be
  reindexed.

* Fix a problem where KMail folders were not being indexed.  [bgo
  #391647 and #401767, bnc #238161]

* Fix an issue with the file system backend reporting that it is
  indexing even after it has finished.

* Fix an issue with the Evolution mail backend reporting that it is
  doing the initial crawl even if it is only reprocessing a changed
  mailbox.

* Fix an issue with the Konversation backend always reporting that it
  is indexing, prompting the info box in beagle-search.

* Many robustness improvements to the Konversation backend.

* Fixes to the image filter (extracting JFIF comments and IPTC data,
  among others).

* Fix a potential deadlock on PDF files that cause pdftotext to spam
  output to stderr.

* Fix the SVG filter to handle undeclared namespaces gracefully.
  [bgo #404787]

* Handle JavaScript comments inside HTML files properly.

* Workaround certain archive files that cause SharpZipLib to loop
  infinitely.  [bgo #402280]

* Fix bugs caused by a change in behavior after switching to the .NET
  2.0 profile, mostly date-related.

* Fixed a problem where beagle-crawl-system was not being properly
  generated at configure-time.  [bgo #401504]

* Translations:

  - [New] Dzongkha       (Pema Geyleg)
  - Brazilian Portuguese (Igor Pires Soares)
  - Catalan              (Jordi Mas)
  - Galician             (Ignacio Casal Quinteiro)
  - Japanese             (Takeshi Aihana)
  - Swedish              (Daniel Nylander)

Macdonald, Stephan Hegel, Rick Friedman.

KNOWN ISSUES
------------

The Thunderbird backend is memory hungry and buggy.  It is now disabled by
default, but can be reenabled by passing in --enable-thunderbird to
configure.

There are some race conditions that can occur with certain combinations of
file system operations.  In very rare cases it might be necessary to stop
and restart the daemon.

At this point in development, we cannot commit to stable APIs or file
formats.  You will almost certainly need to reindex your data at some
point in the future.
