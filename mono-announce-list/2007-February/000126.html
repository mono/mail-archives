<PRE>Mono 1.2.3 has been released, some highlights: 

Thanks to everyone using Moma and submitting their reports, we were able
to prioritize the work needed to get applications running. The top used
1,933 APIs have been implemented in this release as well as many bugs
fixed and performance increased. 

New Moma definition files. If you are using Moma to evaluate porting
your software, running it again will load the new API definitions. 

Mono debuts Rolf Bjarne's Visual Basic 8.0 compiler written completely
in Visual Basic 8. We are also shipping Seo Sanghyeon's IronPython
Community Edition. 

Some highlights: ASP.NET 2.0 is almost complete (WebParts are still
missing), a new System.Media implementation is included, SOAP 1.2 is now
supported, HttpListener does TLS/SSL, 2.0 System.Net.Sockets is
available, many Windows.Forms API fixes and improvements, improved
startup time, more ports and much ADO.NET 2.0 work. 

Please read the release notes for all the juicy details.

The software is available from <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Downloads">http://www.mono-project.com/Downloads</A>
