<PRE>Hello Managed Code Execution Fans!

	Mono 0.11 is out!

	This new version has new features:

	* Massive:

		* Ultrich Kunitz implemented the whole calendar set of
		  classes.  Yes, thats right.  The whole thing, with a
		  complete test suite.  Thanks Ultrich!

	* JIT/runtime features:

		* Martin's debugging framework is included (see web
		  site for details on how to use it). (Martin)

		* Transparent Proxy has been implemented for the
		  runtime (lets you run/debug/hack on remoting for Mono) (Dietmar)

		* Inline and constant folding/propagation support
		  in the JIT engine (Dietmar)

		* Profiling support for the JIT engine (--profile).

	* Cool runtime hacks, that made our compiler twice as fast:

		* New string rewrite: faster, speedier, leaner, cooler!

		  Paolo had been talking about a new string rewrite,
		  and super hacker Patrik Torstensson started the
		  implementation, Dietmar then switched the object
		  layout and the Mono team helped iron out a few of
		  the details.

		* New array reprensetation: Dan Lewis contributed a new
		  faster and smaller array implementation.

		* Improved Reflection.Emit: Paolo improved our
		  reflection emit code.

	* ADO.NET

		* Daniel Morgan, Rodrigo Moya have some pieces of the
		  Sql classes ready to run.  he first signs of life
		  this week (we can connect, insert rows; do transactions:
		  commit/rollback; SQL errors and exceptions work).

	* Http Runtime

		* The HTTP runtime (to be used by our ASP.NET implementation)
		  was contributed by Patrik Torstensson.  Patrik not only
		  contributed a massive ammount of classes, but he immediately
		  went on to implement ThreadPools and then helped out with the
		  new String rewrite.

	* XML improvements:

		* Kral Ferch and Duncan Mak contributed more
		  improvements to the XML implementation.

		* Work on Xml Serialization from John Donagher.
	
	* Documentation:

		* MonoDoc ships for the first time!
		  (John Barnette, Adam Treat and John Sohn)

		* New documentation stubs ready to be filled, and translated
		  included (thanks to our doc team!)

	* General fixes:

		* Piers Haken fixed many of our attributes and many
		  little problems that were exposed by his CorCompare tool

		* Many Mono C# compiler bug fixes.

	* Other improvements:

		* NUnit works on Linux! (Patrik Torstensson)

		* More NUnit tests (Nick Drochak)

		* Windows.Forms progress: Dennis Hayes and Christian
		  Meyer have been contributing stubs for the
		  Windows.Forms work.

		* Full Parse implementations and bug fixing by Gonzalo

		* Dan Lewis contributed some missing classes for the
		  Regexp implementation.

		* Jonathan's trace classes

* This Month's Mono is brought to you by:

	Adam Treat, Chris Podugriel, Christian Meyer, Daniel Lewis,
	Daniel Morgan, Dennis Hayes, Dick Porter, Dietmar Maurer,
	Duncan Mak, Guarav Vaish, Gonzalo Paniagua, Jaime Anguiano,
	Jason Diamond, Joe Shaw, John Barnette, John Donagher, John
	Sohn, Jonathan Pryor, Kral Ferch, Martin Baulig, Miguel de
	Icaza, Mike Kestner, Nick Drochak, Paolo Molaro, Patrik
	Tostensson, Piers Haken, Ravi Pratap, Rodrigo Moya, Sergey
	Chanben, Ultrich Kunitz, Wictor Wilen.

	I know that I missed some features, there is a lot of work
	that happens in a month.  I apologize in advance for any
	features I omited by accident.  

	Special thanks go to Duncan for helping out with all those
	little details in the project.  And also Nick who has been
	keeping us in good shape by maintaining and helping new
	contributors provide more test suites.

* Reporting bugs

	If you find a bug in Mono, please file a bug here:

		<A HREF="http://bugzilla.ximian.com">http://bugzilla.ximian.com</A>

	That way we wont loose your bug report, and will be able to
	follow up properly with it.  Also try to provide simple test
	cases whenever possible and try as hard as possible to
	identify the root of a problem (compiler, runtime, class
	libraries).

* Forum

	The <A HREF="mailto:mono-list-request@ximian.com">mono-list-request@ximian.com</A> mailing list is open for
	those of you who want to discuss the future of Mono.

Miguel.
