<PRE>Hi,

Mono 1.2.5 has been released.  Release notes are here:

<A HREF="http://go-mono.com/archive/1.2.5/">http://go-mono.com/archive/1.2.5/</A>

Downloads are available from:

<A HREF="http://mono-project.com/Downloads">http://mono-project.com/Downloads</A>

There are also rpms in the openSUSE Build Service (which has RPMS for
newer Fedora distros and suse factory):

<A HREF="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Mono/">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Mono/</A>


The vmware image has been updated with improvements of which several
were suggestions based on feedback we received.

-Browse Windows network from inside the VMware image (start nmb)
-smart installed as an optional/additional package manager
-System.Windows.Forms demos don't open a terminal any longer
(use .desktop files to call the wrapper scripts)
-SWF Demos updated
-Obsolete nGallery ASP.Net demo removed
-openSUSE 10.2 shipped with a version of Beagle that has some serious
bugs, so it was removed
-ext3 partition was set to never do consistency checks
-probably some more things that I forgot...


Thanks to all who tried out the preview releases and filed bugs against
it.

Enjoy!

Wade
