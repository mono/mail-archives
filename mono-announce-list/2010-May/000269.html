<PRE>Hi all,

As of today, we're going to change the versioning of F-Spot. Like pretty
much everyone else in the free/open-source world, we're going to adopt
the habit of having even release numbers for stable versions and
unstable ones for development versions.

This means that todays release of 0.6.2 is a stable one. There is also a
git branch called stable-0.6, which will be used to develop stable
releases. Stable releases will generally only contain maintenance
updates and won't break backwards compatibility. These will mainly
consist of backported bugfixes/features from the main development line
and driven by the request of distributions [1].

Development happens in the master branch, with snapshots being released
under uneven version numbers. Next up: 0.7.0.

We are planning quite heavy refactorings and fixes to put an end to our
larger problems. As such, more releases can be expected on the stable
branch should distributions want this.

Yours truly,
   Ruben


[1] This means: if you want to see something backported to stable, ask
us!
