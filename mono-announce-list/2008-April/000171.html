<PRE>Hi,
    I am pleased to announce Beagle 0.3.6. We fixed a major regression
introduced in 0.3.4 in which Tomboy notes were not indexed. Other than
that, this release comes with several new features, namely a GMail
search-only backend, a 'locate' based backend to supplement FileSystem
backend search results, updated Firefox extension for Firefox 3.0beta
and a command line 'blocate' to work just like locate but with beagle
indexes without beagled running. We also updated out image filters and
dropped libexif dependency.

THE SHORT OF IT
---------------
To download the 0.3.6 release or learn more about Beagle, visit
the Beagle web page:
   <A HREF="http://beagle-project.org">http://beagle-project.org</A>

WHAT IS BEAGLE?
---------------
Beagle is a Linux desktop-independent service which transparently and
unobtrusively indexes your data in real-time.  For example:

* Files are immediately indexed when they are created, are re-indexed
 when they are modified, and are dropped from the index upon deletion.
* E-mails are indexed upon arrival.
* IM conversations are indexed as you chat, a line at a time.
* Web pages are indexed as you view them (with a browser extension).
* Notes and address-book entries are indexed as they are created.

Beagle supports many different data sources and file formats.  For a
complete listing, visit:
   <A HREF="http://beagle-project.org/Supported_Filetypes">http://beagle-project.org/Supported_Filetypes</A>

Beagle uses the Lucene indexing system from the Apache project and the
prodigious Doug Cutting, ported to .NET by George Aroush.

Beagle includes an optional GNOME-based graphical tool for searching
its indexes. Also included is an experimental web based search interface.

NOTABLE CHANGES between 0.3.5 and 0.3.6
--------------------------------------------

* Fix regression in 0.3.4 (content of Tomboy notes were not indexed).
For bug-fix backports please merge r4656.

* Fix the network-service backend.

* Catch the galago dllnotfoundexception and prevent a crash (relevant
for Debian libgalago1.0-cil package).

* Update Firefox extension to Firefox 3.0.

* Use an icon from the Tomboy project for displaying note tiles in
beagle-search. Package this icon with beagle-search.

* Update F-Spot files from latest F-Spot svn trunk. Update the JPEG
filter to use the managed Tiff parser instead of libexif. Drop libexif
dependency.

* Display network search related options in beagle-settings.

* Add a GMail and Google Apps email live search backend. See
<A HREF="http://beagle-project.org/Live_GMail_Search">http://beagle-project.org/Live_GMail_Search</A> for details. This does not
index the emails itself but directly queries GMail. Apart from a
limited functionality, this will also submit user queries to Google
(note to people concerned with privacy). This backend can be packaged
separately by bundling GoogleBackends.xml and GoogleBackends.dll. The
backend is disabled by default.

* Add option to store and retrieve GMail password from KDE Wallet.

* Show query-domain selection menu in beagle-search. Replace
&quot;--network yes|no&quot; with &quot;--domain ...&quot; options in beagle-query for
full choice of query domains.

* Add a 'locate' based backend to supplement the FileSystem backend.
If enabled, results from 'locate' will also be returned except the
ones which are already returned by the FileSystem backend. The
FileSystem backend also has to be enabled for this backend to work.
This is only meant to be used when FileSystem backend is still
crawling or if results from the entire file system is desired; due to
several limitation in locate itself and in this backend, this backend
is disabled by default.

* Add 'blocate' - a 'locate' like tool to query static indexes without
running beagled. It is a wrapper to beagle-static-query and can be
configured using blocate.conf (globally at /etc/beagle and locally at
~/.beagle/config). blocate and beagle-update-index form the beagle
powered replacement for locate and updatedb.

* Translations:
 - Japanese (Takeshi AIHANA)
 - Spanish (Jorge Gonzalez)
 - Brazilian Portuguese (Igor Soares)
 - Swedish (Daniel Nylander)
