OSAF Hiring Wishlist

OSAF is looking for people of all shapes and sizes.  Obviously we would=20=

like to hire the best people we can find.  All people we are looking=20
for would:

=95 Live in San Francisco or be willing to commute to San Francisco =
three=20
days a week
=95 Have significant experience with object oriented languages
=95 Be able to understand and work with large bodies of code they did =
not=20
write without getting too cynical.
=95 Be fun to hang out with.

It would be nice, but not necessary for people to also have:

=95 Significant experience working with a functional language
=95 Python experience
=95 Strong contribution to other open source projects

As our plans for the future are still sketchy, it is impossible to=20
write complete job descriptions for the people we want to hire, we=20
would be happy to hire people with combinations of these skills.

User Interface Implementation.  Someone needs to turn the pretty=20
drawings into something which works spectacularly well.  This person=20
would ideally have worked on well though of end-user software on more=20
than one platform and be proud to show off her or his past work.

Network Internals Architect =96 Inside Chandler will be a  component=20
which manages asynchronous data streams from many different sources and=20=

provides the plumbing for Chandler.  We need someone who can design and=20=

implement this.

E-Mail data wizard.  We will need someone to evaluate exiting code for=20=

communicating with e-mail servers and parsing e-mail messsages, make a=20=

fix/build decision, and then hook it to the networking and data=20
repository frameworks.

wxPython platform wizard.  Someone who is familiar with with win32, gtk=20=

and mac toolbox who can help us polish wxwindows to be a modern ui=20
platform.

Toolkit implementor =96 Someone who has written a fair share of UI=20
toolkits in their life and would be interested in helping us extend=20
wWindows into a fairly high-level toolkit for data based applications.

Indexing expert.  Chandler will require full text indexes for=20
constantly changing data, we need someone to show us the way.

We will need rich text editing and HTML display in wxWindows.   Someone=20=

familiar with parts of this landscape who could take us where we need=20
to go would be excellent.  Gecko/Konqueror, CSS, XBL, XSL, yadda yadda=20=

yadda.

qa coordinator =96 eventually there will be some community based qa=20
effort with an osaf contact managing the work.  this person needs to be=20=

able to evaluate the quality of tests and to be fliexible in choosing=20
approaches to testing and verification.  It is unlikely that someone=20
from a QA organization will be able to do this job.

tech writer =96 it would be good to have someone who wrote well, it =
would=20
be nice if that person also had some other skill on this list

Another development manager.  We imagine the org chart will eventually=20=

require the hirhing of a second manager.  This person needs to be=20
organized enough to provide structure, but not so organized that they=20
provide calicification.=
