<PRE>Just in time, with the beginning of 2009 we are proud to announce the

0.6 series but also contains as usual new features for your joy of

What is it?
===========
Smuxi is an irssi-inspired, flexible, user-friendly and cross-platform
IRC client for advanced users, targeting the GNOME desktop.

The special feature of Smuxi is that it can be used like the typical
irssi+screen combo. The IRC session can run on a server (using
`smuxi-server') and a frontend (like `smuxi-frontend-gnome') then can
connect to that. The frontend can then be detached and re-attached at
some later point without losing any IRC connections or messages.

The project website can be found at:
<A HREF="http://www.smuxi.org/">http://www.smuxi.org/</A>

What's New?
===========
New features:
    * Full tray icon support. (trac#55 and trac#137)
    * Configurable line wrapping. (trac#5)
    * Events such as join/part/quit now use a different color in the
      tab label. (trac#66)
    * When connecting to a smuxi-server previous highlights will not be
      highlighted again. (trac#97)
    * Messages can now be sent to all chats by using
      the /amsg, /anotice and /ame commands. (trac#109)
    * The find group chats feature now indicates an active search by
      using a busy mouse cursor symbol. (trac#115)
    * Passwords are now hidden by default but can be shown by using a
      &quot;show password&quot; button. (trac#116)
    * Nicknames can now be listed by using the /names command.
      (trac#120) 

Bugfixes:

      disconnect. (trac#117)
    * Quitting smuxi using the window close button (X) will now store
      the last used window size and position. (trac#121)
    * Validation now requires a nickname be set in the preferences.
      (trac#123)
    * URL matching is now case-insensitive. (trac#131)
    * /quit command will no longer reconnect. (trac#139)
    * Username and password are now correctly used in the quick connect
      dialog. (trac#141)
    * When disconnecting from a server, all chats will now be closed.
      (trac#144)
