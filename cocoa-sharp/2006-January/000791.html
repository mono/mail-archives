I understand this fully. The subject we were discussing are the .ctor() 
or .ctor(non-IntPtr) constructors in the new, handcrafted classes. The 
concrete example was that in the current state of Cocoa# a class 
wishing to implement the data source protocol must, in addition to 
deriving from Cocoa.Object, call Initialize() in its constructor - and 
some users are not aware of this necessity, thus getting failures.
I had two propositions to tackle this: a) As an interim solution create 
a wrapper class DataSource or something that does the necessary stuff 
and provides stubs for the necessary methods.
b) Requiring some more work, I am writing a completely new Objective-C 
interop layer that allows having .NET classes that are not 
automatically registered as Objective-C classes, as currently done by 
Cocoa.Object's default constructor. The managed-wrapper-to-native 
direction is already working fine, wasn't too hard except for the 
vararg p/invoking issues, and I have just succeeded in adding 
Objective-C classes and methods and calling a managed IMP delegate 
through an Objective-C class instance without dirty hacks. So now I 
hope to have this completed by the weekend! :-)
