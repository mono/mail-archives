I was wondering anyway why Cocoa.Object doesn't implement IDisposable; 
if Cocoa# were able to detect a native Objective-C object being 
destructed it could just dispose its managed counterpart and have the 
Dispose method (instead of a finalizer) remove it from the map way 
before it is GC'ed/finalized.

Another way to control object lifetime would be to inherit from 
System.MarshalByRefObject and work with ILease but that may be too much 
overhead, don't know, i have only used it for .NET Remoting. And the 
inner workings of Cocoa# are still a big puzzle to me...
