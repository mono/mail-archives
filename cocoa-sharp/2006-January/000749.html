<PRE>Hi kangaroo,

It's getting late and I am running into more and more problems with 
View-derived classes. I believe I have located the source of all these 
crashes, unfortunately I do not know how to remedy this and need your 
opinion on this. Classes like TableView or some of my custom views are 
two derivation levels away from View; however the View(Rect) constructor 
calls objc_sendMsgSuper[_stret] uses only the immediate superclass 
instead of a superclass calculated from the &quot;distance&quot; of the instance's 
class to the class represented by the constructor sending the message. 
This way I have been working with uninitialized instances, which was 
working for some classes only.

To make this more clear:

View - .ctor(Rect) calls objc_sendMsgSuper for initWithFrame:
  AView - derives from View, an AView is constructed correctly

View
  AView - derives from View
    BView - derives from AView, an instance of BView is not constructed 
correctly because initWithFrame: is incorrectly being called on AView 
instead of View

Any idea how we can fix this behavior? I need this working urgently!
I fear that some reorganization of ObjCMessaging.objc_sendMsgSuper will 
be necessary for this; for instance, instead of passing the current 
instance and having superclass called on it we might need to also pass 
in the superclass as an argument. Thoughts?

Andreas
