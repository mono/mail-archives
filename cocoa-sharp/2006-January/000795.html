<PRE>Ok, I want to ask you ObjC guru's out there a question...
I'm currently working on this -&gt; - (id)initImageCell:(NSImage *)anImage

 From what I've been able to learn from internet sources, the return  
type of (id) means that it's a dynamic object pointer, meaning that  
the object doesn't have to be of a particular class...is that right?

I just want to also ask about what the different  
ObjCMessaging.objc_msgSend are for:

The first one:
public static object objc_msgSend (IntPtr receiver, string selector,  
Type rettype)

So from what I gather the first one is for items that return  
something but have no parameters.  The first passed arg is the  
NativeObject, the second one is the property/method/etc, and the  
third one is the return type.  Is this correct?

The second one:
public static object objc_msgSend (IntPtr receiver, string selector,  
Type rettype, params object[] args)

  This one is for items that have parameters, which must be the last  
item....I have to look up the params keyword.  I don't think I've  
ever seen that before.

So in converting the ObjC statement I supplied earlier would you tell  
me if this is correct?

public Cocoa.Cell InitImageCell( Cocoa.Image anImage ) {
	return (Cocoa.Cell)Native.NativeToManaged ((IntPtr) 
ObjCMessaging.objc_msgSend( NativeObject, &quot;initImageCell&quot;, typeof  
(IntPtr), typeof (Cocoa.Image), anImage )));
}

I noticed that Native.NativeToManaged is ALWAYS used, is that always  
the case or is that just coincidence for now?  Now the &quot;typeof  
(IntPtr)&quot; that is right before the typeof (Cocoa.Image), should that  
be the IntPtr because it's returning a pointer to a dynamic object?

Am I grasping any of this correctly? :)

In the real world;
as in dreams.
Nothing is quite;
what it seems.
