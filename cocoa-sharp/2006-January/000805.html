<PRE>Hi guys,

Recent I reported some Mach exception handling issues, especially that 
the thread is never stopped in command line applications (including 
NUnit tests). Having managed to get my application running on my new 
implementation (without the previously observed failures with gmcs), I 
have now found out why a Cocoa# AppKit application exits nontheless, 
and it is quite disturbing...:

By calling [[NSApplication sharedApplication] run] (Application.Run()) 
we are passing control out to unmanaged code which through the bridge 
calls back into our managed code. However when the application is quit, 
control is not tranferred back to our managed Main function that called 
it!
Instead native Cocoa is calling the C exit() function (or equivalent) 
on its own, causing Mono to be &quot;killed&quot; without any garbage 
collection!!!
This is bad.

I've tried playing around with Application a little and we can catch 
two delegates, shouldTerminate and willTerminate (names shortened).
Processing can happen in the latter but the process of terminating the 
hard way cannot be stopped or changed there, except for calling 
Environment.Exit(0) which doesn't return to Main either. This would be 
an improvement for our managed code but I do not know the implications 
for Cocoa - anyone?
The other way would be to the should delegate: returning Later halts 
the main loop which appears to be bad ... returning Cancel allows to 
call stop and exit the run loop, returning to the Main function, but 
the windows stay on screen and are only removed later on.
With Cocoa being unmanaged code we can't just revoke a CAS permission 
to exit! ;-)

Any ideas?

Andreas
