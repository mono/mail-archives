<PRE>I just read this archived message today and wanted to add an opinion  
from a users perspective....

As for renaming Namespaces, thats not such a big deal since there  
aren't many apps out there that are using cocoa-sharp heavily, I've  
got a couple, but they are just little things I've started and not  
finished.

One big thing, I would love to see cocoa-sharp site running media- 
wiki, if I had read that archive 3 days ago I coulda given you a real  
nice skin I designed for my own site and it would a fit well with  
Cocoa#, but I formatted and I didn't back it up :(  I find that  
MediaWiki is alot easier.....just my opinion.

Ok, thats all...the rest of your stuff I didn't understand so I won't  
even bother to comment :)

I did try something, I took a look at the source for Cocoa.Window, I  
was wanting to try and create the class Cocoa.WindowController so I  
could use sheets in one of my programs, I figured it can't be to  
hard....hrm...how the heck do you guys know what your doing,  
lol...none of it makes sense...I'd love to help write code but I'm  
afraid I'm a little dense when it comes to this kinda code, lol :)

Thanks,
Tim
