<PRE>Hi everyone, and a Happy New Year,

Cocoa# has made some big progress in 2005. A big thanks to kangaroo for 
his work on Cocoa# and for answering my annoying questions.

Personally I believe that Cocoa# is on a good track right now with the 
new Objective-C Interop and the more CLR-style, hand-crafted classes. In 
simple scenarios this is already working like a charm, and if everyone 
contributes what he/she needs then this should add up to a relatively 
complete class library.

Now, as Cocoa# is growing I have been thinking about some aspects and 
would like to post them here for controvertial discussion.

I really like the new namespace structure that does not have the name 
Apple in it, not being written by Apple. However with more and more 
classes arriving I am proposing to split the classes up (again) into 
Cocoa (OC interop and Foundation), Cocoa.AppKit (the name says it all, 
equivalent of Apple.AppKit) and rename WebKit to Cocoa.WebKit 
(equivalent of Apple.WebKit). Possibly also move the Interop stuff to 
Cocoa.Interop. This could all remain inside the existing two Assemblies 
- cosmetics that could improve the documentation and src/Cocoa directory.

I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on what Cocoa#'s position should 
be regarding other frameworks. I might be interested in using for 
instance Bonjour or Bluetooth in the future. Would I have to create my 
own wrapper, or would such additional frameworks be of general interest 
as Assemblies within Cocoa# SVN?

For /users/ to more easily work with the new Cocoa# I believe it is 
essential to get documentation in an easy-to-view form to the users. If 
we are not willing to release CocoaDoc officially yet then we could 
release snapshots for local browsing of the official documentation. And 
on the Web the documentation of the latest released version of Cocoa# 
should be integrated into <A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/docs/.">http://www.go-mono.com/docs/.</A> There is 
basically no point in writing documentation that is virtually 
inaccessible for those for whom it is intended. Maybe we should also add 
a migration guide for previous users of Cocoa# to the documentation or 
the Wiki. Maybe even reference the Wiki from Monodoc, is that possible?

For many people to /contribute/ to Cocoa# we should make it easier for 
people to do so. I have started the HOWTO in the Cocoa# Wiki as one 
means of getting people jumpstarted with SVN build and contribution. It 
is not very extensive and will need our updates to be even more helpful. 
Some other thoughts are:
* add an autogen.sh launch script for general users to eliminate the 
need for lengthy command line options - I've written one myself and 
could rewrite that as a patch
* an update-docs target in the main Makefile that calls &quot;make update&quot; 
within doc/ (to avoid needing to change in and out of the directory 
manually)
* working Cocoa# documentation in CocoaDoc that can easily be updated 
through some Makefile target to immediately review the changes we have made
* some more verbose and .NET-style renaming: ObjCMessaging.objc_msgSend 
to .SendMessage; Native.*ToManaged to an overloaded .ToManaged(*); - I 
would volunteer for such a task
* maybe create a Converter or something more similar to Microsoft's 
Interop marshalling?

Some other areas where I see a need for /improvements/ are:
* solving the mysterious Main function crash and fixing it - I believe 
this may be related to Cocoa# initialization...
* solving the Bundle-related problems - what exactly is the problem 
here: is it looking in /bin/ or in /L/F/M/V/C/bin/ or somewhere else? or 
is not at all because we do not start as a regular Cocoa app? I would 
rather have this working 100% natively than starting to commit little 
patches that remedy some (but not all) side-effects.
* test arguments of our methods and make them compatible with null 
values where applicable - value.NativeObject or similar constructs have 
already been causing problems for me; can't we use Cocoa.Object 
parameters for objc_msgSend instead of IntPtr and have them translated 
(value == null) ? IntPtr.Zero : value.NativeObject in a central place?

Then the big question: How much CLR and how much Objective-C do we want 
Cocoa# to be?
I do like the new CLR-style event handling in Control that has made it 
into SVN and I would appreciate if we could avoid as much Objective-C as 
possible in user-derived classes or instances.
Might it be possible to avoid needing the ExportAttribute outside the 
Cocoa# Assemblies for standard apps? I believe passing a delegate to a 
function is an improvement over passing target and selector but maybe we 
can improve this even further so that a delegate is called with CLR 
semantics only and does not need to be exported?

The above list is most likely not complete and was not intended to be; 
please feel free to post your thoughts on these or any additional 
related topics.

Regards,

Andreas
