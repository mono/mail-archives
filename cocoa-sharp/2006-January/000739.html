<PRE>Hi,

&gt;&gt;<i> with more and  more classes arriving I am proposing to split the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> classes up  (again) into Cocoa (OC interop and Foundation), 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cocoa.AppKit (the  name says it all, equivalent of Apple.AppKit) and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rename WebKit to  Cocoa.WebKit (equivalent of Apple.WebKit). Possibly 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also move the  Interop stuff to Cocoa.Interop. This could all remain 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inside the  existing two Assemblies - cosmetics that could improve 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the  documentation and src/Cocoa directory.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm adverse to renaming namespaces _again_ forcing everyones code to  
</I>&gt;<i> be changed _again_.  That being said; I have no problem with a  
</I>&gt;<i> Cocoa.Interop sub-namespace with a bunch of Interop stuff in it.   
</I>&gt;<i> Without a &quot;good reason&quot; I'd like to avoid renaming namespaces again.
</I>
Well, my motivation was to resemble both the .NET class library and 
Cocoa API structure. In both, base types are separated from user 
interface classes, making it easier to look through the documentation 
when looking for some kind of control or UI element without tripping 
over core classes.
Like some of the other changes I would be willing to provide a patch 
once Aaron and you have applied your respective patches; this way the 
only difference for up-to-date end users apart from improved 
documentation would be an additional &quot;using Cocoa.AppKit;&quot;. It might 
also make it easier for everyone still migrating from the old Cocoa# - 
they would only have to replace &quot;Apple&quot; by &quot;Cocoa&quot; and &quot;NS&quot; by empty string.
Not to mention that you yourself just said we were not providing API 
stability yet. :-)

&gt;&gt;<i> I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on what Cocoa#'s position  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be regarding other frameworks. I might be interested in  using 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for instance Bonjour or Bluetooth in the future. Would I have  to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> create my own wrapper, or would such additional frameworks be of  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> general interest as Assemblies within Cocoa# SVN?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As above; if we (people working on cocoa#) want to work on creating  
</I>&gt;<i> these packages and they have a logical fit into the cocoa# project;  
</I>&gt;<i> they can go in.  Bonjour I dont think fits in this (as it can bind to  
</I>&gt;<i> zeroconf on linux); but mac bluetooth integration would.  Make sense?
</I>
I am not really knowledgeable about Bonjour, was more referring to the 
general idea. I wasn't aware of the Linux side but true it is also 
available for Windows.

Still I like the paradigm of having native support of certain things. I 
don't like System.Drawing/libgdiplus on Mac, it's okay on Linux but X11 
is not installed on the Mac by default and still lots of applications 
can draw, also I do not have harddrive capacity for X11 left, so I will 
want to add Mac-platform-dependent support for drawing and printing in 
Cocoa# as started by you with BezierPath.FillRect. OpenGL too is 
something that is available on other platforms as well, yet I like the 
idea of having it on the Mac like native apps when writing Mac-only code.

Bluetooth is available on Linux and Windows as well through the BlueZ, 
Microsoft, Widcomm and whatsoever stacks there might be around. Still 
neither Microsoft nor anyone else apart from OpenNETCF.org seems to have 
a standardized managed Bluetooth interface. So wouldn't it be thinkable 
to create a managed ObjC interop assembly for a certain framework and 
have another assembly use that managed assembly to create some kind of 
wrapper when necessary? Otherwise the structural differences between the 
different platforms are often significant - C and COM on Windows, C on 
Linux, Objective-C on Mac - it's not just ifdeffing some small parts in 
and out. If anyone has any thoughts on the topic of Bluetooth 
interfaces, Marcel from BlueZ.org was looking into the idea of a managed 
wrapper assembly recently but appeared to postpone that due to the lack 
of a standard CLR interface.

&gt;<i> I'll look into getting the current documentation on go-mono.com/docs;
</I>
That would be great.

&gt;<i>   if not maybe we can run a monodoc aspx for cocoadoc on  cocoasharp.org;
</I>
That would be fine too.

&gt;<i> As for the wiki; pretty much everything there is out of date; it may  
</I>&gt;<i> be smart to just start again?  Thoughts?
</I>
I vote against. Lots of stuff is out-of-date, yes, but some parts have 
really been helpful for someone starting with Cocoa/Cocoa# and possibly 
the Mac. We should keep at least some content in whatever form that may be.

What I would support though is a move to an improved or different Wiki 
software ... for instance it seems impossible to both mark something 
camel-cased as not-a-link and apply some formatting. Also a login 
capability with the ability to remove one's own pages would be handy (I 
created a page with a space in the name and was therefore unable to link 
to it).
Mono-project.com appears to be using the MediaWiki, like Wikipedia.

Oh, and the CocoaSharp.org and Mono CocoaSharp pages need to be updated!

&gt;&gt;<i> * add an autogen.sh launch script for general users to eliminate  the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need for lengthy command line options - I've written one myself  and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could rewrite that as a patch
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is probably ok.  I'd have to see the patch.
</I>
No patch yet but see the attached script, I call it from within the 
cocoa-sharp folder.

&gt;&gt;<i> * working Cocoa# documentation in CocoaDoc that can easily be  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> updated through some Makefile target to immediately review the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changes we have made
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This isn't hard; I've got osomething that does this buried in my  
</I>&gt;<i> trees somewhere.
</I>
It probably boils down to removing an existing CocoaDoc.app within that 
target first (right now I have to delete it manually before make) and 
adding a dependency on cocoa-sharp.zip so that it gets macpacked when 
that changes.

&gt;&gt;<i> * some more verbose and .NET-style renaming:  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ObjCMessaging.objc_msgSend to .SendMessage; Native.*ToManaged to an  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> overloaded .ToManaged(*); - I would volunteer for such a task
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * maybe create a Converter or something more similar to Microsoft's  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Interop marshalling?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No problem with these changes as long as they aren't &quot;make work&quot;  changes.
</I>
If we coordinated such an effort I could provide a patch that does the 
necessary changes inside Cocoa#, just like above. The earlier we get 
such changes in, the easier for us.

On second thoughts, do you have a better suggestion than 
ObjC*Messaging*.Send*Message*? Or maybe rename it as suggested but add 
an additional static method in Object (from which most of our classes 
are derived)? My intent is to shorten the amount of code needed to send 
the messages in our functions and to make them a little more readable.

&gt;&gt;<i> * solving the mysterious Main function crash and fixing it - I  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> believe this may be related to Cocoa# initialization...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Get me an example or testcase that shows this; I've never seen this.
</I>
With the previous version of Cocoa# you have instructed people to derive 
the main class of my minimal tutorial in the Wiki from NSObject although 
it only contained a static Main method, there was a discussion about 
problems apparently caused by that for some users but you didn't answer 
my question why that might be necessary for a static method. I didn't 
face the problem at that time myself.
Same phenomenon however has appeared and disappeared with the new 
version so that I was so far unable to locate the cause. One possible 
explanation that occurred to me was that maybe the static initialization 
of Cocoa.Object (caused by the derivation from Object) might have 
something to do with it. Maybe it's something different, I don't know.

Will post an example for the previous TableView construction problem 
when I get around to it.

&gt;&gt;<i> * test arguments of our methods and make them compatible with null  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> values where applicable - value.NativeObject or similar constructs  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have already been causing problems for me; can't we use  Cocoa.Object 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parameters for objc_msgSend instead of IntPtr and have  them 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> translated (value == null) ? IntPtr.Zero : value.NativeObject  in a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> central place?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is true; nunit test cases would be phenominal if someone wants  
</I>&gt;<i> to start working on them.  I thought about allowing Cocoa.Objects  
</I>&gt;<i> into objc_msgSend; the reason I didn't is for EVERY objc_msgSend  
</I>&gt;<i> invocation we would need to do a type lookup on EVERY variable to  
</I>&gt;<i> determine if its a Cocoa.Object and convert it; this seems like  
</I>&gt;<i> expensive overhead to me; more expensive than (if obj == null) in the  
</I>&gt;<i> caller.  If someone wants to make a change and benchmark it showing  
</I>&gt;<i> that we wont loose a ton of cycles on this; feel free.
</I>
Will have a look a the relevant functions. I thought I already saw 
something like that somewhere in your code...

I'm not yet familiar with NUnit, only JUnit/J2MEUnit and SymbianOSUnit. 
Would be helpful to have an initial example of how it's supposed to be 
organized. :-)

&gt;&gt;<i> Then the big question: How much CLR and how much Objective-C do we  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want Cocoa# to be?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I vote as CLR as we can be.  From my &quot;polling&quot; of the &quot;apple  
</I>&gt;<i> developer community.&quot;  If they want / know / do objc; they'll keep  
</I>&gt;<i> doing their work in objc.  If they want to leverage the CLR; thats  
</I>&gt;<i> what objc# is for.  I think Cocoa# has a great fit to be the &quot;easy  
</I>&gt;<i> path to bring my (MWF|GTK#) app to the mac&quot; because it will feel  
</I>&gt;<i> familiar.  I'm open to discussions on this tho;
</I>
As you can guess I agree on this. Which is why I so strongly believe 
that the wrapper classes should have semantics like any other managed 
classes.

&gt;&gt;<i> I do like the new CLR-style event handling in Control that has made  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it into SVN and I would appreciate if we could avoid as much  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Objective-C as possible in user-derived classes or instances.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your implementation is similar to what I was planning and works like  
</I>&gt;<i> what I wanted to do (did you read my mind?) and I think its MUCH  
</I>&gt;<i> better than the target/action pair and allows for the benefit of  
</I>&gt;<i> having multiple events fire on one action.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Might it be possible to avoid needing the ExportAttribute outside  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the Cocoa# Assemblies for standard apps? I believe passing a  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> delegate to a function is an improvement over passing target and  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> selector but maybe we can improve this even further so that a  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> delegate is called with CLR semantics only and does not need to be  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exported?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Its totally possible; but we would need to register every single  
</I>&gt;<i> class/method/member of every single class in the running assembly  
</I>&gt;<i> with the objc runtime.  This seems like overkill to me.  What does  
</I>&gt;<i> everyone else think.  Should classes autoregister?  Maybe we should  
</I>&gt;<i> run a autoregistry if we find a unknown type?  Maybe we register  
</I>&gt;<i> every method in a [Register]'d class?
</I>
No, on the contrary! I don't believe *any* &quot;standard&quot; CLR class should 
register any methods with Objective-C. I was thinking more of catching 
all methods currently needing external [Export] within such &quot;proxies&quot; 
like in Control and passing them on from there. This is some more work 
for us and it implies more object instances around, but it will lead to 
Cocoa# classes complying with CLR semantics.

For instance, an XXXHandler can be pretty much anything in .NET - null, 
a Delegate or a MulticastDelegate instance - whereas in Aaron's sheet 
patch, which I repeat is an improvement and can go in, the ActionHandler 
just like in the old Control.DoubleClick is being misused as mapping a 
selector to a single method only that additionally needs to be exported 
by the caller. If instead *we* exported a method in case of non-null 
delegate arguments we could dispatch it to any CLR delegate with the 
expected semantics of &quot;if (myDelegate != null) myDelegate(...);&quot;. That's 
what Control.Action was trying to accomplish, and I am thinking about 
ways of doing this for a TableView data source too via a new abstract class.

Problem in general will be that an Objective-C protocol does not seem to 
map to a CLR interface, right? It appears to be more like a purely 
virtual class with virtual ... Method(...) = 0; in C++? I do not seem to 
need to implement _all_ methods of a certain protocol and the lack of 
some may cause some class-dependent default behavior? Wherever there are 
no such side-effects I vote for abstract or virtual CLR methods, for 
instance a protected virtual void View.OnDrawRect. Possibly additionally 
doing the same as in S.W.F, that is raising an event in the base 
implementation, e.g. View.Draw.
That way we could also tackle my contextInfo request. ;-)
