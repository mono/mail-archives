<PRE>Stefano,

&gt;<i>From a software enhancement standpoint, I really don't know how active
</I>CoocaSharp is. I've been on the mailing list for about 2.5 months and have
not see a software &quot;patch&quot; the entire time. I, personally, I been working on
a tutorial for C# WinForm Programmers trying to using CocoaSharp. Duirng
this process I have found several addition to the CocoaSharp framework that
need to be added. So....I added them to my local copy...but simply do not
have any guideance as to how to get this code in the official distribution.

I've yet to see and 'leadership' step forward. Miguel of mono swung by
breifly to nix the idea of CocoaSharp migrating to the Mono wiki....but that
about it.

This all adds up to frustration and I'm already having doubts whether I
simply will finish the tutorial I've got started, post it...and then wait
patiently for Objective-C 2.0

C#, in my opinion, is currently the 'best' compiled language to develop in.
However, Cocoa (a.k.a. OpenStep) was written in Objective-C and for
Objective-C. After taking a swang at the awkward language....I have to say
that I quickly warmed to the language....but havng to perform allocs,
deallocs, retains, and releases....quickly threw me back to the dark age of
90's (grin).

I still hold a lot of promise with CocoaSharp....I just wish whatever
leadership is on the seemingly sinking ship would crawl out from the rock
there under and give a little direction.

Todd
