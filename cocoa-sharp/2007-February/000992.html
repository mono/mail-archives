I'm sorry Urs, but I can't let you accuse me like that. I have no
issue admitting that I have been rough with you (and you only), for
a very precise reason, which I won't disclose in public unless you want
me to. And if you're basing any of this on Andy's assertion that I STFU
him, I already said that it is a lie on his part (I have the log of the
conversation).

&gt;<i> And the to say that 'the community' has to support OSX has been the
</I>&gt;<i> general response for 4+ years now, and most of the work (other then the
</I>&gt;<i> PPC port which at this point is mainly irrelevant b/c of the Intel
</I>&gt;<i> switch) has been done by none-core mono people like Geoff, Aaron,
</I>&gt;<i> Andreas, Tim, and Andy.
</I>
Do you want me to remove all my contributions to the osx port, are you
so blinded by your personal hatred? Geoff has contributed a lot, including
a good part of the x86-specific port (mainly for the simple reason that
he had access to an x86 box a couple of months before I did and he is a
great community member, hitching to get things done instead of whining),
but he consulted with me doing the port and I finished his work
(he may had ran out of time or I finally got the osx box, can't remember).
Allan did some great debugging/fixing in the GC land. I don't remember
any other significant contribution (I apologize if I forgot about it,
but the working word here is significant).
And it's pretty clear you don't have any idea of how a port of mono to
a different operating system works if you think that the ppc port
has been irrelevant: so don't go into the technical details because
it's a very weak point for you.
I don't count contributions to cocoa-sharp of course, because we have
been talking about mono here.

&gt;<i> Bugs have been files and have been sitting unattended for months and
</I>&gt;<i> years in some cases. 
</I>
We have bugs in mono that are not related to osx that are older.
Do away with your silly conspiracy theories and grow up.

&gt;<i> I think it way beyond a point were 'insulting the guy who actually did
</I>&gt;<i> port mono to OSX' makes any difference what so ever.  If at this point
</I>&gt;<i> the core Mono team does not officially support OSX there will be never
</I>&gt;<i> any commercial entity that will use Mono on that platform, and that is
</I>&gt;<i> just a fact (having been in more then one larger corporation knowing how
</I>&gt;<i> those decisions are made).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The debugger has been in its early stages for 3+ years now, so that is
</I>&gt;<i> not really a valid point either.
</I>
Don't you think we ourselves would want to have a debugger fully working?
Or a bug-free runtime and class libraries. Or a complete implementation
of everything for that matter? You're reducing everything to a non
existing anti-osx plot, when the real reason is that we have limited
resources (and that you are not willing to contribute anything).

&gt;<i> The only way this could be reconciled is by some statement and

You have a long list of &quot;I pretend, I pretend&quot;, and no mention of what
you actually want to contribute to a better mono on osx experience.
