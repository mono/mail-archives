<PRE>I won't say anything more publicly on this matter, Paolo has my  
private response, if he chooses to respond publicly, that is at his  
discretion.

I will say that I was angry when I wrote the response that contained  
the STFU, and misspoke.  What I typed that I was given a gruff STFU.   
What I intended was that I was essentially given gruff STFU. No the  
phrase STFU was not uttered.  I was however, told in no uncertain  
terms that I didn't file a bug, and because of that I shouldn't be  
whining about a bug, when in fact I wasn't whining, I was trying to  
contribute.   So be it, what I typed was not literally accurate, and  
I'm man enough to say yes I was wrong, and it was abusive of me to do  
so.  For that I apologize.

Andy
