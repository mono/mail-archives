As I said on irc, mono on OSX is/will be as relevant as its users want
it to be. Mono is an open source project: if you want anything different
you can pay a support contract. You don't want to contribute anything,
not even a simple bug report? Well, hopefully others are more
interested if you're too frustrated with your daily life to not even
file a bug report for two years.

I didn't STFU you in any way and you're a liar if you say so.
I told you to not change the config file because it would have been
incorrect and to file a bug report so the issue can be tracked.
