<PRE>Hi,
I've switched to Mac just 1 month ago, and immediately, being a Win32
software developer, I checked how to write for the Mac... and what I've
found...

Objective-C

Ok, maybe it's a nice language and all, but I find its syntax quite
&quot;confusing&quot;...

Anyway, because I've already developed some software in C# i checked the
Mono version for OsX and of course the cocoa-sharp implementation...

After some weeks of lurking this mailing list I wonder:

is Mono + Cocoa Sharp a viable solution to develop Mac OsX graphics
application or not?

I see a lot of bitterness in the words of the former contributor of the
project, so I wonder is the cocoa-sharp a still active project or just a
sinking ship?

What's the state of the implementation?
This is not clear to me...

What can WE do?

I understand how Andy feels, but maybe we can gather together and found a
way to make the project go on and be really useful, because I (and I think
many programmers) just can't afford to invest in learning and using
something that has no future...

Of course I know that everybody is working for free on the cocoa-sharp
project and I really appreciate their work, but I think we all have to
really understand where this project is going...

Thank you

Stefano
