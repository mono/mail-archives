<PRE>With Todd's help, I've been able to download and compile the 0.9.4  
sources which seem to be the latest.  However, the level of activity  
seems to be low.  When I look at the various source files (e.g.  
ProgressIndicator.cs, Strings.cs, etc) it became apparent that very  
few of the needed methods and properties have been implemented.  I  
don't say that as a criticism: from the look of this 'glue' code,  
writing this code would be very tedious and error-prone.

This got me thinking: might it be possible to come up with some  
automated method for generating a lot of this glue?  If a utility  
such as class-dump can pick apart the interface of a Cocoa framework,  
then might it be possible to pipe the output from class-dump into  
some other tool that could then generate much of the glue?  Ok, I  
realise I'm being a bit simplistic here: you'd need to tell the tool  
to (for example) pair up setWidgetSize: and widgetSize into a single  
property at the C# level, but does anyone think this might be feasible?

&gt;<i> Yikes! Boy if you are correct then I may have volunteered for more  
</I>&gt;<i> that I
</I>&gt;<i> had bargained for....doh. I guess I'll wait a few more days to see  
</I>&gt;<i> if I get
</I>&gt;<i> any other replys about the leadership team. Being new to this whole  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;open
</I>&gt;<i> source&quot; development community stuff, I don't know what is typical  
</I>&gt;<i> or not. I
</I>&gt;<i> aid in the development of airborne software and I'm used to process,
</I>&gt;<i> process, process...and deadlines, deadlines, deadlines....
