Well, I'm good with this, but I think we really want to hear Geoff's opinion
before any decisions are made.

As for the website,  I think we can make something work for what you want
and need.  Manuel, if you have some ideas on the look and feel shoot we can
round table it.  I'm generally on IRC during the day (GMT -5) and can
generally arrange to be online at any time if you want to hash some of this
out.

The current CocoaSharp content and site has been slowly being redone, as the
existing Wiki has really gotten outdated fast, so at this point, I'd say,
start getting your ideas together and we'll move forward.

proper letters on the keyboard to produce:

&gt;<i> Hi Andrew,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have to say that I agree with you, I don't really care if we are going to
</I>&gt;<i> use or not the Novell resources, but if we do so we have to be careful and
</I>&gt;<i> make sure that the project does not get diluted in the mono project.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe that we should try and make a difference between the mono for Mac
</I>&gt;<i> OS X development and what we want to achieve.. It is clear that both
</I>&gt;<i> projects are very tight together and that if we do our work correctly they
</I>&gt;<i> could even merge, but this should not be neither a goal or an initial idea.
</I>&gt;<i> I think that we should have some kind of manifesto that states what the
</I>&gt;<i> project wants to achieve and how, in other word a nice text explaining or
</I>&gt;<i> goals clearly and that can be understand by anyone no matter their
</I>&gt;<i> background.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Deciding which people (from my point of view the most experienced ones from
</I>&gt;<i> the last attempt/team) are going to direct the team should be our priority
</I>&gt;<i> right now. That way we could start organizing resources and performing some
</I>&gt;<i> design decisions. We cannot do anything until we get the new bindings for
</I>&gt;<i> object v2 besides getting the team up.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Manuel (2 am at Spain.... going to bed, the dodgy tv adverts have already
</I>&gt;<i> started!!!!)

</I>&gt;<i> Now that I'm back in the office and not painting / limited access.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I/Druware owns the CocoaSharp.org domain and website.  We have, IMO, two
</I>&gt;<i> options.  Merge everything into the Mono Project, or keep everything under
</I>&gt;<i> the CocoaSharp domain (or possibly both which is probably the Best of Both
</I>&gt;<i> worlds, but I don't know that we have the resources).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is good and bad to both.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With the Mono Project option, we run the risk of being 'lost in the shuffle'
</I>&gt;<i> as it were, with the nominally Linux centered world of Mono, many of the Mac
</I>&gt;<i> specific details could get left by the wayside.  The other issue is that
</I>&gt;<i> cocoasharp really goes beyond the scope of 'mono', so it begs the question
</I>&gt;<i> of if it fits.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With the CocoaSharp.org, you get a site that is something we can control
</I>&gt;<i> without impact from the Mono Team, but it comes with none of theease that
</I>&gt;<i> using Novell's web infrastructure brings, but also gives us the power to
</I>&gt;<i> create whatever we want (it is running on a shared host / Windows / ASP.NET
</I>&gt;<i> hosting), and though it has a wiki today, the underlying code is AWFUL, so
</I>&gt;<i> if that's the route we want to go, I'd like to move to something a little
</I>&gt;<i> better :-). 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Times have changed a bunch since I put up the original Cocoa Sharp site, the
</I>&gt;<i> people have changed, and the Mac has become a full peer in the Mono
</I>&gt;<i> community, with a person on staff at Novell working on it, so for people
</I>&gt;<i> like me that had become pretty frustrated with the lack of progress and/or
</I>&gt;<i> struggles to keep Mono and the Mac on working terms are returning to the
</I>&gt;<i> fold.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm good with either choice, and I'll look to the community to point a
</I>&gt;<i> direction, but we do need to consolidate the efforts in a single direction.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the interest of consolidating communication for the Cocoa# project, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have shut down the cocoa-sharp-dev Google group. I posted a message
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> directing devs to the Mono cocoa# mailing list.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Are we using the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mono wiki or somewhere else? Once that is determined, I will copy over the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Google wiki pages and post them on the official Cocoa# wiki page and close
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> down the Google wiki I had set up. Note that much of the content on the
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Google wiki was simply copied from the old cocoasharp.org wiki.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, there is the CSharpXcodeplugin. Are people still interested in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> developing this? If so I can move it back to the Mono SVN (there is an old
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> version of the code already in there).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Dave
