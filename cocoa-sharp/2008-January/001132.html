For what it's worth... I think that CocoaSharp should have its own
site, specifically because I expect many users who are familiar with
.NET but not Cocoa or the Mac OS. I do not think that the people who
are looking for information on Cocoa# are the same people who are
looking for general information about Mono.

At the same time the connection to Mono should be made really obvious,
with Mono logos and links and everything. Nobody likes a small
project.

&gt;<i> There is good and bad to both.

</I>
I think the focus should be on Mac users and present Mono and
CocoaSharp as complimentary projects.

It is probably easier to convince Mac users/developers to use .NET and
CocoaSharp than it is to convince .NET (or Windows) developers to use
CocoaSharp and port to a platform they probably think should be
covered by Winforms.

Does that make sense?

Mono and CocoaSharp should be seen as one from Windows and as two from Mac OS.

&gt;<i> With the CocoaSharp.org, you get a site that is something we can control
</I>&gt;<i> without impact from the Mono Team, but it comes with none of theease that
</I>&gt;<i> using Novell's web infrastructure brings, but also gives us the power to

</I>&gt;<i> if that's the route we want to go, I'd like to move to something a little
</I>&gt;<i> better :-).
</I>
You might want to talk to Manuel de la Pena about the site. He was
really interested in the idea of reworking it.

I myself am planning to write a lot of tutorials with lots of
screenshots, covering installation and use of everything involved. So
if there is a site, I would love to upload lots of material!

&gt;<i> I'm good with either choice, and I'll look to the community to point a
</I>&gt;<i> direction, but we do need to consolidate the efforts in a single direction.
</I>
Ok, here is, in short, what I think should be done:

1. There should be a Mono-independent site for CocoaSharp, i.e.
www.cocoasharp.org.

2. Talk to Manuel de la Pena about specifics for the site.

3. Talk to Novell and put obvious Mono logos and links on the site.

4. Give me a way to submit documentation.


Regards,
Andrew.
