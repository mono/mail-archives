You will have a hard time trying to convince Mac developers to use a  
memory-hogging wrapper around the Objective-C API they'd normally use,  
especially since they now have GC support themselves.

If that's what you'd like to do, then you need a brilliant idea how to  
both avoid managed wrappers pointing to dealloc'ed/GC'ed ObjC  
instances and to avoid our (reference-incremented?) objects to be kept  
from releasing by our own GC due to mapping of pointers and objects.

Unless such a solution is found, Cocoa# will rather be a technology  
for those familiar with .NET/Mono and interested in a native GUI on  
the Mac without having to learn Objective-C.
(the problem being that while Cocoa# is incomplete, some Objective-C  
knowledge is required to fill in the missing parts)
