&gt;<i> For the goal of consolidation maybe this will help. Here is a  
</I>&gt;<i> summary of
</I>&gt;<i> all the resources that Cocoa# is directly and indirectly using:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Projects*
</I>&gt;<i> CocoaSharp
</I>&gt;<i> CSharp Plugin for Xcode
</I>&gt;<i> Mono on OSX
</I>
Some more related projects are:

cocoa-sharq (my rewrite forked in 2006)
objc-sharp (another similar project by Geoff at Mono)
Dumbarton (contributed by imeem to Mono)

</I>&gt;<i> Thoughts?

Some consolidation of the various resources would indeed be good.

I'd assume there is no -dev and no-dev split between the mailing lists  
(and I agree that wouldn't make sense), cocoa-sharp-dev is simply the  
name of the Google project. It would make sense to decide upon which  
to use for Cocoa# development and to document that.
But please don't merge Cocoa# *code review* into Mono-osx.

The problem is who moved to Google and who didn't. I don't see  
Kangaroo, Dru, Urs on your group, neither am I or some others that  
contributed at some earlier point. So factually cocoa-sharp-dev is  
another fork even though the code itself still appears to be in Mono's  
trunk.

I believe to really make Cocoa a first-class Mono citizen, a separate  
project, like Google Code, would be a better place for now as it'll be  
easier for people to sign up and get SVN access and update pages, and  
to stay ahead of Mono's release cycle. Compare Geoff's new SWF project  
where he has to provide updates and bugfixes for the released Mono  
version through his personal blog that only few people know about.

If there's renewed interest in actively working on the ObjC bridge I'd  
gladly join the effort over at Google. That code hasn't been touched  
since early 2006 when Geoff picked up parts of my improvements.

For my C# plugin however I'd rather not host that at any Cocoa#  
project. C# syntax coloring is one thing, integration of the various  
compilers another and templates for specific projects or file types  
yet another.
