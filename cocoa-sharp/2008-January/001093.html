I'm still at the stage that I don't see anything of what I've written  
in Xcode, no new menu item.

I am not aware of any documentation other than Damien's, and that was  
not even up-to-date for 2.3. Moreover I see his headers for native  
ObjC code as problematic (they are GPL, thus any code derived from it  
becomes GPL while Xcode is not GPL; depending on interpretations, this  
can be regarded as violation) and instead had a BSD-ish plugin based  
on Cocoa-sharq; the accompanying spec files were integrated with  
bridged ObjC code, and ObjC is the part we can pretty much dump first  
when a new version is out... I used a managed framework to inspect the  
available classes, their methods and then probed all interesting  
parameters, and in the end some trial-and-error. I'd like to avoid  
that work for now!

So currently I am trying to deploy my draft spec files to /Developer/ 
Library/Xcode/Specifications but I'm not sure if they are even being  
picked up there, there are only xctxtmacro files and an xcplugin  
there. (it would've been handy)

There are some files in /Developer/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ 
DevToolsCore.framework/Resources that look the same as in Xcode 2.4  
(pb*spec). XcodeEdit.Framework has differing &quot;xclangspec&quot; files.  
ASKPlugin uses an xcspec file containing an old-style language  
definition (referring to a custom native scanner).
Looking at the existing local Xcode files is the closest thing to  
&quot;documentation&quot; I currently have.

Regards,

Andreas
