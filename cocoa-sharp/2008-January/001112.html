Hm... wouldn't CocoaSharp users be developers who develop applications
based on CocoaSharp while CocoaSharp developers are developers who
work on CocoaSharp itself?

I see your point, but I don't know why they made the distinction.
Perhaps that is why.

&gt;<i> On the google one a couple of us have been talking about how to write

</I>
That is true. I find everything very confusing.

I have some stuff for the site, once it gets started.

&gt;<i> I know that there is people that want to help the group and work a lot
</I>&gt;<i> but we first have to fix all the problems we have and centralize all
</I>&gt;<i> the info of the project. We have potential coders with the skills but
</I>&gt;<i> when they see this situation they get scared.
</I>
Can we figure out or make a list of who we are and who can do what? I
am working on beginner's how-to docs, for what it's worth. I can't
contribute to CocoaSharp itself (I gave two reasons to some readers
here), but I want to use CocoaSharp and do what I can do to help.

I have testing experience, am familiar with Visual Studio and Xcode,
and use Macs at home and Windows at work, hence feel at home with
CocoaSharp.

BTW, I'm in Dublin, Ireland.

&gt;<i> We need to discuss a solution... please replay to both mailing lists
</I>&gt;<i> so everyone reads it until we decide which one to use.
</I>
I suggest the Google group, it's easier to access on the road. I check
the groups from work.
