<PRE>Hi everybody,

I am new to that mailing list, Mac and Mono (fortunately not in .NET). So I 
would have some questions about the things you are working one right now.

1- I would like to know the current state of Cocoa# and the things I can and 
can't do with it. What I would like to know is if it would be possible to 
create a totally skinnable user interface using Cocoa# (something like Winamp).

2- I am also considering creating the interface of my application using GTK#. 
Unfortunately, the link &quot;<A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/adhamh/gtksharp.tgz&quot;">http://homepage.mac.com/adhamh/gtksharp.tgz&quot;</A> doesn't 
works anymore. Anyone could send this file to me by email please?

3- I think that I would be able to create such a skinnable user interface 
using GTK#, am I right? If so, is GTK# slow on OSX? (Considering that he uses 
X11)?


Thanks you very much for all these answers,


Salutations,


Fr&#233;d&#233;rick Giasson
