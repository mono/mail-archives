</I>&gt;<i> :-) Any ideas? Can I force the strings to be interpreted as UTF-8 by

</I>&gt;<i> somehow?
</I>
First off; I'm not sure that we publish nightly tarballs?  At least I 
never knew we did.

Anyways we do hide NSStrings as strings; but this shouldn't matter.  
Can you make a testcase and file a bug and I'll move it to mono if 
appropriate?
