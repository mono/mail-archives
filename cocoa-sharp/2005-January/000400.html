<PRE>Hey,

In this Cocoa# application that I'm developing, I'm reading an XML file
(originally created with System.Xml.Serialization's XmlSerializer) using
XmlDocument. The XML file specifies encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;. When I pass these C#
strings to a DataSource connected to a NSOutlineView, however, the UTF-8
characters in some of the entries are not displayed properly. It looks like
they're being displayed as if the encoding were not being taken into
consideration. I think there were some recent changes to Cocoa# to make C#
strings and NSStrings transparently interchangeable? Note that my version of
Cocoa# is a nightly tarball from about 10 days ago... Anyway, I was wondering
if this is a Mono bug with System.Xml, a Cocoa# bug with string encodings, or
if I'm just doing something wrong. The latter wouldn't surprise me at all.
:<i>-) Any ideas? Can I force the strings to be interpreted as UTF-8 by Cocoa
</I>somehow?

Thanks,
Ed
