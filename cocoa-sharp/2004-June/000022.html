<PRE>Yes you are missing something.

A selector is just an integer representation of a string nothing more
nothing less, and there is already a function in NSString.cs that creates a
SEL from a string.

A SEL cannot be compared to a function pointer; it's just the name of the
message to be sent.

Any message that is dispatched goes through objc_send method which
dynamically invokes the given method on the given base, look @ it as SEL
being a 'string index' into the 'v-table' of the base; just that it is done
dynamically and not static like C++ or C#, since Objective-C like Smalltalk
allows to create Classes and add methods to new and existing classes @
runtime.

Java for instance is deeply integrated which Objective-C since there is a
special meta-class for java in cocoa, just look @ some base headers and you
will see what I mean.

The capability to extend an existing NS class or add a new NS class to the
system in a different language is the sole purpose of objc#.  Yes it is not
complete but it shows how it can be done.  Of course you can re-implement
that in cocoa#, but I think that defeats the point.

Subject: [Cocoa-sharp] Selector musings

I think I'm missing something here, but I've been carrying on with 
selector musings.

It looks like everything that derives from NSObject implements 
performSelector:SEL.

Could we not generate a class (NSSelector.cs) that would take a string 
and compile it to a SEL.  Pass that Selector into (for instance) a 
NSButton.setAction(), along with the class to act on casted to 
NSObject; like so:

NSButton.setAction((NSObject)button2, mySelector);

which would call glue which was:

void performSelector(NSObject* toActOn, SEL theSelector) {
   [toActOn performSelector:theSelector];
}

so in this example we could have:

mySelector = new NSSelector(&quot;setTitle: @&quot;foo&quot;&quot;);

pass that and button2 to button1, when clicked it should call glue and 
perform action; no?

Am I missing something obvious?

As for the NSSelector constructor; I'm sure we could clean it up using 
properties and such from the objects themselves.
