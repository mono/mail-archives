<PRE>Urs has brought up to me recently the issues around Cocoa's  
target-action model, and how we can get around it.  Not wanting to  
carry on a StopEnergy campaign I did some reasearch today around this.   
Urs was suggesting using ObjCSharp to get around this issue, which  
would work perfectly.  However, I decided to look at how apple got  
around this in the java world.  Specifically, Cocoa implements a  
NSSelector class.  See:

LanguageIntegration/index.html

We could probably use something very similar to this.
