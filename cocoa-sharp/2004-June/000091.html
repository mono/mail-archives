<PRE>&gt;<i> -----Original Message-----
</I>&gt;<i> From: Miguel de Icaza [mailto:<A HREF="mailto:miguel@novell.com">miguel@novell.com</A>]
</I>&gt;<i> Sent: Tuesday, June 15, 2004 8:44 PM
</I>&gt;<i> To: Urs Muff
</I>&gt;<i> Cc: Cocoa#
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: RE: [Cocoa-sharp] Binding thoughts.

</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	* Use .NET casing for public identifiers, to follow
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	  the .NET coding API guidelines.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [Urs] I don't know about that I would probably tend more towards strict
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; equivalence to the underlying API to reduce confusion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, my issue is that from C# you will be able to use and consuming
</I>&gt;<i> plenty of third party components (Tao, OpenGL, IIOP.NET, Remoting
</I>&gt;<i> channels, WSE, Chart software, Protocols, Ogg#, GUI layout classes,
</I>&gt;<i> System.Drawing) and god knows how much more.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And it will be inconsistent in the C# world to have everything
</I>&gt;<i> consistent, except the GUI.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So yes, it would be a change from Obj-C programmers going into C#, but
</I>&gt;<i> those are a minority compared to the Windows developer crowds that would
</I>&gt;<i> get exposed to the Mac (the same argument and reasons we have in Linux
</I>&gt;<i> to change our conventions as well apply here).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Notice that the C++ binding for Gtk+ uses very Gtk-esque bindings on
</I>&gt;<i> Linux, to keep the similarity.  We have also departed from that, because
</I>&gt;<i> we felt that the Windows-&gt;Linux consistency was more important.
</I>
I don't care too much about this one, as long as it can be automated since
we will generated them from the original headers.  Writing Cocoa apps will
require a lot of Cocoa specific knowledge and even some knowledge about
Objective-C messaging runtime behavior to understand how things fit
together, Objective-C is not strictly typed and otherwise does not fix
perfectly into the .Net universe.  Having different naming schemes will be
the least of evils in my opinion, and having the method names not match up
the Cocoa documentation will not help understand that complex framework.
But hey what do I know, I just wrote a two way bridge for that.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	* The NS prefix is kind of redundant on C#, since you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	  got namespaces: the C-like namespace avoidance can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	  be eliminated this way.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [Urs] Absolutely positively NO: NSString, NSObject, NSArray or not
</I>&gt;<i> String,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Object or Array and should never be confused with that, that is also
</I>&gt;<i> valid
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for all the other types like NSApplication.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You are confused.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> System.Object != NS.Object
</I>&gt;<i> System.Array != NS.Array
</I>&gt;<i> System.String != NS.String
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We also have `Gtk.Object' and `GLib.Object' in Gtk# as an example.
</I>
Please don't offend me!  You of all should know me better!  Of course I know
that, but I still don't like that since System is normally in the 'using'
space and there for you would have to prefix the NS* object even if you are
in the given namespace, and that just makes it cumbersome and very ugly
especially since those will be in the namespace Apple.Foundation!

Urs.
