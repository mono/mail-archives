&lt;excerpt&gt;To begin with, I think that NSString should be hidden, there
is no point

in the user knowing anything about NSStrings, NSObjects and NSArrays.

They are part of a different universe.


&lt;/excerpt&gt;

Agreed partially;  If you look at our latest API changes we've already
started going down this road.. (ie; mybutton.Title = &quot;foo&quot; rather than
mybutton.setTitle(new NSString(&quot;foo&quot;));  however they shouldn't be
_fully_ hidden; they still need to be accessible in subclassing
instances (ie; I want to subclass NSObject/NSWindow/NSfoo)


&lt;excerpt&gt;Lets go back to my example with Gtk+: Gtk has a GString type,
and a

GArray type, and a GList type.


And we worked very hard to remove every one of those from the public

API, as they overlap with the first-class citizens of the .NET world.  I

think the benefit is big.


&lt;/excerpt&gt;	Again see above;


&lt;excerpt&gt;My job is just to pass this information to you guys, maybe
its useful to

you, maybe its not.


&lt;/excerpt&gt;	It is useful; the more input at this stage can help direct
the development to be the most suitable to both worlds..


&lt;excerpt&gt;If you find this discussion useful, we can continue it, but
at this

point with the differing opinions I do not think I can be of any
further

help.


&lt;/excerpt&gt;

	Please see above; input is never a harmful thing; however that being
said I'm certain there are some decisions that we will make that will
piss off the Apple world; and some decisions we will make that will
piss off the .Net world.  We (this is my personal opinion not
consulting the rest of the &quot;group&quot;) need to walk a fine line and
appease as many people as possible; and at the same time be prepared
to fully explain why certain concessions were made both ways.
