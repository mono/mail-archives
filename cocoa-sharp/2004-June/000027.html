Does that mean we go with jkh's installer in /opt instead of
/Library/Framework that is up there now provided by kangaroo and the other
Mac OS X hackers?  That would be against what the core Mac OS X hackers do.

Subject: [Mono-hackers-list] Roadmap to 1.0 (the next 2 weeks)

Hello,

Important, please read all.

All mention of time here will be based on Boston time.

Here's the projection for the next 2 weeks:

            June 9 2004
        Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
               1  2  3  4  5
         6  7  8 *9 10 11 12    Beta 3      on the 11th
        13 14 15 16 17 18 19    RC 1        on the 18th
        20 21 22 23 24 25 26    1.0 freeze  on the 25th
        27 28 29 30		1.0 release on the 30th	
        
The plan is to release beta-3 on Friday the 11th, with tarballs prepared
that morning by Miguel. I'll make RPMs available by Friday night, or
Saturday at the latest.

We'll repeat the same procedure for RC1 and the 1.0 freeze.

Here are the goals for Beta 3 are:

*** If you have anything to add to this list, please reply promptly. 
*** Issues will be dropped if they don't end up on this list.

* Full library signing. 
        I think we're done. Sebastien, can you confirm that?

* GC bugs affecting iFolder. 
        Miguel told me that everything has been resolved from our end.
        We need to give the iFolder team a tarball to test before
        releasing beta-3. We'll delay this release if there are still
        problems with iFolder.
        
* Ship IBM.DB2. 
        We screwed up and haven't been shipping it since the beta cycle.
        This will need to be fixed.

* Bug #59688. 
        Gonzalo's has an ongoing bug with the HTTP stuff
        (<A HREF="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=59688">http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=59688</A>) We need to
        know how bad it is, how long it'll take to fix it, and what the
        implications are if we leave it alone.
        
* New gacutil. 
        Jackson is working on the new frontend to gacutil. Before we
        ship beta-3, we need to make sure that all Makefiles in the mcs
        module, in Gtk# and in iFolder work as expected.

* Turn off signalstack.
        We'll be turning off the signalstack in the Mono runtime by
        default. I did this already, and the next build will include
        this change.

* Bootstrap twice
        This is a reminder for Miguel to bootstrap twice when preparing
        for tarballs, this fixes the ZipLib referencing issues we see
        from beta1-&gt;beta2.

* IKVM testing
        We need to test IKVM before releasing. This is a task for Duncan
        and Erik.

* PPC testing and packaging
        We need to send jkh at Apple a tarball of the current CVS tree
        and make sure that it works and that he can build us an
        installer.

* Adding license sections to all source files.
        We need to make sure an MIT license gets added to each source
        file before we ship 1.0. I'll post a seperate post to the list
        about this.
        
Duncan.
