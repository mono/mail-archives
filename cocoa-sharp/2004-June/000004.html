1&amp;2:

   I build a new binary package for b2 which miguel has in &quot;testing&quot;

<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/beta2/macos/Mono_0.95_Beta_2.dmg">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/beta2/macos/Mono_0.95_Beta_2.dmg</A>

It installs a more customized version of a psuedo-framework (headers in 
Headers, binaries in Commands, etc) and adds all the bins as symlinks 
to /usr/bin.

&gt;<i> (3) Binary Installer for the Xcode plugin's to make it recognize C# 
</I>&gt;<i> code for
</I>&gt;<i> integration into Cocoa applications.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
We should dmg and pkg this as well; I agree.

&gt;<i> (4) Polish and Prep for public consumption the Cocoa calling to Mono 
</I>&gt;<i> effort
</I>&gt;<i> and build a binary installation of the tools.  This means Xcode 
</I>&gt;<i> templates
</I>&gt;<i> and project files.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think we have a small enough team to be nimble right now, without 
being encumbered by doing a call for devs yet.  Perhaps thats just my 
opinion.  I'd prefer keeping the team smaller and getting things closer 
to a usable state as a developer before opening it up to hackers.  Why? 
  Doing a call for effort will bring hackers, but it will also bring 
&quot;why doesn't bla do foo yet&quot; people (see mono-list for a fantastic 
example).  I think we can concentrate on a good core feature set for 
now with the people already involved.  Feel free to disagree;

&gt;<i> (5) Package XSP Installation (Mod_mono pending Apache 1.3 integration)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
We need mod_mono to be apache 1.3 happy for this; but I dont think 
anything else on the list should be contingent upon this (ie 6-&gt;n).

&gt;<i> Here is where there is a fork in the road, and I think we need a 
</I>&gt;<i> strategic
</I>&gt;<i> division of labor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On one path we need the Cocoa# Bindings and glue code effort, while on 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> other we need to get GTK# and MonoDevelop packaged.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (6) Package GTK# Installation
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is do-able today; however; for a binary pkg of this I think we 
want to avoid fink and have a custom gnome install into our 
&quot;framework&quot;.  I've already done this locally and gotten around all the 
weird gnome build issues; I just need to update for beta2/1.0

&gt;<i> (7) Package MonoDevelop Installation
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
See 6 above.

&gt;<i> -or-
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is my preference for now, to concentrate on Cocoa# not gtk#.  To 
be honest with gtk#; If we're going to go down that road; I'd rather 
work on a native port of gtk+ to OSX to get gtk# working than keeping 
all the X11 stuff.

&gt;<i> (6) Generate Glue &amp; Library
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (7) Implement NSSelector
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (8) Package Phase I of the Mono to Cocoa implementation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
6 shouldn't be too difficult.  Look at urs's introspector in objc-sharp 
for an example of objc &quot;reflection&quot;.  7 appears doable implementing 
something like the java implementation that I posted above.  The other 
&quot;feature&quot; of going this route is we can pilfer some documentation. :)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Somewhere in there, we also need to get the Mono Debugger working and
</I>&gt;<i> integrated, or no developer is going to buy into it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I agree 100%.  If I'm not mistaken the debugger is currently limited by 
the lack of NPTL?

The other issue we need to discuss and bring some mono people into the 
loop on is the threading issue in the mono runtime.  urs &amp; I had a 
brief chat with miguel/lupus about this; and they done seem _totally_ 
adverse to making some changes to mono to support running at thread 0, 
but also indicated it would probably also be a post 1.0 implmentation.  
If we're going to keep using the Loader I hacked together; I should 
probably make it so that people can whip up a quick autogen to package 
the generated app as a MacOs.app which the loader calls the runtime to 
load the assembly.

&gt;<i> These are all high level bullet items, and we need to break them down

</I>&gt;<i> much more granular, but in my view, this is what we need to roadmap
