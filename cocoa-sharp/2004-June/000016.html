<PRE>Okay, here's an updated roadmap.  Tired to incorporate feedback.  We 
still need to flush this out more.  I'd like to see it in a form that 
we can all take discrete parts to work on.  Also, I have tired to think 
about the order we should do things in, but the order isn't final.

Here are some things I'm unclear on:

	Is Urs' bridge fully functional?
	What improvement does it need?
	What steps do we want to implement the Cocoa# bridge in?
	What is going to be required to get the Mono debugger running on OS X?


RoadMap for the MonoObjC bridge

The MonoObjC is a two way bridge that will allow Mono API's to be 
accessed from Objective-C and vice versus.  It is modeled on the PyObjC 
bridge.

	Objective-C# is the Objective-C -&gt; Mono portion of the bridge
	(Should we call this MonoCocoa instead?)

	Cocoa# is the Mono -&gt; Cocoa portion of the bridge.

I.  	Create a Mono.framework that encapsulates the mono runtime in the 
same way that the JavaVM.framework encapsulates the Java runtime in OS 
X.
	This will be the basis of the MonoObjC and will contain the actual 
bridge as well.

II.	Create Xcode compiler plugin and pbfilespec and pblangspec files to 
allow Xcode to use mcs and recognize C# files.

III.  	Create a native installer for the Mono.framework  and pieces 
from part II that is package based and contained in a disk image.

IV.	Test and integrate the mod_mono Apache 1.3 module.  When ready 
integrate into the package.

V.	Implement Objective-C# bridge so that it is useful for basic 
application development.
		
		Some goals:
		1. The ability to build and test ASP.NET Web Services
		2. The ability to consume ASP.NET Web Services from C#
		3. The ability to consume ASP.NET Web Services from Cocoa
		4. The ability to call Mono assemblies from Cocoa
		5. The ability to call Cocoa API facilities from Mono

VI.	Implement Cocoa# bridge so that it is useful for basic application 
development.

		Some goals:
		1. The ability to call Cocoa API facilities from Mono
	
V.	Achieve basic functionality of Mono Debugger on OS X.  Goal is full 
functionality as threading implementation allows.

VI.	Work with core mono team to implement mono running as thread 0.  In 
meantime implement the cleanest possible loader to allow Cocoa#
	applications to function.
