</I>
Does this (or is this) going to contain the ObjC# and cocoa# frameworks 
too?  I think it should as it will give one stop shopping...

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (3) Binary Installer for the Xcode plugin's to make it recognize C#

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> integration into Cocoa applications.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> We should dmg and pkg this as well; I agree.
</I>
BLAH!  For now, we have completely hacked support for C# code 
recognition in Xcode.  I don't know if we want to discriminate that, 
but then again we might not have a choice because of Xcode bugs...

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (4) Polish and Prep for public consumption the Cocoa calling to Mono 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> effort
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and build a binary installation of the tools.  This means Xcode 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> templates
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and project files.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we have a small enough team to be nimble right now, without 
</I>&gt;<i> being encumbered by doing a call for devs yet.  Perhaps thats just my 
</I>&gt;<i> opinion.  I'd prefer keeping the team smaller and getting things 
</I>&gt;<i> closer to a usable state as a developer before opening it up to

</I>&gt;<i> will also bring &quot;why doesn't bla do foo yet&quot; people (see mono-list for 
</I>&gt;<i> a fantastic example).  I think we can concentrate on a good core 
</I>&gt;<i> feature set for now with the people already involved.  Feel free to 
</I>&gt;<i> disagree;
</I>
I totally agree.  This also lets us make decisions.  While they may not 
be &quot;right&quot; too many chefs spoils the soup.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (5) Package XSP Installation (Mod_mono pending Apache 1.3 integration)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We need mod_mono to be apache 1.3 happy for this; but I dont think 
</I>&gt;<i> anything else on the list should be contingent upon this (ie 6-&gt;n).
</I>
Who is working on this?  How is their progress?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here is where there is a fork in the road, and I think we need a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> strategic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> division of labor.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On one path we need the Cocoa# Bindings and glue code effort, while 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other we need to get GTK# and MonoDevelop packaged.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (6) Package GTK# Installation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is do-able today; however; for a binary pkg of this I think we 
</I>&gt;<i> want to avoid fink and have a custom gnome install into our 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;framework&quot;.  I've already done this locally and gotten around all the 
</I>&gt;<i> weird gnome build issues; I just need to update for beta2/1.0
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (7) Package MonoDevelop Installation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> See 6 above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -or-
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is my preference for now, to concentrate on Cocoa# not gtk#.  To 
</I>&gt;<i> be honest with gtk#; If we're going to go down that road; I'd rather 
</I>&gt;<i> work on a native port of gtk+ to OSX to get gtk# working than keeping 
</I>&gt;<i> all the X11 stuff.
</I>
I think any GTK stuff should be later.  Cocoa#/ObjC# should be first.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (6) Generate Glue &amp; Library
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (7) Implement NSSelector
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (8) Package Phase I of the Mono to Cocoa implementation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 6 shouldn't be too difficult.  Look at urs's introspector in 
</I>&gt;<i> objc-sharp for an example of objc &quot;reflection&quot;.  7 appears doable 
</I>&gt;<i> implementing something like the java implementation that I posted 
</I>&gt;<i> above.  The other &quot;feature&quot; of going this route is we can pilfer some 
</I>&gt;<i> documentation. :)
</I>
Documentation?!?!  HA  I look around and see what I can find though.  I 
might not be able to share it.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Somewhere in there, we also need to get the Mono Debugger working and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> integrated, or no developer is going to buy into it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree 100%.  If I'm not mistaken the debugger is currently limited 
</I>&gt;<i> by the lack of NPTL?
</I>
Ugh, I hope not...  OS X has some posix threads, but porting that 
library might not be fun.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The other issue we need to discuss and bring some mono people into the 
</I>&gt;<i> loop on is the threading issue in the mono runtime.  urs &amp; I had a 
</I>&gt;<i> brief chat with miguel/lupus about this; and they done seem _totally_ 
</I>&gt;<i> adverse to making some changes to mono to support running at thread 0, 
</I>&gt;<i> but also indicated it would probably also be a post 1.0 implmentation. 
</I>&gt;<i>  If we're going to keep using the Loader I hacked together; I should 
</I>&gt;<i> probably make it so that people can whip up a quick autogen to package 
</I>&gt;<i> the generated app as a MacOs.app which the loader calls the runtime to 
</I>&gt;<i> load the assembly.
</I>
Yeah, lets not forget that while mono maybe closing in on 1.0, we 
aren't really past .01 yet.  I think the hacked loader will be good for 
now.  We just need to keep docs together so that people know what we 
are doing.
