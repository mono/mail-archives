<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> I think we need to get our own list together of stuff we need to do by 
</I>&gt;<i> the Mono 1.0 release.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe its time we get our own project so we can track our bugs?  Its 
</I>&gt;<i> there a place like novell forge or source forge where we can get a 
</I>&gt;<i> project, but restrict its access?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If all we can do by Mono 1.0 is to get a fully functional 
</I>&gt;<i> /Library/Framework/Mono.framework install going then that's fine, hell 
</I>&gt;<i> that's great!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (I seem to remember in IRC that stated there were problem with this 
</I>&gt;<i> still, but since we don't have an official tracking system, I can't be 
</I>&gt;<i> sure.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm just starting to feel a little like we aren't as cohesive in our 
</I>&gt;<i> efforts as we could be.
</I>
Mono 1.0 is too close for you guys to get something completely done in
time.  Do not worry, we will follow up with Mono 1.2, 1.4 and 2.0 to
keep everyone busy.  So I would not be too worried in not catching the
&quot;1.0&quot; train. 

You guys have done a tremendous amount of progress in record time, am
surprised!   

If you need Bugzilla, we can open a bugzilla for you (or you can use
forge, whatever is more comfortable).

If I do not responde, catch me on irc, or CC me, I do not read the
mailing lists every day.

Miguel.
