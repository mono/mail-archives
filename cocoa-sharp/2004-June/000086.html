<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> 	* Use .NET casing for public identifiers, to follow
</I>&gt;<i> 	  the .NET coding API guidelines.
</I>&gt;<i> [Urs] I don't know about that I would probably tend more towards strict
</I>&gt;<i> equivalence to the underlying API to reduce confusion.
</I>
Well, my issue is that from C# you will be able to use and consuming
plenty of third party components (Tao, OpenGL, IIOP.NET, Remoting
channels, WSE, Chart software, Protocols, Ogg#, GUI layout classes,
System.Drawing) and god knows how much more.

And it will be inconsistent in the C# world to have everything
consistent, except the GUI.

So yes, it would be a change from Obj-C programmers going into C#, but
those are a minority compared to the Windows developer crowds that would
get exposed to the Mac (the same argument and reasons we have in Linux
to change our conventions as well apply here).

Notice that the C++ binding for Gtk+ uses very Gtk-esque bindings on
Linux, to keep the similarity.  We have also departed from that, because
we felt that the Windows-&gt;Linux consistency was more important. 

&gt;<i> 	* The NS prefix is kind of redundant on C#, since you
</I>&gt;<i> 	  got namespaces: the C-like namespace avoidance can
</I>&gt;<i> 	  be eliminated this way.
</I>&gt;<i> [Urs] Absolutely positively NO: NSString, NSObject, NSArray or not String,
</I>&gt;<i> Object or Array and should never be confused with that, that is also valid
</I>&gt;<i> for all the other types like NSApplication.
</I>
You are confused.  

System.Object != NS.Object
System.Array != NS.Array
System.String != NS.String

We also have `Gtk.Object' and `GLib.Object' in Gtk# as an example.

Miguel
