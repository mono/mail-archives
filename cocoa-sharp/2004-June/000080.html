Subject: [Cocoa-sharp] Binding thoughts.

Hey guys,

    What are the plans to Dot-net-ify the cocoa binding?

    I see a few areas where it could be made more Dotnetish:

	* convert get/set into properties.
[Urs] I totally agree with that.

	* Use .NET casing for public identifiers, to follow
	  the .NET coding API guidelines.
[Urs] I don't know about that I would probably tend more towards strict
equivalence to the underlying API to reduce confusion.

	* The NS prefix is kind of redundant on C#, since you
	  got namespaces: the C-like namespace avoidance can
	  be eliminated this way.
[Urs] Absolutely positively NO: NSString, NSObject, NSArray or not String,
Object or Array and should never be confused with that, that is also valid
for all the other types like NSApplication.

However I would try to keep NSString, NSObject, NSArray, and NSDictionary as
much as possible internal, and for public API's I would try to use the .Net
versions of those types: string, object, []/IList, and IDictionary.  However
those types can be part of structures and therefore not just easily
converted, so I would definitely keep the prefix to clarify if it is a
string or an NSString you are dealing with.

Miguel
