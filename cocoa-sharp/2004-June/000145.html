<PRE>Ok folks, we have some decisions to make:

We will support a total custom name mapping, similar to the 
type-mapping we already support.  The name mapping will allow to 
customize the .Net method/property name from a given selector.  In 
Foundation, AppKit, and WebKit there are around 4540 distinguishable 
selectors, so we want to make general rules to get at least 95% right 
by those rules.

Some background about the issues of mapping:
1)	objective-c allows instance and class methods with the same name: - 
(id) class; + (id) class;
2)	objective-c allows C# keywords as methods names: (private, public, 
class, struct, ...)
3)	objective-c does not have properties, therefore we need to detect 
them with some pattern
4)	objective-c uses 'method: arg with: arg2' pattern, which results in 
'method:with:' selector

Proposal for rules:
1)	always start with lower case on instance methods/properties, and 
upper case on class methods/properties --&gt; object class { get; }, 
object Class { get; }
2)	postfix C# keyword names with a '_' --&gt; object class_ { get; }
3)	the following pattern will detect a property:
	- a 'set(\w+):' with void as return and one argument is a 'set' 
property
	- if there is a corresponding selector with return != void and no 
arguments, that is the 'get' property part.  The get property may just 
be the property name, or be prefixed by 'is' or 'get'
	- a methods with no arguments and return != void may be a get property 
[I don't know how likely and how we should detect that, may contain 
works like 'value']
4)	if we flatten method name and just use the first message part as 
.Net name, there will be conflicts, of having more the one method with 
the same signature.  Those conflicts are minimal and could be resolved 
by hand (in the XML mapping)

Those rules would be used to generated the xml file that can be 
manually changed for each selector in a global way, also we will allow 
change the global mapping on a class by class basis.

What do you think about that?
