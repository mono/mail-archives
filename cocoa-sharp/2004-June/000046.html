<PRE>Hey guys,

I think we need to get our own list together of stuff we need to do by 
the Mono 1.0 release.

Maybe its time we get our own project so we can track our bugs?  Its 
there a place like novell forge or source forge where we can get a 
project, but restrict its access?

If all we can do by Mono 1.0 is to get a fully functional 
/Library/Framework/Mono.framework install going then that's fine, hell 
that's great!

(I seem to remember in IRC that stated there were problem with this 
still, but since we don't have an official tracking system, I can't be 
sure.)

I'm just starting to feel a little like we aren't as cohesive in our 
efforts as we could be.

Adhamh
