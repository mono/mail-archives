<PRE>&gt;<i> I don't care too much about this one, as long as it can be automated since
</I>&gt;<i> we will generated them from the original headers.  Writing Cocoa apps will
</I>&gt;<i> require a lot of Cocoa specific knowledge and even some knowledge about
</I>&gt;<i> Objective-C messaging runtime behavior to understand how things fit
</I>&gt;<i> together, Objective-C is not strictly typed and otherwise does not fix
</I>&gt;<i> perfectly into the .Net universe.  Having different naming schemes will be
</I>&gt;<i> the least of evils in my opinion, and having the method names not match up
</I>&gt;<i> the Cocoa documentation will not help understand that complex framework.
</I>&gt;<i> But hey what do I know, I just wrote a two way bridge for that.
</I>
Well, I guess we have different things in mind when it comes to a Cocoa
binding.  Nothing wrong with either one, but I think you are missing a
good opportunity. 

&gt;<i> &gt; System.Object != NS.Object
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; System.Array != NS.Array
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; System.String != NS.String
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We also have `Gtk.Object' and `GLib.Object' in Gtk# as an example.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please don't offend me!  You of all should know me better!  Of course I know
</I>&gt;<i> that, but I still don't like that since System is normally in the 'using'
</I>&gt;<i> space and there for you would have to prefix the NS* object even if you are
</I>&gt;<i> in the given namespace, and that just makes it cumbersome and very ugly
</I>&gt;<i> especially since those will be in the namespace Apple.Foundation!
</I>
Not true.

Withing the namespace and the using statements, you dont have to prefix
it things, hence your confussion.

But even if you did, I dont see NS.Object to be any worse than NSObject
