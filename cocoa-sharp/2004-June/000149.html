</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I personally need some more background to understand, maybe a couple of
</I>&gt;<i> sample test cases would be useful.
</I>
Example of #1:
+ (id) class;
- (id) class;
Both of these exist in NSObject; 1 of them is a static method; 1 is an  
instance method.

Example of #2:
NSButton/NSBrowser (pretty much any gui object) uses a delegate (not a  
C# delegate; an objc delegate) to control behaviours; as a result they  
implement 2 methods:

- (id)delegate:
- (void)setDelegate:(id)aDelegate;

In cases where we detect &quot;function&quot;/set&quot;Function&quot; we combine these into  
a property like soo

public object Delegate {
	get { return NSBrowser_delegate(Raw); }
	set { NSBrowser_setDelegate(Raw, value); }
}

Example #3:
	See #2; we're detecting and generating properties based on a set of  
rules.

Example #4:
-  
(BOOL)shouldCloseWindowController:delegate:shouldCloseSelector: 
contextInfo:

in C# terms this is

public bool MethodName(bool arg1, object arg2, object arg3, object  
arg4){}

We're trying to determine the &quot;rules&quot; to create method name; currently  
we're flattening into
shouldCloseWindowController_delegate_shouldCloseSelector_contextInfo;  
but this is very very long.

We have now created a mapping xml to allow us to edit and tweak any of  
these rules; this discussion is based around naming conventions and  
what we want to do.

(Please not; my use of &quot;object&quot; isn't actually the case in most cases;  
I just didn't look up the actual arg value)

&gt;<i> Do you mean:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> class Demo {
</I>&gt;<i> 	static object ClassMethod ()
</I>&gt;<i> 	{
</I>&gt;<i> 	}
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	object instanceMethod ()
</I>&gt;<i> 	{
</I>&gt;<i> 	}
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That is what was meant.
&gt;<i> If so, this is not a good idea for two reasons:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	* It is not CLS compliant (which means, no VB.NET support, Lisp,
</I>&gt;<i> 	  or Fortran).
</I>
&gt;<i> 	* It does not follow the naming conventions of .NET
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If there is a name clash, I would rather deal with those clashes on a
</I>&gt;<i> case-by-case basis.   Can we make a generalization about class methods
</I>&gt;<i> vs instance methods?  Are they typically factory methods?  Are they
</I>&gt;<i> typically helper routines that are just namespaced?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That is a good point; but what we're trying to determine with this  
thread is a consistent rule to pick for the &quot;default&quot; then we can hand  
tweak any remaining conflicts as needed.
