<PRE>Hello,

   Oops, accidentally pressed control-enter before finishing.

&gt;<i> Great.  In that case, we need to make the API as easy-to-learn by people
</I>&gt;<i> who use .NET on Unix platforms as possible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What should that API look like, if it is not going to look like ObjC and
</I>&gt;<i> Cocoa?  I vote that we make it look like glib#.  The closer we can get
</I>&gt;<i> the API to look, the more comfortable those who develop for glib and
</I>&gt;<i> glib# will be with Cocoa#.
</I>
In general, the best way of designing your API is to follow the coding
guidelines that Microsoft/ECMA designed: a lot of effort went in there
from Microsoft and third parties to make things consistent.

They have maintained it to address new issues that people have come up
with, and have tools that can assist you in improving your API (FxCop:
but it requires Windows).

Another important reason to follow the conventions (and if you are able
to also do CLS compliance) is that your API is not only available to C#
programmer, but also to other languages (VB.NET and JScript are coming
in Mono 1.2, as well as the third party languages like Smalltalk,
Eiffel, Python and others).

I am too busy to contribute code, but I can provide some mentoring based
on the experience we have accumulated over the past couple of years with
Mono.

Am glad to see that you are interested in making this a good API for the
.NET side of things.

Miguel.
