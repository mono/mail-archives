<PRE>Hi Steve,

Fink certainly not required for the Mono runtime installation.

However I do not know why you are having the described problem, but =
somebody
on the list CC'ed might know.  Just a lucky guess is that probably =
anybody I
know is using 10.3.x by now and it could be related to that.

Thanks for reporting the issue, and the packager, the mono team and the
cocoa# team will have a look at your problem.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Hey guys,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Miguel just dropped by and asked me to post this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;The packages that we expect to go out for 1.0 are available for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;download. You can find them at:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;<A HREF="http://go-mono.com/download2.html">http://go-mono.com/download2.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;If you have any problems, please do not hesitate to reply.
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> I've been meaning to try an OS X installation and this announcement
</I>&gt;<i> finally got me to take action.  The installer ran without a hitch --
</I>&gt;<i> thanks to everyone involved in this packaging effort!  However...
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> There's no visible readme, no instructions in the installer, no =
</I>obvious
&gt;<i> information on what to do after installing.  I did a search for the =
</I>file
&gt;<i> &quot;mcs&quot; and found it in =
</I>Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/1.0/bin/.
&gt;<i> All well and good, so I tried invoking it (with no arguments), and =
</I>got:
&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> dyld: /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/1.0/bin/mono can't =
</I>open
&gt;<i> library: /usr/lib/libiconv.2.dylib  (No such file or directory, errno =
</I>=3D 2)
&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> No doubt I'm being quite thick, and my lack of Unix expertise is =
</I>shining
&gt;<i> brightly for all to see, but... what exactly do I need to do to =
</I>actually
&gt;<i> run the Mono tools on OS X?  For those of us who know C# and the Mac, =
</I>but
&gt;<i> don't know Unix, it would be nice to include some brief instructions =
</I>with
&gt;<i> the installer.
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> Additional information:
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> * I'm running OS X 10.2.8.  It's a fairly vanilla setup for the most =
</I>part.
&gt;<i> At some point in the past I did install Fink, though I've never =
</I>really
&gt;<i> used it.
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> * I searched for files containing &quot;libiconv&quot; in the name.  There is a =
</I>link
&gt;<i> named libiconv.2.dylib in /sw/lib, pointing to
</I>&gt;<i> /sw/lib/libiconv.2.0.4.dylib -- presumably this was part of my Fink
</I>&gt;<i> installation.  There's nothing resembling a libiconv file in =
</I>/usr/lib.  Is
&gt;<i> Fink a prerequisite for installing Mono 1.0?  Any particular version =
</I>of
&gt;<i> Fink?  Should I be tweaking my path to reference /sw/lib?
</I>&gt;<i>=20
