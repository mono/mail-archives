<PRE>Nice to see some life in this list!

A quick intro:

- In Oregon

- I'm a shoddy programmer (except when it comes to Perl and C# optimization)

- Been using UNIX for years, almost 20 now, which is scary. Do a lot
of Perl, shell, and the occasional c stuff.

- I do a lot of programming in C# on Windows, mainly for work stuff,
along with some network fun stuff on the side when I get time. I love
.NET and hope to see its functionality realized on the OS X platform.

- I'm a Mac zealot, as of Sept 2001 (OS X 10.1 release date). I went
down to the local Apple joint and played with 10.1 for an hour and
found it was usable, unlike 10.0 and ordered a G4 mac that day. I had
used NEXTSTEP in the past, so I knew it was a solid OS underneath.

- I dabble with Cocoa and ObjC, and understand most of the concepts
and syntax well.

- At some point, when things settle down here some, I hope to be able
to give some of my time to this project and help out where I can. I
think that .NET style platforms are the future, and I'm absolutely
thrilled to see that a project like Cocoa# exists.

cheers,
/per
