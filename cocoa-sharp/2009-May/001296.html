<PRE>I would like to help in any way I can to advance the development of  
Mono on Macintosh computers.  I am particularly interested in helping  
make the Mac more friendly to truly portable programming by creating a  
variant of the standard libraries that use a native GUI API instead of  
the klutzy X11 interface.  I read some time back that Mono was moving  
toward making the implementation of System.Windows.Form 100% C#  
relying on System.Drawing for it graphic primitives instead of any  
other graphics package, so that only System.Drawing needs to be  
adapted to the host system.  How is that coming along?  I realize that  
a variant of System.Drawing is still a big undertaking.  I was hoping  
that the work might be simplified by building on one of the existing  
Cocoa wrappers, such as Cocoa#, Monobjc, mobjc, or NObjective.

Is someone doing something like this?  If so, how can I contribute?   
If not, how can I start a project for developing the variant of  
System.Drawing that I described?  Can I help the development of other  
libraries I mentioned?  Do you have any suggestions?

I am a Mac enthusiast and an experienced programmer with the resources  
to develop and test programs on a PowerPC Mac running 10.4, an Intel  
one running 10.5, and MS-Windows XP.

</PRE>
