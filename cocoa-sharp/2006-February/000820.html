<PRE>I'm assuming that since we post patches to the list that we can't  
commit changes ourselves.

I have a question...

I submitted the one patch, and now I have another one that finishes  
off the Cell class.  Besides creating a whole new copy of the repo  
somewhere on my computer and starting over again, is there a way to  
keep like a side by side copy that I can work on so that I don't have  
like 3 or 4 repos laying around while I wait for a patch to be  
commited?  I'm not sure what it is called, a friend told me a branch  
but I'm not sure if thats what I'm wanting or not.

Here's what I'm talking about...
I submitted the TableView patch yesterday, it changed the changelog.
I could create another patch from a fresh repo for the cell class,  
but it also changes the changelog, that would create a conflict.
Now I want to work on the ImageCell, and if I do that then when I run  
svn diff it would not only capture the changes I just made but those  
that I made to Cell
But if I create a third clean repo and then create imagecell it to  
would modify changlog creating yet another conflict...

Whats the smart way of doing this?

Thoughts of future taunt me,
thoughts of present haunt me,
thoughts of past forget me.
