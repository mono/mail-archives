&gt;<i>Anyway, SimpleTutorial's Main looks more
</I>&gt;<i>correct to my eye
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I doubt that it's more *correct*, it's simply more complex. The Hello 
World tutorial has been written from scratch as a truly minimal tutorial 
for users new to Cocoa and possibly to a Mac (to get you started without 
much work), and this includes not copying in debug outputs that are not 
meaningful to you and not necessary when it runs, which it is obviously 
designed for. I should have stated in the Wiki: it was prepared on 
Panther and tested with 1.1.8.x (and based on code working also in a 
number of previous versions).

There is no relevant Application.Init() documentation in the Wiki or 
recently on this list, and Monodoc has not yet been released, so the 
decribed misbehavior on 10.4 is either an undocumented feature or more 
severe a bug in Cocoa#. The exception apparently is thrown through the 
invocation of Application.Init() while trying to access the main bundle 
which has at that stage not yet been loaded by 
Application.LoadNib(&quot;helloworld.nib&quot;) and therefore has difficulties 
casting it. That's what I read from the quoted debug output.

Using the [Register()] attribute on the main class would &quot;register&quot; it 
as an Objective-C class - for reasons I do not understand in that 
example... I usually only do that for NSObject-based classes that are 
accessed by Cocoa# methods and need to be visible to Obj-C code, my data 
sources for example, or a controller class if you're working with nibs. 
--- How can a static Init() method with no arguments rely upon the 
calling class having a certain attribute? Is the call stack being 
analysed to get at the class Type?! If Cocoa# really depends on the 
calling class then we should either be provided a base Application class 
that has appropriate instance methods instead of static methods, or an 
argument should be added to the Init method and throw an 
ArgumentException if it does not match the criteria Cocoa# requires to 
operate on.
