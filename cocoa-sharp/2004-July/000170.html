<PRE>Thank you for the information. Cool.

I have installed the 1.0 release, after deleting /opt/local to 
eliminate the beta, and it seems to be fine.

Except for the man pages! When I installed the betas in /opt/local, the 
man pages for mono just worked; but when I installed beta 2 and now 1.0 
in /Library/Frameworks, the man pages do not work. What magic is 
involved in properly hooking up the man pages?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I do have some questions, however, about the specific approach with

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. During the betas the initial binary installer support for MacOS X 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> installed in /opt/local; beta 2 first installed in /Library/Framework 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and then later in both; beta 3 installs in both; release 1.0

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than the other? With the /opt/local install the man pages worked but 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the /Library/Framework version of beta 2 it did not. Is a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /opt/local version of release 1 on the way?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Regardless of where mono is installed, there are no uninstall 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> notes at all! A brief note on which files/settings need to be removed 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or modified to safely remove a mono install from a MacOS X system 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be helpful, especially if one is switching from the /opt/local 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the /Library/Frameworks install versions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. While I have used UNIX based systems in the past, I am less than 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> completely comfortable with understanding all of the ins and outs of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> installing all of the required base packages required to use some of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the derived packages, such as MonoDevelop. I understand that there is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a reasonable amount of source installs, and the suggestion is to use 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Fink and a hint is used to install them in the same location as mono 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (/opt/local during the betas), but then all of the rest is left as an 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exercise! It would be truly useful to publish a step-by-step guide of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which packages to install in which order (using Fink or any other 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tools) and in the 'proper' location based on the mono install. I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tried doing this myself and go so lost in all of the options and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> versions available and the errors being reported that I finally gave 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4. Will there ever be a binary installer for MacOS X that will 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> include all of the dependencies themselves and MonDevelop and others?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thank you for your time.
