<PRE>Well strings have another issue, that is that the objc-runtime will =
release
them in the next idle loop, if u don't retain them using 'retain' to
increase the retainCount, since all objects that are returned using =
static
messages by convention are using 'autorelease'.

The BrowserItem does not only have to hold on the NSString object, it =
also
has to retain it.  I'll check in a version to show what I mean with it.

Some other things we need to work on:

- NIB file integration
I will be investigation what is needed for that.  Since it would make
perfect sense to me to design monodoc in IB and just have the =
datasource and
main controller in .net.
