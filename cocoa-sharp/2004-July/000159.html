<PRE>Ken,

thanks for your email.

1) We've chosen to go with the /Library/Framework way (with links to 
/usr/bin) for it seemed the most friendly and closest to the MacOS X 
ways.
2) I believe you just have to go to the packages directory and double 
click on the Mono installer to de-install it. Maybe the cocoa# list can 
help us with that question
3) and 4), yes we're working on it. We're reached one goal where we 
provide a working installer for Mono only on MacOS X. We're going to 
try to make it easier on MacOS in general now, providing Monodoc, 
Monodevelop and GTK/GTK# packages. I suggest the cocoa# list for 
information on XCode+Mono as well as the bindings of course and a 
general source of great information on Mono MacOS X from the Mac 
community

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. During the betas the initial binary installer support for MacOS X 
</I>&gt;<i> installed in /opt/local; beta 2 first installed in /Library/Framework 
</I>&gt;<i> and then later in both; beta 3 installs in both; release 1.0 currently

</I>&gt;<i> installers? Will there always be the two? Is one 'better' than the 
</I>&gt;<i> other? With the /opt/local install the man pages worked but with the 
</I>&gt;<i> /Library/Framework version of beta 2 it did not. Is a /opt/local 
</I>&gt;<i> version of release 1 on the way?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Regardless of where mono is installed, there are no uninstall notes 
</I>&gt;<i> at all! A brief note on which files/settings need to be removed or 
</I>&gt;<i> modified to safely remove a mono install from a MacOS X system would 
</I>&gt;<i> be helpful, especially if one is switching from the /opt/local to the 
</I>&gt;<i> /Library/Frameworks install versions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. While I have used UNIX based systems in the past, I am less than 
</I>&gt;<i> completely comfortable with understanding all of the ins and outs of 
</I>&gt;<i> installing all of the required base packages required to use some of 
</I>&gt;<i> the derived packages, such as MonoDevelop. I understand that there is 
</I>&gt;<i> a reasonable amount of source installs, and the suggestion is to use 
</I>&gt;<i> Fink and a hint is used to install them in the same location as mono 
</I>&gt;<i> (/opt/local during the betas), but then all of the rest is left as an 
</I>&gt;<i> exercise! It would be truly useful to publish a step-by-step guide of 
</I>&gt;<i> which packages to install in which order (using Fink or any other 
</I>&gt;<i> tools) and in the 'proper' location based on the mono install. I tried 
</I>&gt;<i> doing this myself and go so lost in all of the options and versions 
</I>&gt;<i> available and the errors being reported that I finally gave up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Will there ever be a binary installer for MacOS X that will include 
</I>&gt;<i> all of the dependencies themselves and MonDevelop and others?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your time.
