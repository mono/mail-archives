Uh, uninstall?   What is uninstall?  Mac OS X has never had an 
uninstaller.  This is supposed to be fixed &quot;soon&quot;  But we have been 
hearing that since Mac OS X Public Beta.  This commands (as root) 
should uninstall it manually

rm -r /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework
rm -r /Library/Receipts/MonoFramework-1.0.pkg
cd /usr/bin
for i in `ls -al | grep Mono | awk '{print $9}'; do
rm ${i}
done

note, I typing quickly as my battery is dying so you might want to 
double check this.

I'll put this on my TODO list, write an uninstall script.

</I>&gt;<i> community
</I>&gt;<i>

There might be more Xcode integration in the future, but not until 
Apple makes some software publicly available, or at least allows me to 
publicly release things that I build with the Xcode SDK.

Binary installer for everything is coming. Please stay tuned.
