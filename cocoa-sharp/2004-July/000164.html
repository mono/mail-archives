<PRE>Some manpath magic. Installing in /Library/Framework definitely has its 
downside.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> First, congratulations on release 1.0!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I have programmed in a large number of languages on a large number 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of platforms, and recently I have been researching and use C# and 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> .Net on the Windows platform for work (paid employment). Personally 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I have had at least one Mac at home (we currently have four) since 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the late 80's, put have seldom done much programming on them because 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of the learning curve and cost. I discovered REALbasic as a 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> reasonable cost approach, and developed some utilities to support my 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> hobbies and love (officiating Little League baseball, purely as a 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> volunteer). Then I heard that Mono would be a cross-platform 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> alternative, and I was excited!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I do have some questions, however, about the specific approach with 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> respect to support for MacOS X.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1. During the betas the initial binary installer support for MacOS X 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> installed in /opt/local; beta 2 first installed in 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> /Library/Framework and then later in both; beta 3 installs in both; 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> release 1.0 currently only has an installer for /Library/Framework. 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Why the two separate installers? Will there always be the two? Is 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> one 'better' than the other? With the /opt/local install the man 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> pages worked but with the /Library/Framework version of beta 2 it 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> did not. Is a /opt/local version of release 1 on the way?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Regardless of where mono is installed, there are no uninstall 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> notes at all! A brief note on which files/settings need to be 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> removed or modified to safely remove a mono install from a MacOS X 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> system would be helpful, especially if one is switching from the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> /opt/local to the /Library/Frameworks install versions.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 3. While I have used UNIX based systems in the past, I am less than 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> completely comfortable with understanding all of the ins and outs of 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> installing all of the required base packages required to use some of 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the derived packages, such as MonoDevelop. I understand that there 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is a reasonable amount of source installs, and the suggestion is to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> use Fink and a hint is used to install them in the same location as 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> mono (/opt/local during the betas), but then all of the rest is left 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> as an exercise! It would be truly useful to publish a step-by-step 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> guide of which packages to install in which order (using Fink or any 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> other tools) and in the 'proper' location based on the mono install. 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I tried doing this myself and go so lost in all of the options and 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> versions available and the errors being reported that I finally gave 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> up.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 4. Will there ever be a binary installer for MacOS X that will 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> include all of the dependencies themselves and MonDevelop and 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> others?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thank you for your time.
