<PRE>All,

Just giving you a heads up. Miguel was able to hook me up with write access
and I quickly got to work. The following changes were made and are captured
in the appropriate ChangeLog entry.

    * Cursor.cs: Added to repository
    * Font.cs:   Added to repository
    * Event.cs:  Added to repository
    * Makefile.am: Updated to have make include the above files.
    * Color.cs:
        Added Set, SetFill, SetStroke, and DrawSwatchInRect.
    * BezierPath.cs:
        Added enumerations for drawing. Added StrokeRect method
        as well as some documentation.
    * Point.cs:
        Added Equals, ==, != operator overloads, and GetHashCode()
    * Rect.cs:
        Added Contains and ToString methods
    * String.cs:
        Updated ToString() to use UTF-8 encoding as it was the straight
        c string was causing down stream problems. For what it is worth.
               This encoding is recommended by Apply post 10.3
    * View.cs:
        Added a bunch of event handlers for mouse and keyboard interaction.
        Added OnDrawRect as virtual method for client to override as
necessary.
        Added AcceptsFirstReponder virtual method in order to get keyboard
        interactivity working.
    * Window.cs:
        Added InvalidateCursorRectsForView, Display, and OrderFront methods

I then deleted my existing code directory and built from scratch...all is
well. I also rebuilt my simple drawing tutorial, and all is well there too.

I've got just a little bit more work on this tutorial and toss it up into
the SVN repository as well as the Google Group.

Enjoy,
Todd
