&gt;<i> yes, we are looking at Monobjc, currently, as  a ore feasible solution 
</I>&gt;<i> than Cocoa#. the problem is that i, at least, am coming at this as a 
</I>&gt;<i> third party vendor, and as long as Cocoa# is the &quot;official&quot; library 
</I>&gt;<i> that ships with Mono, our customers expect us to support this. As it 
</I>&gt;<i> stads, if they start developing a Cocoa# app with our compiler, things 
</I>&gt;<i> blow because of Cocoa# bugs, and they blame us ;)
</I>Just to let the list know that I have been working with Marc on getting 
his product to work with OS X and would agree that, unless the Cocoa# 
libraries are fixed soon, I can't see them getting much use.

I have found, so far, the Monobjc solution to be far easier to get 
working, with far less bugs.

Is there a possibility that Monobjc can be included in the Mono distro, 
as an alternative, so that folks will not think that a very broken 
Cocoa# is the only way to go ??
