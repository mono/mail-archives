I have NEVER EVER heard of someone porting a Cocoa app to Windows.  It 
would require that you rewrite the entire app in something like mono or C++.

I don't know about the GNUStep option.  I don't really know anything 
about GNUStep though either.  If you port the app to GNUStep I suppose 
that would work.  Does GNUSTEP run under Windows?  I think it is its own 
OS and replaces windows though... 

Is this application something anyone has heard of?
