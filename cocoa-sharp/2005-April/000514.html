<PRE>Hi,

I have worked 3 years with GnuStep/MinGW for a cross platform server  
in ObjectiveC with a front end in Java. It was a port/new development  
of a old NeXT application. The front end in Java was communicating by  
xml encoding. The ObjectiveC part was very hudge, and GNUstep has  
been very good for the task.

Sincerely I would investigate a little more  the GNUstep way, because  
Appkit have evolved since one year, and It would need less work do  
dev somme missed Cocoa widget.

Best regards

    Gerard

&gt;&gt;<i> Well, that's partly porting / partly rewritting.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Apparently GNUstep base (the 'FoundationKit') work well and seems  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reliable. And let you port easily things.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Regarding AppKit that's an other matter which would requires  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rewritting.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I haven't heard of this application before (being hired) but some  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> client do, apparently ^_^. it's
