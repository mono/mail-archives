Kang, can you explain this for a novice user? Does that mean it's not
possible in 1.1.6?
Attached is my original message I tried to post to the list yesterday...

The way I'm planning on doing it is the same way the libSDL guys do it on
mac;

take a look at their code; I just havn't gotten around to it yet

patches are appreciated :)

Hi there,

I'm new to the Mac and interested in porting my .NET Windows app to Cocoa#.
I've just installed MonoFramework-1.1.6-4.dmg the weekend. After managing to
compile and run a small sample application (empty NSWindow using C#), I
tried to extend my app a little... Is there currently any way to have a
custom menu?! I've already searched the Wiki and the mailing list archive
(and Google). No sample application except for the old CurrencyConverter
seemed to attempt this.
I tried creating a .nib for the menu, it didn't make a change. I tried using
NSMenu/NSMenuItem and both of NSApplication.mainMenu and .appleMenu, it
crashed the app. It's always just titled &quot;mono&quot;, &quot;Hide mono&quot;, &quot;Quit mono&quot;
etc. I figured out this is probably because MyName.app starts the
./Contents/MacOS/MyName script which in turn calls &quot;mono&quot; for my assembly?
Is there currently any (easy) way to have my own menu? I did manage to once,
with both window and menu inside a .nib using the old release from the Apple
site... But my UI will probably get too complex for a .nib file, I believe,
and I'd rather use .NET-based localization instead of a .nib-based approach.

Also BTW, assigning .applicationIconImage as in the examples didn't seem to
work for me, always the standard icon in the dock and when switching apps; I
needed to add CFBundleIconFile to Info.plist for the icon to show up. I did
try both the Resources and the MacOS folder (to which the script apparently
changes directory), both for .nib and .icns, both with and without
extension.

Any ideas?

Regards,

Andreas
