<PRE>Well, that's partly porting / partly rewritting.
Apparently GNUstep base (the 'FoundationKit') work well and seems reliable. 
And let you port easily things.
Regarding AppKit that's an other matter which would requires rewritting.
I haven't heard of this application before (being hired) but some client do, 
apparently ^_^. it's

Anyway, go back to the original question: how does Coca# work?
Because I would like to make my ObjectiveC class available to .NET and need 
good idea!

Otherwise I think I will create a code generator which, given some class's 
header, will generate a C library wrapper around the ObjectiveC object and 
some DLlImport C# class. But if there is any better way I'm curious to 
know...
