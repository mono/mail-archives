<PRE>There are a few reason to go the .NET way.
the real one is I know and love .NET.
but I could add I would be much more productive writing code and GUI with 
VS.NET than ObjectiveC code with notepad (particularly, but not only, the 
GUI design phase).
Also most of non-microsoft designed GUI (based on other toolset, I mean) are 
all ugly looking (or at least not much windowish), whereas a .NET based 
toolkit would follow user application and looks like any oter application.
beside the .NET binding, from what I have been answering so far, looks very 
interesting!
I see no interest in using Java as I have used it for many years and since I 
have switch to .NET I have no desire to go back.

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have worked 3 years with GnuStep/MinGW for a cross platform server  in 
</I>&gt;<i> ObjectiveC with a front end in Java. It was a port/new development  of a 
</I>&gt;<i> old NeXT application. The front end in Java was communicating by  xml 
</I>&gt;<i> encoding. The ObjectiveC part was very hudge, and GNUstep has  been very 
</I>&gt;<i> good for the task.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sincerely I would investigate a little more  the GNUstep way, because 
</I>&gt;<i> Appkit have evolved since one year, and It would need less work do  dev 
</I>&gt;<i> somme missed Cocoa widget.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Gerard
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Well, that's partly porting / partly rewritting.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Apparently GNUstep base (the 'FoundationKit') work well and seems 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> reliable. And let you port easily things.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Regarding AppKit that's an other matter which would requires 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> rewritting.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I haven't heard of this application before (being hired) but some 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> client do, apparently ^_^. it's
