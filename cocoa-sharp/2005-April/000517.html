<PRE>Before I go bugzilla crawling...

It looks like MacPack &amp; Cocoa# have some limitations regarding NIB 
loading (language stuff) and dealing with the info.plist.

Let's start with the NIB loading issue, in my testing it appears that 
the current implementation of the NIB loader (Application.LoadNib()) 
can only handle a single nib and doesn't do any switching based upon 
the language, as I understand it, the normal Cocoa loader loads the nib 
by current language and falls back to a default via the language.lproj 
folders (I'm generalizing but that's the basic).

Second is the MacPack info.plist issue.  As far as I can tell, it looks 
like the info.plist that is generated is causing the app to assuming 
the name 'mono' and not use the bundle name.

Lastly, if I can solve these to weird issues, I'll have a Makefile 
based Xcode project tmeplate for a Cocoa# app that will build and 
package for release.

Andy
