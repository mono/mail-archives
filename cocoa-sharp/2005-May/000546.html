<PRE>&gt;<i> The nib files have to have the same name.  Instead of 
</I>&gt;<i> changing the name, change the relative path.
</I>&gt;<i> Don't try and do everything in one folder.  keep your 
</I>&gt;<i> dictionaries in separate folders as well.
</I>
The file name doesn't change the problem with the incremental dictionary, it
only needs to be the same inside My.app.

I've luckily just found a Perl skript that does the job for me, in case
someone's interested it's called tinyglot. Maybe when it's finally all
working for me I might add a tutorial to the Wiki... ;-)

&gt;<i> It won't search English.lproj if there is already a nib in 
</I>&gt;<i> the Resources 
</I>&gt;<i> Folder.  It is a &quot;top down&quot; search so that some resources can be 
</I>&gt;<i> non-localized and some localized.
</I>
I understand that, and there is no nib directly in the Resources folder. In
case there had been, I would've expected to see the wrong menu instead of no
custom menu at all.

Has anyone got this working on 1.1.7? Without a .lproj directory the nib
file works fine, which keeps me puzzling...

&gt;<i> Good luck.   No matter what, simultaneous support of many 
</I>&gt;<i> languages in Cocoa 
</I>&gt;<i> is complicated and time intensive. [...] If you 
</I>&gt;<i> really need to support many languages, you may need to 
</I>&gt;<i> increase your team.  
</I>&gt;<i> There's enough to worry about in Cocoa without worrying about 
</I>&gt;<i> supporting 15 
</I>&gt;<i> language versions of the App.
</I>
Thanks. I'm aware of that, and once I have a proof of concept I'm going to
concentrate on integrating the existing business logic into a Cocoa UI...
