<PRE>Here is the very basic version of my ObjectiveC/GNUstep-.NET binding (all 
'hand generated' so far), at least it's working!
(and tested with GNUstep GNUstep-base-1.10.1-gui-0.9.4.exe and VC# express 
beta 2.
it work on the command line but, somehow, when I use the VC# express debuger 
it fails to load the interop DLL for some reason, maybe it's messing up with 
GNUstep's dependency on MSVCR70.dll?
)

there was a few problem, like the missing objc_msgSend() (and no, an 
arglist_t is NOT equivalent to a va_list).
and in messaging, I had to pass additional parameters to the MethodBuilder 
(strangely enough).

I'm going for the header parser now.

To compile:
make (with GNUstep's dev environment) in ObjcGlu (some runtime helper 
function) and ProjObjc (a test ObjC library)
then launch the VC# project in TestApp/TestApp.sln =&gt; build
Modify the Runtime.cs file at line:77 &amp; 78 to set up correct path for 
GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT &amp; PATH to the native libraries (the ../../../Libraries 
directory)

For some reson using ConfigurationManager make the program crash. And for 
some other reason VC# debuger crash, it's why I have to use the command 
line, sorry :(

Once everything is compiled you could run from the command line....
Later I think I will embed/wrap objcsharp.dll in a managed assembly as a 
resource, would be much nicer, wouldn't it?
