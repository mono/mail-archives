<PRE>Hi people,

I&#185;ve just spent a very enjoyable evening browsing through the archives here
after downloading the 1.2 release of mono for OSX (dmg) but I think I must
be missing something fairly fundamental.

I&#185;ve worked through what I can find on the wiki and I like what I see. If
I&#185;m right then cocoa# is designed as a way to use native Cocoa frameworks
with mono which is good as I&#185;m your typical windows dev by day, mac user by
night kind of person.

But - and there&#185;s always a but or I guess I&#185;d just get on with it!!

All the samples I can find and every relevent post I can see in the archives
suggest that &#179;using Apple.Foundation;&#178;, &#179;using Apple;&#178;, &#179;using
Apple.AppKit;&#178; and so on should work just fine and in fact should be fairly
fundamental to this whole process.

Sadly, I&#185;m getting the message &#179;The type or namespace name `Apple' could not
be found. Are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?&#178; (for
instance).


Now, I&#185;ve tried the &#179;Hello World&#178; example and that worked great, so I know
that mono itself is fine but the &#179;SimpleTutotial&#178; example just doesn&#185;t want
to play ball at all.

I&#185;m sure I&#185;ve done something tragically simple, any ideas?

Here&#185;s the rundown:

Installed from official 1.2 dmg (to /Library/Frameworks folder)
Using OSX 10.4.8 
On Intel iMac
With latest updated X11 (came out a few days back).
Xcode 2.4.1 and all associated SDKs installed.

Any pointers much appreciated!

Thanks,
Martin.
