<PRE>Hi, all.

I couldn't find information about this anywhere on the web, so I figured I'd
drop the mailing list a line and just ask.

I'm investigating options for rebuilding an application that I expect to
require many of the more advanced components of Cocoa, although I honestly
don't know which components would be used on the Mac.

One option is to build it using Java Swing. Personally I'd like not to,
because Java Swing is both sluggish and ugly. However, it does offer the
benefit of working quite well on all platforms and being very mature in
terms of stability, documentation and developer experience.

I'd like to suggest .NET/Mono instead, using Windows.Forms on Windows but
CocoaSharp on Mac OS X, but for that, I need to be relatively confident in
CocoaSharp being mature enough.

1. Does CocoaSharp already support all the widgets and classes that can be
found in Cocoa?
2. Is there a particular aspect of typical Cocoa use that either hasn't been
implemented or is particularly troublesome at the moment?
3. Are there any professional-grade applications using CocoaSharp already?
4. Is the current status of the project published somewhere regularly by
other means than bulletins on individual features?

Thanks in advance.

Kind regards,
Helgi Hrafn Gunnarsson
