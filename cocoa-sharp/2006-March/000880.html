<PRE>I have run into some memory management issues.

I found out that I have to create an AutoReleasePool instance for each of the Mono threads I create 

and release the pool at appropriate places.

 

After doing that I found more memory management issues.

I would expect that the objective-c instances to stay around as long as the bridging managed instance 

has not been garbage collected. This is currently not the case.

 

A.

In objective-c all class methods which create and return an object instance will be added to the auto

release pool in effect on that thread. One typical example here is: stringWithUTF8String: on NSString 

which is used for the implementation of  &quot;new Cocoa.String( System.String init)&quot;.

 

If an application keeps a reference to a Cocoa.String the native instance will be released during the 

next release of the active auto release pool (this is automatic for the UI thread), and if the string 

is used later the application will likely crash.

 

B.

For all default constructors in Cocoa# the corresponding objective-c instances will have a retain count 

of 1 since we call &quot;alloc&quot; in the constructor of Cocoa.Object.

I don't think the objective-c instances ever gets deallocated. 

So we have a memory leak for each alloc call is made through Cocoa#.

 

Fix:

As far as I can see it should be possible to modify the Cocoa# library to handle all lifetime issues 

(except for adding the auto release pools). All the objective-c instances which have a live corresponding 

Cocoa# instances should have a retain count of 1 - because of the existence of the Cocoa# bridge object.

That means there must be an explicit call to the &quot;retain&quot; message for each objective-c class method that 

creates and returns an object instance.

The destructor of Cocoa.Object should decrement this retain count.

 

With this approach the lifetime of all Cocoa# objects follows rules of the Mono garbage collector - and 

users of the Cocoa# library would not have to learn much about Cocoa memory management.

 

Does anybody have any insight or comments?

BTW:

If you do not add the AutoReleasePool you will get debug messages from Cocoa like:

 

    *** _NSAutoreleaseNoPool(): Object 0x6aaa0 of class NSCFString autoreleased with no pool in place - just leaking

    *** _NSAutoreleaseNoPool(): Object 0x6ab40 of class NSCFString autoreleased with no pool in place - just leaking

 

In the code I was dealing with I had a timer which would eventually end up using some Cocoa# code.

This is how I added the auto release pool:

 

private void MyElapsedEventHandler(object source, ElapsedEventArgs e) {

  Cocoa.AutoReleasePool pool = new Cocoa.AutoReleasePool();

  try {

    CallWhatEverMethodNeeded();

  }

  finally {

    // until this is handled by the Cocoa# library

    ObjCMessaging.objc_msgSend (pool.NativeObject, &quot;release&quot;, typeof(void));

    pool = null;

  }

}
