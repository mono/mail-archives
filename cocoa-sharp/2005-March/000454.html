Brian -

Most of the work of learning Cocoa is not the Objective-C language,  
but the Cocoa frameworks themselves. Since the majority of the  
documentation on Cocoa assumes Objective-C knowledge (albeit not  
much) it helps to get at least a reading familiarity with the syntax.  
This reminds me of the early days of the Macintosh APIs, when all the  
documentation was published in Pascal, which I always translated in  
my head to C. Pascal is a language I find quite easy to read, but  
I've never a line of it in my entire career.

 From what I understand so far, using Cocoa# isn't going to provide  
you with a way to deploy to the &quot;world.&quot; It is simply a way to use  
the Cocoa frameworks from C# on top of the Mono runtime. The  
resulting code will be very much tied to Mac OS X.
