<PRE>I think your quest about the IDE is the hardest part right now.  I too am a c# developer by day Mac user by night.  

Here is what I have found so far regarding IDE's.  None of these solutions are ideal in my opinion.  Someone has created C# projects for XCode that you can install and use.  It does syntax highlighting and some project management, but there is no code completion.  Then there is Eclipse, which has a module that can be added for C# apparently it has code completion for Windows but on the Mac all i get is syntax highlighting.  SubEtha has C# syntax hightlighting as well that can be added in.  I also tried Monodevelop, but it is VERY unstable at this point and I can't get past the splash screen on that one. 

So what I have decided is to go with XCode and try to modify the projects that were nicely provided to work better with Cocoa#.  I have realized through this whole process how much i rely on code completion, which I really miss.   A much more complete C# IDE for the mac would really get things going.  I have heard from tons of people that are really interested but strugling with this part.

&gt;<i> Thanks to all who are helping me figure this out.  So it sounds like
</I>&gt;<i> Cocoa# isn't a bad plan at all.  There might be some user acceptance
</I>&gt;<i> factor in requiring the mono download, but if I target my software at
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Geeks Like Me&quot;, then it shouldn't be a problem at all.  So my next
</I>&gt;<i> steps should be to learn Cocoa, and figure out what to use as a
</I>&gt;<i> development environment.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What does everyone recommend for a development environment?  Is there
</I>&gt;<i> something with code completion?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
