<PRE>Hi,

this maybe (probably?) has come up before, but i couldn't find any 
reference to it, so here it goes:

As i've found out myself, recently, creating the wrapper classes needed 
to access the Cocoa objects from managed code is a very tedious and 
error prone process, which in tuen explains, of course, why such a small 
portion of Cocoa is actually exposed, so far. It's mind-numbing 
runt-work that no-one wants to do.

has anyone ever put any thought into creating a way to *automatically* 
or semi-automatically (ie with manual adjustments) generate these 
wrapper classes by, for example, parsing method headers from available 
.h files or the documentation?

if not, does anyone think this would be a good idea and would like to 
work with me on investigating this? (i'm very interested in this myself 
(else i wouldn't bring it up ;), but my spare time is severely limited 
these days, so i wouldn't want to take this up all by myself - but i'd 
certainly be happy to put effort and energy into this, if someone else 
will help out as well).


looking forward to your thoughts on this,

marc hoffman
