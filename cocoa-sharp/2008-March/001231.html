<PRE>Hi guys

I've tried to install the c# plugin for Xcode from
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/cocoa-sharp-dev/wiki/CSharpPlugin">http://code.google.com/p/cocoa-sharp-dev/wiki/CSharpPlugin</A>

I know that is out of date but is the only thing I found, also here
<A HREF="http://cocoa-sharp.com/">http://cocoa-sharp.com/</A>

is still quoted that page.

I tried first the installer (being a lazy boy) but that wasn't  
working, I didn't even get the templates,
after a while I found out that the installing directory was wrong, nor
~/Library/Application Support/Apple/Developer Tools/
/Library/Application Support/Apple/Developer Tools/

were searched by the starting Xcode (nor was /Library/Application  
Support/Developer/2.5/Xcode/ quoted here <A HREF="http://michelf.com/projects/">http://michelf.com/projects/</A> 
d-for-xcode/)

I found out it was /Developer/Library/Xcode
moved the template the only thing still not working was the plug-in  
itself that gives this error in the console

2008-03-27 23:47:58.648 Xcode[847] *** -[NSBundle load]: Error  
loading code /Developer/Library/Xcode/Plug-ins/ 
CSharpXcodePlugin.pbplugin/Contents/MacOS/CSharpXcodePlugin for  
bundle /Developer/Library/Xcode/Plug-ins/CSharpXcodePlugin.pbplugin,  
error code 4 (link edit error code 4, error number 0 (Library not  
loaded: /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/DevToolsCore.framework/ 
Versions/A/DevToolsCore
   Referenced from: /Developer/Library/Xcode/Plug-ins/ 
CSharpXcodePlugin.pbplugin/Contents/MacOS/CSharpXcodePlugin
   Reason: image not found))
2008-03-27 23:47:58.648 Xcode[847] WARNING: Failed to load plugin  
at: /Developer/Library/Xcode/Plug-ins/CSharpXcodePlugin.pbplugin,  
skipping.  Could not load bundle.

So I tried to compile from sources, but still there is something wrong.
As I open the project I see three red references. the first is the  
&quot;CSharpXcodePlugin.pbplugin&quot;
and that's ok, still to build...
But then I see also DevToolsCore.framework and  
DevToolsSupport.framework in red, alongside with Cocoa.framework  
that's black. I checked the paths and were wrong, and here the  
problems comes to a mess.
There are different directories namede DevToolsCore.framework and  
DevToolsSupport.framework I choosed the more likely
/Library/PrivateFrameworks/
but cannot find any headers to put in, just like the Cocoa.framework  
has.
If I go for a build I receive an error but can't see wich one it is,  
can't find any clear statement in Xcode output.

Anyone knows what I can do about this?
