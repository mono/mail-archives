<PRE>Thanks Edward, it is reassuring to hear that it is a known issue but
somewhat disappointing that such a fundamental problem has existed for so
long with no sign of it being addressed. Following the initial deafeningly
silent response to my post I have abandoned cocoa-sharp and gone back to the
somewhat more laborious task of porting my clients to pure obj-c. It seems a
shame but I cannot risk the issue not being resolved and ending up with
unusable applications.

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [Cocoa-sharp] Performance of UI
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Having got to grips with writing cocoa sharp applications over the past couple
</I>&gt;<i> of weeks I am experiencing a significant problem of UI performance, as noted
</I>&gt;<i> in another posting earlier this week. Even a simple &#140;Hello world&#185; application
</I>&gt;<i> shows significant screen lag when resizing and consumes disproportionate CPU
</I>&gt;<i> time, once you add a couple of views to a window resizing can consume 90% of
</I>&gt;<i> CPU time. Typing into a text field with an event attached can produce a lag of
</I>&gt;<i> a second or so between characters. As with all open source software when you
</I>&gt;<i> find these things there is always a strong possibility that this is to do with
</I>&gt;<i> local configuration, but in addition to the posting this week I note a thread
</I>&gt;<i> called &#140;Performance on Leopard&#185; last year discussing this issue with no
</I>&gt;<i> conclusion. Are others experiencing this ? If so is there anyone with insight
</I>&gt;<i> as to what the underlying issue is and what is required to resolve it. I see
</I>&gt;<i> cocoa sharp as the most sensible way to bring my web service based client
</I>&gt;<i> applications from Windows to OS X and would be very happy to contribute to the
</I>&gt;<i> open source effort, however this issue would seem to be a bit of a
</I>&gt;<i> showstopper.
