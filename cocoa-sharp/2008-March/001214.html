<PRE>Having got to grips with writing cocoa sharp applications over the past
couple of weeks I am experiencing a significant problem of UI performance,
as noted in another posting earlier this week. Even a simple &#140;Hello world&#185;
application shows significant screen lag when resizing and consumes
disproportionate CPU time, once you add a couple of views to a window
resizing can consume 90% of CPU time. Typing into a text field with an event
attached can produce a lag of a second or so between characters. As with all
open source software when you find these things there is always a strong
possibility that this is to do with local configuration, but in addition to
the posting this week I note a thread called &#140;Performance on Leopard&#185; last
year discussing this issue with no conclusion. Are others experiencing this
? If so is there anyone with insight as to what the underlying issue is and
what is required to resolve it. I see cocoa sharp as the most sensible way
to bring my web service based client applications from Windows to OS X and
would be very happy to contribute to the open source effort, however this
issue would seem to be a bit of a showstopper.
