<PRE>&gt;<i> You could do that; copy /usr/bin/mono into YourApp.app and 
</I>&gt;<i> rename it to whatever and hack the launcher; however this 
</I>&gt;<i> will have problems with foward compatability.
</I>
So it'll still work inside the bundle? No dependencies on the working
directory? Only on the variables in the script?

&gt;<i> The workaround long term is what SDL does on Mac; which if I 
</I>&gt;<i> remember correctly is remove the menu (twice) and then readd 
</I>&gt;<i> it with the real name.  If someone wants to dig further and 
</I>&gt;<i> spec this out I'll try to dedicate some time.
</I>
I've tried some similar things before my first post with NSMenu etc. in my
application (maybe I even explained what I did?) and all I got was
crashes...

But I'm not familiar with the Cocoa API. The only way I got started with
Cocoa# was by analyzing the Cocoa Sharp Browser sample and by copying the
three Cocoa# assemblies over to my Windows machine where I could use the VS
object browser and compare them to Apple's Cocoa documentation for Java, not
being familiar with Objective-C. That's why I would welcome any kind of
monodoc not requiring me to &quot;mess up&quot; my one and only Mac and its limited
harddrive capacity (I read someone was volunteering for the Cocoa# monodoc
documentation). Or alternatively some more and up-to-date Wiki contents (to
which I've already contributed small parts like the latest releases once
I've noticed them, and I was considering adding a short localization
tutorial).

So while I would've been willing to help with this effort, if I had the
knowledge and skills to do so I'd already have tried and posted. ;-)
