<PRE>Greetings,

I'm not sure if this is the best forum to ask this question - is this 
list intended for users of the cocoa-shrap framework or only for people 
who are developing the framework? If there's a more appropriate forum to 
ask this kindof question - I'll be happy to take it there.

I've written/ported a simple application in c# that makes use of the 
basic Mono class library and uses libgdiplus to do some drawing. I've 
also created a .nib-based interface using cocoa-sharp.

In order to get this application to compile and run on my system I 
needed to do the following:
- install tiger
- install x11 sdk (so that libgdiplus will work)
- install mono
- write some code
- compile with:
mcs -r:itextsharp.dll -r:ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.dll 
-r:System.Drawing.dll -out:App.exe App.cs AppController.cs 
-pkg:cocoa-sharp -unsafe

- 'macpack' with:
macpack -n:App -a:./App.exe -m:2 -o:. -r:App.nib 
-r:/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/lib/libCocoaSharpGlue.dylib 
-r:itextsharp.dll -r:ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.dll

Having done all this, on my system the application works (mostly - I'm 
still putting finishing touches on it). My question to other cocoa-sharp 
users / developers out there is:

If I put my App.app somewhere on the web for the world to see - what 
will users of my application need to install in order to be able to run 
it? Obviously they'll need mono - but do they also need to install the 
x11 sdk? Is there any way to bundle all the required libraries with my 
application. I'd really like to understand how libraries are linked in 
cocoa-sharp / mono applications. I think I get how 'macpack' embed some 
.dll libraries in the application bundle so that they can be loaded at 
runtime - but I'm not sure if I understand how the x11 libraries are 
accessed. Is libgdiplus simply a wrapper around some lower-level c 
libraries? If so - is there a way to bundle these libraries with my 
application?

 I'd like to minimise the things I ask people to install before using my 
application (when I get around to finishing it).

Regards,

Jake MacMullin
