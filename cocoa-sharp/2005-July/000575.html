<PRE>Hi,

Recently having updated from 1.1.7 to 1.1.8.1, localization with .lproj
folders now suddenly works for me!!! Thanks for any related changes you've
made! :-))

Has there also been progress on the menu and info dialog, any timeframe? The
menu name is still &quot;mono&quot;, which doesn't make the application look like a
native one ... which of course is the idea behind using Cocoa#.
Kangaroo mentioned a workaround but gave no further details.
My understanding is that the cause of these problems is the
&quot;my.app/Contents/MacOS/my&quot; script calling the native Mac application &quot;mono&quot;
which interprets the assembly, so that &quot;mono&quot; is in fact the name of the
application running (and not that specified in our bundles as mono is
located somewhere else). If that's true, might it be possible to launch a
local renamed copy of the mono application as an intermediate solution in
case it takes longer to fix?

Regards,

Andreas
