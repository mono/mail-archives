<PRE>Hello, 

&gt;<i> I'm not sure if this is the best forum to ask this question - 
</I>&gt;<i> is this list intended for users of the cocoa-shrap framework 
</I>&gt;<i> or only for people who are developing the framework? If 
</I>&gt;<i> there's a more appropriate forum to ask this kindof question 
</I>&gt;<i> - I'll be happy to take it there.
</I>
I've been asking myself the same question, noticing no special users'
mailing list, as most topics recently were development-related...

There was a Wiki at cocoasharp.org once with more user-related information.
But the site has somehow &quot;changed&quot;? (domain-hijacking?!) Anyone any info?
The Mono-project.com Wiki stills points to it and I had linked to it from
the Wikipedia.
The 1.1.8.1 installer mentioned the lormyr.com Wiki which was the previous
location to my knowledge, and that site seems to be down completely... :-S

Btw what's the current status of Cocoa# monodoc? Can't a possibly unfinished
version be included in one of the next installers?

&gt;<i> In order to get this application to compile and run on my 
</I>&gt;<i> system I needed to do the following:
</I>&gt;<i> - install tiger
</I>&gt;<i> - install x11 sdk (so that libgdiplus will work)
</I>&gt;<i> - install mono
</I>&gt;<i> - write some code
</I>&gt;<i> - compile with:
</I>&gt;<i> mcs -r:itextsharp.dll -r:ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.dll 
</I>&gt;<i> -r:System.Drawing.dll -out:App.exe App.cs AppController.cs 
</I>&gt;<i> -pkg:cocoa-sharp -unsafe
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - 'macpack' with:
</I>&gt;<i> macpack -n:App -a:./App.exe -m:2 -o:. -r:App.nib 
</I>&gt;<i> -r:/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/lib/lib
</I>&gt;<i> CocoaSharpGlue.dylib
</I>&gt;<i> -r:itextsharp.dll -r:ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.dll
</I>
You don't need Tiger, I'm running fine on Panther. Rest looks okay.

&gt;<i> If I put my App.app somewhere on the web for the world to see 
</I>&gt;<i> - what will users of my application need to install in order 
</I>&gt;<i> to be able to run it? Obviously they'll need mono - but do 
</I>&gt;<i> they also need to install the
</I>&gt;<i> x11 sdk? Is there any way to bundle all the required 
</I>&gt;<i> libraries with my application.
</I>
I'm no expert here... You will definately need Mono and my understanding is
you'd need X11 - not sure if there's a differentiation between X11 und the
X11 SDK... Anyway if you wanted to bundle it you'd have to check whether (or
under which conditions) you're allowed to do so, and of course it will blow
up your download file.

Regards,

Andreas F&#228;rber
