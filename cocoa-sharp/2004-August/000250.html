<PRE>Thanks guys for the feedback.

I had indeed done a Google search to try to find some kind of resource=20=

for learning C# on the 'net, but couldn't find much that seemed very=20
clear or useful.  I find that's normally the case when looking for=20
resources to learn a programming language.

Whilst I am mostly interested in learning the basics of C# right now I=20=

do also want to learn the .NET platform.  As a Mac chap this of course=20=

means using Mono.  I therefore went to the book store with this in mind=20=

and looked at just about all the books there that dealt with C#.  I had=20=

three basic criteria in my search - price, a mention of Mono in the=20
index, and readability.

Whilst I have heard many good things about O'Reilly books the selection=20=

of them at the two local Indigo branches wasn't extensive.  I didn't=20
want to wait for an order.

In the end I opted for &quot;Teach Yourself the C#=A0Language in 21 Days&quot; by=20=

Bradley L. Jones from SAMS publishing.  It seemed to provide quite a=20
good balance between teaching C# and .NET basics.  Closer examination=20
since I got the book home has revealed that it's got a few chapters=20
that deal with Windows.Forms library, but these tend to be the later=20
chapters of the book, so I'm not worried about them being slightly=20
irrelevant.  Maybe not the best book, but it seems fairly well written=20=

and laid out, and I should be able to speed through it in a week.

I doubt that it will be a great reference title for the future, but for=20=

my purposes right now it seems fine.  When I'm feeling richer I'll=20
probably pick up one of the O'Reilly books.

Thanks again!

Steve
