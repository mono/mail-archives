<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Coming up with a proposal; my time has been few and far between this 
</I>&gt;<i> week tho; so I apologize for the delay; here's a top level view of what 
</I>&gt;<i> (imo) is needed initially; take the command line
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> mcs foo.cs -pkg:cocoa-sharp -target:bundle -bundleres:resource1 
</I>&gt;<i> -bundleres:resource2 -bundleicn:icon.file -out:Foo
</I>
I would like to address a few issues as we do this;  I would not like to
limit the bundle support to the Mac, I want to bring that to the Linux
desktop as well, some points to ponder:

	* How do we handle applications for other operating systems?

	  we could create an `CLI' directory with the CLI code, and
	  shared libraries in the others, and have scripts in the MacOS
	  and `uname` directories with copies to launch on every OS.

	* Handling more than one architecture.

	  `Linux' does not cut it when we have native shared libraries,
	  we need also the platform, so we can support more than one
	  platform with the bundle.

Am considering that we might want to have a bundle builder program,
separate from mcs at this point, as the Info.plist might contain more
information, and we might want to give the end user more support for
managing it than what mcs could offer.

Maybe a tool called bbuild?

Miguel
