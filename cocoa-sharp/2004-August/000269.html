<PRE>I see that 1.1 was released, but it is still only the basic package. 
Any idea when an installer for MonoDevelop will be available that 
includes dealing with dependencies? At least a 'recipe' of the specific 
steps required to install all of the dependencies (GTK, etc.) of the 
proper version and in the proper order would be appreciated.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> versions available and the errors being reported that I finally gave
