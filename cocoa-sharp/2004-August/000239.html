</I>	You want to add bundle loading to gnome?  Am I reading that right?

&gt;<i> 	* How do we handle applications for other operating systems?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>	The CLI code could easily go in resources as we currently have it in 
the cocoa# code; but a CLI directory could be added as well easily 
enough; I'm easy either way..

&gt;<i> 	* Handling more than one architecture.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	  `Linux' does not cut it when we have native shared libraries,
</I>&gt;<i> 	  we need also the platform, so we can support more than one
</I>&gt;<i> 	  platform with the bundle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>	So what I'm reading this is we would have
Foo.app/
	Contents/
		MacOS/
		Linux-x86/
		Linux-ppc/
		Linux-s390/
		etc.

	For os/platform specific binaries / libs?

&gt;<i> Am considering that we might want to have a bundle builder program,
</I>&gt;<i> separate from mcs at this point, as the Info.plist might contain more
</I>&gt;<i> information, and we might want to give the end user more support for
</I>&gt;<i> managing it than what mcs could offer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe a tool called bbuild?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
	This is what we were originally thinking; and if what I think you're 
saying is correct this will probably make more sense.  A simple os 
agnostic layer with a SWF/Gtk#/Cocoa# frontend to help create and 
package the bundles.
