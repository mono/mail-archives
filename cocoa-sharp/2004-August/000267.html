<PRE>Hi Guys,

I know I have no real power, but I feel its time to push a little more 
for specs on what we need do to for 0.2 and to get a release date.  I 
know that we all have other things going on so we don't have to do a 
release this month, but I would like to get a date set.

Here are things that I would like to see in a 0.2 release.

All the glue code removed
Debugging code removed, possibly made optional
GTK#:  We probably need to discuss this some to see how we want to deal.
Mostly functional Monodoc
API Docs for Cocoa# that can be used with Monodoc
Fill in some of the gaps that the generator created

I've already started investigating the API docs, so that can stay on my 
plate.  I'm also still working on the GTK# build.  I'm getting close and 
the G5 Xserve I have access to should speed this up.  Also this will 
give us a great platform to create dailies on.

Please feel free to ream me out for sending this if you can do it in a 
constructive manner.  :-)

Adhamh
