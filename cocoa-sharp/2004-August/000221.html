<PRE>Okay,

CocoaSharp should get posted anytime now.  Sorry that we slipped.  My 
bad.  :-(

In any case I wanted to get a wee bit of a roadmap going for CocoaSharp 
0.2 and Mono 1.0.1

I know that Kangaroo wants to remove the glue code for 0.2, but what 
else do we want/need to do?

For Mono 1.0.1 I think we (I) could take it easy and just build 1.0.1 
into a framework, or we can also take the opportunity to release and 
build a bunch of dependent frameworks, like Gnome, PkgConfig, etc.  
Attila and I have done a lot of work on this already, so we are close.

However, if there is going to be a Mono 1.0.2 I think I would like to 
wait for that, or maybe even Mono 1.2 to break the frameworks up.  The 
independent frameworks seem secondary to our CocoaSharp goals, and for 
some reason I don't like the idea of changing this so much so often.

Thoughts?

Adhamh
