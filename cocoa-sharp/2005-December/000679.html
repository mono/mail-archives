<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i>     1.  Please attach the patches to the message rather than posting  
</I>&gt;<i> them inline
</I>
I didn't! I read that on the list recently and I attached a .diff file 
in Thunderbird as I would attach any file. What else do I need to do for 
it to appear attached on this list?!

&gt;<i>     2.  Dont forget ChangeLog entries
</I>
Will look into that.

&gt;<i>     2.5. (Not applicable in this case) Dont forget documentation!
</I>
Do I have to write those XML files by hand? Or are they generated somehow?

I have done some additions for Window and Button, working fine so far 
(but I don't know how to omit some files from the diff? :-(). Also I 
have added a Control.Action property as an interim solution, it appears 
you are working on replacing this by events? Again, so far everything is 
working fine.
Problems are starting with TableView and related classes: Is there any 
special magic I'm missing in adding new classes? I am subclassing 
Control with base(Rect frame) [and have added ObjectiveCName and the 
static constructor and the files are being compiled okay], which appears 
to be working, but subsequently my copied-and-pasted implementation of 
dataSource, addTableColumn or reloadData (whichever is not commented 
out) throws a stack trace at runtime. My test code is the same as for 
1.1.9.2.

Andreas
