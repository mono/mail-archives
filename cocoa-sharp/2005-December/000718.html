<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I've attached a patch with the following additions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Implemented sheets for Alert, and Application.
</I>
If you look at my patch, you'll see that it too includes sheet support 
for Alert, not too nice yet though.
After all this time we're even getting conflicting patches, that's what 
I was trying to avoid...

&gt;<i> - Implemented Panel, SavePanel, and OpenPanel.
</I>

&gt;<i> - Added the ApplicationIconImage property to Application.
</I>
Can we maybe simplify this name for .NET developers? Maybe Application.Icon?

&gt;<i> - Beefed the up the documentation for the bindings I've done  
</I>&gt;<i> including cross-references and examples.
</I>

Sorry, can't comment it inline...
- I believe the AlertStyle remarks is the wrong place to document 
default values used somewhere else. This should be in the value element 
of Alert.AlertStyle. This would also apply to other properties, such as 
Panel.FloatingPanel.
- Independent of what mechanism we use for the sheet callbacks, I would 
think we should use Cocoa.Object instead of IntPtr for contextInfo.
- Regarding AlertWithMessage I was actually getting crashes because it 
didn't support null (only String.Empty) as second and third string 
argument - can you add this feature, or do you want me to?
- Regarding Application.ApplicationIconImage documentation: The 
incorrect default icon is a bug in Cocoa#/Mono and therefore should not 
be documented as is. With a different launcher the Info.plist icon is 
working just fine.
- I noticed that you too needed to import [DllImport (&quot;libobjc.dylib&quot;)] 
internal static extern IntPtr sel_getUid (string name); I would propose 
to move this functionality into a method public static IntPtr 
Native.ToSelector(string) so that we do not have to import it wherever 
we need it.
