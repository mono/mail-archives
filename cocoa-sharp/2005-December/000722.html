<PRE>kangaroo,

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Problem #1; you've changed (correctly) the signature for the  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Window  with stylemask/backingstore but havn't changed CocoaDoc.cs  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in the  samples folder; so it will not compile.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now, that is not correct: CocoaDoc is using a nib and _not_ my  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modified constructor. Have recompiled it, fixing some changes  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> required for my Control changes, and verified it's still not running.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But thanks for making me aware of the samples!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Might it be useful to include a dependency on cocoa-sharp.dll for  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the samples? That way they would get rebuilt whenever cocoa- 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sharp.dll is compiled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Window window = new Window (rect, 0, BackingStoreType.Buffered, false);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> is on line 290 of CocoaDoc.cs.
</I>
Correct, and I've updated that in the CocoaDoc patch, but it didn't 
break as 0 is a valid argument for WindowStyle whereas you said it 
didn't compile. :-) I'm just being picky, too!

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Problem #2; coding style.  We use the mono coding style  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> exclusively  and you've got that in about 95% of the case but not  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> all.  I'll point  out a few.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No, you don't ;-) - but I've changed it where I've noticed it (and  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> am keeping my opinion to myself).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did in the last email jsut further down past my signature.
</I>
I was referring to the code in SVN: Aaron's RunModal didn't and lots of 
other code doesn't as well. Like I said, where I've encountered it, I've 
changed it. See the two patches.
