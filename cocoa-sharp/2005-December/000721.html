<PRE>Hi Aaron,

&gt;&gt;<i> If you look at my patch, you'll see that it too includes sheet  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support for Alert, not too nice yet though.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> After all this time we're even getting conflicting patches, that's  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what I was trying to avoid...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah. I've been sitting on that since Dec 8. Didn't see the alert  
</I>&gt;<i> sheet in your notes or changelog.
</I>
True. It was not intended to go in yet, but I didn't think of that and 
just did an svn diff. :-$

&gt;&gt;<i> - Independent of what mechanism we use for the sheet callbacks, I  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would think we should use Cocoa.Object instead of IntPtr for  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contextInfo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That was my initial feeling but as Kangaroo pointed out, contextInfo  
</I>&gt;<i> could be ANYTHING, so IntPtr was used.
</I>
In that case what about object? That way we would free the user from 
calling that himself, which was my intent.

&gt;&gt;<i> - Regarding Application.ApplicationIconImage documentation: The  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> incorrect default icon is a bug in Cocoa#/Mono and therefore should  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not be documented as is. With a different launcher the Info.plist  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> icon is working just fine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The icon specified in the Info.plist shows up in the dock when you  
</I>&gt;<i> first launch the appliation, but calling the applicationIconImage:  
</I>&gt;<i> selector returns the default one.
</I>
Finder/Dock access the bundle you launch. However when using the 
macpack-generated launcher it is not using the correct bundle - probably 
looking at the location of mono instead, or doesn't it look for any 
because mono is a C++/Carbon app?

&gt;<i> What launcher are you referring to?  Not the one generated by macpack, 
</I>&gt;<i> right?
</I>
Right, I'm currently using Gareth Baker's launcher written in 
Objective-C, posted on this list some months ago for the previous 
version of Cocoa#. This avoids these problems but as binary code makes 
the bundle platform-dependent.

&gt;<i> Since this is the current behavior of the library I think the  
</I>&gt;<i> documentation should warn people about this and give them a  
</I>&gt;<i> workaround until it's fixed.
</I>
I'm not saying we can't use this as a way of telling people a 
workaround; I just objected to the description of the &quot;default value&quot;. 
The default value is in fact the specified bundle icon or the default 
icon if no bundle or custom bundle icon is found.
But I don't see any problem writing something like &quot;By setting this 
property you can fix the icon&quot; into the remarks section, that's what 
it's for after all. :-)

Andreas
