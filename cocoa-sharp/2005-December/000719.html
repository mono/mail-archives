Yeah. I've been sitting on that since Dec 8. Didn't see the alert  
sheet in your notes or changelog.


&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can we maybe simplify this name for .NET developers? Maybe  
</I>&gt;<i> Application.Icon?
</I>
Makes sense.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - I believe the AlertStyle remarks is the wrong place to document  
</I>&gt;<i> default values used somewhere else. This should be in the value  
</I>&gt;<i> element of Alert.AlertStyle. This would also apply to other  
</I>&gt;<i> properties, such as Panel.FloatingPanel.
</I>
True.


&gt;<i> - Independent of what mechanism we use for the sheet callbacks, I  
</I>&gt;<i> would think we should use Cocoa.Object instead of IntPtr for  
</I>&gt;<i> contextInfo.
</I>
That was my initial feeling but as Kangaroo pointed out, contextInfo  
could be ANYTHING, so IntPtr was used.


&gt;<i> - Regarding AlertWithMessage I was actually getting crashes because  
</I>&gt;<i> it didn't support null (only String.Empty) as second and third  
</I>&gt;<i> string argument - can you add this feature, or do you want me to?
</I>
I'll add tests for null.


&gt;<i> - Regarding Application.ApplicationIconImage documentation: The  
</I>&gt;<i> incorrect default icon is a bug in Cocoa#/Mono and therefore should  
</I>&gt;<i> not be documented as is. With a different launcher the Info.plist  
</I>&gt;<i> icon is working just fine.
</I>
The icon specified in the Info.plist shows up in the dock when you  
first launch the appliation, but calling the applicationIconImage:  
selector returns the default one. What launcher are you referring to?  
Not the one generated by macpack, right?

Since this is the current behavior of the library I think the  
documentation should warn people about this and give them a  
workaround until it's fixed.


&gt;<i> - I noticed that you too needed to import [DllImport  
</I>&gt;<i> (&quot;libobjc.dylib&quot;)] internal static extern IntPtr sel_getUid (string  
</I>&gt;<i> name); I would propose to move this functionality into a method  
</I>&gt;<i> public static IntPtr Native.ToSelector(string) so that we do not  
</I>&gt;<i> have to import it wherever we need it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agreed. That idea popped into my head too as I was implementing the  
sheets.
