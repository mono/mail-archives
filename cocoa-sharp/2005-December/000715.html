<PRE>Hi kangaroo,

&gt;<i> This  patch as is is _almost_ ready to get in SVN.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Problem #1; you've changed (correctly) the signature for the Window  
</I>&gt;<i> with stylemask/backingstore but havn't changed CocoaDoc.cs in the  
</I>&gt;<i> samples folder; so it will not compile.
</I>
Funny, I didn't notice any compilation problems on my system - would I 
have needed to run make clean or something else to check that? (Anyway, 
you are aware that CocoaDoc did *not* run on my system.)

&gt;<i> Problem #2; coding style.  We use the mono coding style exclusively  
</I>&gt;<i> and you've got that in about 95% of the case but not all.  I'll point  
</I>&gt;<i> out a few.
</I>
Will add the spaces; had never heard of a Mono coding style before.

&gt;<i> Problem #3; &quot;Added&quot; is fine for changelogs for new files; but for  
</I>&gt;<i> adding constructors please try to be more descriptive; ie (Added  
</I>&gt;<i> Button (Rect) for initWithFrame:) or whatever the case may be.
</I>
Didn't see any examples of that so I couldn't guess!

&gt;<i> Good job on the docs; you're doing better than me so far.
</I>
Am used to this from my job. ;-)
What about all those generated remarks elements - should I do a cleanup 
run and delete their text template? Or remove the complete element?

&gt;<i> If you can get those few things fixed up we can get this into svn asap.
</I>
Well, like I pointed out, that's the problem by now - I can't just 
resubmit that patch with modifications because I have continued work in 
my Cocoa# working copy. Will have to post a new patch once I've finished 
it, and since you didn't commit it I can't do a diff between the 
previous patch and my working copy.
Not having heard from you or someone else I have also started some work 
on Control.Action which is working for me but, I believe, have not yet 
done the same for Control.DoubleAction: an instance of a private child 
class is registered as target with the first add - making Target private 
(like ActionSelector, name changed) and adding an event Action. I 
thought Action to be more accurate than Click and fairly understandable 
for any .NET developer using code completion or readings our docs.

Andreas
