<PRE>Hi,

As I mentioned in my earlier message, I did some work on getting Tiger
MachO generation support to work.  This patch also does some other
things, which may or may not be desirable, but I found that they
generally needed to be there in order for it to work.  I have no idea if
the code works on Panther anymore.

This is a first cut, and it's a little ugly, but all three frameworks 
generate OK for me.  There are a few things I can clean up; I was a 
little sloppy in leaving extra curly braces around and those have made 
it into this patch; sorry.

It is against svn HEAD and requires the two previous patches (I think).

Anyway, other things that get changed:

* generator/header-gen/Main.cs:RemoveString() is broken, it looks like.
Perhaps we should use Regex.Replace, if we're already playing the Regex
game.  I made the comment2 regex use that, because that's the only way
it would work; RemoveString didn't remove all of the matched text.

* we now look for enums inside of @interface declarations, so there are
a _lot_ more enums getting generated.  I had to manually override a few 
of them because of some constants - then I looked and saw how some of 
the previous enums had been fixed with addins; I didn't think of doing 
it that way, and can go back and fix that.

* unsigned int[] is handled as unsigned int * when parsed from header files

* typedefs are not added for void types, because things were breaking badly

* we no longer generate noname enums - we weren't using them within the 
project, and they proved to be somewhat problematic.  Are these used 
externally?  If so, we'll have to put them back.

There's more, most likely; take a look.  As I said, it's a bit rough, 
but it should be enough to get a reasonable release out there.

The patch can be found here:
