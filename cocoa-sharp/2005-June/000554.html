</I>&gt;<i> As I mentioned in my earlier message, I did some work on getting Tiger

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a first cut, and it's a little ugly, but all three

</I>&gt;<i> those have made it into this patch; sorry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is against svn HEAD and requires the two previous patches (I  
</I>&gt;<i> think).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, other things that get changed:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * generator/header-gen/Main.cs:RemoveString() is broken, it looks  
</I>&gt;<i> like.
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps we should use Regex.Replace, if we're already playing the  
</I>&gt;<i> Regex
</I>&gt;<i> game.  I made the comment2 regex use that, because that's the only way
</I>&gt;<i> it would work; RemoveString didn't remove all of the matched text.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * we now look for enums inside of @interface declarations, so there  
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> a _lot_ more enums getting generated.  I had to manually override a  
</I>&gt;<i> few of them because of some constants - then I looked and saw how  
</I>&gt;<i> some of the previous enums had been fixed with addins; I didn't  
</I>&gt;<i> think of doing it that way, and can go back and fix that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * unsigned int[] is handled as unsigned int * when parsed from  
</I>&gt;<i> header files
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * typedefs are not added for void types, because things were  
</I>&gt;<i> breaking badly
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * we no longer generate noname enums - we weren't using them within  
</I>&gt;<i> the project, and they proved to be somewhat problematic.  Are these  
</I>&gt;<i> used externally?  If so, we'll have to put them back.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's more, most likely; take a look.  As I said, it's a bit  
</I>&gt;<i> rough, but it should be enough to get a reasonable release out there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The patch can be found here:
