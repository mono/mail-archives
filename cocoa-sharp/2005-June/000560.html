&gt;<i> Ok I got to this so comments:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Why all the method overrides?
</I>
Conflicts, as I recall.  ObjC can have methods which are both static and 
instance-bound with the same names.  I had to override a few in order 
for the generated code to be entirely correct (i.e., compile).

&gt;<i> 2) all of the custom enums you have in that say generated; are they  
</I>&gt;<i> generated or hand made; if they're generated why would we add them to  
</I>&gt;<i> svn?
</I>
They were generated with hand modifications (constants that existed 
elsewhere in #defines, etc.)  I didn't think of the .addin trick that I 
then saw in a few other places (e.g. to handle UINT_MAX).  I can update 
the custom enums that I'd just overrided so they'll just work that way. 
  That is something I'd planned to do.

&gt;<i> 3) could you please resend without the { } and whitespace changes?
</I>
Sure. I will try to put that together tonight or tomorrow; hopefully 
that can be in the same patch as the cleanups for #2.

&gt;<i> 4) why :
</I>&gt;<i> -            Type.AddTypedef 
</I>&gt;<i> (&quot;NSApplicationDelegateReply&quot;,Type.FromDecl(&quot;int&quot;));
</I>&gt;<i> -            Type.AddTypedef 
</I>&gt;<i> (&quot;NSRequestUserAttentionType&quot;,Type.FromDecl(&quot;int&quot;));
</I>
Ugh... my notes on that are somewhat unclear.  Likely it broke the 
compile; I'll try to go back over the code and figure out exactly why.

&gt;<i> 5) disabling noname enums I'm ok with; as long as they reference  
</I>&gt;<i> methods that call them are fixed up
</I>
I assume you mean &quot;the reference methods&quot; - after running the generator 
with them turned off and searching src/*, I didn't see anything 
referencing them, unless anyone's external code does, we should be okay...

&gt;<i> 6) Please dont commit mapping.xml changes unless they're required for  
</I>&gt;<i> some reason
</I>
I'm not sure if this is a bug or something to that effect, but if you 
use the mapping.xml that's currently in SVN head, the Foundation etc 
doesn't compile; if you then run the generator again (with the changes 
to mapping.xml that the generator has saved) everything compiles OK.

I'm not sure exactly why this happens, but it is easy to reproduce (just 
drop in an old mapping.xml and run the generator), so if it's a concern, 
give it a shot. As it consists of the majority of the size of the diff, 
I wouldn't have submitted it as a patch if it wasn't broken for me.

&gt;<i> Other than that this all looks ok; so if we can clean up / address  
</I>&gt;<i> those few things we can get that commited this week and roll a 0.3  
</I>&gt;<i> for tiger ppl
</I>
Great.  I have a few more things I'm working on, too; they're not really 
ready for prime time, but I would like to see them added to the tree 
once they are.

In fact, it might be worthwhile to see if there's any interest. They're 
very useful for what I'd like to use the generator/cocoa-sharp glue for...

* a new type of object I've called NSObjectSurrogate, which wraps 
objects that do not subclass NSObject (like, say, Hashtable, for example)
* cleanup/support for allowing the REGISTER_ALL_METHODS define to be 
turned on in Apple.Foundation.BridgeHelper, so you can call 
methods/get/set properties on System.* classes without needing to modify 
them)
* support for exporting C# object properties as objc methods

... so you can easily manipulate objects that don't subclass NSObject 
after they're passed into ObjC code.  We have a custom ObjC-written 
framework which we would like (rather transparently) to be able to 
interact with .NET objects.
