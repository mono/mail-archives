<PRE>Hi,

I have a few patches for the cocoa-sharp generator to contribute.  We're
thinking of using the generator in conjunction with a custom framework to
bring the functionality of that framework to .NET/mono code.  These are
two patches that make doing so a bit easier.

First, given the state of the generator on 10.4, this patch:

<A HREF="http://www.strangecargo.org/~bdb/cocoa-sharp/001-framework-output.patch">http://www.strangecargo.org/~bdb/cocoa-sharp/001-framework-output.patch</A>

...causes the &lt;output&gt; parameter in generator.xml to work.  I have the
generator working enough on Tiger to parse MachO libraries but it still
has some problems writing out code (probably related to types; I'm working
on it.)

Second,

<A HREF="http://www.strangecargo.org/~bdb/cocoa-sharp/002-frameworkdir.patch">http://www.strangecargo.org/~bdb/cocoa-sharp/002-frameworkdir.patch</A>

...allows you to specify custom directories to look for MachO files from
the generator command line, instead of the defaults.  Use the
-frameworkdir: option.

These patches are against HEAD; the svn revision numbers are wrong because
they're against svk on my laptop.

I'm working on getting the generator working under Tiger, but still having
some trouble.  I had thought it was somewhat ready, but in running it
again, it looks like it's still broken.  I don't have the patch handy at
the moment, but I'll try to at least get a work-in-progress patch posted
soon.

Is anyone from the list at WWDC this week?  If so, care to grab some lunch
on Friday?  If there's any interest, send me an email privately; I'd be
happy to coordinate.

Thanks!

-Bryan
