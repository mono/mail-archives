<PRE>Hi,

I am very interested in Cocoa-Sharp since I am a Java programmer  
learning C# and a big Mac fan.

Unfortunately there is very littIe documentation available; I haven't  
been able to find a working example
(on my system I did successfully build Hello.exe but Mono crashed  
when I try to run it).

I did look at the source tree via the web interface but did not find  
a large collection of C# classes mapping NS classes.

I am interested to know how the bridge works. Theoretically you could  
achieve a bridge in several ways:

(1) Create a C# class for every Cocoa class and duplicate all of its  
fields and methods in C# code.
(2) As above but make calls via unsafe code to Objectve C code  
wrappers which wrap each Cocoa class.

There are probably others that I haven't thought of.

But in any case presumably there are issues with the different nature  
of the runtime environments e.g. memory management (i.e. GC in C# vs  
reference counting in Cocoa), reflection, etc.

Would anyone care to enlighten those newcomers such as myself?


Thanks in advance,

Tim Mowlem
