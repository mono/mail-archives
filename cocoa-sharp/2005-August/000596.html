<PRE>Dear Ted,

&gt;<i>where did you even get a Hello.exe using Cocoa#
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>There is no Hello.exe available, I was referring to Tim's example. You 
have to compile it yourself using the source code that suits your needs.

&gt;<i>i am looking and not finding any example code or API docs :9
</I>&gt;<i>can you copy me a list of all useful cocoa# resources you have?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I'm actually relatively new to Cocoa# myself. The one and only Cocoa# 
resource I know and could find was:
<A HREF="http://www.cocoasharp.org/cocoaSharp/default.aspx/CocoaSharp/CocoaSharp.html">http://www.cocoasharp.org/cocoaSharp/default.aspx/CocoaSharp/CocoaSharp.html</A>
It's not pretty and it's not much but we can all help extend the 
information once we've found out!
The Cocoa Sharp Examples topic had a working link to the example.tgz 
archive when I last used it... The Makefile was outdated but using the 
command sequence detailed on that page it worked. I used the Cocoa Sharp 
Browser example as a starting point because I am writing my GUI in C#. 
For a simple Hello World app, it's easiest to create a .nib file (menu 
and window) in Interface Builder (choose Cocoa &gt; Application), then 
write a C# file in TextEdit (or XCode) with a static Main method that 
loads it as in Thomas Richon's post - where MyNib.nib would be the name 
of your .nib file. Example:
using Apple.AppKit;
class YourClass {
    static void Main() {
       Application.Init();
       Application.LoadNib(&quot;your.nib&quot;);
       Application.Run();
    }
}
Compile it with mcs as on the examples page, then use macpack to create 
a .app bundle, which you can execute by doubleclicking on it.

There are some issues with this approach but you don't need to worry 
about them for Hello World. :-) See the archive for possible 
workarounds, Gareth Baker sent me some helpful code.

HTH,
Andreas
