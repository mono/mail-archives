<PRE>Hello, I will ask maybe a pretty dumb question, but your official site
is quite basic and I haven't been able to figure anything sensible out
from it, since I am quite new to C# and mac programing in general

I have a Mac Os X 10.5 and XCode 3, but because of school, I have to
develop basic C# application (basic means console-based, never
windows-based). I would like to do it in OS X somehow.

I installed Mono, but I don't like the way the editor behaves - it
does not behave as native mac application (for example, the menu bar
is not on top of the screen and so on).

So I wondered, if it's possible to use Mono/C# for basic console
applications in XCode (or, for example, in TextMate) - or in any other
&quot;native&quot; looking application? I have not really been able to make
anything from the official site, and on google dev site there is
nothing meaningful too...
