<PRE>Jason,

	Its appreciated that you've done this for the community.  As you may 
or may not know; the cocoa# &quot;team&quot; (specifically adhamh) builds the 
Mono packages for the official ximian/novell distributions as well.  It 
has been a choice of ours (to date) to not include cocoa# due to the 
fact that our release schedules dont sync (ie; mono 1.0 out before 
cocoa# 0.1; cocoa# 0.2 will be out before mono 1.2).  That being said; 
I'm sure many people will find use for your installer and its 
appreciated.

	All that being said; your email has introduced me to 2 new names that 
I dont recognize on this mailing list so I'm going to address a couple 
specific things in mono-osx / cocoa# land:

#1:  If you're planning on working on MonoDevelop; please take a look 
at the buildGTKSharp.sh script that adhamh has been toiling on and I've 
contributed to.  Please use that as a basis for any building / 
packaging of MD that you may do.

#2 And of more interest to most people subscribed to this list; cocoa# 
0.2 is well underway with the majority of our technical goals met.  We 
now do binary parsing of MachO binaries to derive class/selectors 
combined with header parsing to beef up information.  Even more than 
that; I developed a (very cool if I may say so myself) glueless way of 
binding the runtime generically that urs and I hooked up ~2 weeks ago.  
As a result 0.2 will go down to only 1 supporting dylib (0.3 should 
have 0 dylibs; yay for no supporting native libs).
