I must apologize for this (being the one to make this change).

I modified monodocer to sort the &lt;Member/&gt; nodes (based on @MemberName,
number of parameters, return type, etc.), as originally monodocer
generated output in System.Reflection order, which is (1) completely
unspecified, and (2) can change on the whim of Reflection/mcs/etc.

I figured that sorting the output would *reduce* the amount of _future_
ordering changes.

It also helps with making it easier to find duplicated members, as
they'll be next to each other.  (I've found numerous instances of &quot;bad&quot;
duplicate member checking in monodocer -- some fixed only 2 weeks ago --
where the same member would be present multiple times within an XML
file.  I found it easier to see these duplicated nodes when they were
sorted next to each other.)

I like, depending on how far you go. :-)

My own personal plan at the moment is to write an umbrella command-line
program 'mdoc' to better associate the current programs.

For example:
  Old:                  New:
  ---                   ---
  mdassembler           mdoc assemble
  monodocs2html	        mdoc export-html
  monodocs2slashdoc     mdoc export-slashdoc
  mdnormalizer          mdoc normalize
  monodocer             mdoc update
  mdvalidater           mdoc validate
  mod                   mdoc view

I wouldn't remove the old programs, but the idea is that this would
allow a &quot;naming&quot; framework for new programs that wouldn't continually
&quot;pollute&quot; $PATH.  It would also bring some mental consistency; the name
&quot;monodocer&quot; doesn't really make it easily associated with any of the
other apps as seen through e.g. shell tab completion. :-)

I also want to update the command-line arguments of these apps to
increase consistency, e.g. -o vs. -dest or -path, etc.

So my fear is that your integrated WYSIWYG editor would obsolete this
idea.

I like the idea of a WYSIWYG editor, but I don't want to lose the
ability to do separate command-line updates.  I also want to avoid code
duplication.  (For example, `mdoc' will simply execute the existing
$prefix/lib/monodoc/*.exe programs, NOT re-implement them.)

Otherwise, I love the idea. :-)
