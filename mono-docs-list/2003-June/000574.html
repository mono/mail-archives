Okay, now we have those.  Updating all of the ECMA docs took a while to 
make sure no information was being lost as I ran all of the xml files 
through a stylesheet.  I realize now that committing changes for the 
whole monodoc/class directory was probably not a good idea...

Parameter nodes now have a RefType attribute if the parameter is by 
referece which is either &quot;ref&quot; or &quot;out.&quot;

Delegates have Parameters and ReturnValue nodes at their top-level, 
which have the same format as those in member nodes.

I realize now that Events should have their delegate type stored in the 
ECMA docs as well... but I leave this for another time.

I'll need to add these new attributes/nodes to whatever programs there 
are to generate ECMA outlines and updates.

I'll also need to give to GTK# people what I used to update the docs.

I fixed a few more mono-ecma stylesheet bugs.

And, I added a &quot;Mono Implementation Notes&quot; section at the top of type 
and member pages (and summaries in the type and member listings):
	mono-ecma.xsl now has a call to an extension function to get this 
information at runtime
	I had to fix my extension object implementation in System.XML.dll to 
get this to work, otherwise it would randomly generate 
NullReferenceExceptions.
	If the assembly of the type is available to MonoDoc, it loads the 
assembly.  If the type doesn't exist, or if it has MonoTODO attributes, 
or if its members have MonoTODO attributes, it presents that information 
on the documentation page.
	Maybe this should be done ahead of time, or not at all.
	It might be a good way to identify what parts of Mono still need work.

Hopefully this is wrapping up my monodoc contributions. :)
