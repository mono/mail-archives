I've now checked in the code. Sorry it took so long. Please feel free to
hack out bits that don't look so great. It works, but I'm not at all
happy with my URL handling, (see below).

&gt;<i> If you use &quot;xhtml:&quot; in the links you generate, you will need to be able
</I>&gt;<i> to tell the various help sources appart, or as you noticed, the
</I>&gt;<i> resolution will fail.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The trick I used in the old ecma-provider, was to use the
</I>&gt;<i> HelpSource.SourceID, and the urls look like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	source-id:N:ecma:....
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just prefix every one of your links with &quot;source-id:NNN&quot;, and things
</I>&gt;<i> will work as they should.  The trick is that you will need to do some
</I>&gt;<i> XPath processing at runtime and replace the nodes.
</I>
I read this a few times, thought I'd got it figured, tweaked my code a
bit, reread this a few more times, utterly confused myself, and now I'm
not sure what The Right Thing to do is, in terms of correctly loading
from the right help source. Maybe it's really obvious, but I just don't
100% understand how the url lookup system maps to the help source
system?

&gt;<i> It looks fine.  We should integrate these into a makefile in the Mono
</I>&gt;<i> tutorial tree, so I can run that before making a Monodoc release. 
</I>
I think the only thing stopping this is that the assembler never gets
installed anywhere? Because of that, it's tricky to write a generic
makefile... Maybe we should rename it monodoc-assembler and put a shell
wrapper script in the install path? I could write a patch for the
monkeyguide makefile trivially then...

&gt;<i> And now is a good time for me to go and review the other pending
</I>&gt;<i> Monodoc patch to get the About box in place.
</I>
I also committed a tiny tweak to handle relative anchors; hope you don't
mind!

Regards,

Lee.
