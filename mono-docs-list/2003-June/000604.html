<PRE>Hello!

&gt;<i> If my previous 12% speed improvement patch wasn't enough for you, you
</I>&gt;<i> are in good company ;-), it was not enough for me either. So I went in
</I>&gt;<i> and ripped out all the XPath and XmlDocument stuff from the guts of
</I>&gt;<i> ecma-provider and replaced it with cool, clean XmlTextReader.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a result, I was able to half both the amount of time it takes to
</I>&gt;<i> assemble the class libraries and the amount of memory that the assembler
</I>&gt;<i> takes up.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> May I commit?
</I>
Ok, this one am going to have to review more carefully than the previous
one.  Although it might give us a big performance boost, in general, I
do not like to use the XmlTextReader interface, as it is more complex,
but I will look at this on the airplane on sunday.

My concern is: the assembler is not run very frequently, but we need to
maintain it;  So in this particular case, we should optimize for
maintenance, and not for speed.

Miguel
