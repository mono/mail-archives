:<i>    I guess, by now, you may have gone through a lot of reading in
</I>:<i>WebControls. Since, it may become a hurdle for me in programming, I
</I>would :prefer you to start from those classes that are complete. I have
about a :total of 90 classes, structs, enums and interfaces completed.
Best would be :choose any one of them and start. You may face problems
with some of the :internal / private method-calls / members. Incase the
names are not self :explanatory, you can always ask me.

Ok, I will document private (and protected) members as well as public.

I am filling completed files in System.Web.UI.WebControls with
reasonably concise &lt;remarks&gt; and &lt;summary&gt; tags.  I would like to
provide more extended documentation as well.  For now I plan to write a
plain-text (tagless) page for each file I document with examples and
explanations.  Should I do this?  Also, any standards I should follow
beyond those mentioned in the EMCA section?

Joe
