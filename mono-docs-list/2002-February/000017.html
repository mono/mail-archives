Adam,

This is going to be considerably more brief than I wanted, as I just 
discovered that I have to take an emergency business trip, and my flight's 
in a couple of hours. ;-)

My current thinking is a little bit different than what's stated in the 
skeleton document on the website.  After looking things over, I think it'd 
be a good idea for the mono XML to be exactly what csc /doc generates, with 
the addition of a 'lang' or 'locale' attribute on the root element, which 
would use ISO codes to specify region/language.

This way, we can use and contribute to emerging open-source documentation 
frameworks like NDOC rather than rolling our own.  Since the overall goal 
of Mono is to promote code reuse, we might as well eat our own dogfood. ;-)

More later.
