<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> If this works, it would mean that the HTML printed out could potentially
</I>&gt;<i> look different that what the user is seeing (if monodoc is using the
</I>&gt;<i> gecko engine), but I personally don't think it is a big deal. My other
</I>Well, you have to check that because it could be barely readable
without css (just disable the use of css in BuildHtml as an easy hack
to see the results). The problem is that AFAIK the GtkHTML is/would be
deprecated (and keeped only for the systems that don't have
gecko-sharp).

&gt;<i> option is to look into the Mozilla API and try to P/invoke something,
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not totally opposed to this but I have not been able to find any
</I>&gt;<i> good source of info on the gecko API.
</I>There is a guy (Michael Hutchinson) in the Summer of Code which has
implemented a glue layer that lets you call javascript functions in
mozilla from c#. He uses that for the Asp.net editor he is working on.
If we apply that to monodoc browser, maybe it would be possible to use
javascript for printing. However, I really dont know if javascript
lets you printing, :-)

By the way, Miguel, can I enable the hack of Michael to Monodoc? it
could let us repare the selectAll/copy/paste thing but I dont want to
try it out until I'm sure it could go with monodoc (it could also
allow rafael to work on the printing in a more sane way).

Mario
