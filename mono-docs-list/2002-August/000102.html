&gt;<i> Hello guys,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    I have been looking at the current framework we have for
</I>&gt;<i> documentation checked into CVS, and I think I would like to make a few
</I>&gt;<i> changes to the way documentation works.  Here are my thoughts:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	1. Assemblies should be each documented on its own, we should
</I>&gt;<i> 	   not have a full merged set of documented.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	   This way, we can use the same tools to document Gtk# and
</I>&gt;<i> 	   Qt#.  
</I>
I am not sure what you mean here.  Qt# will use the mono documentation tools as soon as they are
ready.  We will write a script to put our autogenerated comments into the external mono.xml files.
 I believe Rachel is planning to do the same, so I don't forsee any problems here.
 
&gt;<i> 	2. The merged &quot;view&quot; of all the documents should be taken care
</I>&gt;<i> 	   at documentation install time, or by the GUI by importing
</I>&gt;<i> 	   multiple documentation sources.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     I do not know where the templates we have right now came from: from
</I>&gt;<i> our assemblies or from the Microsoft assemblies.   The templates have a
</I>&gt;<i> number of problems: they are generated files, and hence, they are
</I>&gt;<i> subject to be overwritten in the future.
</I>
The templates, aka stub xml files are generated by docstub.  It uses reflection to populate the
stub files.  The backend was taken from NDoc, but it requires no GUI driver.
 
&gt;<i>     What I would like for the &quot;editing&quot; tool, is a way to extract our
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;target&quot; documentation skeleton from the MS assemblies (we can probably
</I>&gt;<i> use CorCompare to do this), but this skeleton would not contain any
</I>&gt;<i> documentation, it would only be the skeleton.  
</I>
This is what docstub does.  I think it should be pretty much feature complete since we use the
NDoc reflection stuff.
 
&gt;<i>     The editing tool could then show which nodes are missing, and which
</I>&gt;<i> nodes have content.  We would only save actual content to our
</I>&gt;<i> documentation files, never stubs or pre-generated output.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Comments?
</I>&gt;<i> Miguel.
</I>
Ahh, I think I see what you mean.  You want to incorporate docstub more fully into the GUI... 
This way when someone decides to write the documentation for a specific class the stubbing will be
done at editing time.  I see the advantages of this in terms of file I/O and it shouldn't be more
difficult than what I was planning.  I will be home tomorrow.  I'll try to look at this then.

Adam
