<PRE>Hello Everyone,

I've begun work on MonoDoc GUI that will interface with the docstub tool and 
allow developers to edit documentation in a nice graphical manner.  You can 
see the preliminary screenshot here:

I'll be leaving for france tomorrow, but I plan on completing this tool while 
abroad.  Mono has come quite far since it's inception, but one of the areas 
where we are severly lacking is proper API documentation.  Hopefully, this 
tool will help to remedy that situation.  Along with a nice ASP.NET editor 
and Raul's Gtk# editor, I hope that this will spur people to actually edit 
the xml ;-)

There are some other areas where we need progress:

1.  Eventually, we'll need a nice xslt script to turn the xml into nice 
formatted html documentation.  I hope the xslt gurus among us will help us 
out and make a nice documentation style... :-)

2.  The docstub tool needs to be extended to regenerate documentation upon 
changes to the API _without_ overwriting the hand edited xml.  John Barnette 
was working on this, but unfortunately he seems to have disappeared.  Where 
are you John??!

3.  I am going to try hard to separate the frontend of my GUI from the backend 
to allow Raul and others to make a tool with Gtk#

4.  And of course any ambitious folk who are bored or actually like to hand 
edit xml can start documenting until the GUI tools are in place.

Cheers,

Adam
