<PRE>Greetings!

So, I was talking to a partner of mine on MonoBrasil (Alexandre
Marcondes), who is an active member on the development of our Mono Basic
compiler. 

We would appreciate instructions on how to add some documentation on
MonoDoc quite similar to C#'s Language Specification, but about our
MonoBasic implementation. 

I'll copy here the text of our conversation at #mono today. 

We would be very happy if anyone could correct/point us what to do to
start with it. 

****

(10:24:57) MonoNoSaint: Hey guys, I think you have seen my conversation
with AlexMBas here, I guess.  So, what should we need/do to put into
MonoDoc some documentation about MonoBasic?
(10:27:33) MonoNoSaint: From what I can see on MonoDoc there are two
specific titles on C#: the Language Specification and the Compiler Error
Reference. Basically we could follow the same structure we see there, I
guess... am I right?
(10:30:00) AlexMBas: yes ...
(10:30:38) AlexMBas: I was thinking of putting the MonoBASIC language
specification first
(10:31:22) AlexMBas: the monobasic compiler error references are not
done yet ... but the syntax is almost all covered by the compiler
(10:32:46) MonoNoSaint: I see...  I could write the text for the
Specification. 
(10:33:32) MonoNoSaint: Is MonoBasic standardized the ECMA? I thought
just  C# was... 
(10:33:36) MonoNoSaint: *by the*
(10:34:55) AlexMBas: unfortunately just C# was
(10:35:10) MonoNoSaint: I thought so... 
(10:35:14) AlexMBas: we would do something like the ECMA specification
(10:35:16) MonoNoSaint: AlexMBas: So... do you already have a draft
about this?
(10:35:28) AlexMBas: to facilitate the access to the developers
(10:35:30) AlexMBas: not yet
(10:35:34) MonoNoSaint: Yep
(10:35:46) AlexMBas: the monoBASIC team will help on this
(10:36:02) MonoNoSaint: We could work together so. 
(10:36:35) AlexMBas: I was responsible of findind out how to add our
docs to MonoDoc ...
(10:36:43) MonoNoSaint: They could write the documentation in
Portuguese, which they feel must comfortable. Then I could translate it
to English... 
(10:37:09) AlexMBas: MonoNoSain1, yes, we could do that ... isn't there
any problem ?
(10:37:25) MonoNoSaint: of course not, perfect to me. 
(10:37:28) MonoNoSaint: :)
(10:37:47) AlexMBas: I had thought on writing directly in english, but
if the translation team could do this &quot;reverse work&quot;  it would be great
(10:38:38) MonoNoSaint: We could start defining the topics to put there,
taking the C# Language Specification as a model. 
(10:39:25) MonoNoSaint: So, all I imagine is necessary is ask here for
someone to insert the nodes on the treeview (once we have the topics) on
the left of MonoDoc. 
(10:40:04) MonoNoSaint: There is a &quot;Upload Contributions&quot; on the File
menu. Then all I guess is necessary is to add the text and upload it. 
(10:40:46) MonoNoSaint: I'll copy this conversation of ours and post
into the MonoDoc list, I sign it
(10:40:47) AlexMBas: hey guys, who should me and MonoNoSain1 talk to in
order to add a documentation tree to MonoDoc ?
(10:40:57) MonoNoSaint: What do you think?
(10:41:08) AlexMBas: MonoNoSain1, perfect for me
(10:41:42) MonoNoSaint: Settled then. I'll copy it and ask for help.
(10:43:22) MonoNoSaint: AlexMBas: Leave this with me so, I'll send a
mail to them and CC it to you. 
(10:43:39) MonoNoSaint: As soon as I get the answer we talk again. OK?
(10:47:49) AlexMBas: ok MonoNoSain1 
(10:48:07) MonoNoSaint: Perfect so. 

****

So this is it. All your help will be very much appreciated. 

Thanks in advance!
