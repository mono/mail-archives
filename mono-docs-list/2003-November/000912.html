<PRE>-----
NUnit
-----

a) In &quot;Introduction&quot;, there is a mixture of capitalizations in .Net vs
.NET

b) In &quot;Introduction&quot;, a comma should be added after &quot;2.0&quot;

c) In &quot;Install&quot;, the use of a comma before therefore is awkward; perhaps
it sound better without the comma or making it two sentences.

d) Should the section title &quot;Commandline options&quot; be &quot;Command line
options&quot;? It's two separate words in the paragraphs that follows it.
Just being consistent here :)

d) Under &quot;Forms Interface&quot;, the third sentence is a run-on sentence.

e) Under &quot;Forms Interface,&quot; the fourth sentence has a &quot;5&quot;. It would be
better to change that to &quot;five&quot; since the first sentence already has it
like that, and it a bit more formal in the context.

f) In &quot;Forms Interface&quot;, a colon needs to be added at the end of:
&quot;The following will start the forms interface with the assembly:
nunit.tests.dll&quot;

g) Chapter 6 has mailto: links for &quot;Credits&quot; while all of the names
under previous (Chapter 5, 4, etc) sections do not.

-----
NGen
-----

a) No mailto: tag for the name in &quot;Credits&quot; (I'll no longer mention this
again, as it's all over :) )

----
Mono Documentation Browser
----

a) There is what I think is an unnecessary &lt;br&gt; after &quot;The command is
called mod,&quot;

----
Using the Mono Debugger
----

It says, under &quot;Install&quot;, that there have bene no releases of the
debugger, but yet, from go-mono.com, &quot;Jan, 19th, 2003: Mono Debugger
released.&quot; :)

Also, the treeview of the &quot;Using the Mono Debugger&quot; section has
&quot;debugger&quot; instead of &quot;Debugger&quot;
