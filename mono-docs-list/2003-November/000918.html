Please note that I have not used the cygwin environment, so I will not
be able to assist with that.  I am just a &quot;lurker&quot; on these lists and it
seems the list you are after is one door down - &quot;mono-list&quot; - this is
&quot;mono-docs-list&quot;, which while the documentation might be lacking (it
obviously is - everything seems to be in a state of flux at the moment),
mono-list may be able to provide solutions to your problems.

Hope that this helps (doubt it).
