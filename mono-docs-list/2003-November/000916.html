I am trying to install mono (latest version), and I am having some =
trouble.  Cygin complains that I don't have &quot;libiconv&quot; package =
installed.  I figured out how to install that, now it complains that cvs =
command is not found.  I will also have to say that the reliance on =
Cywin is a huge one, and the Cygwin install is one of the most painful =
installs I have made in quite some time.  I must have had to restart =
this install 20-30 times to get everything, and it appears that I am not =
even close to getting it all in there.

Two words -- painful and ugly.  Lose the Cygwin dependancy and your =
product might have a hope of being something one day.  I am still trying =
to see if it is worthwhile, but you can see what my initial thoughts are =
going to be.  Initial impressions are the most meaniful.
