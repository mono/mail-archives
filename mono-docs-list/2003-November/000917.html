I will have to say -- I usually don't give up easily, but I am finally =
done with this project.  I have never been more frustrated in my life =
trying to get something to work as I have with the mono install.

To begin with, all of help that I have run across require Cygwin to =
compile it, which is a nightmare in itself.  After about 30 tries trying =
to get this installed, I think I might have it done, but I have no way =
to tell.  The only error message I get is &quot;unable to build executables&quot;. =
 This morning I tried re-installing cygwin (everything this time), and I =
get Unknown host anoncvs.go-mono.com:2401/mono.

I have stumbled upon the Bugzilla web page for notes that say what is =
broken and I am headed down that path.  Keep in mind that the =
instructions on your web page are littered with broken links and vague =
instructions.  There also seem to lots of references to terms that I am =
not familiar with, seeing that I have not yet done any development in =
c#, so any help that you could assist with would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

-Kevin
