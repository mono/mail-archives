<PRE>Hello Kevin,

&gt;<i> I will have to say -- I usually don't give up easily, but I am finally
</I>&gt;<i> done with this project.  I have never been more frustrated in my life
</I>&gt;<i> trying to get something to work as I have with the mono install.
</I>
Am sorry to hear that.

We recommend people to use the released binary packages to get a feel of
Mono.  We release ready-to-run packages for Windows and various Linux
flavors and various architecture flavors as well.

&gt;<i> To begin with, all of help that I have run across require Cygwin to
</I>&gt;<i> compile it, which is a nightmare in itself.  After about 30 tries
</I>&gt;<i> trying to get this installed, I think I might have it done, but I have
</I>&gt;<i> no way to tell.  The only error message I get is &quot;unable to build
</I>&gt;<i> executables&quot;.  This morning I tried re-installing cygwin (everything
</I>&gt;<i> this time), and I get Unknown host anoncvs.go-mono.com:2401/mono.
</I>
Yes, the Cygwin dependency is a pain because there is no such thing as a
point release, it is an always-changing, always moving target.  So
depending on the day you install you might have more luck than other
days.

&gt;<i> I have stumbled upon the Bugzilla web page for notes that say what is
</I>&gt;<i> broken and I am headed down that path.  Keep in mind that the
</I>&gt;<i> instructions on your web page are littered with broken links and vague
</I>&gt;<i> instructions.  There also seem to lots of references to terms that I
</I>&gt;<i> am not familiar with, seeing that I have not yet done any development
</I>&gt;<i> in c#, so any help that you could assist with would be greatly
</I>&gt;<i> appreciated.
</I>
If you could point to the errors you have found, that would be great at
least to help others coming in.   

Miguel
