<PRE>
I've been looking lately at the mono documentation on the mono website and
even when the msdn documentation is, most of the time, enough for mono
users, I think we should have our own documentation build since many users
see this lack of documentation as a reason to avoid using mono and keep
themselves &quot;safe&quot; in the microsoft version of the platform.

I would really like to contribute to documentation since this is one of the
most important points in a project to be succesful but, how do we get
started? I can see there are a lot of methods and classes not documented,
classes and methods that any .Net user expect to be documented (read:
anything below System.*) and as I said before, most would tell me that we
should just go to msdn but then again, I feel we should really have our
documentation so it could be shipped with the distribution of the mono
platform.

Why there's so much lack of documentation? Is there some copyright issue on
the Microsoft documentation that denies users to use that as a base to build
documentation? I ask this because i believe many of their documentation
could be used to build the mono documentation, maybe not copying and pasting
but at least taking the examples and following mono documentation
guidelines.

Any place to start? I've read the guidelines but could not find anything
about that.

Thanks.
