<PRE>Hello!

&gt;<i> Currently we need:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Threading
</I>
In this particular chapter, I think a few things can be said which are
outside the scope of the regular .NET threading:

	* Gtk-issues with threads (we can copy paste some of this from
	  a google search on this, there are a couple of posts from
	  Owen on this subject).

	* How to make all your GUI code run in one thread, and how to
	  wake-up/notify the main thread from a separate thread.  There
	  are two ways:

		* ThreadNotify, which calls a delegate on the main
		  thread.

		* The Idle add trick (this used to be broken, but seems
	  	  fixed now).

&gt;<i> - Remoting (!)
</I>
My only comment here is that we can start by &quot;describing&quot; the inner
working of the samples provided by Lluis on the mailing list as a
crash-course, and then digging deeper into it.

&gt;<i> - Someone to write about WebServices:
</I>&gt;<i> Felix planned to help here, but I have not seen him for a long time
</I>&gt;<i> here, but maybe he can tell if he is working on it.
</I>
We still do not have a lot of WebServices support, so I think we can put
this section on hold until we get things moving.

&gt;<i> - ASP.NET needs much work:
</I>&gt;<i> Each control should be described in detail with some text and at least
</I>&gt;<i> one example
</I>
Do we have a nice table of contents here?  Maybe we should produce one
outline first.

Miguel
