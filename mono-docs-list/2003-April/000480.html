<PRE>Hello,

   Our Help browser was designed to be extensible.  My focus so far has
been on making the help browser usable for browsing our ECMA-based
documentation, but we will need more providers in the future.  For
example one to handle the simpler compiler generated help files, one for
HTML documents, and one for the C# language spec.

   Anyways, today I checked in some more notes into monodoc/browser in
the file NOTES that explains how a provider works, and I also wrote a
simple provider as a reference example.

   The simple provider is only used to demostrate how it can be used,
and it is very simple.  The provider &quot;packages&quot; up a directory and any
of its children directories for being browsed.  It creates a node for
each directory, and children nodes for files.

   To &quot;compile&quot; a set of files and directories, do:

	mono assembler.exe --out test --simple /cvs/mono/doc

   That will traverse &quot;/cvs/mono/doc&quot; and store all the files in the
couple `test.tree' and `test.zip'.   Now, you have to put those two
files in your sources directory, together with a test.sources file, the
contents of test.sources should be:

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;monodoc&gt;
  &lt;source provider=&quot;simple&quot; basefile=&quot;test&quot; path=&quot;various&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/monodoc&gt;

    That will attach your experiment to the &quot;various&quot; node (the various
insertion points are defined in monodoc.xml).

    Now, launch your browser, and you should be able to browse the files
that were packaged up for distribution.

Miguel.
