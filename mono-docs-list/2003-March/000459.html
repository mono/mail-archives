<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> &gt; I might consider using it, yes.  But I am a bit behind there ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is arguably the best search library available for Java, but I haven't
</I>&gt;<i> looked in detail at the dot net port.
</I>
Well, that is very good news ;-)

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Where can I read up on the evolution searching library? Does it have any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; white papers/articles, API docs you could point me at?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; None of that sort, you would have to read the source code ;-(
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hmmm. I suspect reading C source code isn't a quick way to learn an API,
</I>&gt;<i> and reading C# wrapped C source code is an even slower way!
</I>
Heh, I would not be too concerned about this.  The API looks pretty
simple, I have placed a tarball here:

	<A HREF="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/tmp/camel-index.tar.gz">http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/tmp/camel-index.tar.gz</A>

&gt;<i> If it really does get adopted for monodoc, would there be any chance of
</I>&gt;<i> you convincing the relevant person to write a high level overview of the
</I>&gt;<i> library's architecture and/or key code points?
</I>
Yes, I think this can be done.  I just happened to be familiar, because
its the new and improved search engine (with a scalable incremental
updating facility, which might turn out to be important if we allow
pluggable documentation to be introduced).  This is the second
generation of text searching that was written for Evolution, and the
design was driven by the requirements exposed by Evolution with large
inboxes with large histories. 

&gt;<i> Is there any time frame/deadline on the browser's search development? If
</I>&gt;<i> you think it might be worth it, I may take a look into how much work a
</I>&gt;<i> Lucene based search feature would take?
</I>
No timeframe at this point.  As soon as I can get my hands on it, but I
have a lot on my queue right now.

Miguel.
