<PRE>Hello!

&gt;<i> What's the current status of the monodoc browser? Is anyone working on
</I>&gt;<i> back/forward functionality?
</I>
Funny you mention this, I started doing this today.  

I should have something soon.

&gt;<i> How's search/indexing coming along? Is there a design or
</I>&gt;<i> work-in-progress for any of it?
</I>
I have not done any of this, but my thoughts were something like:

	* Have a tool that would take an `all.xml' file and construct
	  the index/table of contents based on this.

	* Each provider would be given a chance to populate the index
	  with any data it felt convenient.

	* There will be name collisions, so we should take this into
	  account.  So for example, there might be many matches for
	  `ToString' 

For searching, I want to reuse the Evolution searching library.  Michael
Zucchi from Evolution has been kind enough to package the library as a
standalone library that we can use, but I have lacked the time to work
on integrating it.

Those are just my thoughts at this point.

Miguel.
