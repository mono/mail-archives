<PRE>Hey guys,

&gt;<i> Now, one &quot;cute&quot; feature would be to autodect, this could be done by
</I>&gt;<i> loading an assembly &quot;MonoRenderGecko.dll&quot; and &quot;MonoRenderGtkHtml.dll&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> first you try loading the first and initting it from a `try' statement,
</I>&gt;<i> if that fails, fall back to MonoRenderGkthtml.
</I>
I was adding the &quot;cuteness&quot; but ended up with some doubts (caused also
by a mail from BenM saying the requeriment for gecko is proably to
hard). Now, at compile time, it is *required* to have gecko-sharp and
gtkhtml-sharp. I was wondering which possibility do you think is
better :

 * Make gecko-sharp conditional (compile time) so, we end up with
MonoRenderGecko.dll if it is present. In this case,
MonoRenderGtkHtml.dll will not be necessary and we can add that
Renderer to the browser.exe, so if it fails to load the Gecko library,
it uses the GtkHtml in the same assembly.

 * Make both conditional (but at least require one). In this case, we
build both assemblies (GtkHtmlRender.dll and GeckoRender.dll) and
decide in runtime which use, with preference for Gecko.

 * Just as it is now, requiring both and building both assemblies
(GtkHtmlRender.dll and GeckoRender.dll) and at runtime take Gecko as
default.

I'm inclined for the first one or probably the second one, but before
dealing again with autotools I want to be sure.

Reggards, Mario
