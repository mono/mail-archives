Rethinking this, I think a `--since=tag' would be sufficient, as
checking name+version seems superfluous now.

&gt;<i> It might be useful to decouple tracking which things were added in which

</I>&gt;<i> purposes.
</I>
Indeed, which is what Gtk# is already doing, using &lt;since/&gt; only for
display purposes.

&gt;<i> I played with adding versioning support a while back and what I came up

</I>&gt;<i> tags, it used the AssemblyVersion tags that already existed for types
</I>&gt;<i> (and I guess I added them for members) to track the first version in
</I>&gt;<i> which a type/member is seen.  When a type/member is stubbed for the
</I>&gt;<i> first time, or for legacy docs with members without an AssemblyVersion
</I>&gt;<i> tag, it inserts the AssemblyVersion.  But on future updates, it no
</I>&gt;<i> longer modifies that information.  That leaves the AssemblyVersion with
</I>&gt;<i> the first version in which the type/member appeared.
</I>
I'm less sure about this one, as I'm not sure I see the point.  What
would be the benefit to having an AssemblyVersion for every member?

&gt;<i> This also solves the annoying issue of every type XML file changing when
</I>&gt;<i> the assembly version changes, because that tag doesn't get updated anymore.
</I>
As Mike mentioned, it would be nice to remove all assembly version
information from the Type.xml files.

&gt;<i> It doesn't work for back-versioning existing docs, like tagging things
</I>&gt;<i> in the corlib with 1.0.*.*, since it will only insert the current
</I>&gt;<i> assembly version on newly added types and all (legacy) members.  But
</I>&gt;<i> updating the corlib is another issue entirely because we can't load the
</I>&gt;<i> 1.0 corlib in monodocer anymore anyway.  (We can have a special system
</I>&gt;<i> to back-version.)
</I>
Or we need to rethink monodocer being a .NET 2.0 app, and instead have
monodocer and monodocer2 for 1.0 and 2.0 profiles.  We could maintain
each using `#if NET_2_0' to split out the 2.0-specific code.

Though this probably doesn't matter either.  We'll want documentation
for the &quot;latest and greatest assembly version&quot; (mscorlib 2.0), and the
&lt;since/&gt; elements can specify which members were not in 1.0, so the lack
of a monodocer/monodocer2 split should be OK.

&gt;<i> Then the &lt;since/&gt; tag is left to display whatever you want.  But, since
</I>&gt;<i> monodocer is already tracking the actual assembly version things were
</I>&gt;<i> introduced in, it's possible to automatically insert documentation here
</I>&gt;<i> with any format -- i.e. version 2.1.2.0 becomes &quot;The 2.1 release of
</I>&gt;<i> MyLib#.&quot;.  We can have a command line option that maps assembly versions
</I>&gt;<i> to strings for since tags, overriding a default of just using the
</I>&gt;<i> assembly version unchanged:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     --since 2.1.*.*=&quot;The 2.1 release.&quot;
</I>
Again, I'm not sure that monodocer needs to actually care about assembly
versions at all.

We could just do `--since &quot;Gtk# 2.10&quot;', and all new types/members would
get a &quot;&lt;since version=&quot;Gtk# 2.10&quot; /&gt; element inserted.  It would *only*
apply to added types/members, and there is no worry about
checking/comparing assembly versions or anything like that.

If `--since' isn't provided, then &lt;since/&gt; is never generated.

This is less &quot;automagic&quot;, but it provides more control as well.

Thoughts?
