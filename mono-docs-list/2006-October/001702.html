To answer this out of order and up front -- yes.

Just to formalize the problem you point out, the version will be wrong
just when a type/member was added in a previous/now-outdated version
that was not yet monodocer'ed.

&gt;<i> So if someone is writing documentation for an assembly that has
</I>&gt;<i> already had several releases (i.e. they're not writing docs
</I>&gt;<i> concurrently with the code), or if they accidentally forget to modify
</I>&gt;<i> the assembly version before running monodocer, or any number of other
</I>&gt;<i> random mishaps which are likely to happen, the version information
</I>&gt;<i> for the inserted member *will* be wrong.
</I>
Those same problems happen with the --since method, and in both cases
(metadata vs --since) you end up with wrong stuff that is non-trivial to
correct.  (Not impossible or even difficult if you still have an older
version of the assembly around.)  So I agree that version metadata has a
sort of less-reliable quality that the rest of the metadata, but I don't
see it as a compelling reason to abandon the information completely.

&gt;<i> Which may not be entirely problematic, but if it can be wrong we'll
</I>&gt;<i> have to expect the user to potentially update it
</I>
We can have an option in monodocer so the user can provide an older
assembly to back-version items: both back-versioning the metadata as
well as correcting --since tags that should have had previous versions.

&gt;<i> To mutilate an idea you propose later, perhaps we could add an
</I>&gt;<i> attribute to the &lt;since/&gt; element which contains the current assembly
</I>&gt;<i> version, e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;since version=&quot;Gtk# 2.4&quot; assembly-version=&quot;2.4.0.0&quot; /&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> though I'm not sure this actually buys anything, for the reasons
</I>&gt;<i> listed above.
</I>
You don't mean &quot;current&quot; (as in what's put in
/Type/Assembly/AssemblyVersion) but the version that corresponds with
the &quot;version&quot; attribute, I think?  Are you suggesting it be
automatically inserted or user-written?

&gt;<i> Hence my problem, I don't see any way for the version information to 
</I>&gt;<i> ever be considered &quot;reliable&quot;...
</I>
I didn't really mean reliable as in something like &quot;assuredly correct&quot;.
 I was going for something like &quot;the node will assuredly contain a valid
A.B.C.D version string which is no earlier than the version in which the
type/member appeared, and provided the user runs monodocer on every
released version, then it will actually *be* that version.&quot;

That's close enough for me.  The information is no less reliable than
the &lt;since/&gt; tag, and in just the same cases where the since tag is
reliable (i.e. correct), the metadata version is not only reliable (i.e.
correct) but also machine-readable.

&gt;<i> I'm still not entirely sure what your entire proposal is.  Is it to
</I>&gt;<i> have two elements, //Member/Version and //Member/Docs/since, the
</I>&gt;<i> former being automatically inserted while the latter is controlled by
</I>&gt;<i> the user?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If so, this still doesn't permit easy change across all files
</I>
Ok.  Nevermind.  Updating metadata is slightly easier, but not so much
that it makes a difference.  (In order to back-version a type/member to
a version that you forgot to run monodocer on, you only need the old
assembly to update the metadata.  Any type/member present in the
assembly and the docs that has a future version set just gets reduced to
the old version number.  To update a &lt;since/&gt; tag, you need the old and
prior-to-that assemblies at the same time so you can figure out which
members were added in just that version.)

So here's my scenario.  I have a Makefile that runs monodocer whenever I
build my deployment package.  So, monodocer gets run on every released
version, which means that the version metadata will be kept up-to-date.
  Further, in my HTML docs I'm happy to list members as being since some
A.B.C.D version. In this case, I can leave version tracking entirely to
monodocer.  If I use --since, I have to remember to update it after each
release, and further I would be specifying the exact same thing that
monodocer could be figuring out for itself.
