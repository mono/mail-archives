<PRE>Hi Alejandro,

Great. It looks like there are a lot of people who want to contribute. Im
in the progress of posting my first toc written in Docbook.
I use the Borges framework which is used by the folks at mandrake.

The framework is very modulair. I also have definied the entity documents
and modules so when it's finished we could put it in a CVS and every
section has it's own xml file.
Sections can be added very easily.
However we have some problems with the make files I use, they don't work
on BSD we have to fix it someway.

When it's finished I'll post it here. May be some docbook experts
can check out?

I'll incorperate your additions also. The master toc is just a
start point.

I'll hope we soon can set up a CVS rep. for the XML docbook files so
everybody can start documenting on it in a structured way ;-)

Take Care,

Felix

</I>&gt;<i> I am Alejandro Sánchez Acosta, and now I am making all the GTK# tutorial

with the GNOME.NET tutorial.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the GTK# tutorial the work that we are making is porting all the
</I>samples from the gtk+ tutorial to gtk# and then when we have finished
that we begin with the documentation part. Johanes has made some
documentation part that you can see in gnometutorial.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here in Mono Hispano, we have made a lot of documentation about Mono,
</I>maybe some of the tutorials can be translated to english and have
covered some parts that proposed Felix in his fantastic index.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway it would be great that each one assign a part from the index that
</I>Felix has made, that is excelent, and then step by step we begin working
in the tutorial.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I want to colaborate with some parts from the tutorial, I have
</I>&gt;<i> experience with DocBook and I would like that all the tutorial would be
</I>made in DocBook format.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Other parts that we can reuse is the Documentation that is in Mono CVS,
</I>for examples, the README of each project explain well in that consists
and make a good introduction about the subject.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Other subjects that I would add:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Adding extensions to our programs embedding Mono.
</I>&gt;<i> 	1.1. With C.
</I>&gt;<i> 	1.2. With Perl.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Mono LOGO.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Mono-guile.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Mono Debugger Framework (MDF)
</I>&gt;<i> 	4.1. Backends.
</I>&gt;<i> 	4.2. Frontends.
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Monodoc.
</I>&gt;<i> 6. Mono Tools:
</I>&gt;<i> 	6.1. NUnit or NUnit2.
</I>&gt;<i> 	6.2. NAnt.
</I>&gt;<i> 	6.3. NGen.
</I>&gt;<i> 	...
</I>&gt;<i> 7. SharpDevelop a Free IDE in Windows part.
</I>&gt;<i> 8. In GNOME Tutorial talk about some applications relative to some parts
</I>like Platano, MPhoto, ..
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Only are some ideas, anybody want to propose anything more?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards.
