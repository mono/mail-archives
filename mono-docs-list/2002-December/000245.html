I don't think it's completely fair to say it has taken another focus.  It
has simply expanded in focus to include all the different things that fall
under the Mono umbrella.  Martin and Alejandro have a lot of Gtk#
material, and that is not going to be thrown away.

It is my understanding that all of the stuff in the original GNOME.NET
tutorial is going to be merged in.  And I will help bring the Mono Hispano
Gtk# stuff into this set of documentation as well.

Also, from what Alejandro said, there seem to be a lot of other ways to
use Mono for development than as .NET for Unix or C# for GNOME.  And I see
nothing wrong with providing intros and tutorials for all of these ways. 
After all, this is the main Mono site.  And here, of all places, it should
be more than ok to discuss everything related to Mono.
