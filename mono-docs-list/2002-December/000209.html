<PRE>Hello Felix, Norman, Martin and others.

Since you've introduced yourselves, I am going to do the same:

I am an e-commerce consultant with nearly 6 years of distributed systems
experience in C, C++, Java, DHTML, and SQL, in Unix and Windows
environments, with a bit of AS/400 and VMS integration work. I also know
Python, csh and bash, and I'm just now learning GTK+ and GNOME component
programming.

I would like to contribute to the documentation effort you are organizing.
 I could provide content for some of the chapters and tutorials, and help
proof-read and comment on chapter drafts as they are produced.  I'll be
happy to help as much as I can.

So if you think you can take on one more contributor, I'm here.

The TOC draft I've seen discussed on this list looks good.  We still need
to hammer down whether this documentation will consist of several
documents following the same style guide, or whether it will be a big
volume with dozens of chapters. (I'd prefer if it was the former: several
separate documents following the same style guide.)

I do not have any experience preparing documentation for free software
projects. In fact, I'm just getting started contributing to free software,
although I've been leeching for years. :)

I've started to take a look at HOW-TOs on DocBook and I'm also reading up
on Borges.  I don't have Mandrake, but I have RedHat 8 and Debian 3 at
home.  I'm a Windows slave at work, so I could do some Windows.Forms code
samples and tutorials. :)

Regards,
--
