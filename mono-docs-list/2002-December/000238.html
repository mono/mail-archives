</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and more.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What do you guys think about merging these efforts?

</I>&gt;<i> I think that is a very good suggestion.

Yes, this is a must, lets not do things twice.

&gt;<i> Besides the Windows Forms chapter and tutorial, I could work with

</I>&gt;<i> faily solid.
</I>
Sounds good, how do you guys think we could arrange for different
languages? One front page where people choose their native language?

&gt;<i> As for calling it Mono Tutorial, I think what we have here is two
</I>&gt;<i> documents: &quot;The Mono Manual&quot; and &quot;The Mono Tutorial&quot;.  The first three
</I>&gt;<i> parts of Felix's Table of Contents draft were very manual-like in tone.  I
</I>&gt;<i> think that is what he was shooting for and I agree it is needed.  I'll see
</I>&gt;<i> where I can fit in that part of the work.
</I>
Okay, the thing important to me is that there is a common entry to the
documentation (a frontpage whatever where one can choose his language
and either the manual or the tutorial)

I also think that placing things together will benefit all, more people
will go and look for information the same place instead of searching all
over. 
Also it would be easier to merge things now, instead of waiting. Lets
create a common home for the stuff and give folks cvs access to it.

&gt;<i> Also it seems that we are rapidly expanding into a lot of tutorials
</I>&gt;<i> instead of just one?  I guess what I'm saying is that more contributors
</I>&gt;<i> are more than welcome, but we need to be careful we don't lose focus.
</I>
A good TOC should do it with big headlines first then divided into more
topics when you dive into it.

&gt;<i> I'm not trying to bring anyone down, I'm just a bit overwhelmed at all the
</I>&gt;<i> work still to be done, and the prospect of trying to keep it in sync.  But
</I>&gt;<i> I have to remind myself, we've only been at this for less than a week! :) 
</I>&gt;<i> If we work dilligently, it should take care of itself in the end.
</I>
Yep, we all want mono and related techs well documented :o)
