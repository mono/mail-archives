<PRE>Good day,

 

My proposal to you will be very surprising, as we have not had any personal contact. However, I sincerely seek your confidence in this transaction, which I propose to you as a person of transparency,honesty and caliber.
 
Let me first start by introducing myself properly to you. My name is Robert Savimbi cousin and Personal Assistant of Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, the leader UNITA (National Union for the Total independence of Angola). I got your email address from network directory. I apologize if I have infringed  on your privacy.

You may know that my Uncle was recently killed in a battle with the government troops of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on friday 22nd February, 2002. 
 
Now Mr. Antonio Dembo and general Paulo Lukamba who were my Uncle's second in command, has assumed office as leader of UNITA. In spite of this, UNITA is like a herd of cattle without shepherd. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado are still lobbying to oust them and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who see me as a threat to their ambitions, including General paula lukamba, are planning to kill me. For more information check www.angola.org. 

However, I am a young man who has ambitions and I am not in any way interested in wars, this is why I secretly left Angola and come here (Netherlands) to seek political asylum.

 I am sincerely seeking for your urgent help in respect to safe keeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account. It was on transit with a safe deposit company here in Netherlands, when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. 

As a matter of fact, this is the reason I chose to come to Netherlands to seek political asylum. It is very clear with the way things are now, that President Dos Santos will lobby the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, since he has already done this in Angola.

I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to put in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Please, treat this contact with utmost secrecy and confidentiality for security and safety reasons.

The help I need from you is clearing the box containing the funds from the security company, after which, it will be deposited in an account in your name, with my name as next of kin. The money shall remain in your custody till my asylum application is granted, and I have the permit to conduct business, then you will transfer the account to me. Meanwhile, the money can be invested into risk-free profitable ventures, and there will an agreement to protect my interest. I have all the documents that will enable you claim the consignment from the security company.

For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15% of the money, and we shall use 5% to carry out every expenses that we come across during the transaction and the investment process. The remainder of the 5%, shall be given to a charity of your choice.

I thank you in advance in anticipation for your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.

NOTE:your prompt response will be appreciated.
 

Sincerely,

R.Savimbi.



</PRE>
