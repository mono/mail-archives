INTRODUCTION: l am Mrs. Sade Daniels know this 
proposal will come to you as a surprise because we
have not met before either physically or through correspondence. 
I have no doubt in your ability to handle this proposal
involving huge sum of money.  

THE SUBJECT: MY HUSBAND CHIEF JOHNSON DANIELS (Now
Late)
was the Royal 
Head of my Community, JESSE (an oil rich town)in
Nigeria. My late husband뭆 community produces 3.5%  of the total crude oil
production in Nigeria and 0.5%  of the Dollar value of each barrel is paid
to my husband as royalty by the Federal Government. 

My husband was also the Chairman of  OMPADEC,Jesse
branch.In his position as the Royal head and Chairman of the
OMPADEC, Jesse branch,he made some money which he left for me and our children
asthe only thing to inherit. The money is Twelve Million US 
Dollars($12M). 

Though this said fund accumulated  between the
period 
1976-1998. Due to 
poor banking system in Nigeria and political
instability as a result of 
past Military rules (1985-1999), he deposited this
Money in a  Strong 
Room/safe with an open beneficiary in Apex Bank of
Nigeria pending 
when he would finish arrangement to transfer it abroad
as a CONTRACT 
PAYMENT. He  was planning this when he died late last
year of Heart 
Attack. 
 
THE PROPOSAL: Just before my husband died he called my
attention to the 
money and charged me to look for a foreigner who would
assist me in the 
transfer / investment of the funds abroad. So l would
be very grateful 
if you could accept to help me archieve this great
objective. 

I promise to give you 20% of the total funds
transferred to your vital 
bank account as compensation for your assistance. Five
percent 
(5%)would be set aside to take care of all expenses we
may incure during the 
transaction. To indicate your interest, contact me
urgently and 
confidentially for more information and the roles you
will play in this 
business. All the legal information concerning  this
Money will be sent to you 
as soon as we agree together. 

Send your reply through this mail box, or see the note
below 

Yours faithfully, 
Mrs. Sade Daniels.

N.B
I will like you to provide me immediately with your
full names, 
telephone and fax numbers to enable my eldest son
Hopewell Daniels to contact you.
He shall handle this transaction from A-Z on behalf of
the family.
Alternatively you can call him on his telephone
numbers
234-1-7759121, fax 234-1-7596291

code and he shall respond 'BORN-GREAT' before discussion.
Just to be sure that you are speaking to him.
