&gt;<i> PJ, Welcome aboard!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you can see, we're still getting organized.  However, if you want
</I>&gt;<i> to start plugging away, pick a topic from the TOC and give it a shot.
</I>&gt;<i> (for instance, what is Windows.Forms?)
</I>
Ok, I'll do that.  Once I pick out a topic I'll announce here so there's
no stepping on toes.  Heck, I'll just start with the Windows.Forms
topic.

Until we have some infrastructure for the documentation project, I'll
put up early drafts for review on my site (which means I'll have to find
a decent free host this weekend. I was meaning to do that eventually
anyhow. 8-p)

One Windows.Forms Introduction, 0.1-pre coming up. :)  I'll announce
here once my first draft is ready.

&gt;<i> We'll be using DocBook XML, see here for reference:

</I>
Yup, I've already started reading it.  Thanks for trying to set me up
with the link anyhow.

Au revoir,
