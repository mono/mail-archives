</I>
The monodocer part should be a fairly minor change, probably &lt; 100 LOC.
(Probably &lt; 20.)  The browser part will be somewhat more involved,
mostly as it deals with XSLT, but I don't think it will be terribly
difficult either.

Sadly, I'm not sure when I'll get a chance to work on this.  Hopefully
before year-end.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Is he still the only one in charge of the documentation approval?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, afaik.  The reason for Miguel as a bottleneck is for copyright
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; concerns -- we don't want someone copy+pasting MSDN documentation into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; monodoc w/o any form of validation before it's committed to svn.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Perhaps we just need a better automated validation system...but this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will be a concern no matter what format/architecture we have.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know and maybe I should have expressed myself clearer because the
</I>&gt;<i> point was that I was thinking this could be fixed as well in the new
</I>&gt;<i> system.
</I>
It would be nice to fix this -- perhaps with some Bayesian comparison
function and a set of &quot;editors&quot; to approve the changes? -- but
regardless, I doubt that such an improved process would require a format
change. :-)

&gt;<i> I personally prefer it over the mono approach of documentation. However
</I>&gt;<i> since /doc is used nowhere in the mono sources this is not an option for
</I>&gt;<i> documenting mono.
</I>
/doc isn't used for a variety of reasons -- many of them listed in the
monodocer man page -- including ease of translation (/doc doesn't scale
to having multiple languages), and that *good* documentation is *very*
verbose (examples, etc.).  I find that it's not uncommon for the
documentation on a member to be longer than the member itself.  Do you
*really* want all that documentation within the sources?

Furthermore, if you have a web-based documentation editing system, I'd
*really* not want that ANYWHERE near my sources, as a bug in the doc
system could cause the software to stop compiling...

&gt;<i> &gt; Furthermore, monodoc *already* supports 3rd party assemblies -- this is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how Gtk# and Mono.Fuse documentation, among other assemblies, is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; integrated into monodoc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know that monodoc already supports 3rd party assemblies but I was
</I>&gt;<i> thinking of measures that would enable 3rd party developers also to
</I>&gt;<i> benefit from the documentation contribution.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Which means some that the documentation might contain some kind of url
</I>&gt;<i> where contributions can be sent to. Apart from the current mono-only
</I>&gt;<i> contribution.
</I>
This sounds easy enough -- extend the .source XML format to include a
URL to send edits to.  Then the problem &quot;merely&quot; becomes one of
documenting the transport format/protocol so that others can write
servers to integrate with monodoc.  I believe the current protocol is
SOAP based, so that may need to change....

&gt;<i> Another point of which I have been thinking would be to add 3rd party
</I>&gt;<i> documentation without having to rebuild the browser and all the sources.
</I>
That's already possible.  Just add your (.source, .tree, .zip) set of
files to your $lib/monodoc/sources directory, and restart monodoc.
You're done.  Again, see how Gtk# and Mono.Fuse do things.

&gt;<i> Someway that users only have to open <A HREF="http://3rdparty.com/docs">http://3rdparty.com/docs</A> in the
</I>&gt;<i> documentation browser and the browser downloads all the documentation
</I>&gt;<i> and integrates them into the database backend.
</I>
This is a slightly different problem.  It should also be solvable by
having the concept of a &quot;local&quot; sources directory in addition to the
system sources directory, e.g. ~/.local/share/monodoc/sources/, nd have
the local directory read before the system directory.  Again, solvable
(though I don't know how difficult this would be).

&gt;<i> Still thanks for the fruit-full conversation. :-)
</I>
No problem.  I'd love to dedicate more time to to monodocer/etc., but
sadly I lack the time.  Hopefully I can dedicate some time later this
month, but I also have a 2nd baby due soon, so any potential free time
is likely going to disappear...
