Ahh I see.

Point taken, when I think of it this sounds like the way to go.

Ahh that would be nice, is your fixer tool in cvs? If not maybe a good
place to put it, is in gtk-sharp/doc/fixertool

Yes I think that would be doable.


&gt;<i> thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Duncan.
</I>

I was also thinking a bit about cleaning the dir: mono/monodoc/generator
Like removing: a.cs, b.cs and all.xml, then clean the makefile for the
test, gtk-docs, update-docs and *.trees section
Based on my assumtion that gtk# docs are build in the gtk# src dir, and
other docs are built in their own dirs.
I would like to make this cleanup if its okay with you. I can probably
have a patch ready today.

Also is generator.cs used?
