<PRE>Hello,
	There has been a lot of API changes in Gtk# lately and the updater
needs to be run rather badly.  I have been neglecting the docs due to
MonoDevelop, if someone wants to step and and get this going again
please do, and I'll help however I can.

Last time I did this I ran into a few issues, however:
1. whitespace was not being preserved, causing a lot of unneeded diffing
2.Somehow I got XML that wasn't well formed

both of these were probably a result of using mono from cvs and
System.XML changes (2 seems fixed at least)

Also, lots of things need to be removed from the *Sharp namespaces, and
the StudlyCaps-ing of fields may need a small one off tool, etc.

So in summary, if someone can give me some help with getting the updater
working right or make a better tool that would be wonderful.
