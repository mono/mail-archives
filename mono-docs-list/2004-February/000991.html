<PRE>Hello John,

&gt;<i> Anyone interested in documentation should not be scared with asking on
</I>&gt;<i> this list how to get involved.  In fact, please do ask so we can help
</I>&gt;<i> interested people.  I would love to get more people involved.
</I>
Okay, I'd love it, too. I'm using monodoc to add content, get some other
more complete, etc. I have some things done, but I'm not sure where
monodoc is saving the patches. I want the patches because the monodoc
upload service is not working (communications error). While this is
fixed, I don't want to loose the control of where my job are,  so i am
at least able to post the patch to the list. Don't bother, I'll dig the
monodoc sources, and if can't find anything, I'll ask for help.

&gt;<i> I am not sure why you think this is not done already.  Everything is
</I>&gt;<i> reviewed and we do coordinate with Gtk#.  Perhaps because it has not
</I>&gt;<i> been discussed on this list it is not obvious that this happens.
</I>
Am not sure, either :-\  It's clear that some of my appreciations are
not very clear from &quot;outside&quot;.

&gt;<i> &gt; 3) Things in the code that helps the documentation. In addition to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [TODO] pseudo-tag/attribute, a tag/attribute for saying who is currently
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; responsible for that page (valid for all docs). This should be used when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; someone picks a doc and say: I'll do it. The tag should say when the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contributor picked up the item and when is the &quot;soft-deadline&quot;. This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; soft deadline should not be there for pressure or anything like that,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rather for finding abandoned docs, and to let the newbie know if a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [TODO] item is already taken. These tags should help to keep the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maintainability of the whole thing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> There is gtk-sharp/doc/en/Gtk/TODO which shows unclaimed and
</I>&gt;<i> undocumented members of Gtk.  Anything that someone has not claimed
</I>&gt;<i> there is available for someone to work on.  There is also the
</I>&gt;<i> 'maintainer' attribute in the docs themselves for completed docs. 
</I>
Oh, my intentions about this were that the name of the writer could
appear in monodoc itself, as well as the date of pick-up and the such.
Having this info on each doc in the monodoc interface should help a lot
--talking about the productivity of the writer--, but I agree in that
it's not essential. However is a step forward in automating the tracking
of docs.

&gt;<i> As I said earlier I would love more people to get involved with the
</I>&gt;<i> documentation.  Anyone interested that needs some help getting started
</I>&gt;<i> should post here, join #mono on irc.gimp.org, or even contact me
</I>&gt;<i> directly and let us know what you need to get started.
</I>
Okay John, write me down :-)  I'm interested in doing some gtk# docs,
but as I'm not a gtk+ expert (by far), I'd like to integrate a lot of
things scattered out there on the net. The ecma and ms stuff could be
done later, as there are a lot of info out there on it, so my vote for
the Mono specific things.
