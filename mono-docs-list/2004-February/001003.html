I wrote some simple XPath tools to perform the move of all the
EventHandlers and EventArgs from the *Sharp namespaces into the base
namespaces.  There is still a bunch of API that has changed though that
I didn't fix.

The *Sharp namespaces are accurate now as far as what's left in them. 
We're down to GLibSharp and GtkSharp, and I'll probably work on
eliminating that public API after the 0.17 release.

The StudCaps struct field API has not been updated in the docs though. 
I don't know if the current monodoc updater will preserve any current
documentation for this change, though.  So it may be something better
suited to another XPath tool.  Not sure about that though.  Maybe duncan
or somebody more familiar with the updater can comment on that.  I need
to know soon though, because I want to release 0.17 tomorrow, and I want
the docs to reflect the current API if possible.
