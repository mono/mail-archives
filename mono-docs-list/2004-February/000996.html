<PRE>I was a little excited about this idea so maybe I can bounce a message 
back.  I imagined a very similar response. I know that there would be 
some extra hoops to jump through and certainly some synchronization 
issues - but as you mentioned the pay off could be pretty sweet in the 
end.

Perhaps using custom attributes or linking directly to the files 
themselves.  There is already so much work going into synchronizing - 
what would make it much harder?

Do you think that bringing this up on one of the more general lists 
could help?
