<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> The major advantage to this is that we don't need to finish stubbing out
</I>&gt;<i> 2.0 types/members before we can start generating the documentation for
</I>&gt;<i> those members.  Even if we don't have any detailed documentation, it's
</I>
And this is the key &quot;start generating documentation&quot;.   It is just *not*
happening. 

If we have not got much traction with people documenting 1.0, how are we
going to get more contributions to 2.0?

&gt;<i> &gt; 	* Under development of incomplete libraries should not be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	  documented, and this includes the Mono.Data assembly (not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	  to be confused with Mono.Data.SqliteClient,Sybase).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why?
</I>
Because it is a waste of time.

Until a library is used by a number of consumers the API is not
guaranteed to be stable, or well designed.  Documenting APIs that are in
flux is mostly a waste of time.

Considering that we have *stable* APIs that are undocumented,
documenting unstable ones makes no sense.   

&gt;<i> &gt; And finally, my last concern is that stubs are not documentation,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stubbing things out is the easy part.  Actually writing the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; documentation is the hard part, and we have historically not been able
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to attract people to do this work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Stubs may be the easy part, but don't underestimate their usefulness.
</I>&gt;<i> Wondering if a member is supported?  It's a lot easier to say &quot;is it in
</I>&gt;<i> monodoc&quot; than to say &quot;check the source.&quot;  (Granted, this won't work for
</I>&gt;<i> NotImplementedExceptions, but those are supposed to be a rarity, with
</I>&gt;<i> the stated policy that unimplemented members shouldn't be implemented at
</I>&gt;<i> all, precisely so that mcs can warn about unimplemented functionality.)
</I>
My major objection to the 2.0 support is that someone needs to make sure
that this actually works.

Miguel.
</PRE>
