If you have an svn account, you can add the files at any time.
Otherwise, you need to wait until one of us has a chance to update svn.

This also requires updating the monodoc build process.  Currently it
uses monodoc/generator/updater.exe, while it needs to use
monodocer/tools/monodocer.exe, as monodocer.exe supports generics while
updater.exe doesn't.

This change is trivial.

What is less trivial is that we want to separate the .NET 1.1 docs from
the .NET 2.0 docs.

This is also trivial -- add ``-since:&quot;.NET 2.0&quot;'' to the monodocer
command line, and any added types/members will get a &lt;since/&gt; element
added with the specified value.  If we assume that the previous docs
only contain 1.1 docs (and *all* of the 1.1 docs), then this works
fairly well.

This could all be done now, actually, but I had been holding off on
doing it as I wanted to change monodocer so that it could import the
ECMA 335 documentation, as ECMA 3rd Edition (and now 4th Edition)
contains documentation for many of the generic types/members, and we'd
like to make use of this.

However, as per discussion with miguel earlier last week, we currently
plan to always overwrite the existing docs with the new docs when
importing ECMA docs, so there is no reason to wait on updating the
monodoc/class docs for this new support.

Given this, I'll try to get updated docs committed to svn some time this
week, and work on the monodocer support later.

&gt;<i> The only way I can think of right now is adding the swf docs to the build 
</I>&gt;<i> process of monodoc. But I don't know if this is possible and how this will

</I>
This is correct, SWF would need to be added to the build process of
monodoc.  We really should make sure that all assemblies included with
mono are part of monodoc as well.

&gt;<i> Btw. I'm aware of the Assembler page in the wiki, I &quot;wrote&quot; it yesterday. But 
</I>&gt;<i> could you please tell me where is the difference between mdassembler and 
</I>&gt;<i> assembler?
</I>
mdassembler is a script which executes assembler.exe:

	#!/bin/sh

	prefix=/usr
	exec_prefix=${prefix}
	monodocdir=/usr/lib/monodoc

	exec /usr/bin/mono $monodocdir/assembler.exe &quot;$@&quot;

So it's easier for everyone to use.
