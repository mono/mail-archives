<PRE>On Sunday 17 December 2006 14:54, you wrote:
&gt;<i> If you have an svn account, you can add the files at any time.
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise, you need to wait until one of us has a chance to update svn.
</I>
No I don't have one. So I just pull some Tea and wait for the changes to 
happen.


&gt;<i> This also requires updating the monodoc build process.  Currently it
</I>&gt;<i> uses monodoc/generator/updater.exe, while it needs to use
</I>&gt;<i> monodocer/tools/monodocer.exe, as monodocer.exe supports generics while
</I>&gt;<i> updater.exe doesn't.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This change is trivial.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is less trivial is that we want to separate the .NET 1.1 docs from
</I>&gt;<i> the .NET 2.0 docs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is also trivial -- add ``-since:&quot;.NET 2.0&quot;'' to the monodocer
</I>&gt;<i> command line, and any added types/members will get a &lt;since/&gt; element
</I>&gt;<i> added with the specified value.  If we assume that the previous docs
</I>&gt;<i> only contain 1.1 docs (and *all* of the 1.1 docs), then this works
</I>&gt;<i> fairly well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This could all be done now, actually, but I had been holding off on
</I>&gt;<i> doing it as I wanted to change monodocer so that it could import the
</I>&gt;<i> ECMA 335 documentation, as ECMA 3rd Edition (and now 4th Edition)
</I>&gt;<i> contains documentation for many of the generic types/members, and we'd
</I>&gt;<i> like to make use of this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, as per discussion with miguel earlier last week, we currently
</I>&gt;<i> plan to always overwrite the existing docs with the new docs when
</I>&gt;<i> importing ECMA docs, so there is no reason to wait on updating the
</I>&gt;<i> monodoc/class docs for this new support.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given this, I'll try to get updated docs committed to svn some time this
</I>&gt;<i> week, and work on the monodocer support later.
</I>
Is the current documentation, including all user contributions for the 1.1 or 
2.0 version of the framework? Will the current contributions survive the 
change of the build process?

And in I my opinion this concept should be extended to meet the version 
changes of third-party assemblies that are shipped with mono as well. Because 
if we only distinguish between .Net 1.1 and 2.0 third-party assemblies can 
not be documented in a way where users see in which version of the assembly 
the api has been changed.


&gt;<i> This is correct, SWF would need to be added to the build process of
</I>&gt;<i> monodoc.  We really should make sure that all assemblies included with
</I>&gt;<i> mono are part of monodoc as well.
</I>
I've taken a look into it and this should be the list of assemblies to add:
(These are all assemblies that I've found in the GAC of a newly compiled mono 
which are not present in monodoc. But I guess the assemblies still under 
development like System.Transactions can be removed from the list.)

- Accessability
- CustomMarshalers
- FireBird
- l18n
- IBM.Data.DB2
- SharpZipLib
- Microsoft.Build.*
- Mono.C5
- Mono.Data.* (currently only SqlClient is included)
- Mono.Http
- OpenSystem.C
- PEAPI
- System.Design
- System.EnterpriseServices
- System.Management
- System.Messeging
- System.ServiceProcess
- System.Transaction


&gt;<i> mdassembler is a script which executes assembler.exe:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	#!/bin/sh
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	prefix=/usr
</I>&gt;<i> 	exec_prefix=${prefix}
</I>&gt;<i> 	monodocdir=/usr/lib/monodoc
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	exec /usr/bin/mono $monodocdir/assembler.exe &quot;$@&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So it's easier for everyone to use.
</I>
I've found that out by myself 5 minutes after I sent the mail. But still 
thanks for the answer :-)

Kind Regards,
Valentin S.
