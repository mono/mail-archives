Because that would imply removing the older tools, which would break any
number of existing projects; I know that removing monodocer and
monodocs2html would break Mono.Fuse and NDesk.Options, and probably
Gtk#.  These tools will need to remain for the foreseeable future, and
potentially may never be removed.  New tools can be restricted to just
mdoc sub-commands.

Furthermore, mdoc isn't a shell script, it is a C# .exe.  As such, I can
do such wonderful things as -r:monodocer.exe and invoke the monodocer
Main() function directly from mdoc.  Alas, this means that everything is
transferred between mdoc and the subcommands via a string[], but this
allows simpler maintenance and code re-use.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think I added -pretty because reformatting XML causes problems with

</I>
I found that without -pretty, all &quot;unnecessary&quot; whitespace was removed,
which resulted in *huge* diffs after minor updates (lack of newlines,
etc.).  Also (monodocer bug?), the initial monodocer output was usually
pretty-printed, even if -pretty wasn't provided, which resulted in
further executions *removing* the whitespace (thus contributing to the
diff problem).

What I have observed is that monodocer occasionally goes schizo and
removes whitespace from e.g. &lt;list/&gt; elements.  I have no idea why, nor
have I fixed this yet.

&gt;<i>  And I don't even recall what -name does.
</I>
Allows you to provide the project name. :-)

Also missing is -type, -namespace, -updateto....

And -overrides is enabled by default under `mdoc update`.
