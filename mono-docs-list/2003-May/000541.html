<PRE>Hello,


&gt;<i> &gt; make it work.   Here is a screenshot of running the new monodoc:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I get that if I revert my mono-ecma.xsl file back to before my changes. 
</I>&gt;<i>   Did you grab mine from <A HREF="http://taubz.for.net/monodoc/mono-ecma.xsl?">http://taubz.for.net/monodoc/mono-ecma.xsl?</A>
</I>
Ah!  Wget was trying to be smart.

The code is awesome!  I really like to get this into CVS.

I have to go to dinner, but here are a few comments:

	* Am a bit afraid of XSLT, because I dont know it, as most
	  on this list know, every time I needed a change, I had to 
	  post for help on this list.

	  Although the code is great, I wonder if am going to be able
	  to maintain it (or whether you are interested in maintaining
	  this moving forward, for say a few months).

	* The tables that render data use the full width of the screen,
	  because the different sizes for properties, constructors,
	  methods look ugly (this was a bug previously as well).

	* I would like all the text inside a section to be &quot;indented&quot;.
	  That was previously done by adding a table I believe.

After dinner I can check in the code, but I would like to get your
feedback on this.  The code is in fact very pretty.

Also, we got a few patches recently: one of them sorted members
(currently members are rendered in the order of the match, which makes
visual searching difficult).  Rachel added support for bulleted lists
(see [1])

[1] This was the patch:
+       &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;list[@type='bullet']&quot;&gt;
+               &lt;ul&gt;
+                       &lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;
+               &lt;/ul&gt;
+       &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
+
+       &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;item&quot;&gt;
+               &lt;li&gt;
+                       &lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;
+               &lt;/li&gt;
+       &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
