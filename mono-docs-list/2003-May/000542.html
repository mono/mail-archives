Great, thanks.

For a few months, sure.

&gt;<i> 	* The tables that render data use the full width of the screen,

</I>
Hmm, yes, ok.  I added width=100% to the tables.

&gt;<i> 	* I would like all the text inside a section to be &quot;indented&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 	  That was previously done by adding a table I believe.
</I>
It is, at least for me.  What do you mean by section?

&gt;<i> Also, we got a few patches recently: one of them sorted members
</I>
In the tree, right?  That shouldn't involve/interfere with my files.

&gt;<i> Rachel added support for bulleted lists
</I>
I noticed this in CVS.  I had already put that into my mono-ecma.xsl 
file, so you don't need to integrate that patch with my file.  (Sorry, 
Rachel.)  I added it slightly differently.

The new stylesheet already includes a lot of missing formatting 
transformations.  I looked at the ECMA DTD that was mentioned on this 
list a while back (I looked through the list archive) and added XSL 
templates for all of the missing formatting, unless I missed something.

There are two open issues with the stylesheet:

	Delegates lack sufficient information in the XML docs to hyperlink 
their signatures, unless their C# signatures are parsed. Instead, 
they're displayed as they are in the docs as plain text.

	Ref and out parameters are not distinguished in the docs, except in the 
textual method signatures.  So, again, without parsing the signatures, 
out parameters can only be listed as ref.

	I don't know where the ECMA docs come from, so I don't know if it's 
feasible to add more information to them.

Looking forward to seeing it eventually in CVS. :)
