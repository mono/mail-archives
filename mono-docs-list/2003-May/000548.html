Ahha, I just forgot to indent namespace type listings.

&gt;<i> Notice that &quot;GType&quot; comes after &quot;Vadjustment&quot;.

I experimented with putting static members at the end - thought maybe it 
would be easier to view.  That wasn't an alphabetical sorting problem. 
I removed that, so it's all sorted only alphabetically now.

That's not something I would ever want to attempt in XSLT, if it's possible.

 &gt; We could use a C# function to perform some of the work.

Seems like a backwards way to do it.  The information should have been 
present in the docs to begin with, really.

&gt;<i> We could add more docs by writing a program that merges the ECMA

</I>
I find this to be the best approach (though I'm not sure I have time to 
implement it).  After doing that, the docs would have an entirely 
machine-readable description of the classes.

&gt;<i> I should set you up with an account, so you can work directly with the 
</I>&gt;<i> code on CVS. 
</I>
Nifty, tho it might be a while before I get the chance to figure out how 
to get myself set up with that.
