</I>Dunno if that will work. Although I think Evo can parse it, and that
uses GtkHTML. Miguel, comments on this?

</I>&gt;<i> Yes, absolutely.  Will xsl:includes work since it's a resource file?
</I>Hmm, don't know. Gonzalo: can that be made to work somehow? We could
always copy the xslt files to a temp folder, but that is such a hack.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       * I think each language stuff should not be in xslt.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What stuff?
</I>Even if it is minimal, it should be separated. If not taken out of xslt
all together, at the least, put into a separate xslt file.

&gt;<i> What is missing from the stylesheet that could be reused from NDoc?
</I>NDoc is a bit more polished. It also generates its signatures at
runtime, rather than when the docs are compiled. And frankly, if we want
maintainability, the best way to do it is to latch on to code from
somewhere like NDoc.
