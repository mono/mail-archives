</I>Actually, XSLT is very maintainable, and not that hard to learn.
However, it is not right for some things (see below).

</I>&gt;<i> 	  this moving forward, for say a few months).
</I>I think we will have no problem finding mono people who know XSLT.

&gt;<i> 	* I would like all the text inside a section to be &quot;indented&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 	  That was previously done by adding a table I believe.
</I>NO! NO! You must mean setting a CSS property! (and I hope &lt;blockquote&gt;
didn't even cross your mind) A table (or block quote) is the wrong way
to do this, it should be done with CSS. Tables are just the wrong way to
format text. (watch out, I jump on people who use tables wrongly)

&gt;<i> Also, we got a few patches recently
</I>Talking of other modifications, I noticed that that blah.xml is in the
code. Lets make sure to remove that!

I also have some comments of my own:

      * I think the XSLT file is _way_ too big. Why don't we split this
        file apart? Each of the $show choices should be its own style
        sheet. We can use xsl:include for shared code. 
      * I think each language stuff should not be in xslt. XSLT was
        _not_ designed for programing. However, here, we have a problem.
        Right now XSLT does not implement custom functions (because it
        is just a wrapper around libxslt). Would it be possible to still
        have custom methods with libXSLT? Gonzalo, you wrote the XSLT
        code, comments on that?
      * It would be nice if we could reuse some of the code NDoc has
        created for making help documents. They use a strategy very
        similar to the one this patch has.
