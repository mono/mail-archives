<PRE>Attached is a patch to monodoc/tools to add support for Generics to
monodocer.exe and monodocs2html.exe.  (Next stop: adding support for
Generics to the documentation browser.)

The patch is also available at:

	<A HREF="http://balthasar.jprl.com/~jon/tmp/monodoc-tools.patch">http://balthasar.jprl.com/~jon/tmp/monodoc-tools.patch</A>

The monodocer.cs patch is fairly straightforward in concept, if not in
implementation: Don't use Type.FullName, *ever*, as Type.FullName is
generally not what you want.  It also leads to NullReferenceExceptions
when parsing generic classes (e.g. `class Foo&lt;T&gt; {}').

Monodocer.exe now generates Namespace/Typename`NumArgs.xml files for all
generic types, e.g. Mono.DocTest.Generic/MyList`2.xml.  Because the
filenames for generic types will never match the C# typename
(MyList&lt;A,B&gt;), I've added a new File attribute into index.xml.  (If you
don't like this, it should be possible to get the &quot;escaped&quot; MyList`2
form from the MyList&lt;A,B&gt; form, but this is easiest.)

XML generated is in the same spirit as the XML Documentation from
ECMA-335 3rd edition CLILibraryTypes.xml.  So generic members have &lt;...&gt;
in the method name, e.g.

	&lt;Member MemberName=&quot;SomeMethod&amp;lt;A,B&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;...&lt;/Member&gt;

As an &quot;extension&quot; to CLILibraryTypes.xml, &lt;typeparam/&gt; elements are
inserted for each type parameter.  This is in keeping with ECMA-334 3rd
edition, which suggests this tag for documenting type parameters.  (Not
sure why CLILibraryTypes.xml didn't use it.)

The one breaking change to monodocer.exe is that '+' is no longer used
for nested types, but '.' is used instead.  That is:

	public class Outer { public class Inner {}}

generates the file Outer.Inner.xml, while as before it would generate
Outer+Inner.xml.  This change is necessary for monodocs2html.exe, as
there is no way from a &lt;see cref=&quot;T:Namespace.Outer.Inner&quot; /&gt; reference
to tell which of those strings is the namespace, the outer class, and
the inner class (at least, no easy way that I can see), so removing the
'+' makes monodocs2html.exe easier to implement.

The monodocs2html.exe changes include the changes I previously sent to
this mailing list, and includes an overhaul for supporting generic types
and members.  It also follows some of the conventions used on MSDN, so
&quot;Class&quot; follows classes, &quot;Method&quot; follows methods, &quot;Generic&quot; is inserted
for generic types and methods, etc.

(It also is ugly-as-sin, containing joyfully recursive XSLT calls to
convert &quot;Foo&lt;A,B&gt;.Nested&lt;C&gt;&quot; into &quot;Foo`2.Nested`1&quot; constructs.  Lots of
fun.  Really.  Stop looking at me like that!)

I've also added unit tests to test both monodocer.exe &amp;
monodocs2html.exe, and has the added benefit that you can see what the
output from these tools looks like without needing to run it first.

[0] No, I don't mean permission to commit me to an asylum for all those
recursive XSLT templates!  Recursion is fun!
