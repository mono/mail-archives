<PRE>Hi!

&gt;<i> &gt; Overloads on method page looks good - maybe only anchors/links to overloaded method could be added.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I do this now.  Check the top of any overloaded function's page
</I>&gt;<i> (constructors are overloaded methods too)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Click on the method name to jump to that method.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Did you mean something different?
</I>
I mean exactly this. Cool! Maybe that XSLT is not so bad. Maybe I should learn it... ;-)


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - There's very little indication of whether a member is static / public
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; / const etc.  These should be made more visible.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes. I already point to it several times, but nobody aims attension to this...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Point to it?  Where?
</I>
There on docs-list. But there was (still are?) other priorities as doc browser and editor...


&gt;<i> &gt; Only one: In the class members page, could you add result type to method signature? Maybe parameters could be
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I think that would be a big improvement.  I'll add this to the TODO
</I>
&gt;<i> I thought it looked fairly confusing with arguments added, but maybe it
</I>&gt;<i> would be OK if the font size was reduced.  It will take some fiddling.
</I>
Great. It will be much better to see

void Close()   Closes the current TextReader instance and releases any system resources associated with it.

instead of

Close  Method  Closes the current TextReader instance and releases any system resources associated with it.
  

&gt;<i> &gt; I like much more that scheme with prop/methods/cons/events/fields split up. Maybe this could be splitted simillary in public/protected view? (two levels split) 
</I>&gt;<i> Or do you mean, first sorted by type, then sorted by access, THEN sorted
</I>&gt;<i> by name?  I can do that without much trouble too, and that does sound
</I>&gt;<i> useful.  I'll add some deeper combinations to the next release.
</I>
Yes. I mean this (oh - I know - mine English is not so good as it could be and mine sentences are sometimes weird. I write without any spellchecker or grammarchecker. It was one reason to my interest in docs - I could learn some English style and improve expressing myself)

I do not find that public/protected view useful. You are usually looking for some specific method (either by name or by action) and not by whether it is public or protected. So I suggest, first sort them by type (prop/method/event/field) and than it could be sorted by other keys: static/nonstatic or public/protected or alphabetically. That second key could not be divided by any line or header to save some space...

  
&gt;<i> Finally, I guess my layout is a bit confusing.  It's not clear, for
</I>&gt;<i> instance, that you go to the summary page by clicking on &quot;TextReader&quot; at
</I>&gt;<i> the top (also by clicking on either the &quot;Public Members&quot; or &quot;Protected
</I>&gt;<i> Members&quot; table titles).  Problem is, I don't want to clutter up the page
</I>&gt;<i> with &quot;To view the summary page, click _here_&quot; messages.  If anyone has
</I>&gt;<i> any ideas on how to make navigation easier, I'd love to hear them.
</I>
Understand you, but sometimes it is better. Maybe only add some &quot;toolbar&quot; to the top, where you could add link to the namespace, to the class and to members overview.


Moreover, I maybe could help you and make some style-sheet for generated pages. I have no experience with XSLT but some with CSS2. But I'm not graphic designer in any respect so do not expect much. Is XSLT+CSS common practise? And is it good idea in our case? I hate to do something fruitless

Regards,
Martin
