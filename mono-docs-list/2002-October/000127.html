<PRE>[Seems like I sent this to the wrong mailing list last wee]

Hey guys,

   This is a summary of the discussions that Adam and I have had, and a
few of the things that have happened in the last few weeks regarding
documentation.

   * Assembly Documentation

        We use Adam's tool to extract a skeleton of what needs to be
        documented and we call this the &quot;master skeleton file&quot;.  This
        file is currently being extracted from the Microsoft assemblies,
        so we can start documenting against the real thing.

   * ECMA templates

        I have checked into CVS the documentation for each of the types
        that part of ECMA.  We will be using this as the &quot;source&quot; for
        the actual documentation.

   * Gtk#/Qt# Documentation Editor

        We are working on a documentation editors using both Gtk# and
        Qt# which should simplify the editing of the documentation.

   * Browsers

        We need the XSLT stylesheets that I requested on mono-list
        before we will have a documentation browser, but we do not
        anticipate this being hard to write, in fact they will be
        very fun to write once we get some nice XSLTs that we can use
        to do the actual rendering.

        I also have some master plans so we can plug multiple backends
        for the documentation, and integrate not only the ECMA Apis,
        but also later integrate the C# spec, and hey, even man pages
        could be browsed with a Mono-based help browser.

Miguel.
