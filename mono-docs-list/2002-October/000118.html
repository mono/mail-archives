Miguel and I thought the docs should live in the same file heirarchy as the 
actual libs.  I'm not sure what we will do with the /doc/classes/ directory.

We might be adding access modifiers in the future, but this is not as 
straightforward as it might seem.  VB and C# use different keywords for 
access modification...

MkMaster only works with Microsoft's runtime for the now.  Mono needs some 
more Reflection methods to make it work.  The Master.xml files you see in 
Mono's cvs tree were generated from the Microsoft dll's and with the 
Microsoft runtime.  This is another way to ensure that Mono remains 
compatible with the Microsoft implementation.

Cheers,

Adam
