<PRE>&gt;<i> Moreover, I maybe could help you and make some style-sheet for generated pages. I have no experience with XSLT but some with CSS2. But I'm not graphic designer in any respect so do not expect much. Is XSLT+CSS common practise? And is it good idea in our case? I hate to do something fruitless

CSS would make great sense here, because it would simplify a lot the
work of getting nice HTML.  Jakub sadly has been too busy to produce a
nice layout, would you be interested in giving it a shot?
