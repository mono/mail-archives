<PRE>Hello!

&gt;<i> Announcing release 0.2 of statidoc, code named &quot;Clark is Paid by the
</I>&gt;<i> Pound&quot;.  Things are starting to get interesting.
</I>
Awesome job!

&gt;<i> Statidoc is an XSLT-based documentation generator.  It is meant to be
</I>&gt;<i> the basis for online documentation viewers, but it produces perfectly
</I>&gt;<i> good static HTML documentation as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First, the demo.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    <A HREF="http://www.rinspin.com/~bronson/mono/statidoc-0.2/output/index.html">http://www.rinspin.com/~bronson/mono/statidoc-0.2/output/index.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The struck out links show where xml documentation files are missing. 
</I>&gt;<i> All other links should now work.  If you find any that don't, please
</I>&gt;<i> email me.
</I>
The demo is excellent ;-)

&gt;<i> Building:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to build the docs on your own machine, you only need the
</I>&gt;<i> monodoc CVS tree and the Sablotron XSL processor.  Download statidoc-0.2
</I>&gt;<i> from
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    <A HREF="http://www.rinspin.com/~bronson/mono/statidoc-0.2/statidoc-0.2.tar.gz">http://www.rinspin.com/~bronson/mono/statidoc-0.2/statidoc-0.2.tar.gz</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> unzip it in your monodoc directory, and follow the directions in the
</I>&gt;<i> readme.
</I>
How much of the stuff is particular to the Sablotron XSL processor?  We
will be using a different processor for the Mono implementation, and I
would like to know if it is easy to replace (we will be using libxslt
through the .NET Xstl API). 

&gt;<i> Overloading works, but I don't like the way it's laid out.  Right now, I
</I>&gt;<i> don't include arguments, so you see a bunch of identical method names,
</I>&gt;<i> so it's confusing.  When I do include arguments, however, it's too
</I>&gt;<i> cluttered and, yes, confusing.  Does anybody have any suggestions on how
</I>&gt;<i> to nicely handle overloading?
</I>
In the Microsoft documentation a single entry is shown for it, and if
you click on it, you go to a page where you see the N overloaded members
(you get basically a summary page for them).

My only suggestion at this point is to try to make the output match the
layout of the Microsoft docs, which is what most of us are familiar
with.   But this is only a tiny suggestion, you have now done all the
really hard work, and it is now up to us to produce the documentation
browser. 

Thanks a lot for the work.
Miguel
