<PRE>Hello!

&gt;<i> Barring bugs, none of it.  It's all standard XSLT 1.0.
</I>
Excellent, thanks a lot Scott.

&gt;<i> Even so, I should make this thing use the .NET Xstl API.  What is the
</I>&gt;<i> status of this API?  I don't see anything in CVS...
</I>
The API should be there, we are basically using a very gross hack to
call into LibXslt.

&gt;<i> &gt; In the Microsoft documentation a single entry is shown for it, and if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you click on it, you go to a page where you see the N overloaded members
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (you get basically a summary page for them).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I like this a lot.  However, right now there's insufficient information
</I>&gt;<i> in the XML files to generate it.  The XML files include a summary for
</I>&gt;<i> every individual overloaded function, but no summary for all overloads
</I>&gt;<i> of the same name.  It appears that Microsoft wrote these themselves.
</I>
We could just generate a page with some common text:

	This method is overloaded, here are the signatures:

Followed by the actual method signatures with links and the method
summary.  I do not think we need to write a terse description of this
for now. 

&gt;<i> We can do this, but we'll have to modify the XML files to add the
</I>&gt;<i> overload summaries.  Technically it would be easy, but is it a good
</I>&gt;<i> idea?  How are the XML files in the CVS tree generated?  Are they just
</I>&gt;<i> straight from ECMA?
</I>
Lets not do this for now, lets circle back to this if we see that there
is a big demand for it, but currently each method has enough information
that I doubt that there is a lot of value in adding more information for
the overloaded group.

Miguel
