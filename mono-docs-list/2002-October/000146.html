<PRE>&gt;<i> How much of the stuff is particular to the Sablotron XSL processor?
</I>
Barring bugs, none of it.  It's all standard XSLT 1.0.

Even so, I should make this thing use the .NET Xstl API.  What is the
status of this API?  I don't see anything in CVS...

Fixing the alphabetizing will require moving to either XSLT 2.0 or
taking advantage of custom processor extensions (it looks like libxsl's
exslt extensions will work for this).  Here's an example of the
alphabetizing screwup:

<A HREF="http://www.rinspin.com/~bronson/mono/statidoc-0.2/output/en/System/Array.xml,members.xsl%5Bl=en,view=t%5D.html#Property">http://www.rinspin.com/~bronson/mono/statidoc-0.2/output/en/System/Array.xml,members.xsl%5Bl=en,view=t%5D.html#Property</A>


&gt;<i> In the Microsoft documentation a single entry is shown for it, and if
</I>&gt;<i> you click on it, you go to a page where you see the N overloaded members
</I>&gt;<i> (you get basically a summary page for them).
</I>
I like this a lot.  However, right now there's insufficient information
in the XML files to generate it.  The XML files include a summary for
every individual overloaded function, but no summary for all overloads
of the same name.  It appears that Microsoft wrote these themselves.

We can do this, but we'll have to modify the XML files to add the
overload summaries.  Technically it would be easy, but is it a good
idea?  How are the XML files in the CVS tree generated?  Are they just
straight from ECMA?
