Well, I do this now.  Check the top of any overloaded function's page
(constructors are overloaded methods too)

Click on the method name to jump to that method.

Did you mean something different?


&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - There's very little indication of whether a member is static / public
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; / const etc.  These should be made more visible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. I already point to it several times, but nobody aims attension to this...
</I>
Point to it?  Where?


&gt;<i> Only one: In the class members page, could you add result type to method signature? Maybe parameters could be useful as well. And maybe C# similar signature should be used insted of that Name/Access columns (esp. when static/new/unsafe/... added) [I found it little confusing]
</I>
Yes, I think that would be a big improvement.  I'll add this to the TODO
list.

I thought it looked fairly confusing with arguments added, but maybe it
would be OK if the font size was reduced.  It will take some fiddling.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I like much more that scheme with prop/methods/cons/events/fields split up. Maybe this could be splitted simillary in public/protected view? (two levels split)
</I>
You mean like this?

<A HREF="http://www.rinspin.com/~bronson/mono/statidoc-0.2/output/en/System.IO/TextReader.xml,members.xsl%5Bl=en,view=a%5D.html#public">http://www.rinspin.com/~bronson/mono/statidoc-0.2/output/en/System.IO/TextReader.xml,members.xsl%5Bl=en,view=a%5D.html#public</A>

In the next relase I'll add a list organized by static/non-static
(dynamic?) as well.

Or do you mean, first sorted by type, then sorted by access, THEN sorted
by name?  I can do that without much trouble too, and that does sound
useful.  I'll add some deeper combinations to the next release.


Finally, I guess my layout is a bit confusing.  It's not clear, for
instance, that you go to the summary page by clicking on &quot;TextReader&quot; at
the top (also by clicking on either the &quot;Public Members&quot; or &quot;Protected
Members&quot; table titles).  Problem is, I don't want to clutter up the page
with &quot;To view the summary page, click _here_&quot; messages.  If anyone has
any ideas on how to make navigation easier, I'd love to hear them.
