<PRE>Announcing release 0.2 of statidoc, code named &quot;Clark is Paid by the
Pound&quot;.  Things are starting to get interesting.

Statidoc is an XSLT-based documentation generator.  It is meant to be
the basis for online documentation viewers, but it produces perfectly
good static HTML documentation as well.


First, the demo.

   <A HREF="http://www.rinspin.com/~bronson/mono/statidoc-0.2/output/index.html">http://www.rinspin.com/~bronson/mono/statidoc-0.2/output/index.html</A>

The struck out links show where xml documentation files are missing. 
All other links should now work.  If you find any that don't, please
email me.


Building:

If you want to build the docs on your own machine, you only need the
monodoc CVS tree and the Sablotron XSL processor.  Download statidoc-0.2
from

   <A HREF="http://www.rinspin.com/~bronson/mono/statidoc-0.2/statidoc-0.2.tar.gz">http://www.rinspin.com/~bronson/mono/statidoc-0.2/statidoc-0.2.tar.gz</A>

unzip it in your monodoc directory, and follow the directions in the
readme.


Help!

Overloading works, but I don't like the way it's laid out.  Right now, I
don't include arguments, so you see a bunch of identical method names,
so it's confusing.  When I do include arguments, however, it's too
cluttered and, yes, confusing.  Does anybody have any suggestions on how
to nicely handle overloading?

Bugs:

- A few members don't sort properly.  Fixing this properly requires XSLT
2.0.  Read the BUGS file for more.

- There's very little indication of whether a member is static / public
/ const etc.  These should be made more visible.

- The totals on the summary page don't always add up.  This will require
a bit of investigation.


Now that the basics are in place, suggestions are welcome!

    - Scott
