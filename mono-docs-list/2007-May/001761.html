<PRE>Hello,

I've got a short and simple question. For whom is the Developer Resource 
Category for? People who want to develop apps by using Mono, or Mono-Hackers 
themselves?

If it is a mixup of both I would suggest to separate this into three 
categories.
1. Developer Resource: For people developing in mono.
and
2. Mono Hacker Resources: For people hacking mono directly.
3. Windows Porting: For dev from the windows world who would like to run their 
app on mono. (Just to have a single entry point for all the stuff that is 
currently spread across the wiki.) (This is maybe a subcategory of cat.2)

Because articles like <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Compacting_GC">http://www.mono-project.com/Compacting_GC</A> are just to 
much for the ordinary developer who would like to run it's app on mono. In 
addition I'm also thinking of splitting the mono-framework category into a 
part which is of interest to the &quot;normal&quot; user who just wants to run his apps 
on mono and the &quot;power&quot; user who is interested in a deeper knowledge of mono.

I have to ask this question since I'm trying to work out a way to reorganize 
the Developer Resource Category in a way that makes it easier to understand 
and which will help people to find the information they need more quickly.

Kind Regards,
Valentin Sawadski
