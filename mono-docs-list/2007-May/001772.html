Hello !

&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> as said in the Heading, the new Version of the Use-Page has just been finished 
</I>&gt;<i> and I'm now waiting for some comments/suggestions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If anyone is willing to review, look here:

Wow, nice job (not easy to try to structure a documentation) ! Your
suggestion gave me an idea. I still have to work on it when it will be
ready I will make a proposal here.

Here is my opinion for the current &quot;New&quot; template :

1. &quot;Getting Mono&quot; : I would remove this, you already have another &quot;entry
point&quot; for that (the &quot;Download now&quot; link is the most natural one that
will be used). The &quot;use&quot; section, in my book, must be solely dedicated
to product use aspects.

2. The logic behind the sections ordering should follow a kind of
&quot;natural order&quot; : first you want to know what Mono is and this is the
goal of the &quot;start&quot; section, next you download it, next you want to see
it in action on your machine or want to start writing your own
(Web)apps/with it, next you want to deploy your applications and so on.
As you develop your application, you might want to refer to the API or
to some stuff like whitepapers or Howtos/samples as Miguel suggested. Do
you see my reasoning ?

What disturbs me in my idea is that the support section is the kind of
stuff people love to see at the first glance. So it definitely has to be
obviously visible. May its current location in your template is the best
option. I do not have something better to propose for it for the moment.

3. [Your work is still a draft proposal, I do not know if your idea was
to go on that way] : I would remove the &quot;Resource&quot; frame since it, IMHO,
messes up the section. Its contents could be put somewhere else like
being merged in some way in the grey menu or put through the different
paragraphs.


kind regards,

Adrien
