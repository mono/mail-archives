Hello !

&gt;<i> I was thinking about the howtos as well but came to the conclusion that it

</I>
Very good idea, that will help to keep the information tidied. 

&gt;<i> If someone interested in developing web-apps there should be an 
</I>&gt;<i> Category &quot;Web-Apps&quot; containing the various howtos.
</I>
I was having a look at &quot;most wanted page&quot;. But links requires to have an
account. Is there a way to register a new account directly on the
site ? 

&gt;<i> This way other users won't be bothered by howtos they do not want to see.
</I>
Exact. I suggest to add an index of them somewhere, it is pretty useful

&gt;<i> (Btw. is it just me or are we the only ones actively participating in this 
</I>&gt;<i> mailing-list?)
</I>
(I have seen some other posts ;-) May the others subscribers prefer to
see how the debate and things are going on for the moment. I hope they
will enter in the arena, additional opinions are needed !)

&gt;<i> &gt; I have seen the changes on the page, glad to see an invisible green
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; frame ! By the way, should the site be &quot;ported&quot; to an ASP.Net 2.0 portal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like MojoPortal running under Mono ? It would be a great demonstration
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that the Mono project relies on its own back-end products ;-) PHP is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; great but it sounds like &quot;concurrent&quot; technology.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This thought already came up once in the mailing list but I do not know what 
</I>&gt;<i> has been discussed in particular so you should probably check the archives.
</I>
With the actual project progression, it would be a great benefit.
Really. Mono is capable of running &quot;enterprise-class applications&quot;
especially ASP.NET web-applications, demonstrating that directly with
mono-project.net website will score points and give an amazing good
first-impression.

&gt;<i> &gt; About the site audiance : what the project want target ? Is the website
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should only designed for downloading mono, getting support/news/white
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; papers/API reference ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From <A HREF="http://mono-project.com/Mono_Documentation_Improvement_Project">http://mono-project.com/Mono_Documentation_Improvement_Project</A> :
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The is designed to be a centralized repository for all mono-related 
</I>&gt;<i> documentation and information, to make it easy for users to find what they 
</I>&gt;<i> need.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
It seems the &quot;wanted documentation&quot; section is reserved to registered
users. How can I create a user account on the site ? The form allows  to
login only (may I missed something). Should I register on Novell Forge
or should I ask to someone ?

&gt;<i> &gt; [My idea is going on a bit slowly this week but it goes].
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can't wait to see it.
</I>
Be patient you will see the first results very soon may be this weekend ;-)

Sorry for short answers, I have many things to finish this afternoon !

Kind regards,

Adrien
