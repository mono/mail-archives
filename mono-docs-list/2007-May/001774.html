What I always find to be interesting is that while Mono is frequently a
little slower than the various Java flavors, it usually requires less
memory, rather useful for embedded environments...

&gt;<i> Maybe ask an independent third party, or ask someone who has published

The above Debian site regularly reruns their tests.

</I>
It's not so much that Mono itself is fat.  It's that the class libraries
are extensive.  This can be ameliorated by shrinking the class libraries
by removing types and methods, which is what the Assembly Linker
permits, and what the Silverlight support will use (since it also uses a
smaller class library).
