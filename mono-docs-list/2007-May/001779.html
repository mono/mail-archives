I was thinking about the howtos as well but came to the conclusion that it 
would be better not to have all howtos in one-place but to seperate them by 
topic for example:

If someone interested in developing web-apps there should be an 
Category &quot;Web-Apps&quot; containing the various howtos.

This way other users won't be bothered by howtos they do not want to see.

(Btw. is it just me or are we the only ones actively participating in this 
mailing-list?)

&gt;<i> I have seen the changes on the page, glad to see an invisible green
</I>&gt;<i> frame ! By the way, should the site be &quot;ported&quot; to an ASP.Net 2.0 portal
</I>&gt;<i> like MojoPortal running under Mono ? It would be a great demonstration
</I>&gt;<i> that the Mono project relies on its own back-end products ;-) PHP is
</I>&gt;<i> great but it sounds like &quot;concurrent&quot; technology.
</I>
This thought already came up once in the mailing list but I do not know what 
has been discussed in particular so you should probably check the archives.

&gt;<i> About the site audiance : what the project want target ? Is the website
</I>&gt;<i> should only designed for downloading mono, getting support/news/white
</I>&gt;<i> papers/API reference ?
</I>
From <A HREF="http://mono-project.com/Mono_Documentation_Improvement_Project">http://mono-project.com/Mono_Documentation_Improvement_Project</A> :

&quot;The is designed to be a centralized repository for all mono-related 
documentation and information, to make it easy for users to find what they 
need.&quot;

&gt;<i> [My idea is going on a bit slowly this week but it goes].
</I>
Can't wait to see it.

Kind Regards,
Valentin Sawadski
