<PRE>Hello again,

</I>
Oh very thanks! :-)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is my opinion for the current &quot;New&quot; template :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. &quot;Getting Mono&quot; : I would remove this, you already have another &quot;entry
</I>&gt;<i> point&quot; for that (the &quot;Download now&quot; link is the most natural one that
</I>&gt;<i> will be used). The &quot;use&quot; section, in my book, must be solely dedicated
</I>&gt;<i> to product use aspects.
</I>
That figures. Removed it.

&gt;<i> 2. The logic behind the sections ordering should follow a kind of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;natural order&quot; : first you want to know what Mono is and this is the
</I>&gt;<i> goal of the &quot;start&quot; section, next you download it, next you want to see
</I>&gt;<i> it in action on your machine or want to start writing your own
</I>&gt;<i> (Web)apps/with it, next you want to deploy your applications and so on.
</I>&gt;<i> As you develop your application, you might want to refer to the API or
</I>&gt;<i> to some stuff like whitepapers or Howtos/samples as Miguel suggested. Do
</I>&gt;<i> you see my reasoning ?
</I>
I intended to follow this &quot;natural order&quot; because if you want to use something 
you have to get if first right? Therefore I wanted to have a crash-course for 
how to get Mono but since the download link is perfectly visible it is more 
natural for users to go there.

&gt;<i> What disturbs me in my idea is that the support section is the kind of
</I>&gt;<i> stuff people love to see at the first glance. So it definitely has to be
</I>&gt;<i> obviously visible. May its current location in your template is the best
</I>&gt;<i> option. I do not have something better to propose for it for the moment.
</I>
Probably I do. But that seems to a topic of it's own so I'll start a new 
thread for it.

&gt;<i> 3. [Your work is still a draft proposal, I do not know if your idea was
</I>&gt;<i> to go on that way] : I would remove the &quot;Resource&quot; frame since it, IMHO,
</I>&gt;<i> messes up the section. Its contents could be put somewhere else like
</I>&gt;<i> being merged in some way in the grey menu or put through the different
</I>&gt;<i> paragraphs.
</I>
Thank god I'm not the only one who does not like that green box :-D
(Just left it there because it was there in the original version).

Kind Regards,
Valentin Sawadski
