Sort of.  IIRC, the license was originally unspecified; lots was
written, but not everyone documented (a) what they wrote, and (b) what
license they had written it under.  I know that some of what I wrote I
contributed to the Public Domain (interop.html).

This issue was last brought up in July 2003.  My recollection was that
this was never fully settled; it was pointed out the GNU FDL was listed
as the license for some documentation, that X11/BSD would be preferable,
and that we'd have to talk to each of the contributors to see if they'd
be willing to re-license.  I don't see anything remotely like each
contributor explicitly stating what license they released their work
under, but my email archive only goes back to February 4, 2002. 

BTW, monodoc explicitly mentions that any contributions are licensed
under X11, so we know at least know what all new API documentation
should be licensed under.
