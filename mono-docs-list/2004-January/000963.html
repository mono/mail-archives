<PRE>Well I thought that monkeyguide was too in MIT X11 license like monodoc,
seeing this situation I think it will be better that all the
documentation is under one license be it X11 or GPL FDA. I have some
unfinished docs for monkeyguide so it will be good for me to know the
consensus on this.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sort of.  IIRC, the license was originally unspecified; lots was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; written, but not everyone documented (a) what they wrote, and (b) what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; license they had written it under.  I know that some of what I wrote I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contributed to the Public Domain (interop.html).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This issue was last brought up in July 2003.  My recollection was that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this was never fully settled; it was pointed out the GNU FDL was listed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as the license for some documentation, that X11/BSD would be preferable,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and that we'd have to talk to each of the contributors to see if they'd
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be willing to re-license.  I don't see anything remotely like each
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contributor explicitly stating what license they released their work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; under, but my email archive only goes back to February 4, 2002. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BTW, monodoc explicitly mentions that any contributions are licensed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; under X11, so we know at least know what all new API documentation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should be licensed under.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think what Jon summarized is correct as far as I recall. Everything I
</I>&gt;<i> have contributed can be licensed under X11.
