Excellent.

&gt;<i>  - the index document layout has to change to support multiple

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;assemblies&gt;&lt;assembly&gt;&lt;attrs&gt;... layout, but I'm unsure if this is the
</I>&gt;<i> way to go.  I think this index file is only used for the docs2html
</I>&gt;<i> translation, so I need input on the desired layout.
</I>
It's also used by monodoc --edit so monodoc doesn't have to scan the 
directory layout.

I think what you've done is fine.  There's no need to separate out the 
type listing by assembly.

&gt;<i>  - The index assembly attr updating is broken. I decided not to waste
</I>&gt;<i> time on this until I had a better feeling for how they are used and what
</I>&gt;<i> they should look like.
</I>
Yeah, I guess I never did that since it's not used anywhere.

&gt;<i>  - DoUpdateNamespace just looks in the first assembly supplied. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> uncertain what the typical use case is for this so it's unclear whether
</I>&gt;<i> we should support multiple assembly namespace updating.
</I>
I think we can get rid of that feature entirely.  (Does anyone on the 
list use it?)

&gt;<i> I'm a little concerned about the volume of information that monodocer
</I>&gt;<i> puts on the console.  It would be nice if &quot;Updating Foo&quot; was only
</I>&gt;<i> written to the Console if Foo has changes.
</I>
Yeah, sure.  I didn't do that because it was hard to figure out when a 
file was changing, from the way the xml is updated.

&gt;<i> Also, when members are to be deleted but --delete is not specified,
</I>&gt;<i> would it be okay to add a &quot;Deprecated&quot; attr like the old updater used to
</I>&gt;<i> do.
</I>
Oh, I didn't know the old updater did that.

I don't really think it's useful to add a Deprecated attribute -- the 
output of monodocer is a good indication of what needs fixing.  But 
that's just me.

Patch looks good to me, BTW.
