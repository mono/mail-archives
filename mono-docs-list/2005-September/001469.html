If the user is not willing to deal with the fact that our classlib docs
has mostly stubs, they are going to end up using another documentation
browser. For example, I usually use terminal server to a Windows
computer to look up docs because I can use the .net doc browser.

Now, lets say we integrate an msdn viewer. This will make it easy to get
to the &quot;good&quot; docs. Thus, we will increase the use of monodoc. This has
a huge side benefit: since people are inside monodoc, they can easily
write docs for stubbed methods. We could even play on this fact; we
could put a message on top of the msdn page for each member we have
stubs &quot;Mono's free documentation only has stubs for this method. Help us
out by writing docs&quot;. We'd have to be careful not to encourge plagiarism
with this, but I think it could help us rather than hurt us.

I'd also like to remind you that most monodoc users (I'd guess upwards
of 90%) do not contribute to the documentation, and there is almost
nothing we can do to get them to do so (except maybe a bribe^Wcontest).
not including a way to get to the msdn docs is just making their life
harder, with no benefit to us.
