<PRE>Hello,

2005/9/24, Ben Maurer &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-docs-list">bmaurer at andrew.cmu.edu</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> get some idea of what it does. So why not make this process easier, by
</I>&gt;<i> providing them a usable interface (IE, a treeview that doesn't suck in
</I>&gt;<i> firefox)?
</I>The reason are what Joshua already said. If the user has a great doc
(msdn) at hand, they will just move to look there and not to use mono
docs, because what they care is having a good doc and not where that
doc come from (well, most part of the users). But that is just my
opinion.

&gt;<i> &gt; BTW, the msdn doc utility is incomplete, as you cannot click on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; links (and it won't be easy to fix);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Shouldn't be all that hard. All I need to do is intercept the link click
</I>&gt;<i> from gecko, load it, and sync the toc, all of which are actually pretty
</I>&gt;<i> easy (there is data in the html pages for toc syncing).
</I>I wast just not aware of the details.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  so it needs a lot of work before
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; being added.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO, this tool is useful today even without any more features. It is
</I>&gt;<i> 10x faster for me to use my tool than it is to use firefox.
</I>
Hey, Ben, I think you took my email as an attack to the msnd doc,
which is not. I think is a great tool, I was just wondering if it
could have some negative effects including it on monodoc. Maybe it
will be better to keep separate. But maybe I'm wrong.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Also, it is made with gtk#2 and we use gtk#1 in monodoc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Miguel has talked about bumping monodoc up to depend on gtk#2. Once we
</I>&gt;<i> do this, I'd love to see the primary tree be moved to the new api. But
</I>&gt;<i> for now, I could live with another tab.
</I>hey, I would like to be aware of that. I think that will solve a bug in elabel!

Mario.
