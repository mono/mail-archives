<PRE>My 2 cents:

I agree 100% with Ben. The MSDN documentation is available and it is
better than what we current can offer, period. Giving developers the
best dev environment is the end goal here so making them jump through
hoops to get to msdn is silly. As I've said before, embedding Ben's
browser into a tab in monodoc (thus making the differentiation between
doc sources clear to the user) if pretty doable and I would be willing
to give it a try *if* Miguel gave the OK so I don't waste my time in a
hack that would never see the light of day.

</I>&gt;<i>
