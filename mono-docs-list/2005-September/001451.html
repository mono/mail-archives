</I>&gt;<i> &gt; here's the updated patch. It took me some time to get this to you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because I updated my docbrowser and monodoc sources so I had to merge
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the printing patch upstream. This time I basically edited the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; browser.glade file by hand, adding only the needed entries.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Let me know what you could use a hand with next.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I took your patch and worked a little bit with it. This are the things
</I>&gt;<i> I've changed:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Since we already have an abstraction for separing Gecko and GtkHTML
</I>&gt;<i> with IHtmlRender and the two implementations (Gtk and Gecko), I've
</I>&gt;<i> moved all the printing logic to them, so we can get rif of
</I>&gt;<i> IPrintManager and GtkHTMLPrintManager. I do think is more sane now. I
</I>&gt;<i> have used a Print method only with a parameter, the html code, because
</I>&gt;<i> when using css, the html code returned by the HelpSource already has
</I>&gt;<i> the css.
</I>Makes sense to me. My patch was hacked without much knowledge of the
underlying monodoc structure. 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - The print menu item is only clickable when you are not editing a node
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - I've encountered problems because the two kinds of Url presents in
</I>&gt;<i> monodoc (with your patch, the browser crashed when printing a node
</I>&gt;<i> which was accesed through the treeview). I think now it works.
</I>I'll try to track this down further since it sounds like a possible
issue with the provider no returning the node's html.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - The ecma provider was not tracking well the use_css variable. Now,
</I>&gt;<i> it will print the html according to it. (For the moment, everything
</I>&gt;<i> without css)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - I've left out the thing with gnome-stock-about and gtk-about because
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure it's really important now, try to open a bug in bugzilla.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>	AFAIK, the gnome-stock icons are deprecated. I believe we can safely
change that to gtk-stock-about without adding any regression problems. 

&gt;<i> By the way, I think the monodoc section of bugzilla is forgoten and
</I>&gt;<i> unmaintained. Miguel, can you give me permission to deal with it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Comments?
</I>	Monodoc's bugzilla has been pretty dead for some time now... I remember
there's even an old patch that I submitted in there. 


Overall everything sounds good Mario, I hope the patch makes into the
next release.
