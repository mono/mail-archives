<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> At the risk of being rejected, I would like to propose that monodoc be
</I>&gt;<i> split into at least two seperate packages. I know this has been
</I>&gt;<i> discussed before, but I don't recall anyone ever formally asking. 
</I>&gt;<i> This is primarily for the following reasons:
</I>&gt;<i> - So Gtk# can depend on monodoc-common to conditionally build and install its
</I>&gt;<i> docs while avoiding the circular dependencies.  This will allow those
</I>&gt;<i> building from cvs or newer Gtk# tarballs to get those docs installed
</I>&gt;<i> automatically, and uncouples the two packages.
</I>&gt;<i> - The doc build has grown to taken a substantially large time, so that
</I>&gt;<i>   building monodoc from a tarball or cvs sucks (at least for me).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So my request is (name however you want):
</I>&gt;<i> monodoc-common - contains the docs, tools, monodoc.dll, mod, the monodoc pc file
</I>&gt;<i> monodoc - contains the Gtk# frontend (and the web stuff if you want)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I volunteer to do this if it is a time constraint for you to do so.
</I>
Well, currently am the maintainer for the documentation, and I do not
want to add more responsibilities to my existing list of tasks during
the release process.   

That is the only reason I have not done the split (and I think the
split should probably be slightly different as well), but the issue is:
splitting means more work for me right now.

I think its a great idea, but I want to get the 1.0/1.2 effort moving
before I would do this.

Miguel
