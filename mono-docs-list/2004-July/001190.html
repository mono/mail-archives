<PRE>Hi all,

Quick question about Monodoc's tree loading scheme. It loads the tree
layout from basedir/monodoc.xml and then populates the nodes with data
found in the basedir/sources/ directory.

Keeping the layout information in one file seems problematic to me
because I can't add a new node to the tree as a third-party package.
Similarly, the distributed monodoc.xml file has a bunch of nodes for
documentation that I don't have installed: dia-canvas, gecko-sharp, etc.

Surely it would make more sense to create nodes in the tree along with
each source? I haven't started writing my patch yet but it must at least
be possible, and it seems a lot more sensible to me. The only downside I
can think of is that you lose control over the structure of the tree,
but that seems like a pretty minor concern.

Any comments? (Please CC as I am not subscribed.)
