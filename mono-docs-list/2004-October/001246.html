That wouldn't be a problem, as most of the Mono.Posix functionality
won't work under Windows (no getpwnam(3), etc.), unless you're running
under the POSIX environment (which likely *would* include man pages).

&gt;<i> The problem with having a man page provider is that, I think, every page

</I>
What I'm thinking is that we'd generate the normal stubs for the
Mono.Posix classes, so we'd have the standard tree view (Members,
Methods, etc.).  *Within* the documentation of a given method would be a
link to the man page, e.g.:

	This function wraps the POSIX function getpwnam(3).

	&lt;a href=&quot;man:getpwnam(3)&quot;&gt;See the getpwnam(3) man page for 
	details.&lt;/a&gt;

Thus, the man page wouldn't be exposed in the tree view or the index,
but inside the method documentation itself.

&gt;<i> &gt; 2.  Is it/will it be possible to link between the different sets of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; providers?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why doesn't it work now?  IIRC, the ECMA docs link between the docs with 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;a href=&quot;T:...&quot;/&gt;...
</I>
I mean linking *between* providers.  For example, my &quot;Managed and
Unmanaged Code Integration&quot; guide in Monodoc uses the XHTML provider
(node: /Mono Documentation/Mono Handbook/Advanced
Topics/Interoperability/Platform Invoke).

Within my XHTML document I refer to the class library documentation:

	...create a &lt;a href=&quot;T:System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImport&quot;
	&gt;DllImport&lt;/a&gt; function...

Which causes the XHTML provider to reference the ECMA provider.  Except
that this doesn't work; attempts to actually *follow* that link
generates an error:

        No stream for this node:
        html/en/wrapping/T:System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImportAttribute with code (html/en/wrapping/T:System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImportAttribute)

So cross-provider linking doesn't work as nicely as I'd like, as I would
*love* to be able to integrate content between the different providers,
but this doesn't seem to work (tested with Mono 1.0.x; HEAD might have
this fixed for all I know).
