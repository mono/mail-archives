I *think* -- but have not tested or verified -- that using the
&lt;include/&gt; doc comment in your sources (and having the &lt;include/&gt;
comment refer to mdoc repo comments) would permit this.  Documentation
would remain in the mdoc repository, but you'd get a warning for all
members that lacked a &lt;include/&gt; element.

Of course, this is ~trivially &quot;subverted&quot; -- the &lt;include/&gt; could refer
to documentation which just says &quot;To be added&quot;, which isn't very useful.

&gt;<i> A useful intermediate step would be if i could put mdoc update into

</I>&gt;<i> postbuild can generate warnings).
</I>
So if there's a member that has 'To be added' as the value, mdoc should
generate a warning/error on STDERR.  This should be easy to add [0].

However, what should the semantics be?  *All* elements shouldn't have
'To be added', or can some have it, etc.

Another problem (which can't be solved) is that, even if we do print out
a warning (e.g. print out the //MemberSignature[Language='C#'] value),
we can't map this to a source code line number.  We can provide the type
+ member (which should be enough to get to the problematic member), but
not line numbers.
