Plus the first time update runs, that &quot;To be added&quot; doc will be  
generated anyhow. And if i am to go external with docs, i'd rather be  
completely external.

Just got the source from svn, will have a look whether I can figure  
that part out.

&gt;<i> However, what should the semantics be?  *All* elements shouldn't have
</I>&gt;<i> 'To be added', or can some have it, etc.
</I>
For my case at least i would want the error to be on anything not  
properly documented. This is where warning instead of error would be  
nice, so it's something you will clean up before check-in, but you're  
not blocked from testing and refactoring in the meantime.

&gt;<i> Another problem (which can't be solved) is that, even if we do print  
</I>&gt;<i> out
</I>&gt;<i> a warning (e.g. print out the //MemberSignature[Language='C#'] value),
</I>&gt;<i> we can't map this to a source code line number.  We can provide the  
</I>&gt;<i> type
</I>&gt;<i> + member (which should be enough to get to the problematic member),  
</I>&gt;<i> but
</I>&gt;<i> not line numbers.
</I>

I can live with that as well. What I'd really like to do is create a  
visual studio extension that uses mdoc to check and generate docs,  
provide warnings that link to the code and allow the two-way  
navigation between code and doc xml by clicking in the source on  
either side. However, i can see that being a pit of quicksand, so i  
wouldn't even make any claims that i would attempt that until i have a  
prototype :)
