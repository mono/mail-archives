</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Contains (almost) no information duplicated in assembly metadata
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Shares many tags and conventions with the XML documentation schema

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    be trivial)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thoughts, please.  If this is worthwhile (and I get a response from the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; list ;-), an XSD, tag manual, stub generator, and translators to/from the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; csc generated output style will follow as quickly as I can crank 'em out.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>One other reason to use the CSC format (I am not sure if this is the

Hey Miguel,

I agree with most of what you're saying, with the exception of a point 
addressed below. :-)  I believe, though, that proving a schema that is 
reasonable for hand-editing (all we can do right now) is important, so we 
can start the documentation process sooner rather than later.  As Nick 
mentioned in his comments to the list, using this more readable version 
temporarily allows us to start documenting quickly, easily switch between 
formats, and provides an easier path for misguided hand-documenters in the 
future. ;-)

&gt;<i>XML is not supposed to be hand-edited anyways.
</I>
I don't necessarily agree with this.  After all, inline C# comments are 
XML.  Large XML files are certainly difficult to read and edit, but there 
will always be folks who would rather do their documentation and 
translation work in EMACS rather than in our shiny GUI.

My current thinking is this: A GUI is good; I can't wait to build and use 
it.  A GUI is necessary.  A GUI should not be the only way to generate, 
validate, or create documentation.  TMTOWTDI, baby.
