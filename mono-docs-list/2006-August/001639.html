That's what I had in mind. I wanted to say that it makes no sense to me to 
continiously translate pages for parts that are still under development. Only 
&quot;stable&quot; parts of the software and wiki shoul be translated.

As for your proposal to translate pages based on a release / frequency of 
changes. That may work, it may be a real good idea, but in my humble opinion,  
only if done properly.

In addition to assigned translators for keeping the articles in sync, it would 
be best if each translated page has a reference to the revision of the 
original page, which the translation is based on. In cases where a newer 
version of the original exists than the reference for the translation, the 
translated page should be marked as &quot;Not Up-to-date, please view the original 
page&quot;.

Kind regards,
Valentin.
