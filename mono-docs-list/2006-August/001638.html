<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> to be honest I personally would like to have a site about mono in my native 
</I>&gt;<i> language (german) and I'm pretty shure I'm not alone with that opinion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But as for the translation of <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com">http://www.mono-project.com</A> in other languages 
</I>&gt;<i> does not seem to me like a good idea. At least not now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mono is still under heavy development and a lot of content in the wiki is 
</I>&gt;<i> being added, changed and removed so that it might be really difficult to have 
</I>&gt;<i> a usefull, up-to-date wiki in all available languages.
</I>
It is partly true but in general no. Most of the pages has been
unchanged for months or years.

Fresh pages are very likely be updated, but it's what also happens
to static documents. Usually translators are resigned to update
them in sync (or async ;-)

You should compare those wiki pages with static documents. If you
continue translating static documents release by release, you will
notice that the changes are constantly ongoing but mostly as minor
changes.

If it is being difficult to update translations consistently with
the original, you could create a snapshot of the entire wiki pages
release by release, or every certain span.

&lt;top-secret&gt; I left my translation pages for months :-/ &lt;/top-secret&gt;
