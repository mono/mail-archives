<PRE>Good idea! 
As a beginner in C# and mono it is hard to start writing!
More examples and examples ;)

Is there possibility to create in (GTK#) something like JTable in java?(cells like in Calc or Excel)

 
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Ben O'Steen&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-docs-list">monobosteen at maysubdivide.org</A>&gt; 08/14/06 12:49 PM &gt;&gt;&gt; 
</I>I would like to help out by adding documentation for various parts of
Mono/Gtk# that I have been experimenting with, but I am having some
problems.

First, I'd like to state that it's my opinion that you can learn the most
about an API by seeing the source of a few examples, ones that perform
simple, yet fundamental tasks.

For example, Miguel de Icaza's blog piece,
<A HREF="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2005/Nov-">http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2005/Nov-</A> 26.html, taught me more about web
services in C# in a single page than pretty much any resource I found
later or earlier.

For that end, I'd like to submit sample code and notes to a few entries on
the monodoc, but I am not sure if there is a standard position/cataloguing
point for this.

For example, I have written an example of a (very) basic web browser,
which uses System.Net and Gtk.HTML at its core. All it does it load the
text and the images, but the techniques needed weren't that well
documented. I feel that documenting some practical code might help, but
where should I put it? Under the main descriptor for HTML? On the wiki as
a HowTo? As part of the documentation for handling http streams?

I would add it to the wiki (<A HREF="http://www.mono-">http://www.mono-</A> project.com) , but it seems
that the self- creation of new members is blocked. (eg
<A HREF="http://www.mono-">http://www.mono-</A> project.com/index.php?title=Special:Userlogin&amp;returnto=Main_Page
doesn't allow new signups) This would be understandable in itself, but the
documentation effort page
<A HREF="http://www.mono-">http://www.mono-</A> project.com/Mono_Documentation_Improvement_Project implies
that editing the wiki to improve documentation is a Good Thing(tm).

Can anyone provide me with a little advice as to how to proceed?

Thanks

Ben
