</I>I'm getting a similar thing. It just sits there saying &quot;Checking server
version&quot;.

Using ethereal, it seems that what is happening is this:
1. monodoc checks the server version
2. the server sends back a 0, which seems to mean OK to send
3. monodoc invokes GetSerial

The request seems to get sent okay - there don't seem to be any
particularly weird differences between the two requests - but the server
never sends a reply back, and monodoc gives up. From reading
monodoc/browser/server.cs, It seems that CheckVersion doesn't hit the
database but GetSerial does. Is it possible that it's waiting for the
database until things start to time out?
