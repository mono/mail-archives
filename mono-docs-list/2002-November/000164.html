DEAR FRIEND,

YOUR COMPANY'S NAME AND ADDRESS WAS GOTTEN FROM A
BUSINESS DIRECTORY IN MY SEARCH FOR  A WELL KNOWN
BUSINESSMAN WHO HAS NO QUESTIONABLE CHARACTER AND MUST
BE A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN.  

AS A MATTER OF FACT, I AM JUSTICE MUSA , A
DIRECTOR IN THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC POWER AUTHORITY
(N.E.P.A).  ALSO I WAS PRIVILEGED TO BE A MEMBER OF
TENDER'S BOARD THAT AWARDED AND SUPERVISED THE
EXECUTION OF A MULTIMILLION U.S. DOLLARS CONTRACT IN
1998.  THE CONTRACT  HAS BEEN COMPLETED AND
COMMISSIONED IN AUGUST 1996,AND ORIGINAL CONTRACT
VALUE PAID IN OCTOBER 2000, TO THE FOREIGN FIRM THAT
ACTUALLY EXECUTED THE CONTRACT. 

HOWEVER, AS A RESULT OF OVER-INVOICING AND SERIES OF
REVISION CARRIED OUT IN THE COURSE OF THE CONTRACT
EXECUTION, THERE NOW EXISTS A FLOATING SUM OF
US$45.5M(FORTY FIVE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND  U.S
DOLLARS ONLY).  THIS MONEY IS NOW DUE FOR PAYMENT IN
THE GOVERNMENT QUARTERLY PAYMENT SCHEDULE AND WE WISH
TO REMIT THIS FUND INTO YOUR DESIGNATED PERSONAL OR
CORPORATE ACCOUNTS OVERSEAS.
 
WE SHALL SECURE THE PAYMENT APPROVALS FROM THE
RELEVANT OFFICE/MINISTRIES HERE FOR THE RELEASE OF
THIS CONTRACT SUM IN FAVOUR OF YOUR COMPANY WITH
DOCUMENT AND INFORMATION WE SHALL REQUEST FROM YOU
TOO, WE HAVE NOW CONCLUDED ARRANGEMENTS IN THE CENTRAL
BANK OF NIGERIA TO REMIT THIS MONEY AS SUM REALIZED BY
A COMPANY THROUGH LEGITIMATE MEANS IN NIGERIA.  

TERMS AND CONDITIONS 

THE FUND WILL BE SHARED 35% FOR YOU AND 60% FOR US. 
THE  REMAINING  5% TAKES CARE OF ALL INCIDENTAL
EXPENSES.  TO FORMALISE THIS TRANSACTION IN NIGERIA IN
FAVOUR OF YOUR DESIGNATED COMPANY WE REQUIRE
YOUTOFORWARD THE FOLLOWING:

IN ALL  PLACES AT ALL TIMES ON BOTH SIDES.

ADDRESS, ACCOUNT NUMBERS, TELEX AND FAX
NUMBERSANDE-MAIL NUMBER OF YOUR BANK.

RELEVANT DOCUMENTS/APPROVALS.  

THIS REMITTANCE IS GUARANTEE IN LESS THAN 14(FOURTEEN)
WORKING DAYS UPON RECEIPT OF THE ABOVE MENTION
PARTICULARS BY FAX, HOWEVER, IT REQUIRES THE HIGHEST
CO-OPERATION,  SERIOUSNESS, MUTUAL TRUST, HONEST 
AND STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL ON BOTH SIDES TO AVOID

GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONARIES.  ALSO WE WANT TO USE PART OF
