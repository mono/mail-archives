an example is:
you purchase $100 of credit and you get a card with $200 credit that you can spend on anything that accepts master card. 
the extra $100 if yours to spend on anything and does not have to be repaid... Just in time for the holidays. 




YOU MAY NEVER HAVE TO PAY FOR GROCERIES AGAIN! 

The worst you could do is spend $199.95 and save $504 for the year eating in or out. 
Plus! The greatest benefit of all: commissions earned from your team members' activity in the sales organization. In fact, it only takes 3 personal sales of GroceryBiz memberships and you get your money back. And better yet, why buy groceries when you could earn them for free. For every GroceryBiz Membership you sell you get a $50 grocery card. This is a no brainer. Let's get started today. 

Other GroceryBiz Benefit and Savings plans, such as the Health Benefits, Telecommunications and Internet Service, and more are featured at grocerybiz.org and can be featured on your own website. 


Would you like to NEVER pay for groceries again?
