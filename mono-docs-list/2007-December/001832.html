</I>
To elaborate further, Microsoft documentation for .NET 3.5 uses
parenthesis to enclose type parameters (as already mentioned).

The next issue, if you want a &quot;truly&quot; language-agnostic description, is
the Members view of a given class, e.g. Class Library -&gt; System -&gt; Array
-&gt; Members.  Monodoc currently shows all type parameters AND the full
parameter list, e.g. AsReadOnly&lt;T&gt;(T[]), while .NET 3.5 shows only the
method name and type parameters, e.g. AsReadOnly(T).

The &quot;advantage&quot; to the .NET approach is a more language-agnostic display
-- no language uses (T) for type parameters, though it *is* close to
VB.NET which would use (Of T).

The disadvantage is that .NET doesn't show argument lists.  Perhaps this
isn't necessary, but I find that this leads to extra clicks within
msdn2.microsoft.com as they &quot;collapse&quot; all overloads into a single link.

This &quot;collapsing&quot; doesn't help though; see:

<A HREF="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.array.binarysearch(VS.90">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.array.binarysearch(VS.90</A>).aspx

When you view the overloads, you see _all_ overloads for a given method,
*plus* type parameters, resulting in such &quot;helpful&quot; language-agnostic
prototypes as:

	BinarySearch(T)([], T)
	BinarySearch(T)([], T, IComparer(T))
	BinarySearch(T)([], Int32, T, IComparer(T))

In short, I prefer the current monodoc Members view.

Given that, what's a decent language-agnostics way to show class members
AND method prototypes?  If we follow the .NET 3.5 () lead, we'd get
AsReadOnly(T)(T[]), which really helps no one.

So we either pick a language, e.g. C# (as we currently do), generating
AsReadOnly&lt;T&gt;(T[]), or we pick some other set of &quot;enclosing&quot; characters
to contain type parameters, e.g. (requires UTF-8):

	AsReadOnly&#12300;T&#12301;(T[]) : ReadOnlyCollection&#12300;T&#12301;

(using U+300C and U+300D to &quot;quote&quot; the type parameters), or maybe
re-use [] (I believe Nemerle does this):

	AsReadOnly[T](T[]) : ReadOnlyCollection[T]

In short, we have a trade-off between a more useful (as far as I'm
concerned) &quot;show all overloads in the Members page&quot; AND use a sensible
set of characters to distinguish between type paramters and actual
parameters, vs. a more language-agnostic &quot;only show the Member name, and
display overloads in a separate page,&quot; and in the separate page use ()
to enclose *both* type parameters AND method parameters.
