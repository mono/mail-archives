To be fair, current output would be:

	&lt;Type Name=&quot;Test`1&quot; DisplayName=&quot;Test&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&quot; /&gt;

i.e. an added Type/@DisplayName attribute.

&gt;<i> 	  &lt;/Namespace&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 	&lt;/Types&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 	....
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Test`1.xml (Note that the the filename and name of the type are already
</I>&gt;<i> different):
</I>
Necessary, actually, because '&lt;' and '&gt;' are not valid filename
characters on Win32. :-)

&gt;<i> 	&lt;Type Name=&quot;Test&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&quot; FullName=&quot;Test.Test.Test&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 	...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But then again it seems that the browser uses the Test&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;
</I>&gt;<i> everywhere. Sometimes it gets parsed and will be displayed as Test&lt;T&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> but other times not and some ugly HTML-Entities are being shown as the
</I>&gt;<i> class name.
</I>
These are bugs in the doc browser and should be fixed.

&gt;<i> To streamline all these naming issues my proposal is to use the Test`1
</I>&gt;<i> Notation everywhere to be more coherent with the output of Type.Name and
</I>&gt;<i> not to introduce too much C#-Notations into the docs since Mono can be
</I>&gt;<i> used from a couple of languages.
</I>
I don't like this idea, mostly because e.g. Dictionary`2 is wildly
undescriptive.  Even Microsoft doesn't do this; instead, they do
&quot;Dictionary Generic Class&quot; for the .NET 2.0 docs, and (more sensibly)
&quot;Dictionary(TKey,TValue) Generic Class&quot; for the .NET 3.5 docs.

We could go the .NET 3.5 approach for the DisplayName attribute if you
care that much. :-)

But I really don't want to do Dictionary`2 because it's wrong.  Most
people don't know what &quot;`2&quot; is going to mean, it's ugly, and losing the
&quot;TKey, TValue&quot; part is a loss of some nice information.

&gt;<i> Generic Methods are also stored in the fancy &quot;Method&amp;lt;T&amp;gt&quot; way while
</I>&gt;<i> the Name returned by the corresponding MethodInfo would just be
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Method&quot;. Here I would also alter the Name to be compliant with the
</I>&gt;<i> output of MethodInfo, otherwise different generic overloads won't be
</I>&gt;<i> recognized as an overload (See Console.Write for example)
</I>
Generic methods use &quot;Method&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&quot; because that's what the ECMA
documentation does.  I did this for consistency, as the monodoc XML
format is based on the ECMA XML format.

&gt;<i> The changes in monodocer should be pretty easy to do (probably less 20
</I>&gt;<i> lines of code). However I haven't yet tested how the rest of the
</I>&gt;<i> documentation stack will react. Any comments on that?
</I>
You have a point that &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; are rather C# specific, so
following .NET 3.5 and using '(' and ')' might be an acceptable
compromise (again, if you care that much; personally, I don't have a
problem with using '&lt;' and '&gt;').  For reasons stated above, I do NOT wnt
to use Foo`N notation in the shell.

Furthermore, since you can &quot;overload&quot; types based on the number of
generic type parameters, not using &lt;&gt;/()/[]/etc. to enclose type
parameters either results in name ambiguities (if you only show what's
before the '`', as .NET 2.0 docs do), or requires the use of `N
notation.  Consider:

	delegate R Func&lt;R&gt; ();
	delegate R Func&lt;R,P&gt; (P p);
	delegate R Func&lt;R,P1,P2&gt; (P1 p1, P2 p2);

Which results in Func`1, Func`2, and Func`3, vs. Func&lt;R&gt;, Func&lt;R,P&gt;, and
Func&lt;R,P1,P2&gt; (or replace &lt;&gt; with () or something else).  I find the
latter far preferable.
