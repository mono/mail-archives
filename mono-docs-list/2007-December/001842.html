After looking into this further, I *think* this is a GTKHTML rendering
bug.

What I -- and most people -- expect to happen when &quot;&amp;lt;&quot; is used in
HTML is for '&lt;' to be rendered instead.  (After all, it *is* the escape
character for '&lt;'.)

However, GTKHTML only occasionally does this replacement -- when the
&amp;lt; is NOT part of a link.  If it's used within an &lt;a/&gt; tag (either the
href attribute or the text itself) &amp;lt; is NOT replaced with '&lt;'.

You can see this via `monodoc 'M:System.Array.AsReadOnly&lt;T&gt;'` -- the
page title is correct (&quot;System.Array.AsReadOnly&lt;T&gt; Method&quot;), as is the
method prototype and inline text such as the &quot;IList&lt;T&gt;&quot; in the Remarks
section, but any instances of &amp;lt; that are part of a link are NOT
properly translated.  I think it's GTKHTML because `monodoc --html`
doesn't have e.g. &quot;&amp;amp;lt;&quot; for &amp;lt; within links, but just &amp;lt;, and
monodoc still displays &quot;&amp;lt;&quot; instead of '&lt;'.

This is bad, because it makes the most important pieces of text -- the
links -- look wrong.

I think when I first worked on Generics support in monodoc I was using
Gecko; unfortunately, it crashes instantly now, so that's not really an
option.

Furthermore, clicking on a link containing &amp;lt; results in a Url
containing &amp;lt;, which (as mentioned elsewhere) the monodoc engine
doesn't like -- it expects &lt;&gt; to be used.

I've just committed a fix to docbrowser so that GtkHtmlRenderer will
&quot;correct&quot; the URLs before it sends them to the core, so at least you can
now click on links to Generic types/methods and actually go somewhere,
but the rendering is still wrong, and I don't know how to fix that short
of fixing GTKHTML (argh!) or switching to Gecko (crash!).
