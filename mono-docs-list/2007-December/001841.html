</I>
That's what I've been thinking. Just to override MemberFormatter and
then using Mono.Addins to check at runtime which derived classes are
available to use them to generate the signatures.

Missing dependencies should not be a problem we would just have to ship
Mono.Addins and a couple of stock Formatters with monodoc. If users want
to use a different formatter they could add a additional addin into some
~/.config folder and Mono.Addins could load and use them as well.

This would be a pretty easy solution to enable multiple signatures
however this has the limitation that signatures are only created during
the creation of the documentation.

&gt;<i> What would make more sense -- though I have no idea how easy this would
</I>&gt;<i> be -- is to alter the docbrowser to use Mono.Addins and have an XML -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> signature addin for each language.  We'd likely need to extend the XML
</I>&gt;<i> syntax further -- we have a &lt;TypeParameter/&gt; element but it's only used
</I>&gt;<i> at class level, and it should likely be inserted at member level as well
</I>&gt;<i> for generic methods -- but this would allow users to install addins on
</I>&gt;<i> their local machine and have the XML signatures translated &quot;on-the-fly&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> to their desired language.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The downside is that the XML contains C#-formatted type names (see other
</I>&gt;<i> message for reasons why this won't change), so this effectively requires
</I>&gt;<i> a C# -&gt; language translator as well in some circumstances, but for the
</I>&gt;<i> basics of member name, method parameters, type parameters, etc., this is
</I>&gt;<i> all readily extractable from the XML.
</I>
I don't know much about how the browser parses his data but this is also
an alternative worth investigating. I'll probably look into both if I
have the time.

Kind Regards,
Valentin
