Continuing with this logic...

I've done a little more thinking about this.

First thought: what do other documentation tools do?

Alas, I only know of devhelp (anyone know what the Qt equivalent is?).

What's devhelp do?

Documentation is in e.g. /usr/share/gtk-doc, and each directory found
under there becomes a toplevel node in the devhelp treenode.

This works, but I don't think it will scale well.  For example, on my
(anemic) machine, devhelp has 7 libraries installed (i.e. 7 nodes in the
tree view by default), while monodoc has 12, and that's with some stuff
&quot;collapsed&quot; that would otherwise be toplevel nodes in devhelp (e.g.
&quot;Mono Libraries/Cairo&quot; would likely be a toplevel in devhelp, as would
&quot;Various/NUnit Libraries&quot; and everything else under Various).

So I don't really like the devhelp solution, as it's solution to
&quot;structure&quot; is to provide nearly no structure at all.

&gt;<i> Which brings us to the final question: is allowing external
</I>&gt;<i> documentation teams to specify their documentation location (within the
</I>&gt;<i> GUI tree) a good idea at all?  The possible problem is that there won't
</I>&gt;<i> be any &quot;structure&quot; to the documentation, as docs could be placed
</I>&gt;<i> anywhere/everywhere within the tree view, potentially making it more
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to find things.
</I>...
&gt;<i> So perhaps instead of making the tree uber-extensible, we should instead

</I>&gt;<i> monodoc.xml is the sole source of the toplevel nodes in the treeview --

</I>&gt;<i> tree view is effectively unstructured as every project decides that
</I>&gt;<i> they're important enough to be toplevel nodes...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So perhaps this structure would be a good start:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   - Libraries
</I>&gt;<i>     - Base Class Library
</I>&gt;<i>       - [Namespace List -- System, etc.]
</I>&gt;<i>     - Gnome Libraries
</I>&gt;<i>     - Mono Libraries
</I>&gt;<i>     - Mozilla Libraries
</I>&gt;<i>     - ...
</I>&gt;<i>   - Languages
</I>&gt;<i>     - C#
</I>&gt;<i>       - C# Language Specification
</I>&gt;<i>       - C# Error Reference
</I>&gt;<i>     - [ Nemerle, Boo, etc. ]
</I>&gt;<i>   - Testing
</I>&gt;<i>     - NUnit
</I>&gt;<i>     - [ MbUnit, etc. ]
</I>&gt;<i>   - Programs [ or Tools? ]
</I>&gt;<i>     - MonoDevelop IDE
</I>&gt;<i>     - Mono Utilities
</I>&gt;<i>       - [man pages]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The point being that if we can make the toplevel nodes sufficiently high
</I>&gt;<i> level, we (hopefully) won't need 3rd parties to be able to place nodes
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;anywhere&quot;, as there is already a well-designed place for them to insert
</I>&gt;<i> themselves.
</I>
And the problem with this is the current implementation -- *.source
files specify their *parent* node, which (1) obviously must exist, and
(2) is the _parent_ node.  So if we changed e.g.
$prefix/lib/monodoc/sources/Mono.source to contain:

        &lt;source provider=&quot;ecma&quot; basefile=&quot;Mono&quot; path=&quot;classlib&quot;/&gt;

(1) is satisfied (&quot;classlib&quot; exists as the Libraries node), but because
of (2) all of the Mono.* namespaces will show up as direct children of
Libraries, intermixed with all the children of System.*, Novell.*,
Cairo.*, and everything else.

So much for structure.  We'd get something worse than devhelp!

What I think is necessary is an extension to the *.source format: in
addition to /monodoc/source, we could permit a /monodoc/node element
(with the same semantics as in monodoc.xml), with the following changes:

1. /monodoc/node element (i.e. toplevel //node element) would require a
@parent attribute, which would be the parent node of the specified node.
If no @parent is provided, it would be ignored.

2. All //node elements from $libdir/monodoc/sources/*.sources would be
&quot;merged&quot; with the //node elements within $libdir/monodoc/monodoc.xml at
runtime.  Two nodes with the same //node/@name attribute value would be
the same node.  //node/@label is not used for equality purposes.

If no node matching the /monodoc/source/@path value is found, it would
be inserted underneath a default Various node.

This would allow a $libdir/monodoc/monodoc.xml file of:

        &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
        &lt;node label=&quot;Mono Documentation&quot; name=&quot;root:&quot;&gt;
          &lt;node label=&quot;Libraries&quot; name=&quot;classlib&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;node label=&quot;Languages&quot; name=&quot;languages&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;node label=&quot;Testing&quot; name=&quot;testing&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;node label=&quot;Tools&quot; name=&quot;tools&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;node label=&quot;Various&quot; name=&quot;various&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/node&gt;

$libdir/monodoc/sources/Mono.source would become:

        &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
        &lt;monodoc&gt;
          &lt;node label=&quot;Mono Libraries&quot; name=&quot;classlib-mono&quot;
            parent=&quot;classlib&quot; /&gt;
          &lt;source provider=&quot;ecma&quot; basefile=&quot;Mono&quot; path=&quot;classlib-mono&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/monodoc&gt;

And more &quot;complicated&quot; nesting could be done to support multiple levels
of nesting, e.g. cs-errors.source:

        &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
        &lt;monodoc&gt;
          &lt;node label=&quot;C#&quot; name=&quot;lang-c#&quot; parent=&quot;languages&quot;&gt;
            &lt;node label=&quot;C# Compiler Error Reference&quot; name=&quot;cs-errors&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;/node&gt;
          &lt;source provider=&quot;error&quot; basefile=&quot;cs-errors&quot;
        path=&quot;cs-errors&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/monodoc&gt;

and ecma334.source:

        &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
        &lt;monodoc&gt;
        &#65279;  &lt;node label=&quot;C#&quot; name=&quot;lang-c#&quot; parent=&quot;languages&quot;&gt;
            &lt;node label=&quot;C# Language Specification&quot; name=&quot;ecmaspec&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;/node&gt;
          &lt;source provider=&quot;ecmaspec&quot; basefile=&quot;ecma334&quot;
        path=&quot;ecmaspec&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/monodoc&gt;

Which would generate the /Languages/C#/C# Language Spec etc. nodes from
the quotation above.

This would allow a basic level of structure to be provided (Libraries,
Testing, Tools, etc.), while allowing each .source file to provide
additional structure in a reasonable manner, while the entire treeview
is built at runtime.

New toplevel nodes could even be added by using &quot;root:&quot; as the @parent
node (though this should be discouraged).

Now, I haven't actually written any code to do this, just trying to
think/feel things out here, but does this sound sane/reasonable?  Would
this clear up the packaging issues that were originally eluded to?  Is
anything missing?

Thanks,
 - Jon
