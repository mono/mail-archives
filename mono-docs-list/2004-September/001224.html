<PRE>Hi Charles.

I cannot help you to install monodoc on windows. But if you install mono
from the installer it should be not much difficult (if is not embedded
inside) to build it yourself

I think everything is important just tell what are you be working on so
nobody will overlap with your work...

In my opinion is very important supply with examples so everybody can
suppose how it's intended to work.

I still have problems uploading my contributions so maybe you will have
the same problem. Fawad told me to just post my contributions to this
mail list. Someone will upload it for you.

I think you can look at MS SDK whenever you want but it's better to make
your contributions on your own. This way nobody will reclaim copyright
rights.

I announce:
	I'm working intensively with Database access with Mysql and MSsql so
I'm updating those sections a lot. I'll post here my contributions (full
of examples) soon if server is not still fixed.

Is there anyone working on this?


&gt;<i> I really want to contribute to the docs for Mono. Iÿve got a couple of
</I>&gt;<i> questions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      1. How do I get monodoc running on windows?
</I>&gt;<i>      2. Is there anything in particular that urgently needs
</I>&gt;<i>         documentation written for it?
</I>&gt;<i>      3. Is there anything wrong in looking at the Microsoft SDK
</I>&gt;<i>         documentation and using it as a base for what I write for the
</I>&gt;<i>         Mono docs?
</I>&gt;<i>
