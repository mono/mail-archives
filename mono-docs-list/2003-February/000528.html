Thanks for the s/#/.Net/g.  :) I told you I'd provide feedback on your
first draft and dropped the ball.  Sorry about that. Thanks again for
working on this documentation. 

Now for the comments. First a general comment.  If you try to do a &quot;this
is how to write object-oriented programs by splitting things up into
classes and separate files&quot; type of document, you're going to end up
with a monstrously long document that anyone who's read a C# or Java
book is going to find redundant.

That said, here's my back-seat driver, &quot;this is how I would structure
this document if I were writing it&quot; feedback. :)

First Pass:  just like your first try.  Focus on Programs and App
windows.  That's a nice high level overview of the main loop and the
toplevel window for a GNOME.Net app.

Second pass:  I would combine your second and third try apps into one,
but restructure it as displayed in the attached file.

Things to highlight would be the subclassing of Gnome.App, which is a
more meaningful example in that it implements the DeleteEvent handler on
the Object that exposes DeleteEvent. Obviously, the implementation of
DeleteEventHandler, and the handling of the RetVal in delete_event are
other points of focus.  

I don't think anything is really gained by subclassing Gnome.Program.
The only reason I can think of to subclass Program in an application
would be to add complex or lengthy argument handling.

4th and 5th tries as I indicated above would go away, since they aren't
really specific to programming in GNOME.Net. If you wanted to go beyond
the second pass example, I would suggest doing something like packing an
Entry, Label, and Button into an App window such that when the button is
clicked, the Label is updated to: &quot;Hello &lt;contents of Entry&gt;, welcome to
GNOME.Net.  That's not really GNOME specific though, and is probably
better suited for an extended Gtk# example.
