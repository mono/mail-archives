</I>Ok.
&gt;<i> &gt; The hack is meant to allow use to map the name of a provider (eg,

</I>Well, we have the following tree:

Mono Documentation root:
|<i>-Class Library root:/classlib
</I>...

We need to be able to map the name &quot;classlib&quot; to the instance of
EcmaProvider which represents that, so that it can render the URL.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   The changes to populate are also very bizarre, can you explain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; what they are for?  (They reference root:)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Before, each node below Mono Documentation had a url such as &quot;classlib&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; now they have &quot;root:/classlib&quot;. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, and what is that used for?
</I>This gives the nodes the urls root:/classlib so that we can see them.

The best way to understand why I made these patches for web monodoc is
to try it out, you can see which pages are the root:/classlib like urls,
and why we need them for navigation.
