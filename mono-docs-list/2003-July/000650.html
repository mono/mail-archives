Hello,

Thanks.

</I>
I'm including a slightly revised and hopefully more robust version
of the CGI script. It will refuse any query containing characters 
that can't come up in a MonoDoc URL. AFAIK this should be safe, but
I'd certainly like to have a peer opinion before removing the &quot;not for
production&quot; sign.

Also, monodoc itself needs to treat the passed URL sensibly, which at 
the moment I can only assume it is doing.

&gt;<i> I do not have a particular preference over using the XSLT inside
</I>&gt;<i> Monodoc, or outside Monodoc.  The approach suggest by Joshua minimizes
</I>&gt;<i> the code we have to maintain in browser.cs, so that is a plus.  The
</I>&gt;<i> downside is that it is not as self-contained as what we have now.
</I>
I'd favor using the Mono Xslt processor at the very least. I for one 
don't have XML::LibXSLT installed, it just seems that using it would 
add up useless dependencies (a similar case could be made for not 
using Perl in the first place :) ).

To alleviate increasing the complexity in browser.cs, I propose adding
a separate class to generate www output. It will still add code to
maintain in the browser.exe assembly, but perhaps make it a bit cleaner.

I'll email the new version a bit later (in diff -u format ;) ), after
that if all agree let me know if and how I can commit the code...

&gt;<i> You mean the tree view on the right?  You might want to look at the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;dump.cs&quot; program in Monodoc which is a simple program to dump the
</I>&gt;<i> tree.
</I>
That was what I meant, thanks.
