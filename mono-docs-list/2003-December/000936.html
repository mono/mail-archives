<PRE>Hello!

&gt;<i> Hello, this is my first post to this list (which I've
</I>&gt;<i> been reading for only very few days).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm writing because yesterday I contirbuted a small
</I>&gt;<i> code sample using monodoc's integrated upload
</I>&gt;<i> function, and I'd like to know how is this going to be
</I>&gt;<i> processed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is it first queued waiting to be approved? Is it
</I>&gt;<i> automatically posted somewere on the web, or on some
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list? How can I be assured the contribution
</I>&gt;<i> isn't lost? How can I download the latest version of
</I>&gt;<i> monodoc information, so I have the most recent
</I>&gt;<i> documentation at hand?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I home these aren't too many questions.
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your help.
</I>
These are good questions.

The monodoc contributions are processed by me currently, since the tool
to merge the changes is kind of primitive (you can see it in
monodoc/browser/admin.cs) so I can work around the various buglets it
might have.

As the tool evolves, I would not mind giving more &quot;admin&quot; privileges to
people to approve contributions, but right now its too buggy, too
unstable, and is missing too many features.

I will try to process some of the contributions tomorrow (we got quite a
few!).

About the documentation: I think we would have to make new releases of
the documentation with the updates for them to be useful, I am not sure
how often I will make one, its something we can discuss.

Miguel.
