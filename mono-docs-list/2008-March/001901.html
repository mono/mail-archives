I guess my main question would be, why?  It doesn't save boxing
overhead, since Node is a reference type, right?  Seems like
considerable pain to avoid typing 'as Node' occasionally.

Unless the generics usage is necessary for a feature addition to a
consumer of the dll, I don't see the justification for breaking
stability.

In order to do it, you would need to install a new assembly version into
the GAC, and probably make a monodoc-2.0.pc which is
parallel-installable to the old version.

If we are really going to end up with two separate dlls, we probably
ought to spec out what we need for features in a new &quot;engine&quot; dll, and
implement them in as clean as possible a codebase.

For example, my new editor/viewer could probably benefit from an engine
node that exposes raw XML.  The current system is all about returning
html for obvious reasons.

I just don't see the real benefit in having a dual assembly setup if the
only difference between the versions is a little C# 2.0 sugar.
