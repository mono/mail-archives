I have some good news and some bad news.

The good news is that SVN does support the equivalent of CVS Ampersand
directory modules, which mono-tools was using.  The SVN equivalent is
the &quot;svn:externals&quot; property on a module directory.

See: <A HREF="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch07s03.html">http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch07s03.html</A>

The bad news is that this isn't *exactly* the same.  In particular, the
svn:externals property contains a name/value pair of directories to
checkout into, and the fully-qualified URL of a versioned resource.  The
problem is it *must* be fully-qualified, which may be a problem since we
have two public SVN URLs: the URL for developers at mono-cvs.ximian.com,
and the URL for everyone else at mono.myrealbox.com.

For now I've added a svn:externals definition for type-reflector
pointing to mono.myrealbox.com.  Pro: this allows everyone to checkout
mono-tools and at least see type-reflector (I didn't re-add debugger);
Con: developers won't be able to actually edit any files within type-
reflector -- they'll have have manually checkout type-reflector
separately to make any changes to it.

Whether svn:externals is the way to move forward is certainly debatable.
It may be better to just move the existing projects into mono-tools, and
not give them separate directories as well.
