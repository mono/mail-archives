I'm recompiling Monodoc from svn right now; I'll see if that's 
the solution to my problems.

</I>
Sure. I've been evaluating what was in html/ and only moving to new/
the organization/content that looks useful to hold onto for the future.

My major area of work right now is evaluating the docs for the Gtk#
bindings and expanding them. I've also more or less finished
the XML docs in gtk-sharp/doc/en/Gtk. There are a few loose ends,
mostly marked by &quot;XXX&quot;, &quot;FIXME&quot;, or &quot;TODO&quot;.

&gt;<i> And does anyone else find a &quot;new&quot; directory somewhat &quot;weird&quot;?  Will
</I>&gt;<i> there be any future migration to another directory, or are we sticking
</I>&gt;<i> with the &quot;new&quot; directory for now?
</I>
I'd like to rename it, I just hadn't settled on something besides
&quot;new&quot; yet and I didn't want to obliterate html/ if it was still being
used for something. I suggest &quot;handbook&quot;, with html/ to be removed
from the trunk within a few days, once I've confirmed that the
really useful stuff there has been moved over.
