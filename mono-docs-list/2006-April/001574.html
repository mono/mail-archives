Hey,

Thanks for resending it as a patch.

So, what you have will use the DescriptionAttribute for members, but not
for types.  The attribute can be applied to types, but I don't know
whether it's used that way in practice../?

It would be good to put what you wrote in the MakeDocNode method (the
main one), which is where the summary nodes are created anyway for both
types and members.  The problem is that MakeDocNode doesn't have a
reference to the member/type being documented, so what you'd want to do
is add a parameter of type ICustomAttributeProvider to that method
(types and members all implement from that), and then fix up the callers
to pass the thing down.  Somehow it got a little more difficult.

The problem with doing that is that (if/)when we eventually switch to
Cecil instead of Reflection, the patch isn't going to reapply nicely to
the Cecil version I un-committed, so the changes may have to be redone...
