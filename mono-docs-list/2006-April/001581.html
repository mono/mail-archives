<PRE>Some very good points. Most of have a hard time seeing the site from the
prospective of a newbie. I myself hard a hard time trying to think of a
better flow, and at one point was going to start a new site external to
mono to help organize the documentation (before we moved to wiki). 

Now with the wiki, we should be able to work something out, maybe under
a testing user space (like &quot;/new/Articles&quot; and &quot;/new/Docs&quot;), and when a
viable solution seems to work, we can migrate those back to the main
pages. 

Also as much as like the new theme for artistic design, its not a useful
as it could be. 

If you break it down you have 
	* Start
	* Use
	* Contribute

in one area and then:

	* Screenshots
	* Download Now
	* Manuals and Docs
	* Blogs (Offsite link)

Well manuals and docs overlap in concept with Start and Use. Start is
ambiguous. Maybe something like &quot;About&quot; or &quot;FAQs&quot; or &quot;Getting Started&quot;.
Really something like that should be a link on the home page or maybe a
sub-link on a list of FAQs or about section. 

Because its wiki, we have some major flexibility, but it means we might
need to change the main template to work it in. 

I have a lot of ideas that would be good to get down, maybe even make
some mock ups under my userspace on the wiki. I feel the same way, the
current system doesn't flow very well and needs some major rethinking.

</I>&gt;<i> articles by domain of application. The Article link on the main page
</I>&gt;<i> is like &quot;it's kind of something not important&quot; but it's really
</I>&gt;<i> important! So, that's what I propose.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (1) When we click on &quot;Manuals and docs&quot;, we go to the page &quot;Manuals and docs&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> (2) On the top right of this page, a link to the API doc
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/docs/">http://www.go-mono.com/docs/</A>).
</I>&gt;<i> (3) On the top left of this page, a link to the Monkeyguide
</I>&gt;<i> (4) In the content section of this page, articles organized by domain
</I>&gt;<i> of application
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think It's more coherent and newbies won't be lost.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It was the first point. Now, the second point: translations.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would be really good to propose articles/howtos translations
</I>&gt;<i> directly on the website just after the article/howto link, so like
</I>&gt;<i> this: &quot;Hello World!&quot; in Gtk# [english - spanish - french] and inciting
</I>&gt;<i> people to contribute directly on the website. So like that, when
</I>&gt;<i> someone will want to write an article/howto on their personal
</I>&gt;<i> website/project, they just will have to check if the article already
</I>&gt;<i> exists and why not to officially link their article/howto in this
</I>&gt;<i> section if it doesn't talk about an existing subject yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Voila :) I say it again, it's only my point of view so very
</I>&gt;<i> subjective. I'm ready to contribute if you wish.
</I>&gt;<i>
