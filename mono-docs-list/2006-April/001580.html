<PRE>Hello everyone!

My name is Gilles, I'm 23 years-old and I actually live in France (I'm
going to move to Australia pretty soon). I'm a Mono Lover. Thanks to
the team and contributors for all your work.

Well, it's just my point of view. I really don't like the structure of
the official website concerning documentation. Imagine I'm a newbie. I
downloaded Mono and I would like to program my first application to
understand how Mono works. I click on &quot;Manuals and docs&quot; in the top
right and boom! I have before my eyes an &quot;expert&quot; documentation. I'm
just a newbie! Wow! Too many libraries! It's really cool but I'm lost!
I know that I can program a GUI application with Gtk# but how to do?
If I click on &quot;Gnome Libraries&quot; and &quot;Gtk&quot;, I find tones of classes but
I absolutely don't know how to use them. So, I return to the main page
and the only one link which sounds good to me is &quot;Articles&quot;. I click
on this link and on the Articles page, titles are organized by date of
publication. It's not coherent. It would be better to organize
articles by domain of application. The Article link on the main page
is like &quot;it's kind of something not important&quot; but it's really
important! So, that's what I propose.

(1) When we click on &quot;Manuals and docs&quot;, we go to the page &quot;Manuals and docs&quot;
(2) On the top right of this page, a link to the API doc
(<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/docs/">http://www.go-mono.com/docs/</A>).
(3) On the top left of this page, a link to the Monkeyguide
(4) In the content section of this page, articles organized by domain
of application

I think It's more coherent and newbies won't be lost.

It was the first point. Now, the second point: translations.

It would be really good to propose articles/howtos translations
directly on the website just after the article/howto link, so like
this: &quot;Hello World!&quot; in Gtk# [english - spanish - french] and inciting
people to contribute directly on the website. So like that, when
someone will want to write an article/howto on their personal
website/project, they just will have to check if the article already
exists and why not to officially link their article/howto in this
section if it doesn't talk about an existing subject yet.

Voila :) I say it again, it's only my point of view so very
subjective. I'm ready to contribute if you wish.

Regards,
Gilles
