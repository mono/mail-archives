I've had a look at the GDK code for win32 and it doesn't look like
gdk_gc_set_subwindow (GDK_INCLUDE_INFERIORS) is supported.

So glade-2 shouldn't work on win32 either. Can someone check that?

I think I may have to rewrite it to avoid using gdk_gc_set_subwindow().
Each time it gets an expose signal it will queue an idle function which
will draw all the selection rectangles that intersect the window that
got the expose event. It will be a bit more complicated than the current
code, but shouldn't be too bad.
