<PRE>Hi Damon, Joaquin and others!

Let me first say that it's great to see these fast paced improvements to
glade3, I'm just so sorry that at the moment I have no time to help
significatively :(
I'll try at least to test and report some bugs in bugzilla.

IMHO the positions should not be hardcoded and if they do not appear in
useful positions I'd consider that a bug in the WM... in practice
however it may make sense.
To save the window positions all the other apps I know of use gconf, but
we currently do not depend on it.

&gt;<i>  o The GNOME HIG says that exit buttons shouldn't be on the toolbar.

</I>
Agreed, I also think that a &quot;New&quot; button is pretty standard in editing
apps... there's a bug in bugzilla about this.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  o I don't think the property editor or widget tree should have their
</I>&gt;<i>    type hint set to GDK_WINDOW_TYPE_HINT_UTILITY. That makes them
</I>&gt;<i>    always-on-top, but they are too big and get in the way.
</I>
Agreed.

&gt;<i>  o I think the dialogs for setting up widgets (e.g. table rows/cols)
</I>&gt;<i>    should appear where the mouse is, not the middle of the screen.
</I>
I'm not convinced about this... I'd find it more intuitive if it
appeared positioned over the widget it refers to.


&gt;<i> If noone objects, I can do all these.
