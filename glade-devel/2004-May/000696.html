As a matter of fact my comment was of the kind &quot;In an ideal
world...&quot; ;-)
What I don't like much is the hardcoding of the positions... how that
play with different resolutions, xinerama, etc?

Anyway I think this is a non-issue if we are ok addind a gconf dep (and
hopefully have similar capability on Windows): the user would have to
place the windows to his taste just the first time, then the position he
used are stored for next times.

By the way, do you think we also should store which tools he currently
has open (for instance if he hid the editor and showed the project tree
view) or should we always start with the palette and the editor on and
with the project view and the clipboard off?


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  o I think the dialogs for setting up widgets (e.g. table rows/cols)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;    should appear where the mouse is, not the middle of the screen.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not convinced about this... I'd find it more intuitive if 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it appeared positioned over the widget it refers to.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That can be hard, as the widget has not yet been created when you show this
</I>&gt;<i> dialog box.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Yep... for vboxes etc placing at the mouse pointer would work ok since
you just clicked where you want to place the widget. I was thinking
about the GtkDialog widget: in that case the mouse pointer is over the
palette. Oh well, I'm fine either way.
