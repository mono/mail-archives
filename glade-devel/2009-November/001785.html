Yes, I was in fact aware of the fact that I had not used any gnome-specific
code. So I cannot really explain to myself why the glade 2 GUI builder had
placed the &lt;requires lib=&quot;gnome&quot;/&gt; XML element in the XML file but I
guess glade 2 is history now so it's probably not worth fixing such bug.

Actually the reason might seem to be the fact that I have used some
gnome icons in the glade 2 XML file despite not using any actual widgets.
Here are the gnome icons from the glade 2 XML file which I seem to have
been using (seem like these icons correspond to the stock property):

stock property:
gnome-stock-text-numbered-list
gnome-stock-multiple-file
gnome-stock-mail-new
gnome-stock-about
gnome-stock-book-blue
gnome-stock-book-yellow
gnome-stock-book-red
gnome-stock-book-green

So, I'm not sure what the corresponding icons would be in
the most recent Gtk icons if any at all. But I guess this is
what I need to fix. Otherwise can I not just simply copy
these gnome icons to my source code tree and somehow
import them into glade-3 from there?

Otherwise what should I do? Should I just delete these lines
to get it to work? Because right now despite deleting the
&lt;requires lib=&quot;gnome&quot;/&gt; tag I still get the segmentation
fault.

Plus I just don't understand what these complaints about
GnomeDateEdit which I don't see used within the glade 2
file are. And the names of the icons from the warnings do
not appear inside the glade 2 file either. I am confused.

I guess 4034 is just an error code (apart from the segfault).

To fix the horizontalness, I'm not sure if someone attached a script
&gt;<i> to the bug that does that (since your file is considerably large and
</I>&gt;<i> a PITA to fix by hand), fixing it by hand means fixing the orientation
</I>&gt;<i> property of each vbox/vpaned etc in the project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yeah, maybe a script is needed, but since I don't really understand what
the replacements should be I am also not sure about how to write such
script.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I got a bunch of errors from CList, seems support for CList somehow
</I>&gt;<i> got broken in Glade, however your file still seems to load and save ok,
</I>&gt;<i> Im not sure whats going on with your CList children (ofcourse you will
</I>&gt;<i> have to drop deprecated GtkCList anyway to move on to GtkBuilder).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
So what do I use in place of GtkCList or CList?


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In terms of litterature I think there is not much, its better for you to
</I>&gt;<i> stick with some tutorials, reference manuals, the source and irc I
</I>&gt;<i> would think.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Thank, I will have a look at these as well, but what other modifications
did you make to the glade file to get it to work?

Thanks,
