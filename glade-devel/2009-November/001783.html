OK so that might as well mean that I can uninstall libglade
completely from my Ubuntu 9.04 Linux system.


&gt;<i> You dont need a conversion tool to load a file created

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You will encounter a bug where everything seems horizontally

</I>&gt;<i> old version, it wont output the orientation property needed
</I>&gt;<i> to tell VBoxes that they need to be vertical, sorry about that).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Too bad this could not have been fixed in the code.
 What are the reasons for it not working out of the box?
Are there some widget property incompatibilities?


&gt;<i> libgnomeui is an old library that does lots of gnome specific
</I>&gt;<i> stuff, it pulls in lots of dependencies you dont want to build
</I>&gt;<i> nowadays and most of the widgets if not all, have equal
</I>&gt;<i> coverage in GTK+ by now (i.e. its another old and deprecated
</I>&gt;<i> widget library).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
OK so it looks like I will be uninstalling libgnomeui as well.
I never liked the idea of gnome-specific widgets which cannot
then be ported to other platforms anyway.

You can at least start by loading the file in Glade, fixing
&gt;<i> the orientation property where you need to (search vbox
</I>&gt;<i> in the search entry should help), then convert it to GtkBuilder
</I>&gt;<i> (use the project preferences dialog) and see what deprecated
</I>&gt;<i> widgets dissapear in the conversion - should give you an idea
</I>&gt;<i> of what widget types you need to replace to move on to GtkBuilder.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Looks like I am going to have to learn how to use GtkBuilder
to port my C code which worked with glade 2 code to C code
that works with glade 3.

Well, when I try to open the file <A HREF="http://whm.sf.net/foo.glade">http://whm.sf.net/foo.glade</A>
with glade-2 I am successful but with glade-3 I get a
segmentation fault:

Obviously something needs to be done for me to be able to open the
file with glade-3, but I am not sure exactly what. Any ideas?

APART FROM THIS...

By the way, is the book &quot;The Official Gnome 2 Developer's Guide&quot;
as in the links appearing below now an outdated book?

<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&amp;linkCode=qs&amp;keywords=1593270305">http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&amp;linkCode=qs&amp;keywords=1593270305</A>
<A HREF="http://developer.novell.com/wiki/index.php/The_Official_Gnome_2_Developer%27s_Guide">http://developer.novell.com/wiki/index.php/The_Official_Gnome_2_Developer%27s_Guide</A>

Is there better more up-to-date books on Gtk/Glib/Glade deve lopment
which are more relevant nowadays (given that as you mentioned the
development libraries are now more gnome-independent?)

Looks like nowadays the reference books on this subject are:

- Foundations of GTK+ Development (Expert's Voice in Open Source)
(Paperback)
  by Andrew Krause

and

-  Gtk+ Programming in C (Paperback)
  by Syd Logan

but I am not sure about whether any of these cover GtkBuilder and glade.

Any suggestions or recommendations on selecting a proper place
to work with are very welcome (I have used Gtk and Glib in the past
but now I am somewhat rusty on it and need something to go by in
order to upgrade properly),

Thank you for your help and feedback,
