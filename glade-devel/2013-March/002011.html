Hi,
  Just reiterating what I've said many times before,
the reason I don't want to go in the direction of GtkTreeView, is
that it treats widget properties like rows of data, this approach
limits our capability of providing more user friendly editors.

I would rather go in a direction where property editors see
more per-widget type customization (i.e. a GtkLabel editor
is different than a GtkButton editor), this let's us organize
the view in a more human friendly way.

I know, most of Glade's property editors don't leverage
the custom editor approach enough yet to justify this
approach (most of Glade's editors still look like a dumb
list of properties), but I think it's the right direction to
take in general, so I don't want to frame us into a corner
where editor customization becomes impossible.

Perhaps with the new dogfooding that we've been
doing this will be more easily achieved (i.e. Glades
main UI is made with Glade, hopefully the individual
property editors soon can also be made with Glade).

Cheers,
           -Tristan

PS: For a basic example of what I ultimately want,
I know it sucks to refer to OSX tooling /again/ but
here's a screen shot from Interface Builder:

<A HREF="http://disanji.net/iOS_Doc/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/URL_Tools_for_iPhone_OS_Development/Art/interface_builder.jpg">http://disanji.net/iOS_Doc/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/URL_Tools_for_iPhone_OS_Development/Art/interface_builder.jpg</A>

Notice the property editor on the right hand side,
the amount of properties exposed to the user are
limited to configuring &quot;things that matter&quot;, and
there is some interesting grouping of properties
going on... this kind of custom layouting is what
I really want to see more of in Glade, while the
core allows for this customization, it just hasn't
been leveraged enough yet to really look great.
