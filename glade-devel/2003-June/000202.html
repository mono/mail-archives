<PRE>Hello,


Here a two little bugs I've found in Glade 2.0.0.  They might seem a little cosmetic to some, but they're still problems which should be dealt with.  Here they are:


1.  When doing a &quot;make install&quot; of an existing project, pixmaps (from the &quot;&lt;projectname&gt;/pixmaps&quot; directory) are installed in &quot;/usr/local/share/pixmaps/&lt;projectname&gt;&quot;.  This is normal.  But when a &quot;make uninstall&quot; is performed (say, if somebody wants to uninstall &lt;projectname&gt;, the pixmaps are NOT removed from &quot;/usr/local/share/pixmaps/&lt;projectname&gt;&quot; and the &quot;&lt;projectname&gt;&quot; directory is NOT deleted from &quot;/usr/local/share/pixmaps&quot;.  This uses unnecessary disk space.

2.  After Glade 2.0.0 has been running for some time, when double-clicking on a certain window name in the main Glade 2.0.0 window, the clicked window does NOT appear (so it can be edited and worked on), as it was previously the case with Glade 0.6.4.  The user is forced to use the widget tree, right click on the desired window name and select &quot;redisplay&quot; to get the desired window to appear.  I can't figure out the exact conditions for this problem to show, but it seems to appear after many windows have been opened/closed several times.  If this can be of any help, I am using Enlightenment 0.16.5.


When replying, please CC: me to &quot;jeannot12 AT linuxmail DOT org&quot;, as I may not be subscribed to the Glade devel mailing list for long (web mail quotas are small... :-).

Thanks a lot for the great new Glade 2.0.0 release guys, I hope this report may help.


Have a nice day,
