</I>
I've committed the patch, but I've changed where the ref happens.

Now, we ref a widget &amp; the placeholder when we create/destroy/cut/paste
it.  That's, at the very beginning of the operation (as we're
referencing the widgets on cmd-&gt;widget &amp; cmd-&gt;placeholder).

When we destroy the operation, we unref them.

When we replace the widget with a new placeholder, then we ref the new
placeholder.

That's all.  This way we should be safe &amp; not leak.  At least it's
working here[TM], and it looks more natural than the current &quot;ops, we're
going to remove the widget from its parent, reference it now or it will
be destroyed&quot; :-)

P.S.: Paolo, am I still missing some of your patches, or this big patch
had everything?

Cheers,
