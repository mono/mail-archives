Then, I don't understand how all that works...

Let's see, I though that if you have an expose handler, you should draw
on the expose-&gt;window, which is the window that gdk creates just before
the expose event (the double buffered one).

The code was instead drawing on the widget-&gt;window (or on the window of
one ancestor).  This is the window that I called &quot;the GdkWindow of the
widget&quot;.  We were able to saw the nodes, just because we were not taking
in account the damaged region, and we were drawing at each expose the
whole rectangle with the nodes.  The damaged region will be redrawed
when the expose propagation ends with the double buffer (that we didn't
touch), and thus we saw the nodes everywhere except in the damaged
region.

So, am I on crack?  It makes sense for me, but I believe you much more
than myself on anything that concerns gtk.	

&gt;<i> and that applies to ::event-after as well.
</I>
I was not saying that event-after was different than expose, and it has
a quite long history.  To make it short, it was crack, and it's good to
see it gone.

Thank you for any explanation Owen, it's much appreciated!

Cheers,
