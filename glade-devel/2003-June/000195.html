Hi

Well I had been testing my undo/redo code for cut/paste a lot, as I wrote it. 
I haven't fixed it yet, but just thought I'd mention it to you guys. Try this 
out

Create window
Add a hbox
Add a button
Now cut and then paste 3 times the button
Now keep doing undo
When it is time to undo the first cut (thats the third time it is *supposed* to
show up again), it crashes. 

If you do do cut then paste 5 times and then keep undo-ing it, it again crashes
after 5 undo's. This is the problem I had been wanting to tell you guys. If
someone wants to try to debug it go ahead. I can only get back to this by July
(I should be home for the holidays then, away from college). And if you do
indeed trace it and fix, plz plz plz plz plz tell me how. Trying to track this
bug has been a pain to my relatively inexperinced gdb skils. 

HTH
