<PRE>Hi,

in Glade v3 it seems to be impossible to give two widgets the same
name, which was possible in Glade v2. Although it may sound strange
at first, it definitely is useful to have two widgets with the same
name in one file, e.g. for having several windows in 1 glade-file,
where each window has a &quot;close_button&quot; or a &quot;number_entry&quot;.
I used this a lot with Glade v2.

So, could you again (like in Glade v2) allow several widgets with the
same name in one file?

(The alternative for the example above would either be much longer widget-
names (plus specific code for every window, since generic code may not work)
or a whole bunch of glade-files---which both seems clumsy.)


regards,
Roland
