First, I wonder if you read my blog post[1] that describes how
loading your custom type can now be &quot;faked&quot; in the glade runtime,
this makes integrating custom widget types easier, and from 
the libglade point of view, loading a custom type is really only
a matter of calling glade_register_widget() before calling
glade_xml_new() (then again, maybe this is a little more difficult
when using gtkmm for some reason ?)

That being said, we put the old hacked out &quot;custom&quot; widget support
in the &quot;obsolete&quot; group because we believe better alternatives
exist now, I'm not really planning on removing that support
for old glade files though - maybe in some distant future.

&gt;<i> 2) Can I sell my Gtkmm program (with closed source) considering that
</I>&gt;<i> it loads .glade files and process it and that Glade is released under
</I>&gt;<i> GPL? The team I work for want this to happen.
</I>
Yes you can, the codebase is protected by GPL not the xml file :)
(note ofcourse libglade is distributed under LGPL)

Cheers,
                  -Tristan
