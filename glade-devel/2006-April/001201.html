Yes, I'm afraid GTK+ widgets aren't really intended to be stacked on top
of each other.

You might be able to use an rc file to set the background pixmap of the
layout/window instead of using an image widget. Though I'm not sure how
well that would work.

I think your best option is probably to write your own simple GUI
editing app, and use your own button widget that has transparency.
But you'd need to know GTK+ fairly well to be able to do that.

(I'm starting to think we need a new set of cairo-based widgets for GTK+
that support things like transparency &amp; transformations.)
