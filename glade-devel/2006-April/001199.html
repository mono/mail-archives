</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Thanks Damon, that does help. I may be pushing my luck here, but the
only problem remaining is that after placing the Image widget that is
used as background, one needs to place the other widgets outside the
Image area and then drag them into their final position over the
background Image area. It is not possible to place the other widgets
over the background Image area directly.
&gt;<i> Though I'd also take a patch that didn't raise the widgets
</I>&gt;<i> automatically, but had &quot;Raise&quot;/&quot;Lower&quot; context menu commands instead.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>This sounds like more versatile because in the use case of my
application the user would not necessarily need to place the background
Image as its first widget.

I can imagine other interesting combinations of images and control
widgets that could find this feature (placing widgets over an Image
widget) also useful. Think of an audio application that presents itself
as a car stereo image with control widgets over it. This is becoming a
common way of GUI in modern systems. Of course we also need things like
images with transparency for the control widgets like buttons, text
entry, etc. This last part may be more related to GTK than Glade. BTW
the label widget does have a transparent background and it can be used
as a button but without &quot;pressed&quot; feedback or we could use images for
the buttons that blend with the background, this is just more work but
it looks the same.
