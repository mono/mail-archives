I was reading this thread
<A HREF="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=gtkmm&amp;m=116376755831015&amp;w=2">http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=gtkmm&amp;m=116376755831015&amp;w=2</A>
and i think i am understanding whats the problem.
I think if you override GObject construct() method in the glibmm wrapper
and do all you have to do there (register the gtype and create the
wrapper if apropiate) it would solve most .

so.. if glibmm does this in his custom constructor() method you will not
have to do it in the post-create function and you will not have problems
with libglade either.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> so, loading a glade file results in all of the custom properties getting
</I>&gt;<i> set to their default values.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> a possible solution would be to introduce an additional callback
</I>&gt;<i> function in the style of &quot;post-create-function&quot;, that gets called after
</I>&gt;<i> the GObject is created and before it's properties are set (i suppose in
</I>&gt;<i> glade_widget_build_object() right after the call to g_object_newv()).
</I>
yep...

from gtk docs

&quot;constructor ()  the constructor function is called by g_object_new() to
complete the object initialization after all the construction properties
are set. The first thing a constructor implementation must do is chain
up to the constructor of the parent class. Overriding constructor should
be rarely needed, e.g. to handle construct properties, or to implement
singletons.&quot;

BTW it would be cool to add a way to specify the type name to be
registered so YourCustomWidget get registered as &quot;YourCustomWidget&quot; and
not something like &quot;glibmm__YourCustomWidget&quot;
