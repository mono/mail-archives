Please file bugs here:

&gt;&gt;<i> To answer that question above at a glance, assuming you have a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tictactoe_get_type()
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> function (and a Tictactoe object ofcourse) in libgladetictactoe (or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the library
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that libgladetictactoe links against) then glade will recognize it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and load all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> its properties automatically, if you need to change anything, than 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you start
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> playing with the &lt;properties&gt; tag etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I found out about the tictactoe_get_type()- error already. I had that 
</I>&gt;<i> function (as any gtk widget should have it, of course), but the 
</I>&gt;<i> library wasn't built properly (I made libglade-ttt.so from a 
</I>&gt;<i> stripped-down glade-gtk.c but didn't build the library depending on 
</I>&gt;<i> tictactoe.so). So I think to be able to add this kind of documentation 
</I>&gt;<i> in my document ... for later users.
</I>
Nod, I think its important to let the user decide if they will add the 
glade plugin
support code directly to thier library or to provide a &quot;plugin glue&quot; 
library for
glade purposes - to that end we may need some minor changes regarding
where the specified library is loaded from (we had discussed this 
earlier, but
iirc it wasnt important enough to anyone to bugzilla it.. so it probably got
forgotton).

&gt;&gt;<i> You should note too that *ahem* this api is going to change alot in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> near future and has already in cvs HEAD (currently unstable), but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'd love to help you anyway I can to document it !
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll be finding this out in the near future. But let me note that I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't think the API itself is not well enough documented : it's more 
</I>&gt;<i> the 'concepts' that are not too well described. Anyway, for the 
</I>&gt;<i> moment, I'm using gdb to see how the (glade) widget properties are 
</I>&gt;<i> loaded from my new (own) widget (see next paragraph).
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> We hang out quite alot at irc.gnome.org in #glade3, you're more than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> welcome to swing by and ask us whatever :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks ! Glad to hear this. You'll notice me around shortly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will put a first version of my document available shortly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Great thanks for you work &amp; interest !

Cheers,
                               -Tristan
