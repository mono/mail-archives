Well, my glade windows occupy a lot of screen estate. If nobody minds
I am going to add a menu invoked by right clicking on the dockable toolbar.
That menu will have a togglable show all/hide all option. That way it's much
simpler to just show/hide windows without having to quit glade, and I will
also add options to hide/show individual glade windows. Is this OK with
everyone. Right now right clicking on the dockable toolbar
does absolutely nothing so that should be OK right?

Thanks,

Neil
