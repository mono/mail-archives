I think that sounds reasonable.

Well,
    libglade only needs to be extended in the future with new widget
type definitions (as everything to do with properties is very generic, we 
can just feed more new properties and they will magicly end up on the
g_object_newv() arg list).

glade-3 OTOH, needs to know the intricate differences from one version
to the next, maybe some properties to some objects will be added, some
will be depricated, all that stuff probably needs to have some metadata
around it in the xml catalog (Since we could no longer simply rely on the
properties of the widgets that are instantiated at runtime, since thier versions
may not match to version of the requested glade file).

I'm not sure we're so very close to that feature :-/

Cheers,
                                                            -Tristan
