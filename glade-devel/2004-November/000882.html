ok good stuff.

</I>
GtkUIManager only covers menus and toolbars because it is a mechanism to
do take the pain out of UI merging by taking an &quot;action-based&quot; approach,
as far as I understand. For simple menus/toolbars it is probably normal
to build them the normal way but I think this supposed to be an easy way
to do something complex.

&gt;<i> For now, in glade-3 I think I'd rather steer clear of GtkUIManager, I'm sure
</I>&gt;<i> that toolbars and menus can easily be created via libglade without any 
</I>&gt;<i> roundabout extra xml parsing.
</I>
Ok. 

&gt;<i> I would rather ask, if a flavor of GtkUIManager could be written to support
</I>&gt;<i> glade files, or better yet; if the GladeXML object itself could simply be added
</I>&gt;<i> to gtk+ ?
</I>
heh I'm not sure how that would go its only fairly new anyway :)

Cheers, Shane
