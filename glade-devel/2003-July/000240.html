I know of no legitimate reason either.  &quot;Because it confuses people&quot; is an
extremely poor reason to do anything that hamstrings those of us who know
what we're doing.  The user_data parameter has a long and hallowed
history, dating all the way back to Motif.  Just because beginners don't
get it is no reason to delete it.  If that were true, rm -rf / would be a
legitimate response to any new Linux user's questions.  :P

I disagree.  I don't think it seems like a good reason at all.  See above,
for part of the reason why.  Beyond the &quot;don't cater to the ignorant&quot;
argument, the example quoted is horrific.  That sort of thinking is what
makes Java an acceptable solution to some people.  lookup_widget()?  In a
huge if else if else if search?  What are you nuts?  We started with O(1)
complexity and &quot;improved&quot; it to O(N) complexity or worse?  This is not
progress.  That whole block of code demonstrated should never exist.  The
GTK+ callback specification was written the way it was for a reason.  The
widget affected was _known_.  Throwing away valuable data like that is
frankly idiotic.  Those of us who understand that a single callback can be
registered for multiple widgets have no interest at all in an exhaustive
search for something we should be handed in the function call.

&gt;<i> If they stick to the idea of chopping every good features (like this
</I>&gt;<i> one) in the next versions of Glade, then, &quot;just too bad&quot;, I'll be happy
</I>&gt;<i> to use my &quot;home-made-patch&quot;-ed version of Glade-2.0 for all my personal
</I>&gt;<i> development needs.  That's the beauty of Open Source, at the very
</I>&gt;<i> least... :)
</I>
I for one will be using the patched version.  I make extensive use of ALL
the original callback parameters and I refuse to shoot myself in the foot
for somebody else's misguided idea of simplicity.  All hail Open Source.
