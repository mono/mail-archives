You're sooo right.  Especially for that Java-culture thing too.  

I just want want to ammend what I said concerning the &quot;Object&quot; feature.  I find it a little complicated just because it allows signal receivers to be modified (or something like that) and getse confusing.   But it's just my opinion, because I don't fully understand it doesn't mean it should not be there... eheh :-).  I guess I should have said it in another way.  Sorry for that :-).  But about the &quot;user_data&quot; feature, I can't honestly see why they would like to remove it (??).  

Unclear.
 
Re: &gt; If they stick to the idea of chopping every good features (like this
Re: &gt; one) in the next versions of Glade, then, &quot;just too bad&quot;, I'll be happy
Re: &gt; to use my &quot;home-made-patch&quot;-ed version of Glade-2.0 for all my personal
Re: &gt; development needs.  That's the beauty of Open Source, at the very
Re: &gt; least... :)
Re:

Re: for somebody else's misguided idea of simplicity.  All hail Open Source.
Re: 
Re: DM


Great, thanks for you &quot;moral support&quot; too! :)  Ehehe.

Good'day to all,
