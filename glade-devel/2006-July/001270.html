The problem is that different widgets have different default settings
for can_focus, so it isn't trivial to fix. We could just always write
out the can_focus setting, but it isn't needed 99.9% of the time so is a
bit wasteful.


&gt;<i> Or should it be fixed somewhere else, by makeing &quot;can_focus=False&quot; the

</I>&gt;<i> I've got a couple of buttons in a VBox that must not get the focus, and

</I>
I'd suggest you set can_focus to FALSE in your code instead. That is
easy to do.
