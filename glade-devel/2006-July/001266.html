<PRE>I'm using glade 2.12.1-5 from Debian etch and fell over this bug[1]

[1]
<A HREF="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=322340">http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=322340</A>

As a workaround I first had to enabled it in glade,
and later change it by hand to get:

&lt;property name=&quot;can_focus&quot;&gt;False&lt;/property&gt;

Are there any, probably non-obvious, reasons that prevent this bug from
being fixed?

Or should it be fixed somewhere else, by makeing &quot;can_focus=False&quot; the
default behavior when the line missing or something?

I've got a couple of buttons in a VBox that must not get the focus, and
it's pretty anoying having to fix this by hand after each Open/Save cycle.
