I'm sorry, but I seem to have missed this bit; why shouldn't people use
glade?

Is there an archive for #gtk+?  I'd like to read this.

Yeah.  Note that for some languages (such as my favorite, Haskell),
using libglade is painful enough to suggest a need for another code
generator to handle all the cruft :)

&gt;<i> but I think the same basic principle applies there. If you don't have

</I>&gt;<i>  even then.)
</I>
Somebody better tell the bison &amp; flex folks; I think they've missed
this somehow :)
