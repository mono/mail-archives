I can't really remove it from glade-2 at this point. But I could add
stuff to the docs to explain the pros &amp; cons of each.

Code generation does have some good points at present though. It is good
for playing around with tiny apps, as you can build and run them almost
immediately. I just never got around to making it scalable.

glade-3 won't have a code generator built-in, but unfortunately I
don't think anyone is working on that at present.
