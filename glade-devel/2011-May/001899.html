<PRE>Dear glade-devel list readers,

For those of you who didn't know yet, I was accepted to work on Glade 
for Google Summer of Code! (Thanks for Juan Pablo Ugarte for mentoring 
me. :)) My project is to add support for creating and editing GObject 
property bindings (a.k.a. GBinding); see [1] for my complete proposal.

The official coding period starts on May 23. Until then, I'll dedicate 
my time to digging into Glade's source code and discussing the details 
of the project's design and implementation with you and my mentor. So if 
you have any comments or suggestions, I would love to hear them!

I am really excited about being able to work on Glade during the summer. 
I hope it works out well. :)

Best regards,
Denis Washington
