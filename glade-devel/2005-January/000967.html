Hmmm, 
    The problem is that the UI gets alot less obvious in the case of
non-widgets anyway, what happens when you want to add a
GtkEntryCompletion to a GtkEntry (this is probably a bad example),
or a GtkSizeGroup to a GtkBox (or are size-groups always toplevels ?).

On the one hand, I really want to make the glade-3 code as generic
as possible with the highest possible level of code reuse (when dealing
with irratic toolkits that are always changing, we want glade-3 to &quot;just work&quot;
as much as possible).

On the other hand, the GtkOptionMenu in glade-2 (that I just looked at) is
really sexy I have to admit :)

I think we have to ask ourselves if it is worth special-casing every wierd 
doodad like toolbars and menus with entire editor codebases ?

Cheers,
                                               -Tristan

&lt;brainstorm&gt;
    Hmmm, the glade-2 menu editor is basicly a property editor for each MenuItem
with a treeview that allows you to select the menu items, an
equivalent can be reached
by navigating the project-view and editing the menu/tool items
directly in the editor.

What if optionaly the property-editor could display a treeview of its non-widget
children (or more specificly its non &quot;GtkContainer-&gt;GtkWidget&quot;
relation children)
and allow Add/Remove capabilities from there ?
&lt;/brainstorm&gt;
