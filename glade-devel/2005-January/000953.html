<PRE>Tor,

Thank you for the descriptions on current GTK+2.6.1, and I am excited to
hear that the GTK+2.6.1 win32 port will be release some time in the
future. Do you have in your mind something about when win32 port will
roughly be available. I am considering if I want to wait for the release
or to try to build the win32 port by myself.

Regards,
Fanz=20

 &gt; Does anybody know when the Win32 port will be posted on web,

There are still a couple of relatively important (IMHO) open Win32
issues in the GTK+ 2.6.1 sources. As soon as they have been resolved
(fixes committed), I will build and release Win32 binaries (i.e. a
2.6.1-timestamp snapshot unless 2.6.2 happens to be relased suitably).

A warning to people thinking of building software for Windows against
GTK+ 2.6.1: Plase read and ponder what it says in the README file:

  * GLib 2.6 introduces the concept of 'GLib filename encoding', which
is the
    on-disk encoding on Unix, but UTF-8 on Windows. All GLib functions
    returning or accepting pathnames have been changed to expect
    filenames in this encoding, and the common POSIX functions dealing
    with pathnames have been wrapped. These wrappers are declared in the
    header &lt;glib/gstdio.h&gt; which must be included explicitly; it is not
    included through &lt;glib.h&gt;.

    On current (NT-based) Windows versions, where the on-disk file names
    are Unicode, these wrappers use the wide-character API in the C
    library. Thus applications can handle file names containing any
    Unicode characters through GLib's own API and its POSIX wrappers,
    not just file names restricted to characters in the system codepage.

    To keep binary compatibility with applications compiled against
    older versions of GLib, the Windows DLL still provides entry points
    with the old semantics using the old names, and applications
    compiled against GLib 2.6 will actually use new names for the
    functions. This is transparent to the programmer.

    When compiling against GLib 2.6, applications intended to be
    portable to Windows must take the UTF-8 file name encoding into
    consideration, and use the gstdio wrappers to access files whose
    names have been constructed from strings returned from GLib.

  * Likewise, g_get_user_name() and g_get_real_name() have been changed=20
    to return UTF-8 on Windows, while keeping the old semantics for=20
    applications compiled against older versions of GLib.

I.e., if you construct file names from strings returned from GLib
(g_get_user_name, g_dir_read_name, g_get_current_dir, etc), you *must*
use the so-called gstdio wrappers (g_open, g_fopen, etc) with these
file names. (No ifdefs needed, it doesn't to use the wrappers on Unix,
too, although they don't do anything.)
