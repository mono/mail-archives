<PRE>Hi,

I've been looking at getting toolbar editing working (bug #157163). 
There are basically two options:

1. Make it work like in glade-2, where the toolbar is just a regular 
container, and you have additional tool items in the palette for toolbar 
buttons, check/togglebuttons and a toolbar separator item. You can also 
put any other widget in the toolbar, in which case glade automatically 
inserts a tool item container for you.

2. Implement a toolbar editor instead and don't expose the toolbar as a 
container.

If anyone has any thoughts about this, I'd be interested in hearing 
about them.

The first solution is pretty good in my opinion. Having a toolbar editor 
that would work nicely with drag and drop etc would be nice, but it 
would be a lot more work. Maybe it is something that we can implement 
later on.

Bringing the current glade-2 like toolbar editing to a working state 
should be pretty quick, I've done most of it already. Adding a container 
widget automatically like glade-2 does is more tricky, I don't think 
it's possible currently so we would have to add some infrastructure for 
that. Do we want this?

Comments, anyone?

Regards,
Richard
