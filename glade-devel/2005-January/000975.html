Hi,
    As you probably know; glade-3 is having some issues that have
to be dealt with before anything can really be distributed, namely
glade file saving mechanism.

As you've noticed, the bulk of glade-3 development has been
emerging on the LIBGLADE_INTEGRATION branch and it makes
no sence for me to apply major patches to HEAD ATM.

As people in general are feeling hesitant to include file saveing in
libglade I fear that we will have to write our equivalent in the glade-3
codebase (it turns out that it was a little more complicated than we
thought, although that should be expected because its always the case ;-)

In light of the situation; I think the appropriate course of action is to
apply the anjuta changes to LIBGLADE_INTEGRATION (as you pointed
out on irc, it doesn't change much for your patch) and then turn our
focus to the libglade modifications that we are depending on.

Right now that means:
    - Reconsidering the parser sharing aproach
    - Getting at least the other changes in (i18n'ness &amp; non-widget objects)

For that it would really be best if we could all have a meeting and sort this 
out with James.

Unfortunatly, that might not be fast enough for your beta release...
I dont really know what to say about that (and I wouldn't really call
glade-3 beta material yet either, the core codebase is rock-solid IMO,
only there are alot of annoying loose ends, like composite widget dialogs
that are a true pain to deal with).

Cheers,
                                                                      
  -Tristan
