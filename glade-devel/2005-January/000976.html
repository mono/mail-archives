</I>Okay.

I had no idea about LIBGLADE_INTEGRATION brach before so the patch was
created from HEAD.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Okay, I guess that means I should commit the patch in the branch.

&gt;<i> Unfortunatly, that might not be fast enough for your beta release...

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>That's fine. Anjuta beta release is just The Plan (tm). I am not even
sure anjuta can make it either, but the point is to keep sticking on to
it :-). Glade doesn't have to be released along with it, as the plugin
will be conditionally compiled for now. I just wanted to have the option
to demonstrate it to people interested in it.

Thanks.
