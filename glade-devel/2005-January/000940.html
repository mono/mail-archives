<PRE>Hi,

I'm working on improving the support for external libraries in Glade3. 
Currently you have a file called glade-palette.xml which contains the 
catalogs to load. This isn't very feasible when you want to add your own 
catalog file. The palette file also has another function, it describes 
the order in which the catalogs should be displayed in the UI.

For telling which catalogs exist I think it would be better try to load 
all xml-files available in $prefix/share/glade-$VERSION/catalogs. This 
way you will only have to install catalog file in that directory in 
order to have it available for Glade3. When it comes to the order it 
might just be OK to hard code it as:

Gtk+ Base
Gtk+ Additional
Gtk+ Standard Dialogs
&lt;All other files read&gt;
Gtk+ Obsolete

or something. This would make the glade-palette file obsolete.

Another thing that cought my eye is that we should probably not name the 
data directory glade-$VERSION as third party libraries won't be visible 
after an update from glade-3.0.1 to glade-3.0.2. Probably better to just 
call the directory 'glade-3'.

Any thoughts on this, as soon as we can reach a concensus on this I'll 
implement it.

Best Regards,
   Mikael Hallendal
