&gt;<i> Hi all,

For those who are interested, this is the meeting post where use
of libglade as a loader/saver was originaly brought up:
    <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/glade-devel/2004-October/000844.html">http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/glade-devel/2004-October/000844.html</A>

I just re-read it to refresh my memory.

&gt;<i> Basically as I see it, there is one pro with using libglade to load the
</I>&gt;<i> files: The parser doesn't need to be duplicated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some cons:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Libglade is really meant to be used for &quot;runtime&quot; operation, as used
</I>&gt;<i> normally by applications. In order to be used to load glade files in
</I>&gt;<i> glade, it needs to either be hacked to have two &quot;modes&quot;, one normal mode
</I>&gt;<i> and one for glade where it keeps more data around, or it will need to
</I>&gt;<i> keep unneccesary data.
</I>
I wouldn't call it a hack at all, 
    the libglade api uses glade_xml_build_widget () to actualy construct 
the widget and add it to a hash table for lookups (and some other misc stuff), 
But the glade file is already parsed at that point and loaded into a
GladeInterface structure, we use the GladeInterface struct to build our widgets,
not a dual mode to glade_xml_new().

Note also that libglade dosn't need all that much extra code to be able 
to load files, the GladeInterface struct might grow a few bytes in
user applications
but if those applications are written properly, they'll g_object_unref (xml)
once they finished doing any glade_xml_get_widget() (since the GladeXML is
heavy and useless to have around after application startup anyway).

&gt;<i> An example of this is the i18n metadata (translatable, context, i18n
</I>&gt;<i> comment) that is edited by the user in glade, but only used during
</I>&gt;<i> parsing in normal use, or not used at all (the comment).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Besides just storing the metadata, there are additional problems
</I>&gt;<i> handling it. For instance, the i18n context: libglade optionally strips
</I>&gt;<i> a context prefix from strings before translating them and this prefix
</I>&gt;<i> needs to be kept when used in glade, since it's part of the original
</I>&gt;<i> string that the user inputs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Translations also need to be special cased in some way. Right now, all
</I>&gt;<i> strings that happen to be translated in glade itself, also are
</I>&gt;<i> translated in the loaded files.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Every time we need to add some kind of metadata, libglade would need to
</I>&gt;<i> be involved. There would be an added constraint on what we can do with
</I>&gt;<i> the glade UI, and also be more work to fit it into libglade's parser.
</I>
In 99% of these cases, namespaced custom properties can be used (which
are transperent to libglade), and in any other cases (such as:
    `&lt;property name=&quot;bla&quot; translatable=true&gt;text&lt;/property&gt;'
which forces us to add `-&gt;translatable' to the GladePropInfo struct) this
does two good things for us:

    1.) It forces us to reconsider this design (I'm still wondering why
          &quot;translatable&quot; isn't just a custom property on GtkLabel or any
          other translatable widgets, I have to admit I havent understood
          why &quot;properties&quot; are translatable directly.

    2.) It forces us to update GladeInterface structures in the 1% of the time
          when its really nescisary, this IMO is a good thing because it should
          reduce overall confusion (It should be a plus that the GladeInterface
          structures are a direct and complete replication of all
glade metadata)
          Since it would have to be updated somewhere in glade-3 anyway, why
          not do it in one centralized place ?

&gt;<i> Finally, there are plans for GTK+ to get an equivalence of libglade
</I>&gt;<i> soon, in 2.8 if possible. Once that happens, there will be no
</I>&gt;<i> possibility for glade special casing, additions or hacks inside GTK+ for
</I>&gt;<i> glade specific stuff. If we have our own parser, we can handle
</I>&gt;<i> everything inside glade.
</I>
I dont see why this should be a problem, we can still use an exposed
low level parser in gtk+ to get GladeInterface built from xml files, we also 
get the added gain of alot more people arguing for or against integration
of features (which are most likely hacks) such as &quot;translatable&quot; on properties
(and in normal cases, we just use custom properties).

There is this one major added gain in loading/saving glade files in our
own duplicated codebase: It allows us to dictate the functionality of glade 
without being forced to cooperate directly with other projects, I am not 
convinced that this is a valid plus.

Cheers,
                                                            -Tristan
