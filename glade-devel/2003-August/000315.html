&gt;<i> Hi

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Archit,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Probably one of the simplest interfaces would be to remove the Add /
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Delete buttons.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Just using the &quot;Insert&quot; and the &quot;Delete&quot; keys on the keyboard can be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; used to add a new entry on the GtkTreeView.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cancel, apply, and ok buttons can also disappear, just leaving a &quot;Close&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; button and making changes instantanely applicable (we have undo, so we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; don't need &quot;Cancel&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well although it is a good idea to link to those key-bindings, removing
</I>&gt;<i> the Insert and Delete buttons altogether isn't such a good idea IMHO.
</I>
Well, current IU motto is more or less to remove cruft.  If the same operation 
can be done more easily with the keystrokes, then why leave the buttons?

It should be a good idea to put a label somewhere explaining that you should 
use the &quot;Insert&quot; and &quot;Delete&quot; buttons, however, to make it obvious.

Anyway you will collect better flam^H^H^H^H feedback @usability :)

&gt;<i> &gt; We still have the arrow keys to move the entries all around.  These are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; also probably superfluous, but I don't see how to remove them so easily.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Probably you can change up and down an entry just with drag &amp; drop.  You
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will surely find somebody @usability that will easily find something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; better than the left and right buttons.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While we're at it, we could add key bindings for the up/down left/right to
</I>&gt;<i> the regular keyboard keys.
</I>
I first though about it, but then you screw the navigation on the tree using 
the keyboard.  Ctrl+arrow may work better (again, a little label saying it 
would not hurt).

&gt;<i> &gt; P.S.: I will probably do a little modification to the catalogs after
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all, as I've converted glade-gtk into a dynamic library (only on Linux
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; right now), and just realized that we have no way to specify the name of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the library on the catalog...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You could just hard code it. Just a thought
</I>
Nope, it will work for libgladegtk, but not for foreign libraries.  I can't 
know in advance the libraries people are going to use.

Cheers,

</PRE>
