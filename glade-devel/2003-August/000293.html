Scaffold will eventualy get Glade 3 support in it umong other things. 
I've been looking at Glade 3 though I am not doing the development part
for Scaffold as I have other things to get to but rest assured it will
eventualy be integrated which will most likely involve writting Bonobo
wrappers since Scaffold's plugin system is for the most part Bonobo
based.
