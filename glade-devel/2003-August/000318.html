Hi Archit!

Currently galde-3 doesn't use libglade, but I think that it's mostly
because our gui is simple and nobody felt the need. I see no problem
with depending on libglade, after all that's what our users sholuld be
using in their programs :)

On the other hand if you already have it done without libglade you may
choose to go on that way for now and eventually switch to libglade later
(maybe we can see if there are other parts for which switching to
libglade is convenient)

Last word to Joaquin, as  usual :)

ciao
