&gt;<i> Hi Archit,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Probably one of the simplest interfaces would be to remove the Add /
</I>&gt;<i> Delete buttons.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just using the &quot;Insert&quot; and the &quot;Delete&quot; keys on the keyboard can be
</I>&gt;<i> used to add a new entry on the GtkTreeView.
</I>&gt;<i> Cancel, apply, and ok buttons can also disappear, just leaving a &quot;Close&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> button and making changes instantanely applicable (we have undo, so we
</I>&gt;<i> don't need &quot;Cancel&quot;)
</I>
Well although it is a good idea to link to those key-bindings, removing
the Insert and Delete buttons altogether isn't such a good idea IMHO.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We still have the arrow keys to move the entries all around.  These are
</I>&gt;<i> also probably superfluous, but I don't see how to remove them so easily.
</I>&gt;<i> Probably you can change up and down an entry just with drag &amp; drop.  You
</I>&gt;<i> will surely find somebody @usability that will easily find something
</I>&gt;<i> better than the left and right buttons.
</I>
While we're at it, we could add key bindings for the up/down left/right to
the regular keyboard keys.

DND isn't a bad idea either :-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As the current is not far from working (at least it worked for flat
</I>&gt;<i> menus, if I remember right), I suggest to first finish the current menu,
</I>&gt;<i> and then do any wild changes you like :-)
</I>
Precisely.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Probably the best list for this discussion is neither glade-users nor
</I>&gt;<i> desktop-devel but <A HREF="mailto:usability@gnome.org.">usability@gnome.org.</A>  Please, if you want to discuss
</I>&gt;<i> it there, start a new thread there instead of cross posting it, this way
</I>&gt;<i> we will not have half the discussion here and half the discussion there.
</I>
Well I did to the first 2. I might as well start it on usability.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> P.S.: I will probably do a little modification to the catalogs after
</I>&gt;<i> all, as I've converted glade-gtk into a dynamic library (only on Linux
</I>&gt;<i> right now), and just realized that we have no way to specify the name of
</I>&gt;<i> the library on the catalog...
</I>
You could just hard code it. Just a thought

Archit
