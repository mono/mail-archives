<PRE>Hi

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you two are done fixing you last major patches, I could consider glade-3
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reasonably stable to branch (again, if indeed its needed).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not very familiar with branches, but I think that if you decide to
</I>&gt;<i> branch to work on the menu editor you can do it whenever you want: since
</I>&gt;<i> it's a self contained piece of code, it should not be affected by other
</I>&gt;<i> changes.
</I>
Yes but I would like to branch at a stage when the rest of the code is stable.
Like I said, I don't want to bump into bugs (atleast not eh trivial ones), on
my way to fixing the Menu Editor.

 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While I'm at it let me write some random thoughts/questions/ideas about
</I>&gt;<i> the menu editor:
</I>
I was going to send a similar followup email too :D

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * It seems to me that in gtk-2.4 the menu widget has been completely
</I>&gt;<i> overhowled, with the integration of the menu stuff that was in egg. Does
</I>&gt;<i> this affect the menu editor? (I think that when gtk2.4 comes out we
</I>&gt;<i> should start supporting its new widgets, and probably at some point
</I>&gt;<i> switch completely to 2.4 as a requirement)
</I>
IIRC its the toolbar not the menubar. Again I have to confirm this.

&gt;<i> * A boring, but badly needed change is switching the current menu editor
</I>&gt;<i> from gtkclist to gtktreeview: AFAIK is the only thing (modulo minor
</I>&gt;<i> stuff) preventing us to compile with -DGTK_DISABLE_DPERECATED
</I>
Ofcourse. The current code in the glade-menu-editor.[ch] code is copied
verbatim from glade-2. Besides that we'll also need to put in some catalog
xml files for GtkMenubar, GtkMenuItem, GtkMenu.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * A review/simplification of the ui of the menu editor is probably
</I>&gt;<i> needed: maybe we should try to get some inputs (even better mockups)
</I>&gt;<i> from users and ui experts.
</I>
Indeed, if there was some previous discussion on major changes regarding this
for glade-2 we should keep them in mind too.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Sometimes ago there was some discussion about changing the way
</I>&gt;<i> accelerators for the menu entries work; in particular may be worth
</I>&gt;<i> trying to get rid of the key selection dialog and investigate if the
</I>&gt;<i> accelerator stuff in libegg fits our needs (you can see it working in
</I>&gt;<i> GnomeTerminal keyboard shortcuts editor)
</I>
Yup

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * We must remember that the menu editor is also used for the optionmenu
</I>&gt;<i> widget and not only for the menubar. This is probably related to find a
</I>&gt;<i> way to specify the &quot;Edit menu&quot; button in the xml file of the widget
</I>&gt;<i> class instead of the hack we have now. (Note that this is not strictly
</I>&gt;<i> related to the menu editor code itself and may interact/conflict with
</I>&gt;<i> Joaquin changes to the catalogs)
</I>
I think a simple &quot;can_have_menus&quot; or something simlar xml property would
be all that would be required (and subsquent changes to glade_widget_class_new_from_node).
