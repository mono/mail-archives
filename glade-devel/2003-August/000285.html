<PRE>Hi

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 	this afternoon I committed a couple of patches which add icons to the
</I>&gt;<i> entries in the project view (used in the main window and in the widget
</I>&gt;<i> tree) and in the clipboard view.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Beside in the clipboard view I switched from a GtkTreeStore to a
</I>&gt;<i> GtkListStore: as a matter of fact in the clipboard view we (and glade2
</I>&gt;<i> does the same) just list the widgets on the clipboard without having a
</I>&gt;<i> tree of their childrens. Note that the populate_model[_real] had some
</I>&gt;<i> code for adding children, but that was never triggered because was
</I>&gt;<i> inside an always false condition.
</I>
Well we had kept it so that if need be in the future they ask us to show
children in the clipboard-view, we can just set &quot;add_children&quot; paramter to
true. But since we don't need it, its nice to get rid of that code.

&gt;<i> A nice side effect of this last change is that the -&gt;children field of
</I>&gt;<i> GladeWidget is not used anywhere anymore (exception made for a couple of
</I>&gt;<i> places where -&gt;children is assigned and that can obvoiusly go away): so
</I>&gt;<i> my next step is to get rid of -&gt;children in GladeWidget.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Even if the code impact of this change is small I would like to have
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;green light&quot; signal before going on, since it is a design issue: as a
</I>&gt;<i> matter of fact I think that originally the tree structure in GladeWidget
</I>&gt;<i> (formed by -&gt;parent and -&gt;children) was considered as the main structure
</I>&gt;<i> to map the hierachy of the created GUI and of the xml file.
</I>&gt;<i> However this information is redundant since Gtk already has a tree
</I>&gt;<i> structure (each gtkWidget has parent and, if it is a container,
</I>&gt;<i> children) and in fact we already use that internal tree to write the
</I>&gt;<i> .glade file.
</I>
Hmm didn't know that.

&gt;<i> IMHO keeping this additional tree structure is just a pain since it must
</I>&gt;<i> be kept in sync with the gtk intenal one (see reparenting in
</I>&gt;<i> glade_project_add/remove).
</I>
I agree. No point in keeping that extra structure (if it doesn't keep any
additional info besides what Gtk+ does for us).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Once GladeWidget-&gt;children is gone, GladeWidget-&gt;parent should be easy
</I>&gt;<i> to kill: introducing a glade_widget_get_parent function which works as
</I>&gt;<i> glade_placeholder_get_parent should do.
</I>
/me holds up green flag.
