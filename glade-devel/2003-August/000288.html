(the part you quoted was about the clipboard, but I assume you are
talking about the widget tree and the main window)

I think that we should try to stay with the same gui of glade-2 as long
as glade-3 is not ready. Once it can be used for real work we can review
all the gui with the ui/usability expert. IMHO making arbitrary changes
now wolud make the glade2-&gt;glade3 transition more difficult.

Anyway I don't have a strong opinion about getting rid of the widget
tree in a separate window and put it in the main window instead of the
simple list of toplevels, but you must consider the following:
- if the project is big an expanded widget tree can be quite big and
have many levels of indentation, while the main window has a fixed small
size.
- In my personal experience you don't use the widget tree that much,
while you often need to click on the toplevels to switch from a window
to another; as a matter of fact the widget tree is hidden on startup.

The important thing is that in glade3 the ProjectView is a widget which
implements the widget tree/list and make this kind of change is really
easy: in particular if Anjuta or Scaffold use glade3 thay can choose to
use this widget in the way that fit them better, e.g putting the widget
tree in a page of a notebook etc.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I'm not sayng that it's wrong, but the trade off is getting rid of a
window (which is not used a lot) and clutter the main window with more
stuff.

&gt;<i> We also need to have &quot;Collapse all&quot; button near the tree widget.
</I>
This would definetely be good. I would say to put both a Collapse and an
Expand button in the widget tree window. Patches welcome ;)
(maybe you could also try to get such a change into glade2)
