As a developer of Scaffold I would like to point out that we use Bonobo
quite successfully without any noticable slowdowns.  To throw my hat in
the ring it would be nice if the developers did both 1 and 2.  If the
libraries stuck to the GObject and GtkObject specifications writting
wrappers should not be that hard.  Scaffold already does this with
Glimmer which is a Bonobo wrapper to GtkSourceView.
