<PRE>Hi Archit,

Probably one of the simplest interfaces would be to remove the Add /
Delete buttons.

Just using the &quot;Insert&quot; and the &quot;Delete&quot; keys on the keyboard can be
used to add a new entry on the GtkTreeView.
Cancel, apply, and ok buttons can also disappear, just leaving a &quot;Close&quot;
button and making changes instantanely applicable (we have undo, so we
don't need &quot;Cancel&quot;)

We still have the arrow keys to move the entries all around.  These are
also probably superfluous, but I don't see how to remove them so easily.
Probably you can change up and down an entry just with drag &amp; drop.  You
will surely find somebody @usability that will easily find something
better than the left and right buttons.

As the current is not far from working (at least it worked for flat
menus, if I remember right), I suggest to first finish the current menu,
and then do any wild changes you like :-)

Probably the best list for this discussion is neither glade-users nor
desktop-devel but <A HREF="mailto:usability@gnome.org.">usability@gnome.org.</A>  Please, if you want to discuss
it there, start a new thread there instead of cross posting it, this way
we will not have half the discussion here and half the discussion there.

Cheers,

P.S.: I will probably do a little modification to the catalogs after
all, as I've converted glade-gtk into a dynamic library (only on Linux
right now), and just realized that we have no way to specify the name of
the library on the catalog...
