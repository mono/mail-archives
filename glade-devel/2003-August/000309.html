Hi!

&gt;<i> I have 2 main questions while I'm sort of reimplementing the menu editor for
</I>&gt;<i> glade3.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Reworking accellerators. Like Joaquin mentioned in another thread, instead
</I>&gt;<i> of selecting accellerators from a menu, it would be better if the user clicks
</I>&gt;<i> a button, then presses his keys-combination which is captured by the menu
</I>&gt;<i> editor and saved. I think this is much more usable and friendly for users for
</I>&gt;<i> Glade3
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I've already mentioned this in another thread, but for the record I'll
repeat it here :)
For the accelerator it may be worth using eggaccelerator.[ch]; it is
used in gnome-terminal for those who want to take a look at it.

Btw, maybe we should cc some other lists beside glade-devel to get some
ui feedback... I don't think that most of the glade-users are subscribed
here. Maybe glade-users or desktop-devel (the first is glade specific
while the second is where most of the gnome ui review take place...)

ciao
