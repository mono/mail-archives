</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; If you two are done fixing you last major patches, I could consider
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; glade-3
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; reasonably stable to branch (again, if indeed its needed).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I'm not very familiar with branches, but I think that if you decide to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; branch to work on the menu editor you can do it whenever you want: since
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; it's a self contained piece of code, it should not be affected by other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; changes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes but I would like to branch at a stage when the rest of the code is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stable.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Like I said, I don't want to bump into bugs (atleast not eh trivial ones),
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; my way to fixing the Menu Editor.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that you can keep working on HEAD.  The code seems stable to me, even 
</I>&gt;<i> if there is still a bit of clean up to do on glade-widget-class.c (obviously 
</I>&gt;<i> the _new_from_name2 was a temporary name...), it should not affect the 
</I>&gt;<i> stability of the code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't have the intention to change the catalog format, so I will not 
</I>&gt;<i> introduce any incompatibilities that may hurt your work in this point.
</I>
Ok. Already started.
 
&gt;<i> All in all, I don't think that it's worth the pain to have a separate branch.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; While I'm at it let me write some random thoughts/questions/ideas about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the menu editor:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I was going to send a similar followup email too :D
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; * It seems to me that in gtk-2.4 the menu widget has been completely
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; overhowled, with the integration of the menu stuff that was in egg. Does
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; this affect the menu editor? (I think that when gtk2.4 comes out we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; should start supporting its new widgets, and probably at some point
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; switch completely to 2.4 as a requirement)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IIRC its the toolbar not the menubar. Again I have to confirm this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is also a menubar (some points of its implementation are still being 
</I>&gt;<i> discussed on gtk-devel right now).  I don't think that it affects too much the 
</I>&gt;<i> menu editor, but it will certainly affect how we construct the real menu once 
</I>&gt;<i> the user has specified the entries.
</I>
Well its mainly &quot;menu-merging&quot; (like they have in Bonobo) that is new.
Besides I talked to jamesh on #gnome and he told me form libglade's point of
view the .glade file format for a menubar remains the same.

However one thing that might be interesting is the introduction of 
&quot;GtkActions&quot; (thats the name IIRC), common code for simlar menu items and
toolbar items. We may need to change GladeMenuEditor to something more like
GladeMenuAndActionEditor.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; * Sometimes ago there was some discussion about changing the way
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; accelerators for the menu entries work; in particular may be worth
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; trying to get rid of the key selection dialog and investigate if the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; accelerator stuff in libegg fits our needs (you can see it working in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; GnomeTerminal keyboard shortcuts editor)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yup
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As somebody said, the current IU is like looking back to gnome 1.x, so there 
</I>&gt;<i> is definitively room for improvement.  One thing that may be done better is 
</I>&gt;<i> just grabbing the accelerator instead of selecting it from a list.
</I>
I will talk about this in a new thread so glade-1 and glade-2 ppl can
contribute too.

Cheers!
Archit
