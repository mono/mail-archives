In fact, since I &quot;upgraded&quot; my video card a few months
ago, I've not been able to get an usable output from
XFree86, so I've been working on glade-3 exclusively
on Windows these lasts months.

&gt;<i> anyways, it seems like a much better design to

</I>
I've only put the only thing that was common to each
and every xml file, visibility.  In fact, even
visibility was not everywhere, and when it was
present, sometimes it was a Common property, and
sometimes it was a normal property, so putting it on
gtkwidget.xml unifies its use.

I was also kind of expecting to put a tooltip
property, but other than that I guess that it will be
like it's right now.

Cheers,
