I don't think that Archit was thinking on slowdowns
when he said &quot;Lots of Bonobo/CORBA overhead involved&quot;.
 It looks to me as if he was speaking of intelectual
overhead (but that's up to him to clarify it).

FWIW, I don't really care if somebody does a bonobo
wraper of glade.  Just having a bonobo wrapper doesn't
mean that we can't build glade on windows.  The bonobo
wrapper would of course only be available on the linux
build, but that's not a problem.

Anyway, I think that you should start trying to use
glade-3 on scaffold (even if just copying &amp; pasting
the code) and bring the most important issues on
current glade-3 to make it usable (I'm expecting
changes to report the addition of new callbacks to
scaffold, at the very least).

It's already discutable the usefulness of having the
editor as a component, let alone an alpha quality user
interface builder.

So, in short, a bonobo wrapper will be nice, but if
you want it right now, you will have to do it yourself
:<i>)
