Both.
As a matter of fact the gtk menu stuff was committed yesterday :)

By the way, IIRC the menubar/toolbar stuff in libegg that now is in gtk
were related: you have a set of actions (eg cut, copy etc) and then both
a menu entry and a button in the toolbar can represent the action.
How does this affect our menu editor?
