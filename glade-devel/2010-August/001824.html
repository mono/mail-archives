</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; that the model's stamp should not change... I'm not sure).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO the gtk+ documentation says that an iter is only valid as long as the

</I>
Ok that makes perfect sense to me. Sorry I missed the stamp fix
for GladeProject, I'm going to go over your patch and make sure
I didnt miss anything (for instance I at least missed the incrementing
of the stamp when the project tree changes...).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; - The iter-&gt;stamp should be initialized to something random,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> otherwise every model
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; starts with stamp == 0 (possibly making the iter from the last
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> destroyed signal model
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; appear &quot;valid&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wasn't assuming that someone would use an iter on a wrong model but if
</I>&gt;<i> we want to catch that case we might want to start which a random number. I

</I>
I guess it is at least important that the initial stamp is not 0, since
0 is what we generally use to represent an invalid iter (when
the iter to return was not found for instance).

Actually I was just guessing at why treestore initializes its stamp
to a non-zero random number... I can vouch that treestore (or liststore that
I checked... not sure) does this but I'm not exactly sure why.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; - I would prefer we stick with firing Glade's generic object
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> selection dialog to select
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; the project object for a signal user data - I dont like the idea
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of navigating recursive menus
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; or dropping down a combo box with a possible &gt; 1000 objects to select.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, I will change that. I just was easy to implement for now but the UI
</I>&gt;<i> is satisfying at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just some additional note: The dnd code currently uses the old gdk_drawing
</I>&gt;<i> funtions that have been removed from gtk+. I didn't have the time to
</I>&gt;<i> change that as I didn't fully understood how to do that in cairo. But it
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't be a big deal.
</I>
Extra note... I went ahead and copied out some GTK+ internals:
   glade_utils_cairo_draw_rectangle(), glade_utils_cairo_draw_line()

... in the case they may be helpful to you... also feel free to add some
convenience drawing functions to glade-utils.[ch] if you think that makes
sense for what needs drawing.

Cheers,
      -Tristan
