<PRE>Hi Tristan!

&gt;<i>   - Firstly I can see you went and implemented the GtkTreeIter-&gt;stamp a
</I>&gt;<i> bit more
</I>&gt;<i>     robustly than in GladeProject, additionally the code needs to assert
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i>     any input iter: (iter-&gt;stamp == model-&gt;priv-&gt;stamp). I've already
</I>&gt;<i> done this for
</I>&gt;<i>     GladeProject and will commit that soon (it helped alot to debug...
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunately
</I>&gt;<i>     I could still not completely solve bug 627078 and have not
</I>&gt;<i> committed that yet,
</I>&gt;<i>     I'll commit the checking code now regardless).
</I>
I filed bug <A HREF="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=623879">https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=623879</A> for that
some time ago to also fix it in GladeProject. But you might be right that
we might want to check it with an assertion.

&gt;<i>   - Can you explain why the model-&gt;priv-&gt;stamp must be incremented
</I>&gt;<i> when the overall
</I>&gt;<i>     model data changes ? (it could be that GladeProject needs this
</I>&gt;<i> treatment too... or
</I>&gt;<i>     that the model's stamp should not change... I'm not sure).
</I>
IMHO the gtk+ documentation says that an iter is only valid as long as the
model doesn't change. If you can assure that the iter is valid after a
change you might not need it but when a node is deleted, the iter of that
node definitly becomes invalid. I think it's good to catch those things
with an assertion before running into a memory corruption.

&gt;<i>   - The iter-&gt;stamp should be initialized to something random,
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise every model
</I>&gt;<i>     starts with stamp == 0 (possibly making the iter from the last
</I>&gt;<i> destroyed signal model
</I>&gt;<i>     appear &quot;valid&quot;)
</I>
I wasn't assuming that someone would use an iter on a wrong model but if
we want to catch that case we might want to start which a random number. I
think we should check what GtkTreeStore does.

&gt;<i>   - I would prefer we stick with firing Glade's generic object
</I>&gt;<i> selection dialog to select
</I>&gt;<i>     the project object for a signal user data - I dont like the idea
</I>&gt;<i> of navigating recursive menus
</I>&gt;<i>     or dropping down a combo box with a possible &gt; 1000 objects to select.
</I>
Yeah, I will change that. I just was easy to implement for now but the UI
is satisfying at all.

Just some additional note: The dnd code currently uses the old gdk_drawing
funtions that have been removed from gtk+. I didn't have the time to
change that as I didn't fully understood how to do that in cairo. But it
shouldn't be a big deal.

Regards,
Johannes
