<PRE>Hi,

since Glade 3.18.3 now works here, here's an update about the issues I
found on Glade 3.16.0:

&gt;<i> Usability:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - It uses some weird theme, and looks completely different than all
</I>&gt;<i>   other GTK+-applications here (btw. I'm not using GNOME but plain fvwm).
</I>&gt;<i>   Maybe the message &quot;GLib-GIO-Message: Using the 'memory' GSettings backend.  Your settings will not be saved or shared with other applications.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>   has something to do with this. Can this be changed, so that some
</I>&gt;<i>   default theme is used?
</I>Solved: The self-compiled Glade looks much more familiar; I don't know
if it's still using a different theme, but I'm much happier with the used
theme now.

&gt;<i> - The layout of the items in the properties-editor became *much* worse.
</I>&gt;<i>   In older versions, most properties used entries or toggle-buttons,
</I>&gt;<i>   and were all positioned vertially below each other.
</I>&gt;<i>   Now, many properties use switches (which I like) and checkboxes.
</I>&gt;<i>   This would be ok, but the layout got very messy: Some properties
</I>&gt;<i>   are positioned below each other, others horizonatlly next to each
</I>&gt;<i>   other, sometimes in 2 columns, sometimes in 3 columns.
</I>&gt;<i>   This makes the layout very messy, confusing and hard to use.
</I>&gt;<i>   In addition, this causes the properties-editor to require more
</I>&gt;<i>   space on the screen, sometimes nearly half (!) of the screen,
</I>&gt;<i>   to show the properties without a horziontal scrollbar (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i>   for GtkScrolledWindow).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   So, I would suggest to improve the layout, make it more clear and
</I>&gt;<i>   use a clear structure, e.g.: Put all properties vertically below
</I>&gt;<i>   each other instead of horizontally next to each other. This would
</I>&gt;<i>   improve usability a lot.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   (The Signals-tab requires even more space (mostly because the Detail-
</I>&gt;<i>   and Handler-column use much space although they are empty), but this
</I>&gt;<i>   is less problematic than with the other tabs.)
</I>No change. (Still bad layout.)

&gt;<i> - In earlier versions, I could shift-click (or ctrl-click?) an item on
</I>&gt;<i>   the palette, an then place this widget multiple times. This was very
</I>&gt;<i>   useful if I had to place e.g. many buttons or labels, but it doesn't
</I>&gt;<i>   work anymore. Could this be added again?
</I>No change. (Still doesn't work.)

&gt;<i> - In addition to the above: If I click on a wiget on the palette, is
</I>&gt;<i>   there any way to abort this without placing the widget? I would
</I>&gt;<i>   suggest to make this possible by e.g. pressing ESC or the
</I>&gt;<i>   mouse-pointer-button on the toolbar.
</I>No change (Still doesn't work.)
I'll create a bugreport for this, since e.g. the mouse-pointer changes to
a normal arrow after clicking on &quot;Select widgets&quot; on the toolbar, but
still a widget is added.

&gt;<i> Bugs:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Glade hangs:
</I>&gt;<i>   Glade often hangs, when dragging a created GtkPaned/GtkScrolledWindow/etc.
</I>&gt;<i>   Glade then only shows a modal window (on all virtual desktops, see
</I>&gt;<i>   attachment), doesn't react anymore, and causes 100% CPU load.
</I>&gt;<i>   In these cases, I have to kill glade (or more exactly: kill
</I>&gt;<i>   /tmp/.mount_Jq1Ok0/home/tristan/Glade/Install/bin/glade).
</I>Maybe this has been resolved; but I have to test this more.

&gt;<i> - Properties editor becomes extremely slow:
</I>&gt;<i>   The properties-editor becomes extremely slow after working with it for
</I>&gt;<i>   some time: When I want to edit the ID of a widget the contents
</I>&gt;<i>   of a label, I sometimes have to type blindly and wait for several
</I>&gt;<i>   seconds (e.g. 8s!), or wait for 1 second (with 100% CPU-load!) after
</I>&gt;<i>   every chacter until the characters appear in the properties-entry!
</I>&gt;<i>   Closing and reopening the Glade-file or restarting Glade usually
</I>&gt;<i>   &quot;solves&quot; this for a while.
</I>I currently don't know if this was solved; if this happens again with
Glade 3.18.3, I'll create a bugreport.

&gt;<i> - Add Parent is broken:
</I>&gt;<i>   &quot;Add Parent&quot; does not work anymore e.g. on GtkFrame, GtkAlignment,
</I>&gt;<i>   GtkGrid, GtkBox etc. For example, if I create a GtkFrame, add a
</I>&gt;<i>   GtkLabel, and then want to add a GtkBox as parent, this doesn't work
</I>&gt;<i>   but shows the error &quot;Widgets of type Alignment need placeholders
</I>&gt;<i>   to add children.&quot; The same error occurs e.g. when trying to add a
</I>&gt;<i>   GtkBox as Parent of a GtkGrid, or a Viewport as Parent to a GtkGrid etc.
</I>&gt;<i>   This worked in Glade 3.12.
</I>&quot;Add Parent&quot; now doesn't create an error-message, but after saving and
reloading the file, the contents of the added GtkScrolledWindow is
completely gone and it's not possible to add anything to the
ScrolledWindow again. So, I'll create a bugreport for this.

&gt;<i> - Missing &quot;GtkImage&quot; in Palette -&gt; Miscellaneous:
</I>&gt;<i>   In the Palette under &quot;Miscellaneous&quot;, &quot;GtkImage&quot; is missing.
</I>No change. I'll create a bugreport for this.

&gt;<i> - Missing &quot;label&quot;-property in GtkLinkButton Properties:
</I>&gt;<i>   There is no way to modify the displayed contents of the linkbutton!
</I>&gt;<i>   The only show &quot;button&quot;, and this cannot be changed in Glade.
</I>&gt;<i>   Workaround: Edit the GtkBuilder-XML-file directly.
</I>No change. I'll create a bugreport for this.

&gt;<i> - Wrong widget in GtkButton Properties -&gt; General -&gt; Add custom content:
</I>&gt;<i>   I think &quot;[ ] Add custom content&quot; should be a radio-button instead of
</I>&gt;<i>   a checkbutton, since it completely behaves like a radiobutton.
</I>No change. I'll create a bugreport for this.

&gt;<i> - GtkButton Images are not shown in Glade:
</I>&gt;<i>   If I create a button including an image, the image is hidden in
</I>&gt;<i>   Glade, unless I click &quot;Always show image&quot;. But this property was
</I>&gt;<i>   introduced in GTK+3.6, and I'm creating a GUI for GTK+3.2, so
</I>&gt;<i>   I cannot use this property.
</I>&gt;<i>   Later, in the application (with GTK+ 3.4), the image is shown
</I>&gt;<i>   correctly, only Glade doesn't show them.
</I>No change. I'll create a bugreport for this.

&gt;<i> - &quot;Select Named Icon&quot; in GtkImage Properties does not find any icons:
</I>&gt;<i>   Selecting the image by &quot;Icon Name&quot; is broken: The &quot;Select Named
</I>&gt;<i>   Icon&quot; does not find any standard-icons. This worked fine in
</I>&gt;<i>   Glade 3.12.
</I>&gt;<i>   (Maybe the folling message has to do with this:
</I>&gt;<i>   &quot;GladeUI-Message: Glade needs artwork; a default icon will be used for the following classes:
</I>&gt;<i>    GtkApplicationWindow needs an icon named 'widget-gtk-applicationwindow'&quot;)
</I>Solved: Does not occur on self-compiled Glade 3.18.3.

&gt;<i> - Duplicate widgets in Properties -&gt; Common -&gt; Widget Spacing -&gt; Expand:
</I>&gt;<i>   &quot;Horizontal&quot; and &quot;Vertical&quot; here have both a checkbutton and a switch.
</I>&gt;<i>   One should be enough, and I would recommend to keep the switch but
</I>&gt;<i>   remove the checkbox.
</I>No change. I'll create a bugreport for this.

&gt;<i> - Preview snapshot sometimes doesn't work:
</I>&gt;<i>   When clicking &quot;Preview snapshot&quot;, I sometimes get an empty window
</I>&gt;<i>   and the assertion:
</I>&gt;<i>   (glade-previewer:8587): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_box_pack: assertion 'gtk_widget_get_parent (child) == NULL' failed
</I>No change. I'll create a bugreport for this.

&gt;<i> - Assertions:
</I>&gt;<i>   I got several assertions. In my understanding, assertions should only
</I>&gt;<i>   be used for coding errors, and not for unexpected input.
</I>&gt;<i>   Here's a list of some assertions, I got:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   (glade:8214): GladeUI-CRITICAL **: glade_project_selection_clear: assertion 'GLADE_IS_PROJECT (project)' failed
</I>&gt;<i>   (glade:13717): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_status_icon_set_from_file: assertion 'filename != NULL' failed
</I>&gt;<i>   (glade:13717): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_status_icon_set_from_stock: assertion 'stock_id != NULL' failed
</I>&gt;<i>   (glade:13717): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_status_icon_set_from_icon_name: assertion 'icon_name != NULL' failed
</I>I did not get such assertions yet; I'll create bugreports if I do again.

Roland
