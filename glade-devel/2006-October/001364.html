The GObject boilerplate problem is a definitely a drawback of this
design. However I think the benefits of the design greatly outweigh the
negatives. I think we can come up with creative solutions to minimise
the need to unnecessarily write boilerplate.  

We can help C plugin authors by providing a simple, no-frills
script that generates GObject boilerplate. The script will take a few
parameters and will output GObject boilerplate. Similarly, the gedit
developers have a script that creates a GObject plugin skeleton for
their plugin architecture.

We could also have some adaptors handle common widgets. For example, a
GladeDialogAdapter could handle a GtkColorSelection, GtkFileChooser,
etc, by using case programming. By 'case' I mean that GladeDialogAdapter
will change it's behaviour depending on what type of widget it is
adapting. While this is not considered &quot;good&quot; OO, it does balance the
need for an object-orientated architecture with the need for fast and
efficient programming.

Vincent
