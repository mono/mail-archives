</I>Yes, it is &quot;monkeying&quot; gazpacho (if you say so) and /all/ the other gui
designers that have a single window design. I don't know if you have
noticed, but there aren't exactly many gui designers that have a
multiple window design. I can't think of any myself (besides glade).
KDesigner, Visual Studio, Netbeans, Gazpacho, and Gideon are just
prominent examples of gui designers that use the single window design. I
think that says something about the popularity (and hence usability) of
the single-window design. 

Right now that 10% is you alone. No one else has come to us to voice
dissatisfaction with the new design. Hopefully, this thread will
encourage others to come forward to voice their concerns.


&gt;<i> But I wonder, have someone actually tried to work with such
</I>&gt;<i> UI? I did, in gazpacho, and it sucked. You can't use glade
</I>&gt;<i> right now because of fancy bugs with click-does-nothing.
</I>&gt;<i> So people &quot;commented&quot; on how it looks, not on the actual
</I>&gt;<i> interface.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Yes, thats right, we are now in unstable development. If you want to use
glade3 for production use, please use the glade3 3.0.2 stable
release :).


&gt;<i> Heh, &quot;excellent&quot;. Well, let's call gdl excellent or even usable. Still,
</I>&gt;<i> it has nothing to with glade, right? So, we can snip last two
</I>&gt;<i> paragraphs, and stick to 10% thing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I was mentioning it as a possible solution to your valid concerns about
the shortcomings of the new ui (namely the inflexibility of the tree and
props editor).
