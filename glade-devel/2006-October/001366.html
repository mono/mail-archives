<PRE>I guess this has been brought up many times before, but I'm new to this
list and missed the discussions.

What I wonder is why source code generation is deprecated? Is it just
that the code in glade was deprecated (not up to date and not
maintained perhaps) or is the whole idea of generating code considered
deprecated? I think it's nice. But would really prefer to have a
command line tool to do the job (so I actually have nothing against it
being removed from glade). Is there any reason why I shouldn't get
going and create such a tool right away?
