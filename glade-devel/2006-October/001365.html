I like the idea of doing both - maybe GladeWidgetClass can be made GObject
and can be derived in some binding like python, or its vfuncs can be 
specified in
the catalog... in which case we might be able to do something fancly 
like generating
a derived type for that  GladeWidgetClass,  effectively offloading the 
complexity
of derivation to the GType system.

If we don't feel like being that fancy we might try having an optional 
adaptor
object provided for that GladeWidgetClass and C libraries would continue
to work the same way.

Cheers,
