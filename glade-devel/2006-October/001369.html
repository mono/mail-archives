<PRE>Hello all,

I posted this message below, yesterday (on other gtk related group), and 
was hinted into the direction of this newsgroup. My problem was to find 
glade-catalog.dtd as refered to by 
<A HREF="http://glade.gnome.org/docs/catalogintro.html.">http://glade.gnome.org/docs/catalogintro.html.</A>

Tristan indicated to try my luck here, and pointed me into the direction 
of the glade 'repository'. My follow-on question is : where can I find 
the glade3 CVS repository (I think that Tristan meant the *CVS* 
repository) ? I do not find a link on the homepage, apart from tarballs. 
But the file is not in there ! Google doesn't help me much neither...

Another question related to it is that I don't have any online help in 
my glade installation itself (rpm packaged by SuSE). So I consider 
installing a more recent version. But if I do, how can I be sure that my 
existing plugin (Ada code generation plugin, which I would hate to lose) 
won't disappear ? Of if it does, how can I find it back and install/copy 
it to it's new place ? As far as I understand from the glade 
documentation on the glade site, the plugin is 'only' a catalog file and 
a plugin library. But where are they so that I can eventually reinstall 
them in the correct location (or: how can I find out where they are 
located now) ?

Kind regards,

PhB

&gt;&gt;<i> While reading <A HREF="http://glade.gnome.org/docs/catalogintro.html">http://glade.gnome.org/docs/catalogintro.html</A> I see it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is possible to validate any catalog file against a glade DTD (excerpt 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> : &quot;xmllint --dtdvalid glade-catalog.dtd --noout my-catalog.xml&quot;). 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, I have not found this file called &quot;glade-catalog.dtd&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes this is a packaging problem (not sure if its in bugzilla yet), the
</I>&gt;<i> file can however be found in the glade3 repository at
</I>&gt;<i>     glade3/widgets/glade-catalog.dtd
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (yes its currently missing from the built tarballs :-/)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The catalog dtd is... err... not very maintained and I'm not sure
</I>&gt;<i> how much good it will do you either.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Feel free to ask for help with your catalog on the glade-devel list.
