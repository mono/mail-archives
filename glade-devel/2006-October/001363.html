    I guess I was imaginig a case where it was impossible to have everything
in the same memory space - I guess thats just foolish, I dont know.

</I>
What I mean here is - if we go ahead and use an &quot;adapter class&quot; route in 
glade,
it would be pointless if glade-gtk.c were to be written in C (in C is 
obviously more
convenient to only supply the callbacks needed for a particular class 
via the xml
file, otherwise a boiler plate code would have to be written in C for 
every single
widget that had anything non-default, any method to override - a 
painfull and needless
overhead for the C plugin author).

On the other hand, can we write the gtk+/gnome plugin in python ? and still
be portable on win32 ? ... i.e. will python be portable everywhere gtk+ is ?

Cheers,
                                -Tristan
