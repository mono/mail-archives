</I>&gt;<i>
</I>This is irrelevant because:
1) So what?
2) Glade is there and works fine;
3) Adobe Photoshop is the best graphics ever, and uses single
window design. Its single window thing is still horror (this is about
&quot;others do this&quot;);
4) etc.

I am saying that glade is hard to use with single window; you are
saying that this hard-to-use property is everywhere, so glade should
be hard to use too.

&gt;<i>I can't think of any myself (besides glade).
</I>&gt;<i>KDesigner, Visual Studio, Netbeans, Gazpacho, and Gideon are just
</I>&gt;<i>prominent examples of gui designers that use the single window design. I
</I>&gt;<i>think that says something about the popularity (and hence usability) of
</I>&gt;<i>the single-window design. 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Netbeans, Gazpacho, and Gideon are not &quot;prominent&quot; examples
of anything. And no, it doesn't say anything about popularity.
Something can be popular or not popular if there is a choice.
If there's a choice between two things equivalent in all but one detail,
then you can talk about popularity of that one detail. But come on,
how can you say that single-window is popular because KDesigner
is used a lot? Of course KDesigner is used by all KDE folks, it's
the only kde ui designer. And of course no one would rewrite
a thing written by *QT* just because he wants fancier windows.
And, let me guess, QT uses single-window because it's how it
should be on Windows. Not because of some usability studies
or some &quot;popularity&quot;.

&gt;<i>Right now that 10% is you alone. No one else has come to us to voice
</I>&gt;<i>dissatisfaction with the new design. Hopefully, this thread will
</I>&gt;<i>encourage others to come forward to voice their concerns.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>*Users* do not read this list. *Developers* are likely to like any
fancy stuff they see.

&gt;&gt;<i>But I wonder, have someone actually tried to work with such
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>UI? I did, in gazpacho, and it sucked. You can't use glade
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>right now because of fancy bugs with click-does-nothing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>So people &quot;commented&quot; on how it looks, not on the actual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>interface.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Yes, thats right, we are now in unstable development. If you want to use
</I>&gt;<i>glade3 for production use, please use the glade3 3.0.2 stable
</I>&gt;<i>release :).
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>You didn't address the point here - no one commented on
*usability* of single window layout. I questioned &quot;10%&quot; percents
thing (not that I think majority likes multiple windows, I also
heard many people have resolution bigger than 1024x768).

&gt;&gt;<i>Heh, &quot;excellent&quot;. Well, let's call gdl excellent or even usable. Still,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>it has nothing to with glade, right? So, we can snip last two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>paragraphs, and stick to 10% thing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I was mentioning it as a possible solution to your valid concerns about
</I>&gt;<i>the shortcomings of the new ui (namely the inflexibility of the tree and
</I>&gt;<i>props editor).
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It is not a possible solution, because glade will not depend on gdl,
or will it?

Yevgen
