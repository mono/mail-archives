Hi Philippe,
    sorry I wasnt more clear about the glade3 repository, and
sorry I havent taken the time to update glade.gnome.org to
reflect the current cvs root and branch state.

Glade is in the GNOME cvs repository as the 'glade3' module,
instructions and information about the GNOME repository can
be found here: <A HREF="http://developer.gnome.org/tools/cvs.html">http://developer.gnome.org/tools/cvs.html</A>

Currently stable development of glade has been branched
into the 'glade3-3-0-branch'

so you'll want to &quot;cvs co -r glade3-3-0-branch glade3&quot; with
the correct $CVSROOT set.

&gt;<i> Another question related to it is that I don't have any online help in 
</I>&gt;<i> my glade installation itself (rpm packaged by SuSE). So I consider 
</I>&gt;<i> installing a more recent version. But if I do, how can I be sure that my 
</I>&gt;<i> existing plugin (Ada code generation plugin, which I would hate to lose) 
</I>&gt;<i> won't disappear ? Of if it does, how can I find it back and install/copy 
</I>&gt;<i> it to it's new place ? As far as I understand from the glade 
</I>&gt;<i> documentation on the glade site, the plugin is 'only' a catalog file and 
</I>&gt;<i> a plugin library. But where are they so that I can eventually reinstall 
</I>&gt;<i> them in the correct location (or: how can I find out where they are 
</I>&gt;<i> located now) ?
</I>
Glade 3 has no code generation, and no ada plugin - the package you are
working with on SuSE is Glade 2 - the plugin that is spoken of in the
documentation refers to a plugin that provides a widget kit
(the gtk+ and gnome catalogs are implemented as plugins for instance).

Installing the Glade 3 tarball will also install the gtk+ and gnome
plugins (i.e. you will have widgets in the palette).

Cheers,
                    -Tristan
