</I>It's not a good design, it's monkying gazpacho. Anyway,
I just wanted to make sure that you know about those &quot;10%&quot;.
If majority loves single window, then you of course go single
window.
But I wonder, have someone actually tried to work with such
UI? I did, in gazpacho, and it sucked. You can't use glade
right now because of fancy bugs with click-does-nothing.
So people &quot;commented&quot; on how it looks, not on the actual
interface.

&gt;<i>With regard to your concerns about the constraints on the props editor
</I>&gt;<i>and tree, I think the excellent libgdl docking widgets can satisy that
</I>&gt;<i>problem. Then one can simply drag out the props editor into a window of
</I>&gt;<i>it's own, and then expand it as much as one likes. As such, with libgdl
</I>&gt;<i>it would be very possible to emulate the old multiple-window glade.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>However, we can't use the libgdl library as it is above gtk+ in the
</I>&gt;<i>stack and as it seems to be orientated towards the needs of the Anjuta
</I>&gt;<i>developers. I am very keen on working on gdl though, towards the goal of
</I>&gt;<i>making it suitable for our needs.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Heh, &quot;excellent&quot;. Well, let's call gdl excellent or even usable. Still,
it has nothing to with glade, right? So, we can snip last two
paragraphs, and stick to 10% thing.

Best regards,
Yevgen
