I dont think thats right, are there any apps that work that way ?

</I>
I was thinking somthing like this:

==========================================================
g_signal_connect (... &quot;key-press-event&quot;, my_handler... );

/* ... */

my_handler () {
     /* call the centralized key handleing logic */
     glade_key_event_handle (... event args..., &quot;key source&quot;);
}
==========================================================

where &quot;key source&quot; could be:

enum {
     KEYSRC_GWIDGET,
     KEYSRC_PLACEHOLDER,
     KEYSRC_PROJECT_WINDOW
     ... etc etc...
}

It would be the responsability of the calling code to setup its own
event signal handler, only it would call a centralized function to
take care of what gets done at that point.

Cheers,
                                   -Tristan
