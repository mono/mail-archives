I couldnt figure it out in that way, but Im a novice when it comes to
gtk.  In any case, a signal handler is going to have to be installed
for the widgets in the windows created by the project, where its done
automatically for the project window with the GtkItemFactoryEntry,
right? Does that force it to be done in more than one place?

Also as an after thought, in the future might it desireable to have
different undos for specific windows? E.x. undo in the property editor
undoes entries into the fields of the property editor, whereas undo
undoes creation/deletion/etc of widgets when the focus is on the
windows created by the project.

Maybe it would still be a good Idea to put all the callbacks that
house that logic in one file in any case?
