</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Does this explanation solve the issue ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Almost. It sure helps though.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Let me explain how the glade-anjuta integration works, so that it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be more clear what the problem is. There are 3 ways that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> integration creates code to help the programmer: automatic member
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> widgets generation and callback generation (two different ways). I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recommend you to try anjuta, create a gtk application project, open
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the callbacks.[ch] files and the .ui file to better see how the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> integration works. Now, let me explain what anjuta does on automatic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> callback/member widgets generation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For automatic member widgets generation the user must double click a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> widget (actually any object, but I'll call it widget for now) on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> glade inspector. When that happens, code will automatically be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> created
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to include this widget as a private member of the associated class.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The name of the member is the same of the widget. So, if the widget
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has no id strange things happens.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So at this point, instead of strange things happening, anjuta can
</I>&gt;<i> either set or 'ensure' the name of the widget when trapping this double
</I>&gt;<i> click.
</I>
Ok. I think that is doable. I just wanted it to be done on the glade
side, so that it wouldn't be needed to be done again for
gnome-builder.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For automatic callback generation there are two ways to do it: the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> user drags and drops a signal from glade to the source code editor
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where it is wanted the callback to be created or the user
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> double-clicks the signal name and the callback code is automatically
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> created on the file of the associated class. The first parameter of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the callback has the same name of the widget. So, if the widget has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> id strange things happens.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which signal does the GladeSignalEditor emit that includes a widget
</I>&gt;<i> name ?
</I>
When dropping a signal, the name of the widget comes from
<A HREF="https://git.gnome.org/browse/glade/tree/gladeui/glade-signal-model.c#n957">https://git.gnome.org/browse/glade/tree/gladeui/glade-signal-model.c#n957</A>
. When the signal is double-clicked, the same information is generated
in anjuta in <A HREF="https://git.gnome.org/browse/anjuta/tree/plugins/language-support-cpp-java/plugin.c#n807">https://git.gnome.org/browse/anjuta/tree/plugins/language-support-cpp-java/plugin.c#n807</A>
.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I cannot find one in Glade and suspect that Anjuta is using a custom
</I>&gt;<i> derived signal editor for this purpose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again the same applies, in response to a user activity Anjuta is free
</I>&gt;<i> to set or ensure a name on a widget that needs to have one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Before continuing, I should note that undo/redo is an inherently
</I>&gt;<i> difficult thing to handle, I dont know if Anjuta does undo/redo, or how
</I>&gt;<i> well it is equipped to integrate with undo stacks in plugins.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ideally though, any action which involves both:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   a.) Some code added to a project buffer
</I>&gt;<i>   b.) Some change that occurs in a Glade project
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> in a single user action, should be undoable/redoable in a single step.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Undo/redo after that point should safely/seamlessly repeat that
</I>&gt;<i> interleaved activity as one single action.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That is the ideal behavior and that is not how it is done currently.
Not a big problem though.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From what I see, glade_widget_ensure_name creates a name for a widget
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if it does not have one. This seems very good, but we would have the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> call it before anjuta receives the signals to create member widgets
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> callbacks. I think the best way to solve the issue is for glade the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> call glade_widget_ensure_name on widgets before anjuta does anything
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with id-less widgets. If you do not oppose it, I'll implement this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> change. Do you agree wit it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I doubt that I agree.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It sounds like you would want Glade to introduce some behavior that
</I>&gt;<i> silently names widgets without the user really understanding what is
</I>&gt;<i> going on.
</I>
The behavior would be enabled only when running from an IDE.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are you suggesting that if a user double clicks on a row in the
</I>&gt;<i> inspector in Glade (not in Anjuta), then the project will get littered
</I>&gt;<i> with names that are unneeded ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
My plan is that if the user double-clicks an id-less widget on glade
inspector (when running on an IDE), then it would automatically gain a
name.

&gt;<i> Maybe this is not what you mean but I havent really figured it out, can
</I>&gt;<i> you suggest something that will not have a side effect of unwanted
</I>&gt;<i> names appearing in user projects for no reason ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
No, I can't. Maybe it should be handled on the IDE side of things
then. Just to confirm: you find it better that the IDE handle
automatic naming of widgets, is that right?
