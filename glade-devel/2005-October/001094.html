Hmmm, do you think this bug is related:
   <A HREF="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=310143">http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=310143</A> ?

For some reason, I havent got a dynamic GtkRadioMenuIem group
to function properly.

&gt;<i> * Accelerators ???????
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Clicking over a menuitem selects the GladeWidget but do not let the
</I>&gt;<i> menuitem be activated except for the first one (middle click works OK)
</I>&gt;<i> Any idea?
</I>
Hmmm, maybe the logic around glade_widget_retrieve_from_position(); is
borked, just a hunch...

&gt;<i> * GktImage: in glade-3 the &quot;file&quot; property is used as the filename
</I>&gt;<i> instead of &quot;pixbuf&quot; as is in glade-2 :(
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe we are going to need some sort of &quot;alias&quot; property tag to fix
</I>&gt;<i> this.
</I>
I think that we just need to implement &quot;filename&quot; properties better;
we should have a filechooser button for them... we'll just need to
give it a little thought as to where the file is to be retrieved
by glade-3/Anjuta and where it is to be retrieved by libglade/gtk+.

One other thing I noticed is that GtkImage &quot;type&quot; doesn't seem to be
resolved properly on the load :
(i.e. type = filename || icon theme || stock )

I wonder if I broke that while writing glade-editor-property.c or
maybe you broke it with &quot;GtkImage loading fixes&quot;, I'll let you know
after taking a look at the code :-/

&gt;<i> * Properties are not set insensitive when a project is loaded.
</I>
I dont think I follow; when I have one project open (with a selected
widget) and I load a second project; the selected widget is cleared
and I have nothing in the property editor.

&gt;<i> Not related with menus:
</I>&gt;<i> It seems project manipulation (load/save open/close) is unstable.
</I>&gt;<i> For example, If you close every project and try to save, it will crash.
</I>&gt;<i> (active_project is not valid)
</I>
Ok, the code should be protected from those crashes; and arguably,
the save/undo/redo buttons should be insensitive when no projects
are loaded.

I'll try to get a fix in today; if I dont have time I'll bugzilla it.

&gt;<i> Also if you have more than one project open at the same time and you try
</I>&gt;<i> to select some widget from the project view sometimes it crash or widget
</I>&gt;<i> properties do not appear in the property editor (they do if you select
</I>&gt;<i> the widget itself).
</I>
The graphist here at touchtunes has been experiencing similar problems;
but he says that sometimes glade-3 crashes when using left-click
selection on the widgets, he always uses right-click &quot;select&quot; via
the widget tree to avoid crashes. (since we're using a custom toolkit
plugin and the tool is running large/complex projects for long periods
of time and I cant get any steps to reproduce it, its not in bugzilla)

It would be great if you could find out a way to reproduce the crash
consistantly :-/

I'll take a closer look at the actual patch and probably get it into
cvs later on today.

Cheers,
                                -Tristan
