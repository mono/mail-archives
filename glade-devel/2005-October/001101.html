     Since you are embedding all of this functionality into the
actual treeview, which I think is a good approach; no need to
re-use the project-view code.

Basicly; If you create your GladeEditorProperties with the
use_command arg as TRUE, then all property changes will be stacked
on the undo/redo stack; in either case, the property values will
be applied to the object real-time, other than that; just make
sure that all menu items are removed/created through the
glade_command API.

I think that its pretty pointless to have an Apply/Cancel button;
glade-2 had it but didn't have undo/redo, so there was purpose.

&gt;&gt;<i>Regardless if you wait on me or not; please let me know what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>you think of the plan, this is a good time to &quot;get it right the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>first time&quot; :)

</I>&gt;<i> widget from the project-view)... well in that case it is a great idea.
</I>
Hmmm,
     I think its probably best for custom editors to be mutually
exclusive with the default glade editor (shouldn't be able to modify
properties add or delete widgets while the editor is in use).

Cheers,
                             -Tristan
