<PRE>I clean forgot to send a mail to this list when sending a mail
to gnome-announce last week... So I give you:

=================

Hi,
     This is the first ever development snapshot of glade-3, after years 
of hard work, blood, sweat... you know the deal... we bring you the 
beginnings of what I'm sure will be a great product of the community.


* What is glade-3
=================


     Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick &amp; easy development of user 
interfaces
for the Gtk+ toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment. The user interfaces
designed in Glade are stored in XML format, enabling easy integration with
external tools. In particular libglade can load the XML files and create the
interfaces at runtime.


This version of Glade (Glade-3) is a complete rewrite of the original 
Glade codebase.


     One of the main differnces from glade-2 is that C code generation 
has been removed:
this has been done on purpose, since using generated code is deprecated; 
the preferred
way to use glade files is with libglade (if code generation is needed, 
this can be provided
as another tool or plugin, code generation is simply not a part of the 
glade-3 project).
Another main difference is that glade-3 was designed to make maximal use 
of GObject
introspection, thus easing the integration of external toolkits and 
handling widgets,
signals and properties genericly; thus making it easier to write fancy 
features in the
future (toolkits such as gtk+ itself, gnome, gnome-db and any others are 
implemented
externaly as widget catalogs with optional support libraries, thus 
catalogs may be
distributed seperatly; possibly along with their libglade support modules).


It has a few useful new features such as stacked Undo/Redo and Multiple 
Project support
and respects the same XML format as glade-2.



==============
glade-3 2.90.0
==============


What is new in glade-3 2.90.0
=============================


     Everything about glade-3 is definitly new in this first ever
development snapshot, so I give you here a list of all the
all star players that helped up to this point to make it happen
(anyone I have any kind of record of should be here).


Contributors:
=============
    Chema Celorio, Jonathan Blandford, Carlos Perello Marin,
    Archit Baweja, Ravi Pratap, Shane Butler, Joe Shaw, Kjartan Maraas,
    Michael Meeks, James Willcox, Joaqu&#237;n Cuenca Abela, Paolo Borelli,
    Tommi Komulainen, Damon Chaplin, David Hoover, Morten Welinder,
    Tristan Van Berkom, Ivan Wong, Gustavo Noronha Silva, Richard Hult
    Mikael Hallendal, Naba Kumar, Philip Van Hoof, Juan Pablo Ugarte


Translators:
============
   Fatih Demir, Christian Rose, Pablo Saratxaga, Duarte Loreto,
   Zbigniew Chyla, Hasbullah Bin Pit, Takeshi AIHANA



And here's a list of the major missing parts of glade-3:


      - i18n'ness still needs to be finished (Richard Hult already got a
        great deal done here)


      - Write custom menu editor and toolbar editor (and implement plugin
        entry point for custom editors)


      - Add the rest of the Gtk+ widgets and implement good plugin code
        for them where needed (including the non GtkWidget classes)


      - Add Gnome widget catalog


      - Need to streamline button-press-events on runtime widgets better,
        widgets like GtkEntry seem to eat up mouse clicks without us getting
        a chance to treat them (especially noticable when dealing with 
GtkFixed
        or GtkLayout children), glade-2 seems to handle this nicely, so 
there
        must be a way...


Ofcourse there are alot of other minor bugs lying around and alot of bugs
that I hope will be reported to bugzilla after releasing this snapshot :)


* Where can I get it ?
