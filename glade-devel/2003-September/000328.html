Hi David!

Here is a couple of info to get you started:

- the current maintainer is Joaquin Cuenca Abela
- to submit patches, send them to this list (patches should include
ChangeLog); at some point it may happen that Joaqin decide to give you
write access to cvs, but also in that case non-trivial patches should be
discussed here.
- other people beside Joaquin who made changes to glade3 lately are
Archit Baweja (bighead on irc) and me (pbor on irc).

To get a brief overview of the sources you may read my last week message
to this list in the thread &quot;Offer to help out&quot;.

The pending stuff that I think it's being worked on, but still not
committed is:
- Menu Editor (Archit)
- Finish the changes to glade-widget-class and glade-catalog (Joaquin)

Beside what is listed in the TODO file, some of the major changes that
we would like to do longer term are:
- make additionl catalogs really pluggable: this means having
glade-gtk.so, glade-gnome.so, glade-gnome-db.so etc... currently we only
have gtk widgets and we lack infrastructure to get the catalogs at run
time (see the hack in glade-gtk.c for details)
- split glade3 itself in a library that can be used by other IDE like
anjuta and scaffold; in terms of code refactoring this should not be
much work since it is already really modular (e.g. nothing but main
includes glade-project-window.h which is our top level shell), but
requires knowledge of the autotools vodoo ;)

Other than that, what we really need is to make all the widgets on the
palette work and that we manage to make glade3 read all the projects
created with glade2, at least the ones that only use gtk. For example
I've been struggling with the attribute &quot;internal child&quot; that you can
find in any of the dialogs created with glade-2... I even have a
half-done patch, but I've not been able to get a working solution.

For every doubt, question, whatever feel free to ask.

ciao
	paolo


PS: I felt compelled to replay since I'm the one who made the
suggestion, but keep in mind that I'm quite a newby ;)
I hope that, if needed, more authoritative people (Joaquin and Archit)
will reply.
