Thats great!
(btw, I hope you enjoyed your trip)

fine by me, I wrote glade-gtk.so just because the file is glade-gtk.c.

I can try to come up with a list later, but for what I saw, some of the
problems are general, not peculiar of each widget. The main one that I
found is that of &quot;internal-child&quot;, i.e. widgets which have some childs
which should be handled internally (e.g. the vbox of a dialog)
This problem affect most of the &quot;composite&quot; widgets, like GtkDialog,
GtkPaned, etc.

Another (easier) issue is that the gtk_widget_fill_empty function does
not work properly, so some containers do not have placeholders and you
can't add widgets to them. Fill empty cannot be hadled sanely in a
generic function, it should become a method of GladeWidgetClass.
I had a patch for this (if I still find it), but I kept it on hold since
it's touching the glade-widget-class code you were reworking.
It should also be noted that this problem has interactions with the
&quot;internal-child&quot; problem.

GtkDialog (which is one of the most used widgets) has also other
problems:
- when one is created a dialog should query which kind of buttons the
user wants (see glade2), but we only have the code to do numerical
queries.
- there is the problem of the response-id attribute of the buttons in a
dialog, which I don't know how to handle.
