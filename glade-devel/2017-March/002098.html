<PRE>Hi LRN!

Although I'm no longer an active contributor, I was the developer of
the original glade-preview app. I'd really love see it get advanced
features but I'm not willing to do it myself. If you found a
reproducible crash on glade, I'd recommend you to file a bug on
gnome's bugzilla; also, try to talk to Juan Pablo Ugarte and Tristan
about new ideas involving glade.

A long time ago, I worked on the integration between glade and Anjuta.
It worked pretty fine for a time but, currently, it crashes. The
workflow was very good while it worked. Anjuta development has been
stagnant recently and gnome-builder seems to be the gnome IDE where
development is happening. I talked to Christian Hergert (gnome-builder
main developer) about glade integration on gnome-builder and he seemed
supportive of it. So, if you're interested in doing something really
great for glade, I'd recommend you to start integrating it on
gnome-builder.

I don't think changing glade architecture around glade-previewer would
make it easier to debug.

</I>&gt;<i> either into GTK itself, or into the slave process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that crashes will be easier to deal with that way, as Glade won't have
</I>&gt;<i> to juggle both widgets and their meta-structure at the same time. Also,
</I>&gt;<i> extending Glade to support new GTK widgets will be easier.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, this might or might not bring some benefits to GtkInspector, depending on
</I>&gt;<i> how much of that code goes into GTK, making it available to Inspector.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does this make sense? Was this already considered during previous Glade
</I>&gt;<i> rewrites? If yes, why was it discarded? Thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. This proposal was not well-received on #gtk+, so there's that.
