<PRE>Dear Tristan,

In that case, perhaps I'll give the history feature a swing someday
soon.

I actually have some (I think) good ideas for the Glade project, but I
want to dive into the code a little bit before I get ahead of myself.
However, I'm glad to hear that you guys need the help, because I'm
willing to offer whatever I can.

I'll also check out the bugzilla for some more accurate information on
the project's direction.

Thanks,
-Andrew

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and your second point brings a neat idea to mind.  Should session
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; management and project state information be tied together.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In otherwords, each project carries with it information about the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; management now implemented in the latest glade 2.6.x.  I can imagine
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; .gladep files for this information.  What are peoples thoughts about this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There was a few threads a week or two ago on glade-users about 
</I>&gt;<i> session-management that IMO should set the standard of how we should
</I>&gt;<i> approach this beast.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
