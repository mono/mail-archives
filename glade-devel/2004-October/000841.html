<PRE>	good day,
	developers. i realy want to contribute to glade3 project, but before
you decide who the new maintainer will be (or i missed that :/ ?) i
think that there *are* some more things to do:

	i would like the create the new design (professional?) of
<A HREF="http://glade.gnome.org">http://glade.gnome.org</A> site and bring it to php. administration/news
posting, etc. would be so much easier. other thing i would like to do is
redesing the glade logo and `created by glade` button. there are so many
apps that use glade, but the current button is so ugly that not so many
put it on their sites (or just dont know abou it - `spread the glade`).
i want to do all this just to bring more atention to glade and its power
in app developing. i can do mockups over weekend. what do you think?

	bye,
	vladeck.
