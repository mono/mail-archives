<PRE>I agree that somebody needs to be applying patches or the project will
grind to a halt. Already there are some patches in CVS that have comment
saying &quot;this works!&quot; etc waiting to be applied.
If one or two people like David want to be maintainers, I think that
would be great. It is important to have an active maintainer. I know I
certainly don't have time to be a maintainer but am happy to help out in
other ways.
Regards, Shane

</I>&gt;<i> Tristan has been doing some work on things, I have a few things I'm

</I>&gt;<i> maintaining a slew of uncommitted patches in bugzilla waiting for
</I>&gt;<i> approval/application will get unwieldy fairly quickly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since development has been mostly stagnated for the past quarter of a
</I>&gt;<i> year, I would like to step up to the plate and take maintainership
</I>&gt;<i> responsibilities. I am willing (if they are) to participate in patch
</I>&gt;<i> review with some of the other people who have had commit approval in the
</I>&gt;<i> past (Damon, Paolo, Shane, etc), or if people are comfortable, I can
</I>&gt;<i> tackle patch review myself; if in the future someone stepped up with a
</I>&gt;<i> strong opposition to my actions, there would always be cvs history in
</I>&gt;<i> order to remove things.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I fear that without someone at the reigns to review and apply patches,
</I>&gt;<i> this newfound burst of activity will quickly die; I know that if I went
</I>&gt;<i> for weeks building up a large number of sets of unapplied-patches that
</I>&gt;<i> needed to be managed, I would quickly lose interest in working on
</I>&gt;<i> glade-3 (for instance, my recent patch which added api documentation
</I>&gt;<i> would be a godsend for me while working on other fixes, but if that doc
</I>&gt;<i> patch had not been applied already, I would need to constantly revert it
</I>&gt;<i> before building the unique patches for other fixes)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Admittedly, I'm not the most experienced person in maintainership, nor
</I>&gt;<i> the most familiar with the current glade-3 code base, but I am willing
</I>&gt;<i> to work at it, do my best, and acclimate over time. As it stands now, it
</I>&gt;<i> appears that nobody else wants the job or has the time for it, and I'd
</I>&gt;<i> much rather see some progress, even if it is slightly shaky at first,
</I>&gt;<i> rather than a potentially exciting project laying fallow.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I welcome any responses to this, and if people are interested, we can
</I>&gt;<i> set up a meeting in IRC to discuss the matter further. For now, I will
</I>&gt;<i> tentatively propose a meeting in #glade3 on irc.gimp.org on Friday,
</I>&gt;<i> October 15th. I'm not sure what timezones people are in, other than that
</I>&gt;<i> I am in UTC -0700 and Tristan is UTC -0400, so sometime in the North
</I>&gt;<i> American work day would probably be best for the two of us. For now, let
</I>&gt;<i> me suggest 17:00 UTC aka 13:00 EDT aka 10:00 PDT.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please send me email off list if you're interested in coming (or even if
</I>&gt;<i> you're not) and let me also know if that time is acceptable for you. I
</I>&gt;<i> will corral that information &amp; post ASAP with updates to that.
