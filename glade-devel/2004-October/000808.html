Yeah, well, I can try help out now and then :)  Currently I'm still
working on better GtkNotebook support (already posted a patch but
discovered its more complicated than that to be like glade-2). No CVS
account currently.

Actually some of the tasks will be reasonable size, I think. The menu
editor is probably going to take a bit of work, for example. Anyway, I
find a good way to find bugs is if you try something in glade-2 then in
glade-3. Also saving something from glade-2 and open in glade-3. Or
repeating the same steps in both and checking the .glade file that
results at save time. Those sorts of things...

&gt;<i>       * Speaking of bugzilla, should the items in the TODO file get

</I>
I agree, that would be nice.

&gt;<i>       * Who has access to/maintains the web pages at glade.gnome.org?
</I>
Hmm... I dont think the webpage currently needs to have anything to do
with glade-3 at this early stage, apart from maybe a call for
developers??

BTW, its nice to see some activity!

Cheers, Shane
