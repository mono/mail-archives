<PRE>Wow,
   slowly but surely more and more people are taking interest in this project,
thats great to hear :)

    First of all, I'd like to say that the TODO file is a handy
reference for us
right now, but no; we haven't been keeping it up-to-date.

David Hoover sent a mail just recently to this list describing our agreed
roadmap, and created some bugzilla entries to track the items on our
upcomming milestones.

&gt;<i> I don't think anyone has started work on file opened history feature,
</I>&gt;<i> but i could be wrong.
</I>
Unless they failed to mention it to us, then you are correct; nobody has 
taken this task up yet.

As for treeview bugs/enhancements, I think that David was going to look
into that, but you should work that out with him (I'm not sure that he's jumped
into that yet).

&gt;<i> and your second point brings a neat idea to mind.  Should session
</I>&gt;<i> management and project state information be tied together.
</I>&gt;<i> In otherwords, each project carries with it information about the
</I>&gt;<i> position of each of its windows and information about the structure of
</I>&gt;<i> the Widget heirarchy.  This is much different then the session
</I>&gt;<i> management now implemented in the latest glade 2.6.x.  I can imagine
</I>&gt;<i> using the 
</I>&gt;<i> .gladep files for this information.  What are peoples thoughts about this?
</I>
There was a few threads a week or two ago on glade-users about 
session-management that IMO should set the standard of how we should
approach this beast.

Cheers,
                                             -Tristan
