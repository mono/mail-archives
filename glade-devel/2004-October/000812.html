That is nice, however what I was talking about was support of the
UIManager in the projects created with glade3, not in the glade3 GUI
itself :)

&gt;<i> Once I have completed this I plan on implementing the recent files

Please don't: this has been discussed in the past and the decision was
to not add it since it only works on linux+gnome, while we want glade3
to work out of the box on win32. As a matter of fact ypu can see that
glade3 depends only on gtk+ and not on libgnome etc.
Of course you could do

#ifdef GNOME
...
#else
...
#endif

But since glade3 has still many more important things to do, I'd prefer
to drop this feature in favour of code cleanliness.
