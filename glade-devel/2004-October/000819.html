Understood, I'll send emails with links to patches in bugzilla.

</I>&gt;<i> I can understand your pain... usually the procedure to get cvs write

</I>&gt;<i> clearly makes this procedure more difficult.

</I>&gt;<i> cvs.gnome.org that switched to it (Rhythmbox, MLView,...).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since you for now you have to keep a patchset against upstream, I
</I>&gt;<i> suggest you to only make strictly needed changes leaving out coding
</I>&gt;<i> style changes and other noise.
</I>
Yes, 
     I'm just trying to get the code inline and readable (in whatever coding
style, as long as it is consistant) in order to do some real work, you do
get my drift... But I agree I'll just have to suffer untill this gets
a little easier...
but it really pains me :-/

&gt;<i> With regard to long lines, I find really looooong lines annoying too,
</I>&gt;<i> but at the same time things like
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> function_name
</I>&gt;<i>         (arg, arg)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> are IMHO just plain ugly and I find that solution way worse than the
</I>&gt;<i> long line itself. After all it's 2004 and we can well expect people to
</I>&gt;<i> use an editor/terminal which is not limited to 80 cols ;-)
</I>
Yes, 
   we can all zoom way out and squint at our screens, not everyone has
the luxury of 27&quot; monitors.

So this is the one and only point that I have to disagree with; but if everyone
would rather sticking to /really long lines/ instead, then I'll just
have to suffer
with the wrapping.

On a lighter note, tomorrow I'm going to tackle this one if nobody wants
to discuss it first:

Cheers,
                                                                 -Tristan
