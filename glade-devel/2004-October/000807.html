Good call.

&gt;<i> Tristan Van Berkom - working on getting glade-3 to play with custom gtk

</I>
     I'm ploughing through the core as well ATM, got aquiainted pretty much with
the entire code base, I had a chat with Paolo (was it yesterday ?) and
that helped
alot... If its desired I could post a sort of road map as to what I
understand about
the sources etc.

&gt;<i> The few questions I'll raise also:
</I>[...]
&gt;<i>       * There isn't much in bugzilla, nor the TODO file (well, there's
</I>&gt;<i>         actually a decent amount there, but...); do people have their
</I>&gt;<i>         own lists of things? I've got a few things that I should be
</I>&gt;<i>         filing in bugzilla over the next few days, and I'd encourage
</I>&gt;<i>         others to do the same
</I>
I'd like to depricate the TODO list and migrate to bugzilla as well, but
for the record, Paolo said that the TODO was up-to-date regardless of
its age; so that answers your next question:

&gt;<i>       * Speaking of bugzilla, should the items in the TODO file get
</I>&gt;<i>         migrated there so there can be discussion/partial
</I>&gt;<i>         patches/progress messages/etc?
</I>I'd say yes.

I'll start posting my known issues to bugzilla as well.

&gt;<i>       * Also speaking of bugzilla, who has permissions to do bug
</I>&gt;<i>         assignments/etc for glade-3?
</I>
Hmmm, is that not anonymous at gnome ?

Cheers,
                                                       -Tristan
