<PRE>Hi!

Thank you for reply... :-)

Not sure about this link (it takes me to HP Customer Care)... but I'm
aware of the bugzilla.gnome.org site...

Certainly, I will start with just that.

Well, I can say that I have 4+ years of experience with C++, 6+ with C,
and have done lots of GUI programming with Java, Tcl/Tk, Qt, and probably
some others which don't come to mind right now. I also know a great number
of other languages which are irrelevant to this project (I guess I could mention
SQL, PHP, Python, shell, awk, sed, whatever...), but I am picking up on GTK+
and also need to get to grips with autoconf, automake, and libtool soon.

Here is what I would interested in:

- getting the source to build properly and reporting bugs if it doesn't, perhaps
  I can even learn about autoconf etc... here
- attempting minor user interface fixes whenever I think I can do it right
  (maybe I could start working on some easy-fix low-priority stuff just to
  get my hands wet with it before I jump right in) ?
- checking out intltool compatibility (since the manual does not know
  whether it is working it seems).
- testing, testing, and testing
- ah, and I'd really like to test the new &quot;Tree and List Widget&quot; implementation.
  I've heared it's somewhat complex, and I would like to be there to make sure
  that it works properly and make suggestions etc... I need to learn about this
  myself since I plan to use zillions of these in a project of my own, so, I can
  check it out and see what I can do with it.

I don't know whether this sounds reasonable. I also don't know what patch
and CVS policies you have.

&gt;<i> Glad to see another person interested in helping out.
</I>
Thanks, as I said I want to try my best, and get started on this ASAP.
I think there is quite a lot that I could learn from this experience and I
am looking forward to it!!!! :-)

Neil
