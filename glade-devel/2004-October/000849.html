As you can see by skimming through the archives from the past few weeks,
things are starting to pick up, and a new batch of people are working on
getting our sea legs.

At this point, I'll point you at the current glade3 bugs
( <A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/67msj">http://tinyurl.com/67msj</A> ); skim through that and see if anything
leaps out at you.

Another very useful thing would be to just build &amp; use glade 3; banging
on it to see what's shakey/broken and filing bugs against those things
would be a great help; I have a sneaking suspicion, with some heavy use,
a bunch of things that aren't currently in bugzilla will show up.

If you could pass along some information about your programming
background, platform experiences/availabilities/preferences, particular
areas of interest/skill, etc. it would be useful to try and figure out
specific things to try and point you toward.

Glad to see another person interested in helping out.
