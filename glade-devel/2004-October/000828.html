<PRE>Hello all,
   I've sent this patch to bugzilla and it pretty much describes the state of
my current source tree.

    I fixed the segfault that happens every time a widget is destroyed and
its class is accessed (thankyou valgrind ;-D); this patch includes the fixed
implementation, the deprication of flags on the GladeWidgetClass struct
and the fix for G_PARAM_CONSTRUCT_ONLY, the draw_nodes_idle
code in glade-utils is alot safer too.

link:  <A HREF="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=154727">http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=154727</A>

Now I've been getting these errors when the selection changes:
====================================
(glade-3:23444): Gtk-WARNING **: A floating object was finalized. This
means that someone
called g_object_unref() on an object that had only a floating
reference; the initial floating reference is not owned by anyone
and must be removed with gtk_object_sink() after a normal
reference is obtained with g_object_ref().
====================================

    And they are not part of my patch (I have a clean cvs version that I use to
check for regression), I believe I only started seeing theese errors since the 
checkin storm last week (there were a bunch of checkins just after the list 
came back up); 
    Is it possible that anyone could check if there checkins introduced this
behaviour and why (I wasn't able to nail it just yet, so I could use a hand) ?

Cheers,
                                                                   -Tristan
