<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; At this point, I'll point you at the current glade3 bugs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ( <A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/67msj">http://tinyurl.com/67msj</A> ); skim through that and see if anything
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; leaps out at you.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure about this link (it takes me to HP Customer Care)... but I'm
</I>&gt;<i> aware of the bugzilla.gnome.org site...
</I>
Odd; for me it blows up into (the extremely ugly)
<A HREF="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&short_desc=&product=glade3&long_desc_type=allwordssubstr&long_desc=&status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr&status_whiteboard=&keywords_type=anywords&keywords=&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&emailtype1=substring&email1=&emailtype2=substring&email2=&bugidtype=include&bug_id=&changedin=&chfieldfrom=&chfieldto=Now&chfieldvalue=&namedcmd=GnomeICU+Bugs&newqueryname=&field0-0-0=noop&type0-0-0=noop&value0-0-0=&order=bugs.bug_severity,bugs.bug_id">http://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&amp;short_desc=&amp;product=glade3&amp;long_desc_type=allwordssubstr&amp;long_desc=&amp;status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr&amp;status_whiteboard=&amp;keywords_type=anywords&amp;keywords=&amp;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=NEW&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;emailtype1=substring&amp;email1=&amp;emailtype2=substring&amp;email2=&amp;bugidtype=include&amp;bug_id=&amp;changedin=&amp;chfieldfrom=&amp;chfieldto=Now&amp;chfieldvalue=&amp;namedcmd=GnomeICU+Bugs&amp;newqueryname=&amp;field0-0-0=noop&amp;type0-0-0=noop&amp;value0-0-0=&amp;order=bugs.bug_severity,bugs.bug_id</A>

&gt;<i> Certainly, I will start with just that.
</I>Great, thanks

&gt;<i> - getting the source to build properly and reporting bugs if it doesn't
</I>I'll probably be checking in some changes in a little today to help
clean up some of the compile warnings, so hopefully soon things will be
clean enough that it's just a matter of beating people up if they
introduce any new warnings

&gt;<i>  perhaps I can even learn about autoconf etc...
</I>That'd be handy; I've got a passable understanding of the stuff, but if
someone could really get a good grasp of it, it'd probably be handy.

There's also the question of how that stuff all works on win32; I saw
you're doing some building there. I personally have no experience with
gtk et al. on win32, so if we could build up some knowledge with that,
it'd be good

&gt;<i> - attempting minor user interface fixes whenever I think I can do it right
</I>&gt;<i>   (maybe I could start working on some easy-fix low-priority stuff just to
</I>&gt;<i>   get my hands wet with it before I jump right in) ?
</I>Yeah, as soon as you file those bugs :P

As I said, the stuff in bugzilla is a little anemic right now (and
what's in there already probably needs some triaging, since lots of it
is fairly old...although probably still valid)

&gt;<i> - checking out intltool compatibility (since the manual does not know
</I>&gt;<i>   whether it is working it seems).
</I>Well, I saw your stuff about that; have you tried with the latest
intltool from cvs? It looks like the last real release was ~2 weeks
before the code for the comment handling and whatnot went in. It could
just all be in flux until the next real release of that

&gt;<i> - testing, testing, and testing
</I>yes, please

&gt;<i> - ah, and I'd really like to test the new &quot;Tree and List Widget&quot; implementation.
</I>&gt;<i>   I've heared it's somewhat complex, and I would like to be there to make sure
</I>&gt;<i>   that it works properly and make suggestions etc... I need to learn about this
</I>&gt;<i>   myself since I plan to use zillions of these in a project of my own, so, I can
</I>&gt;<i>   check it out and see what I can do with it.
</I>yeah, I've never particularly liked dealing with them, but some of
that's because I don't entire grok them. Getting a good way to edit
columns and the like in glade would be really handy, but it's probably a
fairly big headache, will require a bunch of new stuff in libglade, etc.

There's a bug (131382) open for the issue right now, but I don't think
anybody has yet put any serious time &amp; effort into figuring out what
will be required.

&gt;<i> I don't know whether this sounds reasonable. I also don't know what patch
</I>&gt;<i> and CVS policies you have.
</I>Yeah, it all seems reasonable. And policies are sort of up in the air
right now; things are in flux with us new guys, and who knows what will
happen when/if Joaquin comes back &amp; sees what's gone on.
