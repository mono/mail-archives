I'm still maintaining glade-2 - I'm about to do another release.
I may help with glade-3 a bit, but probably not much.

I think Joaquin Cuenca Abela is the official maintainer.

For now I think you guys should add patches to bugs in bugzilla.
After a while you'll be given permission to commit straight to cvs, and
a cvs account if you don't have one.


&gt;<i>       * Who does <A HREF="mailto:glade3-maint@bugzilla.gnome.org">glade3-maint@bugzilla.gnome.org</A> (the default assignee
</I>&gt;<i>         on glade3 bugs) go to? (I suppose it's potentially this list &amp; I

It goes to whoever wants it. You set your bugzilla preferences to
'watch' the account:
  <A HREF="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/bugsquad/maintainers.html">http://developer.gnome.org/projects/bugsquad/maintainers.html</A>


&gt;<i>       * There isn't much in bugzilla, nor the TODO file (well, there's
</I>&gt;<i>         actually a decent amount there, but...); do people have their
</I>&gt;<i>         own lists of things? I've got a few things that I should be
</I>&gt;<i>         filing in bugzilla over the next few days, and I'd encourage
</I>&gt;<i>         others to do the same
</I>
I think there is actually still a lot of work to get glade-3 ready.

Here's a quick list:

  o Add support for a few more types of properties - pixbufs, stock
    items and stock icons (preferably with the ability to add custom
    ones). Possibly also radio groups, and mnemonic target widgets
    ('Focus Target' in glade-2). Any others?
  o Update support for string/text properties to include extra
    attributes to help translation - &quot;translatable&quot; and &quot;context&quot;
    flags and &quot;comments&quot; string. (I've just added this to glade-2).
  o Menu editor.
  o Accessibility.
  o Going through all widgets checking which properties are needed,
    creating the xml file, and then testing. And adding any special
    code that is needed (this could be a lot of work. I'm not sure).


&gt;<i>       * Speaking of bugzilla, should the items in the TODO file get
</I>&gt;<i>         migrated there so there can be discussion/partial
</I>&gt;<i>         patches/progress messages/etc?
</I>
Yes, major features/problems could go in bugzilla.


&gt;<i>       * Who has access to/maintains the web pages at glade.gnome.org?
</I>
It is in cvs, in the glade-web module. I maintain it at present.

&gt;<i>       * Who is the list admin for glade-users and glade-devel? (Possibly
</I>&gt;<i>         Damon, since he had responded to Dan Winship about nuking glade-
</I>&gt;<i>         announce)
</I>
Yes, it is me.

Damon
