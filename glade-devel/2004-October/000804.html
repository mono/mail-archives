</I>I'm game.

So to introduce _MYSELF_, I'm also interested in trying to help breath
some life into glade-3, get it back on track, etc.

I do have a gnome cvs account, so if ownership can get sorted out, I'm
able to commit things assuming I can get permission from whoever would
be appropriate.

Right now (well, a while ago, and only just now did I finally file the
bug/patch), I'm going through the codebase and documenting it (gtk-doc
style comments, though there's no infrastructure there to actually
generate the docs; I plan to look into that eventually, assuming nobody
beats me to the punch), and seeing about some rough cleanup (bug 153581:
there's a bunch of code inside #ifdef 0, which makes it hard to skim the
code &amp; get familiar with what's going on)
