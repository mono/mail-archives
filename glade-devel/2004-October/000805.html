<PRE>Now that the list is back up, how about a quick role call to see who's
out there, spending time working on this, etc?

I hadn't known about Tristan until his message, nor he until mine. It's
probably a decent idea to get everyone to stand up &amp; point themselves
out so we can get some clue how many people are interested in working on
things, figure out who (if anyone) is maintainer, etc.

Just to list the few potential players I'm aware of at this point and
what little info I know, and to get the ball rolling:

David Hoover - myself, interested in hacking on glade-3 in general, have
               gnome cvs account, volunteering to be maintainer if 
               needed

Tristan Van Berkom - working on getting glade-3 to play with custom gtk 
                     widgets, no gnome cvs account yet, volunteering to 
                     be maintainer if needed

Morton Welinder - applied a patch of mine the other day &amp; plugged a
                  bunch of memory leaks the other day as well. Has a 
                  gnome cvs account.

Shane Butler - has done some patches to glade-3 on occasion when not 
               busy with other things.

Paolo Borelli - had been doing glade-3 work in the past, unsure of 
                current status

Damon Chaplin - had been doing glade-3 work in the past, unsure of
                current status

Joaquin Cuenca Abela - had been doing glade-3 work in the past, unsure
                       of current status




The few questions I'll raise also:
      * Is there a current maintainer? If so, who? If not, who can make
        the call to assign a new one?
      * Who does <A HREF="mailto:glade3-maint@bugzilla.gnome.org">glade3-maint@bugzilla.gnome.org</A> (the default assignee
        on glade3 bugs) go to? (I suppose it's potentially this list &amp; I
        just haven't seen that since the list had been broken, but I
        don't know)
      * There isn't much in bugzilla, nor the TODO file (well, there's
        actually a decent amount there, but...); do people have their
        own lists of things? I've got a few things that I should be
        filing in bugzilla over the next few days, and I'd encourage
        others to do the same
      * Speaking of bugzilla, should the items in the TODO file get
        migrated there so there can be discussion/partial
        patches/progress messages/etc?
      * Also speaking of bugzilla, who has permissions to do bug
        assignments/etc for glade-3?
      * Who has access to/maintains the web pages at glade.gnome.org?
      * Who is the list admin for glade-users and glade-devel? (Possibly
        Damon, since he had responded to Dan Winship about nuking glade-
        announce)

Those are, I think, the biggies that come to mind right now which I
would like to see sorted out, but I'm quite possibly missing other
important details, so please feel free to add new questions/answers/etc.
