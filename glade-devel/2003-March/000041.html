<PRE>Hi, I don't know if anybody here can help me but I cannot find any mailing-list
about libglade and libglade-convert on the net.

I used glade at work, we started a big management project with glade1, now my
boss want to transfert the project to gtk2, then I try the libglade-convert script.

But I had a problem. The position, lenght and the width of the widgets were not
keeped. I found that it was because the function used in glade were depracated
in gtk2. But it seem that in this condition they were not transfered, with
libglade-convert in their format in glade2.

Can anybody help? what can I do? I have too many widget in my program to resize
all of them and to place all of them at the right place...
