How do you solve the second problem with glademm?

You generate a file, say foo.cpp, with glademm.  I edit it, change the
glade file, and regenerate the file.  Do you conserve the changes done
to foo.cpp by hand?

Honestly, I don't think that the exact language in which the code is
generated has any impact.

&gt;<i> (Except for the fourth point, you need some glademm knowledge to solve 
</I>&gt;<i> glademm problems/bugs, gtkmm only knowledge might help you but is not 
</I>&gt;<i> always sufficient).

</I>
exactly like with C.  Please understand that I'm not bashing C++ (as
it's also usually my language of choice), but I don't see any
substantial difference, here.

&gt;<i> &gt; Libglade is a development methology we can support, because it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gets used extensively for real apps. There may be full scale
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; apps using generated glade code, but certainly not many of them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can name a lot of apps using glademm generated code. There _are_ 
</I>&gt;<i> reasons for generated code:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - a single binary is enough, no need to ship .glade and image files 
</I>&gt;<i> seperately, install them to a known location and find them at runtime.
</I>&gt;<i> - no user can mess up your program's user interface by editing/deleting 
</I>&gt;<i> the .glade/image files (this is clearly a pro and a con!)
</I>
I agree that there may be reasons to use generated code (mostly of the
kind of &quot;we don't want a dependency on libxml-2&quot;), but I don't agree
with your reasons.

It's quite rare to find a program that can be installed with just an
executable.  In fact except for trivial programs (and mono executables
when you put everything in the same .exe), you always have a lot of
things to install.  Some .glade files don't make really a difference.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;Makes sense to me; we had
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Don't use glade to generate code, use libglade!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> for C I can't disagree, but I would love to have the option to switch 
</I>&gt;<i> between libglade and generated code (statically linked in widgets) 
</I>&gt;<i> without having to change a single line of the program. Since this is 
</I>&gt;<i> feasible with C++, it should be possible for C, too. Perhaps a nice 
</I>&gt;<i> project for a volunteer? (I don't care about C code)
</I>
That feasible in any language.  But that's not the problem.  The problem
is:  How do you deal with changes done by hand in the generated code?

MS deals with this problem adding &quot;please, don't change this code&quot;
comments (and of course, hell opens when you don't follow the advice). 
I guess that I don't have to discuss the problems of that approach...
but in fact, you can't do much better if you generate code.

&gt;<i> A separation of GUI designer and code generator would benefit 
</I>&gt;<i> glade-[123] IMHO. (IIRC glade-3 does take this road)
</I>
glade-3 ignores completely the code generator stage.

Cheers,
