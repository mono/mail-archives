Please find it attached.

Here's what actually changed:

- Many occurrences of &quot;class&quot; renamed to &quot;klass&quot;, especially the member
&quot;class&quot; of the struct _GladeProperty, which, in turn, led to many
renamings whenever an instance of that type was used.

- Many functions had an argument named &quot;new&quot;. changed that to e.g.
&quot;new_widget&quot; or &quot;new_object&quot;, depending on its type. if there also was
an argument named &quot;old&quot;,it was renamed accordingly (so that the
function e.g. reads
(GtkWidget *old_widget, GtkWidget *new_widget)
 instead of
(GtkWidget *old, GtkWidget *new_widget)

- Renamed member &quot;virtual&quot; of struct _GladePropertyClass
(glade-property-class.h) to &quot;virt&quot; and also renamed it wherever an
instance of type GladePropertyClass was used.

When one of the above keywords appeared in a comment, it was only
renamed if it explicitely referred to a variable or an argument, e.g. in
doxygen comments.

This patch applies cleanly to the current cvs HEAD. Glade compiles and
runs without me noticing anything strange.

Hope you like it :-)
