I did some more investigating of the delay problem. If the glade file has a 
GtkFileChooseButton, when glade loads the file it asks me for my ssh key 
password if I haven't added it to my agent with ssh-add. Then it delays, 
regardless of whether it was in my agent, wasn't and I entered it, or wasn't 
and I cancelled the dialog. I cleaned out all sftp entries from 
~/.recently-used and that didn't help. I also tried creating a key pair on my 
second account (where it works) and sftping from the gnome run dialog (using 
password only) and it kept working. Any ideas as to what the problem could be 
or what to try next?
