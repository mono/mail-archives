Yes we planned on that feature, but it had to be reimplemented - we knew
this from the start - thats why I'm saying temporary, it was temporarily
included at the time &quot;as is&quot; - but &quot;as is&quot; was altogether unacceptable
because it changes properties without notifying the user (not to
mention that the actual window resizing was driven by the properties 
themselves - however that is fixed now).

Consider that if the user wants to save a toplevel without specifying
a default-width/height (i.e. &quot;the normal use case&quot;) - the user has to be
especially carefull to never resize the window in the workspace - or to
always remember to disable those properties before saving - sorry but
thats not an option.

&gt;<i> &gt; The behaviour I was looking for was:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   - If the user checked/enabled the default-width/height, then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     effect the default-width/height
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   - Else if the user checked/enabled the width/height-request, then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     effect the width/height-request
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   - Else do nothing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am uncomfortable with this for many reasons. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Firstly, why would users ever want to set the width/height request on
</I>&gt;<i> GtkWindow's anyway? This is bad usage, and the GTK+ docs clearly state
</I>&gt;<i> as much [2]. If the user is misinformed or has some specialised needs,
</I>&gt;<i> then she is quite free to change the width/height request in the
</I>&gt;<i> property editor.
</I>
If the user went and explicitly checked the box enableing the
width/height-request properties - we must assume the user knows
what they are doing - also consider that ultimately toplevels in
the workspace are not nescisarily GtkWindows (thats just a current
shortcomming)

&gt;<i> Secondly, it is modal behaviour (i.e if X then &quot;user must do Y&quot; else
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;user must do Z&quot;). This makes it hard for the user to carry out tasks,
</I>&gt;<i> as the process of performing modal tasks is generally more confusing and
</I>&gt;<i> complicated for the user (rather like the modal behaviour of Vi).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thirdly, this behaviour implies that users must understand what these
</I>&gt;<i> mysterious GTK+ API properties actually mean, and why setting a default
</I>&gt;<i> size is recommended over setting a size request.
</I>
It is not recommended to set a default size or a size request, if the
user knows what they are doing, they might use these properties.

Cheers,
                   -Tristan
