There was nothing wrong with the resizing being driven by
glade_widget_set_property(), it killed two birds with one stone. The
call allowed me to update the property editor and set the default size
at the same time. Just because the implementation looked overly simple
does not mean the implementation was necessarily wrong ;)

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>OK, well that's a good point, and Murray seems to concur. Looks like I
will concur as well.

&gt;<i> If the user went and explicitly checked the box enableing the

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I still think it does not make sense for the user to set the
width/height request by resizing the window/widget. The resizing feature
is good, it allows you to test packing options, and to adjust the
default size. But making it do more, especially with the modal algorithm
you described, just makes things more complex from code and usability
perspectives.

cheers,

Vincent
