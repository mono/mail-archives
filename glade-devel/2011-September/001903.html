<PRE>Hi  Denis,

Thanks you very much for this amazing work.

I was wondering if the current code allows the binding of a 'model'
instance property to a widget's one. By model I mean non-graphical
non-glade-handled GObject. Is there some way to expose some arbitrary
GObject in the GtkBuilder context so we can bind its properties ?

Regarding transformation, would'nt providing default transformations
(int &lt;-&gt; string, percentage &lt;-&gt; double in 0...1, etc.. ) make you life
easier by not supporting user provided functs while covering 90%
percent of use cases ?

Happy Coding,
Alexandre

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://live.gnome.org/DenisWashington_GtkBuilder">https://live.gnome.org/DenisWashington_GtkBuilder</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While talking on IRC with Tristan yesterday, I realized that while I
</I>&gt;<i> sent out weekly reports to gnome-soc-list and blogged about my work
</I>&gt;<i> twice, I never actually wrote anything about the code's status or
</I>&gt;<i> technical details on this mailing list. I would like to apologize for my
</I>&gt;<i> failure to do so and will try to make up for it by telling you
</I>&gt;<i> *everything* in this message: what I have done, how I have done it, what
</I>&gt;<i> works now, where the remaining problems are, and how these issues could
</I>&gt;<i> be overcome (this is where I really need your feedback!).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For those who don't know, the objective of my work is to extend Glade
</I>&gt;<i> with support for creating bindings between widget properties in a
</I>&gt;<i> project. What this means is that you can define a property's value as
</I>&gt;<i> being directly dependent on the value of another property - whenever the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;source&quot; property's value is set, the value of the &quot;target&quot; property is
</I>&gt;<i> automatically updated, either to the same value or a user-defined
</I>&gt;<i> transformation thereof (more on this later). GLib supports this through
</I>&gt;<i> its GBinding API [1]. The goal is to expose this functionality in Glade
</I>&gt;<i> so that the user can create, modify and delete property bindings in
</I>&gt;<i> Glade and save them as part of a UI file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This feature requires changes to both GTK+ and Glade, so I created
</I>&gt;<i> git.gnome.org branches for both of them, named &quot;gtkbuilder-gbinding&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;gbinding&quot;, respectively [2][3]. The GTK+ branch adds support for a new
</I>&gt;<i> bit of GtkBuilder syntax - the &lt;binding&gt; element - which makes it
</I>&gt;<i> possible for GtkBuilder objects to read property bindings from UI files.
</I>&gt;<i> It is used like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &lt;object name=&quot;button&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; ...
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &lt;binding to=&quot;sensitive&quot; from=&quot;active&quot; source=&quot;checkbutton&quot;/&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &lt;/object&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> which means: &quot;Let the 'sensitive' property of 'button' always have the
</I>&gt;<i> same value as the 'active' property of 'checkbutton'.&quot; Thanks to the
</I>&gt;<i> existence of GBinding, the code changes required for this are pretty
</I>&gt;<i> small. No new API is introduced; all bindings are automatically created
</I>&gt;<i> at the time they are read in by gtk_builder_add_from*(). (But this might
</I>&gt;<i> change slightly; see the problem discussion later in this epic mail
</I>&gt;<i> message).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;gbinding&quot; Glade branch is where the bulk of my work happened. It
</I>&gt;<i> adds a new &quot;binding-source&quot; property to GladeProperty for representing
</I>&gt;<i> property bindings in the data model and supports serialization and
</I>&gt;<i> deserialization of this information to &lt;binding&gt; elements. (See
</I>&gt;<i> glade_property_binding_read() and glade_property_binding_write() in
</I>&gt;<i> glade-property.c, respectively.) Furthermore, it augments Glade's
</I>&gt;<i> undo/redo framework with a glade_command_bind_property() command for
</I>&gt;<i> creating and deleting property bindings. On the UI side, this command is
</I>&gt;<i> exposed through a &quot;Bind to source...&quot; context menu item in the property
</I>&gt;<i> inspector. (For screenshots of how the UI currently looks, see my blog
</I>&gt;<i> posts [4][5].)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The UI and data model has been adapted to reflect the defined property
</I>&gt;<i> bindings:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - glade_command_set_property() was modified to recursively set the value
</I>&gt;<i> of all properties bound to the originally set property. This means that
</I>&gt;<i> the effect of a property binding is immediately visible in the Glade
</I>&gt;<i> workspace.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - In the property inspector, the edit widgets for bound properties are
</I>&gt;<i> insensitive (setting the value of a bound property doesn't make much
</I>&gt;<i> sense). Also, the tooltip of a bound property shows which other property
</I>&gt;<i> it is bound to.
</I>&gt;<i> (See glade-editor-property.c)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I made some precautions to avoid invalid property bindings:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - The &quot;Bind to source...&quot; dialog for choosing the source of a property
</I>&gt;<i> binding only allows you to select properties that have the same, or a
</I>&gt;<i> compatible, type, and are enabled (if they are optional) and sensitive
</I>&gt;<i> (if there are one of multiple alternative properties, e.g. &quot;text&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;stock&quot; and &quot;embedded widget&quot; in GtkButton). All other properties are
</I>&gt;<i> greyed out and moved to the end of the list.
</I>&gt;<i> (See glade_editor_property_show_bind_dialog() and its helper functions
</I>&gt;<i> in glade-editor-property.c)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - If the source or target of a property binding disappears because the
</I>&gt;<i> widget it belongs to is deleted, the binding is automatically removed
</I>&gt;<i> too. This is properly integrated into the undo/redo system, so undoing
</I>&gt;<i> the widget removal also brings the property binding back.
</I>&gt;<i> (See glade_command_delete_binding_refs() in glade-command.c)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One remaining issue with the current code is that it does not react to
</I>&gt;<i> property binding sources becoming disabled or insensitive. This is
</I>&gt;<i> currently not possible in a sane way as changes to a property's
</I>&gt;<i> enabled/sensitivity state are not tracked with the undo/redo framework
</I>&gt;<i> at the moment. (I had code to do this in the branch before, but it
</I>&gt;<i> worked with manual signal handling hackery and was removed later on
</I>&gt;<i> Tristan's request.) The obvious solution would be to change this by
</I>&gt;<i> introducing glade_command_set_property_enabled() and
</I>&gt;<i> glade_command_set_property_sensitive() and porting all of Glade to that.
</I>&gt;<i> If there is general agreement to do so, I would be willing to do that
</I>&gt;<i> work. In any case, this has to be fixed in some way before the branch is
</I>&gt;<i> ready to be merged into master.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Other than that, I don't know of any other major showstoppers, but an
</I>&gt;<i> extensive code review by Juan and Tristan might very well reveal some. ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The big question, however, it how to support transformation functions
</I>&gt;<i> for property bindings. This GBinding feature allows you to define a
</I>&gt;<i> function that processes the value of a binding's source property before
</I>&gt;<i> it is applied to the target, which allows you to create bindings between
</I>&gt;<i> properties of different types and generally make property bindings much
</I>&gt;<i> more useful and interesting. Adding this into the GTK+ and Glade
</I>&gt;<i> branches is not a big problem in principle, and in fact I did just that
</I>&gt;<i> during Summer of Code. However, I had to later remove the code again,
</I>&gt;<i> the reason being on the GTK+/GLib side.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is when and how to resolve the transformation function names
</I>&gt;<i> that would be stored in the GtkBuilder file to the actual function
</I>&gt;<i> implementations. In my code, I moved all property binding creation to
</I>&gt;<i> two new API functions, gtk_builder_create_bindings() and
</I>&gt;<i> gtk_builder_create_bindings_full(), which take the same arguments as
</I>&gt;<i> gtk_builder_connect_signals*() and locate transformation functions the
</I>&gt;<i> same way (GModule or a custom callback, called GtkBuilderBindingFunc).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, this setup means more work for language binding authors:
</I>&gt;<i> because transformation functions are specified as an argument to
</I>&gt;<i> g_object_bind_property_full() rather than by connecting a signal, a
</I>&gt;<i> language-specific GtkBuilderConnectFunc for
</I>&gt;<i> gtk_builder_connect_signals*() cannot be reused and each language
</I>&gt;<i> binding would be required to provide a GtkBuilderBindingFunc to replace
</I>&gt;<i> the use of GModule with something appropriate for the language. Also,
</I>&gt;<i> the introduction of another function to be called for every loaded
</I>&gt;<i> GtkBuilder function is really not ideal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Talking with Juan and Tristan, we concluded that a proper solution
</I>&gt;<i> probably requires changes to GBinding itself. More specifically, if
</I>&gt;<i> GBinding implemented the transformation function as being the handler of
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;transform&quot; signal instead of an anonymous callback, one could reuse
</I>&gt;<i> gtk_builder_connect_signals*() to locate transformation functions and
</I>&gt;<i> move property binding creation there. For backwards compatibility and
</I>&gt;<i> convenience, the g_object_bind_property() API could still stay as it is
</I>&gt;<i> now. There would be some issues to sort out - for instance, how to
</I>&gt;<i> behave if multiple signal handlers are connected to the &quot;transform&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> signal - but it might be doable without breaking anything. This still
</I>&gt;<i> needs to be talked about with both the GLib and GTK+ team, though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For reference, you can still find my code with transformation function
</I>&gt;<i> support in the &quot;gtkbuilder-gbinding&quot; GTK+ and &quot;gbinding-transform&quot; Glade
</I>&gt;<i> branch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, this is all there is to say about the code now. (This mail is
</I>&gt;<i> already way too long as it is. ;) I hope you now have a better insight
</I>&gt;<i> wrt what I have done during GSoC and what is still to do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I wrote in the beginning, I need your feedback! If you have any
</I>&gt;<i> questions, remarks, or suggestions regarding the issues I outlined -
</I>&gt;<i> especially regarding the transformation function situation - I would be
</I>&gt;<i> excited to hear them! Thanks. :)
