GNOME guidelines pretty fairly state that patches should be written
using whatever style the author writes the code in.  For community
projects like Glade, a style should be _decided upon_ (and I believe
Tristan and co. have decided on new lines for braces) and then any
patches should follow this style.  Style is such a trivial issue,
anyway!

Most of us are pretty good programmers, let's not quarrel over stuff
like this.  Write a short sed script that converts your style into Glade
style, if you like, and apply it before submitting patches :-)

I personally prefer braces on the same line for control blocks (if, for,
while) and braces on new lines for function definitions, but hey, that's
me.  If I write a project from scratch ever, that'll be my style.  In
the end, when submitting patches I convert to the style of the author,
which is what everyone should do, probably ;-)
