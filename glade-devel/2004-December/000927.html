Well ok. But we should really make up our mind about this, because
initially glade-3 did have a glade-2/gimp like palette. So switching
back and forth isn't a good idea. Also while we are on the subject,
personally I prefer the newer arrangement list style as compared to the
old MxN matrix. Most other UI Designers use a list stlye. Thats why we
switched in the first place. This thread has a history of the last
discussion on the subject...

&gt;<i> About using the GladeCommand interface inside the generic Query

</I>&gt;<i> yes that is definitly a bug but I think the &quot;from_query_dialog&quot; code

</I>
Well I see the GladeCommand code first as code for doing &quot;actions&quot; and
the undo/redo as a additional feature. Point being I think doing it the
&quot;from_query_dialog&quot; way, is the best way. If we do it like you suggest,
we'll be copying lots of code from GladeEditor and GladeCommand, only to
put it separately as a GladeQueryDialog. Most of the code is already
written (thats why glade_editor_query_dialog() in its present form uses
the glade_editor_table_create() and friends anyway). We only skip
pushing the action on the undo stack.

&gt;<i> Finally, please send patches to bugzilla; I find it alot easier to
</I>&gt;<i> track that way (nothing gets lost that way and I can always identify
</I>&gt;<i> which is the latest version of your patch).
</I>
Will do.
