Right now we have you and Marco doing some things for the preview
feature... also Matthias has been sending some regular little GTK+ 3.0
breakage patches...

Maybe we should try holding some irc team meeting, boil down the
blockers towards a 3.0 release, the usual drill.

In the past that approach has been successful in attracting some
contributions, if we're at least 3 willing to participate in a meeting
that should set a good atmosphere.

Maybe we can solicit d-d-l or even some gtk+ lists.

Anyway, giving it some thought over the next days...

Cheers,
            -Tristan
