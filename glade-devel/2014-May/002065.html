<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I nevertheless invite you to try this binary on debian wheezy:
</I>&gt;<i>     <A HREF="https://people.gnome.org/~tvb/test-bundles/glade">https://people.gnome.org/~tvb/test-bundles/glade</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If it's 64bit linux then I'm pretty confident the binary will &quot;just run&quot;
</I>it does run (more or less), so thanks for this.
Here's some feedback from using this version (3.16.0) to create a small GUI:

Usability:

- It uses some weird theme, and looks completely different than all
  other GTK+-applications here (btw. I'm not using GNOME but plain fvwm).
  Maybe the message &quot;GLib-GIO-Message: Using the 'memory' GSettings backend.  Your settings will not be saved or shared with other applications.&quot;
  has something to do with this. Can this be changed, so that some
  default theme is used?

- It's again much slower than Glade 3.12.
  Selecting widgets is slower, and editing properties sometimes is
  extremely slow (see bug below).
  Maybe it's the weird theme that makes it generally slower, I don't know
  (and cannot test this, since I cannot find any way to modify the theme).

- The layout of the items in the properties-editor became *much* worse.
  In older versions, most properties used entries or toggle-buttons,
  and were all positioned vertially below each other.
  Now, many properties use switches (which I like) and checkboxes.
  This would be ok, but the layout got very messy: Some properties
  are positioned below each other, others horizonatlly next to each
  other, sometimes in 2 columns, sometimes in 3 columns.
  This makes the layout very messy, confusing and hard to use.
  In addition, this causes the properties-editor to require more
  space on the screen, sometimes nearly half (!) of the screen,
  to show the properties without a horziontal scrollbar (e.g.
  for GtkScrolledWindow).

  So, I would suggest to improve the layout, make it more clear and
  use a clear structure, e.g.: Put all properties vertically below
  each other instead of horizontally next to each other. This would
  improve usability a lot.

  (The Signals-tab requires even more space (mostly because the Detail-
  and Handler-column use much space although they are empty), but this
  is less problematic than with the other tabs.)

- In earlier versions, I could shift-click (or ctrl-click?) an item on
  the palette, an then place this widget multiple times. This was very
  useful if I had to place e.g. many buttons or labels, but it doesn't
  work anymore. Could this be added again?

- In addition to the above: If I click on a wiget on the palette, is
  there any way to abort this without placing the widget? I would
  suggest to make this possible by e.g. pressing ESC or the
  mouse-pointer-button on the toolbar.

Bugs:

- Glade hangs:
  Glade often hangs, when dragging a created GtkPaned/GtkScrolledWindow/etc.
  Glade then only shows a modal window (on all virtual desktops, see
  attachment), doesn't react anymore, and causes 100% CPU load.
  In these cases, I have to kill glade (or more exactly: kill
  /tmp/.mount_Jq1Ok0/home/tristan/Glade/Install/bin/glade).

- Properties editor becomes extremely slow:
  The properties-editor becomes extremely slow after working with it for
  some time: When I want to edit the ID of a widget the contents
  of a label, I sometimes have to type blindly and wait for several
  seconds (e.g. 8s!), or wait for 1 second (with 100% CPU-load!) after
  every chacter until the characters appear in the properties-entry!
  Closing and reopening the Glade-file or restarting Glade usually
  &quot;solves&quot; this for a while.

- Add Parent is broken:
  &quot;Add Parent&quot; does not work anymore e.g. on GtkFrame, GtkAlignment,
  GtkGrid, GtkBox etc. For example, if I create a GtkFrame, add a
  GtkLabel, and then want to add a GtkBox as parent, this doesn't work
  but shows the error &quot;Widgets of type Alignment need placeholders
  to add children.&quot; The same error occurs e.g. when trying to add a
  GtkBox as Parent of a GtkGrid, or a Viewport as Parent to a GtkGrid etc.
  This worked in Glade 3.12.

- Missing &quot;GtkImage&quot; in Palette -&gt; Miscellaneous:
  In the Palette under &quot;Miscellaneous&quot;, &quot;GtkImage&quot; is missing.

- Missing &quot;label&quot;-property in GtkLinkButton Properties:
  There is no way to modify the displayed contents of the linkbutton!
  The only show &quot;button&quot;, and this cannot be changed in Glade.
  Workaround: Edit the GtkBuilder-XML-file directly.

- Wrong widget in GtkButton Properties -&gt; General -&gt; Add custom content:
  I think &quot;[ ] Add custom content&quot; should be a radio-button instead of
  a checkbutton, since it completely behaves like a radiobutton.

- GtkButton Images are not shown in Glade:
  If I create a button including an image, the image is hidden in
  Glade, unless I click &quot;Always show image&quot;. But this property was
  introduced in GTK+3.6, and I'm creating a GUI for GTK+3.2, so
  I cannot use this property.
  Later, in the application (with GTK+ 3.4), the image is shown
  correctly, only Glade doesn't show them.

- &quot;Select Named Icon&quot; in GtkImage Properties does not find any icons:
  Selecting the image by &quot;Icon Name&quot; is broken: The &quot;Select Named
  Icon&quot; does not find any standard-icons. This worked fine in
  Glade 3.12.
  (Maybe the folling message has to do with this:
  &quot;GladeUI-Message: Glade needs artwork; a default icon will be used for the following classes:
   GtkApplicationWindow needs an icon named 'widget-gtk-applicationwindow'&quot;)

- Duplicate widgets in Properties -&gt; Common -&gt; Widget Spacing -&gt; Expand:
  &quot;Horizontal&quot; and &quot;Vertical&quot; here have both a checkbutton and a switch.
  One should be enough, and I would recommend to keep the switch but
  remove the checkbox.

- Preview snapshot sometimes doesn't work:
  When clicking &quot;Preview snapshot&quot;, I sometimes get an empty window
  and the assertion:
  (glade-previewer:8587): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_box_pack: assertion 'gtk_widget_get_parent (child) == NULL' failed

- Assertions:
  I got several assertions. In my understanding, assertions should only
  be used for coding errors, and not for unexpected input.
  Here's a list of some assertions, I got:

  (glade:8214): GladeUI-CRITICAL **: glade_project_selection_clear: assertion 'GLADE_IS_PROJECT (project)' failed
  (glade:13717): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_status_icon_set_from_file: assertion 'filename != NULL' failed
  (glade:13717): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_status_icon_set_from_stock: assertion 'stock_id != NULL' failed
  (glade:13717): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_status_icon_set_from_icon_name: assertion 'icon_name != NULL' failed


Compilation of newer versions:

- It would be nice if there would be some easier way to compile newer
  Glade-versions incl. all dependencies, since it seems that Glade
  is quite buggy, but bugs are only fixed in the newest version,
  which again depends on the newest GTK+-libraries...

Roland
