Hi,
    thanks for the interest Marco and also the comments Vincent.

About libglade and GtkBuilder, GtkBuilder is definitly more of a priority
but I'm not sure its healthy for us to work around it and make conversions
on a preview feature.

To make things a little more clear, while libglade is indeed being
depricated
in favour of new technology, libglade support in the Glade tool is still a
requirement for years to come since libglade will take a while to phase
out completely. So our goal is to load and save in both formats, in which
case
we should have a preview for projects that are libglade based and for
projects that are
GtkBuilder based.

Now, having libglade as a dependency for the tool is not such a bad thing,
although linking it into the executable has caused conflicts in the past,
also I
think it may be unwise to run a preview in the exec space of
glade/libgladeui,
as specially since it could be running from anjuta or another embedding app
(consider that libglade/gtkbuilder will be dlsym looking for callbacks
specified
in glade files, which shouldnt but may conflict with symbols in
glade/anjuta/other).
running previews in a separate execution space also eases the possibiliy of
adding themes/gtkrc files to the preview without effecting glade.

So, to recap the two big problems with this approach to preview feature are:
   - Should be running preview from its own main(), an executable that will
     alone be linking against libglade.
   - Needs to be implemented in libgladeui and not solely in glade-window.c
    (I think this should be a feature of glade-project.c, and used from the
frontend)
    otherwise the feature will not be available in anjuta or other
embedders.

Sorry if thats a bit vague and still needs some discussion

Cheers,
                  -Tristan
