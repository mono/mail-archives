Hi,
  We are using Glade for one our product and are very new to Glade. We wish 
to switch to Glade-3 because of its excellent design. Keep-up the good work.

Style sheet property is an important feature for us. We have been
trying to add few style sheet properties in gtk+.xml, but with out success.

Could anyone of you help us to put these properties in place.

&lt;property id=&quot;bg[GTK_STYLE_SELECTED]&quot;&gt;#44446464acac&lt;/property&gt;
We tried adding the above statement for GtkWidgets class and as well as for,
say GtkWindow or GtkButton.
Still could not find such property being displayed in &quot;General&quot; or &quot;common&quot;
tabs of property editor.

Could anyone you answer the following questions.
1. Can style sheet properties be added through gtk+.xml for glade-3 or it is
only through gtkrc files.
2. What is the format of the style sheet entries ( fg, bg, pixmap) if it has
to be in gtk+.xml ? Why did not the above mentioned statment work?
3. We could not find &quot;style propagate&quot;, &quot;style name&quot;, &quot;font name&quot; associated
with any gtk classes. Have these been removed? If not, again what would be
the entries in gtk+.xml for these?
4. Is it planned to put the style properties in a new tab of property editor
or under &quot;common&quot; tab.
5. What other steps have to followed for adding style properties.
6. Is there a document which list down the steps to be followed for adding a
feature/bug fix for glade-3?

TIA,
Divakar E
