Cute ;)

Ah yes, thats because it looks for the toplevel flag and itterates
down from there, this is easy to change (anyway we need support for
top-level non-gtkwidget objects like GtkAdjustment, GtkSizeGroup etc)

&gt;<i> So, the overall solution is a bit hacky. It would be better if glade-3

</I>&gt;<i> using a real Gtk.Window as root widget it could use a special container
</I>&gt;<i> with the same Gtk.Window properties. This special container could be
</I>&gt;<i> then safely embedded in a top level window (like in the current GUI
</I>&gt;<i> model) or in any other kind of container.
</I>
It seems like just special-casing GtkWindow a little will get us there
without having to use a different type of container to &quot;mock&quot; the
GtkWindow... also maybe a &quot;containing&quot; plug widget...

Now I'm wondering if we can offer some kind of sane API for IDE's here
to make it easy to implement; It seems that we need to optionally embed
toplevel in other widgets that will respond well to resizes,

for example: say you wanted to display a notebook where each tab
was an open project in glade; in each tab you display a GtkHBox
inside a scrolled window which lists the toplevels from top down;
the issue I see is that those GtkWindows that are &quot;non-toplevels&quot;
will want to resize to fill up the space in the GtkHBox

So we'd need to have a &quot;top-level&quot; container that would resize while
adding extra &quot;gray space&quot; outside the window (and draw a cute border);
and keep the GtkWindow's &quot;default size&quot; (or current natural size) as its
&quot;size-request&quot; (therefore refusing to shrink).

What do you think ?

Cheers,
