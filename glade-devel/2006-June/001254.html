Ok,
    firstly my apologies for not replying sooner (as I have my mind
on alot of things simultainiously these days).

Currently we are maintaining the gnomeui widget catalog in glade3 cvs.
Daniel has expressed an interest to write the gnome-db catalog, so I
would welcome that... and provide any help that he might need along the
way (Daniel: you can feel free to email me any questions or join me
in #glade3 at irc.gnome.org)

Lets make a stable 3.0 release of glade3 including the gnomeui and
gnomedb catalogs, and then try to move them into gnomeui &amp; gnomedb
respectively afterwards (not sure what that will spell in terms of rpm and
debian packages... but I think they can handle it).

Cheers,
                        -Tristan
