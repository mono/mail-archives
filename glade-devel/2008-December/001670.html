<PRE>Welcome to new Glade !

   I finally decided to release a taste of what I've been doing in
hiding all year,
its basically pretty much feature complete, minus GtkUIManager and GtkActions
(actions Im waiting on the gtk+ team to know how to proceed with them).

The most important things to say about this release is that with it, you can
take your libglade formated glade file, load it, convert it into
GtkBuilder format,
and use it, with the following exception: Gtk+ will not support native menu
hierarchies until 2.16 - which means that for a final stretch, were
still up in the
air with the menus.

THIS IS NOT STABLE SOFTWARE, that being said, I dont think there are
crashers, if there are, there wont be many, but please help me to find them so
we can make a stable release soon :)

We are also attempting something a little new, we are depending on gtk+ 2.14
and trying to let you target gtk+ 2.16 - bug reports around that area
specifically
would be great to track at this point.

What is Glade ?
===============
Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick &amp; easy development of user interfaces
for the Gtk+ toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment.
The user interfaces designed in Glade are stored in XML format,
enabling easy integration with external tools.
In particular libglade and GTK+'s new GtkBuilder can load the XML files and
create the interfaces at runtime. The DTD for the XML files is available at
<A HREF="http://glade.gnome.org/glade-2.0.dtd.">http://glade.gnome.org/glade-2.0.dtd.</A>
