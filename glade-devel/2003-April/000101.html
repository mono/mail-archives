</I>&gt;<i> However I have some questions I would like to know the answer of.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. In the .gladep files it says:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;!DOCTYPE glade-project SYSTEM
</I>&gt;<i>    &quot;<A HREF="http://glade.gnome.org/glade-project-2.0.dtd"">http://glade.gnome.org/glade-project-2.0.dtd&quot;</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    This file is: 404: Not Found.
</I>
There is no DTD for the project file at present. The above is just used
as a unique identifier.

 
&gt;<i> 2. Is the XML files stable or are they moving target at the moment. I
</I>&gt;<i>    see some talk about a glade-3 here. Does this involve changing the
</I>&gt;<i>    XML file again? If the xml files are not stable perhaps it is better
</I>&gt;<i>    to use the Set_Properties procedure and not do any optimised code
</I>&gt;<i>    generation.
</I>
The .glade XML files should be fairly stable now. libglade is part of
GNOME so we need to keep it stable. 

The .gladep files are only for glade-2. glade-3 probably won't need
them.

 
&gt;<i> 3. Why is &lt;language&gt;, &lt;source_directory&gt; etc... missing in the .gladep
</I>&gt;<i>    file if one do not choose something that differs from C, src, etc...?
</I>&gt;<i>    I find this very akward as this means all applications that should be
</I>&gt;<i>    able to read glade XML files need to bake in these default values
</I>&gt;<i>    rather than that this tiny file contributes with all the necessary
</I>&gt;<i>    information.
</I>
I used default values in the original Glade to cut down on the amount of
unnecessary stuff in the XML file. glade-2 does practically the same
thing, except it uses a separate file.

It's too late to change it for glade-2 now.


&gt;<i>    Does the .glade file also have missing tags?
</I>
Yes, it omits some of the common properties if they have default values.
This shouldn't matter, since if they are default values you shouldn't
need to do anything.
