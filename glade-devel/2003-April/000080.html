Speaking of which ... (I think this might be related...)

I have noticed that there is no undo/redo functionality for when widget
names are changed.  The reason is because it is not a glade property.   
glade_editor_widget_name_changed() is different to
glade_editor_property_changed_*() which all use
glade_command_set_property() for undo/redo.
Sure this might be a small thing functionality wise, but it is still a
bug.

PS this could not be entered in as a bug because
<A HREF="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi">http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi</A>
does not list glade3

Yes :-)

I've done some work that was need by the Anjuta's guys, and started
porting the glade-2 menu editor to glade-3 (the last big piece that
glade-3 was lacking).

I think that I'm now considered the new glade-3 maintainer (if Carlos
nor Chema object).  Last time I saw Carlos he said me about glade-3: &quot;I
don't have time&quot; :-)

Archit, are you interested in resuming your work on copy &amp; paste?

Cheers,
