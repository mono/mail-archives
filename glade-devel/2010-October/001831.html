</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the previewer side, there are many things that can be experimented

</I>&gt;<i> glade and glade-previewer. The simplest way would be to just use a tag
</I>&gt;<i> like &quot;&lt;update&gt;&quot; and then send the new ui definition with the
</I>&gt;<i> modifications that were made.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Destroying the preview window and creating a new one to reflect the
</I>&gt;<i> changes is ugly and suboptimal. Another idea (richer but not simpler)
</I>&gt;<i> would be to extend the protocol to tell glade-previewer which changes
</I>&gt;<i> were made. I can see 3 types of changes that could be transformed in
</I>&gt;<i> tags for the protocol: property changes, removal of widget and
</I>&gt;<i> addition of widget.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Changing a property would be easy to propagate to glade-previewer; all
</I>&gt;<i> that is needed is a tag like &lt;change_property object=&quot;object_name&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> property=&quot;property_name&quot; value=&quot;new_value&quot;&gt;. Parsing and committing it
</I>&gt;<i> would not be so simple, but do-able.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Removing a widget is as simple as telling glade-previewer the widget
</I>&gt;<i> to be removed (maybe we'll have tell the widget to be removed and
</I>&gt;<i> which widget is its parent). A tag could be &lt;remove_widget
</I>&gt;<i> parent=&quot;parent_name&quot; widget=&quot;widget_name&quot;&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Adding a new widget would be a bit more complicated, but still
</I>&gt;<i> do-able. The previewer would have to know which widget is the parent
</I>&gt;<i> of the new widget and the ui definition of the new widget. This can be
</I>&gt;<i> achieved by a tag like &lt;add_widget parent=&quot;parent_name&quot;&gt; followed by
</I>&gt;<i> the ui definition of the new widget.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also I'm thinking on other improvements that can improve usefulness of
</I>&gt;<i> a preview, like selecting in glade the widget that has been clicked in
</I>&gt;<i> the preview or adding a new widget to a container in the project if
</I>&gt;<i> the user clicks a widget in the palette and then on a container on a
</I>&gt;<i> preview.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think about it? Comments? Suggestions?
</I>
Kindof contradictory to your original stance which was, &quot;a preview is a
snapshot of the current project state&quot;, the user can spawn as many
previews as they wish.

I'm not sure which approach I prefer, however originally I wanted
&quot;one preview per project&quot; or at least &quot;one preview per toplevel&quot;
which would be updated on project changes or simply have
it's window raised when the user redundantly asks for a new
preview of the same window.

The current implementation however is &quot;sweet and simple&quot;, regardless
of the desktop pollution it potentially creates by allowing the user to
popup tons of preview snapshots.

In the end, it's important for us to decide on a single approach
for the preview before the next major release - probably around
the same time as GTK+ 3.0 release, and best we stick with that
approach for the long term.

I'd like to hear any opinion other readers may have on this.

Cheers,
       -Tristan
