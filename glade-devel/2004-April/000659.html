Hi Damon!

Very good work, indeed!

Unfortunately it works quite badly under windows. It doesn't draw the
selection rectangles over placeholders (?), for instance. It only draws them
over widgets without a window, or the parts of those widgets that are not
covered by an internal window.

It's quite weird, as I've beed breaking in the expose event, and it gets
called.

I've not seen anything bad in the code, but I will keep looking to see
what's going on.

I don't have any objections to commit it (btw, in the future you can commit
when you consider the code is ok).

Cheers,


</PRE>
