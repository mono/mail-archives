Glade [the file format] and XUL are completely different things. XUL is
a presentation language. Glade is an object serialization format for Gtk
widgets that happens to use XML. It is not like HTML (or XUL). It's more
like SVG; it's a somewhat-human-readable description of visual data, but
having a super-compact simplified form of it would not be useful,
because it's much easier to draw b=C3=A9zier curves in a GUI drawing progra=
m
than it is to type out the control points by hand in emacs.

</I>
But there's no reason to hand code a glade file. If you want to code the
UI by hand, you can just write out the Gtk calls in C (or python or
whatever). The point of glade is just to be a graphical way of
generating a description of the layout of a bunch of Gtk widgets. If you
want it to be something other than that, then you're basically talking
about a completely new app/file format.
