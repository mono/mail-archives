Very understandable :-)

&gt;<i> &gt; After the menu editor, yes, I think the next thing will be to check

</I>&gt;<i>    I had lots of problems with this in Glade, since the 
</I>&gt;<i> window you need
</I>&gt;<i>    to draw on isn't necessarily the widget's window (some widgets have
</I>&gt;<i>    more than one window and these may not cover the widget's entire
</I>&gt;<i>    allocated area.) Maybe we should port the glade-2 code over. It is
</I>&gt;<i>    horrible code but we know it works pretty well.
</I>
I took a look a while ago at the glade-2 code.  I think that hooking the
expose event on all the widgets, putting the expose region on the toplevel
widget coordinates, and draw a part of the selection rectangles if need will
we conceptually cleaner than what glade-2 does, but as I'll be also quite
happy with the glade-2 code :-)

&gt;<i>  o Support for pixmap properties, e.g. for the window &quot;icon&quot; property.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  o Support for the event mask property.
</I>
These 3 bugs should be independent of the changes that I have in my hard
drive, so if you can start by these hopefully we will not step on each other
feet

Thank you for your help, Damon.

Cheers,
