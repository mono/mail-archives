I think I may have found the problem. I wasn't using the correct gc in
glade_util_draw_nodes(). I should have used the gc of the widget owning
the window. (I did mean to change that, but forgot.)

I'll commit it with the fix, and you can try it again.

It doesn't work for widgets inside viewports yet either. The coordinate
translation code needs some tweaking. I'll look into that.
