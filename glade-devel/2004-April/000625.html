</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>But in a previous post I had made I asked the question if I could use 
glade_xml_construct to join, at runtime, multiple .glade files into
one GladeXML pointer.  I've noticed that this usage seems to work 
without any problems.  However, because I've was told it is not
correct usage I decided to manually merge all my glade files into
one glade file.  As a result, the one glade file contains multiple
widget id's that are not unique.  So, the script scans through
a single glade file and appends a unique number to each non-unique
widget id.  The reason I need access to all the widget id's through
one GladeXML is because of the system i'm building that allows me
to bind sql to gtk via and xml schema as i described in yet another
post.  In writting the xml that binds sql to xml I think it would of
course be useful to integrate this into glade but of course not as
a utility that is the main focus of glade but as a plugin for people
that would like to bind sql to gtk.
