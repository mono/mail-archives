To try to find my way around the Glade 3 code I've had a quick scan
through all the C files and written a few notes.

I've attached them here in case they are useful to anyone else.

Major Files Implementing The Glade 3 GUI
========================================

glade-project-window.c	- GladeProjectWindow is a struct representing the
			  main window in Glade, with pointers to all the
			  other windows like the widget tree, palette and
			  clipboard.

glade-project-view.c	- GladeProjectView is a GtkScrolledWindow subclass
			  containing a GtkTreeView and a GtkTreeStore.
			  It is used for the main project view and for the
			  widget tree.

glade-project.c		- GladeProject is a GObject representing a project.
			  It contains a name, path, changed flag, list of
			  widgets, list of selected widgets, an undo stack,
			  and a hash of id allocators.

glade-editor.c		- property editor.
			  glade_editor_load_widget() shows the properties of
			  the given GladeWidget in the editor.

glade-signal-editor.c	- GladeSignalEditor is a struct containing information
			  for editing the signals page in the property editor.
			  It shows a tree view of signals.

glade-palette.c		- the palette of widgets (a GtkVBox subclass).
			  glade_palette_append_catalog() adds new widgets.
			  Emits &quot;toggled&quot; when a button is toggled.

glade-menu-editor.c	- a dialog for editing the items in menubars and
			  popup menus.

glade-keys-dialog.c	- a GtkDialog for selecting accelerator keys.
			  Only used by menu editor at present.

glade-clipboard-view.c	- a GtkWindow that contains a GtkTreeView and maintains
			  the GtkListStore model to go with it.
			  glade_clipboard_view_add()/remove() add/remove
			  GladeWidgets from it. (GladeClipboard calls these.)

glade-clipboard.c	- GladeClipboard is a GObject that contains a list of
			  widgets, the currently selected widget, and a pointer
			  to the corresponding clipboard view.
			  glade_clipboard_add()/remove() add/remove
			  GladeWidgets.

glade-popup.c		- handles the popup context menu for a given
			  GladeWidget* or GladePlaceholder*.


Major Files Implementing Representation And Manipulation of Widgets
===================================================================

glade-catalog.c		- struct representing a group of widgets, typically
			  one page in the palette. Each catalog has a title
			  and a list of GladeWidgetClass*.

			  glade_catalog_load() loads one catalog given the
			  base filename, e.g. &quot;gtk-base.xml&quot;. The catalogs
			  are installed in (see configure.in &amp; config.h):
			    $prefix/share/$PACKAGE-$VERSION/catalogs

			  glade_catalog_load_all() loads all the catalogs
			  in glade-palette.xml.

glade-widget-class.c	- GladeWidgetClass is a struct containing information
			  and functions to handle a particular widget class.
			  Has a list of GladePropertyClass for all properties
			  and all child packing properties.
			  Has optional custom functions to handle the widget.

glade-gtk.c		- contains the custom functions needed to handle the
			  GTK+ widgets. There are several types of functions:
			  o Get/Set Properties functions.
			  o Post-Create functions which are called after
			     widgets are created to set them up to be used
			     within Glade.
			  o Replace-Child functions to remove a child widget
			    and insert a new one in its place.
			  o Fill Empty functions that add placeholders to
			    containers so they can be used in Glade.
			  o Get Internal Child functions, that return a pointer
			    to an internal child widget given its name.
			  o Get/Set Child Packing Properties functions.

glade-widget.c		- GladeWidget is a struct containing information on
			  one widget in the interface.
			  Contains the class, name, and pointer to the actual
			  widget, and a list of GladeProperty for each property
			  and child packing property, and a hash of
			  GladeSignals.

glade-placeholder.c	- a GtkWidget to represent placeholders in the GUI.

glade-property-class.c	- GladePropertyClass is a struct containing information
			  about a property of a particular widget class.
			  It has a type, id, name, tooltip, a list of
			  GladeParameter, and optional get/set functions if
			  custom functions are necessary.

glade-property.c	- GladeProperty is a struct containing information
			  about a property of a particular widget.
			  It has a pointer to the corresponding
			  GladePropertyClass, a pointer to the GladeWidget,
			  and a GValue.

glade-parameter.c	- GladeParameter is a struct containing a key/value
			  pair of information about a GladeProperty, e.g. for
			  numeric properties there may be a minimum and maximum
			  value, or the property may be optional.

glade-command.c		- Undo/Redo action infrastructure.
			  Contains glade_command_undo()/redo().
			  glade_command_set_property()/set_name()
			  glade_command_delete()/create()/cut()/paste().
			  These create subclasses of GladeCommand to handle
			  undo/redoing particular actions.


Minor Files
===========

glade-choice.c		- handles &quot;choice&quot; properties, i.e. enums.
			  FIXME: should use GTK+ functions where available.
			  I'm not sure this is finished - I don't think it
			  could support custom choice properties yet.
			  Do we need to support custom choice properties?

glade-packing.c		- functions to handle child packing properties, mainly
			  of GtkTable and GtkBox since these need special
			  handling. Currently not used.

glade-cursor.c		- glade_cursor_set() can be called to set cursors on
			  windows. Only SELECTOR/ADD_WIDGET cursors for now.

glade-debug.c		- sets up GLib log error handlers for debugging.
			  Just does a G_BREAKPOINT().

glade-id-allocator.c	- allocates unique ID numbers for newly-created
			  widgets, e.g. 'label1', 'label2'.

glade-signal.c		- GladeSignal is a struct containing information
			  about a signal handler, i.e. its name, handler,
			  and whether it should run after the class method.

glade-transform.c	- contains GValue transformation functions, to convert
			  from strings to various types (I think).  
			  I'm not sure how/where these are used yet.

glade-utils.c		- various utility functions, including
			  glade_util_draw_nodes() - draws the selection handles

glade-xml-utils.c	- utility functions for handling XML files.

main.c			- contains main() function to initialize app.
			  parses command line, sets up debugging log handlers,
			  registers GValue transformation functions,
			  loads widget catalogs, creates project window,
			  opens projects if specified on command line, calls
			  gtk_main().
