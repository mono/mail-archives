<PRE>Hey

I haven't worked on it for almost 10months now. Anyway I think on however
I got on with it, the code seems to be on my code on my computer in India and
now I'm in Philadelphia, so its a slight problem ;-)

I'll see if I can get my mom to do a &quot;cvs diff -u&quot;, but thats possible
only if the local &quot;computer fixer&quot; didn't fuck up my linux partition when 
reinstalling windows on my home computer in India =D

I'll check
Archit

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Wasn't Archit working on this? Is your code working yet Archit?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd rather avoid this one if possible :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Very understandable :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; After the menu editor, yes, I think the next thing will be to check 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that all the widgets works as expected.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; While checking GtkWindow today I noticed a few things that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need fixing:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  o Problems drawing selection rectangles, e.g. in GtkWindow, GtkEntry.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    I had lots of problems with this in Glade, since the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; window you need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    to draw on isn't necessarily the widget's window (some widgets have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    more than one window and these may not cover the widget's entire
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    allocated area.) Maybe we should port the glade-2 code over. It is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    horrible code but we know it works pretty well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I took a look a while ago at the glade-2 code.  I think that hooking the
</I>&gt;<i> expose event on all the widgets, putting the expose region on the toplevel
</I>&gt;<i> widget coordinates, and draw a part of the selection rectangles if need will
</I>&gt;<i> we conceptually cleaner than what glade-2 does, but as I'll be also quite
</I>&gt;<i> happy with the glade-2 code :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  o Support for pixmap properties, e.g. for the window &quot;icon&quot; property.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  o Support for the event mask property.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These 3 bugs should be independent of the changes that I have in my hard
</I>&gt;<i> drive, so if you can start by these hopefully we will not step on each other
</I>&gt;<i> feet
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your help, Damon.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
