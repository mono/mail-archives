As far as I can see, these two bugs are fixed with my today commit.
If you still hit these problems, please let me know.

Is there any widget that should not have a tooltip?  If all the widgets
should have it, we can put it on gtkwidget.xml

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  o 'Allow shrink' &amp; 'Allow grow' properties probably 
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't be shown
</I>&gt;<i>    as I think they are deprecated (see gtkwindow.h).
</I>
Ok, I've removed these properties in gtkwidget.xml.

Cheers,
