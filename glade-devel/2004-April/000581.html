[I'm just lurking on this list, the following doesn't reflect the
position of the Glade team.]

I think it's simply because Glade was there on the Gnome desktop first. 
And I also have this impression Glade is more lightweight (in
dependencies) than XUL but I haven't really looked into it.


&gt;<i> I think this would be not such an easy task. XUL allows javascript and

</I>&gt;<i> CSS instead of its current style format then this would be a little bit 
</I>&gt;<i> easier. Also, perhaps if it was possible to embed gtk+ source code in a 
</I>&gt;<i> glade xml file
</I>&gt;<i> then this would also be possible. The point is the two are very different ;)
</I>
Well, I've been idly wondering why does Glade store both structure and
style in the same XML file while others (XHTML + CSS) are trying rather
hard to separate the two (more or less successfully.)

It should be rather straightforward to move spacings and other
properties outside the XML file into a separate stylesheet (using a
subset of CSS perhaps) and then you'd have something quite similar to
XUL:

&lt;GtkWindow id=&quot;window1&quot; _title=&quot;My Window&quot;&gt;
  &lt;GtkVBox id=&quot;vbox1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;GtkEntry id=&quot;entry1&quot; value=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;GtkEventBox id=&quot;eventbox1&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/GtkVBox&gt;
&lt;/GtkWindow&gt;

Embedding code... that's probably a harder problem.  Embedding C code
feels uncomfortable at least for me and adding JavaScript support is
quite a lot of work I guess.  It would be nice to be able to define
'Keep this button insensitive while this entry is empty' in the Glade
model, though.
