</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; o Invalidating the &quot;label&quot; property causes bindings to that label to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> become invalid, in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;fact anything which &quot;refers to that property&quot; is invalid, today
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this can only be a binding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;of another property.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; o A widget has a property which was bound to the &quot;label&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> property which was invalidated,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;as a consequence of that action, it's binding to the said
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> label is undoably cleared
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; o GladeWidgetAdaptor-&gt;evaluate_sensitivity ( use_command = TRUE
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ) is called on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;that target property's widget to re-evaluate sensitivity
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> states after having changed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;the binding state
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; o All widgets with any binding to the invalidated label finish
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> adjusting themselves to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;invalidation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; o Button editor calls GladeWidgetAdaptor-&gt;evaluate_sensitivity (
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use_command = TRUE )
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;on itself to evaluate the sensitivity after having changed it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> own &quot;edit mode&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; o Finally glade_command_pop_group() is hit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The &quot;invalidation&quot; above might be a signal from the source
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> GladeProperty which has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a strict meaning, or possibly just a function
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> glade_command_property_invalidate()
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which loops over all the targets, unsets them and resolves the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sensitivity of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> target widget.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure how the additional &quot;invalidation&quot; command you envision would
</I>&gt;<i> conceptually differ from glade_command_set_sensitive (sensitive = FALSE).
</I>&gt;<i> While I understand your intention, the fact that the property sensitivity
</I>&gt;<i> *does* affect the binding state still remains in your proposed design; it is
</I>
And enter the confusion:

   a.) Bindings use this virtual state of 'sensitivity' to clear themselves
   b.) Anything else... like activatable properties, looks at the code you
        wrote and decides that it's also a good idea to clear itself when it
        something goes insensitive
   c.) Code competes for real states because of insignificant
sensitivity changes

Yes, it is important that when one editor sets a property insensitive,
the binding
updates/clears itself, however it is also important that that clearing
is not simply
*because* of the sensitivity state.

At any rate, if you were to drive the project states from the sensitivity state,
you would still need to find a way to do it undoably while the sensitivity is
set as a command.

i.e. it's important that:

  a.) Editor sets activatable stuff that makes a property insensitive
  b.) Property undoably goes insensitive
  c.) Binding is undoably unset

a, b and c have to happen as part of the same command group (so you
cant very well listen to a sensitivity changed signal and clear the
binding state).

&gt;<i> just indirected by the &quot;invalidate&quot; command. Also, the &quot;invalidation&quot; logic
</I>&gt;<i> in the Editor would inevitably duplicate the logic in
</I>&gt;<i> GladeWidgetAdaptor-&gt;evaluate_property_flags() (or -&gt;evaluate_sensitivity(),
</I>&gt;<i> we we're going to call it), meaning that changes to that logic alway
</I>&gt;<i> requires modifications to two places (error-prone). In short, I think this
</I>&gt;<i> needlessly complicates things without benefit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For reference, this is how the process works currently in the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;command-set-sensitive&quot; branch:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. The Editor does glade_command_group_push() and does what it has always
</I>&gt;<i> done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Editor calls &quot;GladeWidgetAdaptor-&gt;adjust_property_flags (use_command =
</I>&gt;<i> TRUE)&quot;. That function's implementation uses
</I>&gt;<i> glade_command_set_property_sensitive(), which checks whether any bindings
</I>&gt;<i> become invalidated by the sensitivity change and, in turn, calls
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;glade_command_bind_property (binding_target, NULL)&quot; as needed (grouped with
</I>&gt;<i> the original sensitivity-setting command).
</I>
Right, so in this specific step we have code that explicitly writes out that if
you set a property insensitive... *only* bindings are effected, which singles
out bindings as some kind of a special case feature.

This is where a generalized &quot;clear property&quot; with a general meaning would
be better.

Historically you need to know that all the worst code ends up in glade-command.c
because we are too lazy to do things properly, then we add adaptor methods to
do things more generically and pull hard-code out of glade-command.c... I'm just
trying to avoid that.

Cheers,
      -Tristan

</I>&gt;<i> 3. Editor calls glade_command_pop_group().
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On loading a widget, -&gt;adjust_property_flags() with use_command=FALSE is
</I>&gt;<i> called.
