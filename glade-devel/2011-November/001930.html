</I>&gt;<i> complexity of Glade that that will bite us later on).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, for the scenario you described above, functionally speaking I
</I>&gt;<i> think this needs
</I>&gt;<i> to happen:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    o Button editor sets the edit mode and does glade_command_push_group()
</I>&gt;<i>    o Button editor does it's normal command group routines
</I>&gt;<i>    o Button editor invalidates the &quot;label&quot; property (note: this
</I>&gt;<i> invalidation does not exist)
</I>&gt;<i>    o Invalidating the &quot;label&quot; property causes bindings to that label to
</I>&gt;<i> become invalid, in
</I>&gt;<i>       fact anything which &quot;refers to that property&quot; is invalid, today
</I>&gt;<i> this can only be a binding
</I>&gt;<i>       of another property.
</I>&gt;<i>        o A widget has a property which was bound to the &quot;label&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> property which was invalidated,
</I>&gt;<i>           as a consequence of that action, it's binding to the said
</I>&gt;<i> label is undoably cleared
</I>&gt;<i>        o GladeWidgetAdaptor-&gt;evaluate_sensitivity ( use_command = TRUE
</I>&gt;<i> ) is called on
</I>&gt;<i>           that target property's widget to re-evaluate sensitivity
</I>&gt;<i> states after having changed
</I>&gt;<i>           the binding state
</I>&gt;<i>    o All widgets with any binding to the invalidated label finish
</I>&gt;<i> adjusting themselves to the
</I>&gt;<i>       invalidation
</I>&gt;<i>    o Button editor calls GladeWidgetAdaptor-&gt;evaluate_sensitivity (
</I>&gt;<i> use_command = TRUE )
</I>&gt;<i>       on itself to evaluate the sensitivity after having changed it's
</I>&gt;<i> own &quot;edit mode&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>    o Finally glade_command_pop_group() is hit
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;invalidation&quot; above might be a signal from the source
</I>&gt;<i> GladeProperty which has
</I>&gt;<i> a strict meaning, or possibly just a function
</I>&gt;<i> glade_command_property_invalidate()
</I>&gt;<i> which loops over all the targets, unsets them and resolves the
</I>&gt;<i> sensitivity of the
</I>&gt;<i> target widget.
</I>
I am not sure how the additional &quot;invalidation&quot; command you envision 
would conceptually differ from glade_command_set_sensitive (sensitive = 
FALSE). While I understand your intention, the fact that the property 
sensitivity *does* affect the binding state still remains in your 
proposed design; it is just indirected by the &quot;invalidate&quot; command. 
Also, the &quot;invalidation&quot; logic in the Editor would inevitably duplicate 
the logic in GladeWidgetAdaptor-&gt;evaluate_property_flags() (or 
-&gt;evaluate_sensitivity(), we we're going to call it), meaning that 
changes to that logic alway requires modifications to two places 
(error-prone). In short, I think this needlessly complicates things 
without benefit.

For reference, this is how the process works currently in the 
&quot;command-set-sensitive&quot; branch:

1. The Editor does glade_command_group_push() and does what it has 
always done.

2. Editor calls &quot;GladeWidgetAdaptor-&gt;adjust_property_flags (use_command 
= TRUE)&quot;. That function's implementation uses 
glade_command_set_property_sensitive(), which checks whether any 
bindings become invalidated by the sensitivity change and, in turn, 
calls &quot;glade_command_bind_property (binding_target, NULL)&quot; as needed 
(grouped with the original sensitivity-setting command).

3. Editor calls glade_command_pop_group().

On loading a widget, -&gt;adjust_property_flags() with use_command=FALSE is 
called.

Denis
