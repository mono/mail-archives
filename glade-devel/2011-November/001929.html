Thanks that's what I wanted to start getting at.

I think that it's obvious the mechanism is needed, but I dont think that we
should clear bindings based on sensitivity state, in other words I would much
rather that sensitivity always be the last thing which is evaluated based
on other real states (it doesnt seem to make sense that we drive a 'real'
project state based on the 'virtual' sensitivity state, and I fear with the
complexity of Glade that that will bite us later on).

So, for the scenario you described above, functionally speaking I
think this needs
to happen:

  o Button editor sets the edit mode and does glade_command_push_group()
  o Button editor does it's normal command group routines
  o Button editor invalidates the &quot;label&quot; property (note: this
invalidation does not exist)
  o Invalidating the &quot;label&quot; property causes bindings to that label to
become invalid, in
     fact anything which &quot;refers to that property&quot; is invalid, today
this can only be a binding
     of another property.
      o A widget has a property which was bound to the &quot;label&quot;
property which was invalidated,
         as a consequence of that action, it's binding to the said
label is undoably cleared
      o GladeWidgetAdaptor-&gt;evaluate_sensitivity ( use_command = TRUE
) is called on
         that target property's widget to re-evaluate sensitivity
states after having changed
         the binding state
  o All widgets with any binding to the invalidated label finish
adjusting themselves to the
     invalidation
  o Button editor calls GladeWidgetAdaptor-&gt;evaluate_sensitivity (
use_command = TRUE )
     on itself to evaluate the sensitivity after having changed it's
own &quot;edit mode&quot;
  o Finally glade_command_pop_group() is hit

The &quot;invalidation&quot; above might be a signal from the source
GladeProperty which has
a strict meaning, or possibly just a function
glade_command_property_invalidate()
which loops over all the targets, unsets them and resolves the
sensitivity of the
target widget.

Essentially I think it's just a simple nuance from what you have planned, only
that the sensitivity should be based on real data and not the other way around.

Also, you will find a hand full of use cases where properties go
sensitive/insensitive
without the help of a custom editor, perhaps we need to &quot;resolve sensitivity&quot; on
any widget any time that any of it's properties are set by a GladeEditorProperty
(i.e. once in glade_editor_property_commit())... not sure if that
would slow things down
very much when editing string properties...

Cheers,
       -Tristan
