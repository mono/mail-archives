<PRE>Hi,

After an unfortunate longer period of inactivity, I am happy to tell you 
that I started to work on bringing GObject property binding support to 
Glade again where I left off last summer after GSoC [1]. (By the way, I 
passed final evaluation! Thanks to everyone involved! Thank for 
mentoring me, Juan! :) This message is intended as a quick update what I 
am doing now.

In my last message to this list [2], I mentioned that the current Glade 
codebase doesn't record changes to the sensitivity of properties (such 
as, e.g., making the &quot;label&quot; property of a GtkButton insensitive when 
that button is set to have a custom content widget) in its command 
(undo/redo) system, and that this makes it impossible to cleanly 
auto-remove property bindings that become invalid this way. Tristan 
identified this problem as a blocker to the adoption of the property 
binding branch [3] into master, so this is what I'm starting to tackle now.

For this purpose, I created a new branch named &quot;command-set-sensitive&quot; 
to convert all relevant property sensitivity changes to undoable 
commands. (I am not doing this in the &quot;gbinding&quot; branch directly to 
allow for easier isolated reviewing and testing.) The branch introduces 
the following (as loosely discussed with Tristan):

- A new command function, named glade_command_set_property_sensitive(), 
which sets the sensitivity of a single property undoably. Being more of 
a side effect, this command is always group with other commands (such as 
switching the content type of a GtkButton) and should never stand on its 
own.

- A new virtual function of GladeWidgetAdaptor, 
glade_widget_adaptor_adjust_property_flags(), which can be overridden 
for each type of widget to provide a property sensitivity policy. It 
accepts a &quot;use_command&quot; boolean parameter which tells the function 
whether to use the command system for sensititivity changes or call 
glade_widget_property_set_sensitive() directly. (The latter is required 
when the widget is first created, or when it is loaded from a file.)

- A port of a small portion of the GTK+ plugin to the new functions as 
an example. (Currently, only the GtkEntry-related port is ported.)

I hope that this work enables me to fix the last remaining big blocker 
bug before the property binding branch is ready for prime time. Any 
feedback is very welcome! (@Tristan: Please review when you find the time!)

Regards,
Denis
