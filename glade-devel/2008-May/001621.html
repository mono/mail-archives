And now I'm trying only to use glade in anjuta but it doesn't work
well, so I think at least the most important issues should be fixed.

&gt;<i>  Agreed, I introduced the one time idle (which is IMO more stable than a timeout)
</I>&gt;<i>  when I made glade show the first widget in a project inside the workspace at
</I>&gt;<i>  project load time.
</I>
That's good until somebody else uses idle too like Anjuta does.

&gt;<i>  The real root of this problem is that gtk+ does not support embedding
</I>&gt;<i>  of toplevel
</I>&gt;<i>  windows, the best way to deal with this would be to rally for support
</I>&gt;<i>  in gtk+ and
</I>&gt;<i>  provide patches to gtk+ to this effect, other than that there may be a
</I>&gt;<i>  way to work
</I>&gt;<i>  around the idle approach and make it all work synchronously, but it would also
</I>&gt;<i>  be a hack and as they say &quot;if its not broke dont fix it&quot; :)
</I>
And what about GtkPlug?
