<PRE>Hello,

I am fairly new to Gtk+ development and certainly new to using Glade 
(currently 3.4.2 under Ubuntu 8.04). Glade is excellent and makes it 
much easier for me to develop new interfaces quickly. So, thank you for 
your work!

I would like to bring a couple of bugs that I have noticed to your 
attention. My apologies if they are well known or I am not submitting 
them through the correct channels - I looked on the Glade site but 
didn't see an obvious method to report them, so here I am instead.

1) Adding a new Combo Box widget to a VBox causes Glade to hang and then 
crash when I try to enter anything in the 'Items:' list. Very reproducible.

2) Some weirdness when editing the Label property of a GtkLabel: editing 
anywhere in the input string is hampered by the cursor jumping to the 
end of the entered string as soon as a new character is typed. You find 
yourself having to enter one character and then move the cursor back to 
where you want to enter the next character. Very reproducible.

If I can provide more information that will help you with these bugs 
please let me know.

Thank you,

Chris
