Ok Im not familliar with any well known hangs at anjuta startup, but I'll
try to clarify something for you.

Object properties are an interface to the object, a realized widget should
not be a prerequisite of setting an object property, if there are bugs in
some objects that is an issue. A widget object needs to use the proper
flags (i.e. GTK_WIDGET_REALIZED(), GTK_WIDGET_MAPPED()) to
operate correctly and at times deffer execution until realize time.

Bottom line, objects should react well to property settings, and with
widgets it can get tricky, Im not aware of any serious bugs in widgets
in gtk+ in this regard, if you know any such bugs, please share them
with us ;-)

Cheers,
