Cool, I tried it and it all looks very nice.

Some things:
  - When clicking on the resize-grip-window-title-tab-thingy,
    it would be nice to cause that to select the window
    (I don't know, it just feels strange to me that selection
    doesn't follow the window you are currently interacting with).

  - We still have the 2 bugs:

    o When I open the glade file with a toolpalette that
      I'm attaching here... the group-header widget still
      goes into the workspace instead of into the palette.

    o When I open glom.glade, some widgets dont get their
      full vertical size, I have no idea why that's happening
      but I suspect that the GladeDesignLayout is not requesting
      enough vertical space (this bug naturally never showed 
      before because the request of a scrollable widget is
      somewhat unimportant, it always receives the full size
      of the scrolled window content area anyway).

I know you're aware of these bugs already, just wanted to sum up
where we are with the branch... we can merge as soon as we fix
these 2 problems.

As I mentioned in a previous mail, adding widgets to the
GladeDesignLayout needs to follow the GladeWidget's visible
state... so... when adding a toplevel widget to the project;
the GladeWidget's visible state has to be checked... furthermore,
when glade_widget_show/hide() is called, it has to cause the
widget to be added/removed from the GladeDesignLayout where
appropriate (i.e. if glade_widget_show() is called on a previously
hidden GladeWidget *and* the GladeWidget is indeed toplevel *and*
it's in the project... then it should appear).

I think this can be done pretty straightforwardly by adding
a signal to the GladeProject and a property to the GladeWidget:

  - GladeWidget:visible property

  - GladeProject::widget-visibility-changed signal with a 
    signature like:

    void visibility_changed (GladeProject *project,
                             GladeWidget  *widget);

By handling the &quot;visibility-changed&quot; signal of GladeProject
and by inspecting glade_widget_is_visible() add &quot;add-object&quot;
time, the GladeDesignView should be able to easily add/remove
toplevels from itself according to the project and visible
state of widgets (glade_widget_show/hide() would then be
responsible for notifying the project and calling
glade_project_notify_visibility_changed() to notify about 
widget visibility...).

Sounds reasonable ?

Cheers,
       -Tristan
