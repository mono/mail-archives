I quickly looked at the branch.

Actually I dont mind that the design-view adds/removes widgets to
the layout by itself... however as I mentioned on irc last night,
this has to dynamically change when a GladeWidget becomes
visible/invisible (i.e. glade_widget_show/hide())

Currently the GladeWidget already tracks a &quot;visible&quot; flag, 
it should be exported as a property and have a
glade_widget_get_visible() api so that GladeDesignView
can check that to decide whether or not to add the child
to the view.

So probably all this needs:
   - A project signal to indicate that GtkDesignView's connected
     to the project should update which child is visible
     &quot;widget-visibility-changed&quot; for instance.

   - An exported property and api from GladeWidget for
     GladeWidget-&gt;priv-&gt;visible

   - glade_widget_show/hide() to provoke the project signal
     to fire

   - GladeDesignView to catch the &quot;visibility-changed&quot; signal
     on it's GladeProject and update visible toplevels from
     there.

I also like how the GladeDesignView updates the selection of
it's internal GladeDesignLayouts based on project selection
changes, this should however get rid of the code in 
glade_project which does this explicitly.

Cheers,
         -Tristan
