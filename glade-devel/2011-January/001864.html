<PRE>Hi,
   This is the second instalment on the Glade 3.9 cycle
leading up to Glade 3.10 and it depends on GTK+3 (version &gt;= 2.99).

This is not a stable release and is for testing purposes only.

Highlights of this release include:
  - Johannes Schmid rewrote the signal editor to use an internal
    GtkTreeModel data model that watches the signals of a Glade
    widget, this is to improve IDE integration with Anjuta 
    (specifically Drag'n'Drop of signals).
  - GtkToolPalette can now be edited in Glade
  - GtkTextTagTable gets an editor and can now have GtkTextTag children.

What is Glade?
============
Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick &amp; easy development of user
interfaces for the GTK+ toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment. 
The user interfaces designed in Glade are saved as XML, and by using 
the GtkBuilder GTK+ object these can be loaded by applications
dynamically as needed.

By using GtkBuilder, Glade XML files can be used in numerous
programming languages including C, C++, C#, Vala, Java, Perl, 
Python, and others. 


===========
Glade 3.9.1
===========
	- Added accelerator and tooltip-text properties to menu items
          and toolitems in the menu editor (fixes bug 510083).
	- Fixed crashes in liststore editor.
	- Restored italic insensitive state for the &lt; search widgets &gt;
          text in the inspector search box.
	- Fixed glade.desktop.in.in file to refer to the new 'glade'
          exec name (fix by Emilio Pozuelo Monfort)
	- Added support for editing GtkToolPalette along with a special
	  tool palette editor.
	- Make GtkToolBar:icon-size an optional property generally set
	  by the theme/settings (like GtkToolBar:toolbar-style
          property).
	- Removed global selection list from glade-utils.[ch], now all
	  selection is controlled by the relevant project
	- Removed glade_util_class_implements_interface() in favor of
	  g_type_is_a() (closes bug 455734, based on original patch from
	  Juan Pablo Ugarte).
	- Applied patch by Sergio Garc&#237;a Lobo to fix bug 487656 and
	  provide mnemonic key access to &quot;Text beside icons&quot; palette
	  option.
	- Added idle function to raise the undocked windows at startup
	  time, closes bug 475421.
	- Fix possible crash when saving new project. bug 622635, 
	  fix by Martin Schlemmer.
	- Fixed crash when user performs Drag'n'Drop of 
	  &lt; enter column here &gt; and no columns are yet added 
	  (bug 633943).
	- Fixed use of uninitialized variables in warning messages, 
	  bug 634325, fix by Alex Merry.
	- Set some default HIG values for widgets as per bug 349447.
	- Make query dialog come with a &quot;Create&quot; button instead of 
	  an &quot;OK&quot; button, closes hig bug 503621.
	- Added GtkTextTagTable editor, now GtkTextTag can be added 
	  to GtkTextTagTable.
	- Made all GdkColor type properties optional, closes bug 457969.
	- Fixed add/remove parent context menu actions so that they 
	  work with parentless widget references (i.e. you can add a
	  parent to a GtkToolItemGroup's label widget or a GtkButton's
	  image widget, or remove the parent of a child of a
	  label-widget, etc).
	- Expose internal GtkTreeSelection child of GtkTreeView so that
	  &quot;changed&quot; signal can be connected to. Fixes bug 383766.
	- Included Johannes Schmid's new signal editor work, the
	  GladeSignals are now available via a GtkTreeModel
	  implementation, this does not effect the UI much but allows
	  signals to be Drag'n'Dropped from Glade's signal editor to
	  Anjuta somewhere.
	- Restored GtkFixed/GtkLayout background pattern.
	- Restored old GladePlaceholder background pattern.
	- Fixed mismatching PangoAttributeType with GType, 
	  closes bug 597045.

Where can I get it ?
