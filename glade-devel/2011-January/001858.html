<PRE>... And so it was, that yet another GNOME module updated itself to build
against the mighty forces of GTK+ 3.0 ... and they lived happily
ever ...

That's right folks, Glade for GTK+ 3.0 is here... this is the first
development release leading up to Glade 3.10 which will run against
GTK+ 3.0, currently this software builds and runs against the latest
GTK+ git master.

Few things I need/would like to mention for this release:

Plans:
-----
   Let it be known that we plan to release a stable Glade 3.8
and a stable Glade 3.10 in parallel for GNOME 3.

Glade 3.8:  Will include all support Glade has always included
            for GTK+ up till version 2.24.
Glade 3.10: Will include support only for widgets that are still
            included in GTK+ 3.0 and additionally drops support
            for Libglade.

They will of course be parallel installable, Glade 3.8 in the long
term will hopefully serve as a decent migration path for older 
projects migrating to 3.0.

Thanks:
------

Thanks to all the contributors that helped to make this possible.

And thanks to Openismus GmbH who has sponsored this release
of Glade in a really big way.

What is Glade?
============
Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick &amp; easy development of user
interfaces for the GTK+ toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment. 
The user interfaces designed in Glade are saved as XML, and by using 
the GtkBuilder GTK+ object these can be loaded by applications
dynamically as needed.

By using GtkBuilder, Glade XML files can be used in numerous
programming languages including C, C++, C#, Vala, Java, Perl, 
Python, and others. 

===========
Glade 3.9.0
===========

	- General build fixes for building with GTK+ 3.0, including   
          patches from Johannes Schmid, Matthias Clasen, Javier Jard&#243;n
          and Juan Pablo Ugarte.
	- Included the new Preview feature by 
          Marco Diego Aur&#233;lio Mesquita.
	- Various leaks and crashes fixed.
	- GladeWidget becomes GInitiallyUnowned, refcounting improved
          for project dispose cycles.
	- Handle combo-box entry child properly (bug 581580).
	- Fixed crashes when textview's buffer is deleted, fix by 
          Martin Schlemmer, bug 609748.
	- Restored property order of project objects at save time 
          (glade files no longer container irrelevant diffs).
	- Hide editor properties when the property is not available on
          the widget, bug 585299, 
	  fix by Marco Diego Aur&#233;lio Mesquita.
	- Fixed makefiles as per bug 521713 (patch initially by 
          Daniel Macks).
	- Fixed mixups of properties vs packing properties (bug 637475).
	- Fixed class header of GladeEditor to update when widgets
          unload (patch by  Marco Diego Aur&#233;lio Mesquita, bug 637541).
	- Fixed particalarly nasty crasher bug when loading/saving
          treestore column definitions, special thanks goes to 
          Benjamin Otte, bug 637563.
	- Add progress bar to notebook tab of currently loading 
          project (now the whole UI doesnt jam up while loading a 
          big project).
	- Fixed notebook tab style to use the new CSS stuff.
	- Removed widgets that are not available in 3.0
	- Completely removed Libglade support
	- Removed GladeClipBoardView completely
	- Removed GladeParameter obsolete code
	- Fixed editor labels to use natural word wrapping
	- Drop GtkTables in editors in favor of GtkGrid
	- Added custom editor for editing GtkActionGroup and managing
          child actions
	- Ran 'indent' on source base, new Glade coding style more
          similar to GTK+ style
	- Removed boolean &quot;fixed&quot; catalog attribute, instead
          &lt;create-widget-function&gt; can be used to specify a derived
          GladeWidget to be used in the runtime.
	- Use locale-independent strtod &amp; dtostr. Fixes bug 616787, 
          fix by Christian Persch.
	- Applying patch to allow better builds on win32, 
          patch by Dieter Verfaillie, bug 634978.
	- Fixed loaded state of use-action-appearance so that it always
	  loads as FALSE if there is no &quot;related-action&quot; at load time
          (closes bug 582882).
	- Sealed entire core API, libgladeui-2 will be ABI stable 
          after 3.10 release.
	- Removed GladeApp::update-ui signal, active-project, 
          selection handling and implied commands, everything now must
          be done in context of a GladeProject.
	- Optimized GladeEditor to load a widget faster by keeping all
          the cached pages in internal vboxes and not remove/adding them
          but just hide/showing them (improves object selection time).
	- Optimized frontend to load one palette per project, verifying
          the palette for version information when the related project
          is set costs around 1 second, this is now only experienced
          when the target version is changed in the project prefs 
	  dialog.

Where can I get it ?
