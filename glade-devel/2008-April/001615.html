<PRE>Hey Kunal,

Yes it is definitely possible to take a UI designed in Glade and use
it in a Qt program. This is because Glade spits out a XML file
describing the UI. And then there is libglade that reads the .glade
XML file and creates the UI by making calls to the Gtk+ library.  So
its definitely possible to write a libglade for Qt which reads in
.glade files and creates a corresponding Qt interface.

I don't know if anyone's written a libglade for Qt, but its definitely
possible. One problem I see happening is that different UI systems
take slightly different approaches to layout mechanisms.

Hope that helps,
- Archit

</I>&gt;<i>    So, I have decided to familiarize (actually more than just familiarize)
</I>&gt;<i>  myself with at least one GUI tool-kit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    I had two options to choose from GTK+ and Qt.
</I>&gt;<i>    I have decided to go for GTK+.
</I>&gt;<i>    I will initially focus on GUI design using Glade.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    While I am picking up on Glade, a thought keep on striking my mind. What
</I>&gt;<i>  if I some client asks me to design a product with Qt for him?
</I>&gt;<i>    I know that being a GTK+ user, my first effort should be to convince him
</I>&gt;<i>  that GTK+ can do as good (or ever far better than) job as Qt. But, what if
</I>&gt;<i>  he just wants to go for Qt (he has a stable platform based on Qt)? The only
</I>&gt;<i>  choice which I will have in that case will be to hire a resource who has a
</I>&gt;<i>  good hold on &quot;Qt-Designer&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I think that there should be an interface builder, which does not care
</I>&gt;<i>  about the underlying tool-kit (whether GTK or Qt). I have two questions:
</I>&gt;<i>     (a) Is it technically feasible (I guess the answer is YES).
</I>&gt;<i>     (b) Is any such tool already available (I guess the answer is NO).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      If (a) is YES and (b) is NO, does it makes sense to enhance glade so
</I>&gt;<i>  as to support the Qt as well? It will help development engineers to just
</I>&gt;<i>  focus on the Interface builder details, without worrying about what is the
</I>&gt;<i>  underlying toolkit. glade will attract more user in that case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I am not sure if it will be feasible to modify Glade in such a way. May
</I>&gt;<i>  be Glade has already come to a shape where it can not be so easily modified
</I>&gt;<i>  for Qt support. In that case, may be it will make sense to think of a new
</I>&gt;<i>  project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      I am not sure if this is the right mailing list to post this question.
</I>&gt;<i>  But, I felt it is. So, I did it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>  Kunal
</I>&gt;<i>  www.singhkunal.com
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  PS: Nokia was initially using GTK+ for its internet tablet development
</I>&gt;<i>  platform &quot;Maemo&quot;. Now it has announced support (on the same platform) for
</I>&gt;<i>  Qt as well (not sure if it has something to do with Qt acquisition). In
</I>&gt;<i>  future more platforms might support both GTK+ And Qt. In such a scenario a
</I>&gt;<i>  Unified GUI builder will come handy
