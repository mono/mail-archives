The output of Glade is xml, but it is serialized GObjects basically,
how well that
scales to QT I dont know, Im quite sure QT uses different container objects, but
something could be written I suppose, but in the end it will be black
magick trickery,
nothing as optimal as using an interface designer intended for the
targetted toolkit.

Consider that the different toolkits have different objects to
represent that work in
different ways, spitting out a QT targetted xml file from glade would
be like a whole
other project inside Glade, in other words I see no reason to not just
do it in QT
designer if you want a QT interface.

Cheers,
                  -Tristan

BTW: I started hacking on Glade from an embedded standpoint, the whole point
of me taking up the Glade 3 project in the state it was in years ago,
was to be able
to modularly integrate our custom gtk+ widget kit into Glade, Glade was intended
for this, so I sincerely hope to see people start integrating their
catalogs into glade
and experience the power we've been working to provide for you.

Note that in recent days when I went ahead and ploughed through
GtkBuilder support
for glade, I completely rewrote and updated the documentation
concerning integrating
your widgets into Glade. The updated docs for Glade trunk can be found here:
