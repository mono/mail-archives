<PRE>Hi,
        This is the first development release leading up to Glade 3.6
(which in turn will be targetting GNOME 2.24), its the first shot at GtkBuilder
support in Glade, and already comes with fresh docs, which can currently
be viewed at <A HREF="http://glade.gnome.org/docs/index.html">http://glade.gnome.org/docs/index.html</A> .

Special thanks to Johan Dahlin who has been throwing huge UIManager
support patches at me and this way helping me keep the core in check
to the GtkBuilder's special needs.

Good thing this happened near the beginning of the GNOME release
cycle, now you can all convert your old glade files and tell us early
what is breaking, please ! :D

What is Glade ?
===============
Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick &amp; easy development of user interfaces
for the Gtk+ toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment.
The user interfaces designed in Glade are stored in XML format,
enabling easy integration with external tools.
In particular libglade can load the XML files and create the interfaces
at runtime. The DTD for the XML files is included with libglade, and is
also at <A HREF="http://glade.gnome.org/glade-2.0.dtd.">http://glade.gnome.org/glade-2.0.dtd.</A>
Other tools are available which can turn the XML files into source code
in languages such as C++, Perl and Python.

===========
Glade 3.5.0
===========
        - Resurrected GtkScaleButton and GtkVolumeButton
        - We finally have Vincent Geddes's icon choser dialog
          (was skipped before because of string changes)
        - Not allowed to have duplicate widget names anymore (bug 442860)
        - Now the first widget in a project shows up automatically
          when opening the project.
        - Old parser was trashed and rewritten from the ground up.
        - New plugin support for read_widget() and write_widget(), also
          create_eprop() which allows the plugin to create widgets to
          edit properties in the editor (accelerators are edited from
          the plugin now for instance).
        - Dual file format support available, its a beginning, you dont
          get any of the GObjects that GtkBuilder supports but all widgets
          you were formerly using with glade can now be loaded/saved in
          builder format.
        - Api reference docs for embedders and widget authors ressurected
          after 2 years, concerning integrating widgets, the docs are
          practically rewritten.

New and updated translations
============================
        - Priit Laes (et)
        - Laurent Dhima (sq)
        - Baris Cicek (tr)
        - Alexander Shopov (bg)

Where can I get it ?
====================
