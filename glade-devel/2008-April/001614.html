<PRE>Hi All,
 
   I am an embedded system developer.
   Off recently, GUI Design has gained (and is gaining) a critical
importance in EMbedded Systems.
   So, I have decided to familiarize (actually more than just familiarize)
myself with at least one GUI tool-kit.

   I had two options to choose from GTK+ and Qt.
   I have decided to go for GTK+.
   I will initially focus on GUI design using Glade.

   While I am picking up on Glade, a thought keep on striking my mind. What
if I some client asks me to design a product with Qt for him?
   I know that being a GTK+ user, my first effort should be to convince him
that GTK+ can do as good (or ever far better than) job as Qt. But, what if
he just wants to go for Qt (he has a stable platform based on Qt)? The only
choice which I will have in that case will be to hire a resource who has a
good hold on &quot;Qt-Designer&quot;.

    I think that there should be an interface builder, which does not care
about the underlying tool-kit (whether GTK or Qt). I have two questions:
    (a) Is it technically feasible (I guess the answer is YES).
    (b) Is any such tool already available (I guess the answer is NO).
    
     If (a) is YES and (b) is NO, does it makes sense to enhance glade so
as to support the Qt as well? It will help development engineers to just
focus on the Interface builder details, without worrying about what is the
underlying toolkit. glade will attract more user in that case.

    I am not sure if it will be feasible to modify Glade in such a way. May
be Glade has already come to a shape where it can not be so easily modified
for Qt support. In that case, may be it will make sense to think of a new
project.

     I am not sure if this is the right mailing list to post this question.
But, I felt it is. So, I did it.

Regards,

PS: Nokia was initially using GTK+ for its internet tablet development
platform &quot;Maemo&quot;. Now it has announced support (on the same platform) for
Qt as well (not sure if it has something to do with Qt acquisition). In
future more platforms might support both GTK+ And Qt. In such a scenario a
Unified GUI builder will come handy
