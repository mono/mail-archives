<PRE>Hello,

Sorry to bother you again about this issue. I am using glade 3.10.0 on
Ubuntu 11.10.
I am working on an open source project where I have a large glade file
which I have
converted from glade 2 to glade 3. Now most of it displays fine in glade 3
but when I try
to save it I get the following long list of errors. Any idea of whether
they are benign or
not and how I can make them go away if possible?

Thanks a lot for your kind help,

Saku

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi all,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To add to my email, how do I install glade 2 on Ubuntu 11.10?
