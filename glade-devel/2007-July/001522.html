Hmmm, 
   - glade_app_get_project ()
   - glade_project_get_objects ()
   - loop through objects, GTK_IS_WINDOW (object) ?
     + glade_widget_show (glade_widget_get_from_gobject (object))

That should do it (note that there is no &quot;first&quot; widget, although
chance might have it that this will get you the widget that is on
top in the widget tree/inpsector)

&gt;<i> 2) There are some Gtk-Criticals in the glade code when you embed it in

</I>
Sure, can you attach those to a bug report ?

You mean criticals in general or criticals as a result of parenting
the workspace widget into anjuta ?

I am assuming the later, there will always be criticals comming from
gtk+ widgets that are getting properties set to values that they
dont like - we catch them as they come and sometimes they are introduced
by new properties in gtk+.. so we just got to keep running after them.

&gt;<i> One other thing: It would be really nice if you could remind us (with
</I>&gt;<i> bugzilla or mail) when you change API in your development version
</I>&gt;<i> because it breaks our build. Of course we don't care about API

</I>&gt;<i> care about ABI at this point)
</I>
Ok, I'll make a point to make sure all API breaks (not additions) are
announced.

Cheers,
                   -Tristan
