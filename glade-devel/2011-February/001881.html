<PRE>Hi,
   This is the third instalment on the Glade 3.9 cycle
leading up to Glade 3.10 and it depends on GTK+3 (currently 
GTK+ version &gt;= 2.99).

Highlights in this release include:
  - Off screen rendering of project widgets, fancy selection drawing
  - All project widgets are viewable in the same workspace widget
    (scroll through the workspace and see every widget in your project).
  - GtkComboBoxText support and a fancy little editor to easily edit
    the items added to a GtkComboBoxText
  - GtkFileFilter and GtkRecentFilter, now setup a list of patterns
    and mime-types to add to your filters.

What is Glade?
============
Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick &amp; easy development of user
interfaces for the GTK+ toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment. 
The user interfaces designed in Glade are saved as XML, and by using 
the GtkBuilder GTK+ object these can be loaded by applications
dynamically as needed.

By using GtkBuilder, Glade XML files can be used in numerous
programming languages including C, C++, C#, Vala, Java, Perl, 
Python, and others. 

===========
Glade 3.9.2
===========
- Added signal for IDEs to track created signal editors, 
  Johannes Schmid.
- Stop installing catalog .xml.in files, Emilio Pozuelo Monfort.
- Fixed various memory leaks.
- Removed GtkTreeSelection from the palette, it's only available as 
  the internal child of a GtkTreeView
- Fixed Drag'n'Drop image drawing with cairo for signal editor, 
  Johannes Schmid with help from Benjamin Otte.
- Fixed crashes and memory leaks in the GladeBaseEditor (the editor 
  used for menu editing and treeview editing and the like).
- Edit-&gt;Preferences is now File-&gt;Properties
- Removed option for project naming policies, object ids in 
  GtkBuilder are always unique across the whole file.
- Render project widgets in the workspace offscreen, this gives us 
  more power over the widgets (combo boxes can now be selected, 
  selection drawing is now enhanced), Juan Pablo Ugarte.
- Added support for GtkComboBoxText with a customized editor to 
  edit the combo box items.
- Added GtkRecentFilter and GtkRecentManager to the palette,
  GtkRecentFilter can specify patterns, mime-types and applications 
  for the filtering.
- Added support to edit patterns and mime-types for GtkFileFilter
- Added &lt;add-child-verify-function&gt; to the plugin backend, 
  we now use this to better police user activities in Glade 
  (notably, you cannot paste a widget that is not a GtkToolItem
  to a GtkToolBar or the like).
- Renamed various things from glade-3/glade3 to 'glade' 
  (the Glade icon, the bugzilla database, the git repository etc, 
  help from Javier Jard&#243;n).
- Glade now uses GtkApplication and is a single instance application.
- Added support for editing a GtkOffscreenWindow
- Changed the workspace to now include all toplevel project objects,
  selecting an object from the inspector causes the workspace to scroll
  to the selected widget, Juan Pablo Ugarte.
