Sure, after 5 years or so we get tired of going though all the details of
why its important to use resizable containers in GTK+.

Without getting into too many details, suffice it to say that GTK+ isnt
designed to work that way, and the GtkFixed and GtkLayout are just
very primitive implementations of a canvas (i.e. you will get better
results using coordinates + z coordinates in goocanvas or clutter
with a flying textures type environment).

&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> environment.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
Its just a question of writing an application that will naturally run
on different resulotions with different system font sizes.

The pain is just part of GTK+, on the other hand it would be
really great if somebody cared enough to enhance the Glade
workspace to better manipulate resizable containers in more
intuitive and comprehensible ways.

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With that in mind, just hold SHIFT key down in the workspace... or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> push the Drag/Resize button
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm in the process of changing part of a Dialog and I wanted to do some mock

</I>&gt;<i> with the Fixed container and I found it too painful.&#160; I guess I'll resort to
</I>&gt;<i> pen and paper.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the past I've used Visual Studio and/or SharpDevelop to do a mock up but

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I put on the toolbar because the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SHIFT key was so undiscoverable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even the icon was undiscoverable to me because I've used Glade in the past.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that a perfect open source world would have a Lua (or Python)

</I>&gt;<i> the features of Visual Basic and an advanced mode with the beloved
</I>&gt;<i> GtkBox's.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Again, using GtkBox is just the way its done in GTK+, in a perfect world
the GTK+ plugin for Glade would offer great support for GtkBox manipulation,
and then the goocanvas or clutter plugin would obviously work with coordinates,
because the toolkits are coordinate based -- GTK+ is simply not
coordinate based.

Cheers,
          -Tristan
