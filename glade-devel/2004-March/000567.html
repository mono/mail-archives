Thanks for that.

I think I'll just remove the Turbo Start altogether, since it is pretty
old.

But I don't think I can really remove the FAQ. It is meant to cover the
most common problems people have, so should be easily available from
within Glade. I may reformat it though, since yelp seems to have
problems with the DocBook tags used.
