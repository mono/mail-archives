Hi all,
    I'm building an application that is relying heavily on libglade and 
another xml binding.  I've noticed that because every part of the UI is
built using glade and loaded using libglade that there is a noticeable 
performance lag in loading the .glade files.  To give you an idea of the
size of these interface files here is a line count.

    195 simo-attached-documents.glade
   1030 simo_calendar_view.glade
    202 simo_dialogs.glade
   1306 simo_event_view.glade
    278 simo-fsa-msa-hsa-reimbursements-eob.glade
   3314 simo.glade
   1799 simo-home-view.glade
   1305 simo-person-med-visit-detail.glade
    101 simo-person-med-visit-summary.glade
    100 simo-person-summary.glade
   1009 simo-person-view.glade
    563 simo-plan-reimbursements-eob.glade
    152 simo_plan_view.glade
    158 simo-provider-payments.glade
    343 simo-sidebar-dialogs.glade
  11551 simo-wizards.glade
  23406 total

I'm not loading them all at once; In fact I only load them once and only 
when that part of the UI is requested.  My idea is to provide a method for
dumping the .glade into a binary format.  after looking into the 
libglade source it looks like it could be possible to bipass the xml 
parse code if this
binary file exists and then just fread the data into the libglade hash 
tables.  This should improve the load time by reducing the disk io.  (I 
think).
I also learned that this is not an original idea; it is in fact very 
similar to what mozilla has done to improve its startup performance with 
xul.  I thought
this would be something libglade would benefit from and that it would be 
good for me to bring this up on the list.

Has anyone started work on something like this?  If not i'd like to 
start work on it and get as much input as possible about different ways 
to approach
this.
