I tracked it down. It was a line in ~/.gtk-bookmarks that referenced a no 
longer accessible server via sftp. I guess when glade loads a file chooser it 
tries to connect to all the servers or something? If there's an invalid host 
it's ok, but if the host is valid but points to an ip address that doesn't 
exist or there's an non-existing ip address there, I get the massive delays. 
Anyone wanna try to verify this?
Thanks,
Dan
