I think you should work in glade3 as it requires more improvements in
HIG too.

You will also need to checkout libglade from cvs and apply this patch:

<A HREF="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=161903">http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=161903</A>

Last time I applied it, there were some conflicts.

This thing should have been resolved by now, but for some reason Jamesh
is taking unreasonable time to make a decision.
