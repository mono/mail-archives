<PRE>Ok, long long long awaited release of captive software:

Glade 3.7.2 the third development snapshot leading up to 3.8
is now fresh out of the oven ! (and the crowd goes *roar*).

WARNING, this is *not* widely tested and it's not a stable
release (please don't package me, wait for 3.8 and 3.10).

This release still depends on GTK+ 2.20, however 3.8 will
be the last Glade version supporting GTK+ 2.x series and
will depend on GTK+ 2.24 (the idea is to get a version
out that people can test with the GTK+ they have installed
before including all the fancy backported stuff available
in GTK+ 2.24).

This release comes with 2 particular highlights:

  - New Preview feature by Marco Diego Aur&#233;lio Mesquita

    Now it's possible to fire up a preview window from glade and
    see how your interface will look in real life, currently it
    does not do much but eventually we plan to allow configuration
    of specific desktop settings and themes to be set for the preview
    window (so that application designers can see how the UI will
    react under different desktop or mobile platform environments).

  - The Glade bug-list now contains ZERO known crasher bugs, please
    smoke test this baby and let us know if you find anything wrong
    (as specially crashers of course).

What is Glade?
============
Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick &amp; easy development of user
interfaces for the GTK+ toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment. 
The user interfaces designed in Glade are saved as XML, and by using 
the GtkBuilder GTK+ object these can be loaded by applications
dynamically as needed.

By using GtkBuilder, Glade XML files can be used in numerous
programming languages including C, C++, C#, Vala, Java, Perl, 
Python, and others. 

===========
Glade 3.7.2
===========
	- Use gtk_show_uri() instead of previous custom code in 
          place (Javier Jard&#243;n)
	- Fixed user/developer url locations (Javier Jard&#243;n)
	- Fixed ComboBox and IconView to include basic actions in 
          the popup menu
	- Revived the &quot;misc&quot; column on the project data model 
          (now the inspector shows whether a widget is an internal child
          or a frame's label or such, again).
	- Expose GtkAssistant:complete packing property (bug 529595).
	- Implemented Preview feature, Glade now includes a project
          previewing program that is accessible in the UI and runs as a
          child process (Marco Diego Aur&#233;lio Mesquita).
	- Ignore &quot;resize-mode&quot; property incase of crashes (as reported
          in bug 622996).
	- Fixed crash with notebook rebuilding children (bug 365462).
	- Fixed crasher bug 628233 (based on patch by: 
          ramz &lt;ramanathan dot nitt at gmail dot com&gt;).
	- GladeWidget is now GInitiallyUnowned (now refcounts balance
          again at project close time).
	- Fixed errors when undoing the addition of notebook pages.
	- Default adjustment page size -&gt; 0 (bug 585085).
	- Removing frame shadow (and label) from project preferences
          (bug 574098).
	- Setting dialog type-hint default to Dialog (closes old
          bug 459917).
	- Fixed floating project menus when context menu is fired
          (bug 141714).
	- Removed notion of project &quot;instance_count&quot; 
          (which is by now unused).
	- Avoid clearing the project selection from the 
          inspector (fixing bug 604322).
	- Set added treeviewcolumns to fixed sizing mode if the 
          treeview is set to use fixed height mode (closing bug 596480).
	- Fixed GtkComboBox to handle cell-layout children as well 
          as the possible internal entry (fixes bug 581580)
	- Notify GtkTreeIter changes when the widget name changes 
          (now the inspector updates when a widget name is 
          changed automatically).
	- Fixed crasher when adjusting project naming policy 
          (bug 622528, thanks goes to S&#233;bastien Granjoux and 
          Martin Schlemmer for looking at this one).
	- Fixed crashes when textview's buffer is deleted, fix by 
          Martin Schlemmer, bug 609748.
	- Defensively avoid crash when setting entry icon tooltips 
          on an entry with no icons set.

Where can I get it ?
