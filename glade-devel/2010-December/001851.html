I found that I needed

gnome-common
intltool
libxml2
libxslt
gnome-doc-utils

I installed
gnome-common 2.28.0
with ./configure --prefix=/c/gtkmm  no trouble

intltool 0.40.6
with ./configure --prefix=/c/gtkmm  no trouble

libxml2 2.7.8
with ./configure --prefix=/c/gtkmm
make failed

libxslt 1.1.22
with ./configure --prefix=/c/gtkmm  no trouble

gnome-doc-utils 0.20.2
with ./configure --prefix=/c/gtkmm  no trouble
make fails with
Traceback (most recent call last):

     import libxml2
ImportError: No module named libxml2

This seems to be a python problem.  Does this mean that I didn't
build a python part of libxml2 when I built that package?

</I>Thanks as long as I don't get tar all over me :-)
This would certainly make things easier although I would if possible
like to learn how to fix these dependencies.  Would you or anyone
else reading this be willing to help me on this?  Is there something
I have to do differently with building libxml2?  is the problem
elsewhere?  I did notice that the libxml2 source folder had a lot
of .py files but the prefix dir /c/gtkmm didn't have any of those
files.
