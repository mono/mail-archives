I don't think that you got confused because the icons were specially
confusing, but because in the &quot;oldpalette&quot; screenshot you had a TreeView in
the same place as the optionmenu.

&gt;<i> IMHO something like the old TreeView icon (which has a small tree
</I>&gt;<i> inside) would be better: the new icon is really similar to a Table.
</I>
The old CList icon looked like the new one (a table with a header). I don't
see how to put a tree inside a column of the icon, and make it aesthetically
pleasant.  As it can act like a CList or a CTree, I choose the easier
methaphore. I will give another shot to the tree inside the first column
idea, but I don't promise anything :-)

&gt;<i> About the OptionMenu I really don't know: I never liked the 
</I>&gt;<i> old icon, but the new icon is very similar to other different 
</I>&gt;<i> widgets. It looks like a paragraph of text with a vertical 
</I>&gt;<i> scrollbar (btw, do optionmenus have a scrollbar?).
</I>
The problem is that in fact the real widget looks almost the same as a
combobox. The old icon is quite dependent of the old gtk+ theme, so I don't
think we should imitate it. So here it's a &quot;I don't have anything better&quot;.
It was also one of the icons that I picked from straigh from the OpenOffice
stock icons done by jimmac... If he didn't find anything better, I don't
think I will do either :-)

&gt;<i> On the 
</I>&gt;<i> bright side, note that OptionMenu is deprecated in gtk+ 2.4 ;-)
</I>
fiuuuuffff :-)

Cheers,
