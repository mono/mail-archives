I'm not sure... wouldn't this lead to a much longer list, beside the
current way is similar to other tools like the Gimp or Dia. Can you post
some screenshots of the other RADs you mention?

&gt;<i> While we're at it, a restructuration of the placement of the widget would

</I>&gt;<i> (probably saner) placement, I would like to just put the items in
</I>&gt;<i> alphabetical order.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not yet sure, however, that it's a good idea...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Is it worth the pain?
A really simple things we can do however is better split the catalogs,
like moving some seldom used stuff in &quot;Additional&quot; or create a &quot;Standard
dialogs&quot; catalog for FileSelector, Image selector etc.
