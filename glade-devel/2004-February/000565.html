I don't think it is worth doing until GTK+ supports it. Otherwise you
may have to change it again.

I think you should wait until you have Glade-3 fully working, then you
can see all of the areas where GTK+ properties aren't sufficient.

If it was up to me, I'd just make 'response-id' a property of GtkButton,
and then in the documentation say that it is only useful when in a
dialog. That's a lot simpler than trying to fix it in GTK+!
