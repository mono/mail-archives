Yes, that's the object that sends the signal.

&gt;<i> and gobject

One would use the user_data parameter in the regular signal_connect for
that.  signal_connect_object specifically swaps the first argument of the
callback from &quot;instance&quot; to &quot;gobject&quot;, and is useful, for example, if you
want a button click to do something to some other object.

&gt;<i> So if I populate the 'Object' 
</I>&gt;<i> field this would not reference to the 'glade name' but to a string representation
</I>&gt;<i> of an object?
</I>
Your signal callback would get whatever object was referenced by the glade
name in the &quot;Object&quot; field, not the string, as its first argument.  Try it
and see what happens (if you were using Python instead of C, you'd have
tried it already ;}).  You can't use this to pass in static data like
strings or numbers.
