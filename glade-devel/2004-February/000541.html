I didn't know about those :) anyway I totally agree.

I was mostly thinking of widgets deprecated in gtk2-[024] like clist,
optionmenu etc.

Yeah, again 100% agree.

My only little concern is what happens when you try to open a glade
project which uses these widget?

Anyway it's something far from high prio, since we still have *not*
deprecated widgets which are broken ;-)
