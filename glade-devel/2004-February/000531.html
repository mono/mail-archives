</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I agree it wold be pretty nice.

</I>&gt;<i> But AFAIK there isn't this kind of container widget in gtk+ yet. Adding

Agreed I just thought if someone was going to rewrite the layout to add
this little gem :-)    As for copying and pasting code it is done all
the time with libegg so as long as the code would be easy to swap out
that would be the best option.

&gt;<i> IMHO both are something we shouldn't do, at least right now.
</I>&gt;<i> 1) we don't want other dependencies that gtk+ doesn't have.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) the palette is ~300 lines of simple code while a copy&amp;paste of this
</I>&gt;<i> new widget would alone be much more code and thus more bugs and
</I>&gt;<i> maintainance work.
</I>
Well the widget code would be an autonomous black box (OO is great) and
might make the main code simpler but I get where you are coming from.

&gt;<i> So I think that we should follow the KISS rule and first focus on making
</I>&gt;<i> glade-3 really work. Once that is done we can look for this kind of
</I>&gt;<i> enancement; hopefully this kind of widget at some point will be included
</I>&gt;<i> in gtk+.
</I>
Agreed.
