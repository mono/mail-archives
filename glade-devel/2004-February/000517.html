The problem is that the two sets mix really bad. Even icons done by the same
person (jimmac or tigert), with 24bpp sometimes don't mix well enough (as
they were not really done to be mixed), let's alone icons with different
bpp.

Please report all the icons you feel that are worse than the old ones, and I
will try to redo them.

</I>&gt;<i> the one for GtkEntry.
</I>
The difference will certainly be more visible if the label didn't have a
white background.  I will change it (it should look more like the old label,
just changing &quot;A&quot; by italic &quot;An&quot;) and send another screenshot when I will be
done.

Cheers,
