GtkImage doesn't support scaling the image, so we can't really support
it in Glade.

I think you'll have to use a custom widget to do this. (You could use
some of the old GnomePixmap code.)


&gt;<i> BTW, I am also interested in custom widgets with visual feedback, this
</I>&gt;<i> is that one can see the custom widget in the design window in its real
</I>&gt;<i> form. I am thinking something similar to the way a graphical java bean

</I>&gt;<i> Glade3 development? Bonobo components perhaps? I know there is a custom
</I>&gt;<i> widget in Glade2 but it gets drawed as a plain square. I am pushing my
</I>&gt;<i> luck here, but it would be great if this custom widgets could be placed
</I>&gt;<i> in a palette.
</I>
It is planned in Glade3. Bonobo components are partially supported in
Glade2, though I'm not sure how well they work.
