While there is always a new generation of hardware (we are migrating
from 800x600 --&gt; 1024x768), it still doesn't make sence to skin an
embedded device with relative coordinates, why ?

Here is an example, 
    I work at touchtunes (you can get an idea what it looks like here 
<A HREF="http://www.touchtunes.com/our_jukebox/">http://www.touchtunes.com/our_jukebox/</A> ). All widget graphics are custom
made using applications such as photoshop, studio4D, softimage etc...

The moment that we change screen resolution, we'll have to upgrade the
skinset to go with the appropriate hardware (we do also have some old
jukeboxes running in 640x480), but thats OK, thats just whats needed to
achieve a full-blown true-colour jukebox experience; with the exceptions
of a few custom widgets that we use which pre-composite thier graphics
to the parent widget, in most cases we just cant settle for scaled to
fit graphics;
the artist *has* to know what his work will look like pixel for pixel.

It is my opinion that as soon as you exit the desktop translatable accessible
mania of the home computer and enter custom UI's with the intention of
having a rocking look'n'feel that will apeal to the most computer illiterate
people; you need custom themes, and you need a fixed coordinate system.

Cheers,
                                                 -Tristan
