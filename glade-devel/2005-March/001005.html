That's unfortunate, and I hope there is some alternative. I hope that it
doesn't make life too confusing for regular glade users who don't have
these problems.

&gt;<i> The moment that we change screen resolution, we'll have to upgrade the

Most embedded software needs to be translated just as much as desktop
software, making automatic layout essential.
