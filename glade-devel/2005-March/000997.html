<PRE>Hi all,
    This is a feature that some of us have been wanting for a while now.
The basic idea is to have a method to optionaly generate gtkrc files 
as well as glade files for GUIs with specialized themes (possibly
by adding a &quot;Style&quot; tab to the editor).

The main argument against this is that it may interfere with theming 
consistancy in the desktop environment.

A developer shouldn't use GtkFixed for thier desktop applications, but OTOH
GtkFixed is the ideal solution for a target machine with a fixed resolution and
a full-screen application with a custom theme, the majority of Gtk+ application
developer may never use GtkFixed, but IMO it would be wrong to exclude
GtkFixed from Gtk+.

My standpoint here is that the theme editor should get in, but it has
to be clear
to the user that using custom themes will make there application have a 
different look-n-feel than the rest of the desktop if they were to use a custom 
theme.

Please send in your views on integration of Style editing in glade-3.

Cheers,
                                                        -Tristan
