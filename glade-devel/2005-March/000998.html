I don't think anybody ever writes software for a fixed resolution.
There's always a new generation of the target hardware.

I do hope we can hide GtkFixed completely from Glade.

If you can list some situations when a user would need to use this then
I could have an opinion. Otherwise, you are encouraging people to do bad
things without a reason. Like generating code.
