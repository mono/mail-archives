<PRE> Many years ago, I had the idea to start a style editor, and
my secret goal was to integrate it in glade ;-) It has never
been finished, because I haven't enough time (studies).

That was because my father is currently developping a software
under Windows, which used strong visual color controls. He was
using LabWindows/CVI from National Instruments, and was very happy
with their graphical gui editor. By the way, he was interested in
porting this software to linux, with minor changes. As CVI
generates C code, I told him to look at
Gtk/Glade. But he didn't have enough time to learn how to fill
gtkrc to have colors.

Now, he still uses LabWindows/CVI...

So, I rise my hand up to ask a style editor in glade :-)

&gt; I'd like to see glade support style editing. Some apps do need it, and
&gt; for legitimate reasons. For example, take a look at:
&gt; <A HREF="http://autopackage.org/screenshots/manager/manager-gtk=">http://autopackage.org/screenshots/manager/manager-gtk=</A>
.png
&gt; Notice the top title panel in white. The whole application would look
&gt; very boring if the title panel is gray like everything else.
&gt; Right now, I have to manually call gtk_widget_modify_bg(), but it would
&gt; be so much easier if I can just click on a few buttons in Glade.
