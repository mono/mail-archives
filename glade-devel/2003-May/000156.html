<PRE>Ok, I've fixed 1 &amp; 4.

2 &amp; 3 will take a bit more time, as our support of menus &amp; toolbars is
still not finished, but I will make sure that they load when we support
these items.

I'm still expecting bug to arise, but I hope that you will have to look
a bit harder to find them (just crossing my fingers ;-)

I've don't yet fixed the xml writter, so the format used to write and
the format used to read is a bit out of sync right now.  I will fix it
asap.

Thank you for your bug reports!

Cheers,

P.S.: As now I'm mainly using windows, and I don't have here a glade-2
windows' version, I'm not 100% sure that the results are exactly the
same ones as with glade-2, if someone can send me a link to the windows
version of glade-2, or screenshots of what am I supposed to see I will
be grateful :-)

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding opening Glade-2 files in Glade-3. The situation has 
</I>&gt;<i> improved, but as you expected there are still some more

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -1 empty_window.glade. When you try to open a glade file 
</I>&gt;<i> where one of the objects does not have any child-widgets (ie 
</I>&gt;<i> empty window, empty row in Vbox etc) then the file can not be opened.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -2 pulldown.glade. When there is a pulldown on the screen, 
</I>&gt;<i> Glade-3 produces the error &quot;Class not found GtkMenuItem&quot; and 
</I>&gt;<i> the file can not be opened.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -3 toolbar.glade The error &quot;Could not apply property from 
</I>&gt;<i> node: tooltips&quot; is produced.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -4 fixed.glade. Pretty much all tests using a fixed layout 
</I>&gt;<i> fail. Glade-3 even aborts here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I had many more errors, but they all had similar messages as 
</I>&gt;<i> described here. Will do more testing once fixes are in the 
</I>&gt;<i> product addressing theses issues.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
