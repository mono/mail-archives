Just for the record, I fully agree with the need to change the GUI to
&quot;modern times&quot;.
If something has prevented until now this change is that glade-3 was
simply not working, and fixing segfaults and adding basic functionality
has higher priority than fixing the GUI.

Hopefully we will be able to fix the GUI asap.

Cheers,
