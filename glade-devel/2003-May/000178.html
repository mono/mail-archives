Each time this subject show its head (on gnomedesktop, for instance) I
see people divided on two fields, those that like the current status
quo, and those that would like to have less windows.

Just for the record, I'm one of those that want to have less windows,
and like I was quite happy with gimp 1.3.x dock system.  I've not really
look yet at the docking system @egg, but I guess that I will use this
one (even if only for the sake of sharing code).

The most conflictive item to dock will be the toplevels windows created
by the user through the palette, but I hope to also find something to
dock them.

Cheers,
