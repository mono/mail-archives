</I>
IMO adding one more widget (the dropdown) would make UI even more
painful: the user already has to go trough a lot of pointing and
clicking just to add a simple signal (as I said in another mail this
could well be one of the reasons why most of the projects prefer simply
using g_signal_connect() ).

Beside it would not work: FooHBox may have been subclassed from GtkHBox
so in the TreeView with the list of the signals you should have *both*
at the same time.

&gt;<i> We all might be programmers but if we want to make this easy for newbies
</I>&gt;<i> flooding them with GtkWindow when they might be writting Gtk.Window
</I>&gt;<i> might be confusing.  If you split them from the begining they get used
</I>&gt;<i> to the fact that Gtk is actualy seperate from Window.  Gtk is a
</I>&gt;<i> windowing toolkit package and Window is a class of that package.
</I>
It *might* be confusing... lets stick to the facts, Glade2 uses
GtkWindow since forever and I never heard a complain or a question.

Another thing to mention is the also on the first page of the Editor
&quot;Class:&quot; contains GtkWindow.


I really think we are arguing over a detail...
