Well, it's clear that we are _not_ ready for a release in the meaning of
having an usable GUI designer. On the other hand if putting a tarball
out helps to attract some attention/developers I'm all for it.

Bottom line is: I don't have a strong opnion if it's better put out a
tarball or not and feedback from more experinced people would be very
welcome. In particular it would be very appreciated if someone not
biased could check out what's in cvs and *honestly* tell us if the
impression he gets is:

* &quot;cool piece of work, but a bit immature but shows potential... I saw
this bug foobar, can you fix it?&quot;

or

* &quot;hey you told me to try it, but it sucks! I don't want to hear about
it in the next 5 years&quot;

That is, what we want to do is attract developers not scare them away.


ciao
