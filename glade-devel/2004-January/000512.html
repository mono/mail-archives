<PRE>GTK allows styles to be associated with widgets by
using gtkrc-like style files (though it can also be
coded).  Good solution.  Developers who want to create
_colorful_ childish looking applications by taking
advantage of gtk styles.  

But what worries is glade has no support for _setting_
style properties for widgets.  This can be achieved as
follows.

 * Create a seperate `properties` window OR create a
seperate _tab_ in the existing `properties` windows
that will allow one to set a list of properties
associated with GTK styles (say background color of a
button)
 * Save the style information in a seperarte `gtkrc`
file for that project which will be used during
runtime to set the style.
  OR
   Save the style information along with glade (xml)
file, after which libglade will set the style from it
during application runtime.

PS: Most of application still need such a
functionality since not all are clean looking GUI
applications, some of them are written for children
and puzzle solvers (like my college symposium team
used Visual Basic to create some puzzles with
colorfull widgets!)

Windows 2000 is more secure than Linux...
Since the machine is offline half of the time because of crashes, it cannot be accessed globally, therefore producing higher security.
