<PRE>Hey

Well the point I think John is making is certainly holds a bit of truth.
The UI names are a lot C centric where as while most of the old people might
use python/C#/ruby etc they have used C before. But some of the new league of 
programmers don't even touch C (kinda unfortuanate :(, but I myself was
suprised when it I overheard a kid say so at Gnome Summit NYC)

Also Paolo's point stands, which I state more as, &quot;&quot; I can't believe we're
arguing over such a small detail!!! &quot;&quot;. If you feel the need, submit a generic
patch (this is for John, and generic as in for most languages not just python)
:<i>-D and we'll review. until then I think none of the main guys wants to change
</I>it .. so a courteous and non-offensive :P

Cheers!
Archit Baweja

</I>&gt;<i> though.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Beside it would not work: FooHBox may have been subclassed from GtkHBox
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so in the TreeView with the list of the signals you should have *both*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at the same time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the signal TreeView you would have both (verbage is just an example):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> HBox for Gtk Signals:
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> HBox for Foo Signals:
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> as opposed to
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> GtkHBox Signals:
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> FooHBox Signals:
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; We all might be programmers but if we want to make this easy for newbies
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; flooding them with GtkWindow when they might be writting Gtk.Window
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; might be confusing.  If you split them from the begining they get used
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to the fact that Gtk is actualy seperate from Window.  Gtk is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; windowing toolkit package and Window is a class of that package.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It *might* be confusing... lets stick to the facts, Glade2 uses
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GtkWindow since forever and I never heard a complain or a question.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well we just did here a complaint from a user who programs in Python and
</I>&gt;<i> got a bit confused.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Another thing to mention is the also on the first page of the Editor
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Class:&quot; contains GtkWindow.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is where I suggested adding the Package dropdown. So 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Class: GtkWindow
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would become
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Package: Gtk \/
</I>&gt;<i> Class: Window
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not many people edit this so complexity is a moot point.  It doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> realy change anything but does make it more generic and less C binding
</I>&gt;<i> centric.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I really think we are arguing over a detail...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know if arguing is the right word.  I agree that it isn't all
</I>&gt;<i> that important but the topic was brought up so I thought I would share
</I>&gt;<i> my views.  The details are realy important however as people might not
</I>&gt;<i> rabidly complain about it but it is still a consitency issue.  Splitting
</I>&gt;<i> package and class solves that issue without adding all that much
</I>&gt;<i> complexity.  In fact I belive it clears things up for those who are not
</I>&gt;<i> part of the super C coder club (Those who can redily apply OO tequniques
</I>&gt;<i> to a procedural language :-) It also cuts down on verbosity in the
</I>&gt;<i> interface.  How many times do I have to see Gtk first when all I want is
</I>&gt;<i> a Window?  I just see it as a good middleground between having Glade
</I>&gt;<i> become language sensitive or making alternitive language programmers
</I>&gt;<i> fell like they are second class citizens.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway I don't have time to program it right now so I'm not going to
</I>&gt;<i> care much one way or another.  If somone sees my posts and says hey this
</I>&gt;<i> is a good idea and easy to do, then all the better.  At the point Glade
</I>&gt;<i> gets integrated into Scaffold and I have time I might just write a patch
</I>&gt;<i> and see how people like it :-)  So I leave it to the experts to decide
</I>&gt;<i> for now.
