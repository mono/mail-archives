As Archit already said in another mail glade-3 components (the palette,
the widget tree, etc) are implemented as separated widgets so that
should be possible with some work refactor the thing in a library for
use in separated apps... what can I say? Patches welcome!

I only wanted to add a couple of things:

1) with regard to portability glade-3 is 100% gtk+ (no gnome deps) so is
portable everywere it makes sense, ie where there is a working gtk.
AFAIK the thing should work on windows out of the box.

2) a little warning glade-3 is not much far from working properly, but
is not ready today in case you were planning of deploy your program in
short time. Of course the more patches you sent, the sooner glade-3 gets
ready :-)

I hope I managed to get you slightly interested... feel free to check
glade-3 out of cvs and give the TODO file a read.


ciao
