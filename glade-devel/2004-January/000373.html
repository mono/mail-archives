No, we don't depend in anything other than plain gtk+.  I build regularly a
windows version with MS Visual C 6.

The build processus is not exactly trivial, as we build the part that
handles the code specific to gtk+ widgets (glade-gtk.c) as a dll that calls
back some functions of the main glade (as for instance, to create a
placeholder here and there).

As I didn't managed to export the needed functions from glade-3.exe, I put
the needed functions in an internal dll, that it's used by glade-3.exe and
glade-gtk.dll.

So the easiest way to get a w32 build will probably be to just ask me for a
msvc project (I have not put it in cvs).

It should be quite easy to embed it in your project, however it's still beta
quality.

Cheers,
