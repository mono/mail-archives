I agree with a lot of this. Currently C code generation and libglade
both have issues, but both could be fixed if people were bothered.


If we had a decent IDE it wouldn't matter if it used code generation or
libglade, as the parts of the code that created the interface should be
kept pretty much out of sight.


But libglade does have 2 important advantages over code generation:

 1) It is easier to write than code generation, especially for the
    complex widgets. (Supporting the GnomeUIInfo stuff was unbearable!)

 2) Once libglade is written, it can easily be used in lots of language
    bindings.

That's why I was one of the people who suggested that code generation
wasn't included in Glade 3.
