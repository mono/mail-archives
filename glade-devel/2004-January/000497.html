</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; What do you think of an interface like that
</I>&gt;<i> one:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Hmm.. that feels unnecessarily crowded to my
</I>&gt;<i> taste.  It's 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; showing all possible signals for every widgets,
</I>&gt;<i> and yet you 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; usually only ever use one or two.  Keeping
</I>&gt;<i> signals like 'map' 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; always visible makes the dialog pretty
</I>&gt;<i> cluttered.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The plan is to make the divide the signals by its
</I>&gt;<i> class, opening only the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; topmost class. That leaves only 4-5 visible
</I>&gt;<i> signals by default.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's still a work in progress, but you can see a
</I>&gt;<i> more recent screenshot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; here:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://e98cuenc.free.fr/signals2.png">http://e98cuenc.free.fr/signals2.png</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's better, but I think it still has the same
</I>&gt;<i> problem.  (I was
</I>&gt;<i> actually thinking you should show the widget class
</I>&gt;<i> as header even if you
</I>&gt;<i> did show just the signals that have handlers.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The basic problem with having all the signals in the
</I>&gt;<i> same tree is that
</I>&gt;<i> you're repeating useless information (&lt;Type signal
</I>&gt;<i> handler here&gt;) over
</I>&gt;<i> and over again, making the relevant information
</I>&gt;<i> (which signals actually
</I>&gt;<i> have handlers) more difficult to find.
</I>
Of course, with the current mock-up the &lt;Type signal
handler here&gt; is too inconvenient.  I was thinking
that I should display it on a light gray, and probably
don't display it at all if there are no signals
handlers attached to a signal (leaving it just as a
clue to people that want to add several signal
handlers to the same signal).

More or less like this:

Signal          Handler               After
v GtkButton
  v pressed     on_press_button       []
                &lt;Type signal...&gt;      []
  &gt; released    on_release_button     []
    clicked                           []
    enter                             []
    leave                             []
&gt;<i> GtkContainer                        []
</I>&gt;<i> GtkWidget                           []
</I>&gt;<i> GtkObject                           []
</I>
Another idea that I want to test would be to mark
connected signals in bold, but I fear too much
&quot;colors&quot; in the same window (some signal handlers
bold, other signals normal + maybe some &lt;Type...&gt; in
light gray).

&gt;<i>  You can't be
</I>&gt;<i> certain which
</I>&gt;<i> signals have handlers unless you expand all classes
</I>&gt;<i> and scroll the list
</I>&gt;<i> around.
</I>
Good point.  Alternatives are:

1) to expand all the classes with signals that have
handlers by default + always expand the top-most
class.

2) to show in bold the classes that have at least a
signal with a handler.

I prefer alternative 1.  For a casual user, it just
means to expand the top-most class, and users with
handlers down in the hierarchie will be able to see
them at a glance.  But I have to see it in live to
take a decision.

&gt;<i> The added benefit is that you are saving one click
</I>&gt;<i> when adding a signal
</I>&gt;<i> from the topmost class, but that's all.  Adding a
</I>&gt;<i> signal from ancestors
</I>&gt;<i> requires you to expand the class first, no help
</I>&gt;<i> there.
</I>
I don't follow you, here.  We're saving one click
relative to what UI?

&gt;<i> I don't think adding a signal from the topmost class
</I>&gt;<i> is that often used
</I>&gt;<i> that you need to optimize away one click, making
</I>&gt;<i> other things harder in
</I>&gt;<i> the process.
</I>
Again, I'm lost.  We're making things harder relative
to what?

Btw, I think that adding a signal to the topmost class
is the most used operation on the signal's dialog.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Can anyone make an educated guess whether or not
</I>&gt;<i> the ability 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to add multiple handlers for the same signal is
</I>&gt;<i> actually used 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; in practice? 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; It's obviously making the UI more complicated,
</I>&gt;<i> but is the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; feature useful enough to warrant that, I don't
</I>&gt;<i> really know...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm still not sure that it will make the UI more
</I>&gt;<i> complicated. There are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; several ways to leave multiple handlers per
</I>&gt;<i> signal, and still share the same
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; UI with the &quot;only 1 handler per signal&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> alternative.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For instance, you can say that the handler is
</I>&gt;<i> instead a comma separated list
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of handlers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Showing more information pretty much always results
</I>&gt;<i> in more complex UI. 
</I>&gt;<i> There are degrees of complexity, though...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Comma separated list would be hard to discover,
</I>
But it will not interfer with those using the dialog
box as if it was only possible to have one handler per
signal.

It was just an example of a way to handle this problem
that doesn't makes life harder to those using it with
only a handler per signal.  The &quot;hard to discover&quot;
problem is why I'm experimenting with &lt;Type...&gt; labels
instead.

&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> to see all handlers
</I>&gt;<i> for a signal you'd either need to scroll
</I>&gt;<i> horizontally (even worse than
</I>&gt;<i> vertical scrolling) or have quite a wide window.
</I>
True, but it will not penalize
&quot;one-handler-per-signal&quot; users.  Thus we can still
have several handlers per signal, without complicating
the common only one handler per signal use-case.

Again, I'm not favoring the comma separated handlers
approach, it was just an example.

Cheers,
