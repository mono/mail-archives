AFAIR, I was just wondering if they were need for
accessibility and discoveribility.  Later I though
that adding the &lt;Type...&gt; label makes editing in place
so easy to discover as with a button.

I've got no feedback from the accesibility guys, but
even with a button, you have to browse a tree view in
the dialog that opens with all the signals, and in
place editing has been used before.  So I guess that
accesibility wise it's ok.

</I>
So, in short, the issues are:

* discoverability
* accesibility
* familiarity
* shows more information than need

As I said, I think discoverability got addressed with
the &lt;Type...&gt; label, even if it's yet a bit too
visible.  I'm playing with several alternatives to
make the label less ubiquious, and yet make it easy to
see where can you type the handler.

Accesibility wise, I think we're ok, but I'm ready to
be proved wrong :-)

For the familiarity, in place editing is used in any
RAD tool I can think of, and the concept has been with
us for a long time across any OS.  We're also
targetting developers, which are usually a bit more
computer savvy than the mean.  So I don't think that
any glade user can honestly say that he had problems
grasping the concept.

The &quot;shows more information than need&quot; problem is only
real if you define the &quot;need&quot; as remove/modify
handlers.  As soon as you add the &quot;add&quot; a new handler
operation, then the dialog shows just the information
you need.

So I guess the question is if easing the adding of a
new signal handler is worth the space taken by the
signals without handlers + the unused classes.  In my
opinion, yes, it is, as there is indeed a very little
number of signals on a widget (usually 5-6) and you
will rarely use a signal on a parent class (usually
people connect to &quot;pressed&quot; signals and such).

And I don't consider a list of 5-6 signals to be a
problem at all when you're looking for your signal :-)

&gt;<i> I'd argue the most used operation is to see what
</I>&gt;<i> signals already have
</I>&gt;<i> handlers.  Before you add a handler you probably
</I>&gt;<i> take at least a cursory
</I>&gt;<i> glance to see that the handler isn't already there. 
</I>&gt;<i> With new widgets
</I>&gt;<i> you'll probably skip that step, but the longer the
</I>&gt;<i> widget has been in
</I>&gt;<i> the model, the more likely I think you need to
</I>&gt;<i> refresh your memory.
</I>
You can see if your signal has a handler at a glance. 
If you're going to take that as an &quot;operation&quot;, then
the new design also frees the user from 1 additional
search when adding a new handler, as with the old
design you should first see if your signal has a
handler, and then search your signal in the dialog
box.

But again, the first search is just a glance, you see
clearly what are the signals with a handler as those
without a handler have the &lt;Type...&gt; label with a
different colour (gray instead of black).  We can put
the signals with a handler in bold to make it still
clearer, though.

Thank you for your comments!

Cheers,
