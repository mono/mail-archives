I find it natural too and I'm all for it, just I'd like it not to be the
*only* way to remove a signal handler. Two reasons mainly:

1) discoverabilty: I expect that when you select a row to add an hadler,
the &quot;handler&quot; cell switch immediatly to edit mode so that it's clear you
should type the function name, but when you select a row which already
has an handler name I'd expect it to simply be selected and to switch to
edit mode only if you click again on the cell.

2) ease/rapidity of use: when you add a handler you have to type the
function name anyway, but to remove one it would be nice to just have to
click a button and/or press the DEL key instead of deleting the function
name character by character.


&gt;<i> We should anyway show the handler's names in the tree
</I>&gt;<i> view, maybe as Archit suggests making the signal's
</I>&gt;<i> name the parent of handler's names on the tree.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then we can have a &quot;&lt;Type your signal handler name&gt;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> that will add a new handler when the user types the
</I>&gt;<i> name of the handler.  Something like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Name             Handler          After
</I>&gt;<i> =======================================
</I>&gt;<i> - Activate       
</I>&gt;<i>    |______       on_activate1      [x]
</I>&gt;<i>    |______       on_activate2      [ ]
</I>&gt;<i>    |______       &lt;Type your ...&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> + Realize
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I generally like this solution too, note however that we end up with a
three level tree, since signals are also grouped by class. That could
make things slightly more painful. Maybe the nodes containg the signal
name should be expanded by default.

&gt;<i> The disavantage of this method is that you have to
</I>&gt;<i> expand the signal before being able to add a signal
</I>&gt;<i> handler.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I also don't know if it has accesibility problems.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll consult the usability folks on this issue.
</I>
Agreed, some advice by the &quot;expertsÂ£ would be great, especially because
there aren't many examples of this kind of UI in gnome
