</I>Hi Tim,

Sorry for not replying to your earlier post.  Before applying a patch 
like this, I'd want to get some agreement on what subset of XML we 
should support.

GMarkupParser only accepts a small subset of valid XML files.  Is that 
subset good enough?  Some of the things not supported include:

    * files in encodings other than UTF-8
    * entities other than &amp;gt;, &amp;lt; and &amp;amp;
    * anything related to DTDs ...

What limitations do other glade file consumers have?  What features do 
glade file producers produce?

Libglade doesn't currently do all the processing it could (eg. 
processing of the internal DTD subset, and expanding custom entities, 
which some people have asked for), so I am not opposed to defining a 
subset that glade files need to conform to in order to interoperate.

I just don't want to end up defining this subset as &quot;what libglade accepts&quot;.

James.
