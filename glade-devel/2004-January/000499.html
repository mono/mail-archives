<PRE>Hmm, I had thought it was already discussed that having Add and Remove
buttons is mandatory, for accessibility and discoveribility.  I guess I
misread something.

Anyway, based on that assumption I was thinking about simple and
straightforward transformation of the old dialog.  Get rid of the
entries and buttons except for 'Remove' and change the '...' to 'Add'. 

Clicking Add would show the existing dialog from which you just pick the
signal.  Selecting OK will add the signal in the treeview, and begin
editing the handler name in place.  Pretty much like the following. 
(Buttons are just to show the required elements, their actual placement
is open.)


Signal          Handler                After
GtkButton
  clicked       on_add_clicked         [ ]
  clicked       on_add_clicked_after   [X]
GtkWidget
  map           on_add_map             [ ]
  unmap        [                     ] [ ]
--------------------------------------------
[Add] [Remove]


The above should be clean, and show all and only the relevant
information.  Also the use of normal buttons should be familiar for
everyone.

It is slightly slower than your mockup since you need to go through the
dialog (three clicks, always) instead of just clicking on the treeview
directly (one click, best case.)  I just don't believe adding a signal
is done often enough that saving the two clicks compensates enough for
the issues I've mentioned.

(Actually two clicks, see above.  My mistake.)  The current one, or I
think anything that only shows signals with handlers in the treeview.

</I>
I'd argue the most used operation is to see what signals already have
handlers.  Before you add a handler you probably take at least a cursory
glance to see that the handler isn't already there.  With new widgets
you'll probably skip that step, but the longer the widget has been in
the model, the more likely I think you need to refresh your memory.

We can, of course, agree to disagree on the matter. :)
