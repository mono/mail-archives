The thought had crossed my mind.  Removing it from the core of the
application is a good rearchitecting decision, but I don't entirely
approve of &quot;code generation is evil, don't do it&quot; mantra chanting.  If
there's something wrong with the code it generates, fix it, don't delete
the generator.  There's ALWAYS something wrong with the generated code.
What is gcc besides a giant (machine) code generator?  I don't think you
can find anybody who will try to claim gcc-generated code is always
perfect.  The imperfection of machine-generated code is hardly sufficient
grounds for eradicating it.  I don't consider the development cycle or
overwrite error arguments sufficient either.  All three arguments apply to
specific circumstances and none of them apply to all circumstances.
