<PRE>The way I see it from a Scaffold point of view.  Glade itself can be
mostly autonimous at least for the first itegration attempts.  All that
is realy needed in an API is the ability to load and save a glade file,
and signals to notify when a callback is created or renamed.  Also some
signals for other property changes might be useful.  Dialogs need to
become self contained widgets which seems to have happened from what I
read and there needs to be a canvas in order to build the GUI.  

Right now Glade popus up a dialog or application window where a person
can place his or her widgets.  This works in a standalone application
but in Scaffold it would be nice to have that integrated as one of the
document tabs.  This is so Scaffold can keep track of what document is
being edited.  When the user switches to the glade canvas, the embeded
glade dialog tools pop up in Scaffold's layout and then dissapear when
another non glade document is selected for editing.

Future version would allow for the application to expand the UI such as
putting a &quot;jump to callback&quot; button where callbacks are defined.  Much
of this future work can perhaps integrate with Scaffold's interfaces so
as to cut down on the duplication of work.  Glade-3 aims to be a
pluggable component and Scaffold aims to be the container for pluggable
components.  

Just a thought.

I CC'ed this to the dev tools list to see what others think.
