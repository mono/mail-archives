Well I didn't say stripping it.  I was more of the opinion of seperating
it. So you have a dropdown list of packages to choose from and then a
lookahead textbox that can predict what class you want from that
package.  Archit's example on the tooltips &quot;Window for GtkWindow&quot; would
just as simply be written &quot;Window for Gtk&quot;.  Less verbose and keeps the
meaning.  

We all might be programmers but if we want to make this easy for newbies
flooding them with GtkWindow when they might be writting Gtk.Window
might be confusing.  If you split them from the begining they get used
to the fact that Gtk is actualy seperate from Window.  Gtk is a
windowing toolkit package and Window is a class of that package.
