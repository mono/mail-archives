yeah :-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I sent it to Damon asking to including it in glade.gnome.org; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; probably he hasn't had the time to look at it yet. Anyway I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; also attaching it here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The thing about runtime-pluggable extensions for extra widgets doesn't sound

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I don't know the glade-2 internals very well too, but I think it's a bit
different, as a matter of fact the gnome and gnomedb extensions are part
of the glade-2 codebase.

I have the impression that these additional widgets are included at
compile time (but I'm not sure).

With glade-3 what you have to do to add a &quot;catalog&quot; is simply specify
the list of widgets (and some of their properties) in an xml file and
implement the function to set/get the overridden properties in a shared
object. The GObject system will figure out the rest for you: for example
the implementation of the whole standard gtk+ catalog is simply the
glade-gtk.c file and the xml files in the widgets direcory. IIRC in
glade-2 you have to code up a file for _each_ widget.


&gt;<i> If nobody steps us to help with TODO items, it might help to suggested where
</I>&gt;<i> in the code people might start hacking. Is the menu editing just a bit
</I>&gt;<i> broken or does it need a complete rewrite?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Yeah I've thought about adding a &quot;filemap&quot; file somewhere to help people
orient in the code... just never got around to do it. Beside looking at
the main structures in the .h files is pretty easy to figure out who
does what (they are heavily commented). Asking on the list or on IRC for
a starting point is probably the best thing.

WRT the menu editor: it was ported from glade-2 and it's mostly broken.
A rewrite with a better UI design would be good, but short term
unbreaking it would suffice.
Archit had a new version (unfortunately somewhere in India). 
Anyway the real thing that needs figuring out is the backend, ie how to
generate the xml stuff for the menus and find out which menu properties
must be overridden.

It would also be good to know what role the new Gtk2.4 menu/action stuff
play wrt to glade/libglade...


&gt;<i> &gt; As for the tarball, I also agree that we should put out one 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (marking really clear that it is alpha quality) at least to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make some noise. Last time I asked Joaquin, he preferred to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wait that some of the remaining issues are be fixed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It intalls in parallel with glade-2 so I don't think it's any problem if
</I>&gt;<i> it's useless. By making a release you show more people that it needs their
</I>&gt;<i> help and you show more people that it's near-enough finished that their help
</I>&gt;<i> can take it that last few steps to being usable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Agreed, but last word to Joaquin who is the current maintainer.
