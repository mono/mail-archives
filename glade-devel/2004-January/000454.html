I'm also contrary to the idea of having this option to switch the name,
not only because I'm darn lazy and I don't like unnecessary code, but
also because glade3 should be language-agnostic and just have a univoc
name for each widget and GtkHBox is the best candidate since it's the
original one. Maybe that kind of renaming can be done in the IDE that
embeds glade3 by subclassing the signal-editor, since the ide knows in
which language the project will be developed.
Note however that I wouldn't suggest it since the UI of the GUI designer
would be changing for each project.

I also don't like the idea of stripping of the Gtk* namespace, since you
could have a loadable library that offers its FooHBox or whatever.
IMHO glade is the _GTK_ gui builder, so calling the Gtk widgets with
their name (GtkHBox etc) is just fine.
