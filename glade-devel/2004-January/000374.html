I forgot to say that there are still some issues that are specific to the
win32 that I've not yet managed to fix.

Previous win32 specific issues where due to code with not defined behaviour,
so maybe these issues are not the fault of gtk+-win (but I think they are).

The issues are that the mouse cursor don't changes to an arrow with a '+'
when you're over a placeholder (well, only when you're more or less in the
upper half of the placeholder), spinbuttons are completely broken.  When you
try to change a numeric property with them, it switchs inmediately to 0.
And I didn't managed to find a w32 popt dll, so the command line doesn't
accept arguments.

&gt;<i> As I didn't managed to export the needed functions from 
</I>&gt;<i> glade-3.exe, I put the needed functions in an internal dll, 
</I>&gt;<i> that it's used by glade-3.exe and glade-gtk.dll.
</I>
Glade-3.exe is very light wrapper around the internal dll (only in main.c).
You may want to take a look if you want to embed the glade-3 core in another
app.

Cheers,
