Maybe, but it isn't what I was talking about. As a matter of fact the
problem I was pointing out is not related to your patch at all, it is
just in the same function you are modifying.

What I was talking about is a memory management problem: in that
function (even before your patch) the GtkTreeIter structure is allocated
but never freed, so the memory it takes is leaked.
The short way is add a g_free (parent) before the function end.
The long way is rework the api so that the iter is a simple local
variable instead of pointer allocated with g_new0, since this is similar
to how GtkTreeIter are used usually in gtk.

&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; g_return_if_fail *are* asserts made exactly for this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use; when they fail
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they print a critical message on the console and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then return so that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; function is not executed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    But without the above two g_assert statements, the
</I>&gt;<i> statement
</I>&gt;<i>    g_return_if_fail (editor-&gt;class-&gt;signals);
</I>&gt;<i>   _will_ cause segfault, if either `editor` or `class`
</I>&gt;<i> is NULL!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I meant you should add
 g_return_if_fail (editor);
 g_return_if_fail (editor-&gt;class);
instead of the asserts.

Anyway both the asserts and the g_return_if_fails are just sanity checks
that get triggered when something is wrong. If the program segfaults
because of a pointer gone wild, we have to track down *why* it happens
and fix it, not just fix the symptoms.
