<PRE>Hey

Well I don't know what he meant, but in glade-3, there will be no code 
generation by default. It just spits out xml, thats all. No builtin support for
C code. Some people might argue why C, why not ruby, c++ and thats one of the
reasons (but not the main, useful one). Make it do one thing, generate XML
files representing a UI, and one thing good :D. 

Code generators are supposed to be separate. And if I'm not
wrong, there was a C generator in glade 1 days, despite there being a builtin
C generator. So someone can hopefully revive that project if they want regular
C sources in glade-3 :-D. Also as one can see source generation is only useful
for newbies so they can learn a bit by reading the source. But I don't think
that it is a good thing since we also tell newbies to use libglade (which I 
believe is better). Anyway on a personal note, I really despise the code
generated by the builtin C generator in glade-1 and glade-2.

For source generation I program driven by a simple to meduim complexity XSL
stylesheet should be good enough to generate output. I don't know the full
details on this method, but I know it can be done. If this works we could just
have xslt stylesheets for various languages with the small program in one
module (called something like glade2x or something :-) )

Conclusion:
Glade3 will not have source code generation builtin. Those who want that must
start the process of reviving old code generation projects for their
favourite languages (C, C++, Perl, Ruby, Java, Python).

Hope that helps in clearing out some confusion.
