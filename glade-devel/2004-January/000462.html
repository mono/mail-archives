<PRE>I have been building some forms using Glade. I am using the Tab and
Shift-Tab keys to move the cursor from Left-to-Right between fields. I
wanted to use the UP and Down Arrow Keys to move the cursor between fields
in an Up-and-Down direction. 

This will allow the user to move the cursor to a field at the bottom of the
screen quickly by using the down arrow key, instead of having to hit the
Tab key a lot more times while traversing through all of the fields to
finally get to the bottom of the form.

Everything works great unitl you hit a &quot;ComboBox&quot; object. I would like to
modify the callbacks so that a user would have to press the &quot;ALT&quot; key and
the UP and Down Arrow keys to change the contents of the ComboBox. If the
&quot;ALT&quot; key was not pressed. Then the use of the Arrow Keys would simply move
the Cursor to the Field above or the Field below the ComboBox field. 

Would anybody please help me figure out how to modify 'Glade' or configure
it so that the ComboBox would have this behavior.

BTW -- I would like to thank everyone who have contributed to Glades
development. 

Thank you,

GK
