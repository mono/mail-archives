</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please find attached a patch that moves loading of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; library module before the call to foo_get_type() that's 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; supposedly in that library. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; With the patch I was able to get custom widgets to appear in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; glade palette.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for the patch, but unfortunately it's not correct (even if you're
</I>&gt;<i> right when you say that without it custom widgets don't work).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;library&quot; variable refers to the name of the library that contains the
</I>&gt;<i> special functions that may be needed by glade-3 to handle specially some of
</I>&gt;<i> the widgets contained in the real library.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let me explain it with an example.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let's say that you want to add support for a library that contains a widget
</I>&gt;<i> named foo.  We will call this library libfoo.so.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you're lucky, you should be able to add support for this library just
</I>&gt;<i> adding an entry to glade-palette.xml and gtk-base.xml or gtk-additional.xml
</I>&gt;<i> (or eventually another special xml file, let's say gtk-foo-catalog.xml).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you need some light customization of the handling of this widget by
</I>&gt;<i> glade-3, you can do it with an special xml file that will be indicated in
</I>&gt;<i> gtk-foo-catalog.xml. One example will be to ignore some property in
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;edition&quot; mode, like &quot;visibility&quot; (however you don't need to handle
</I>&gt;<i> specially &quot;visibility&quot; as it's already done in gtkwidget.xml, and these
</I>&gt;<i> things inherite).  Another example will be to change the default value of
</I>&gt;<i> some properties, when you can't change it in the widget itself (for example,
</I>&gt;<i> because you want to retain backward compatibility).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And, in the worst of cases, you will need to add special code to handle your
</I>&gt;<i> widget (usually neccesary, but not limited to, containers, for instance, as
</I>&gt;<i> you have to add programatically some placeholders here and there).  That
</I>&gt;<i> special code should go in a special library, with a name derived from the
</I>&gt;<i> name specified in the &quot;library&quot; attribute of your GladeCatalog (it should be
</I>&gt;<i> named &quot;libglade&quot; + library attribute, and it should go in the MODULES
</I>&gt;<i> directory of glade-3). It our case it may be libgladefoo.so.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's the library that it's loaded by g_module_open in the code that you
</I>&gt;<i> move with your patch, and it's unrelated to the library that contains the
</I>&gt;<i> real Foo widget.
</I>
Intriguing, knew all that but never bothered to comprehend it all in on gigantic piece. Nice :-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As you see, there's a missing piece, and it's the code that loads the
</I>&gt;<i> library that contains the Foo widget, as you need it to call the
</I>&gt;<i> foo_get_type function. That is, AFAIR, the only missing thing to make the
</I>&gt;<i> plugable widgets really work.
</I>
That is already done! Why that was infact my first patch to glade-3 (back when
it was still called glade-2) :D. You can take a look in glade-widget-class.c
There is some code like, glade_widget_class_get_get_type_func or something.
Tommi... wanna take a shot at it :D

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you can cook a patch to load that library, it will be great.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was thinking about having a special attribute in GladeCatalog to indicate
</I>&gt;<i> the name of the &quot;main&quot; library (libfoo.so), and not reusing the &quot;library&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> attribute for both libraries.
</I>
Cheers!
