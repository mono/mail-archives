I think for large projects with multiple developers libglade is probably
a better idea (though I think you can work around the problems with
generated code if you need to).

But for small projects I don't think it really matters too much. Lots of
people have built apps using generated code.

One current advantage of generated code is that you can just click on
'Build' and you get a complete app ready to compile and run.


There are also other issues with libglade that need resolving:

 o libglade works best if you keep each window in a separate XML file,
   but Glade is currently oriented to keeping all windows in one file.
   (Glade-3 is probably the same.)

 o signal connection, which I just mentioned in another mail.
   This has to be done automatically to be used in a decent IDE,
   where you will also be able to type in signal handler code.
   Why did you suggest doing it manually, Paolo?

 o I'm still not quite sure about memory management issues in libglade.
   e.g. the glade_xml_new() docs say that the parse tree is cached,
   and indeed the GladeInterface is kept around. But I can't see where
   that is reused. Where is that code? Is it possible to clear the
   cache?

   Also, if I call glade_xml_new() with no root node, does that mean
   that one instance of every window is created. That could lead to
   wasted resources, since many windows may not be needed.
