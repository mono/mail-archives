I would not say that it is the *main* difference (it's a rewrite after
all! ;-), but for the casual end user that used to rely on code
generation is one of the noticeable changes.

Note however that generating code is a _bad_ idea also with the current
glade-2 and it is strongly discouraged.
As a matter of fact the lack of code generation has nothing to do with
glade.3 per se; simply when glade-3 was being designed everybody agreed
that was such a bad idea that it was better leave it out from the start.

For example see this discussion:
<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/glade-devel/2003-February/000015.html">http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/glade-devel/2003-February/000015.html</A>


&gt;<i>From your question I think to understand that you are not very familiar
</I>with libglade. I suggest that you take a closer look to it and probably
use it in your own application.

Using libglade there is no need to generate any .c file. Glade-3 simply
creates the xml file ( .glade ).

It's up to the user load it where it fits best in his application, and
in whichever programming language he prefers.
