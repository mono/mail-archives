<PRE>Mono already powers over 100+ games on the AppStore via Unity 3D I believe.

Also there are several alternate development toolkits out there (not nearly as powerful as Mono) that also have apps on the AppStore.

It's just a matter of people are still building MonoTouch based apps because of its infancy.

Thanks!
Simon

Subject: Re: [MonoTouch] Does anyone have an approved app in the app store?

So is that because Monotouch hasn't been out long enough to get an app through the approval process or are people running into problems getting their apps past Apple?  I would really like to do some work with Monotouch but I can't justify the expense and the effort until I know these apps can make it into the store.  Apple has rejected apps for so many reasons.  It wouldn't surprise me to have them reject an app because it was not created solely with their toolkit.

Does anyone have an approved app in the app store yet?  If so, was there any problem getting it approved?  If somebody has already made a list, please point me at it.

Thanks...
