<PRE>Hi,

These are the issues I have encountered in the last few days, hopefully some of them have simple fixes.

1. why does IB loose all my outlets on some of the view controllers, there was one in particular where it did not matter what order I did things if I created a few outlets and then saved the information, closed IB, reopened IB the outlets were missing every time, I ended up having to create the view controller from scratch to fix the issue.

2. why can't IB rename outlets properly, I have seen a couple of different things happen, firstly where the .designer.cs does not get updated, so manual changes in there were required, another issue was if you delete something with an outlet attached then add something and want to create an outlet with the same name, sometimes it fails and other times it creates two references in the .h file.

3. why can't all references to a removed file e.g. an image file be found without having to search through the files, the build of the project works, and even runs on the simulator but not on a physical device.

4. why can I build and run in the simulator an application but when it is run on the physical device I get errors like 

-[UIBarButtonItem UTF8String]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x421c450

these errors don't occur on the simulator.

5. using the tab bar out of the app delegate

e.g. at the class level

ReviseVCiPhone _tbRevise;
OpenBikeListsVCiPhone _tbBikeLists;
UINavigationController [] _navigationRoots;
UITabBarController _tbController;

inside finished launching

_tbController = new UITabBarController();
_tbRevise = new ReviseVCiPhone(&quot;Revise&quot;);
_tbBikeLists = new OpenBikeListsVCiPhone(&quot;Open Bike Lists&quot;);

_tbRevise.TabBarItem = new UITabBarItem(&quot;Revise&quot;, UIImage.FromBundle(&quot;Images/Toolbar/Revise.png&quot;), 0);
_tbBikeLists.TabBarItem = new UITabBarItem(&quot;Bike Lists&quot;, UIImage.FromBundle(&quot;Images/Toolbar/Bike.png&quot;),1);

_navigationRoots = new UINavigationController [5] {
	new UINavigationController (_tbRevise) {
		TabBarItem = (UITabBarItem)_tbRevise.TabBarItem,
	} ,
	new UINavigationController (_tbBikeLists) {
		TabBarItem = (UITabBarItem)_tbBikeLists.TabBarItem,
	} 
}

_tbController.SetViewControllers(_navigationRoots, false);				
_window.RootViewController = _tbController;

navigating seems to work fine if I go into the root view controllers, then from them into other view controllers, but once I then go 3 levels deep I get GC errors on the root view controllers, this problem is fixed if I do something like the following in the button click on the third level view controllers

ViewBikeListVCiPhone _viewBikeList = new ViewBikeListVCiPhone(_prevision_set,_description); this.NavigationController.PushViewController(_viewBikeList, false);

surely this is not right, because if you set animate to true you are going forward not backwards if that makes sense.

all of the above issues could be my lack of understanding of how things are meant to be done.

thanks for looking

ATB

Alex
