<PRE>This is just an update - was first submitted about a year ago. Like yours, this one is too specific for them to run it (unless they used to be a Valet).

Only took about 6 hours to go from submitted to in review, but it's been in review for 2 days, and they've not logged in to actually look at anything. Just starting to get worried about what they *are* looking at.

Subject: Re: [MonoTouch] How long can &quot;In Review&quot; take?

as far as I know, the app review process is completely, utterly opaque.  Produce Development is a sieve compared to the inner workings of the app review process

if this is your first submission of an app, it wouldn't surprise me if it took longer, but that's based on no real data at all.  My past experience with a semi-complex biz app was that it took 2-3 days to get reviewed, and then the review itself was less than a day.  My gut instinct is also that they don't actually review every single feature of an app - mine was too domain specific for someone with no knowledge to really dig into, and they never asked for any guidance during the review process

Our app went to &quot;in Review&quot; Monday afternoon. It's now Wednesday morning.

Now, the app isn't simple - has about 90 view controllers (not counting dynamic dialogs). But I know for a fact that they haven't even logged in, nor have they requested a new password. So at best - they have seen 3 view controllers. A login view, a support view, and a request password view.

Is 3 or 4 hours per view controller normal? Or has someone started reviewing it and forgotten?
