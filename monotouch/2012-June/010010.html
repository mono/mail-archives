Just to comment on this.  Hope I'm not too late to the party.  

The book was finished in April, 2010 and shipped around the end of June, 2010.  IIRC, we used MD 2.4 and MT 2.x.
The book contains support for the iPad.  I love Craig Dunn for digging in and doing a great job there!!!!!

The content from the book still runs as is, except for a root view controller message.  Almost everything is accurate and still works as is.

There are 4 MT books that I am aware of.  These are mine/ours, Mike Bluestein, Bryan Costanich, and Dmitris' book.  IIRC Dmitris' book has a chapter on it.

I always want to take a moment to thank Craig and Chris Hardy for their work on the book.  They deserve most of the credit for the success of the book.  Both now work for Xamarin. I feel like I was just the pretty face of the book.  

Wally

Unfortunately this is what happens with reasonablly new products, they change shape frequently as they mature, I have been frustrated with the samples or the lack of with the current version of MT and MT.D, I am sure with time we will get some up to date samples. I remember the the version 1 release of .net and the quantity of changes in the next version.
IMHO, when a new version of something is released samples showing the new features and changes should be released at the same time.

there are at least 4 books available - Wally's is the oldest (I believe it predates the iPad, as well as the complete redesign of XCode) and both iOS and MT have changed a lot since then.

the &quot;root view controller&quot; issue is related to a change Apple made is iOS 5.  See this

Pardon my ignorance on some of this. I'm new to Monotouch &amp; C#, but I'll push

my way through anyway.



In my test I was trying to build and run the app in debug mode.



I was getting a non-fatal build-time error, but the app did make it to the

iPhone simulator.  When I would try and move the picker dial, I would get an

immediate crash.  If I then would try to run the app directly from the

simulator, it would work fine.



Your 3 line modification does fix the runtime error, so we must be looking

at the same problem.



However, I'm still getting a non-fatal build time error:



PickerView01[25059:1507] Application windows are expected to have a root

view controller at the end of application launch.



How do I get rid of it (not sure what it's talking about)?



The funny thing is that by flailing about, I too was able to get the

original code to run.  Specifically, I went into the Xcode designer and

created a dummy Outlet and then I deleted it.  This forced Monodevelop to

build a more robust version of MainWindow.xib.designer.cs.



I don't know what any of this means, but I think books are really important.

So if it were up to me, I would fix MT/MD so it's compatible with the book

instead of vice versa.  I don't think there are too many books out there.

Is there a better one than the one by McClure et al.?



BTW, is the original C# in the book valid or not?   And what is a &quot;GC&quot;?

Thanks in advance for your feedback and time.
