<PRE>Rolf Bjarne Kvinge to the rescue again, that did clear some things up... I
was somehow under the impression that iOS would just randomly reclaim memory
from the app while it was sleeping - that DidReceiveMemoryWarning was only
called while the app was in the foreground. Silly me. 

Many of the objects I keep in memory are for performance reasons, and while
I could always free them when the app enters background I'd probably have to
restore then when the user returns, which would make for a noticeable delay.
I'll just free them in DidReceiveMemoryWarning then. Finally things are
starting to fall into place, this is much easier than believing that iOS
would just randomly butcher parts of your app, super thanks!

... that does leave the seemingly random freezes as something of a mystery,
but I'll probably figure that out with your debugging tips. Cool!
