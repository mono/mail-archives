<PRE>Hello and greetings. 

I am having some problems with a module which I&#8217;ll explain in details. I am
working on an iPhone app which is communicating to an sql server database
through web services. When a user logs in by providing credentials, a
webmethod returns all the relevant data relating to that client in the form
of an xml which I am serializing and writing to a location in the Personal
folder. Upon successful authentication, he is redirected to another screen
where some data relating to his projects will be shown in an UITableView.
This comes later. First I want that when he is redirected to the home screen
[called AssessmentsHome] a sqlite database file will be created at runtime
and the data that was being returned by the webmethod be inserted into a
table called ClientInfo. I have written the code but as it stands it is not
working as desired. Upon authentication, it is showing a welcome message
with the name of the client and then entering the exception block where it&#8217;s
showing a custom message. I am completely a newbie in terms of Sqlite
application integration, this being my maiden attempt. Initially I thought
it might be due to some missing references. So I added Mono.Data.Sqlite and
Mono.Data.Tds, but still no improvement. I created a class called
DBHandler.cs where I have put all my database related codes. Since I am
using an evaluation version of MonoTouch I cannot use the debugger to
pinpoint the source of error. 

Here is the code snippet for the flow of operations that are happening on
clicking the login button on login screen.




Here is the code snippet from the AssessmentHome screen where I am trying to
create the database at runtime and insert the data by calling the
appropriate method from DBHandler class. 



Here is the entire code block from the DBhandler class where I have written
the database centric member functions. The critical point is that I cannot
see any database file being created anywhere in my folders structure. I am
using the Sqlite version 3.7.1 that is available as an add-on with Firefox.
Hope I have been able to help you guys understand the scenario. I need some
help with this module as it means a lot to me. I have only started exploring
the world of ios App development and as such have lot of queries and doubts.
That&#8217;s why I resorted to seeking help from this forum.
