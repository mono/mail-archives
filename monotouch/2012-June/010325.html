<PRE>&gt;<i> 1. What is the best way of testing against previous IOS versions, ie. revert
</I>&gt;<i> to previous IOS on device, xCode versions side-by-side (any issues?), etc...
</I>
You can't, basically. I have an old iPod Touch on 4.2 for &quot;old&quot;
testing, an iPad2, and my iPhone 4S for &quot;new testing&quot;. I should have
kept a iphone 4 for single core testing. I also have an iPod Touch
4gen (which is single core) for iOS6 testing.

Apple, however, will only EVER accept a binary built with the current
version of xcode, so no point or reason going back in XCode versions.
And they also never accept beta versions (ie, the current 4.5 one for
iOS6)

Get rid of beta versions of MonoTouch and use the stable one, unless
you have a reason not to. MT builds are usually very good, but for an
appstore release, stable is usually better in my experience.

&gt;<i> 2. What is the lowest version I should currently test against
</I>
Depends on your app. I go with iOS4.2 (which is the newest one that a
3G will run - hence my old iPod Touch is a 3G equivilent - about 50
quid off ebay :) ). But I'm shortly going to stop doing that for new
apps and go with iOS5.

With earnest, I went with functional in iOS4.2, and properly working
in iOS5+ (ie, full graphics, not just tintcolor etc)

Depends on what you can get your hands on, and who you want to target.
iOS 4.2 gets you around 98% of all devices out there. iOS5 gets you
around 90% I think.

&gt;<i> 3. Other than the standard guidelines and startup time, what &quot;gotchas&quot; would
</I>&gt;<i> anyone like to share?
</I>
test. test. test again. If you happen to discover a bad bug, pull the
app from review (unless they are actively reviewing it, ie, it's been
5 working days +), and resubmit. If it's just an edge case or not
causing data loss, prepare a .1 release right after.

I'm not sure what &quot;large scale&quot; release is on the appstore. Last year,
I did around 9 major releases (lots of stuff added) to mobileAgent, so
far, without problem.

Upgrades can be fun, but you are not there yet. Always start with the
old version, put data in, install your new one (eg with TestFlight)
and then see what happens. You really dont want people upgrading and
losing their data!!

Same goes for using the app when it's clean. Delete the app.
reinstall. make sure that works.

Try it with airplane mode on.
Try it with wifi only
Try it on a bus or underground, esp when you go from signal to none
and back to signal. (assuming it does network stuff)
try it on GPRS if you can (the little dot, not 3G or E). Failing that,
get a proxy like Charles, pipe all your data thru that, and crank the
connection speed down to 56k. or less.

Basically, think of as many ways as possible that the app could fail,
and poke and prod it until it does (or doesn't)
