Getting code signing errors :(


in the past I've occasionally had to delete everything from XCode and 
Keychain and then re-download them all


there is a probably a better way to handle it, but the scorched-earth 
approach might be the quickest

Hi guys,

Pulling my hair out on this, I previously had an Ad Hoc Distribution

Provisioning Profile that I used to deploy to my testers via TestFlight,

that still works.

Ive now created a new Profile targeting the App Store. Created, downloaded

it, and I can see it in Xcode.


In MD I goto my project options, iPhone Bundle Signing, I have Developer

(Automatic) and Distribution (Automatic), as well as Developer: Me, and 
then

3 more Distribution: Me (all the same name) entries.


Selecting Distribution (Automatic) errors out on build with ambiguous name

due to the the 3 Distribution: Me entries. Selecting those manually, only 
1

has a provisioning profile, so I select that one and perform the build.

Thats when I get the following error:


No iPhone code signing key matches specified provisioning profile

'09DD5BC7-AA48-49FD-9C7D-D9BA8D4525FA'.


Any clues on what to do here? I would be happy deleting all profiles and

cleaning up the above bundle signing lists.


Thanks

John
