<PRE>After 16 months of constant development, I'm ready to go through a final
checklist.  I would *very much* appreciate guidance from any experienced
developer(s) who want to speak up.

Over such a long dev cycle, I've seen IOS update 3 times.  So, obviously, I
need to make sure I'm testing appropriately and making sure all is as it
should be.  Here are my basic questions, hoping some experienced people will
chime in and help me out :-)

1. What is the best way of testing against previous IOS versions, ie. revert
to previous IOS on device, xCode versions side-by-side (any issues?), etc...
2. What is the lowest version I should currently test against
3. Other than the standard guidelines and startup time, what &quot;gotchas&quot; would
anyone like to share?
4. Anything else

Well in advance, I'd like to thank anyone experienced with large-scale
release chiming in.
