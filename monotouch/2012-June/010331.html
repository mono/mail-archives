<PRE>
I need to have a Help screen for my app. I just need a simple table view
listing help topics, with the idea being that the user can tap a cell and go
to a new view with text on the topic in question. 

Although I've done a lot of work the past few weeks with UITableViews used
in various ways, I thought this Help functionality would be a good
opportunity to use MT.Dialog. 

I decided to make my Help screen by imitating the MTDReflectionWalkthrough
project because it seemed like the simplest and easiest example to follow. I
decided to make a Help class file as a parallel to the Expense file used in
the example. I just wanted to get the basic structure up and running (I
haven't worried about how to get tapping an element to push the new view
with help text on the tapped topic), so this is what I wrote: 

using System;
using MonoTouch.Dialog;

namespace CountyInfo
{
	public class Help
	{
		[Section (&quot;Help Topics&quot;)]

		[StringElement (&quot;Frequently Asked Questions&quot;, null)]

		[StringElement (&quot;How the App Works&quot;, null)]

		[StringElement (&quot;Searching for County Information&quot;, null)]

		[StringElement (&quot;County Regions&quot;, null)]


		[Section]

		[StringElement (&quot;About Thios App&quot;, null)]

	}
}

I have no idea yet if this will look like I want or support the
functionality I'm after, but it seemed like a safe start. But oddly (to me
at least) when I compile I get an &quot;unexpected symbol }&quot; error message for
the second-to-last closing curly bracket. That doesn't make sense to me
unless there's some sort of symbol I'm supposed to be using in the MT.Dialog
code there, but I don't know what that would be. 

Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong there?
