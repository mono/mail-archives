<PRE>Well, I modified the code block slightly, especially the DBHandler.cs class
file. Now the database is being created at runtime. But there is a problem.
Firstly, I am using the firefox addon version 3.7.1 for Sqlite and don't
know what should be the appropriate extension of the db file, db3 or sqlite.
Next thing is that I have developed the code such that the db file gets
created in a directory called ASTON Repository inside
[System.Environment.SpecialFolder.Personal]. But what is happening is that
it is being created in some place which has a physical path like  ---&gt;
users/Anupam/Library/Application Support/IPhone
Simulator/4.3/SomeRandomlyGeneratedFolderName/Applications/.Documents/DBFile

And a new SomeRandomlyGeneratedFolder is being created every time I run the
app and . I would like to incorporate some kind of checking logic so that so
that I can stop this spurious folder creation, and stop eating up needless
resource on the device. I haven't got much idea about where to save my db
file when the app would be running on an iphone. So please enlighten me.

Under my home directory, I have created a folder called Personal. Is it
possible to target this folder as the destination, where I can create the
ASTON Repository directory and inside it the db file? In that case, what
should be the path expression like?

Can you help me with this issue? I need some active help on this one.

Any kind of help would be immensely appreciated.
Thanks.
