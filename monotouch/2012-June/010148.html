<PRE>They are in store.  I just had a 5 minute play with one.

First impression was a little bit 'mmm', but that was because it looked exactly how I thought it would - just like my phone and iPad.  However, it is very nice.  Getting back to my current MBP to type this and I now miss the Retina Display -- my laptop looks all fuzzy and icky.

I did a quick test with MS Word, being a third party app that I knew wouldn't be updated for retina and text was quite fuzzy.  Changing the display to a scaled mode (1680 / 1920) made the text (in Word) look better.  I judge it to be similar to what I'm used to with this MBP.

It did have some glare / reflection issues in the shop, but I don't think it to be all that bad.  Certainly noticeable coming from a matte screen though.

My opinion, get it anyway.  Apps will get updated, the reflection isn't too bad.  You can run it scaled to get 1680 or 1920 &quot;resolution&quot;, which I would I think.  Typing this email just reminds how crap the text currently is and that things can most certainly be better to look at and read.

Cheers,
Greg
