<PRE>Thanks Wally,

As you know since then (2010), things have moved on in terms of MT.D for MT, as someone that has moved over from Microsoft C# (many years of programming), the differences in Xcode from Microsoft are massive, so for people in my position MT.D on top of MT cuts through a lot of that complexity, this is an area that should provide a quicker route to getting up and running rather than learning the whole Xcode/IB way of doing things.

I have to say that MT and MT.D are great products and I can't wait to become productive with them.

ATB

Alex

</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately this is what happens with reasonablly new products, they change shape frequently as they mature, I have been frustrated with the samples or the lack of with the current version of MT and MT.D, I am sure with time we will get some up to date samples. I remember the the version 1 release of .net and the quantity of changes in the next version.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO, when a new version of something is released samples showing the new features and changes should be released at the same time.
