<PRE>Pardon my ignorance on some of this. I'm new to Monotouch &amp; C#, but I'll push
my way through anyway.

In my test I was trying to build and run the app in debug mode.

I was getting a non-fatal build-time error, but the app did make it to the
iPhone simulator.  When I would try and move the picker dial, I would get an
immediate crash.  If I then would try to run the app directly from the
simulator, it would work fine.

Your 3 line modification does fix the runtime error, so we must be looking
at the same problem.

However, I'm still getting a non-fatal build time error: 

PickerView01[25059:1507] Application windows are expected to have a root
view controller at the end of application launch.

How do I get rid of it (not sure what it's talking about)?

The funny thing is that by flailing about, I too was able to get the
original code to run.  Specifically, I went into the Xcode designer and
created a dummy Outlet and then I deleted it.  This forced Monodevelop to
build a more robust version of MainWindow.xib.designer.cs.

I don't know what any of this means, but I think books are really important. 
So if it were up to me, I would fix MT/MD so it's compatible with the book
instead of vice versa.  I don't think there are too many books out there. 
Is there a better one than the one by McClure et al.?

BTW, is the original C# in the book valid or not?  And what is a &quot;GC&quot;? 
Thanks in advance for your feedback and time.
