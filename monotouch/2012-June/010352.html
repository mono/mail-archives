<PRE>Thanks for the reply,

On further investigation it looks like I will have to go down the api route to get this to work, I guess the next hurdle will be if Apple are happy with me doing that way, the URL's I have have the log and lat in them so I can pick them out, I might be left with the starting image being in the wrong direction. 

This is a key part of the application and is the main driving force for 'going mobile' so I need to find a way round this issue.

If I find a solution I will post it up.

ATB

&gt;<i> I think iOS detects any link to google maps and passes that to the mapping application.  This is possibly a requirement of their agreement with Google, and I'd be curious to see if this behavior changes in iOS 6.  Even if you explicitly type in maps.google.com in mobile safari, the mobile maps UI does not give you a street view option.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can get into street view from the maps app by clicking on a pin, but I don't know if there is any way to automate this from an external link
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know this doesn't really answer your question, but if your goal is to have street view on your device it appears that both Apple and Google are working against you

</I>&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> a small bit of history, I have an existing application that currently runs on MS windows it is database of points of interest, the application has a lot of users, each of these users uses google with the street view option to find these places of interest then using the link button on the page they copy and paste the actual street view links into their databases, this in most cases is the proper image of the point of interest not a map view.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> these databases contain up to 20,000 links like the one above so moving over to another system really is not an option considering that most of the work is still carried out on the PC's and these links are moved onto the iPhone/iPad for review later.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am not getting this to work properly in the UIWebview it is converting it into some sort of mapping app, this is not what I want it to do, I just want the UIWebview to display the URL I am passing and provide the results.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't mind if I have to shell out to safari but that does not seem to work either.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> UIWebView
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> NSUrl nsurl = new NSUrl(_address);
</I>&gt;<i> NSUrlRequest req = new NSUrlRequest(nsurl);
</I>&gt;<i> HtmlViewer.LoadRequest(req);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> openURL
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> UIApplication.SharedApplication.OpenUrl (new NSUrl (url));
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have tried both on the simulator and physical device, I know that Apple are moving away from google maps but this should still work as it is not really using the API as it it is web driven.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any ideas.
