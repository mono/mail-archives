<PRE>Dear list,

App works fine and Monotouch is awesome. The final showstopper is the silly
user decides to do something else (gasp!) and puts the app in the
background, and when restored later on one of three things happens:

1 App returns to where it was, great!
2 App has been killed by iOS in the background and stars anew, can live with
that!
3 Something in-between, and the app freezes. This isn't very good.

Up until now I haven't put much thought into the whole background/foreground
thing and find it surprisingly hard to come by any good resources how to do
this. The reason for the app freezing is probably me not properly restoring
the state of the application, but exactly what is it I need to save/restore?

The app I'm working on isn't the most complicated thing ever, but it's not
Hello ViewController either. For one thing, I have quite a few objects in
memory that responds to events. If iOS decides to kill them off, I can see
why the app freezes. If that's even possible? From what I understand, iOS
can &quot;reclaim memory&quot; (without killing the application), but exactly what
would that include? In memory objects? ViewControllers? Subviews? 

For me, it all comes down to this: When the user returns to the app, I need
to know &quot;what has iOS done to my application&quot; so I know how to respond.
Right now I answer that question with &quot;I have no idea and just hope scenario
1 or 2 plays out&quot;.

Any hints or docs on this is very very very much appreciated. This is, I
think, the last issue before I get super rich selling my app for $0 on the
appstore.
