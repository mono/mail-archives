&gt;<i> is there a blog or something that tells the story of MonoTouch? I think it should even become a book!
</I>
Miguel also wrote a blog article about MonoTouch history:

	<A HREF="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2009/Sep-14.html">http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2009/Sep-14.html</A>

&gt;<i> * How did it all start? What was the initial idea?
</I>
As per Miguel's blog, after the Mono 2.0 release Miguel asked his blog readers to fill out a survey indicating where Mono should go next, and they said &quot;iPhone!&quot; Given that System.Windows.Forms is horribly crappy on non-Windows platforms, binding the native API is the only sane thing to do...

&gt;<i> * What was the first line of code that was written?
</I>
I have no idea. From the commit log, various patches to mono were first, followed by a full sample app. I don't think I'd be far off in guessing that the first actual line of C# written was:

	using System;

;-)

&gt;<i> * How much reverse engineering was involved to find out how to get things working on an iPhone?
</I>
That would be a question for Mac-guru Geoff Norton. My understanding is that the basic binding scenario didn't require much in the way of reverse engineering: it's largely just a binding of Objective-C that doesn't require a JIT, and Objective-C is well understood.

&gt;<i> * What was the first app that ran in MonoTouch on an iPhone?
</I>
An internal test app, along the lines of &quot;Hello World&quot; with a button. Mono for Android had a very similar first sample (make a button + callback actually work), a variation of which is the default Mono for Android Application template...
