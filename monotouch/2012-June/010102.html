<PRE>I don't remember the option System.Windows.Forms on the survey :)

But crappy or not, I have Form, Control, ComboBox, Label and TextBox running
with main things that I use in Windows Mobile version, so each &quot;Form :
ViewController&quot;  can be easily ported to iPhone/iPad just making me the work
to draw it on Interface Builder and use there Label instead UILabel, etc&#138;
and all my core manipulation of forms and controls from windows mobile runs
OK :) (that run ok on windows). Has the Windows.Forms name but uses native
controls of course.

Not perfectly yet with all options (missing menuItem and TabControl) but is
running and evaluating beside application development and soon future port
to WP and Android (ok I still do not know what to do with intents vs
TrueInstantiatedObject)

I wasn't there at the very beginning, but I was there close to the
beginning...

Miguel also wrote a blog article about MonoTouch history:

<A HREF="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2009/Sep-14.html">http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2009/Sep-14.html</A>

&gt;<i>  * How did it all start? What was the initial idea?
</I>
As per Miguel's blog, after the Mono 2.0 release Miguel asked his blog
readers to fill out a survey indicating where Mono should go next, and they
said &quot;iPhone!&quot; Given that System.Windows.Forms is horribly crappy on
non-Windows platforms, binding the native API is the only sane thing to
do...

&gt;<i>  * What was the first line of code that was written?
</I>
I have no idea. From the commit log, various patches to mono were first,
followed by a full sample app. I don't think I'd be far off in guessing that
the first actual line of C# written was:

using System;

;-)

&gt;<i>  * How much reverse engineering was involved to find out how to get things
</I>&gt;<i> working on an iPhone?
</I>
That would be a question for Mac-guru Geoff Norton. My understanding is that
the basic binding scenario didn't require much in the way of reverse
engineering: it's largely just a binding of Objective-C that doesn't require
a JIT, and Objective-C is well understood.

&gt;<i>  * What was the first app that ran in MonoTouch on an iPhone?
</I>
An internal test app, along the lines of &quot;Hello World&quot; with a button. Mono
for Android had a very similar first sample (make a button + callback
actually work), a variation of which is the default Mono for Android
Application template...
