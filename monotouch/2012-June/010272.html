<PRE>Thanks Rolf,

no.5 was just a snip of code there is 5 root controllers in total.

Before I file any bugs (on the devices issues) what I am going to do to day is create a new project slowly bringing stuff from this broken project across and testing it on the device, hopefully I can pin down the offending items, my guess (un-educated at the moment) is that there is either corrupt stuff in one or more xib files or that there is some issues with renaming images within the IDE that has caused problems.

I will then try to work out the steps to recreating the issues if I can, this will help debug the issue and stop me falling into the same trap again, hopefully.

The last issue I will write a very small project as a test case and get it to fail then at least it is a simple one to look at.

Thanks again for you email.

ATB

Alex

</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These are the issues I have encountered in the last few days, hopefully some of them have simple fixes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. why does IB loose all my outlets on some of the view controllers, there was one in particular where it did not matter what order I did things if I created a few outlets and then saved the information, closed IB, reopened IB the outlets were missing every time, I ended up having to create the view controller from scratch to fix the issue.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A few bugs have been fixed in MonoDevelop lately in this area, so this might have been fixed already.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. why can't IB rename outlets properly, I have seen a couple of different things happen, firstly where the .designer.cs does not get updated, so manual changes in there were required, another issue was if you delete something with an outlet attached then add something and want to create an outlet with the same name, sometimes it fails and other times it creates two references in the .h file.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. why can't all references to a removed file e.g. an image file be found without having to search through the files, the build of the project works, and even runs on the simulator but not on a physical device.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a side-effect of how apps are installed on the device vs in the simulator. In the simulator the contents of the app is copied to the target directory, overwriting whatever is there (and leaving in place old files). On the device the existing app is first removed, then the new one is installed. Note that it is not MonoTouch that behaves like this, it's the Apple API we use.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4. why can I build and run in the simulator an application but when it is run on the physical device I get errors like 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -[UIBarButtonItem UTF8String]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x421c450
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> these errors don't occur on the simulator.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are a number of reasons this can happen, I'd need to see concrete sample code to say anything more.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5. using the tab bar out of the app delegate
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> e.g. at the class level
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ReviseVCiPhone _tbRevise;
</I>&gt;<i> OpenBikeListsVCiPhone _tbBikeLists;
</I>&gt;<i> UINavigationController [] _navigationRoots;
</I>&gt;<i> UITabBarController _tbController;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> inside finished launching
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> _tbController = new UITabBarController();
</I>&gt;<i> _tbRevise = new ReviseVCiPhone(&quot;Revise&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> _tbBikeLists = new OpenBikeListsVCiPhone(&quot;Open Bike Lists&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> _tbRevise.TabBarItem = new UITabBarItem(&quot;Revise&quot;, UIImage.FromBundle(&quot;Images/Toolbar/Revise.png&quot;), 0);
</I>&gt;<i> _tbBikeLists.TabBarItem = new UITabBarItem(&quot;Bike Lists&quot;, UIImage.FromBundle(&quot;Images/Toolbar/Bike.png&quot;),1);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> _navigationRoots = new UINavigationController [5] {
</I>&gt;<i> 	new UINavigationController (_tbRevise) {
</I>&gt;<i> 		TabBarItem = (UITabBarItem)_tbRevise.TabBarItem,
</I>&gt;<i> 	} ,
</I>&gt;<i> 	new UINavigationController (_tbBikeLists) {
</I>&gt;<i> 		TabBarItem = (UITabBarItem)_tbBikeLists.TabBarItem,
</I>&gt;<i> 	} 
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't tried this, but it looks like you create an array of 5 navigation controllers, but only set the first two elements to something.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> _tbController.SetViewControllers(_navigationRoots, false);				
</I>&gt;<i> _window.RootViewController = _tbController;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> navigating seems to work fine if I go into the root view controllers, then from them into other view controllers, but once I then go 3 levels deep I get GC errors on the root view controllers, this problem is fixed if I do something like the following in the button click on the third level view controllers
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ViewBikeListVCiPhone _viewBikeList = new ViewBikeListVCiPhone(_prevision_set,_description); this.NavigationController.PushViewController(_viewBikeList, false);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> surely this is not right, because if you set animate to true you are going forward not backwards if that makes sense.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a last word I recommend filing bugs for all issues you find, that way they won't end up lost in the mailing list and someone will fix it or explain the problem.
