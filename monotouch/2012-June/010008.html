<PRE>GC is Garbage Collection

there are at least 4 books available - Wally's is the oldest (I believe it
predates the iPad, as well as the complete redesign of XCode) and both iOS
and MT have changed a lot since then.

the &quot;root view controller&quot; issue is related to a change Apple made is iOS
5.  See this

</I>&gt;<i> So if it were up to me, I would fix MT/MD so it's compatible with the book

</I>&gt;<i> Is there a better one than the one by McClure et al.?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, is the original C# in the book valid or not?   And what is a &quot;GC&quot;?
