<PRE>I agree with the previous post.  Nuke everything and start over again.  

When you drag your .mobilieprovisioning file into XCode, does it say it's
valid or invalid? 

Is this a distribution build?

Also try:
If it's distribution, Go to the provisioning portal on the apple developer
site.  Try requesting a new Distribution Certificate.  You don't necessarily
have to delete the old one (not sure if you have anything tied to it), but
create a new one/download it/drag it into your keychain.  Also be sure to
create a new development certificate so that is fresh as well.  And don't
forget to check your apple ID and bundle ID to make sure you're not missing
something.
