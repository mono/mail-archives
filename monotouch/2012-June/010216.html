<PRE>I played with the Retina MBP (it's getting boring typing that, what's the
short name for this thing? R-MBP, RMBP, MBP-R...?!) for the first time at
lunch today - I have to say the screen sells itself.  I played with the
scaling options and viewed MS Word, Excel and thought they looked ok - the
icons within these apps look blocky, but text was fine (to me).  PDFs and
web page text in Safari was amazingly sharp though.  Still unknown what
it'll be like to RDP onto a Windows machine though, or whether you'll
constantly keep having to switch scaling options.

But, now looking at the poor icons along my Windows 7 task bar, makes me
realize how fuzzy they are.

Not sure if anyone is running Xcode or Monodevelop on one yet, as I'm
assuming the text within the IDEs should look good anyway (but icons will
look bad until they update them).

I was more impressed by the slimness and weight of it though - it's felt
surprisingly light, probably because the weight is spread over a bigger
footprint compared to the Air.
