<PRE>I agree that this is a problem. But its not the garbage collector, it is
just doing its job.  The problem is, that many of the APIs that you would
expect to hold a managed ref to your objects do not. To do things in a
&quot;.NETy&quot; kind of way, I would expect something like:

PushViewController (new MyController ()) to hold a reference to the new
MyController

&gt;<i> This is going to sound negative, but for all of us Monotouch enthusiasts,
</I>&gt;<i> please read between the lines at the heart of the issue and not just read
</I>&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;<i> as &quot;flaming&quot; - for monotouch developers, please just read.
</I>&gt;<i> -------
</I>&gt;<i> The changes to the garbage collector have got to get fixed.  Getting tired
</I>&gt;<i> of chasing &lt;unrecognized selector sent to instance&gt; exceptions.  Not all
</I>&gt;<i> variables can be declared and/or initialized at class scope (that seems to
</I>&gt;<i> be the &quot;quick fix&quot; given out for the problem, but really doesn't solve
</I>&gt;<i> much)
</I>&gt;<i> and I have seen zero productive feedback to anyone reporting the issue
</I>&gt;<i> (which many have).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Part of the c# pattern is a reliable garbage collector that behaves in a
</I>&gt;<i> predictable manner.  The use of lambda expressions and a reliance on
</I>&gt;<i> predictable behavior based on reference count is a key part of what c# is
</I>&gt;<i> all about.  Requiring variables to be declared at class scope, or allowing
</I>&gt;<i> these exceptions to continue with &quot;quick fix&quot; suggestions really doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> help much - we're talking about &quot;core language functionality&quot; here, not
</I>&gt;<i> optional features.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The attractiveness of c# over objective C is NOT just the language
</I>&gt;<i> semantics/framework, but also the behavior of the backend components, such
</I>&gt;<i> as a reliable garbage collector.  This is c# not a &quot;kinda c# hack&quot; right?
</I>&gt;<i> The objective of MT is a &quot;quicker learning curve&quot; by removing the
</I>&gt;<i> Objective-C component.  However, if the development pattern must change
</I>&gt;<i> (and
</I>&gt;<i> take more time tracking down bugs) because of faulty behavior, then the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;value add&quot; of MT is greatly reduced.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, please, do something about this or many people coming from stable c#
</I>&gt;<i> elsewhere will start to believe that learning Objective-C really isn't such
</I>&gt;<i> a bad thing after all.  MT is designed to attract existing c# developers,
</I>&gt;<i> but if the MT c# implementation and run-time behavior does not match or
</I>&gt;<i> come
</I>&gt;<i> close to what c# developers would expect will they have a &quot;positive&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> experience or a negative one.
</I>&gt;<i> --------
</I>&gt;<i> Again, to all those who would respond as MT enthusiasts - believe me, I can
</I>&gt;<i> imagine what you'll say, so please don't trash up the thread with flame @
</I>&gt;<i> me, or whatever.  The garbage collector is a real problem right now and has
</I>&gt;<i> gotta get fixed.  And, no, I'm not a noob - been developing in MT for over
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> year and have 20+ years professional development under my belt (mostly in
</I>&gt;<i> the PC/console games industry).  I simply want this solution to &quot;work&quot; as
</I>&gt;<i> expected for the language being used, as do we all I would assume.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, devs, please respond and let's get some information going on the
</I>&gt;<i> garbage
</I>&gt;<i> collector changes.  Which of the various errors reported are *really* due
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> an IOS bug and which are due to the collector.  So far it is all very vague
</I>&gt;<i> and no real information about a &quot;fix&quot; has been provided that I can tell.
</I>&gt;<i> I'd ask that you stop addressing specific scenarios, like &quot;when I click my
</I>&gt;<i> button I get an &lt;unrecognized selector&gt; in the event handler&quot; and begin
</I>&gt;<i> addressing the overall issue, which is the garbage collector.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks.
