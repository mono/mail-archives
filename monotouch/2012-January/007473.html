<PRE>This is going to sound negative, but for all of us Monotouch enthusiasts,
please read between the lines at the heart of the issue and not just read it
as &quot;flaming&quot; - for monotouch developers, please just read.
-------
The changes to the garbage collector have got to get fixed.  Getting tired
of chasing &lt;unrecognized selector sent to instance&gt; exceptions.  Not all
variables can be declared and/or initialized at class scope (that seems to
be the &quot;quick fix&quot; given out for the problem, but really doesn't solve much)
and I have seen zero productive feedback to anyone reporting the issue
(which many have).

Part of the c# pattern is a reliable garbage collector that behaves in a
predictable manner.  The use of lambda expressions and a reliance on
predictable behavior based on reference count is a key part of what c# is
all about.  Requiring variables to be declared at class scope, or allowing
these exceptions to continue with &quot;quick fix&quot; suggestions really doesn't
help much - we're talking about &quot;core language functionality&quot; here, not
optional features.

The attractiveness of c# over objective C is NOT just the language
semantics/framework, but also the behavior of the backend components, such
as a reliable garbage collector.  This is c# not a &quot;kinda c# hack&quot; right? 
The objective of MT is a &quot;quicker learning curve&quot; by removing the
Objective-C component.  However, if the development pattern must change (and
take more time tracking down bugs) because of faulty behavior, then the
&quot;value add&quot; of MT is greatly reduced.

So, please, do something about this or many people coming from stable c#
elsewhere will start to believe that learning Objective-C really isn't such
a bad thing after all.  MT is designed to attract existing c# developers,
but if the MT c# implementation and run-time behavior does not match or come
close to what c# developers would expect will they have a &quot;positive&quot;
experience or a negative one.
--------
Again, to all those who would respond as MT enthusiasts - believe me, I can
imagine what you'll say, so please don't trash up the thread with flame @
me, or whatever.  The garbage collector is a real problem right now and has
gotta get fixed.  And, no, I'm not a noob - been developing in MT for over a
year and have 20+ years professional development under my belt (mostly in
the PC/console games industry).  I simply want this solution to &quot;work&quot; as
expected for the language being used, as do we all I would assume.

So, devs, please respond and let's get some information going on the garbage
collector changes.  Which of the various errors reported are *really* due to
an IOS bug and which are due to the collector.  So far it is all very vague
and no real information about a &quot;fix&quot; has been provided that I can tell. 
I'd ask that you stop addressing specific scenarios, like &quot;when I click my
button I get an &lt;unrecognized selector&gt; in the event handler&quot; and begin
addressing the overall issue, which is the garbage collector.

Thanks.
