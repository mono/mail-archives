Subject: Re: [MonoTouch] Dots in project and file names

Hi Alec,

I've just fixed this in git master, so the next release of MonoDevelop should resolve this issue. What I did was to make it name the files as:

This_Is_Another_TestViewController_iPad.xib
This_Is_Another_TestViewController.iPhone.xib

Hi Alec,

This probably continues to work because the xib files using _'s are likely left behind in the installed app bundle (for simulator, we just copy over new files but don't remove stale files, if I remember correctly).

As far as the rest, I'm a little fuzzy on the details, but I thought I remember hearing a discussion about how .'s were illegal in app names or the executable name or some such.

However, what you encountered in here is very clearly a bug in MonoDevelop. At the very least, the project templates should be using the same sanitized string for the xib filenames as it does for the strings it uses in the code itself.

I'll try to fix this in a minute. In the meantime, I guess avoid using .'s in your project names.

Hi all,

I have a project which was running quite happily until I did a couple of upgrades. One was to the iOS 5 SDK, and one was a MonoTouch update. I'm using the emulator.

The issue can be demonstrated as follows:

Create a new universal, single view project, and give it a name containing dots = e.g. &quot;This.Is.Another.Test&quot;
You'll see the following files:

This.Is.Another.TestViewController.cs
This.Is.Another.TestViewController_iPad.xib
This.Is.Another.TestViewController_iPhone.xib

Inside the first one you'll see the following code:

            public This_Is_Another_TestViewController ()
                  : base (UserInterfaceIdiomIsPhone ? &quot;This_Is_Another_TestViewController_iPhone&quot; : &quot;This_Is_Another_TestViewController_iPad&quot;, null)
            {
            }

Prior to my updates this would have been happy. Since the updates it causes the following error to be thrown if I debug:

Objective-C exception thrown.  Name: NSInternalInconsistencyException Reason: Could not load NIB in bundle: 'NSBundle &lt;/Users/...../Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/5.0/Applications/4DF37899-5C35-478D-BE25-E1B9CB681017/ThisIsAnotherTest.app&gt; (loaded)' with name 'This_Is_Another_TestViewController_iPhone'

This is thrown when execution hits the window.MakeKeyAndVisible() line in AppDelegate.cs.

At this point I've not written any code at all. I can get the project to run successfully if I rename the two xib files, replacing the dots with underscores so that they match exactly the names specified in This.Is.Another.TestViewController.cs, i.e.:

This_Is_Another_TestViewController_iPad.xib
This_Is_Another_TestViewController.iPhone.xib

Debugging now works fine.

Interestingly, at this point I can rename the two xib files back, replacing the underscores with the original dots again, and it works fine - even if I run a clean before debugging. Presumably something's getting left somewhere.

Any thoughts?
