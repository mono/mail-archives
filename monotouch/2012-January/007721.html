<PRE>Hi all,

I just upgraded to MT version 5.2.1, and my app builds and deploys to the
phone just fine. However, the debugger won't connect and i get the
following error message popup (presumable from a timeout):

The connection with the debugger has been lost. The target application may
have exited.

Mono did this on occasion with older versions and could usually be remedied
by a MD restart, but since the latest upgrade, it fails every time.

My device is - of course - plugged in, reads fine in Xcode, and all that
good stuff. Then after this happens, I go to exit MonoDevelop, and MD,
gives me the pinwheel of death, and the only way to exit is by a force
quite.

Has anyone seen this? Any remedies?

My version info is:
MonoDevelop: 2.8.6.4
MonoTouch: 5.2.1
Mono Framework: 2.10.8.1

Cheers,
Brett
