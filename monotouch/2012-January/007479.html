<PRE>For my 2c, I've seen this as a problem that other people have had -
not something I've had in my own code. (so far). So maybe it's
something I'm (not?) doing...

Like any development, there has to be trade offs. Look at the full
framework on Windows, for example. There are 2 versions (server and
client) which have very, VERY different GC profiles: the client GC's
quickly and often to keep memory usage down, the server does it very
infrequently to keep performance up, but is expected to have a lot of
RAM to work in. .NET Compact Framework was** closer to MonoTouch, tho
MSFT had control over more parts of it.

So I would expect something even more different to those on a mobile
device which has very limited resources. If we had the windows server
CLR's GC model on a mobile device, none of us would actually be doing
anything - our apps would just crash with out of memory errors, and
hello world would ship as a 20meg+ binary. Or the app would pause for
ages while it GC'ed, which would be even worse.

For me, thats part of the process of learning mobile development: how
the whole system works, in the same way I don't expect (or want to)
use windows forms or WPF on the phone*, I expect to have to adapt to
the constraints of the platform and environment. Lack of resources and
an agressive GC are two of those constraints.

(Maybe this stemmed out of learning .NET using the Compact Framework.
Even when I'm doing server stuff (my day job), I'm still thinking
about where objects are stored and released, leaks, excessive object
creation etc)

Clearly, this (GCing) is a problem for you and others, or you wouldn't
have written this. From my perspective, this is a trade off for being
able to use C# - a language I like a lot - on the iPhone - a platform
I like a lot, and one I'm willing to work with or around. It does need
addressing by Xamarin, but (IMO) it might be more of a documentation /
education thing than a code change. Or more likely, both.

* ok, maybe silverlight and a form a declarative UI constructions....
maybe. Thats kinda what IB is...

** I've not used it since v1 and 1.1, so that might have changed a bit
