<PRE>Hi, I use Monotouch 5.0.4 / Mono 2.10.8 / MonoDevelop 2.8.5 / Mac OS X 10.7.2
/ Xcode 4.2.1

I have downloaded the monotouch examples from here :
 <A HREF="https://github.com/xamarin/monotouch-samples">https://github.com/xamarin/monotouch-samples</A> 
and compiled the MapCallouts example. It runs fine on the device. I then
create on the same project a new test view controller with a mapView control
attached to it, by using the Xcode procedure which is described in one of
the tutorials (for the connection of the mapview outlet and the other
stuff). This declares the mapview control as a class variable of the parent
viewcontroller. 
I use the resulting viewcontroller (cs and xib files) instead of the
example's viewcontroller and the application throws a consistent SIGSEGV
error on the device. 
It runs well on the simulator. 
If I try to manually create the view controller with the mapview control in
it declared as a class variable of the viewcontroller class, I take the same
error on the device. 
It runs well on the simulator. 

I do not know if this has something to do with the mapview control since all
the other viewcontrollers I have created, and do not include maps, work well
on the device.

A search on the forum and the internet indicates that SIGSEGV errors have
something to do with the garbage collector on the device, but I have already
done something for this issue since my mapview control is declared as a
class variable. And how is it possible for the downloaded example to work
well and when I use the new identical xib file I get a crash?

I have uploaded the MapCallouts solution which includes my viewcontroller
(MapViewController class) for test case
(<A HREF="http://www.mediafire.com/?dpmrqfnicag83gk">http://www.mediafire.com/?dpmrqfnicag83gk</A>).
It runs well on the simulator, it crashes on the device.


Any help would be appreciated especially because of the time pressure.

Thanks in advance.
