<PRE>This is something I am more than enthusiastic about, i'm pretty much
vibrating with excitement.

What I'd like to see in the order of my priorities:

- Paths and annotations would be immense - annotations are a must for this
kind of thing I recon - paths are more of a boon but of it is possible then
that would be seriously cool.
- Ability to overlay the map over the camera output for some serious AR
jiggery pockery.
- layers - highlight regions on the map.
- Inclusion of terrain data in the United Kingdom (UK is much prettier so i
think it should be dealt with first - jk) so that mountains are mountains.
On this note, how would this data be obtained?

Soooooo..... moving on. Are you happy to accept help on this? I'm no where
near the level of understanding that you have on map libs but this I think
could turn into a core feature of a lot of our work and I'm sure a lot of
other peoples work. It's actually amazing, kicks the shizbang out of the
standard maps and works so well already, even in it's infancy.

If you are happy to accept help I think (from my initial playing about and
talking with you) there are a couple of things that need to be sorted before
moving the project on which I can jump right in and sort:

- configurable things (stuff like tile storage space etc)
- cache expiration + cleanup (though someone said superyeti had taken this
on already?)
- please add...

I would like to push for annotations as that will cover the basic
requirements for a map lib and then everything else added from there is just
making a great tool even better and far ahead of the game.

What say you?

&gt;<i> As it's my project I had better state its state.

</I>&gt;<i> Caulker is still in its infancy. I started the project for an up-coming
</I>&gt;<i> app. The goal was to have a mapping engine that utilized 3D cartesian math
</I>&gt;<i> (instead of projection math) so I could do augmented reality / game style
</I>&gt;<i> rendering. That is, I plan to have &quot;chase cameras&quot; and &quot;arial cameras&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, I wanted a game engine that used real world data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> State of the project: certainly incomplete. I will pick up active
</I>&gt;<i> development toward the end of the summer (two apps to complete before the
</I>&gt;<i> one that will use this engine). However, I am open to ideas / feature
</I>&gt;<i> requests.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Planned features include:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (1) Inclusion of terrain data in the United States so that mountains are
</I>&gt;<i> mountains.
</I>&gt;<i> (2) More work on cameras (blimp and chase being the most important)
</I>&gt;<i> (3) Addition of paths and annotations
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Features not planned but considered:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (1) Routing library
</I>&gt;<i> (2) Feature search

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm really interested in mapping and augmented reality stuff in mt and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stumbled upon caulker. Looks like a nice replacement to the default mapping
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stuff but i also spotted this:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/caulker/source/browse/Caulker/Camera.cs">http://code.google.com/p/caulker/source/browse/Caulker/Camera.cs</A>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the code. Without looking too far into it and without being able to run
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this at the mo as i'm at work, this looks like code for augmented reality.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Am i right?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is either  fak or superyeti on this list? Can you confirm if i'm right or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wrong and also what state this project is in? I can see that nothing has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been commited since may?
