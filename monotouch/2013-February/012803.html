<PRE>I began the project of my client with MonoCross and it was great. The
change was significant, MonoCross has many of the benefits that ASP.NET MVC
also has:
route system, uncoupling between layers and many others. When Greg (thanks
to him) named a few benefits of MVVMCross, I thought &quot;ok, they are good,
but I can reach them on my own,  e.g. easy test or DI..&quot; But I couldn't be
more mistaken, the last two days I have been playing around MVVMCross
(basically setting up the environment and learning the basics).

Today I tasted the power of MVVMCross. I didn't think it twice, so I
started to migrate my client's project from MonoCross to MVVMCross and in a
few hours I had almost half of the project migrated. It was easy for me
because under the hook, MC and MVVMC are similar and I made a good
separation of the concerns, so I only had to make a few changes to my code.

I really think that MVVMCross should be included in Xamarin's stack, with
MVVMCross under the arm the crossplatform development (and also the
non-crossplatform) goes to the next level.

Thank you Stuart!!

&gt;<i> I haven't used MonoCross, but I have been using MvvmCross so I can provide
</I>&gt;<i> some opinions there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> TL;DR: shared behavior, native views, testable, extensible
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have really enjoyed using the framework for a variety of reasons:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - Binding support on iOS and Android
</I>&gt;<i>    - A lot of app behavior gets put into viewmodels and is reusable
</I>&gt;<i>    across platforms
</I>&gt;<i>    - Since viewmodels are platform-agnostic, I can write unit tests that
</I>&gt;<i>    cover most of the app's behavior
</I>&gt;<i>    - View models are shared, but views remain totally native
</I>&gt;<i>    - You can customize how view models are presented based on your needs
</I>&gt;<i>    (such as showing multiple at once for a tablet version)
</I>&gt;<i>    - DI/IoC can be used
</I>&gt;<i>    - The framework itself is very extensible, allowing for a lot of
</I>&gt;<i>    customization if you need it
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I realize this basically ended up being more of a features list, but it
</I>&gt;<i> sums up the main reasons I continue to happily use the framework. Hope this
</I>&gt;<i> helps!
</I>&gt;<i>
