<PRE>Hi Jason,

Thanks very much for pointing me in the direction of the testflightapp.com, this is the missing link for me, I have for the first time, seen my app on an iPad.

I really needed a way of getting builds onto either an iPad or iPhone quickly, and this does the job perfectly.

TBH I don't need debugging as I already know what the issues are going to be with differences between the sim and real devices, my goal was to get the program running on the devices so that user acceptance testing can happen.

Thanks again for the information.
 
The error if I try to upload to the device is 

Initializing file service...
Transferring application
Finalizing file service...
Installing application
Installation failed: Send Message Error (error: 0xe800002d)
error MT1006: Could not install the application '/Users/alexwhite/Projects/WizPR/WizPR/bin/iPhone/Release/WizPR.app' on the device: Send Message Error (error: 0xe800002d).
The application was terminated by a signal: SIGHUP

not that I am that bothered about it right now as I have a way of getting the program onto the devices.

ATB

Alex

</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have been developing an iPhone/iPad application, TBH the development is going fine most of my issues now are deployment to devices to allow people to debug the application, this has been very hit and miss (with very little hit!), it is unacceptable for me to spend many hours in front of a client trying to debug why I cannot deploy to their devices, this will undermine their confidence in the project, so my question is this, what is the most stable version of mac OX, Xcode, MonoTouch and IOS for both the iPhone and iPad, as I will now flush the macbook and start again, otherwise my project will fail at this stage, it is not acceptable to have to get anyone involved when I am deploying to their phones other than me, this just does not look professional at all. I have spent the last couple of days attempting to deploy to my wires iPad with zero success. My client's patients is wearing thin with my excuses.
