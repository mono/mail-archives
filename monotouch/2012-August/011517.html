<PRE>I'm a new MonoTouch user, and I have two questions.

(a) I'm a bit confused about the rules for MonoTouch method renaming.
Personally I'd prefer if method names were kept as unadultered as possible,
because it would make Objective-C docs and code-snippets as easy to
'translate over' as possible. However, if there is some kind of name
changing going on, it would be nice if it was consistent. For example,
consider the two following name munges..

[UIView drawRect:(CGRect)rect]
    --&gt; UIView.Draw(RectangleF rect)

[UIView drawRect:(CGRect)rect
forViewPrintFormatter:(UIViewPrintFormatter)formatter]
    --&gt; UIView.DrawRect(RectangleF rect, UIViewPrintFormatter formatter);

I could understand the rewriting rule that Objective-C/Smalltalk style
argument descriptors in the method names are removed. However, in that
case, both C# methods should be just &quot;UIView.Draw&quot;. It's especially
confusing that seeing both &quot;Draw()&quot; and &quot;DrawRect()&quot; where the one with the
&quot;Rect&quot; is actually different because of the PrintFormatter paramater, not
because of a rect.

It would be more consistent if they were both just Draw(...), but if there
is some reason they need to be named differently, the latter being
DrawWithFormatter(...) seems more appropriate.

If there is some reason Is this just an oversight in the naming here, or is
there a reason behind this?

(b) I couldn't find a convenience way to use a standard C# Enumerator on
NSSet, which seems quite a common and obvious thing to do. Is it buried in
there somewhere, or is there some reason it was omitted?  I use the
following extension method for NSSet..

public static class MyExtensions {
    public static IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; ItemsAs&lt;T&gt;(this NSSet set) where T :
NSObject {
        List&lt;T&gt; res = new List&lt;T&gt;();

        set.Enumerate( delegate( NSObject obj, ref bool stop ) {
            T item = (T)( obj ); // Executed only once, not 3 times
            if ( item != null ) {
                res.Add (item);
                stop = false; // inside the null check
            }
        });
        return res;

    }
}
