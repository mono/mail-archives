<PRE>I have gotten a black screen, as well, but I'm not sure if it's the same issue you're experiencing.  I believe it happened immediately after deploying (it didn't work fine and then have problems on restart - I got the black screen on the first start of the app).

If I remember correctly, I found that I had to do a clean of the solution and redeploy to work around it.  After doing that, it worked again - no code or project configuration changes.  I don't know what was causing it, though.

Thank you,

Subject: Re: [MonoTouch] Black Screen of death

Still Priliminary, but so far it seems to work...

It seems it is related to compilation method.

I was trying to achieved a Arm6 +  Arm7 compilation, and it was creating
that black screen.

Since I switched it back to Arm7 only then it seems to work...

Will do further testing but so far it looks good...

Anyone got this issue?
