<PRE>Hi,

I have been developing an iPhone/iPad application, TBH the development is going fine most of my issues now are deployment to devices to allow people to debug the application, this has been very hit and miss (with very little hit!), it is unacceptable for me to spend many hours in front of a client trying to debug why I cannot deploy to their devices, this will undermine their confidence in the project, so my question is this, what is the most stable version of mac OX, Xcode, MonoTouch and IOS for both the iPhone and iPad, as I will now flush the macbook and start again, otherwise my project will fail at this stage, it is not acceptable to have to get anyone involved when I am deploying to their phones other than me, this just does not look professional at all. I have spent the last couple of days attempting to deploy to my wires iPad with zero success. My client's patients is wearing thin with my excuses.

Thanks.

Kind Regards


Alex
