<PRE>I am not sure I follow your reply.  I was giving multiple options, yet you
said it all sounded correct.

Let me add some specifics.  I am trying to use the ESRI ArcGIS thirdparty
framework.  I have already started writing the ApiDefinition.cs file to wrap
the Objective-C code in C# bindings.  It is working well.  However, the
ArcGIS ships as a framework and a Resources directory containing both a
ArcGIS.bundle and Info.plist file.  In normal Objective-C xcode world, they
state to add the ArcGIS.bundle file to the xcode project and add a
dependency on the ArcGIS.framework.  I know that the code in the
ArcGIS.framework uses resources from the ArcGIS.bundle when rendering its
UI.  So the question is how to get those resources available to the wrapped
ArcGIS.dll that I create?

I tried added the ArcGIS.bundle (really a directory) to my top level ios
Monotouch application project as a directory.  That helped a little in that
my app can now see some of the resources, but not all.  The ESRI map
component is supposed to have &quot;esri&quot; in the bottom left corner of the
MapView which is just one of the images in the ArcGIS.bundle.  It is NOT
finding this image, however, it is finding the GpsLocation.png image used to
show the current device location on the map.  I am confused as to how some
of the images in the ArcGIS.bundle can be found, yet some cannot.  Also, do
I have to use the Info.plist file at all??
