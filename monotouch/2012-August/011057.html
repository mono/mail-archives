<PRE>&gt;<i> OK, always been a xamarin fan.  However, perhaps their support has changed
</I>&gt;<i> because in response to this problem, I got a &quot;a web search doesn't produce
</I>&gt;<i> much, perhaps we could look at your code&quot;.  Umm, web search?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Stock Monotouch, create an iphone project (single view), push to ipod gen2
</I>&gt;<i> physical device, run it, hit home button, go back to app - it terminates on
</I>&gt;<i> suspend, always.  This is a deal breaker for me.  I could have simply ran
</I>&gt;<i> this in the simulator, felt secure that it worked and published it - but
</I>&gt;<i> now
</I>&gt;<i> xamarin has someone who is actually testing on physical gen2 devices
</I>&gt;<i> running
</I>&gt;<i> 4.2.1 reporting an issue and all I get is a &quot;Web search&quot; and dismissive
</I>&gt;<i> reply?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not going to gripe too much here, but wow, come on guys.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I looked up the support thread and it is a case of your hardware not having
support for background operations.   Perhaps they emailed you this
information after you posted to the mailing list.

&gt;<i>From Wikipedia:
</I>
&quot;The 2nd and 3rd generation iPod Touch can be updated to iOS 4.x for free,
but cannot take advantage of features using the iPhone's camera or GPS
receiver. The 2nd generation iPod Touch is further unable to take advantage
of iOS 4's multitasking and home screen background customization features,
unless the firmware is modified (through jailbreaking), and cannot be
upgraded beyond iOS version 4.2.1. Later updates of iOS beyond 4.2.1 are no
longer supported due to the outdated hardware. The iPod Touch (2nd
generation) is model A1288.&quot;
