<PRE>Hi Robert,

I was about to respond to your support case, too - Bryan asked for a
bit of help with it. As I've been travelling, I've not been as active
on the lists as normal - sorry about that.

I have a iPod Touch 2nd Gen at home (I'm in Boston at the moment, I
live in London), as it's my base device for my apps. It's basically an
iPhone 3G, with a bit less memory (128 vrs 256? Not 100% sure. It's
SLOW tho).

I have always assumed (and confirmed) that it does not support
multitasking. You can check this by:

UIDevice.CurrentDevice.IsMultitaskingSupported

False means that it will terminate your app when you hit the home button.

I can't confirm it here, but based on my own testing in the past, it
will return false, always. This is the same behaviour as an iPhone 3G.

If you hit the home button, it should fire the WillTerminate
AppDelegate method, and then kill the app. At that point, you need to
save your state (if you want to restore state when you start up
again), and restore it in FinishedLaunching. This is what the likes of
Twitter does - they store where you are in the UI, and restore it all
to that when you come back.

If you want, I can double check when I get back with both a MT app and
also a ObjC one, but based on my experience, neither will allow the
app (or any user app) to run in the background. This old engadget
article has a full list:

The only way to enable user-app multitasking on a 3G/iPodTouch2ndGen
is to jailbreak.


hope that helps

Nic

</I>&gt;<i> From Wikipedia:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The 2nd and 3rd generation iPod Touch can be updated to iOS 4.x for free,
</I>&gt;<i> but cannot take advantage of features using the iPhone's camera or GPS
</I>&gt;<i> receiver. The 2nd generation iPod Touch is further unable to take advantage
</I>&gt;<i> of iOS 4's multitasking and home screen background customization features,
</I>&gt;<i> unless the firmware is modified (through jailbreaking), and cannot be
</I>&gt;<i> upgraded beyond iOS version 4.2.1. Later updates of iOS beyond 4.2.1 are no
</I>&gt;<i> longer supported due to the outdated hardware. The iPod Touch (2nd
</I>&gt;<i> generation) is model A1288.&quot;
