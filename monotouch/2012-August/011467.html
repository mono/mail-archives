<PRE>can you deploy to your device directly from MD?  That should tell you if
the problem is isolated to TF or is a general problem with your
provisioning.  You can also look inside your app bundle and the
provisioning file that is getting embedded and verify that your UUID is
there.  I've had problems in the past where old stuff got stuck in my app
bundle, or newer things failed to update.  Sometimes it helps to delete
everything from the terminal so you can be sure that everything will get
updated on the next build

Most of the problems I've had in the past with TF were user error - either
I forgot to update a device in the provisioning portal and update all of
the certs, or the user didn't understand the workflow on the TF side.  It's
not complicated, but it can be a little confusing the first few times you
do it

I agree that Apple has made the entire process overcompilcated - and they
really don't provide any good tools for debugging deployment issues.  This
is why I like TF - they provide a nice interface on top of that process to
make it easier to manage
