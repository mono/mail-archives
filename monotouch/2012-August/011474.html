<PRE>You could also try to install while your phone is plugged in with the
xcode organiser showing the console - iOS is quite good with error
messages, so you should be able to see whats going on.

</I>&gt;<i> can you deploy to your device directly from MD?  That should tell you if the

</I>&gt;<i> can be sure that everything will get updated on the next build
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most of the problems I've had in the past with TF were user error - either I

</I>&gt;<i> certs, or the user didn't understand the workflow on the TF side.  It's not
</I>&gt;<i> complicated, but it can be a little confusing the first few times you do it
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that Apple has made the entire process overcompilcated - and they
</I>&gt;<i> really don't provide any good tools for debugging deployment issues.  This
</I>&gt;<i> is why I like TF - they provide a nice interface on top of that process to
</I>&gt;<i> make it easier to manage

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi All,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This process is getting very frustrating, I am now using TestFlightApp to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> get my betas out to users, to say this process is flaky is an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> understatement, to simplify things I have only one provisioning profile and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one development profile, I have one user that just cannot get his device to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> register via the TestFlightApp email, but that is not the one I am getting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really upset about it is my iPhone that now does not have permission to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> install the latest beta it is included in both profiles, but clicking on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> email from testfightapp I just get back the message &quot;this device cannot
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> install this item&quot;, in testflightapp it is not one of the permitted devices,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have removed all the profiles and rebuilt them and only two devices show
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up as permitted.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have wasted another 4 hours going round in circles, tell me I am doing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something wrong or is this what I can expect from developing IOS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> applications because if that is the case I am ready to throw in the towel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and drop IOS development, I just feel that apple have locked this stuff up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so tight that it is almost unusable.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks
