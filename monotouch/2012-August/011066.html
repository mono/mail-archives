<PRE>&gt;<i> From what I have read so far, it seems that we must obtain the following
</I>&gt;<i> hardware:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. the iPad  ($500)
</I>&gt;<i> 2. a Mac (Mini-Mac) will suffice  ($700)
</I>&gt;<i> 3. MonoTouch seat license ($400)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Must? No. They do help tho. You will need a device (iPad) before you
deploy to the store - the simulator isn't enough for proper testing.

But you can just get the mac, and xcode (from the Mac AppStore) and
the trial of monotouch and you can use the simulator.

&gt;<i> 1. Which websites or informational resources helped you the most, to learn
</I>&gt;<i> MonoTouch?
</I>
MonoTouch itself is fairly easy given your background. You will need
to learn SOME obj-c, as all of Apple's examples are in that. Just
enough to work out what you are looking it. I'd recommend Aaron
Hilligas' books:

<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/iOS-Programming-Ranch-Edition-Guides/dp/0321821521/ref=dp_ob_title_bk">http://www.amazon.com/iOS-Programming-Ranch-Edition-Guides/dp/0321821521/ref=dp_ob_title_bk</A>

You will have to mentially map some of it to C#, but it's a good place
to start to get an idea of the platform.

Failing that: <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=monotouch">http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=monotouch</A>

All of these are good, tho check the author's sites for updated
samples, as things move very quickly, so some of it might mention
xcode 3, which is quite different to xcode 4.

If you want to do cross platform, Greg's book (on that list) is really
good for iOS + Android + WP7 comparison.

&gt;<i> 2. Is there additional hardware I need besides what is listed above?
</I>
Nope. Mac (any) + a device is all you need.

&gt;<i> 3. Are there any consultants you know of which might be contracted for a
</I>&gt;<i> short period of time to help jump start our project?
</I>
You would need to ask around here, so I'll let others chime in. Also
maybe ping <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monotouch">support at xamarin</A>, they may have some ideas. There is also
training available, eg

<A HREF="http://www.pluralsight-training.net/microsoft/Courses/TableOfContents/mono-touch">http://www.pluralsight-training.net/microsoft/Courses/TableOfContents/mono-touch</A>

&gt;<i> 4. Anything other tips you think might be helpful.
</I>
CocoaTouch is quite different to .NET in terms of design, so try not
to assume too much.

In general, there is a good chance Apple have thought about anything
UI-ish that you want to do (atleast initially). Look for something in
the docs, rather than just trying to recreate things.

Design for touch. If you were not doing touch before (looks like you
were tho), rethink your app design. Tapworthy from Josh Clark (book)
is good, and not iOS/MonoTouch etc specific.

Or ask here, or chat.xamarin.com, or StackOverflow
