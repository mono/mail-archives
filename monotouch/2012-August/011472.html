<PRE>Hi Jason,

I am really struggling with this, the bit I can't seem to figure that seems to be the problem is that uuid must be wrong in my project for my device, all the other devices seem to be ok, I have recreated everything I can think of but my iPhone still does not have the right permissions, so I have looked in the app bundle I could not view the provisioning profile, it wants to open it in Xcode and that does nothing. So I have deleted everything under the bin folder in the project this has made no difference, so there is something else in the project causing the issue, to confirm I have deleted all the development and distribution profiles and rebuilt them, so I am at a complete loss right now.

ATB

Alex

&gt;<i> can you deploy to your device directly from MD?  That should tell you if the problem is isolated to TF or is a general problem with your provisioning.  You can also look inside your app bundle and the provisioning file that is getting embedded and verify that your UUID is there.  I've had problems in the past where old stuff got stuck in my app bundle, or newer things failed to update.  Sometimes it helps to delete everything from the terminal so you can be sure that everything will get updated on the next build
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Most of the problems I've had in the past with TF were user error - either I forgot to update a device in the provisioning portal and update all of the certs, or the user didn't understand the workflow on the TF side.  It's not complicated, but it can be a little confusing the first few times you do it
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that Apple has made the entire process overcompilcated - and they really don't provide any good tools for debugging deployment issues.  This is why I like TF - they provide a nice interface on top of that process to make it easier to manage

</I>&gt;<i> Hi All,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This process is getting very frustrating, I am now using TestFlightApp to get my betas out to users, to say this process is flaky is an understatement, to simplify things I have only one provisioning profile and one development profile, I have one user that just cannot get his device to register via the TestFlightApp email, but that is not the one I am getting really upset about it is my iPhone that now does not have permission to install the latest beta it is included in both profiles, but clicking on the email from testfightapp I just get back the message &quot;this device cannot install this item&quot;, in testflightapp it is not one of the permitted devices, I have removed all the profiles and rebuilt them and only two devices show up as permitted.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have wasted another 4 hours going round in circles, tell me I am doing something wrong or is this what I can expect from developing IOS applications because if that is the case I am ready to throw in the towel and drop IOS development, I just feel that apple have locked this stuff up so tight that it is almost unusable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks
