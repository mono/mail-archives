Hi Mike,

We're not able to reproduce this problem on our end. I've got a few questions for you that might help give us a better handle on the situation.

How often do you have to build for a physical device in order to reset the project? 
What exactly happens when the developers try running the app? Does it crash, error? Have you connected the debugger/instruments to the phone to debug this process?
Have you updated MonoDevelop / MonoTouch / XCode to the latest versions?
Do you think you could send us a screencast of the build/deploy process you're running?

Thanks!
-Bryan

Hi Mike,

I had a look into this, and without using &quot;Copy to Output Directory&quot;, everything worked as expected, where did you read that you need to add that? Using the build action just as content should work fine and allow you to do this correctly. Is it possible to not use Copy to Output Directory and see if that resolves the issue?

Thanks in advanced,

Chris Hardy

I have an issue with the Test Flight and the applications settings. I build a project prior to me adding a application setting bundle with applications settings and a compiled my project and sent to test flight and it worked fine. All my testers were able to download the application and run it.

Now the only difference is that I added a application settings  &quot;Root.plist&quot; file and set it's Build Action to &quot;Content&quot; and Copy to Out directory to &quot;Always copy&quot;. Which I read is the way to set those properties. Now when I publish the application to test flight my users get the application but cannot open it.

If physically take my tester's IPhone and connect it to my Mac and build it on their phone and then disconnect it. Then I publish another build and push it to them via Test Flight then it works for subsequent builds being pushed via test flights.

So  somehow the app settings are messing up my distribution.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
