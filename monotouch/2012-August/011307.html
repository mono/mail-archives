<PRE>Hi,

I'm getting a bit nervous here. I had a deal with Alex Soto (dalexsoto) to deliver bindings for a PDF library until today. Unfortunately the last thing I heard from him was on August 13 that he would be in an area with bad reception and that he'll call me in a few hours. This SMS was sent from an unknown number, I suppose his cellphone.
But since then: nothing. No reaction on emails, no reaction on the phone.

He used to be pretty active on the list here and I have not read anything from him recently.
Now I'm facing various issues:

1. I'm scared that something bad happened to him! Does anybody know him and had contact and can confirm that he's okay!?
2. Did anybody have to do with him previously? Was he delivering on time? He seemed pretty eager to get things done and I don't think he would just disappear. Especially because I told him that if he cannot deliver, it's not an issue, I just have to KNOW in order to find an alternative.
3. If I really cannot get in touch with him again: can somebody here create bindings for the PDF library from pspdfkit.com? It has around 90 header files. If yes, get in touch with me for details on payment, etc.

Thanks and I really hope somebody has good news for me!

Regards,

Ren&#233;
</PRE>
