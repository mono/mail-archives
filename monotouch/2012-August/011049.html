<PRE>I've had a request from a client for something I've never done before.
Basically, they want to have a video (no audio) stored on about 20 devices
(iPads). They want the same video (or just the audio) stored on a central,
Windows based computer. They want to be able to trigger the audio on the
central computer (which will be played to the entire room) whilst triggering
the video on the devices; keeping the video playback in sync with the audio.
I'll need to supply the Windows and iOS apps. [phew - I think that explains
it]

Is it possible to playback videos with such accuracy? I'm guessing I'd have
to (say) issue a time-code to all devices every so often, and have them
re-sync themselves if they've lost sync.

I don't even know where to start with this tbh. It's a lot more low-level
than I'm used to where iOS/MonoTouch development is concerned.

Does anyone have any ideas of how this could be achieved with MonoTouch? Is
this kinda of accuray even possible?

Cheers
