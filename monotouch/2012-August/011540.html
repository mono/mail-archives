<PRE>Rodrigo,

Thanks for your answer. I use some web views in my application which I initialize and put onto my ViewControllers view. After that I'm basically done with them and don't reference them in code again in the lifecycle of that screen. They're just there for showing information. I'm fairly new to this, so I'm wondering when to dispose them? Straight after putting them into the view in LoadView? Or is there another moment I can get rid of them and any other controls when theyre added to the view (I'm using Xib-less screens)?

I also use an AVPreview and AVStillImageOutput to take a picture in my app, which takes up quite some memory. Not sure how I could optimize the memory usage of that screen, which is, by far the heaviest in load. Especially on my iPhone 3GS testdevice, it's quite a memorydrainer.

Regards,

Steven

&gt;<i> I think the best way to look into this is that your App should not need to handle memory warnings.
</I>&gt;<i> If it receives one, it might be too late to do anything.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The way to handle it is the same of keeping your memory usage down. Explicitly dispose
</I>&gt;<i> all your large objects as soon as you're done with them. Pay special attention to webviews,
