<PRE>Greetings of the day.

I have a situation which I'll try to describe in details in the next few
paragraphs.
In my ipad application, I have images for an assembly [like cranes,
crawlers, loaders, forklifts, backhoe, excavator etc] stored as byte arrays
in my sqlite database. On my view controller, I have a tableview enlisting
the different assemblies available. There are several buttons with different
functionalities one of which is a 'View Photographs' button. When I make a
selection from the tableview and click on this button, all the images of
that particular assembly are supposed to be presented in a sleek, stylish
pop up gallery with option for moving front and back [like we have the
lightbox and other such galleries in asp.net]. I don't want to navigate to
an entirely new view controller for the purpose of presenting the images.
Hence the idea of a pop up gallery. I hope you understand what I'm trying to
create.
Kindly see attached image for ease of understanding.

Now I have figured out the part regarding fetching the byte arrays from
database and converting them back to uiimage type.

What I don't know is how to present the set of images in the form of a pop
up gallery that I mentioned above.
I am relatively new to IOS development. As such having problems implementing
this in my sample application. That's why I turned to the forums for
technical help. Kindly help me by proving some links to useful articles or
tutorials or better still some target specific code blocks. You can also PM
me if you would like to correspond with me through email.

Look forward eagerly to receiving some technical help on this matter in the
earnest.

Many Thanks in anticipation.
