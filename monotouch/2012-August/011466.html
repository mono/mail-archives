<PRE>Hi All,

This process is getting very frustrating, I am now using TestFlightApp to get my betas out to users, to say this process is flaky is an understatement, to simplify things I have only one provisioning profile and one development profile, I have one user that just cannot get his device to register via the TestFlightApp email, but that is not the one I am getting really upset about it is my iPhone that now does not have permission to install the latest beta it is included in both profiles, but clicking on the email from testfightapp I just get back the message &quot;this device cannot install this item&quot;, in testflightapp it is not one of the permitted devices, I have removed all the profiles and rebuilt them and only two devices show up as permitted.

I have wasted another 4 hours going round in circles, tell me I am doing something wrong or is this what I can expect from developing IOS applications because if that is the case I am ready to throw in the towel and drop IOS development, I just feel that apple have locked this stuff up so tight that it is almost unusable.

Thanks

Alex
