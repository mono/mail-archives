<PRE>&gt;<i> So parse.exe would be something like generator.exe in MA Java Binding
</I>&gt;<i> Projects?
</I>&gt;<i> Scans jars and generates cs??
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry If question is stupid, but I'm trying to draw a parallel between MT
</I>&gt;<i> and MA binding process...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> @Nic: can I try it out (parse.exe) ?
</I>
Yes. parse takes a .h file and throws out a .cs file. From memory,
it's usually about 80% right, which saves a LOT of typing.

I guess it's like generator, tho I've not used it.

And yes, you can use it - it's just part of mono :)

&gt;<i> Another one: guys how much man-hours were necessary for initial binding of
</I>&gt;<i> whole MonoTouch?
</I>
Someone like Miguel, Rolf, Sebastien or JonP would need to answer
that- I think it was done over a fair bit of time tho, so it might be
hard to measure, as the core stuff was being done and stabilised at
the same time.

Usually, changes to the api's (ios6b1 to b2) takes 24-48 hours,
depending on their other workload. I think the iOS6 stuff took a week
or 3, but once it's done, it's just smaller changes and testing after
that.


&gt;<i> If there is no tool like sharpen (or results cannot be used like here), this
</I>&gt;<i> was humongous job.
</I>
Oh yes. Parse helps a lot, I think, then the rest is more about making
it look like c# - properties, etc
