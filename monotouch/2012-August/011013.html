<PRE>I want to do debugging on device due to some function is only work on device
such as email, but some issue there. It is work on before, but seems not
work after MonoTouch(paid) was upgraded.

When the app was running on &quot;Debug|iPhone&quot; mode, it is deployed on my iPod
Touch well, and the screen popup an dialog shows &quot;Waiting for debugger to
connect&quot;. On the other, &quot;Deploy to Device&quot; shows log for me that it is all
well done:

/Developer/MonoTouch/usr/bin/mtouch -sdkroot &quot;/Developer&quot; -installdev
&quot;/Users/my_name/Documents/develop/projects/my_project.app&quot;
Please ensure your device is connected...
Connected to: My Name&#8217;s iPod
Initializing file service...
Uploading application
Finalizing file service...
Installing application
Installed application

After a few seconds, the app icon is appeared on my device(I totally deleted
the early version of the app before), and the app is auto start-up on the
device. The app is operating, but...

1. The popup dialog &quot;Waiting for debugger to connect&quot; is still there (in
block mode, I can't place cursor on code editor at the moment).
2. All break point does not take effect while the app is executing through
that break point.
3. The popup dialog will stay along, even I kill the app process from debug.
Until I press &quot;Cancel&quot; button to get it off.

Please help.

Diviner.
