<PRE>Hi All,

My first app is a program that has been quite successful on windows, so a port over to IOS is the next logical step. Firstly this application uses Sqlite, on first run it looks for the database, I could create a blank database if one is not there but there is a quite a lot of initial data the database needs to run so it would be better that I bundle a default database into the application, is this permitted within the guidelines?.

I need to share the folder that the database is in so that it is visible in iTunes, I have this working perfectly, the idea is simple the user can copy their windows based database via iTunes and use this instead of the one on the device, this means the user can work seamlessly between windows and the device moving the whole database, this idea works perfectly for me, is this permitted within the guidelines?

Last but not least, I have working the following, emails sent to the device that have attachments with a very specific extension fire up the application, and import that data directly into the database, the attachments could be made by a number of different processes, e.g. other uses of the program on other devices, then emailed to other users, is this permitted within the guidelines?

I am just about to start rolling out my app to a number of testers and don't want to provide features that will get stripped out after failing approval?

is there anything I am missing that I need to get up to speed?

Thanks.

ATB

Alex
