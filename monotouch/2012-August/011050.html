<PRE>Hi

This is what I get on Mountain Lion:

Steps:

 1. clean install Mountain Lion
 2. XCode 4.4 installed
 3. MonoDevelop 3.0.3.4 installed (in log it says it is absent?!)
 4. MonoTouch (newest downloadaed - I guess 5.2.12) installation fails
    during MonoDevelop installation

Excerpt from Log:

This looks suspicious - casing monodevelop vs MonoDevelop

On my Lion:
mc:~ moljac$ ls -al 
/Applications/MonoDevelop.app/Contents/MacOS/MonoDevelop
-rwxr-xr-x  1 moljac  admin  23104 Jul 16 21:44 
/Applications/MonoDevelop.app/Contents/MacOS/MonoDevelop

I don't have Mountain Lion right now, but as soon as I get back to it 
I'll check paths and casing.

regards

mel
