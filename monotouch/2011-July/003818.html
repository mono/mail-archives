<PRE>My two cents ...
&#160;
Would love to see close integration between Objective-C and Monotouch. Would
like to pick up a Objective-C library project and use it from Monotouch and the
other way round without all the b-touch stuff. Maybe Mono Develop could automate
all that. I think MonoDroid does something like that with java classes. &#160;
&#160;
One of the missing areas is third party controls - It would be awesome if folks
like Telerik, Infragistics, etc. would write controls that Enterprise developers
could buy that are supported. Telerik's feedback on this was their controls were
XAML based and Winforms based and iOS API was very different. If we could have a
subset of XAML support in XTouch and XDroid, this would greatly help vendors and
others to port their controls. Yeah, I know this is not native UI but IT
managers just want working cross platform apps :-(
&#160;
Get Google to add XDroid runtime to Android 4 distribution. This would reduce
the size of final app. &#160;&#160;
&#160;
WCF APIs - Parts of WCF and Windows Identity APIs are not implemented. It would
make sense to invest effort here to make this more enterprise friendly. I would
expect the Enterprise/IT .NET developers is where you can charge more and make
more money. And we want you guys to make more money :-)&#160; &#160;
&#160;
Pricing -&#160; Telerik's pricing model is a good model. Charge more for extra
support and package products together. It's easier to get one approval to buy
$999 product, rather than 2-3 approvals.&#160;
&#160;
Activation - I understand the use of activation but it's bad choice for the
user. None of the .NET component vendors do this.&#160; &#160; &#160;
&#160;
Miguel/Nat - It would make sense to capture this feedback into something like
<A HREF="http://uservoice.com">http://uservoice.com</A> and let people vote on it.
&#160;
Thx,
Ash &#160;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What's on your wishlist for Xamarin's new suite of products?&#160; What was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; missing from MT/MD that you'd really like to see included with the new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; toolset?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here are my top 4...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more consistent communication.&#160; This bugged the heck out of me with MT.&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Some releases were mentioned on Miguel's blog.&#160; Or on his other blog.&#160; Or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the MT homepage.&#160; Occasionally, but rarely, on the mailing list.&#160; Often the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only way I found out about them was when I started MonoDevelop and it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; notified me.&#160; So I'd really like to see a more consistent mechanism for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; notifying us of releases and changes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more value-adds.&#160; Incorporate tools like MonoTouch.Dialog into the core
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; product.&#160; Create more tools like this that help make development faster and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; easier.&#160; .NET developers are used to a really rich ecosystem of third party
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; controls, libraries and tools - in comparison the iOS ecosystem seems pretty
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; barren.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more examples and samples.&#160; Create a lot more code samples that show how to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do common tasks, or exercise new features of the API.&#160; Create more reference
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; applications.&#160; I've yet to see a good universal app written in MT that shows
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; off how to leverage both iPhone and iPad UI in a single app.&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more community - MT had/has a great community - which is probably the only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thing that has kept us going during the current crisis.&#160; Be sure to foster
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and encourage this as Xamarin launches.&#160; Some of us have been evangelizing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MT at user groups and in blogs - help us continue to do this with Xamarin.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What's on your list?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; JA
