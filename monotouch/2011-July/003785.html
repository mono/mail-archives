<PRE>It appears that Attachmate reamed us good.

1. Currently doing that. I had actually finished uni this semester just
been, and myself and a friend are making a startup company. So we planned to
buy a commercial licence (first app we have clients for would pay for that).
But now whats the point if MonoTouch will die as soon as iOS5 SDK is
released. Also, had a BIG app for McDonalds which all my superiors at work
were quite excited about..

2. On student licence you get unlimited ad-hoc deployments. Will stick with
the sim for now.

3. I really dont mind waiting to pay for the XamTouch licence. I hope the
beta will let us deploy to the app store... though I doubt that it will.

They didnt point me as such to them, they said I should contact them because
most MonoTouch employees are now there, and they may be able to help me. I
doubt they have access to the monotouch licence database anymore.
