You are assuming that there are class action cases worth tens of millions all over the place. There are actually a lot of less then rich lawyers because they have to compete for the same cases; I can't see a lawyer choosing to starve then accept a $20k+ paycheck for a month or two worth of actual work, but then again I'm not a lawyer and they might choose the principle of begging on the street then work for less then a certain amount.
Just think of the lawyers who take a case of medical malpractice worth $10k to $15k; if they had soo many million dollar cases, they would constantly turn down those &quot;low profile&quot; cases. It's like a software developer never working for less then $40 an hour and choosing to get food stamps instead because the good paying jobs are gone; this is rarely the case, and people always take less then thrilling jobs while hoping for something better.

not even a bad lawyer would be interested in a class action with a $40k liability.  They're interested in cases in the tens of millions.
I'm as pissed as anyone at Attachmate, but suing them is just going to make the lawyers richer, and give you an ulcer in the process.

At this point I'm content to wait and see what Xamarin comes up with.

Does anyone know a good class action lawyer that would be interested in pursuing Attachmate to get some of the license fees refunded to current paid owners? I bet their is at least $40k worth of licensing that Attachmate is not supporting per the purchase terms. This is especially pertinent to those that are having license activation problems and cannot even use the deployment portion of the IDE.
