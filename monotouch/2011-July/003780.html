<PRE>Hey, 
Been trying to contact monotouch for several weeks now, and contacting
novell by phone and it seems no one is able to help me.

Issue:
Have a monotouch student licence which I have activated on two machines. I
now want to clear the licence off both of these machines because I no longer
have them, but I now have a new mac.
This has happened to me in the past after I had re-installed OSX, and I
contacted email support and they cleared on of my activations so I can
re-activate, so I know this can be done.

Problem:
<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monotouch">monotouch at novell.com</A> never gets back to me. The support email addresses I
had previously all used now just bounce my message back to me.
To add more salt to the wound, MonoTouch does not exist in the Novell Mono
store
(<A HREF="http://shop.novell.com/store/novell/DisplayCategoryProductListPage/categoryID.31946100">http://shop.novell.com/store/novell/DisplayCategoryProductListPage/categoryID.31946100</A>)
and when I contacted them they said that Novell does not deal with MonoTouch
anymore...

So what do? Did I just spend $99 on a student licence which only lasted me 6
months?...
Does MonoTouch still exist? Is it still being developed... I would hope so,
with MT4 recently...
Is MonoTouch made by the same people who made Mono for Android? Maybe I
should contact them.

Does anyone have any ideas of what I should do? I fear if I buy a $400
licence that it simply will take my money, but sure, I'll get that back in
time, but thats not the point.

Novell also pointed me to Xamarin (<A HREF="http://xamarin.com/">http://xamarin.com/</A>)... Is this the new
MonoTouch...?
