<PRE>Congratulations, you got rogered by Attachmate. If you have a lawyer in the family you may want to get them to write a nastygram or two, but you're probably hosed on your $99. Be glad you hadn't forked over $400 for MT-iOS and $199 MT-Android only to not have a viable product, or $999 for a corporate license, or lost out on tens of thousands of dollars of contract work due to lack of development platform support. They should just replace their MT website with a big picture of the Fark.com colonial &quot;Ha-ha&quot; guy (&quot;Ha-ha! We stole your money and there's nothing you can do about it. Sit and spin, suckers.&quot;)

Keep an eye on Xamarin.com - they will soon have the cure for your iOS+C# blues. In the meantime, check out Objective-C - it's not THAT bad*.

&gt;<i> Hey, 
</I>&gt;<i> Been trying to contact monotouch for several weeks now, and contacting
</I>&gt;<i> novell by phone and it seems no one is able to help me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Issue:
</I>&gt;<i> Have a monotouch student licence which I have activated on two machines. I
</I>&gt;<i> now want to clear the licence off both of these machines because I no longer
</I>&gt;<i> have them, but I now have a new mac.
</I>&gt;<i> This has happened to me in the past after I had re-installed OSX, and I

</I>&gt;<i> re-activate, so I know this can be done.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Problem:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monotouch">monotouch at novell.com</A> never gets back to me. The support email addresses I
</I>&gt;<i> had previously all used now just bounce my message back to me.
</I>&gt;<i> To add more salt to the wound, MonoTouch does not exist in the Novell Mono
</I>&gt;<i> store
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://shop.novell.com/store/novell/DisplayCategoryProductListPage/categoryID.31946100">http://shop.novell.com/store/novell/DisplayCategoryProductListPage/categoryID.31946100</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> and when I contacted them they said that Novell does not deal with MonoTouch
</I>&gt;<i> anymore...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So what do? Did I just spend $99 on a student licence which only lasted me 6
</I>&gt;<i> months?...
</I>&gt;<i> Does MonoTouch still exist? Is it still being developed... I would hope so,
</I>&gt;<i> with MT4 recently...
</I>&gt;<i> Is MonoTouch made by the same people who made Mono for Android? Maybe I
</I>&gt;<i> should contact them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone have any ideas of what I should do? I fear if I buy a $400
</I>&gt;<i> licence that it simply will take my money, but sure, I'll get that back in
</I>&gt;<i> time, but thats not the point.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Novell also pointed me to Xamarin (<A HREF="http://xamarin.com/">http://xamarin.com/</A>)... Is this the new
</I>&gt;<i> MonoTouch...?
