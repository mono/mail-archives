<PRE>Hi Fabrizio,

You can write the UI programming it, as maybe many ppl are doing, or you can
write it on Interface Builder as I'm doing. It's not so flexible as Visual
Studio because things aren't made automatic as on Visual Studio but, for me,
is possible to create View Controllers called FormSomething as the same name
as each Form on my Windows Mobile project that is being ported to iOS. So I
have codes really close each other. Also &quot;controls&quot; I name is as the same
name, like textBoxSomething or buttonSomething. UITables I call it
listViewSomething (lol). There is no ComboBox but I create a class called
ComboBox with same methods than windows to call inserts, selected value etc
like windows to use UIPicker. You can to use Extensions to get some extra
methods that you have on windows inside iOS &quot;controls&quot;.

BTW I recommend to read books like Professional iPhone Programming with
Monotouch and .NET/C# by Wallace B. McClure and other smart guys. That was
really importatnt to me to do things and is important yet, 7 months since
beginning of development. There is a new book also on Amazon but I didn't
has Kindle version yet.

Subject:  Re: [MonoTouch] Newbie in Mono from .Net platform

hallo im new in the apple wolrld to.
but im now developing an app for my client that has some similar
requirments,
i my aproach to solve the problem is that on the server side we export the
reqired objects to an sqlite service and the rqired files to an compressed
file
on the client side i use JASON for the communication with the server
i save the needet content on the local machine so long as it is rquired or
just as far as the next content will reqired.
But im far away from this point of the implementation now im combating with
the cocoa framework to become the UI that I would have and here i have big
troubls.
In the MS world i can design the UI how i wold have but here is a big
difference, the aproach is totaly different.

I Wish your al the best an good luck fo r your APP

Fabrizio P.
