<PRE>What's on your wishlist for Xamarin's new suite of products?  What was
missing from MT/MD that you'd really like to see included with the new
toolset?

Here are my top 4...

   - more consistent communication.  This bugged the heck out of me with MT.
    Some releases were mentioned on Miguel's blog.  Or on his other blog.  Or
   the MT homepage.  Occasionally, but rarely, on the mailing list.  Often the
   only way I found out about them was when I started MonoDevelop and it
   notified me.  So I'd really like to see a more consistent mechanism for
   notifying us of releases and changes.


   - more value-adds.  Incorporate tools like MonoTouch.Dialog into the core
   product.  Create more tools like this that help make development faster and
   easier.  .NET developers are used to a really rich ecosystem of third party
   controls, libraries and tools - in comparison the iOS ecosystem seems pretty
   barren.


   - more examples and samples.  Create a lot more code samples that show
   how to do common tasks, or exercise new features of the API.  Create more
   reference applications.  I've yet to see a good universal app written in MT
   that shows off how to leverage both iPhone and iPad UI in a single app.


   - more community - MT had/has a great community - which is probably the
   only thing that has kept us going during the current crisis.  Be sure to
   foster and encourage this as Xamarin launches.  Some of us have been
   evangelizing MT at user groups and in blogs - help us continue to do this
   with Xamarin.


What's on your list?

JA
