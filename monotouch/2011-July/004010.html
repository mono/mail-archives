<PRE>I'm a little confused about Apple and MonoTouch licensing in my particular
situation.

My company is developing an app for a third party using MonoTouch.  Our
client intends to distribute their application using Apple's enterprise
distribution method.  My understanding is that my client needs to get an
enterprise development license from Apple for distribution.   However, which
of us would be purchasing the MonoTouch license?  I would assume my company
would purchase that license, since we're the ones doing the development, but
our client wants to be responsible for distribution of the application to
their iPhones using their company name.  If we purchase an enterprise
license for MonoTouch, can we build apps for our client and sign them using
the client's keys and provisioning and etc., or will that result in the apps
having our company name on them?

I'm new to development with Apple if you couldn't tell, so if my question is
unclear, please let me know and I'll see if I can clarify.
