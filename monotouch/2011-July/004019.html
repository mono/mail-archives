<PRE>&gt;<i> My question here isn't so much about who pays for it, so much as who owns
</I>&gt;<i> it. &#160;Let me try and clarify. &#160;My client wants to distribute their app with
</I>&gt;<i> their enterprise license of MonoTouch. &#160;So I build their app and sign it
</I>&gt;<i> with their license.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
whoever pays for it, owns it. Eg:

you pay apple and xamarin. you own it all (except maybe the (C) of the
app, depending on your local law)

They pay apple, and you pay xamarin. they control the distribution,
you keep the licenses when the project finishes.

they pay both. They let you use it. once the project is done, they
would most likely require you to remove monotouch from your machines.

it depends on your arrangement. As long as you have

1 apple certificate (I think, I dont think it's per developer)
1 monotouch enterprise license per developer

..... neither apple nor xamarin should care.


&gt;<i> Time passes and now I've got a new client and I want to build apps for them
</I>&gt;<i> using their enterprise license, but with the MonoTouch license I bought
</I>&gt;<i> before.
</I>
See above. If YOU bought it, you own the MT license, so it's all good.
If client A bought the MT license, and has removed your permission to
use it, then you have to go out and buy a new license.

one thing to remember: apple enterprise licenses dont allow appstore
use, so just be aware of that

&gt;<i> In my mind, I'm seeing MonoTouch like any other development tool
</I>&gt;<i> (Infragistics, Telerik, etc.) where I buy the tool and then I can build apps
</I>&gt;<i> for pretty much anyone I want. &#160;Is this the case with MonoTouch? &#160;Based on
</I>&gt;<i> the above, do I even need an enterprise license as long as my client has an
</I>&gt;<i> enterprise license with Apple?
</I>
That would be my take. You pay for the tools, and unless you contract
that away, you own it.

To use the non-appstore distribution, you need an enterprise license. Actually:

1. trial: sim only
2. student: sim + your own developer devices (no appstore)
3. pro: sim + your own devices + appstore
4. enterprise: sim + own devices + the enterprirse appstore thing + appstore.

So apple is different (based on this:
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/enterprise/">http://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/enterprise/</A> ) - enterprise is
enterprise only (no appstore).
