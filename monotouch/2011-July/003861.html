<PRE>For me it's actually moot, being my updates expired about 3 days
before the whole thing went down....

&gt;<i> Class action suits work differently then regular suits. In the few I've been in, all I had to do was fill out a form which took ten minutes, wait 8 months, and received a check for the settlement amount. The lawyers make the money from the overall quantity of those that sign on and in many cases they force the defendant to pay there fee for making us take them to court, thus getting the full refund back for the clients they represent. Attach mate also broke their end of a contract, so they wouldn't be in a position to control if it is credit or not. That would be like you canceling a cell phone contract, then simply giving them some of your unwanted stuff of equal value to what is owed rather then paying any fees. Even if the license terms stipulate that we donated the fee to them and they were not obligated to provide anything in return, it would take a very crooked judge to agree that those terms are not fraudulent and unreasonable
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The biggest risk would involve the amount of people that sign on to the suit, which would immediately relate to the amount of a return a firm can expect to get paid for winning. They would look over the case and it's likely chance of winning, then if they found it to be in the client's favor they would poll how many individuals are interested in signing on. Anyone with the time to read these lists is not so busy coding that they can't fill out a form, but the risk is still there that not many people care about a couple hundred dollars. That's the whole push behind mail in rebates, a company rarely gets concerned of paying for them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, I don't know any class action firms, so it's a null point. I'm hoping someone else does, though.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> not even a bad lawyer would be interested in a class action with a $40k
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> liability. &#160;They're interested in cases in the tens of millions.
