My question here isn't so much about who pays for it, so much as who owns
it.  Let me try and clarify.  My client wants to distribute their app with
their enterprise license of MonoTouch.  So I build their app and sign it
with their license.

Time passes and now I've got a new client and I want to build apps for them
using their enterprise license, but with the MonoTouch license I bought
before.

In my mind, I'm seeing MonoTouch like any other development tool
(Infragistics, Telerik, etc.) where I buy the tool and then I can build apps
for pretty much anyone I want.  Is this the case with MonoTouch?  Based on
the above, do I even need an enterprise license as long as my client has an
enterprise license with Apple?
