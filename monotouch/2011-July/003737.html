<PRE>Hi

I am soon shipping our first iPad app using MonoTouch, and are still experiencing some crashes that might be related to memory handling. Some of it seem to somehow relate to the thread &quot;100 times Adding / removing a View + backgroundImage will always crash !&quot;

Once in a while my app crashes, typically flipping a lot back and forth between detailview controllers in the UISplitViewController, sometime when returning from UIImagePickerController (picture taken with camera), and sometimes when the iPad has been laying around for long time (e.g. overnight).

I can't seem to find anything in crash logs or instruments that make me much wiser.

So thinking the using and IDisposable pattern could be some of the trouble.

So my question is this - when is it advisable to use &quot;using&quot;, and when should the garbage collector be able to handle it.

For now I have all UIImages as using. But stuff like UITableViewCell, UIAlertViews (which I would need a ref to - so &quot;using&quot; is not good here - but could dispose them manually), UIImagePickerController, UIBarButton etc. is not disposed by me.

So basically all I am disposing myself is the UIImages.

Should I e.g dispose UITableViewCells once added to a UITableview - even though they run out of scope a few lines later?

I hope some of you might have some good advice/experience on this

Best regards
/Anders
