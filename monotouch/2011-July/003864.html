My 2 cents;

A lawsuit has no point as Attachmate can just honour their years support and
&quot;upgrades&quot; (they didn't promise any upgrades anyway) and then shut the
project down.

This is a risk we all take when buying anything... Let's just move on and
hope that Xamarin have something for us to play with again soon!

Regards,

James

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And to be honest, I'd rather write apps than try to get compensation.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; not even a bad lawyer would be interested in a class action with a $40k
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; liability.  They're interested in cases in the tens of millions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I'm as pissed as anyone at Attachmate, but suing them is just going to
</I>&gt;<i> make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the lawyers richer, and give you an ulcer in the process.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; At this point I'm content to wait and see what Xamarin comes up with.
