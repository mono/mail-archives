<PRE>Excellent post!

This is my list:

1. Documentation, documentation, documentation! Tired seeing &quot;Documentation for this item has not yet been entered&quot; (or whatever).
2. Support. Stackoverflow is nice, but not enough. If this means that I have to pay more for the product, so be it. I am willing to do that as long as I know I will get a solution.
3. Community tools: mailing lists do not bring more people, forums do.

On the technical side, I'd love a linker whitelist and blacklist on types, instead of Do not link - SDK only - All assemblies. But I do not know how easy this would be.

&gt;<i> What's on your wishlist for Xamarin's new suite of products?  What was missing from MT/MD that you'd really like to see included with the new toolset?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here are my top 4...
</I>&gt;<i> more consistent communication.  This bugged the heck out of me with MT.  Some releases were mentioned on Miguel's blog.  Or on his other blog.  Or the MT homepage.  Occasionally, but rarely, on the mailing list.  Often the only way I found out about them was when I started MonoDevelop and it notified me.  So I'd really like to see a more consistent mechanism for notifying us of releases and changes.
</I>&gt;<i> more value-adds.  Incorporate tools like MonoTouch.Dialog into the core product.  Create more tools like this that help make development faster and easier.  .NET developers are used to a really rich ecosystem of third party controls, libraries and tools - in comparison the iOS ecosystem seems pretty barren.
</I>&gt;<i> more examples and samples.  Create a lot more code samples that show how to do common tasks, or exercise new features of the API.  Create more reference applications.  I've yet to see a good universal app written in MT that shows off how to leverage both iPhone and iPad UI in a single app.  
</I>&gt;<i> more community - MT had/has a great community - which is probably the only thing that has kept us going during the current crisis.  Be sure to foster and encourage this as Xamarin launches.  Some of us have been evangelizing MT at user groups and in blogs - help us continue to do this with Xamarin.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What's on your list?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> JA
