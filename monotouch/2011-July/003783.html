<PRE>First up, here's what I've been recommending for a while:

1. Get the trial from monotouch.net, so you can dev in the simulator.

2. If you need to deploy onto a device, get hold of someone here (eg
me) and we'll try to arrange a ad-hoc build so you can put it on your
device (I think you get one device with a student version?). Eg if you
need to get it on a device for an end-of-semester project or
something. If it's just you hacking around, stick with the sim for the
moment.

3. Ignore MonoTouch otherwise - Attachmate bought Novell, and fired
all the developers (ie, Miguel, Joseph, Geoff, Michael and all the
others). They then formed Xamarin to make what I'm calling XamTouch
(and XamDroid, and maybe XamWebOS or XamBerry or XamSomethingElse),
tho I seriously doubt they will call it that.

Once they have XamTouch out, you will need to re-purchase a student
license - it's a separate company, and I wouldn't expect them to give
a discount for existing users. Actually, I hope they don't - I'd
rather they had MORE money to make MORE kick arse tools for me to use
:<i>) Selfish? yes. I can deal with that :)
</I>
For more info, keep an eye on Miguel's blog: <A HREF="http://tirania.org/blog/">http://tirania.org/blog/</A>
especially:

<A HREF="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2011/Jun-28.html">http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2011/Jun-28.html</A>
<A HREF="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2011/May-25.html">http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2011/May-25.html</A>
<A HREF="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2011/May-16.html">http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2011/May-16.html</A>

With the usual disclaimers of &quot;I dont have any inside knowledge&quot;,
Miguel said that a release of XamTouch would be out (at least in beta,
if not for purchase) &quot;in 3 months&quot; from mid-May (I think - can't
remember if it was 2-3 or 3-4). They have a lot of it working already
by the looks of it.

And now the funny bit:

&quot;Novell also pointed me to Xamarin (<A HREF="http://xamarin.com/">http://xamarin.com/</A>)... Is this
the new MonoTouch...?&quot;

WTF? That's like calling Microsoft about SQL Server and having them
say &quot;oh, maybe you should call Oracle...&quot; :)

Cheers

Nic

&gt;<i> Hey,
</I>&gt;<i> Been trying to contact monotouch for several weeks now, and contacting
</I>&gt;<i> novell by phone and it seems no one is able to help me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Issue:
</I>&gt;<i> Have a monotouch student licence which I have activated on two machines. I
</I>&gt;<i> now want to clear the licence off both of these machines because I no longer
</I>&gt;<i> have them, but I now have a new mac.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Problem:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monotouch">monotouch at novell.com</A> never gets back to me. The support email addresses I
</I>&gt;<i> had previously all used now just bounce my message back to me.
</I>&gt;<i> To add more salt to the wound, MonoTouch does not exist in the Novell Mono
</I>&gt;<i> store
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://shop.novell.com/store/novell/DisplayCategoryProductListPage/categoryID.31946100">http://shop.novell.com/store/novell/DisplayCategoryProductListPage/categoryID.31946100</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> and when I contacted them they said that Novell does not deal with MonoTouch
</I>&gt;<i> anymore...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So what do? Did I just spend $99 on a student licence which only lasted me 6
</I>&gt;<i> months?...
</I>&gt;<i> Does MonoTouch still exist? Is it still being developed... I would hope so,
</I>&gt;<i> with MT4 recently...
</I>&gt;<i> Is MonoTouch made by the same people who made Mono for Android? Maybe I
</I>&gt;<i> should contact them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone have any ideas of what I should do? I fear if I buy a $400
</I>&gt;<i> licence that it simply will take my money, but sure, I'll get that back in
</I>&gt;<i> time, but thats not the point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Novell also pointed me to Xamarin (<A HREF="http://xamarin.com/">http://xamarin.com/</A>)... Is this the new
</I>&gt;<i> MonoTouch...?
