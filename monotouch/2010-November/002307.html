<PRE>Phone/Monotouch Contract Developer
The Go Game

The Go Game stages technology-fueled, creative games and activities for team
building, marketing programs, sales training and just pure fun. Based in San
Francisco, we stage unique, interactive events and scavenger hunts for
groups of 3 to 10,000 players anywhere in the world.

Right now we are developing an iPhone-based platform to bring customizable,
real-time, location-based, live scavenger-hunt games to the general public.
The client platform is being developed in Monotouch, in tandem with a Ruby
On Rails-based web application.

Go Game Orbiter brings the fun back to location-based games.  It&#8217;s is the
only game in town that&#8217;s all about you and your friends and can be quickly
customized to suit any occasion that calls for a party.  And, unlike other
games that make you write the game yourself, we&#8217;ve done all the work for
you, scouting out galleries and bars, devising devastatingly clever clues
and scripting a range of hilarious interactions that will suit any
occasion.  Got a Bachelorette party coming up? No problem.  Company offsite?
Done. Birthday Party. We&#8217;ve done thousands of them. That&#8217;s because The Go
Game has been building location games since 2001.  It&#8217;s what we do and we
know how to make them fun.

We are looking for an experienced iPhone developer to help us get Go Game
Orbiter into the hands of players before Spring 2011. This is a short-term
contract position (2-6 months) with the potential for more work down the
line.

Ideal candidates will have developed and shipped one or more Monotouch-based
iPhone applications, but Objective-C iPhone developers who also have C# or
Java experience are certainly welcome.
