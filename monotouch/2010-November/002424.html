<PRE>Hi there,
I have an app that depending on the db I put in it, I have different names
and icons for it. in xcode I used multiple targets and each could have their
own set of files and settings.
I tried to move all my common classes into a dll and have multiple projects
with different settings referencing the same dll. however, it seems that MT
apps don't like to load xibs from another dll. I get this error when loading
my UI: NSInternalInconsistencyException Reason: Could not load NIB in bundle

Up until now I have thought of two approaches that I don't like and was
wondering if someone can think of a third approach?

1. have multiple configurations for multiple products and then use Custom
commands to insert the correct display name and icon name in the .csproj xml
file before compile. I'm not sure if this even works. but even if id does, I
would end up with A LOT of configurations 6 for each product name to be
precise. (Debug vs release vs distribution X iphone vs simulator)

2. I can (can I?) reference the same files from different projects. each of
which is going to be one of my products and the only difference will be the
settings for display name and icon files. this approach can be nightmare
for maintenance as I have to add new files to all of the projects every time
I need to add something to the app.

Any help would be appreciated.
Cheers,
Al
