<PRE>Yeah, I've had a terrible time with the app approval process, this also for
an update to an app that had already been approved. What really pisses me
off, is that you don't get an itemized list of all the problems (in their
eyes). Instead you might get a couple of things, so you fix, send it back in
thinking everything's gravy, and then get hit by some other things. They are
wasting our time just as much as their own by doing this, as it may take
several submissions before everything is great in their eyes. 

I've never had so much trouble in getting an app through the app process
before. If only there was another viable platform to Apple, I'd dump it in a
second if there was.
