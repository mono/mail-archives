<PRE>I've got big problem. My app, that is due to go live tomorrow, is crashing at
random. It crashes in different views, and at different points. It doesn't
actually crash the app - the app just sits there, not responding. It
literally just sat there for 24 minutes, until I allowed the screen to go
off (I kept tapping the screen to keep it awake). Then, when re-starting the
app, it closed itself within 30 seconds. The next time I run the app,
everything is fine.

There doesn't appear to be any pattern to it, although I'm starting to think
it could be something to do with the UIWebView, or me not dealing with low
memory correctly (but I can't think of anything else to do).

I've spent days googling and trying various things, including:

Promoting key private variables to class variables (to prevent premature GC)
Turning off phone number detection (I found an article that suggested it
might be bugged)
Making sure all objects are disposed of cleanly
(needlessly) Completely rewriting sections of code (at one point, it looked
like a LINQ query was the problem, so I rewrote it to not employ LINQ at
all)
Etc etc etc.

&gt;<i>From the iPad's console, I see this (client name and app name removed):

Mar  1 22:46:33 unknown SpringBoard[15] &lt;Warning&gt;: Application '&lt;removed&gt;'
exited abnormally with signal 9: Killed: 9

I don't even get a crash report at the time it locks up (which makes sense,
as the app hasn't crashed out). I get a crash report if I let the screen go
off, and the unlock the device (that I can post if it would help).

Can anyone suggest what might be the problem? I know it's a big ask but,
after two days of trying to fix the problem without success, I'm fast
running out of time.

Many thanks
