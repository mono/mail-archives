<PRE>I'm using MonoDevelop 2.8.8.1 with MonoTouch 5.2.8 - BETA's as you know.  In
the BETA channel I also have Mono 2.10.9 installed.

This morning I got the e-mail regarding iOS 5.1 and MonoTouch 5.2.5 STABLE
to fix the critical issue - which doesn't affect me thankfully.  I had hoped
that MonoTouch would show STABLE for the release AFTER the beta I'm using
which is 5.2.8 so I was surprised to see a STABLE announcement as 5.2.5.

I switched from the BETA to STABLE channel, which used to be done just by
switching the drop down, now you essentially have to &quot;apply&quot; it in the new
MD (beta) so that took me a minute to figure out.  Once I switched to STABLE
updates started downloading - well, they weren't new versions, but stable
versions, yet I had newer versions installed - problem #1.

Then I restarted MD after the &quot;updates&quot; installed and then the updater was
downloading again.  It keeps downloading Mono 2.10.8 even with 2.10.9
installed - confusing.  Not sure why it's &quot;updating&quot; when a newer version is
installed.

My question now is:  If I'm in the BETA channel - will I still &quot;also&quot; see
STABLE updates available or am I filter to only show BETA channel products? 
I was hoping that by being in the BETA channel it would show me beta and
higher, i.e. both BETA and STABLE updates and I can choose which to install. 
I think the problem is this auto-install system so it's only going to pickup
updates marked as BETA?

I'm guessing then I'm going to have to change out of BETA into STABLE and
regress to get back to being notified of STABLE builds?  I like the way this
used to work before the auto updating so I could choose which to install
based on where I am in development.  At this point I'm ready to release an
update but was hoping for the next MD version with iPad 3 support for image
assignments, etc.

Thank you.

Neal
