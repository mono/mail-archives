<PRE>Hi again John,

I just wanted to let you know that the crash you experienced has been fixed.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and my email address <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monotouch">john at murr</A> etc seems to be registered  so there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not be a moderator queue issue. but these recent posts seem to have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disappeared - they are visible in my emails but not inline on this forum -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so I am replying here
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Okay, I don't know what the issue with the mailing-lists is then :-(
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> .hfiles disappearing - random;y (horrid word to a developer) one could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> click
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on xib file go to xcode/Ib and try to create an outlet - the right hand
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> screen would show something like 'no assistant available' If you looked in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the file/folder list in left hand pane there was not evidence of any *.h
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> file - On the one or tow occasions this happened rebooting everything made
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them come back
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Okay, so sometimes the .h files are generated and sometimes not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess that answers the question I wanted to know from the Chris's...
</I>&gt;<i> this suggests that at least in your case, you have C# classes that
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop should be exporting as ObjC .m/.h files.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is probably happening is that MonoDevelop's Type database for your
</I>&gt;<i> project is incomplete and/or corrupt somehow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If this happens again, try closing MonoDevelop, deleting all the *.pidb
</I>&gt;<i> files in your project, and then reopening your project in MonoDevelop to
</I>&gt;<i> allow it to regenerate them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Simpler than trying to paste everything into a new project :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the meantime, hopefully we can figure out what the problem is with the
</I>&gt;<i> Types database (I wonder if Mike's new parser in the newresolver branch
</I>&gt;<i> fixes this?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - On hte last but one occasion this didnt seem to work so I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> created a brand new project and cut and pasted everything across
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the most recent occasion wass probably mroed in the confusion of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> upgrade
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to xcode 4.3 - the install wipes out monotouch (and my .h files) followed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> same process - start with blank project ceate a view - new *.h appears -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> paste in back up *.h code ( when I say back  up I have a previous version
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the project which has retained its *.h files - I cut and pasted this into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> notes  then line by line added it back into th enew project as I added the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> controls. (only marginally quicker than recreating all the outlets and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was gnawing the wood on the table!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As to the 'hangs'   it is BOTH Xcode and MD  which fail - MD does it more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gracefully . after a session in  xcode copying objects and creating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> outlets
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one saves and quits back to MD the circular progress bar appears Xcode
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not shut down and the progress bar stays there until timeout - If one is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lucky this does not take out MD but on several occasions it does - that's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when one sees the popup aying crash reported to Xamarin - I think it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> during the process when the message on the status bar says#
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 'updating xcode files'
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wrote some fixes to MonoDevelop's code that syncs files back from Xcode
</I>&gt;<i> in cases where new files were added in Xcode which are in the upcoming
</I>&gt;<i> 2.8.8 Stable release. Essentially what I did was to prevent back-and-forth
</I>&gt;<i> syncing with Xcode when importing the new files.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In 2.8.6.x, when a new file is imported from Xcode, it causes a re-sync
</I>&gt;<i> back out to Xcode, and then another re-sync back from Xcode. All of this
</I>&gt;<i> extra AppleScript chatter might be too much for Xcode to handle (Xcode
</I>&gt;<i> seems rather fragile with AppleScript requests), not to mention just makes
</I>&gt;<i> the whole process less efficient. MonoDevelop 2.8.8 should definitely sync
</I>&gt;<i> files back from Xcode faster in cases where new files were added in Xcode.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With any luck, 2.8.8 final should be released to the stable channels by
</I>&gt;<i> next week sometime.
</I>&gt;<i>
