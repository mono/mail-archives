<PRE>Karl,

All of the above!  Even showing a link in a UIAlertView or in a footer of a
UITableView section, or showing an embedded browser (HTML element in
MonoTouch.Dialog).

In my honest opinion, it seems as if they've added more reviewers and the
new recruits do not understand the terms.  It also seems that your review is
like a help desk ticket, it's assigned to a reviewer so even if you try to
play a game and buy some time, it's still going to go back to the same
reviewer.  Makes sense in a way, just unfortunate.

Again, lesson learned is the review process is not your friend.  You better
make sure your app has all your desired features you can think of at the
time of submission, it is fully tested, etc.  When you're ready to submit
the app to apple, wait a week!  Take that week to tinker, to test, to think,
and only when you have nothing to do, submit it!

I think they were trying to bully me into in-app purchasing, however, I'm
confident in the rules of the road, Kindle is the perfect example.  They
removed the &quot;store&quot; button but the app remained unchanged.  Your customers
just have to know where to go to buy items if they are to be used in the
app.  It's a trade-off, sometimes the impulse buy factor of purchasing
in-app is a good thing, it may actually increase the revenue despite the 30%
loss.

Good luck to all, I hope you can learn from my experience.  In two years
I've never had such an experience with Apple.
