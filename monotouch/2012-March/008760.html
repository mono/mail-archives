<PRE>Hi Rodrigo,

 

That&#146;s good news to hear that you are constantly improving memory
management.

 

Would you mind answering/commenting on a few topics related to memory
management?

 

Is it &#132;normal&#147; for Monotouch applications to have an ever growing memory
footprint and (according to Instruments) never seem to drop back to the
initial value, even after a forced GC? Is this effect due to fragmentation
of the heap (I guess even SGen cannot prevent fragmentation 100%)?

 

What I&#146;m also still wondering about: starting a Monotouch app shows
initially 20MB of memory allocated in Instruments and pushing around a view
UIViewControllers makes it grow to 30MB pretty quickly. An ObjC app only
requires about 1MB. As there is not JIT runtime involved in Monotouch, what
else requires so much memory compared to ObjC? Or is Instruments just wrong
(but at least it&#146;s relatively easy to get memory warnings, so it cannot be
all wrong)?

 

Regards,

Ren&#233;

Hi Ren&#233;,

 

We're working on improving our memory management story all the time. Right
now our focus is to make sgen (our new garbage collector)

better fit the kind of workload of MonoTouch and Mono for Android.

 

This means that right now we're not actively working on the new reference
counting code, but be sure it will receive bug fixes if they are

found or reported to us. Once those other features are done we might get
back to it.

 

Regards,

Rodrigo Kumpera

Hi,

 

is the experimental reference counting enhancement still under active
development? I have not read any updates about it.

Is it unchanged since it was introduced or are you always working on it,
enhancing it silently?

 

Ren&#233;
