<PRE>I am having problem getting the correct memory allocation data on iOS
application written using MonoTouch.

I wrote a simple application that periodically adds bunch objects to a list.
After I run Instruments on the app; the total memory allocation is peaked at
2.09MB. This doesn't seem right because I know I allocated more than that.

I kept increasing the number of objects in the list to around 38000 objects;
at that time it looks like iOS automatically kill the app because it reaches
the max limit. The reading for total allocation in Instruments is still
around 2mb.

My question is that is there any setting that I need to set before running
the instrument.

Things that I would like to mention: 
- I tried to build both Release and Debug. 
- I deployed the app to device and run the instrument against it. 
- I have the latest version of Monotouch and Monodevelop 
- I have XCode SDK 5.1 installed.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Thank you much, AA
