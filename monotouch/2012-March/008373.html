<PRE>I've posted before but cant see the posts in the forum (I generally just send
an email to ximian lists) so I presume that's why I dont get any response so
I am trying positng to the forum on the web

I have had problems with .h files disappearing managed to recreate them from
a backup by cuting and pasting  - this is almost the same as Chris_m' s
issue. Right now I have bypassed it by creating a new project and cutting
and pasting - but one shouldnt have to do this its such a time wast
As jeff Stedfast says this impression may be because IB is reindexing - I
have had atleast 6 or 7 'hangs' with Xcode - a pop up says 'could not cloe
Xcode - timeout' when this also affect MD I get another pop up which says
the crash has been reported to Xamarin 

I dared to upgrade to Xcode 4.3 - seeing as how 5.2.5 of MT says it is
compatible - I thought this might solve the endless crashes and unhandled
exceptions 

I have gone back to a previous state of the code which WAS running - it
compiles but when I run it I get 
/Unhandled Exception: MonoTouch.Foundation.MonoTouchException: Objective-C
exception thrown.  Name: NSUnknownKeyException Reason: [&lt;mainview 0x9b281d0&gt;
setValue:forUndefinedKey:]: this class is not key value coding-compliant for
the key radarB.

unknown&gt;:0 [ERROR] FATAL UNHANDLED EXCEPTION:

Name: NSUnknownKeyException Reason: [&lt;mainview 0x9b281d0&gt;
setValue:forUndefinedKey:]: this class is not key value coding-compliant for
the key radarB.
/

The KEY it seems to be complaining about &quot;radarB&quot; is an old button which
used to be on one of my views - long since deleted - clearly some reference
to it remains - I am not completely stupid so of course I have searched
EVERY file I can think of *.cs designer.cs *.h and *.m files and there i sNO
reference to radarB ANYWHERE - I have cleaned the code until I am blue in
the face

I have remmed out all code associated with teh view on which this button
used to appear but still I get this unhandled exception 
Barring creating a new project then tediously copying and pasting all the
code(which is what I did last time and have done about 10 times now) is
there anyway to get rid of this reference ??

Could someone pleeeese help 
JM
