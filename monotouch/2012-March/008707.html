<PRE>I'm a long time Windows user and quite new to Apple &amp; Lion.  As a result I
put MT in the wrong account and now want to correct that.

MT appears on the desktop of the new account and I can start it, and design
a simple program, but when I tell it to run it refuses saying: mtouch exited
with code 98.  I think it's just a little confused about where it is and
where Xcode is.

How to handle this trivial piece of system admin?  I just want to get MT to
run under a new account on the same machine.  It seems silly to install
another (enormous) copy of Xcode.

-------------------

Once I get the simulator to run, the second issue is how to handle testing
on physical devices.  Apple has a diabolically complex procedure to control
use of external iDevices.  Is changing account on the same machine, the same
as moving between different machine? Do I have to export or the permissions
from one account, and import it into the new account?

Thanks any advice on this matter.
