<PRE>I agree 100%. Switching between different version of Monotouch would be
awesome. I have to support the current version of our app using 5.2.5 but
want to continue development for the next release on 5.2.9.
Currently I have to install 5.2.5, make the patched version, then update
again to 5.2.9.

Betreff: [MonoTouch] So, was offered 5.2.9 (beta) as a stable release
yesterday...

...I refused it, but then found the issue previously reported about
breakpoints not working and that was fixed in the latest MD beta. So I
downloaded that + the Mono binaries too. But I didn't download MT 5.2.9 (the
stable 'beta'). Unfortunately my env was hosed, breakpoints weren't lining
up, a complete mess. So I thought Id bite the bullet and upgrade to the
*stable* build of 5.2.9 (beta) thinking there was a dependency. Install said
it worked, but the disc mounter says there was an error, wtf? Checked
versions and I still have 5.2.5 installed.

Long story short, rebooted and Im working again, with MT 5.25 and the latest
beta of MD.

What I want to see changed:
The new upgrade manager shows you what the upgrade is but has no option to
install. You have to close the screen to see the screen we had in previous
releases which allows you to install. Messy.
You need to integrate the screens, hot flip between the current stable,
beta, and alpha releases, allowing you to install alpha, or flip back to
stable (and even previous stable versions). This screen *needs* to highlight
dependencies across the Mono stack, including externals like xcode 4.3 which
I haven't yet upgraded to.

Any thoughts on this? I dont mean for this to sound like a rant, but when I
do mono development I dont have time to be messing around with different
versions. 

Thanks
John
