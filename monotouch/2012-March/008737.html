<PRE>Thanx Nic - that's what I expected.

I have a 4S and a 4 for my testing, my CEO has my 3GS and 3G as well as an iPod Touch and an iPad 2. But the only devices that work with this external hardware are the 4 and 4S, so the others aren't a concern. If they don't have this external hardware, they will never see the area of code that's causing an issue. My CEO can only see it because I added fake code to DEV builds so that he could test without having to steal my hardware.

Cheers,
Dino

Subject: Re: [MonoTouch] iPhone 4 iOS

&gt;<i> Just wondered if anyone knows what version of iOS a new iPhone 4 (not 
</I>&gt;<i> 4S) is likely to come with?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
5.1. Apple always ship with the latest, within 24 hours of it being released. It's quite impressive (same with MacOS)

&gt;<i> We&#8217;re seeing some strange behavior on older versions of iOS but only 
</I>&gt;<i> in an area of our product that requires a sleeve for the iPhone 4/4S, 
</I>&gt;<i> so I&#8217;m not concerned about older devices. And due to our market, our 
</I>&gt;<i> customers are likely to go buy new devices so was trying to get an 
</I>&gt;<i> idea of what might be on them. It originally came out with iOS 4 but I 
</I>&gt;<i> am unsure as to whether new product on the shelves now would have iOS 
</I>&gt;<i> 4 or iOS 5? Do they automatically alter manufacturing to include the 
</I>&gt;<i> latest iOS when it&#8217;s released, or do they stick to the original and force the user to manually upgrade?
</I>
I keep an old iPod Touch (3G) around for this - I have 4.2.1 on it for old version testing. My oldest supported version is now a 3G with 4.2.1. :) And even that is a stretch - iOS5 is SO much nicer.

You might be able to get one off ebay....? Will it work with a touch?
Or maybe JB it and see if you can downgrade it? Tho I think you need to have the keys archived from when it was running that version.
