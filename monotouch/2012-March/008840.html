<PRE>I wouldn't characterize it as fragile - there are many large scale projects
out there sharing massive amounts of code across platforms. And it sure as
heck beats re-writing the code in Objective-C and Java!

&gt;&gt;<i>So now this means I can't do any of that :(
</I>well, no - you can still do *most* of that.

Once you set-up the workflow it should work similarly to how you described
(you can still work on your core and unit tests as you did - however you
need to bring in the dependencies _as code_, so they'll compile in MT &amp;
MD). A &quot;MonoTouch Library Project&quot; isn't some magic thing to be worried
about - it's a regular csproj with a specific project-type-guid that tells
it to compile against the MT profile of .NET that Sebastien mentioned.

&gt;&gt;<i>or i'm now into a world of pain trying to 'port' those repos
</I>Many open-source libraries &quot;just recompile&quot; or else have been forked for MT
or MfA already. Json, Zipfiles, etc have all been done before. If they
don't &quot;just recompile&quot; because of a compatibility issue, then bringing in
the DLL wouldn't have helped you anyway - it still wouldn't have worked. I
agree - it _is_ a little more effort... but then leveraging those
open-source libraries in Objective-C or Java is going to be a *real* PITA.

&gt;&gt;<i>Are people just throwing everything into the one MT project
</I>no no no - you can build sophisticated multi-project solutions in MT and
MfA just like a normal .NET project... but with the added bonus that if you
do a bit of set-up work and planning you can deploy to iOS (phones +
tablets), Android and Windows Phone 7 (throw in Silverlight and Windows 8
if you really want to get tricky and do a bit more planning).

All you need is a couple of 'cloned' csproj files with different &quot;config&quot;
(if you look at MWC, do a diff on MWC.Core.MT.csproj and
MWC.Core.MD.csproj) - and to keep them in sync ongoing. As I said, it's not
perfect (yet) but it works and gives you a massive head-start in deploying
your .NET expertise on iOS &amp; Android. You could also check-out
Touch.Unit&lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/spouliot/Touch.Unit">https://github.com/spouliot/Touch.Unit</A>&gt;and
Andr.Unit &lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/spouliot/Andr.Unit">https://github.com/spouliot/Andr.Unit</A>&gt; to extend your
unit-testing onto the device platforms.

I hope you can get the multiple-project mechanism working. Post if you have
any other questions.

Craig

</I>&gt;<i> What I did on the weekend was start using MD and I found that i'm not that

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This ment that I could do my normal non UI programming in VS (ie,
</I>&gt;<i> core/services/unit tests). I even used NuGet to grab my Json.net.dll and
</I>&gt;<i> Moq.dll (but i'm not using package restore because it's obvious that non
</I>&gt;<i> windows would know how to run nuget.exe :P).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was so excited how interoperable it all was (with of course, the MT
</I>&gt;<i> specific project .. which is totally expected to not work outside of MD
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> MT installed).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So now this means I can't do any of that :( Even worse .. I now need to
</I>&gt;<i> grab
</I>&gt;<i> the src for moq and json.net and add these projects to my solution .. and
</I>&gt;<i> also make sure these projects are not a normal .NET 4 (or 3.5 or whatever)
</I>&gt;<i> class library .. but a &quot;MonoTouch Library Project&quot; ? Oh - and hope and pray
</I>&gt;<i> that they build first go .. or i'm now into a world of pain trying to
</I>&gt;<i> 'port'
</I>&gt;<i> those repos? I'm guessing this is because MT is a superset of Silverlight.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is all sounding more and more fragile and a real PITA when it comes to
</I>&gt;<i> leveraging open source libraries already out there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do other people who are making MT app's use Json.Net or Moq or AutoMapper
</I>&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i> other common oss libraries, all face this same issue? Are people just
</I>&gt;<i> throwning everything into the one MT project .. and not splitting things up
</I>&gt;<i> into multi-projs and doing some TDD?
