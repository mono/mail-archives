<PRE>Hi Craig - that helps a lot .. but really kills me :(

What I did on the weekend was start using MD and I found that i'm not that
efficient in programming in that IDE (just yet). So I commited/pushed my
code to my repo. Switch over to VS2010, pulled .. and opened the sln. All
the projects (except the MT one, of course) opened. I continued programming
all day. Once all my tests worked, I pushed .. switched over the Mac ..
pulled, build-all and tested my unit tests. All green lights!

This ment that I could do my normal non UI programming in VS (ie,
core/services/unit tests). I even used NuGet to grab my Json.net.dll and
Moq.dll (but i'm not using package restore because it's obvious that non
windows would know how to run nuget.exe :P).

I was so excited how interoperable it all was (with of course, the MT
specific project .. which is totally expected to not work outside of MD with
MT installed).

So now this means I can't do any of that :( Even worse .. I now need to grab
the src for moq and json.net and add these projects to my solution .. and
also make sure these projects are not a normal .NET 4 (or 3.5 or whatever)
class library .. but a &quot;MonoTouch Library Project&quot; ? Oh - and hope and pray
that they build first go .. or i'm now into a world of pain trying to 'port'
those repos? I'm guessing this is because MT is a superset of Silverlight.

This is all sounding more and more fragile and a real PITA when it comes to
leveraging open source libraries already out there.

Do other people who are making MT app's use Json.Net or Moq or AutoMapper or
other common oss libraries, all face this same issue? Are people just
throwning everything into the one MT project .. and not splitting things up
into multi-projs and doing some TDD?
