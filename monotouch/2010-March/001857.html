Hi,

I resolved the problem.

I had created a directory named &quot;Resources&quot; which is apparently forbidden on Mac.
I renamed it and everything is now tikkitiboo.

This must be a common problem for developers coming from .Net.

Thanks,
         John.

Don't embed as resource unless you're actually using the image as a
.NET embedded assembly resource, or you'll simply bloat the app size.

* The &quot;Content&quot; build action means that the image file gets included
in the app bundle.
* The &quot;Embed as resource&quot; build action means that the image gets
embedded in the assembly (dll).
* The &quot;Copy to output&quot; and &quot;include in deploy&quot; options are irrelevant
to iPhone apps (though copy to output will waste time and space
copying files to the build directory rather than the app bundle).

If including images in your app bundle causes hangs, please file a bug
report with a test case.
