<PRE>Hi,

We had this discussion before but even after refactoring all of my code I'm still facing exceptions that tell me that there is no IntPtr constructor for certain view controllers, but it was tried to be called on a garbage collected object.

The outcome of the last discussion was:
- One should not implement them
- but you can implement them
- implementing them will hide the true problem
- implementing them might lead to crashes in other places
- some developers however *always* implement them and never face any problems

Currently I'm seeing the exceptions of the missing constructor totlally random for the controllers that are shown as the pages of a UiPageViewController, so really nothing fancy.

Xamarin's opinion is (please correct if I'm wrong):
- I should face these issues mainly (if not even only) in the Simulator because of constant GC
- The cause for the problems is the developer who is not holding references.

In my case I'm seeing the problems *only* on the device (Arm7, iPad 2 and 3, Release or Debug, SGen) and never on the Simulator, even if I trigger simulated memory warnings like crazy.
In the case of the UIPageViewController: what else can I do but return the next or previous controller? Am I really supposed to keep an additional referenced list of controllers?

The UIPageViewController was only an example. There are other controllers with similar problems (stupid UITableViewControllers that are not on screen at all cause this exception minutes after being removed!). To some I added the missing constructor and the issues a gone but I would really like to understand more about this problem.

Or should I just shut up, add the constructors and live a happy life?

Gr&#252;&#223;e, Ren&#233;
