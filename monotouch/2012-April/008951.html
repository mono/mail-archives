<PRE>I've had similar rejections in the recent past, for apps which have
been out for ages. I got this from the app review board people (my app
is a client for a (paid for) accounting system, but it's not MY
accounting system, so inapp purchase can't apply)

Hello Nic,

Thank you for your response and for providing the clarification. Your
app is  a paid white label app for a physical service: accounting
service for existing customers, 11.13 and 11.14 Guidelines do not
apply to physical service

We will expedite the processing of your app and upon completion, your
app will be available on the App Store immediately unless you have
specified a release date.

Thank you for your patience  with the review process.

Best Regards,
App Review

------------

in my case 11.3 and 11.13 were contradictory. One said &quot;use IAP&quot;. The
other says &quot;you can't use IAP for physical goods or services outside
the app&quot;.

Hope that helps.

&gt;<i> Hello MonoTouch'ers:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've had my iOS app on the App Store for about two years now and the app
</I>&gt;<i> review process has always been fast, easy, and no road blocks. &#160;This week I
</I>&gt;<i> released a major update to may app, while the same overall functionality
</I>&gt;<i> hasn't changed. &#160;A free app that uses an external &quot;cloud sync&quot; system
</I>&gt;<i> (subscription) to get data to/from the desktop app.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've never had a problem with Apple with this model, others use it too. &#160;The
</I>&gt;<i> app never cripples and at no time is a subscription required to use the
</I>&gt;<i> functionality of the app. &#160;The subscription is completely external and for
</I>&gt;<i> use of the &quot;cloud&quot; system to port data to/from the desktop. &#160;Well, this week
</I>&gt;<i> was the worst week regarding Apple! &#160;I used to use the UDID but saw online
</I>&gt;<i> (9to5Mac I believe) where Apple was cracking down on UDID use so I got that
</I>&gt;<i> out before ever submitting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think ultimately I had a bad reviewer that didn't know the rules and for
</I>&gt;<i> whatever reason I was stuck with that reviewer through numerous iterations.
</I>&gt;<i> My first submission was rejected because I had a link in the app (a site map
</I>&gt;<i> of our main web site) that pointed to a subscription and he provided a
</I>&gt;<i> screenshot of that subscription &quot;Cloud Backup&quot; which has nothing to do with
</I>&gt;<i> this app whatsoever, it's a backup system for our Windows software. &#160;The
</I>&gt;<i> reviewer cited Apple's section 11.13 which states you can't have a mechanism
</I>&gt;<i> for buying something for this app outside of Apple. &#160;I responded via their
</I>&gt;<i> resolution center that what they pointed out was something not even related
</I>&gt;<i> to the app and resubmitted. &#160;In doing so I removed the links to my web site
</I>&gt;<i> to avoid confusion, it's a dynamically download XML file that generates
</I>&gt;<i> these links so obviously it was something I could restore.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2nd submission - rejected again! &#160;Now they point our that my app has a link
</I>&gt;<i> to <A HREF="http://logbookpro.com/affiliate">http://logbookpro.com/affiliate</A> and <A HREF="http://logbookpro.com/sync.">http://logbookpro.com/sync.</A> &#160;The
</I>&gt;<i> first link is to our free affiliate program - WTF? &#160;Then the second link
</I>&gt;<i> points to our cloud sync portal - NOT the subscription and the portal has no
</I>&gt;<i> reference to the subscription system, it's just a system to monitor the data
</I>&gt;<i> to/from and also information to setup your pairing of device to desktop app
</I>&gt;<i> - FREE to all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3rd submission - and at this time I filed an appeal to the review board as
</I>&gt;<i> well that this reviewer does not seem to know the rules. I pointed out the
</I>&gt;<i> section 11.13 terms that specifies &quot;purchasing an external mechanism for use
</I>&gt;<i> IN THIS APP (i.e. a book for a reader app - ala Kindle)&quot;. &#160;Now he points out
</I>&gt;<i> that I have a link to <A HREF="http://logbookpro.com/schedule">http://logbookpro.com/schedule</A> yet provides a
</I>&gt;<i> screenshot that has a different link (again the /sync link) - rejected
</I>&gt;<i> again!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4th submission - app modified to remove all links, good grief, this is
</I>&gt;<i> clearly a witch hunt!!! &#160;I'm guessing someone complained about what we've
</I>&gt;<i> been doing for over a year, heck iTunes/App Store even pointed to our cloud
</I>&gt;<i> sync subscription info. &#160;Now the app seems to be fine but he rejects the app
</I>&gt;<i> again because my &quot;marketing material&quot; which I assume is the iTunes info
</I>&gt;<i> and/or Marketing link in the app meta data pointed to
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://logbookpro.com/iphone">http://logbookpro.com/iphone</A> and he provides a screenshot of a completely
</I>&gt;<i> different area of our web site which outlines our subscriptions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5th submission - I modified the app meta data and thankfully the app was
</I>&gt;<i> approved!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Beware and be careful! &#160;If your app has links in it that point to anything
</I>&gt;<i> external on your site, etc. that could be a problem, it may! &#160;Again, I
</I>&gt;<i> really think this was a reviewer in the wrong and I've never had a problem
</I>&gt;<i> before! &#160;The moral of this story is you want to cross the app review process
</I>&gt;<i> as little as you can! &#160;Spend a lot of time testing, reviewing, and getting
</I>&gt;<i> your features right up front so you can avoid the process at all costs!
</I>&gt;<i> While typically it's an okay process, this process was devastating! &#160;We've
</I>&gt;<i> spent months on this update and poured our heart and soul into it, we got a
</I>&gt;<i> taste of the bad side of this process this go round. &#160;I figured I'd share it
</I>&gt;<i> with you to help you avoid this nightmare.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The app is now live, thank God! :)
