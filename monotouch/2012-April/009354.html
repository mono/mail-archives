<PRE>Hi folks,

I've found that working in Mono-Develop- isn't as fast as working in Visual
Studio 2010. That's fine. So I've been doing my Tests (xUnit) and class
libraries in VS2010. Commit to GitHub/BitBucket.

Now, I switch over to my Mac, pull latest.

My MonoTouch Iphone application has it's own specific targetting. Also, I
can't reference the normal .NET 4.0 targetted class library projects.

As such, I've had to do some hacky crapy stuff.

For each project and solution, in my solution .. I have a second copy which
targets the IOS platform. So if i have a single class library project that
target's .NET 4.0 .. i have a second .proj file that targets the
MonoForIPhone framework / compile target: Library .. and INCLUDES all those
same files (from the normal .NET 4.0 .proj) into this.

Works great, but it a PITA. Especially if i add/remove/rename some files in
the .NET 4.0 targetted proj file and forget to 'update/refresh' the IOS one.

So .. It would be -really really awesome- if we could include a .MonoTouch
(dot monotouch) file into the root folder .. just like how I have a
.gitignore file in there.

This file can list some simple info like

myapplication.classlibrary.proj MonoForIPhone
myapplication.tests.proj MonoForIPhone

so this would say, those two projects .. they should target
MonoForIPhonewhen opened up in MonoDevelop.

This way, I wouldn't need to have a 2nd IOS proj file for every proj i have
.. and a 2nd sln file for every 2nd IOS proj file i've had to make.

CONS.
But but but! There is a good reason it's targetting a different framework.
Mono/.NET 4.0 framework is not the same as MonoForIPhone framework.

Yep. 1500000% agreed. But I'm very -happy- with that risk. Meaning, if I'm
dumb enough to compile my project against .NET 4.0 with some code that
doesn't exist in the MonoForIPhone framework .. and when I open up that proj
and MonoTouch see's the .MonoTouch file, converts the target framework to
MonoForIPhone and compile errors. I'm kewl with that. 100% completely. Fully
acceptable.

So - good idea/Bad idea?
