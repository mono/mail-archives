&gt;<i> A quick question on threading in iOS.  There is an iOS NSThread.  How does it differ from an MT managed thread/threadpool/task?
</I>
Mono threads are built atop POSIX threads/Pthreads. I have no idea what NSThread is built atop, though Apple documentation [0] suggests that it's built atop Mach threads, as are POSIX threads, so kernel-side they shouldn't be any different.

&gt;<i> Is an NSThread a kernel level thread where as an MT thread/threadpool/task is an application/framework level thread that is at a higher level than an NSThread?
</I>
No, NSThread is a user-level construct, just as Pthreads are. They both work at similar layers of abstraction, if I read [0] correctly.

&gt;<i> Does the threading model of MT (and MfA I would assume) follow an N:1 or M:N threading model
</I>
I have no idea; that's up to libpthread.dylib, and could presumably vary at any time w/o breaking compatibility.

	Threading Packages (p13)
&gt;<i> Although the underlying implementation mechanism for threads is Mach threads, you rarely (if ever) work with threads at the Mach level. Instead, you usually use the more convenient POSIX API or one of its derivatives.
