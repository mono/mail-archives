<PRE>I've encountered a strange issue lately. It doesn't seem to occur at any
particular point in my code, but once it happens it affects all views.

Basically animations stop working. What happens then is the app continues to
work, but any animation just jumps to the end frame, it no longer animates.
Once the problem arises then it affects everything, including: UIView
animations, Core Animation Basic/Key-frame/transition animations. Even built
in UINavigationController animations stop working.

&quot;Animations&quot; such as UIScrollView deceleration continue to work, but as far
as I know these aren't using Core animation, which leads me to think the
problem is occurring there.

I've noticed it occurring randomly at several different points in my app. I
don't even know where to start looking to solve it, or if it is outside the
scope of my code and perhaps a monotouch or even iOS5 problem.

Has anyone encountered anything similar?
