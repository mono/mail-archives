<PRE>Hello Nic Wise,

Thank you very much, your reply is really useful. I go and check your link.
With the help of your link, I understand that I need to draw the PDF as I
draw in a graphic canvas CGContext, overiding the run loop of CoreGraphics.
It may be pain taking to draw and arrange for individual text and pictures
for my required reports. Still thank you I got the Idea how to perform what
I want to do. I find that I can even already create a background PDF and
overwrite text what I want to display as according to seminar video on
coregraphics.

I am quite clear with the PDF generation of an invoice. 
Printing is also okay with air-print enabled printer or any printer LIMITED
TO within wi-fi scope. 

Again another thing arise is, though may be this question is out of
development scope or in developement range. In my case(scenario) I would
like to carry Some goods or products to customer when customer accepts those
things, he'll sign in my iPhone and I would generate PDF immediately. In
this case I'm doing it on a truck while Internet or wi-fi connection is
usually unavialable. Is there any third party tool for integrating print
functionalities together with Monotouch to co-operate printing under no
wi-fi connection.Since as far as I find on google, I find air-print enabled
printer must have wi-fi connection and bluetooth similar. I would like to
carry an Iphone and a printer on a truck. You or anybody hope will it work?
If anyprinter is  sure working with direct iPhone printing without no medium
of internet or wi-fi, kindly direct me links of  those printer vendor
please.

Anyway,
Thanks a lot
Jack
