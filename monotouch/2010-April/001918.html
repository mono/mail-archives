With all due respect, that is FUD. Pure and simple. What you actually 
mean is &quot;I am unhappy that the Objective-C language isn't C# and/or 
XCode tools aren't Visual Studio, so therefore I am not going to try to 
use them.&quot; Having used the same tools since the days of Openstep, I 
can't agree at all. For me, C# was a nice to have as that is my day job. 
Objective-C was my legacy, as is Pascal - what I once used. I'm happily 
reliving the halcyon days again with Apple's tool set, looking in at the 
MT windows, wondering if the overly initial high pricing of the MT 
product, that essentially priced me out of a purchase*, wasn't really a 
blessing. *shrug*.

* I'm still here because I was holding out a hope that a cheaper SKU or 
even virtually free &quot;open source only&quot; version would appear once the 
product was more established. Most Apps I would be developing would be 
for personal use, so that would suit me fine.
