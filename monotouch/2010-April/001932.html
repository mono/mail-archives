</I>&gt;<i> Another less applicable example: on the 3G, memory is tight. I frequently use one of those 3rd party &quot;process killing&quot; apps (Memory Info IIRC) to get as much free RAM as I can before playing games like Worms, Plants vs Zombies and Hockey Nations 2010. It is no longer available in the AppStore, due to it using private API. It doesn't even vaguely work in 4.0. Sure the app runs. It doesn't work though. Something changed under the hood and this is obviously why Apple clamped down on private API use recently. Yes, this is private API, and one could argue that is a different case - except it isn't restricted to private API, as noted above.

</I>&gt;<i> You can't make wide sweeping statements about Apple. It just doesn't work like that in their ecosystem.
