2.x to 3.x broke a number of my own apps because API's had been altered 
in 2.0, old version deprecated and REMOVED in 3.1. Apple is NOT afraid 
to do this.

Another less applicable example: on the 3G, memory is tight. I 
frequently use one of those 3rd party &quot;process killing&quot; apps (Memory 
Info IIRC) to get as much free RAM as I can before playing games like 
Worms, Plants vs Zombies and Hockey Nations 2010. It is no longer 
available in the AppStore, due to it using private API. It doesn't even 
vaguely work in 4.0. Sure the app runs. It doesn't work though. 
Something changed under the hood and this is obviously why Apple clamped 
down on private API use recently. Yes, this is private API, and one 
could argue that is a different case - except it isn't restricted to 
private API, as noted above.

You can't make wide sweeping statements about Apple. It just doesn't 
work like that in their ecosystem.
