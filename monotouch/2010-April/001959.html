<PRE>I think it's a bug. Kanga said that sometimes MD has trouble picking up the IP address, especially on mutli-nic'd machines.

i've had the same issue. when it happens, you can edit the MonoDevelopProperties.xml file in ~/.config/MonoDevelop. there's a key called MonoTouch.Debugger.HostIP

edit it to be the right IP, close MD and re-open.

MonoTouch Forums appear to be down, so I revert to the old way...

I set configuration to Debug/IPhone and press Debug.  Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.  It works whenever the alert says waiting for 10.0.0.3:0000.  It fails (never attaches) whenever it says waiting for some 192 address.

I can't say what causes the 192 to come up.  Seems to happen after a few successful times.  Nor can I say exactly what fixes it.  I rebuild once or twice or sometimes sync from iTunes.  After doing this 2 or three times, it seems to correct itself for the next few times.

Is this a bug, or and I doing something wrong?

Thanks,
Tim
