<PRE>Hey Mauricio, not sure if you've seen it or not, but Novell has released a statement:
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/newstouch/archive/2010/Apr-09.html">http://www.mono-project.com/newstouch/archive/2010/Apr-09.html</A>

patience is now a virtue. :)

for what?, it is inevitable, MT is dead in the water if Apple don't change his mind, and I don't think that that is going to happen ...the statement is clear what else do you want to hear &quot;The code have to be originally write in C, C++, ObjectiveC&quot;, even if is not prohibited for home apps (&quot;just&quot; AppStore come on!, that is about all!!) ho in hell is going to take the risk to write a single piece of code in to risky tool knowing that this is the path that Apple is taking...

Adobe vs Apple?, don't think so, this is a monopolistic action worse than MS or IBM previous actions, but we tend to forget that Jobs and Gates are about the same (sure one of them have a better taste but that's it), they was friend and they don't like each other now just because one take down the other to partially win, but know the other is making his move, of course that Jobs don't want a MS language running in his precious toy!!, I amaze how long this was  survivor..

But nobody is talking about the Novell responsibilities on this, where is the official Novell/MT-Developers statement about this?, how much we are going to wait?, please read your Novell licence about your agreements with Novell when you purchase MT, I taking some lawyer counseling about this, since Novell have some responsibilities about MT licences, has Novell do his job and take some agreement with Apple before offering MT licences at a specific price?, they offer a licence to deploy C# apps to the iphone/ipod, so what is his statement about this &quot;oh, ups sorry they change his mind...anyway thanks for your MT licence money, see you on Android&quot; ?

Bad day for all that we trust on Novell and MT developers from the beta days, just a waist of time and money...

Excuse my ignorance here, but I thought tha MT apps are translated to obj-c anyway on the run? correct me if I am wrong here.
Wouldn't there be a way for MT to then enable devs to translate their app into objC once done and Apple will not know (nor care) about how the code was initially written before translation?

I also believe that it was Adobe's flash compiler that triggered the change in policy.



However I would be naive to think they didn't know about the existence of Unity, MonoTouch and Titanium, etc.

Unfortunately their ruthless legal/executive team are not staffed with muppets, they could've easily chosen wording to exclude Adobe and not other technologies if that was their intention.

It is possible that ruling out a single competitor and not others is a suable offence, in which case Unity/MT/Titanium/etc would be unfortunate necessary victims.




They are not immune to public pressure though, if this draconian policy has any effect on tarnishing their image I believe they will reverse it.

I think our best bet is to somehow get the word out. Anyone got any 'Apple: does evil' badges lying around? :)

I am guessing that this is really about the adobe vs. apple feud.



Apple is directly trying to screw adobe, but covering all their bases by excluding all the development environments outside of XCode.



They are killing adobe for sure, but the collateral damage to Unity3D and MonoTouch is scary.

Thanks for this, the context of the replies is very telling.








There is only 2 reasons I can think of why they would issue the following reply to your request on using MonoTouch.




&quot;Our agreement is aimed at developers who want to distribute their apps through the App Store &quot;










1) MonoTouch and all other related technology is banned. But rather than reply 'Yes our new monopolist strategy effectively renders your effort and investments with MonoTouch futile' they choose to sugar coat it and make it sound like it will only be limited via the 'App store channel' but we still allow you the freedom to explore every other opportunity.









2) It is not a direct answer so they haven't fully made their intentions clear and that they are likely processing the negative-sentiment and media backlash before making there official stance.









Based on the wording in that reply, my conclusion is that MonoTouch is currently prohibited but they may be leaving themselves room to reverse their decision if it turns out to be a catastrophic one.









Regards,




Demis

I am not at liberty to disclose the exact wording of my email, as it contains information sensitive to my firm.



Paraphrasing, this is what I said...



&quot;We are developing applications for the iPhone using MonoTouch. We are using MonoTouch because we have a large pool of talent and work product written in C#.  Your new policy appears to prohibit the use of MonoTouch because it is not an officially sanctioned language. This would require us to throw away and rewrite a large portion of this work product, which is likely a deal breaker for my firm. Please re-think this policy.&quot;



His reply:



&quot;Our agreement is aimed at developers who want to distribute their apps through the App Store &quot;



My reply:



&quot;We intend to develop both in-house *and* app store applications&quot;



His reply:



&quot;We would not accept them into the App Store if they violate our terms. Sorry. &quot;



&gt;<i>From the new agreement:
</I>


&quot;Applications must be originally written in Objective-C, C, C++, or JavaScript as executed by the iPhone OS WebKit engine&quot;



That is pretty clear-cut. If you want to have your app included in the app store, it must be written in Objective-C, C or C++.....   and any javascript can ONLY be executed by the iPhone OS or the webkit engine (UIWebView).



Personally, I think apple's stance on this is ridiculous. I understand them wanting to choke off the compiled-flash option, but the collateral damage here is amazing.

Hi Steve,

What's not clear is what your e-mail said, did you write it in a way that said &quot;I want to use MonoTouch on iPhone OS 4.0 and I want to put it on the app store - will this happen&quot;? And then they would return saying - no, you can't do this but the provisions only apply to AppStore apps.

If the case it that it only applies to the app store - there doesn't seem to be a good reason to only allow enterprise applications and not public applications.

Cheers,

ChrisNTR

I emailed Steve Jobs earlier today, and either he (or some delegate) replied, and the answers were pretty clear.









Paraphrasing his reply: &quot;The new provision is ONLY intended to apply to applications distributed through the app store.&quot;









My thoughts: This is significant because v4.0 of the iPhone OS is supposed to provide for enterprise customers to deploy their apps directly to devices without using the app store. Therefore, in theory, in-house applications would still be able to leverage MonoTouch.









So, I replied back to him, and explained that my firm intends to both create in-house applications, as well as distribute apps via the app store:









Paraphrasing his reply: &quot;Sorry, if you use the app store, you need to adhere to the T.O.S.&quot;









My thoughts: This is pretty clear-cut. I am not sure if apple is going to enforce the new provision, but if we intend to distribute via the app store, it looks like MonoTouch is a dead end.
