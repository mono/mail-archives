Worth taking note of: An update[1] to a November 20th post regarding
PhoneGap and Apple's new developer agreement states:

[ Update:: April 13, 2010 ]

I have received word from Apple that the above is STILL true! If you were
&gt;<i> concerned by the recent changes to Apple&#8217;s iPhone developer agreement, this
</I>&gt;<i> has ZERO impact on PhoneGap!
</I>
Apps built with PhoneGap will continue to be reviewed based on their own
&gt;<i> merits and NOT dismissed/rejected because they use PhoneGap.
</I>
So enough with the crazy speculative rumour mill. Let&#8217;s get back to making
&gt;<i> apps with HTML+CSS+JavaScript.
</I>

Of course, as per its description[2] PhoneGap isn't a development tool per
se, but it does allow developers access to the underlying Objective-C API
using Javascript which in and of itself seems to violate the terms of the
new developer agreement.  Whether any apps submitted to the AppStore that
use PhoneGap are approved or not is yet to be seen, but it does seem worth
contacting Apple for proper clarification.

[2] via <A HREF="http://www.nitobi.com/products/phonegap/">http://www.nitobi.com/products/phonegap/</A> PhoneGap is described as:
Mobile app development made easy

Nitobi's PhoneGap is an open source solution designed to give web developers
JavaScript access to popular mobile device features, like the camera, GPS,
the accelerometer, local SQLite databases and more, without having to write
full applications.
How does it work?

The PhoneGap framework acts as a bridge between web applications and mobile
devices. It lets developers wrap web applications inside a native
application, making development easier for those who aren't familiar with
Objective-C and Cocoa.
