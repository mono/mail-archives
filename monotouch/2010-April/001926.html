<PRE>&quot;Absolutism is the way of the Jobs.&quot;

I used to hold him in high regard, his relentlessness and attention to
detail has produced some amazing quality hardware and software where up
until now they have achieved their market dominance because they are the
best at what they do.

Unfortunately they have no restraints in abusing their new power to wipe out
ISV's without any regards of the consequences - I've peaked into his
dominated world view and I don't like it.
Everyone is too scared to say anything negative publicly in fear of the
consequences.

I no longer trust him with investment of my efforts and will be one of the
first to defect to Android as soon as it becomes a commercially viable
platform.
I just hope the other players in this market recognize that they are an
unstoppable force and unite in promoting an open platform like Android
before they become fragmented into irrelevance. Looks like Palm is already
looking to cash out.

Until then I'm going to explore HTML5 tech on the iPhone - unfortunately the
visible rendering I've seen in the demos does not inspire much confidence of
it on this platform.
