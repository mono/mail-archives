<PRE>I don't guess it really matters what I understand or think about it. 

Apple is the final - and only - say in the matter. 

 

I hope that they will rethink the option. MonoTouch wasn't out to change the
way the iPhone worked or create a new UI. It is there to aid c# developers
in building iPhone apps. MonoTouch wasn't out to change Apple, but instead
bring them more developers. 

 

Others have said and I have to agree that it seems to stem from  Adobe/Apple
issues more than MonoTouch/Unity, but I guess Apple won't just come out and
say so and be explicit about what they want. I'm sure that there is some
hard feelings at Apple about the idea of a Microsoft language being used to
build something for their device.

I am not at liberty to disclose the exact wording of my email, as it
contains information sensitive to my firm.

 

Paraphrasing, this is what I said.

 

&quot;We are developing applications for the iPhone using MonoTouch. We are using
MonoTouch because we have a large pool of talent and work product written in
C#.  Your new policy appears to prohibit the use of MonoTouch because it is
not an officially sanctioned language. This would require us to throw away
and rewrite a large portion of this work product, which is likely a deal
breaker for my firm. Please re-think this policy.&quot;

 

His reply:

 

&quot;Our agreement is aimed at developers who want to distribute their apps
through the App Store &quot;

 

My reply:

 

&quot;We intend to develop both in-house *and* app store applications&quot;

 

His reply:

 

&quot;We would not accept them into the App Store if they violate our terms.
Sorry. &quot;

 

&gt;<i>From the new agreement:
</I>
 

&quot;Applications must be originally written in Objective-C, C, C++, or
JavaScript as executed by the iPhone OS WebKit engine&quot;

 

That is pretty clear-cut. If you want to have your app included in the app
store, it must be written in Objective-C, C or C++...   and any javascript
can ONLY be executed by the iPhone OS or the webkit engine (UIWebView).

 

Personally, I think apple's stance on this is ridiculous. I understand them
wanting to choke off the compiled-flash option, but the collateral damage
here is amazing.

Hi Steve,

What's not clear is what your e-mail said, did you write it in a way that
said &quot;I want to use MonoTouch on iPhone OS 4.0 and I want to put it on the
app store - will this happen&quot;? And then they would return saying - no, you
can't do this but the provisions only apply to AppStore apps.

If the case it that it only applies to the app store - there doesn't seem to
be a good reason to only allow enterprise applications and not public
applications.

Cheers,

ChrisNTR

I emailed Steve Jobs earlier today, and either he (or some delegate)
replied, and the answers were pretty clear.

 

Paraphrasing his reply: &quot;The new provision is ONLY intended to apply to
applications distributed through the app store.&quot;

 

My thoughts: This is significant because v4.0 of the iPhone OS is supposed
to provide for enterprise customers to deploy their apps directly to devices
without using the app store. Therefore, in theory, in-house applications
would still be able to leverage MonoTouch.

 

So, I replied back to him, and explained that my firm intends to both create
in-house applications, as well as distribute apps via the app store:

 

Paraphrasing his reply: &quot;Sorry, if you use the app store, you need to adhere
to the T.O.S.&quot;

 

My thoughts: This is pretty clear-cut. I am not sure if apple is going to
enforce the new provision, but if we intend to distribute via the app store,
it looks like MonoTouch is a dead end.
