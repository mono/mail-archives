<PRE>With all due respect. Dot notation kinda works here and there but not
really but that's ok because u can always fall back to square brackets
an we kinda do GC but not really and heck - what uses to take 5 lines
is now gonna take you 35.

That sounds like a blast to me.

A language that has had 1 major update in the last 25 years, compared
to a modern, well thought out language? Please.

</I>&gt;<i> With all due respect, that isFUD. Pure and simple. What you actually mean is &quot;I am unhappy that the Objective-C language isn't C# and/or XCode tools aren't Visual Studio, so therefore I am not going to try to use them.&quot; Having used the same tools since the days of Openstep, I can't agree at all.For me, C# was a nice to have as that is my day job. Objective-C was my legacy, as is Pascal - what I once used. I'm happily reliving the halcyon days again with Apple's tool set, looking in at the MT windows, wondering if the overly initial high pricing of the MT product, that essentially priced me out of a purchase*, wasn't really a blessing. *shrug*.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * I'm still here because I was holding out a hope that a cheaper SKU or even virtually free &quot;open source only&quot; version would appear once the product was more established. Most Apps I would be developing would be for personal use, so that would suit me fine.
