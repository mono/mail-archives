I'm confused. After reading through the above linked post I'm left with a
sense of empathy towards non-Adobe development tools that are -- as the
writer suggested -- collateral damage of an overaggressive power move by
Adobe.  That's not to suggest I agree with each of the opinions presented by
Mr. Gerbarg, but I don't disagree with them either as I simply don't have
enough data to determine one way or another what's really going on behind
the scenes and what, if anything, can be done to help encourage Apple to
change it's policy in a way that allows room for third party tool vendors to
continue forward unimpeded. In fact, this is exactly the point that Mr.
Gerbarg makes close to the end of this post:

I would like Apple to find a way to work with the existing vendors who have
&gt;<i> (for the most part) been good citizens, and find some way to let them
</I>&gt;<i> continue. As I said above, I suspect Apple doesn't like their runtimes on
</I>&gt;<i> the iPhone, but there is still some value in those platforms and I would
</I>&gt;<i> like Apple to find some way to support them. I think Apple can probably
</I>&gt;<i> achieve the control it wants over the runtime, and allow for more language
</I>&gt;<i> flexibility then current license allows.
</I>

I'm not trying to side with Apple in any way, shape, or form in regards to
their decision to push forward with this clause. If for no other reason,
they have to have known that in doing so they would not only be painting
themselves with a Department of Justice bullseye but designing, contracting
out the manufacturing to China, to then install the war heads on the end
result of their &quot;Designed in California&quot; Cupertino-bound missels inside
their home turf labs in a last gasp effort to die with both dignity and
pride by the workmanship of their own narcissistic hand. And it's for this
reason alone I believe they have no intention of pushing forward with the
clause as it exists in its current form and instead using the time between
now and the final release of version 4 of the OS to put into a place a rigid
certification process that requires third party iPhone and iPad tool vendors
to both meet and adhere to a strict set of guidelines which would disallow
the injection of 3rd party design elements while requiring they pass a
performance benchmark suite designed to guard against memory, processor, and
battery hogging applications being given free reign over their otherwise
tightly controlled user experience.

In this regard I don't believe it's by some strange coincidence that we're
seeing this clause injected into the licensing agreement that covers the
first version of the OS to include the highly anticipated multi-tasking
support which Apple has been purposely holding back to allow battery and
processor technologies to catch up with the increased demand on system
resources brought about as a result.  Again, I don't agree with how Apple
has chosen to go about this, but I do recognize that negatively impacting
the core user experience is not something Apple has or will likely ever
allow and has subsequently built a long standing history of feverishly
reacting negatively against, whether that be stripping features from their
own in-house products or standing in the way of third party involvement that
threatens to undermine their reputation foundation in which Apple has been
built upon since day one.
