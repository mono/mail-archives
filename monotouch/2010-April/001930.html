<PRE>Hello,

With all due respect, that is FUD. Pure and simple. What you actually
&gt;<i> mean is &quot;I am unhappy that the Objective-C language isn't C# and/or
</I>&gt;<i> XCode tools aren't Visual Studio, so therefore I am not going to try to
</I>&gt;<i> use them.&quot;
</I>

Opinions aside, newer languages have evolved to eliminate a large class of
common programming mistakes.

As anyone that has written large systems in C, C++ or Objective-C there is a
whole class of programming errors that developers in these languages make
that just do not exist with managed languages: buffer overflows (the source
of most security exploits in the last few years), double-frees (leading to
corrupted heaps), reuse of freed buffers (leading to corrupted heaps), leaks
in manual GC (cycles in refcounted systems), mismatches in contracts vs
implementations (subtle differences in header files included), runtime
errors due to type mismatches that go from a crash (C/C++) to a runtime
exception (when you use NSObject of one type with another type, &quot;invalid
selector&quot;).

Everyone that has used those languages has come to value fairly expensive
tools: Purify (2,830 list price for 12 months software rental), PC-Lint
(398) and most recently the open sourced Valgrind.   Sadly, none of those
run on the iPhone (although Valgrind runs to some extent on the iPhone
simulator, but requires you to be an advanced Unix hacker to get it to even
properly run).

There is another class of problems: memory leaks, but Apple provides a tool
that can help here (Instruments).   But every study on complexity agrees
that automatic memory management reduces both code complexity, code size and
surface area that developers have to deal with to write software with fewer
defects.

Garbage Collection plays two roles: the first is to free the developer from
bookkeeping, but the *most important* feature is that it enables the
type-safe system that eliminates that whole class of errors described
before.

If you have the budget to pay for senior developers, this is not a problem;
  If you have the budget to pay for double the programmers, this is not a
problem;  If you have the budget to pay for the extra time it will take to
build the software this is not a problem;  If you have the tolerance to ship
later, this is not a problem.

But not everyone can afford that, and that is why language design continues
to evolve and that is why languages like C# and Java continue to improve
year after year, because they help reduce defect rates, and increase
programmer productivity.

You can see it today with the web: first developers had to write C code to
write dynamic web pages, then we got CGIs, then we got scripting languages,
then we got Java, then .NET and the revolution of the web as we know it, the
revolution that made web application development pleasant was lead by a
scripting language that had all sort of dynamism: ruby on rails.

Use the right tool for the right job and all that.
