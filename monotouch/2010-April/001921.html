<PRE>I don't think we should dilute this post by going into a language flame-war
on features as it would be obviously futile especially in this mailing-list
we already know the opinions of where the language superiority lies.
I will say this, having developed with both languages (all my published apps
to this point have been done in obj-c), there are areas where C# is
infinitely more productive. e.g. Cutting up datasets with LINQ and generic
collections (which I routinely find myself doing) effectively requires no
thought in C# while very lacking in Obj-C.
Accessing web services are also a tedious endeavour with Obj-C especially in
this area, code-gen is not just important it is a recommended software
discipline to automate all the redundant boiler-plate code removing human
error and making re-factoring possible with evolving web services.

This is the problem I have with the current T.O.S it does nothing to promote
higher quality apps - in some cases it goes against standard practice to
actually promote poorly designed lower quality applications.
These rules are not based on merit as they don't target the end results they
target the means, with the main purpose of anti-competitively increasing the
development costs to support competing platforms.
