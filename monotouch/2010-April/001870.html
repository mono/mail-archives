<PRE>Sure would be great to hear from the monotouch team on this one. Sounds like
we might be in bad shape and may have wasted the money on MonoTouch. While
Apple does things well. I can't imagine Microsoft - or any other large
company - getting away with this. If it is a native binary what does it
matter how it got that way. I definitely understand not running a VM or
having to install some CLI/CLR on the iPhone, but having to be specific
about what language the original code is in seems a bit over the top.

No, they are public.

Apple has specifically banned apps not written in C, C++ or Obj-C. Really
not good news.

i would assume the terms of the new Apple developer agreement are under NDA,
so anyone actually knowing the terms would be in violation of their NDA by
discussing the publicly. just a thought.
