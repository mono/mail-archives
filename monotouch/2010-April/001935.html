<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;If you have the budget to pay for senior developers, this is not a problem;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  If you have the budget to pay for double the programmers, this is not a problem;  If you have the budget to pay for the extra time it will take to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> build the software this is not a problem;  If you have the tolerance to ship later, this is not a problem. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But not everyone can afford that, and that is why language design continues to evolve and that is why languages like C# and Java continue to improve 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> year after year, because they help reduce defect rates, and increase programmer productivity.&quot;

Thank you Miguel.

This is exactly my frustration and concern regarding the new policy... 

My firm isn't going to invest significant $$$ in training staff to learn these tools. We have a TON of time and resources invested in .NET based libraries that we (in theory) could leverage on the iPhone using monotouch. We have a staff of 25 developers who are well versed in C#/.NET who have no practical experience with objective-C, CocoaTouch or XCode. 

The new policy (in effect) would require my firm to completely rewrite/port these libraries to Objective-C, which over time would be a maintenance nightmare. It would also require us to cross-train developers in Objective-C, which has no practical benefit outside of iPhone development.

Now, one exclusion to this is that applications intended for &quot;enterprise&quot; or &quot;in house distribution&quot; are NOT subject to this provision. The provision only applies to applications being hosted on the app store. This *does* soften the blow for us, as most of the applications in development are intended for internal-use only.... but it does raise the ugly issue that we will still need forked environments for internal vs. public apps.


Bottom line: This new policy is garbage. I am a *huge* apple proponent, but this xenophobic attitude has gone too far.
