<PRE>Here's an exchange I had with Apple Developer Support. It doesn't
really say much but I figured I'd share it anyway. Hopefully Apple
will publish something clearer soon so everyone can stop wondering
what their intentions really are.

Re: iPhone Developer Program

Hello Mike,

Thank you for your followup email regarding the iPhone Developer
Program License Agreement.

Should you have questions regarding the Program License Agreement, we
ask that you please review the agreement with your own legal counsel
against your company's testing and development plans.

Thank you for understanding our program policies.

Regards,

Thanks for the reply.

I wasn't asking about any specific application. I am asking is
monotouch as a devlopment platform allowed under section 3.3.1 of the
new License agreement?

Thanks,
Mike Bluestein

</I>&gt;<i> Region: United States
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dear Apple,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Im trying to plan my current development initiatives, both ongoing work that I have made a considerable investment in and future plans. I use monotouch as my primary development platform. Does the recent section 3.3.1 of the developer agreement preclude the use of monotouch as a way to create native iphone applications?
