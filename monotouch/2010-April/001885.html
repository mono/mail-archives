<PRE>I am guessing that this is really about the adobe vs. apple feud.

Apple is directly trying to screw adobe, but covering all their bases by excluding all the development environments outside of XCode.

They are killing adobe for sure, but the collateral damage to Unity3D and MonoTouch is scary.

Thanks for this, the context of the replies is very telling.

There is only 2 reasons I can think of why they would issue the following reply to your request on using MonoTouch.
&quot;Our agreement is aimed at developers who want to distribute their apps through the App Store &quot;

1) MonoTouch and all other related technology is banned. But rather than reply 'Yes our new monopolist strategy effectively renders your effort and investments with MonoTouch futile' they choose to sugar coat it and make it sound like it will only be limited via the 'App store channel' but we still allow you the freedom to explore every other opportunity.

2) It is not a direct answer so they haven't fully made their intentions clear and that they are likely processing the negative-sentiment and media backlash before making there official stance.

Based on the wording in that reply, my conclusion is that MonoTouch is currently prohibited but they may be leaving themselves room to reverse their decision if it turns out to be a catastrophic one.

Regards,
Demis

Paraphrasing, this is what I said...

&quot;We are developing applications for the iPhone using MonoTouch. We are using MonoTouch because we have a large pool of talent and work product written in C#.  Your new policy appears to prohibit the use of MonoTouch because it is not an officially sanctioned language. This would require us to throw away and rewrite a large portion of this work product, which is likely a deal breaker for my firm. Please re-think this policy.&quot;

His reply:

&quot;Our agreement is aimed at developers who want to distribute their apps through the App Store &quot;

My reply:

&quot;We intend to develop both in-house *and* app store applications&quot;

His reply:

&quot;We would not accept them into the App Store if they violate our terms. Sorry. &quot;

&gt;<i>From the new agreement:
</I>
&quot;Applications must be originally written in Objective-C, C, C++, or JavaScript as executed by the iPhone OS WebKit engine&quot;

That is pretty clear-cut. If you want to have your app included in the app store, it must be written in Objective-C, C or C++.....   and any javascript can ONLY be executed by the iPhone OS or the webkit engine (UIWebView).

Personally, I think apple's stance on this is ridiculous. I understand them wanting to choke off the compiled-flash option, but the collateral damage here is amazing.

Hi Steve,

What's not clear is what your e-mail said, did you write it in a way that said &quot;I want to use MonoTouch on iPhone OS 4.0 and I want to put it on the app store - will this happen&quot;? And then they would return saying - no, you can't do this but the provisions only apply to AppStore apps.

If the case it that it only applies to the app store - there doesn't seem to be a good reason to only allow enterprise applications and not public applications.

Cheers,

I emailed Steve Jobs earlier today, and either he (or some delegate) replied, and the answers were pretty clear.

Paraphrasing his reply: &quot;The new provision is ONLY intended to apply to applications distributed through the app store.&quot;

My thoughts: This is significant because v4.0 of the iPhone OS is supposed to provide for enterprise customers to deploy their apps directly to devices without using the app store. Therefore, in theory, in-house applications would still be able to leverage MonoTouch.

So, I replied back to him, and explained that my firm intends to both create in-house applications, as well as distribute apps via the app store:

Paraphrasing his reply: &quot;Sorry, if you use the app store, you need to adhere to the T.O.S.&quot;

My thoughts: This is pretty clear-cut. I am not sure if apple is going to enforce the new provision, but if we intend to distribute via the app store, it looks like MonoTouch is a dead end.
