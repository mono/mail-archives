<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't think that this tells us much as the current T.O.S are rather vague and open to some interpretation (especially for imaginative stretchy minds who want to fall within the rules).
</I>
Apple controls the interpretation in this case, so it doesn't matter what WE think... It matters what THEY think.

&gt;&gt;<i> What would be ideal is some indication of intent, or ideally if this means that technology like MonoTouch are fundamentally prohibited.
</I>
Apple isn't going to enumerate everything they consider to be a violation. They are essentially saying that outside of C, C++ and Objective-C, everything is in violation.

&gt;&gt;<i> e.g. Something along the lines of, 'do you intend to prohibit/kill all 3rd party tools for developers programming with languages other than C/C++/Obj-C from creating apps that can be deployed in the App store?'.
</I>
Apple is never going to acknowledge this. They aren't intending to kill 3rd party tools... they ARE intending on preserving the viability and integrity of the iPhone app store experience (see how marketing spins these things?)

&gt;&gt;<i> Also some details on whether the 3.3.1 clause was under review and likely to change would also be informative.
</I>
Typically, things are vetted by legal before NDA's are signed :(

&gt;&gt;<i> The annoying thing is that the iPhone/iPad is locked and the App store is effectively the only commercial opportunity developers have.
</I>
The iPhone OS 4.0 made reference to enterprise distribution directly to devices....    If you intend on creating 'public' apps, it appears that we are screwed.

&gt;&gt;<i>Anyway I don't think the hammer is all the way down, until Apple or Novell make an official statement. Knowing Apple, it is likely we may not know until the first MT app is rejected because it contravenes clause 3.3.1.
</I>
Here is to hoping :)

Hi Steve,

What's not clear is what your e-mail said, did you write it in a way that said &quot;I want to use MonoTouch on iPhone OS 4.0 and I want to put it on the app store - will this happen&quot;? And then they would return saying - no, you can't do this but the provisions only apply to AppStore apps.

If the case it that it only applies to the app store - there doesn't seem to be a good reason to only allow enterprise applications and not public applications.

Cheers,

I emailed Steve Jobs earlier today, and either he (or some delegate) replied, and the answers were pretty clear.

Paraphrasing his reply: &quot;The new provision is ONLY intended to apply to applications distributed through the app store.&quot;

My thoughts: This is significant because v4.0 of the iPhone OS is supposed to provide for enterprise customers to deploy their apps directly to devices without using the app store. Therefore, in theory, in-house applications would still be able to leverage MonoTouch.

So, I replied back to him, and explained that my firm intends to both create in-house applications, as well as distribute apps via the app store:

Paraphrasing his reply: &quot;Sorry, if you use the app store, you need to adhere to the T.O.S.&quot;

My thoughts: This is pretty clear-cut. I am not sure if apple is going to enforce the new provision, but if we intend to distribute via the app store, it looks like MonoTouch is a dead end.
