<PRE>Hey,

I can understand everyone's frustrations but this is a very trying time for
Novell aswell. They're not the least bit at fault here and are doing
everything they can to comply. This is currently their last published
statement on the issue:
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/newstouch/archive/2010/Apr-09.html">http://www.mono-project.com/newstouch/archive/2010/Apr-09.html</A>

I genuinely believe that Novell is doing the best that they can and are even
more desperate to comply to the new T.O.S so they can continue to operate
their business than we are.
The problem as I see it is that they are firstly under an NDA but more
importantly they haven't received an official response from Apple so they're
not burning their bridges by making any hasty-hate messages like an Adobe
official has done here: <A HREF="http://theflashblog.com/?p=1888">http://theflashblog.com/?p=1888</A>

I personally agree with their current stance (and think it stands the most
chance of success) for Novell to try to keep a friendly/ally relationship
with Apple and illustrate how their technology is empowering App developers
and adding a lot of value to the iPhone eco-system by enabling developers to
build native fast, targeted Apps that produce an amazing targeted user
experience. In this way, Apple should have no valid technical decision to
prohibit this.

MonoTouch's C-powered runtime blends the power of native code and Apple's
&gt;<i> iPhoneOS APIs with type safety, automatic memory management, and other
</I>&gt;<i> benefits that years of runtime innovation have delivered to the ISO Common
</I>&gt;<i> Language Infrastructure.
</I>

&lt;<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/newstouch/archive/2010/Apr-09.html">http://www.mono-project.com/newstouch/archive/2010/Apr-09.html</A>&gt;
Until an official clarification has come from Apple, the best thing we can
probably do is build 'killer apps' with MonoTouch so if its rejected because
of this draconian ruling than users can see that Apple's monopolist actions
are hurting everyone.

We need to get the word out. Existing iPhone developers and more importantly
Users currently don't care because it hasn't affected them yet, when it does
it will hopefully hurt their image enough, so that hopefully it will cause
them to go into damage control and reverse their actions.

Regards,
Demis
