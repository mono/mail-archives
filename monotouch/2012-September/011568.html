<PRE>&gt;<i> No. If we were in I (say) and the button for branch 2 was tapped then we'd
</I>&gt;<i> navigate to whatever view (D,E,F or G) was last visible in that branch. If
</I>&gt;<i> the user had not visited branch two then D would be displayed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Imagine a tabbed view with an independent UINavigationController on each
</I>&gt;<i> tab. Maybe this is the way it should be implemented?
</I>
That sounds like a good way. Given you need to handle state, I guess
the options might be:

when you pop things off, keep them around, so you can push them back
on later? Not sure if this would work, but it might be worth a try.

or save the save before switching?

or the tab option, which I think might be a better design choice,
unless you are using tabs already?

If you had a homescreen, you have have:

home
A/B/C tab
D/E/F/G tab
H/I/J tab

and tapping A/D/H on the home screen could just set that tab as the
current one (Which might end the user up at G (from D) if they were
deep in the navigation already)

&gt;<i> To complicate matters (or make it more interesting depending on your point
</I>&gt;<i> of view :-), the app is cross-platform and the navigation system is in
</I>&gt;<i> shared code. So the iOS specific construction of the navigation system (eg
</I>&gt;<i> when to create a UINavigationController) is to be done at run time, on the
</I>&gt;<i> fly based on a navigation &quot;path&quot; that is passed from the cross platform
</I>&gt;<i> code. This is a little bit like what is done in MonoCross except we have
</I>&gt;<i> rolled our own to keep control of the view lifetimes better.
</I>
Hrmm, the &quot;Save state and recreate it later&quot; option sounds like a good
route to try, then.... being the state would be consistent across
platforms.
