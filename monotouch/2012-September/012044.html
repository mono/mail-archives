<PRE>Hi Jeff,

My issues could come down to the performance of my MacBook it is pretty old a dual core, 4gb of ram, how much better does monodevelop run on a quad core, I see my CPU max'ed out for many minutes at a time when compiling is happening, memory seems to be ok so I am guessing there is not excessive paging of memory, so it comes down to CPU and a bit of hdd.

my current MacBook is:-

  Model Name:	MacBook Pro
  Model Identifier:	MacBookPro3,1
  Processor Name:	Intel Core 2 Duo
  Processor Speed:	2.2 GHz
  Number of Processors:	1
  Total Number of Cores:	2
  L2 Cache:	4 MB
  Memory:	4 GB
  Bus Speed:	800 MHz

I am contemplating a quad core 15&quot; with a solid state hdd with 8gb of ram, I need to reduce the compile round trip times significantly if I can, is it worth investigating this route?

</I>&gt;<i> thanks for the reply,

</I>&gt;<i> This problems has been occurring on and off for months, but in the last week 100% of the Xcode updates are no making their way into MonoDevelop it has forced me to recode my project to be xib free, it does not help that this happened right in the middle of a load of work with beta testers, but an xib free app should be better in the long run. I have had so many crashes that always report, some in MonoDevelop and some in Xcode, I have also noted that there are times where the sync'ing back to MonoDevelop has crashed both MonoDevelop and XCode at the same time, both needing to be forced to quit which does not make sense to me as the sync'ing from what I can see is not done via processes but file watching if you see my logic.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's some IPC (via AppleScripting) between MonoDevelop and Xcode as well, during the syncing process, so this might explain that.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will in future use Xcode to only prototype screen layouts then creating the views programatically.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not only do I have to create them from scratch but I cannot use the original names as this throws up so many errors that I cannot fix, I have so many views now with 2's or 3's on the end of them. Also a side issue is renaming of objects in Xcode I have never got this to work properly and be reflected back in MonoDevelop but that is another issue, but having many objects that have the wrong name is not good.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Where are the timeouts?, I will have a play with them if they are available to me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, they are not available for users to tweak (they are currently hard-coded in MonoDevelop). MonoDevelop's XcodeSync log file would help me figure out if it is related to the timeouts at all, or if it is something else.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will do some further testing before I go down the route of logging a bug.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you can get your hands on the appropriate XcodeSync log file in the MonoDevelop log directory, that might be enough. I added some fairly verbose debugging WriteLines in MonoDevelop's syncing logic in order to make it easier for me to debug these kinds of issues.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You should be able to find them in /Users/&lt;name&gt;/Library/Logs/MonoDevelop-3.0/Xcode*.log
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hope that helps,
</I>&gt;<i>
