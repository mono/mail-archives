<PRE>Hi Everyone

My app has been rejected for crashing. I cannot and have not been able 
to reproduce what the app store review has described crashes my app.

I have symbolicated the crash logs but not all of the symbols from my 
code are symbolicated...

Looking around online it seems that other people have this problem and 
there doesn't seem to be a definitive solution. Or maybe this is just 
normal?..

The steps that I took to symbolicate are:

1. Copy the Application.app, Application.dSYM and crash reports into the 
same folder.
2. Open XCode organizer.
3. Go to Device logs and click import.
4. Select the crash files and import them.

I have also run dwarfdump --uuid to confirm that the .app and .dSYM 
files are the same build.

When I say not all of the symbols are symbolicated what I mean is that 
only one reference to my code has been symbolicated. Here is a link to 
the symbolicated file 
<A HREF="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5ghoqfnILgZVGJuUElNOGNVQTA">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5ghoqfnILgZVGJuUElNOGNVQTA</A>

So my questions are:

1. Is this one reference to my code (Thread 0: 17) the problem which is 
crashing my app?
2. When building the app for the app store in order to get proper 
symbolicating do I have to select &quot;Enable debugging&quot;?
3. Is there anything that I can do with this crash file to resolve the 
references that have not been symbolicated?

Thanks
Liam
