<PRE>Agreed, you'll find examples on either side of the fence - and it doesn't matter what community that fence sits in.

The real problem is the lack of discoverability in the store, but I could rant on that all day.

Heh - read an Android Fanboi's review of the iPhone 5 (or any iPhone) to see how positive they are lol

I think the difference is there's not the same money in the Android space. Making your app #1 can mean a ton of money for the developer - and I don't think unethical business is limited to the App Store.

Subject: [MonoTouch] Bogus app reviews (user reviews of an app)

I'm shocked at how unethical the app reviews (user reviews, not app review process) system is in the Apple App Store.  I wish Apple would allow app's to turn off reviews as it's so ridiculous!  Apple fanbois are so worried about their reviews they go out of their way to create multiple iTunes accounts and blast bogus 5 star reviews on their products and if you offer something that competes that's free they'll attack you and post stupid stuff using false aliases.  I'm trying to run an ethical operation here but it seems that's not possible in the land of Apple in &quot;hype&quot; and falsehoods.

Has anyone found a way to deal with unethical app reviews either on your competitor's apps or attacks on yours?  It's so childish and while I try to not let it bother me I just wish it could be policed better.

It's amazing the difference between Android and iOS.  Mac/iOS (not MonoTouch/.NET) devs seems to be a bunch of babies that fell on their head at birth and are so insecure and negative.  Android users are positive people and post completely polar opposite in reviews and appreciation.  Such a difference in cultures.  It's a shame iOS is so successful when it was born so completely unethical (ala Steve Jobs) and their insecure culture.
