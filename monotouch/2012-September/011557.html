No. If we were in I (say) and the button for branch 2 was tapped then we'd navigate to whatever view (D,E,F or G) was last visible in that branch. If the user had not visited branch two then D would be displayed.

Imagine a tabbed view with an independent UINavigationController on each tab. Maybe this is the way it should be implemented?

&gt;<i> If so, you can PopToRootController and then push A or H. Easy.
</I>I've already used this pattern in a case where we have a navigation across the branches of a gui. In this case though there was no requirement to maintain the stack we were navigation away from.


To complicate matters (or make it more interesting depending on your point of view :-), the app is cross-platform and the navigation system is in shared code. So the iOS specific construction of the navigation system (eg when to create a UINavigationController) is to be done at run time, on the fly based on a navigation &quot;path&quot; that is passed from the cross platform code. This is a little bit like what is done in MonoCross except we have rolled our own to keep control of the view lifetimes better.

Thanks for your help.
