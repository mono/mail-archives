<PRE>I can't help you with that little information. Typically this kind of 
error has nothing to do with table views specifically. It is a generic 
error. If you are seeing it with a table view then maybe you are doing 
something wrong with how you implemented your table views. Are you perhaps 
implementing your cell views using a view controller? That could trigger 
this error. Cells should be standalone views, not views belonging to a 
view controller. That might show up if your GetCell() method is 
constructing a view controller and then adding using its view as a part of 
the returned table cell.

Basically what you're looking for is any code which constructs a view 
controller object (of any type) and then fetches its View property and 
adds it as a subview of something else. Try searching for &quot;.View&quot;.

You could also perhaps be implementing LoadView in a class which inherits 
from UITableViewController. The UITableViewController class already 
implements LoadView, which creates a UITableView and assigns it to the 
View property. If you are overriding that method and also assigning to the 
View property then it might also complain about that.

Adam, I am having this issue throughout my project when it comes to 
loading tableviewcontrollers. When trying to set my tables source it 
crashes with this error.  Do you have any examples of how this should be 
done in table view controller the correct way.

Thanks
Michael Murdock

This issue is probably more related to iOS 5 than iOS 6. Starting in iOS 5 
they added the ability to have child view controllers. Prior to iOS 5 you 
were told never to add a UIViewController's View as a subview of another 
view (other than the window, of course). If you were careful and lived 
with certain shortcomings (like lack of notifications for things like 
rotation notifications) then you could get away with it, but it was never 
really supported. In iOS 5 they provided an official mechanism for doing 
this. They provided methods like AddChildViewController and 
RemoveFromParentViewController, as well as notification methods 
Will/DidMoveToParentViewController.

As part of that change they started to enforce a relationship between the 
hierarchy of view controllers and the hierarchy of their views. That is, 
if a view controller is a child of another view controller then its view 
must also be a child of (perhaps indirectly) of the same view controller's 
view. Likewise, a view controller's view should not be a child (directly 
or indirectly) of another view controller's view if it is not a child of 
that view controller itself. This requirement is checked in certain 
situations, and if they find a violation then they raise that assertion.

Apparently your code violated that requirement. The solution is to use the 
new API to tell iOS about the relationship between the view controllers.
