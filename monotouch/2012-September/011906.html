<PRE>Well, I thought it was a bug in my code, but apparently it's something else. 
So strange.  The echo statement in the PHP file just doesn't make it to the
iPhone... but only under a cellular transport.  It always works under wifi,
and it even always works if I connect to a wifi hotspot using another
cellular network.  When I connect using just the iPhone AT&amp;T cellular it
only receives the echo statement about 2% of the time.  What's odd is that
if I go into the PHP file which is only about 90 lines of code and move a
static echo statement returning the expected results, I can get it to work
consistently when it returns early.  I'm just not seeing the correlation. 
In one case it would suggest there is a bug in the PHP code, but why would
it always work under a wifi connection and not a transport.  If it's a
timing issue with cellular being slower, why would it work when the wifi is
actually a cellular network of another phone that is also slower than the
wifi.  ?????  puzzling.
