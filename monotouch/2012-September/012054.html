<PRE>Hi Alex,

I've uploaded a pre-release (we haven't bumped the version yet, so it's
still called 3.0.4.7):
<A HREF="https://files.xamarin.com/~jeff/MonoDevelop-3.0.4.7.dmg">https://files.xamarin.com/~jeff/MonoDevelop-3.0.4.7.dmg</A>

Let me know how that works out.

Jeff

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Alex,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's worth investigating. I can make no guarantees that your current
</I>&gt;<i> hardware is the cause of the xcode syncing problem, of course, but it's
</I>&gt;<i> possible. Upgrading your hardware certainly wouldn't hurt. A year ago when
</I>&gt;<i> I was doing a lot of work on the Xcode syncing stuff, I was finding that
</I>&gt;<i> 4GB of RAM for running 2 copies of MonoDevelop (debugging MonoDevelop
</I>&gt;<i> inside MonoDevelop) and Xcode side-by-side was a bit on the slow side and
</I>&gt;<i> once I upgraded my RAM, things ran a lot faster. 8GB of RAM and an SSD
</I>&gt;<i> should improve things a lot for you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That said, I did find one error in the log files you sent me yesterday
</I>&gt;<i> indicating a race condition that caused an NRE during one of the last syncs
</I>&gt;<i> in your most recent MonoDevelop session. I'm not 100% sure that it is the
</I>&gt;<i> cause of the failure to sync, but it might be. The problem is that I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> sure how the race was happening (the only way I can see how it could have
</I>&gt;<i> happened is if our AppleSdkSettings object emitted a Changed event
</I>&gt;<i> mid-sync, but I'm not sure how that could happen). That was the only
</I>&gt;<i> code-path that didn't do the proper locking before modifying some internal
</I>&gt;<i> state variables used by the syncing process. I've added the proper locking
</I>&gt;<i> for an upcoming MonoDevelop 3.0.4.8 release (I can provide a pre-release
</I>&gt;<i> download for you as soon as I get to the office). Maybe you can test it out
</I>&gt;<i> for a few days and see if it seems to solve the issue for you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hope that helps,
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My issues could come down to the performance of my MacBook it is pretty

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am contemplating a quad core 15&quot; with a solid state hdd with 8gb of

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Jeff,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> thanks for the reply,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This problems has been occurring on and off for months, but in the last
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> week 100% of the Xcode updates are no making their way into MonoDevelop it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> has forced me to recode my project to be xib free, it does not help that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this happened right in the middle of a load of work with beta testers, but
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> an xib free app should be better in the long run. I have had so many
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> crashes that always report, some in MonoDevelop and some in Xcode, I have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> also noted that there are times where the sync'ing back to MonoDevelop has
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> crashed both MonoDevelop and XCode at the same time, both needing to be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> forced to quit which does not make sense to me as the sync'ing from what I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> can see is not done via processes but file watching if you see my logic.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There's some IPC (via AppleScripting) between MonoDevelop and Xcode as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well, during the syncing process, so this might explain that.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I will in future use Xcode to only prototype screen layouts then
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> creating the views programatically.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Not only do I have to create them from scratch but I cannot use the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> original names as this throws up so many errors that I cannot fix, I have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> so many views now with 2's or 3's on the end of them. Also a side issue is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> renaming of objects in Xcode I have never got this to work properly and be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> reflected back in MonoDevelop but that is another issue, but having many
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> objects that have the wrong name is not good.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Where are the timeouts?, I will have a play with them if they are
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> available to me.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Unfortunately, they are not available for users to tweak (they are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> currently hard-coded in MonoDevelop). MonoDevelop's XcodeSync log file
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would help me figure out if it is related to the timeouts at all, or if it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is something else.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I will do some further testing before I go down the route of logging a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> bug.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you can get your hands on the appropriate XcodeSync log file in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MonoDevelop log directory, that might be enough. I added some fairly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> verbose debugging WriteLines in MonoDevelop's syncing logic in order to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make it easier for me to debug these kinds of issues.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You should be able to find them in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /Users/&lt;name&gt;/Library/Logs/MonoDevelop-3.0/Xcode*.log
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hope that helps,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
