<PRE>Hi Alex,

&gt;<i> Hi Jeff,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
There's some IPC (via AppleScripting) between MonoDevelop and Xcode as
well, during the syncing process, so this might explain that.


&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not only do I have to create them from scratch but I cannot use the

</I>&gt;<i> renaming of objects in Xcode I have never got this to work properly and be

</I>&gt;<i> objects that have the wrong name is not good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Where are the timeouts?, I will have a play with them if they are
</I>&gt;<i> available to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Unfortunately, they are not available for users to tweak (they are
currently hard-coded in MonoDevelop). MonoDevelop's XcodeSync log file
would help me figure out if it is related to the timeouts at all, or if it
is something else.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will do some further testing before I go down the route of logging a bug.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If you can get your hands on the appropriate XcodeSync log file in the
MonoDevelop log directory, that might be enough. I added some fairly
verbose debugging WriteLines in MonoDevelop's syncing logic in order to
make it easier for me to debug these kinds of issues.

You should be able to find them in
/Users/&lt;name&gt;/Library/Logs/MonoDevelop-3.0/Xcode*.log

Hope that helps,

Jeff
