<PRE>&gt;<i> 1) It feels (a lot) slower. I am not sure how it might fare when everyone
</I>&gt;<i> else upgrades on day one.
</I>
Odd, I've found it - on my iPhone 4S - to be very quick. The 3D map is
a little slow, but thats to be expected (you're talking iOS6 right?)

&gt;<i> 2) Custom push pins don't seem to work very well (appear randomly)
</I>
Define &quot;custom&quot;? Just a pin? or your image? I've been dropping pins
fine, tho I've not tried custom images for them.

&gt;<i> 3) Tiles seem to be missing (or fail to download) - might be the reason for
</I>&gt;<i> 1)
</I>
&gt;<i>From what I know there aren't really tiles, it's all vector.
</I>
&gt;<i> 4) Satellite view quality seems to be very poor outside of major cities
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I agree. Looking at the Scottish Highlands, it's VERY low res. London
is fine. I could see myself if I was at home (and the sat was above
me)

&gt;<i> On the plus side the road maps look very clear an crisp.
</I>
Have you tried the turn by turn nav? it's rather good. Now, if I can
offline a journey, then I'm SOLD.

&gt;<i> Has any one else tried this or overcome any of the problems above
</I>&gt;<i> (especially the custom pins) or is it just my code &amp; my internet connection
</I>&gt;<i> causing me pain?
</I>
Sorry, no. And if we did, I'm not sure we could discuss it (bloody
NDA). Try on the apple forums, it's not hard to mentally translate
to/from Objc :)

&gt;<i> Are there good mapkit replacements or could someone wrap up all the google
</I>&gt;<i> stuff and call it GMapKit or something?
</I>
I suspect they will, but not yet.

Look into OpenStreetMap, you might be able to use that, but you also
might have to run your own tile server for it!

Personally, I'm getting to like the new maps app. It's less busy than
the old one, so it'll be interesting when I'm in a city I don't know
(eg Berlin later this month), but over all, I like it.
