Hi Jeff,

thanks for the reply,

This problems has been occurring on and off for months, but in the last week 100% of the Xcode updates are no making their way into MonoDevelop it has forced me to recode my project to be xib free, it does not help that this happened right in the middle of a load of work with beta testers, but an xib free app should be better in the long run. I have had so many crashes that always report, some in MonoDevelop and some in Xcode, I have also noted that there are times where the sync'ing back to MonoDevelop has crashed both MonoDevelop and XCode at the same time, both needing to be forced to quit which does not make sense to me as the sync'ing from what I can see is not done via processes but file watching if you see my logic.

I will in future use Xcode to only prototype screen layouts then creating the views programatically.

Not only do I have to create them from scratch but I cannot use the original names as this throws up so many errors that I cannot fix, I have so many views now with 2's or 3's on the end of them. Also a side issue is renaming of objects in Xcode I have never got this to work properly and be reflected back in MonoDevelop but that is another issue, but having many objects that have the wrong name is not good.

Where are the timeouts?, I will have a play with them if they are available to me.

I will do some further testing before I go down the route of logging a bug.

Thanks

Alex

Hi Alex,

You should not be having to recreate them from scratch. There is clearly a bug in MonoDevelop's Xcode syncing, somewhere.

Is it possible for you to file a bug about this on <A HREF="http://bugzilla.xamarin.com&lt;http://bugzilla.xamarin.com/">http://bugzilla.xamarin.com&lt;http://bugzilla.xamarin.com/</A>&gt; and attach your XcodeSync&lt;date&gt;.log file (you can attach it and mark it private). This log file might provide some clues...

I suspect it might be that the sync is timing out (I may need to up the timeout for projects as large as yours?), but I won't know for sure w/o seeing the log file.

Thanks,

Jeff

Hi All,

I have a project that has 80+ xib files, there seems to be significant problems with updates mainly from Xcode back to MonoDevelop, I have tried saving the xib file in Xcode, I have tried closing the xib in Xcode, I have tried closing Xcode completely, rebooting the computer, Xcode shows the changes to the xib file. but mono touch does not see the changes, e.g. add a new item to the xib file, move something in the xib file, delete something in the xib file, mono touch just does not see the changes. This has been a constant battle I am running all the latest versions of everything but this has happened with all the version in the last 6 months, sometimes it works sometimes it does not. In my latest issue all I am trying to do is set a tableview to grouped, I cannot do this in Xcode, I cannot do this in code, I have removed the xib from the tableviewcontroller and tried to create the tableview programatically this does not work as it is still referring to the xib file even though I hav
 e removed the reference to it in the constructor.

My project is littered with old and new xib files because of this type of issue where the only fix is to create a new file from scratch.

It is a bit late for this project but I will never use Xcode again, I will create everything programatically in the future.

Do I have to recreate all these files from scratch like I am doing this seems a bit over the top.

ATB

Alex
