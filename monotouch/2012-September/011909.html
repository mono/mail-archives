<PRE>Hi All,

I have a project that has 80+ xib files, there seems to be significant problems with updates mainly from Xcode back to MonoDevelop, I have tried saving the xib file in Xcode, I have tried closing the xib in Xcode, I have tried closing Xcode completely, rebooting the computer, Xcode shows the changes to the xib file. but mono touch does not see the changes, e.g. add a new item to the xib file, move something in the xib file, delete something in the xib file, mono touch just does not see the changes. This has been a constant battle I am running all the latest versions of everything but this has happened with all the version in the last 6 months, sometimes it works sometimes it does not. In my latest issue all I am trying to do is set a tableview to grouped, I cannot do this in Xcode, I cannot do this in code, I have removed the xib from the tableviewcontroller and tried to create the tableview programatically this does not work as it is still referring to the xib file even though I have removed the reference to it in the constructor.

My project is littered with old and new xib files because of this type of issue where the only fix is to create a new file from scratch.

It is a bit late for this project but I will never use Xcode again, I will create everything programatically in the future.

Do I have to recreate all these files from scratch like I am doing this seems a bit over the top.

ATB

Alex
