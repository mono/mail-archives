<PRE>&gt;<i> I'm interested in what to do without ViewDidUnload too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is there some other notification we should use to free up resources,
</I>&gt;<i> unsubscribe from events, etc?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> E.g does Dispose get called when a viewpoint roller gets popped off 
</I>&gt;<i> the navigation stack? (Or when the memory warning arrives like 
</I>&gt;<i> viewdidunload used to?)
</I>
At WWDC Apple engineers explained that the memory savings from releasing 
views in ViewDidUnload was trivial. Most of the memory savings comes from 
allowing the backing layers for those views to leave memory, and they 
already do that regardless of whether you release the views themselves. 
Since incorrect implementations of ViewDidUnload was a very common source 
of crashes they decided it no longer made sense to implement those methods 
at all. You're not gaining anything, and you're likely to mess it up and 
crash anyway. So they decided to just deprecate the whole function. In iOS 
6 it won't be called at all, and they even recommended that you just stop 
implementing it in earlier OSes as well (the same logic applies).

So what do you do with the code in that function? If all you're doing is 
releasing views (like ReleaseDesignerOutlets()) then just delete the code. 
It's not necessary. If you were doing something else that is important for 
memory savings (like releasing some caches) then move that code into 
ViewDidReceiveMemoryWarning and add this condition around it:
if (IsViewLoaded &amp;&amp; View.Window != null)
{
        // Clear unnecessary caches
}

Then of course you need to have the necessary logic implemented elsewhere 
to repopulate those caches whenever needed.

If you were unsubscribing from notifications then there are several 
functions that you could choose from:
ViewWill/DidDisappear
Will/DidMoveToParentViewController

ViewWillDisappear is probably your best option.

You should of course ALSO include such code in the Dispose(bool) method 
(with and &quot;if (disposing)&quot; guard).
