<PRE>I'm shocked at how unethical the app reviews (user reviews, not app review
process) system is in the Apple App Store.  I wish Apple would allow app's
to turn off reviews as it's so ridiculous!  Apple fanbois are so worried
about their reviews they go out of their way to create multiple iTunes
accounts and blast bogus 5 star reviews on their products and if you offer
something that competes that's free they'll attack you and post stupid stuff
using false aliases.  I'm trying to run an ethical operation here but it
seems that's not possible in the land of Apple in &quot;hype&quot; and falsehoods.

 

Has anyone found a way to deal with unethical app reviews either on your
competitor's apps or attacks on yours?  It's so childish and while I try to
not let it bother me I just wish it could be policed better.

 

It's amazing the difference between Android and iOS.  Mac/iOS (not
MonoTouch/.NET) devs seems to be a bunch of babies that fell on their head
at birth and are so insecure and negative.  Android users are positive
people and post completely polar opposite in reviews and appreciation.  Such
a difference in cultures.  It's a shame iOS is so successful when it was
born so completely unethical (ala Steve Jobs) and their insecure culture.
