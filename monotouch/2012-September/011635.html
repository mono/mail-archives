<PRE>Hi there

I've just had a chat to the Xamarin people (Joseph and Nat
specifically), and I was asking about the iOS6 issue which they have
been emailing everyone about. I'd heard (or assumed) slightly
conflicting things - eg &quot;it's a crashing issue!&quot; &quot;but my app doesn't
crash, am I ok?&quot; etc.

I've included the text below incase you didn't get it (twice). If you
have ever given your email address to Xamarin, you should have
received this. Twice.

Basically, it's a reference counting issue, so unless you profile your
app a _lot_, it's hard to tell if you are affected - until you are,
and then it all crashes. Not good at all. Best to assume you _are_
affected.

So, if your app is remotely important to you and your users, you NEED
to rebuild and resubmit with 5.2.13 (or the latest 5.3/5.4, which also
has the fix if you are comfortable with beta stuff). Even if the app
works with some testing (as most of mine do!), they are still leaking
memory, which is bad.

At the moment, the appstore is taking around 9 days to approve things,
so best get onto it ASAP. Also, jump on here:

<A HREF="http://reviewtimes.shinydevelopment.com/">http://reviewtimes.shinydevelopment.com/</A>

and on twitter: @appreviewtimes

and submit your times when you are approved. This then helps everyone.
That twitter handle tweets the average every day, so it's a handy
guide to talk you down the from &quot;why is my app taking so long&quot; ledge.

So:

Update. Recompile. Resubmit.

Go to it! :)

Cheers

URGENT REMINDER:  Rebuild and submit your MonoTouch app before iOS 6 release

Hello,

This email is to remind you that you need to rebuild and republish
your MonoTouch app with MonoTouch 5.2.13 because of an issue in
MonoTouch we uncovered while preparing for the iOS 6 launch. We expect
Apple to release iOS 6 on September 12th.

You can read more details about this issue here.

We first emailed you about this on August 13th, and we have heard from
many customers who have already successfully rebuilt and resubmitted.
If you haven&#8217;t already, this is your last chance! You may want to take
advantage of Apple&#8217;s expedited review process to ensure that your app
update makes it to the app store before the release of iOS 6.

To ensure that you continue to receive timely notifications of
critical technical issues, please subscribe to our critical issues
email list, and encourage anyone in your organization responsible for
building Xamarin apps to do the same.
