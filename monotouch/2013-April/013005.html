<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> What is the actual behavior you're seeing on the screen? Does the app
</I>&gt;<i> show up as expected, or does it exit?
</I>
I get a splash screen. It is then supposed to put up a message to say 
loading data (UIAlert) and then another UIAlert to say welcome. Now here 
is the reason why I think it was at runtime.

UIAlert #1 works. It doesn't use the LocalizedString code. UIAlert #2 
isn't hit, but what is happening is really odd. The LocalizedString is 
being called but looks to being called twice - once before 
FinishedLaunching has been executed, once after with the same token. 
This token is only ever used once (no replications of the token exist 
when I do a Search in Files other than in the Localized.strings file).

The mystery deepens!

vastly, hugely, mindbogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a 
long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to 
space, listen...&quot;
