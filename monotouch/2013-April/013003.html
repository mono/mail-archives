<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> There is always the low-tech solution of riddling your code with calls
</I>&gt;<i> to Console.WriteLine...
</I>
Did that too - AppDelegate ignored. Now something has just occurred to 
me and I'm not sure if it happens in monotouch as it does in monodroid.

When the compiler hits an event, the event code is read to ensure it's 
correct and working. For example

listView.Click += delegate {
if (condition)
  // do something
else
  // do something else
};

If the something else line goes out of bounds or does something silly, 
the compilation dies there.

What I'm wondering is if something similar is happening here except 
instead of it being at compile time, it's at runtime (the method is 
called before AppDelegate is reached when it shouldn't be reached until 
FinishedLaunching has been hit - in other words, the UI is starting 
before it's started officially)

Does/can that happen?

Paul
