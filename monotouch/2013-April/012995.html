<PRE>Hi,

Got an interesting problem here. I have the same app running on two 
identical machines with the same software and OS set ups (two Mac minis, 
the other one is the Australia)

The app has been developed on my machine, committed to svn and then 
brought down to the aussie box and built.

When I run the debugger here, the app fires through and picks things up 
correctly from AppDelegate for localisation. The one in Australia 
completely ignores AppDelegate. By that I mean none of the break points 
in AppDelegate are hit, they are on my box.

Is there any way to find why the flow is completely different between 
the machines?

The only difference between the the machines is that I have the 
simulators for iOS 5, 5.1 and 6 installed whereas the other box doesn't. 
When I build for 6.1, everything works at this end.

I've noticed some of the xib files are set for a target of iOS 3. Is 
this likely to be the issue?
