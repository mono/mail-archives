<PRE>Hi,

I'm having some fun and games with MTD and wondered if anyone could 
guide me on a couple of points.

I have a navigation controller set for the main app. This has the usual 
sort of things on it (namely a title and backbutton) and works fine. I 
have a settings view with the master MTD on. Simple enough to do

(in the controller that attaches the MTD)
dvc = new DialogViewController(null);
dvc.View.Frame = new RectangleF(0, 0, AppDelegate.Self.ScreenX, 
AppDelegate.Self.ScreenY);
usersettings user = new usersettings(this);
dvc.Root = user.Root;
View.AddSubview(dvc.View);

Problem is this. If I select an option on an MTD which has a sub MTD, 
the sub MTD appears under the navigation bar. How do I stop this from 
happening? I can pull the sub MTD down, but it bounces back up.

My next MTD question is changing the colour of text within a section.

Currently, I'm doing this

UITextView about = new UITextView();
about.TextColor = UIColor.Blue;
about.Text = StringUtils.GetString(&quot;UserSettings.MTD.About&quot;);
var aboutInner = new Section(about);

var sect2 = new Section()
{
     new RootElement(StringUtils.GetString(&quot;UserSettings.MTD.About&quot;)) 
{aboutInner,},
};

The text though is black and I'd like it to be blue. Is there a way to 
do this?

Next one is launching a new view from within an MTD. Say I have an MTD 
that needs to launch a non-MTD view. Is there a way to do this?

Lastly (gasps for breath!)

Can I attach the likes of a spinner selector to a MTD option?

The docs are good for but just seem to lack these bits. Sorry there are 
4 questions on one email, but MTDs are damned powerful!
