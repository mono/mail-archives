<PRE>Hi guys,

I'm also trying to figure this out.  Initially I was using 
GDiOS::Initialise() which seemed to work until I started trying to send
files to the GFE.  Also delegation to GFE was turned off, as soon as it was
turned on GFE and my App didn't want to play ball.  It transpired that I was
calling a deprecated method :: Initialise()

It sounds exactly the same problem as I'm now calling 
InitializeWithClassNameConformingToUIApplicationDelegate

This is the story so far:
<A HREF="https://community.good.com/message/18304?et=watches.email.thread#18304">https://community.good.com/message/18304?et=watches.email.thread#18304</A>

The binding has been setup as the below, which I believe is correct.

    [BaseType (typeof (UIApplicationDelegate))]
    [Model]
    interface GDiOSDelegate {
            [Abstract]
            [Export (&quot;handleEvent:&quot;)]
            void HandleEvent (GDAppEvent anEvent);

    }

and the AppDelegate.cs looks like this

[Register (&quot;AppDelegate&quot;)]
public partial class AppDelegate : GDiOSDelegate
{ ... }


.. and the call in Main.cs looks like this

GDiOS.InitializeWithClassNameConformingToUIApplicationDelegate(&quot;AppDelegate&quot;);

.. and then when you run it it blows with

2014-02-04 09:26:25.880 XamarinGood[39491:80b] [4027.105MB] [064%] [8] +
NSObject+UIApplicationDelegate::registerDelegateWithClass
2014-02-04 09:26:25.882 XamarinGood[39491:80b] *** Assertion failure in
+[GDUIApplicationDelegate registerDelegateWithClass:],
/Users/build-gd/jenkins_slave_node/workspace/Good_Apps_SDK_for_iOS_Release_Dave/dev/gd/dave-ios/msdk/platform/ios/NSObject+UIApplicationDelegate.mm:478

Or a call to GDiOS.InitializeWithClassConformingToUIApplicationDelegate(new
MonoTouch.ObjCRuntime.Class(typeof(AppDelegate))); will do the same thing
but these calls are essentially the same thing.

Can anyone confirm that they have got all this working?  At the moment, when
calling the Initialise() method I can get it to download files via GD Http
and also store files into the secure container.  However as mentioned this
doesn't work with delegating authentication to GFE or allow me to post files
to GFE.

I'd really appreciate any help on this as it's driving me nuts and I'm on
borrowed time.  :-o

Thanks in advance.

Steve
