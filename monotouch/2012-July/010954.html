<PRE>Hey guys, need some advice. Any help is extremely appreciated.

I'm still pretty new so bear with me.

I am working on a new app that uses an MKMapView. When the app opens, I have
it locate the user via the location services and plot their location as the
center of the map.  Next I make a call to a 3rd party web service to pull in
locations that need to be plotted around the user's location.  This would be
pretty similar to something like an app to locate gas/petrol stations around
your current location.

I have that all working.  However, I am confused on how to handle reloading
those data points when zooming in or out, or even panning, the map.  For now
I am focused on changing the zoom.  So, if I zoom out, I am not sure what
event to call my data point reload on. I tried using the RegionChanged
event, but I believe I got into a recursive loop. So can anyone tell me what
event I should be reloading my data on? 

Also, is there any easy way to get the current Zoom level?
Thanks!
Bob
