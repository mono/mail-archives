<PRE>Hi Adam

You really need a reply from Rolf or Sebastian, but they are in Boston
at the moment at the (annual?) company meetup. I've CCed them, but I
dont know how much spare time they have this week.

So, just so this doesn't drop off the bottom of the list, this SO item
from Miguel explains it well:

<A HREF="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5623223/no-constructor-found-for-viewcontroller-ctorsystem-intptr">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5623223/no-constructor-found-for-viewcontroller-ctorsystem-intptr</A>

I suspect that it might be a case where you need to keep a reference
to the object in a class-local variable, rather than a method-local
one or just assigning it to a (obj-c?) object.

I've never really implemented them, tho maybe I should :). I used to
have the same exceptions as this, but I've not seen it in live debug
logs for ages - it's possible that the GC got fixed (or improved)

Drop the list an email back if that doesn't answer your question

Cheers

Nic

</I>&gt;<i> The first question is what method is being called on view controller B,

</I>&gt;<i> invoked from objective-c on a managed object (0xB9E72D0) that has been
</I>&gt;<i> GC'ed&quot;, but it won't tell me which selector was invoked. In a simpler test
</I>&gt;<i> case that I created I could only reproduce the crash if I overrode either
</I>&gt;<i> DidReceiveMemoryWarning or ViewDidUnload, but in my full application I get
</I>&gt;<i> the crash even though I haven't implemented either. I don't understand
</I>&gt;<i> why. Is there a trick to figuring out which method is being invoked when
</I>&gt;<i> this exception occurs?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The second question is what are the rules for when we are expected to
</I>&gt;<i> implement the IntPtr constructor for classes that inherit from NSObject? I
</I>&gt;<i> don't want to blindly add it to every class, especially since in some
</I>&gt;<i> cases it probably can't be implemented in a sane way at all (the Dispose
</I>&gt;<i> method might have released resources that you can't get back without
</I>&gt;<i> arguments from a real constructor). Is there some rule for this? Does my
</I>&gt;<i> situation fit that rule?
</I>&gt;<i>
