<PRE>Old thread but..

I found today my memory villain. My MBP has 8GB of RAM (non-Apple memory),
but still always with almost 0 MB RAM free. After a reboot and new VMWare
Fusion configuration, now I'm 20 hours with 1GB FREE and 1,6GB inactive and
a really few disk cache (40MB).

Fusion has a default configuration (automatic) that makes Windows HD cache
on MacOS RAM, to let the VM to be more quick, but spend a lot of RAM and
it's become all the time inactive or something. On automatic it appear that
turn it on.

It's on Settings/Advanced/Hard Disk Buffering. I changed it to Disabled.

My VM run with Windows 7 64 bits, with 1.4GB of RAM and 1 processor (my pain
with 2 Duo Core MBP but..) and VM is on an external Firewire 800 Iomega
drive, using Visual Studio 2010 and/or 2008, 2 SQL Studio instances and
Internet Explorer. No lags today :)

Before that, on lesser than 1 day it always stay with almost no free RAM and
a lot of lags. And if I give to VM more than 1.4, like, 1.8 or 2GB, it
always has much unused free ram and MacOS do not like that.

Now I'm in the way to buy a 90GB SSD as a secondary disk (no so expensive)
just for VM (then windows can use all the cache that it whats, if needed).

Wow, impressed by the contributions to this.  It's really good to see and
hear what sort of setup you guys are using.  I'm surprised by the general
feeling to go for 16Gb RAM - as Apple RAM is soo expensive in the new
machines and non-upgradeable too :(  I was hoping just to get by with 8Gb
RAM, but that's probably because I have a dedicated Windows laptop as my
main development pc.  I then just RDP to this machine from my existing
Macbook (currently with only 3Gb RAM! but runs MonoDevelop without problem).

So I'm probably still going to go for a 13&quot; MBA.  But then again, the
reviews and feedback I'm reading about the Retina display is swaying me.
I've not seen one in the flesh yet, but imaging it's probably like viewing
high defintion tv - everything in single definition looks rubbish once
you've been spoiled.

Thanks,
