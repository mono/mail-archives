<PRE>I sent this yesterday to the list but then never saw it posted so am resending it.
=====
I noticed an issue in using an UIActionSheet in combination with a UIImagePickerController and thought I'd shared what I've seen and a work around.  I ported some working code from Xcode to MonoTouch and got a crash with &quot;Application tried to present modally an active controller&quot;.  The use case is a UIActionSheet displaying 2-3 buttons and then from the UIActionSheet.Clicked event displaying a UIImagePickerController.

On the first call from the ActionSheet to the ImagePicker it works fine all the way through the cancel from the image picker.  However, the second time I make the call it fails when trying to display the UIImagePickerController with the above mentioned error.

One thing I did in comparing my Xcode vs MT code is that I was using the Clicked event on the action sheet vs the action sheet delegate method didDismissWithButtonIndex.  I decided to write a simple delegate class and override the Dismissed method.  Now my code works with no errors.

Is there a difference in how the delegate Dismissed method works vs the Clicked event?  You would think they'd behave the same but it appears that they do not.

Thanks.
Gerry
