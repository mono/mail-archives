<PRE>GC issues are about the hardest to troubleshoot to be honest, given the
developer's complete lack of control and tools.

However, given that I have encountered *many* issues with SGen GC that were
resolved with disabling it, with a significantly large application, I'd
suggest looking away from GC itself and considering how you are
instantitating and referencing your variables and instances.

Lots of &quot;inline&quot; handlers (ala lambda expressions) and/or locals declared in
a local scope (for what should be considered long-term persistence) &quot;may&quot;
cause problems in the IOS/MT realm where such practices would not represent
an issue in the Windows realm.

Other than disabling SGen, I did go through my problematic modules long ago
(before becoming familiar with the above issues) and moved much to
class-scope declaration, which seemed to fix my problems.  I would use a
debug/simulator or debug/iphone build that did not use SGen, where my
partner (tester) would use a release version with SGen and he would
encounter crashes I simply could not reproduce.  Definitely an issue with
SGen - however, class-level declaration may be a solution you could
investigate.
