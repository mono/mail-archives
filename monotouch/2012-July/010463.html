<PRE>
My app launches a webview from my MainViewController. Everything works
great, but when the webview is pushed to the view controller, the new view
appears and is blank for a couple seconds while the website in question
loads. I thought it would be nice to have a UIActivityIndicator pop up when
the webview is pushed and then disappear when the site loads. So I wrote a
class for my activity indicator, and it works and the activity indicator
looks very nice. 

My problem is that I haven't found the right place to put the method that
activates the indicator or the method that makes it go away. Either the
indicator is on the screen for a split second and then we get the blank view
and then the site loads (original issue unresolved), or we get the blank
view and then a split second of activity indicator right before the website
appears, or I get the activity indicator and then it never goes away (the
dismiss method doesn't get called). It feels like the indicator ought to be
created and appear on screen either right before or right after the webview
is pushed in my MainViewController and then dismissed in the other view's
ViewDidLoad method, but I have no idea how to pull that off (or if that's
even the right answer).

I've found examples online that show how to accomplish what I've already
pulled off, but not one that shows how to achieve the implementation goal
I'm trying to achieve, or that solves the problems I've having. 

Any advice on how to properly make an activity indicator do what I'm trying
to do?
