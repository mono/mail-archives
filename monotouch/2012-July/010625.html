<PRE>Hello and Greetings.

As part of my sample application that I am trying to develop, I am working
on a module which I will describe in detail. It is a bit tricky and I need
all the help in terms of code blocks and tutorials in order to implement
this successfully. There's a module called Assessment where a user will be
allowed to assess the quality of a product supplied to him [it could be
anything ranging from building materials, to cloth to wooden furniture.]

The totality of the product will be represented by an empty vertical bar.
The user will touch a small button placed at the foot of this bar and this
will keep filling the initially empty bar with green color. The level upto
which the bar will be filled with this green indicator will ultimately
represent the quality of the product in percentage. And the reading will be
shown on a label on the screen.

Something like this --&gt;

Now I have no shame in admitting that this is beyond my scope right at this
point of time, my experience in MonoTouch being just 37 days worth. I really
need to get this done. Difficult as it is, it's a very interesting and
absorbing part of my sample project. I hope I have been able to convey my
requirement to you clearly. 

Looking forward to receive all the help from our forum members. /You may
have to guide me through every step of the process, if need be. I'll be
grateful if someone corresponds with me regularly and helps me do this
module.

Many Thanks.
