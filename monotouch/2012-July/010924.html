<PRE>Hello and greetings.

I want to build a very small application which will allow a user to take
pictures with iphone camera, save it somewhere on the device and provide an
option to upload it to a destined location on a web server.

As of now I am searching for code blocks for taking pictures with iphone
camera. Most of the examples I came across were in Objective C which is of
no use to me. I want to use C# and MonoTouch. Can anybody help me with some
code blocks or links to pertinent articles/tutorials which do the same? It
would help me immensely. From what I picked from the internet I think it
could be done with a UIImageView control and some delegate defined. I maybe
wrong though.

Please help me by steering me in the right direction.


Many Thanks in anticipation.
