<PRE>
My stakeholders now want an HTML-style image map -- a map of counties
divided into regions, where tapping on a region brings up a list of counties
in that region (I already have all that functionality working as a table
view. The image map idea is pretty good, though.) The regions, each one a
collection of counties, is like a jigsaw puzzle piece in outline.

I have a public domain map of all the counties in question. What I'd like to
do is use the map image (with each region having a different fill color for
all the counties in that region) and then draw the region outline using Core
Graphics custom drawn shapes with a transparent stroke and fill, and then
use an appropriate event handler when a shape is tapped. 

I have a couple concerns about this approach. First, I've only used images
in images views and custom buttons so far, and I've drawn shapes with simple
CG techniques. But I don't know how to combine a UIImageView with a CG
drawing context. Is there a way to do that and then draw the shapes over the
image view? Or do I need to place the image in the CG drawing and then draw
the shapes over that image? How is that done? 

My second concern is drawing the region shapes themselves. I'm envisioning a
lot of painstaking point-by-point trial and error between the code and the
simulator for review. (I'm doing everything programmatically and not using
IB at all in this project.) Is there an easier way to go about this?
