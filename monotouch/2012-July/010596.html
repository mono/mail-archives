<PRE>A bit more on facilitating multi-gesture recognition...  As with most things,
when trying to c# IOS, some objective-C interpretation skill is required. 
Hope the below makes sense.  Basically, you attach one recognizer as an
observer of another - I ran into a similar problem long ago - unfortunately,
I didn't save the code for handling it as I found a different solution -
this comes from the Apple docs...  It is possible with MT, hoping this is a
point in the right direction for you.

Permitting Simultaneous Gesture Recognition

By default, no two gesture recognizers can attempt to recognize their
gestures simultaneously. But you can change this behavior by implementing
gestureRecognizer:shouldRecognizeSimultaneouslyWithGestureRecognizer:, an
optional method of the UIGestureRecognizerDelegate protocol. This method is
called when the recognition of the receiving gesture recognizer would block
the operation of the specified gesture recognizer, or vice versa. Return YES
to allow both gesture recognizers to recognize their gestures
simultaneously.
