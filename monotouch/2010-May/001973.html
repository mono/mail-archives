<PRE>I realise I'm probably doing something wrong - but I can't figure out what.

The iTunes Connect is telling me:

&quot;The binary you uploaded was invalid. A pre-release beta version of the SDK
was used to build the application.&quot;

as I try to upload an app binary. I've downloaded the latest 3.2 SDK (*not*
4.0). Is it the MT version? I didn't think I had a non-release version of
that either... :-s

What else have I screwed up?
