<PRE>I have an app for iPad, which is of 80 MB size on device. Earlier during 2013
start it used to run a particular operation with same time on device and
simulator(4 secs). I made a lot of modifications to improve speed during all
these months. And also kept upgrading new versions of xamarin and X-code as
they came. Now the problem is this app takes 2 secs for same operation on
simulator while it takes 10 secs on device for the same.

Really confused about what is wrong, as before modifications uglier code ran
about 4 secs. Now the best code i could do runs at 10 secs on device. Also i
noticed that LLVM option in build does not make any difference to the
output(where as it is supposed to make). 

Please let me know if this is known issue, where code runs slower on
device.(As the normal conditions for others is code runs faster on device
normally)

Most confused about LLVM not making any difference to the output and device
taking 5 times longer for the same operation than Simulator.
