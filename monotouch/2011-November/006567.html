<PRE>
I  have a serious issue with my app on IOS 5 and was wondering if anyone has seen similar problems or has any ideas. My app is over a year old now and has worked without issues for most of that time on IOS 4.X. The app allow free form navigation through data pushing views on to the navigation stack. Prior to IOS 5 I could navigate without issue to a depth of many many levels.

Now when I push the third view controller the app gets a low memory warning and is killed. I tried disposing and nulling out the class members in the controllers that are off screen in the did recieve memory warning method but to no avail.

There was a lot changed in one go IOS, monodevelop and mtouch all updated. So I really am unsure where the issue lies.

I am testing this on a ipad v1, I build armv7 only and linked to SDK
