<PRE>We are considering using an Objective-C framework written for CocoaTouch, but
how easy it would be to use the framework in MT is a big consideration. If
we decide to license it, the creators are kind enough to provide full source
code containing a few dozen classes and more than 5 delegate protocols, but
has stated they would not support MT development, so we would need to do the
binding ourselves. 

I have read the documentation on binding Obj-C, but find some concepts
unfamiliar, so I'd like to ask some clarifying questions:
- Is the API definition file to be created for each class, or just once for
the whole framework?

- Do we need to create API definition files for every single class and
protocol upfront, or can we just handle classes we need to use in our MT
projects?

- The documentation states &quot;if you are binding APIs that are not part of
your application, you need to make sure that your executable is linked
against these libraries.&quot; Since we would have the source code of this
framework, does it mean we can just include it in our project and save
linking dependencies? How is including Obj-C code done in this case?
