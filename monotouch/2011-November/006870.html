<PRE>Hi,

(Reposting this as it did not show up in the list)

I have ios SDK 5 installed, nothing else. I'm using MT5.0.2. My selected
SDK is 5, my deployment target is 4.3, my test devices are iOS 5 and iOS
4.3.5

Now: I add a s controller's view as subview to a view of another
controller. If I run the code on an iOS 5 device, ViewWillAppear() triggers
for the controller whose view gets added.
Running the same on an iOS 4 device does not trigger it.

As I want to support 4.3 and want the event handlers to be called I will
have to trigger them manually. But this will trigger them twice on ios 5 if
I do not run a version check before my calls.

Now I'm wondering: if I reinstall SDK 4.3 and build my app using that, will
it behave identically on both devices or will I still have the issue
because one device is 5 and the other is 4.3? Or is the actual version of
the OS of no meaning in this scenario?

What role does the actual OS version play?
And: what role does the SDK play I build with? Is it just a bunch of .h
files so the compiler knows what methods are available? I mean, the actual
code of let's say &quot;addSubView:&quot; is the one that is on the target device's
OS and is not part of my application or the SDK I'm building with, correct?

Gr&#252;&#223;e, Ren&#233;
