<PRE>I'm not sure if this will help you, but I was getting crashes that only showed up on the device, as well.

Adding the following lines to the iPhone Build - &quot;Additional mtouch arguments&quot; section, fixed my problem:


-aot &quot;ntrampolines=2048&quot; -aot &quot;nrgctx-trampolines=2048&quot; -aot &quot;nimt-trampolines=512&quot;

Subject: [MonoTouch] Unable to debug on device anymore

Hi,

To be more quick I develop on simulator, then at the end make real tests on device without debug. But today I got an exception just on device, and trying to debug it crashes on startup due to the excessive time that the application is taking to talk with debugger.

Is there a way to make debug more quickly? I can't find debugger options on MonoDevelop as I saw on <A HREF="http://docs.xamarin.com/ios/getting_started/debugging">http://docs.xamarin.com/ios/getting_started/debugging</A> at the end of the page to try whatever options...

I got log from device by xcode and log by terminal to try to understand what can be but I didn't begin my internship on Xamarin yet to understand it.

Any help to improve debugging?

Thanks,

Karl
