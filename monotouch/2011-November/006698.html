<PRE>Hello everyone,

Recently I posted a problem with my LocationServices.. and I fixed that.
But the solution wasn't quite nice and I decided to make my class + method
static so I can request location + the setted value from every class that
needs it..

Well, I done that but it wasn't quite a success.. for some reason the
LocationServices doesn't get enabled (I don't see the purply arrow thingy
for example).
If I'm setting a breakpoint in my AppDelegate FinishedLaunching method
where I call the LocationService method then it goes inside the method and
handles: locationManager.StartUpdatingLocation();  but the delegate of
UpdatedLocation doesn't get called so also doesn't get set.

The class + method which handles the location: <A HREF="http://pastebin.com/4jmFXq0w">http://pastebin.com/4jmFXq0w</A>
The way I call this in my FinishedLaunching Method(In Appdelegate:
LocationHelper.GetForCurrentLocation();

I hope someone with a better point of view and experience is able to
provide me with the right information to get this fixed. I really
appreciate any effort from anyone who tries to help me with this situation.
I have been sitting way to long on this typical problem and really need
someone to check it out with me.

Thanks in advance.

Greetings,
Mittchel
