<PRE>I keep experiencing lockups when running in the simulator (I'm not running on
a device yet). The lockups are complete: I cannot break execution, but the
stop button does return MonoDevelop to edit mode. The simulator stays locked
up with my app's last screen on, and cannot be used until I've quit and
restarted it.

The problem seems to happen most often, for some reason, when I've got a
WebClient performing tasks in the background (it goes off and obtains
internet resources with DownloadData and its async counterpart). I have
verified to the best of my ability that none of my code is affecting this: I
can break before the call to DownloadData, but once called, it's a complete
lockup. This problem is obviously dependent of the overall state of the rest
of my application because I absolutely cannot reproduce it in a new problem
with a WebClient.

Interestingly, if I launch my app by going to Run With -&gt; iPad Simulator,
the issue does not happen. It only happens when running with the Mono Soft
Debugger.

I suppose my question is, what is usually the problem that causes sim
lockups of such severity? Some extensive Googling revealed that there had
been some problems with WebClient in Mono which sounded familiar but it
looks like those were fixed before v5 which I'm running.

Thanks!
