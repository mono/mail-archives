<PRE>But I guess I will not be able to submit my app then...AFAIK Apple requires
you to use the latest SDK, or am I wrong?

In to get a bit more details and to stick with my example: where is the code
of UIView.AddSubview()? Is it part of the app I compile or is it always a
call to the operating system? If it&#146;s part of the app I wonder how a simple
ObjC app can be 50kb or less.

But if it is not, why and how could it matter which SDK I&#146;m using when
building?

Hi Ren&#233;,

 

It's not easy to have a general rule for differences between iOS versions or
differences between SDK versions. The logical assumption is that installing
an app built with 4.3 on an iOS5 device should still work - but there are of
course exceptions to this assumption (which can be both bugs in iOS5,
MonoTouch or actually documented behavior). This means that an app built
with the 4.3 SDK will generally work identically on iOS 4.3 and 5.

 

HoweverI find that the easiest way to figure it out is to try it yourself:
install the 4.3 SDK and build with it to see what happens. My guess is that
you'll see the same behavior on both iOS5 and 4.3 devices, but it's still
just a guess..

 

I hope this helps,

Rolf

Hi,

I have ios SDK 5 installed, nothing else.
I'm using MT5.0.2.
My selected SDK is 5, my deployment target is 4.3

Now: I add a s controller's view as subview to a view of another controller.
If I run the code on an iOS 5 device, ViewWillAppear() triggers for the
controller whose view gets added.
Running the same on an iOS 4 device does not trigger it.

As I want to support 4.3 and want the event handlers to be called I will
have to trigger them manually. But this will trigger them twice on ios 5 if
I do not run a version check before my calls.

Now I'm wondering: if I reinstall SDK 4.3 and build my app using that, will
it behave identically on both devices or will I still have the issue because
one device is 5 and the other is 4.3? Or is the actual version of the OS of
no meaning in this scenario?

What role does the actual OS version play?

Gr&#252;&#223;e, Ren&#233;
