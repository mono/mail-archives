<PRE>I recently upgraded my application from 3.X to 5.X I had to make a few
changes to the recorder to get the recording working, but I have tried
everything I can think of to make the AudioPlayer() work and it keeps SIGDEV
hard crashing on the simulator AND the device. This totally worked fine
before I have reverted back to 3.X to make sure it still works and it does.
I even put the AudioPlayer in a Singleton Globals static class to see if
that helps and it doesnt :(

The wierd thing is that if I set a breakpoint IN the Async callback from the
WebService it will play fine.

As soon as I let it continue it will SIGDEV.  ANY HELP WOULD BE GREATLY
APPRECIATED! I also wrapping in in an InvokeOnMainThread() to see if that
helped and nothing too :(


What I do is call a WebService that returns a byte[].  when I get that data
I do the following:

//Store the resulting byte[] into a FileStream and save it here

......

//Now lets play the file!
Globals.AudioPlayer = new AudioPlayer();
Globals.AudioPlayer = AVAudioPlayer.FromUrl(NSUrl.FromFilename(sfile +
&quot;.wav&quot;));
Globals.AudioPlayer.PrepareToPlay();
Globals.AudioPlayer.MeteringEnabled = true;
Globals.Audioplayer.FinishedPlaying += HandlePlayerFinishedPlaying;


Globals.AudioPlayer.Play();
