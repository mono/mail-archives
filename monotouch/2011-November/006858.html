<PRE>&gt;<i> Will Monotouch exists in a year (or two)?
</I>
No idea. I'd say yes, but who knows? It's all about risk management.

&gt;<i> What if Xamarin/Monotouch bankrupts and stops realeasing new versions? Will
</I>&gt;<i> our projects die?
</I>
No, not immediately. They will still work for as long as they work...
you might not be able to release a new version in some situations tho.

&gt;<i> Does Monotouch go hand in hand with Xcode? I guess that a Monotouch release
</I>&gt;<i> for iOS5 will not work with an Xcode release for iOS6?
</I>
Not really. Xcode goes hand in hand with some iOS versions, but only
in that Apple will only accept apps which are built with the latest
API version.

&gt;<i> Should we be concerned?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm not. But you might be. I'm not betting my business on it. But if I
was in the position to, I most likely would.

&gt;<i> I see a very buggy MonoDevelop - often I can't click buttons, set
</I>&gt;<i> breakpoints etc. Bugs that should have been fixed long time ago/right away.
</I>
I hope you have reported all of those....? MonoDevelop is a weak
point, however it's a LOT better than it was, and getting better and
better with each release.

&gt;<i> Help file is crashing ... documentation is extremely limited. It makes me
</I>&gt;<i> worry about the effort put into MonoDevelop/touch. How many is working on
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop/Touch?
</I>
I'm not sure - Miguel would be able to answer that. However, they are
also only 6 months or so old. They have released a MASSIVE block of
docs (<A HREF="http://docs.xamarin.com/ios">http://docs.xamarin.com/ios</A>), and from what I know have 4 or 5
people just writing docs (not sure if that MT and MfA, or just MT).
I'd expect them to have a lot more dev's than that.

In fact, I can think of 8 off the top of my head who post on here, and
from time to time, someone says &quot;oh, you need to get X to do that&quot;,
and I've not heard of X before (or again....) so I suspect there are a
load more &quot;in the background&quot;. And then there is support (2 or 3)
and.....

It's not an especially small company, and I think it's rather bigger
than it appears too. Plus, from what Nat has said, they were
profitable from when they started selling MT/MfA.....

&gt;<i> I really do hope MonoDevelop will exists for a long time (as long as Apple
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't do anything stupid) and a lotta effort will be put into it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm not worried. Worst case, I now know the apple api's really well,
and I have a massive start in Obj-C. Best case: I can write a full iOS
app in 20% of the time, and then port the backend (not the UI) to
Android and WP7 in a morning.

As Jason pointed out (I think!), I'm not at all worried about Xamarin
screwing up and blowing up - Nat, Miguel and Joseph have proven they
have a clue.

Now, Apple screwing over all tool vendors, including Xamarin? Unlikely
now (they have done it once already, and are unlikely to go back on
it), but more possible.
