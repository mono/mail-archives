<PRE>I sympathize with your anxiety.  Those of us who committed to MT early on
had many sleepless nights this year as we waited for the Attachmate/Xamarin
drama to play out.

However, there is a risk in adopting any platform.  I can easily list a
dozen technologies supported by huge companies that were allowed to die, or
killed outright, leaving their dev communities in the lurch.  Just a few
months ago WebOS was a promising new platform enthusiastically supported by
HP - now it's dead, or nearly so.

I don't have any insight into Xamarin's inner workings.  But I know that
they're lead by two guys (Nate and Miguel) who have a track record of
success.  And they have a team of very smart people who are actively
involved in the community.  So I don't think there is any near-term risk of
them failing.  Long term, who knows?  Nobody can predict the future.

As far ask keeping up with Apple's releases, the team has a really good
track record.  MT 5 was released the same day as iOS 5.  Past MT releases
typically happened within days of the corresponding iOS release.
