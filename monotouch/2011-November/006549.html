<PRE>Thank you for the tips Dino!! I finally got a workaround in place and
working. The Preserve attribute gave me big hopes, but still couldn't get it
to work while I had the [Serializable] attribute. Here is what I did:

- I left my existing model without the [Serializable] attribute. It now has
[Preserve (AllMembers = true)]

- I create a new class with the exact same signature, called it &quot;People&quot; and
decorated it with [Serializable].

[Serializable] 
public class People { 
 string _description; 
 string _firstName; 
 string _lastName; 
  
 public string Description { 
  get { return _description; } 
  set { _description = value; } 
  } 

 public string FirstName { 
  get { return _firstName; } 
  set { _firstName = value; } 
 } 

 public string LastName { 
  get { return _lastName; } 
  set { _lastName = value; } 
  }

} 

Next when I'm ready to persist to the file I iterate the PeopleModel list
inside a foreach, create a new class from the serializable and add it to a
new list.

List&lt;People&gt; peopleList = new List&lt;People&gt;();
foreach (PeopleModel item in persons) {
 People people = new People {
   Description = item.Description,
   LastName = item.LastName,
   FirstName = item.FirstName
 };
 peopleList.Add(people);
}

... and then reverse the process when I serialize it from the binary file.

Sure would be nice to know what the issue is (or was), but at least it's
working and I can move on to the next frustration 

Thanks again for the tips.
