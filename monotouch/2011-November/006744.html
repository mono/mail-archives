<PRE>Hi,

 

I&#146;ve posted this on SO but I think it is too special to be discussed there,
so I&#146;m trying it over here.

 

I'm experiencing crashes when running my app on iOS5. The code constellation
I have:

 

&#183;         UIViewController A has an event &quot;InputEnded&quot;.

&#183;         UIViewController B adds A's view as a subview and attaches to
InputEnded.

&#183;         In InputEnded, B removes A's view from super view, removes the
event handlers, disposes A and sets it to NULL.

 

In iOS 4.3 this works as expected, however A's ViewDidDisappear() is never
called, but that's okay and according to Apple&#146;s docs.

 

In iOS 5 however, A's ViewDidDisappear() DOES trigger. It gets fired some
point later in time. But the issue is: it fires even though A is already
disposed (Handle == 0) and hence it will crash!

 

In both, A and B I override bool
AutomaticallyForwardAppearanceAndRotationMethodsToChildViewControllers and
return FALSE to keep the same behavior as I see in iOS 4.3 but appearently
it will always call its *own* ViewDidDisappear(), no matter what you return,
so there does not seem to be a way to get the 4.3 behavior back. My solution
is now to NOT dispose anymore and let GC do it but I don&#146;t  like that.

 

Can somebody explain what is going on here and how to overcome it?

 

Ren&#233;
