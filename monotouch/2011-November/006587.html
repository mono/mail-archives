<PRE>Hi Rene

Your second point is interesting because I added some really ugly 'react to the memory warning code' that disposed and nulled all content in the view controllers that are off screen. I then call system.GC.Collect() for generations 1 to 3. This still has no effect. Do you know if there is any way to really force garbage collection?

My last information is that with iOS 5 you actually have less memory available. It simply consumes more RAM.
The second thing is that I read is that Apple changed the memory warning behavior: you get one warning and if you don't react, your app will be killed. But this one warning will come later than in previous iOS versions, where it fired level 1, 2 and 3 warnings before killing you.

Betreff: [MonoTouch] Problems with ios 5?


I  have a serious issue with my app on IOS 5 and was wondering if anyone has seen similar problems or has any ideas. My app is over a year old now and has worked without issues for most of that time on IOS 4.X. The app allow free form navigation through data pushing views on to the navigation stack. Prior to IOS 5 I could navigate without issue to a depth of many many levels.

Now when I push the third view controller the app gets a low memory warning and is killed. I tried disposing and nulling out the class members in the controllers that are off screen in the did recieve memory warning method but to no avail.

There was a lot changed in one go IOS, monodevelop and mtouch all updated. So I really am unsure where the issue lies.

I am testing this on a ipad v1, I build armv7 only and linked to SDK
