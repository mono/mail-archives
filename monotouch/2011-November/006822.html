<PRE>I have the same issue sometimes - the app will just hang on my login screen, but at the time I don't think I have any web service calls happening. It's already executed the first call, and is waiting for user input before making the second call. Happens maybe 30% of the time. Stopping and starting the app in Mono usually fixes it, and I get a dialog saying the debugger may have disconnected.

Subject: [MonoTouch] Simulator Lockups

I keep experiencing lockups when running in the simulator (I'm not running on a device yet). The lockups are complete: I cannot break execution, but the stop button does return MonoDevelop to edit mode. The simulator stays locked up with my app's last screen on, and cannot be used until I've quit and restarted it.

The problem seems to happen most often, for some reason, when I've got a WebClient performing tasks in the background (it goes off and obtains internet resources with DownloadData and its async counterpart). I have verified to the best of my ability that none of my code is affecting this: I can break before the call to DownloadData, but once called, it's a complete lockup. This problem is obviously dependent of the overall state of the rest of my application because I absolutely cannot reproduce it in a new problem with a WebClient.

Interestingly, if I launch my app by going to Run With -&gt; iPad Simulator, the issue does not happen. It only happens when running with the Mono Soft Debugger.

I suppose my question is, what is usually the problem that causes sim lockups of such severity? Some extensive Googling revealed that there had been some problems with WebClient in Mono which sounded familiar but it looks like those were fixed before v5 which I'm running.

Thanks!
