<PRE>I really could use some help with this one. I keep seeing this message for
each property in my class:
&quot;the requested operation cannot be completed because the object has been
garbage collected.&quot;

I have a web request I invoke which returns me a json object. In my case
it's a list. The strange thing is
it's worked a few times. I can inspect the request and I see the data
correctly, the moment I deserialize the response to a type list, I see 9
records of nothing. I've seen some bug reports within the Monoframe work,
not sure if they're valid. Is there a workaround or better solution? Here is
my code:

In my web service:
StreamReader results = new StreamReader(answer);
string peopleData = results.ReadToEnd();

// everything is fine until I get here, once it's serialized from Json, I
have 9 records with null properties.
List&lt;PeopleModel&gt; people =
DataHelper.SerializeFromJson&lt;List&amp;lt;PeopleModel&gt;&gt;(peopleData);

The Model:
[Serializable]
public class PeopleModel {
 string _description;
 string _firstName;
 string _lastName;
 
 public string Description {
  get { return _description; }
  set { _description = value; }
  }

 public string FirstName {
  get { return _firstName; }
  set { _firstName = value; }
 }

 public string LastName {
  get { return _lastName; }
  set { _lastName = value; }
  }

}

Just thought of something while typing all this in, I have other methods in
my web service returning similar list of models, the only difference is this
I recently decorated with [Serializable] because I wanted to persist it to a
binary file after retrieval from the web service. Could that be making the
GC want to collect it prematurely?
