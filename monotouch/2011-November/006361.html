<PRE>We submitted two apps developed with the 4.3 SDK, a 'lite' (free, but with ads)
version, and a pro version (paying).

The first reviewed app was the free version, and was rejected:
[quote]

We found that your app crashed on iPhone 4 running iOS 5, which is not in
compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines.

Your app crashed on both Wi-Fi and cellular networks when we:

When user:
- launches app , a crash is produced
[unquote]

So we assumed that the paying version would also be rejected, and upgraded our
Xcode and our test device to iOS5 to see what was up.

Before we were ready to try the free version on iOS5, we got confirmation from
Apple that the pro version was accepted. It is now up for sale.

So we figured it had to do something with libGoogleAdMobs: that's the only
difference between the two apps. All ad-related code is only compiled and
linked in the free version, and the pro version seems to be doing allright.

But, since we are running iOS5 on the iPhone, we can't install these apps to the
iPhone, neither the release nor the debug version. The deploy to device says:

Installation failed: AMDeviceInstallApplication returned: 0xe8008019
The application was terminated by a signal: SIGHUP

And the console window says:

Nov  3 15:03:04 unknown installd[1184] &lt;Error&gt;: 00381000
verify_signer_identity: Could not copy validate signature: -402620391
Nov  3 15:03:04 unknown installd[1184] &lt;Error&gt;: 00381000

install_application: Could not preflight application install
Nov  3 15:03:04 unknown mobile_installation_proxy[1183] &lt;Error&gt;:
handle_install: Installation failed
Nov  3 15:03:04 unknown installd[1184] &lt;Error&gt;: 00381000
handle_install: API failed
Nov  3 15:03:04 unknown installd[1184] &lt;Error&gt;: 00381000 send_message:

Nov  3 15:03:04 unknown installd[1184] &lt;Error&gt;: 00381000 send_error:
Could not send error response to client

We have older native ObjC apps that were created with Xcode 3.x versions. We
converted these apps to Xcode 4.2 project format, iOS5 SDK, and they install
fine on the test device. We did add some functionality and submitted a next
version. These were accepted and are available.

All apps use the same developer certificate and team provisioning profile. The
console log seems to indicate a signing problem, but the MonoDevelop apps use
the same profiles as the Xcode apps.

Could there be some problem with the MonoTouch part of the installation
process? We doubt it, while then there would much more noise about it.

Can anybody shed some light here, or suggest ways to investiate or solve this
problem?

To round up: we're successful in installing from within Xcode, but we fail to
install from within MonoDevelop using the very same certificate and profile.
The latter fails in 'Automatic' mode as well as with specifically selecting the
only certificate and profile.

Our app has been rejected, and we cannot install it anymore on the test device!
(Oh, we forgot to mention that these apps install and run fine on the
iPhoneSimulator)

Please advise,


Guido
