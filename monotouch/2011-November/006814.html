<PRE>Hello, I'm fairly new to MonoTouch/iOS development.

I'm creating an application that has a canvas from which the user can launch
a context menu to inspect items on that canvas. When it needs to be
launched, I create a root UINavigationController to handle everything that
goes on in the popup, the UIPopoverController itself (using its constructor
that accepts my navigation controller) then push the first actual menu into
the navigation controller. This all works fine.

This popup is somewhat hierarchical, so when the user selection an option
(the main views are all tables) other views are pushed into the root
controller.

I'm trying to play nicely and not allocate more than I need to, so I keep
the references to these three items (popover, navigation controller and the
first view) around. That means that when the user dismisses the popover and
subsequently shows it (for a different canvas object) it'll be re-used.
However this appears to lead to serious problems: if I open the popup, push
to a new view controller within it, dismiss it, then attempt to open it
again, I get something about SIGSEV in the debug window, telling me that
there's likely a problem within MonoTouch or a native library I'm using (I'm
not using any). Except that sometimes this doesn't happen, sometimes it's
fine.

Should I not be so bothered by this memory management and simply throw away
my references, creating a new popup and controller every time it's needed?
Will MonoTouch nicely dispose of all the views I created and pushed? I tried
hooking the DidDismiss event of the popover and disposing of everything
myself in that method, but then I got exceptions indicating that things had
been disposed which should not have been disposed.

I guess a lot of this comes from my uncertainty as to what MonoTouch is
automatically cleaning up.

Thanks!
