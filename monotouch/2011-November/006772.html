<PRE>Hi there,

Please forgive the n00b question, but I am new to MonoTouch and this forum.

I am about to start developing my first iPhone app and am evaluating
MonoTouch as a development platform.

I have a small but bright &amp; dedicated team of developers, but we shall
probably need some outside help in developing our app ... probably for the
first few weeks/months of the project until we are comfortable with the
development platform and iOS development generally.

Are there any Melbourne-based MonoTouch developers/contractors that are
available to provide that help and guidance during the initial stages of our
project?

How good is the support for developers that are new to the platform, and iOS
development generally?

How big is the MonoTouch online community?  And how quick are responses to
technical questions, should we encounter a tricky issue in development that
we aren't able to solve ourselves?

Thanks in advance,
Stu
