<PRE>This was caused by an AfterBuild command modifying the app's Info.plist
This command is executed after the codesign phase, so that causes problems
Sorry for the noise.

&gt;<i> We submitted two apps developed with the 4.3 SDK, a 'lite' (free, but with ads)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The first reviewed app was the free version, and was rejected:
</I>&gt;<i> [quote]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We found that your app crashed on iPhone 4 running iOS 5, which is not in
</I>&gt;<i> compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your app crashed on both Wi-Fi and cellular networks when we:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When user:
</I>&gt;<i> - launches app , a crash is produced
</I>&gt;<i> [unquote]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So we assumed that the paying version would also be rejected, and upgraded our
</I>&gt;<i> Xcode and our test device to iOS5 to see what was up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Before we were ready to try the free version on iOS5, we got confirmation from
</I>&gt;<i> Apple that the pro version was accepted. It is now up for sale.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So we figured it had to do something with libGoogleAdMobs: that's the only
</I>&gt;<i> difference between the two apps. All ad-related code is only compiled and
</I>&gt;<i> linked in the free version, and the pro version seems to be doing allright.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But, since we are running iOS5 on the iPhone, we can't install these apps to the
</I>&gt;<i> iPhone, neither the release nor the debug version. The deploy to device says:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Installation failed: AMDeviceInstallApplication returned: 0xe8008019
</I>&gt;<i> The application was terminated by a signal: SIGHUP
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And the console window says:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nov &#160;3 15:03:04 unknown installd[1184] &lt;Error&gt;: 00381000
</I>&gt;<i> verify_signer_identity: Could not copy validate signature: -402620391

</I>&gt;<i> Could not send error response to client
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have older native ObjC apps that were created with Xcode 3.x versions. We
</I>&gt;<i> converted these apps to Xcode 4.2 project format, iOS5 SDK, and they install
</I>&gt;<i> fine on the test device. We did add some functionality and submitted a next
</I>&gt;<i> version. These were accepted and are available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All apps use the same developer certificate and team provisioning profile. The
</I>&gt;<i> console log seems to indicate a signing problem, but the MonoDevelop apps use
</I>&gt;<i> the same profiles as the Xcode apps.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could there be some problem with the MonoTouch part of the installation
</I>&gt;<i> process? We doubt it, while then there would much more noise about it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can anybody shed some light here, or suggest ways to investiate or solve this
</I>&gt;<i> problem?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To round up: we're successful in installing from within Xcode, but we fail to
</I>&gt;<i> install from within MonoDevelop using the very same certificate and profile.
</I>&gt;<i> The latter fails in 'Automatic' mode as well as with specifically selecting the
</I>&gt;<i> only certificate and profile.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our app has been rejected, and we cannot install it anymore on the test device!
</I>&gt;<i> (Oh, we forgot to mention that these apps install and run fine on the
</I>&gt;<i> iPhoneSimulator)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please advise,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
