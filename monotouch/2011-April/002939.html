<PRE>Hi,

Working with MonoTouch.Dialog, I'm trying to get a reference to the 
tapped StringElement (so that I can get the .Value therein). I'm 
crawling over the NSAction Tapped() call which has no parameter.

I was thinking that I'd just ask the DialogViewController what is 
tapped. Seems like there's quite a bit involved, tho.



I found this reference:

<A HREF="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5700406/monotouch-dialog-which-element-was-tapped">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5700406/monotouch-dialog-which-element-was-tapped</A>

which has the following line of code which I'm not sure what it's 
doing other than adding a handler to Tapped:

  element.Tapped += () =&gt; {  Push (new SomeController (c.ClientId)); };



I also found this on stkovfl and have only a vague idea what it means.

I've looked also at DemoReflectionApi.cs in the MonoDevelop.Dialog 
demo, and see some similarities there with the immediately above 
topic.
