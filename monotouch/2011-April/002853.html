<PRE>Greetings,

I have a custom UIImageView and when it is constructed I would like to
create an (in memory or cached to the iDevice) Image that is a Filled
Rectangle of a specific size and color and then set it to the UIImageView's
Image property.

I know how to draw this on a UIImage's CGContext by overriding the Draw
method. However since I want to do this at the time the UIImageView is
constructed I don't actually have a context aI can draw on or anything since
it is not visible yet. I did try to do this in the draw method anyways but
it doesn't seem to work.

So if anyone can let me know if this is possible and if how to do this
programmatically at construction of the custom UIImageView when the app
starts before anything is displayed to the screen.

I am okay with answers in C# or Objective-C.

Best Regards!
