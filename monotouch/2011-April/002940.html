<PRE>Hi all,
Im trying out some basic functionality and I cant see what Im doing wrong.

Im looking for an example of a barebones MD solution that implements a
custom view controller that returns true in
ShouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation. Ive created an example,
ShouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation gets called several times on start
up, but didRotate is not called and the triangle I draw in my custom UIView
as a test stays in portrait mode, as does the top status bar.

Im sure Im doing something wrong at a simple level, but can anyone point me
at an example of how to get auto rotate to work? Ive searched high and low,
thats how I found I need a customer view controller. I even created a test
app with no UI so created my own static entrypoint and ui application
delegate, created my own UIWindow to ensure that my custom controller was
the top level.

Ideally I want to see in code how to do this, without needing to go through
IB. But any simple working example would be great.

Much appreciated.

Thanks
John
