<PRE>I think the thinking around the student version is: its for students
to do projects with. If they then want to put it into the appstore,
they are no longer &quot;learning&quot;, they are making money off it*, and
should really cough up for a license.

Given how flexible the novell guys are, if you bought the $99 one,
wrote an app (eg as part of your last-year of college or something)
and wanted to put it in the appstore, they would come to some
arrangement (most likely, you buy an upgrade for $299). you'd also
have to pay apple $99, BTW.

Just because it's not spelt out on the website doesn't mean it can't
be done. If you have a specific request, email Joseph Hill.

Also keep in mind that the Apple University program
(<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/university/">http://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/university/</A> ) does NOT allow
you to put your app in the store - or even do AdHoc stuff (it only
allows devices which are in within your &quot;developer team&quot; to be used).
So the Novell one is very much inline with what Apple has set up.

* if they decide to give the app away free, thats their decision. it's
still a commercial agreement with apple - and novell.

I suspect I also need to add: I don't work for Novell. I just use and
like MonoTouch a LOT. It's saved me many many many times the cost.....
