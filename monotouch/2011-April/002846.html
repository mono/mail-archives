<PRE>Hi all

Here is the code I have so far which will display the first page of a 
pdf and permit the user to zoom in and scroll around it.
<A HREF="http://monobin.com/__f415a9a4a">http://monobin.com/__f415a9a4a</A>

I am trying to familiarise myself with the various techniques/approaches 
of developing apps for a touch sensitive app (I'm mainly a business app 
developer for Windows.)  Basically I am trying to make the equivalent of 
the photo browser on iPhone but for the pages of a PDF file.  What I 
need to understand next is how I would approach the following

1: How to let the user scroll the page left/right with their finger.
2: How to bring in the next page as they scroll.

Basically I'd like the scrollable area to appear to the user as if it 
were one long continuous image of pages of the PDF laid out horizontally.

This is my learning exercise to see if iPad + MonoTouch development is 
something I'll be happy to work with in the future, so any help would be 
appreciated very much!


Pete
