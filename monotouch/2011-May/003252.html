<PRE>Hey Wally,

I loved ur book it is beside me now and has been an awesome help for me
starting out here.

I am soo frustrated and have been wondering what to do.  I have yet to by a
license so can't yet run on the phone, not good, not good at all.

Will Attachmate do something, it seems quite unlikely.  Should I buy a
license just to get onto the phone, dunno, tempted.

Do I want to learn Objective C and Java as well as C# ... Not really.  I
have enuff to do and learn at work as it is and this is my free time.

Do I want to wait for Miguel, I guess this might be the logical option.  He
says he will be compatible so maybe I will start some other projects and
bring them up to a point where they are ready to be moved.

And one project I will just do in Obj C, shit, that will easily use the next
3-4 months ;-)

Sigh ...

Cheers,

Mike
