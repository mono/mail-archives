<PRE>Maybe something with relation to that or that can give some clue (I never
saw this error)?

&quot;Debugger is unable to connect with the device

When you start debugging a device configuration, you will see the debugger
show a dialog indicating that it is listening on a particular IP address.
This IP address is also built into the application as a default setting.
When you start the application in debug mode, it makes a connection to
MonoDevelop, the debugger host. If it is unable to connect, the device
will vibrate once.
There are several reasons the application may not be able to connect to
the debugger:
If the device and the debugger host are on different networks, a firewall
or private network may be preventing the application from connecting to
the debugger host.
MonoDevelop may picked the wrong host IP address. MonoDevelop picks the
first IP address on the machine, which, if you have multiple network
interfaces, may not be the one you want. You can override the IP that
MonoDevelop uses by quitting MonoDevelop and editing its settings file.
This is in a hidden directory in in your home directory,
~/.config/MonoDevelop/MonoDevelopProperties.xml.
Look for the key &quot;MonoTouch.Debugger.HostIP&quot;, and edit the value. If it is
not present you will need to add it:
view plain &lt;<A HREF="http://monotouch.net/Documentation/Troubleshoot#">http://monotouch.net/Documentation/Troubleshoot#</A>&gt;print
&lt;<A HREF="http://monotouch.net/Documentation/Troubleshoot#">http://monotouch.net/Documentation/Troubleshoot#</A>&gt;?
&lt;<A HREF="http://monotouch.net/Documentation/Troubleshoot#">http://monotouch.net/Documentation/Troubleshoot#</A>&gt;


1. &lt;Property key=&quot;MonoTouch.Debugger.HostIP&quot; value=&quot;w.x.y.z&quot;/&gt;


where w.x.y.z is the IP you wish to use.
The debugger host's IP address may have changed. MonoDevelop has to embed
the host's IP address in the application's default settings so that it
knows what address to connect to. If the host's IP changes after you build
the app, you need to rebuild and re-upload the app, or change the IP
address entry in the app's settings on the device.&quot;

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I just wondered how I might avoid this very frequent message which only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disappears after I restart the Mac. Am I missing something fundamental?
