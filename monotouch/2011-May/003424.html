<PRE>Hi James,

I would definitely wait for @migueldeicaza's blog post tomorrow which
promises to shed some more light on the ex-mono teams new venture which
should make your decision a lot clearer.

So stay tuned for a new post coming to this blog tomorrow:
<A HREF="http://tirania.org/blog/">http://tirania.org/blog/</A>

Basically MonoTouch is a very good product which allows you to re-use you
knowledge and investment in C# to build iPhone and iPad apps.
Although you will likely still need to be able to read Objective-C as
Apple's documentation and examples are all in Objective-C.

Unfortunately as part of the Novell acquisition Attachmate has laid off the
entire Mono team.
As a result of this, most of the members of the Mono team have started a new
venture called Xamarin. Unfortunately since core parts of MonoTouch was a
proprietary product, Attachmate still owns the IP rights for it.

The problem is Attachmate aren't able to support the existing product, and
rather than waiting to negotiate an IP deal to obtain MonoTouch IP Rights
(which is effectively useless to Attachmate) Xamarin were going to spend the
next few months creating a new product that is source compatible with
MonoTouch.

That is the situation as it currently stands now, however we're all hoping
that Miguel's announcement will shed some new light on this situation (i.e.
hopefully they can obtain the IP rights and not have to rewrite core parts
of MonoTouch from scratch).

So my recommendation is not to buy MonoTouch from Novell/Attachmate just yet
and just wait for the blog post tomorrow.

Cheers,
