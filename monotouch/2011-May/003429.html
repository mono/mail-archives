<PRE>I have been building an app with Monotouch and trying to get it to 
work with an objc static library for device builds. The static 
library appeared to work fine in the simulator, but not in device 
builds, where the app crashes before the debugger sees any action at 
all. I noticed that even when I wasn't using the library the app 
behaved erratically, and I was seeing the debugger not stopping the 
app at set breakpoints. I chopped out a few .cs files, rebuilt, and 
the app started to behave better: I pulled more code out to get the 
objc library work as it does under the simulator. Sometimes (not all 
the time) the debugger would stop the app at breakpoints.

So here's part of what I'm seeing from the Console for the iPad. Does 
anyone know what it's on about? They show up during device build 
runtime.
