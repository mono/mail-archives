<PRE>Thanks for the replies Karl and Nic.
Yes this message appears to come after a previous debug session on the IPad
goes wrong and for some reason I get bowled out of the debug session.
Sometimes I get the phrase 'Connection has been lost' when it surprisingly
stops the debugging session. When I restart the debugging process again in
Monotouch it sometimes comes up with the Debugger is unable to connect with
the device message. From then on, it is impossible to proceed until I
restart the Mac.

Hope this helps further.

GP
