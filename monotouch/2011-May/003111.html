<PRE>Hi,

I'm relatively new to MonoTouch and am in the process of learning how to
build applications with it. I have been through many tutorials and have
moved onto implementing my own application with it's own custom user
interface.

I have successfully created a UIViewController based view and have added it
as a subview to the main window within the AppDelegate's &quot;FinishedLaunching&quot;
method. I have even been able to include images  in the project and load
them into a UIImageView with UIImage.FromFile. Incidentally it looks like
the newest MonoTouch release broke the ability to load jpgs. Until this
release I had no problem loading them. I had to switch to loading a png
rather than a jpg in order to display my image, with the latest release.

But that's not the real problem. Where I am have a major issue is when it
comes to responding to user input either through .Net events or iOS actions.
All outlets and actions that I have defined, on the File Owner, show up
correctly and I am able to setup my interface without issues. However when I
try to trigger either an event or the defined action I get an &quot;unrecognized
selector sent to instance&quot; exception. I initialize everything in the
&quot;ViewDidLoad&quot; method of the UIViewController in question. 

I try moving the button to the main window and do not add the previously
described UIViewController. I setup all the same events and actions (I
implement either or, not both) and the user interaction is captured and
processed without any problems every time.

I end up finding another example which responds to events in a subview and
see that the developer created an additional custom view controller in his
UIViewController, where he implements his outlets and actions. That
application has no problems capturing and processing user interactions.

So I set out to do the same for my application and get a little further
before blowing up. I am able to capture and process a few user interaction
events before I get the same exception &quot;unrecognized selector sent to
instance&quot;. A little bit of googling turns up that I am probably losing my
reference and something is being collected.

What is the write way to create subview and wire up events and/or actions?
Am I missing a step?

Thank you in advance for your help!
