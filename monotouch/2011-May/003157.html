<PRE>there is a company (Novell), a customer(me), a paid commercial product(MT).
customer need a support to be able to use the product. support is on
holiday. it is none of business why they do not response, i am not their
collique nor a partner of them. this is so amateur behaviour. i do not
consider this as personally. so i dont mean miguel.  i mean novell. support
department belongs novell. if there is no response from support that means
novell is bad company. it is so dangerous to make business with them.

there is no other options except wait. i think miguel will make an personal
announcement. if they leave novell as a team to support MT, for me it will
not be acceptable. they do not support as a company, so they can not support
as a small team. as i know novell is very old company. you trust old
companies.

what i need is so simple; support should apply license transfer process as
they mentioned. it seems they stopped all support process which effects me
as a customer.

a product like this must have &quot;always&quot; feature not &quot;sometimes&quot;. as a hobby
sometimes is acceptable, as a business not.

assume that you have an account on a bank. you want to transfer money. you
can not do it for 6 days. you can not reach to the support. someone says you
to send blank paper to other account for a while, wait monday :-)
