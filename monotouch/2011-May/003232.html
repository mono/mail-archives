<PRE>
Miguel - Thanks for the blog entry, and I am happy that you are moving forward with a great software stack - but what does this mean for the people who are working with monotouch *NOW*. 

I have applications in the app store built using monotouch. Attachmate has been utterly silent , and I am seriously concerned about our ability to build and deploy moving forward....  Then there is the issue of the enterprise license (5 user) that we just purchased.....  Did we just toss the $$$ down the drain? 

What is the timeframe for your new company to ramp up and deliver a production quality stack?

I realize that you are no longer an employee of Novell/Attachmate - so if you cannot answer these questions, I understand.... but ANY guidance you can provide would be very, very helpful.
