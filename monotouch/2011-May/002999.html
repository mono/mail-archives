<PRE>ok, I think I'm ready to give up on IB. Is there somewhere on the web I
haven't found where I can get a good example of creating interfaces with mt
in code? I find some example doing it in xcode, but I'm new to this whole
new apple world (down to the frustrating keyboard behaviour :( ). I just
don't know enough about xcode or mt to look at an xcode example and convert
it to mt. I was doing fine till I wanted to have a 3 tab controller, where
tab 1 has a nav controller, tab 2 has a table view controller, and tab 3 has
another nav controller. I had the 1st 2 working fine. But as soon as I added
the nav controller to the 3rd tab, it died. If i left it a UIViewController,
it was ok. I then tried a new test project and got the same results. I was
extremely careful to make sure I created the 3rd tabe exactly like the 1st.
My root views were created identically. But as soon as I touch the 3rd tab,
it dies with unrecognized selector sent to 0xetc. I would think that IB
could handle this easily, but maybe I'm naive, or i'm just plain dumb.

Thanks for your help.
