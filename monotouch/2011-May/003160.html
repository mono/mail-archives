<PRE>Fair enough, I guess.

Try calling Novell (who, btw, don't legally exist anymore - old
company or not) if you can't wait:

<A HREF="http://www.novell.com/ContactsOffices/contacts_offices.jsp">http://www.novell.com/ContactsOffices/contacts_offices.jsp</A>

or Attachmate, who bought them:

<A HREF="http://www.attachmate.com/Worldwide/Attachmate+Worldwide.htm">http://www.attachmate.com/Worldwide/Attachmate+Worldwide.htm</A>

They might be able to do something. If I was you, I'd be using Skype,
'cos a normal voice call, if it's international, is going to cost you
a LOT (expect to be on hold for a while)

try asking on irc (here: <A HREF="http://monotouch.net/Chat">http://monotouch.net/Chat</A> ) - I'd ask for
you, but I'm at work, and IRC is blocked.

Other than that, there isn't much anyone here can do for you today....

Sorry
