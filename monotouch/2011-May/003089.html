It's not exactly difficult to run a disassembler on ARM/x86/whatever machine code to get assembly code, then investigate the assembly to see how it works.

That doesn't sound like disagreement. That sounds like agreement and acceptance.

You _cannot_ protect your code 100%, and additional protections have additional costs as well:

Exactly. Thus, you've determined that 100% security is a bad investment, and have opted to instead accept some &quot;theft&quot; in an effort to avoid the costs of the copy protection. This is sane, and I can't argue.
