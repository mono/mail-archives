Dear gosh, I can't type.  let me restate

The problem is that there have been so little facts available in this.  Everyone knew something was happening.  Unfortunately, you can't report on what you see in the crystal ball.  We had all pretty much speculated that something was happening, but we ALL didn't think it was this bad.  I expect to start seeing press coverage starting tonight/tomorrow.

Subject: [mono-android] MT / MD debacle - where is the press coverage?

I've seen very little coverage of this situation in the tech press, over than the initial items about the layoffs (which turned out to be dead-on).
Does anyone have ideas about how to get some coverage of this, to both a) hopefully shame/prod Attachmate into clarifying what the hell they're going to do for those of us with paid licenses, and b) give Miguel and company some good press to start their new venture off with.



Fun facts about the CEO of Attachmate: <A HREF="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_11572535">http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_11572535</A>
