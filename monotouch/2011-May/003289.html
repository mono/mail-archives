logos from each copy.

execution of the Software and each additional copy (or partial copy) of

GENERAL TERMS

Term. This Agreement becomes effective on the date You legally acquire 
the Software and will automatically terminate if You breach any of its 
terms.
Benchmark Testing. This benchmark testing restriction applies to You if 
You are a software developer or licensor or if You are performing 
testing on the Software at the direction of or on behalf of a software 
developer or licensor. You may not, without Novell's prior written 
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, publish or disclose to any 
third party the results of any benchmark test of the Software. If You 
are a licensor of products that are functionally similar to or compete 
with the Software (&#8220;Similar Products&#8221;), or are acting on behalf of such 
a licensor, and You publish or disclose benchmark information on the 
Software in violation of this restriction, then notwithstanding anything 
to the contrary in the Similar Product's end user license agreement, and 
in addition to any other remedies Novell may have, Novell shall have the 
right to perform benchmark testing on Similar Products and to disclose 
and publish that benchmark information and You hereby represent that You 
have authority to grant such right to Novell.
Open Source. Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict, limit or 
otherwise affect any rights or obligations You may have, or conditions 
to which You may be subject, under any applicable open source licenses

only be brought before the courts of competent jurisdiction of the State 
of Utah. If, however, Your country of principal residence is a member

Agreement is governed by the laws of that country, and any action at law 
may only be brought before a court of competent jurisdiction of that 
country.

agreement between You and Novell and may be amended or modified only by 
a written agreement agreed to by You and an authorized representative of 
Novell. NO LICENSOR, DISTRIBUTOR, DEALER, RETAILER, RESELLER, SALES 
PERSON, OR EMPLOYEE IS AUTHORIZED TO MODIFY THIS AGREEMENT OR TO MAKE 
ANY REPRESENTATION OR PROMISE THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM, OR IN ADDITION TO, 
THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.
Waiver. No waiver of any right under this Agreement will be effective 
unless in writing, signed by a duly authorized representative of the 
party to be bound. No waiver of any past or present right arising from 
any breach or failure to perform will be deemed to be a waiver of any 
future right arising under this Agreement.
Severability. If any provision in this Agreement is invalid or 
unenforceable, that provision will be construed, limited, modified or, 
if necessary, severed, to the extent necessary, to eliminate its 
invalidity or unenforceability, and the other provisions of this 
Agreement will remain unaffected.

this Agreement may be subject to U.S. export controls and the trade laws 
of other countries. The parties agree to comply with all export control 
regulations and to obtain any required licenses or classification to
