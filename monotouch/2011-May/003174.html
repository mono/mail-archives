<PRE>Thanks for taking the time to help out.

We have looked at the parameters sent to the validation call and they all
look ok/correct.


After some testing, we noticed that the request is being sent without the
request header.  A colleague of mine ran sun tracing tools and other stuff
on the WCF server while running the windows phone 7 and the iphone versions
of the app to check.  The iphone one appears to be missing the request
header.

We then made a test app on visual studio (just a console app - using the
connection code we use on the iphone/windows phone 7 app) on windows and
connect to the https service with fiddler running, we managed to find out
the request header and then copy the request header picked up by fiddler and
hard code (temporarily) it into the iphone app to include in a soap request,
then we can connect to the https WCF using the iphone app.

Of course this meant that the few lines of connection code from the WP7 app
has now ballooned into several dozen lines of code after we made changes to
generate the header dynamically (i.e. no longer hardcoded) as well as
implemented asynchronous calls.


If anyone has found a simpler way, please let me know.  

And here's to hoping WCF support is expanded in later releases of monotouch 
:<i>)
