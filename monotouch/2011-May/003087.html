<PRE>&gt;<i> While true, this is not necessarily a complete answer. It's not exactly difficult to run a disassembler on ARM/x86/whatever machine code to get assembly code, then investigate the assembly to see how it works. This is fairly common to do [0], with a multitude of high-end ($$$) debuggers designed to simplify this process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In short, native code is not 100% secure either, it's just another form of obfuscation, and can't be expected to stop those who want to spend time/resources to figure out how your app works.
</I>&gt;<i>

In my opinion, and I suspect a lot of people would disagree: if
someone is going to go to this length, then they are welcome to it.
It's more effort to protect from this than it's worth.

If someone is disasm'ing c# code which has been AOT'ed into ARM, and
can read the ARM code and work out whats really going on - well, thats
a level of protection I'm unwilling to invest in.

Last time I used obfuscation (xenocode) it stopped people stealing the
app (at an app level), but it cost us maybe 10-50x the cost of &quot;theft&quot;
which happened before, in added support costs. Maybe we weren't doing
it right, but still: it was a big hassle for very very little return.
