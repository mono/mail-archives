<PRE>It may be that you can ACTIVATE twice. The activation server clearly keeps
track of the computers that have activated. I'm not convinced, however, that
the actual license file is tied to the computer. When I first purchased
MonoTouch 3.2.4 back in March I couldn't activate it due to our
firewall/proxy server. MonoTouch tech support sent me a license file that I
had to drop into ~/Library/MonoTouch. You could try copying that License
file to your new machine and see if it works.

The license does appear to be version specific, since upgrading to 4.0.3
required a reactivation. So if this is going to work, make sure you install
the same version on the new machine as you have on the current.

Interestingly, the activation server now shows my account as having
activated 2 computers. I'm assuming one is mine from when I finally moved
outside my firewall to activate 4.0.3 last week and the other is the
computer that tech support used to generate my license file.

Good luck!
