<PRE>Well&#138;.. I found the problem&#138;..

Inspired on Miguel's tip to do an UIAlert/MessageBox that waits for user
button press, I becae greedy and implemented a &quot;modal&quot; view controller, like
a modal Form in Windows, where you can open a dialog, the user work and when
finish, the parent form receive the response of the child form because it's
modal and continues the execution, so parent form stop the code execution
until child close&#138;

So when I open a view controller like:

// myView is declared &quot;globally&quot; inside the class
myView = new MyView();
myView.ModalTransitionStyle = UIModalTransitionStyle.FlipHorizontal;
myView.ModalPresentationStyle = UIModalPresentationStyle.FullScreen;
this.PresentModalViewController (myView, true);

After I have the inspired code&#138;:

while (!childView.isClosed)
{
NSRunLoop.Current.RunUntil (NSDate.FromTimeIntervalSinceNow (0.5));
}

So&#138; My modal-mutant-child view runs and parent stay stopped until child
closes. But then, all animation of bounces in web views, map views, image
views&#138; All animation became crepy, like heavy and bad animated&#138;. Shame
myself ^^&#138; don't be greedy with the dark force.

Now I have to look for a way or the correct way to when a child view
dismiss, then must execute things like update info on parent, etc&#138; All
different than windows, my sin.

If I continue with this path soon I'll able to write a book about 100 things
to do NOT do with MonoTouch hehe.&#138; Or maybe a MonoTouch uncyclopedia&#138;

A complement&#138;:

The below code in a main window on the original iphone simulator project
that this is loaded as all tutorial samples of the world it's running
smoothly. So if I didn't done nothing wrong, and someone will test because
none perceived some possible bug, test this inside a second view controller,
not in the main window.

I called this view controller (and maybe all views inside the application)
in that way:

// myView is declared &quot;globally&quot; inside the class
myView = new MyView();
myView.ModalTransitionStyle = UIModalTransitionStyle.FlipHorizontal;
myView.ModalPresentationStyle = UIModalPresentationStyle.FullScreen;
this.PresentModalViewController (myView, true);

Thanks,

Karl

Subject:  SPAM-LOW:  [MonoTouch] UIScrollView not moving correctly and not
bouncing anymore

Hi

I had a simple UIScrollView showing some JPGs as part of a enterprise
application. So in the last days I published some new versions correcting
and enhancing another modules/pieces of the application. My boss called a
few hours speaking about the image viewer not running well anymore in his
iPad, but I didn't changed nothing. I test this on iPad and simulator. So
after several tests I came back to book sample inside the iPad application
and copied the below code to the project, replacing real code. The
difference of the book is that is inside a override ViewDidLoad() and there
is and &quot;special&quot; thing to be fullscreen:

// Is't full screen
UIApplication.SharedApplication.StatusBarHidden = true;

RectangleF scrollFrame = scrollView.Frame;
scrollFrame.Width = scrollFrame.Width * 3;
scrollView.ContentSize = scrollFrame.Size;
scrollView.ShowsHorizontalScrollIndicator = false;
RectangleF frame = scrollView.Frame;
frame.X = 0;
UITextView textView = new UITextView (frame);
textView.Editable = false;
textView.Text = &quot;This is page one&quot;;
scrollView.AddSubview (textView);
frame.X = frame.Width + 1;
textView = new UITextView (frame);
textView.Editable = false;
textView.Text = &quot;This is page two&quot;;
scrollView.AddSubview (textView);
frame.X = frame.Width * 2 + 1;
textView = new UITextView (frame);
textView.Editable = false;
textView.Text = &quot;This is page three&quot;;
scrollView.AddSubview (textView);
scrollView.Scrolled += delegate(object sender, EventArgs e) {
Console.WriteLine (&quot;scrolled &quot;); };


There is a see images just on landscape, like keynote:
public override bool ShouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation
(UIInterfaceOrientation toInterfaceOrientation)
{
if (toInterfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientation.Portrait ||
toInterfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientation.PortraitUpsideDown)
return false;
else
return true;
}

So I found that the same problem is running. If you drag the page with
finger from the page 0 to left, black background appear but when you stop to
touch screen, the page 0 do not returns to it's place. If you try to finger
ir to the right to move in a smooth animation to the page 1, the page 0
moves a little until the finger stop to touch the screen and do not move to
page 1. Also the movement of the page 0 is streange, lige it has clue
behind&#138; Or it's heavy&#138;..

Is the some change in newest Mono or some new bug? Is the only thing I think
was changes since the last versions through a week or something like.

The problem: at 3 am of today brazillian time, our client travelled to
another country to show the solution to their superiors to try an approval
of our solution/company&#138; And I can't move back the the latest version of the
application published because their travelled with a new iPad so I made the
new profile for adhoc some hours ago&#138;.
