<PRE>Hi

I had a simple UIScrollView showing some JPGs as part of a enterprise
application. So in the last days I published some new versions correcting
and enhancing another modules/pieces of the application. My boss called a
few hours speaking about the image viewer not running well anymore in his
iPad, but I didn't changed nothing. I test this on iPad and simulator. So
after several tests I came back to book sample inside the iPad application
and copied the below code to the project, replacing real code. The
difference of the book is that is inside a override ViewDidLoad() and there
is and &quot;special&quot; thing to be fullscreen:

// Is't full screen
UIApplication.SharedApplication.StatusBarHidden = true;

RectangleF scrollFrame = scrollView.Frame;
scrollFrame.Width = scrollFrame.Width * 3;
scrollView.ContentSize = scrollFrame.Size;
scrollView.ShowsHorizontalScrollIndicator = false;
RectangleF frame = scrollView.Frame;
frame.X = 0;
UITextView textView = new UITextView (frame);
textView.Editable = false;
textView.Text = &quot;This is page one&quot;;
scrollView.AddSubview (textView);
frame.X = frame.Width + 1;
textView = new UITextView (frame);
textView.Editable = false;
textView.Text = &quot;This is page two&quot;;
scrollView.AddSubview (textView);
frame.X = frame.Width * 2 + 1;
textView = new UITextView (frame);
textView.Editable = false;
textView.Text = &quot;This is page three&quot;;
scrollView.AddSubview (textView);
scrollView.Scrolled += delegate(object sender, EventArgs e) {
Console.WriteLine (&quot;scrolled &quot;); };


There is a see images just on landscape, like keynote:
public override bool ShouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation
(UIInterfaceOrientation toInterfaceOrientation)
{
if (toInterfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientation.Portrait ||
toInterfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientation.PortraitUpsideDown)
return false;
else
return true;
}

So I found that the same problem is running. If you drag the page with
finger from the page 0 to left, black background appear but when you stop to
touch screen, the page 0 do not returns to it's place. If you try to finger
ir to the right to move in a smooth animation to the page 1, the page 0
moves a little until the finger stop to touch the screen and do not move to
page 1. Also the movement of the page 0 is streange, lige it has clue
behind&#138; Or it's heavy&#138;..

Is the some change in newest Mono or some new bug? Is the only thing I think
was changes since the last versions through a week or something like.

The problem: at 3 am of today brazillian time, our client travelled to
another country to show the solution to their superiors to try an approval
of our solution/company&#138; And I can't move back the the latest version of the
application published because their travelled with a new iPad so I made the
new profile for adhoc some hours ago&#138;.
