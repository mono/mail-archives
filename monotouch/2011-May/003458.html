<PRE>Hello, I keep getting mails that my message is not posted yet that's why I
try again here.
Sorry for any potential double post.

Pending Alert: This post has NOT been accepted by the mailing list yet.


Hi Guys,

The idea is to play an entry movie once and then a second one in an endless
loop in order to simulate an existing flash movie on an iPAD.
I was able to play the second one by just adding the movieplayer view to my
actual view
and then change the Content URL.
 
                                moviePlayerStart.View.Frame =
myiv9.TestMovieView.Frame;
                               
myiv9.View.AddSubview(moviePlayerStart.View);
                                moviePlayerStart.RepeatMode =
MPMovieRepeatMode.One;
                                var videoUrl = NSUrl.FromFilename 
(&quot;moviez/Teil2.mov&quot;);
                                moviePlayerStart.ContentUrl = videoUrl;

I've played with the MPMoviePlayerPlaybackDidFinishNotification events and
wanted to play the first movie and then if the event is fired start the
second but I can't seem to preload both movies and always no seamless
effect... Any good ideas how to solve this problem?


Seconed question: Currently I was implementing a single movie which works
good.
However when the movie is first loaded it shows a white (or whatever)
background.
I would like to show a png instead. How could I do that?

Third question: I am having multiple views showing the same  movieplayer and
i just change the movie view and the videoUrl when changing the Views. Is
this good practise?



Any help is greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Stonee
