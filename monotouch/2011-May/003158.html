<PRE>Guys,

I think no need to panic. Miguel will say nice things on Monday (I believe). Mono was open source, founded and paid generously by Novell and supported, Attachmate might have some plans with other Novell products, but still they want to make money, if they say Mono and Monotouch etc is no longer needed at their gates, well it will be sold to somebody. For example am now on such a huuuuuuuge project that uses Monotouch that I can imagine that even this company will buy the code and start supporting that (and believe me, the client has some power, and put huge investment in the Monotouch team here).

In the &quot;worst&quot; scenario there is I think it will be made public and open sourced altogether.

But my opinion is, that this is such a great opportunity now, that the real power of MT can be only unleashed under new order, whatever it will be. Who knows, even the big M might have a wink at that to acquire it (proper Visual Studio on Mac then, how about that? Well one can still dream :-))

So lets stay calm, wait for Monday and then we will know. Until then, I'm back at the excellent Monotouch to write some nice productive code.

Cheers,
@sichy
