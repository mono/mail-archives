<PRE>why do you need to obfuscate it?

Whats on the device is object code - ARM assembly - so unless someone
looks into it and finds the API keys.... you should be safe. It's the
same as a true windows .exe (not a .NET one) - it's processor code.

If you want to avoid this, maybe put the strings in the app encoded,
and decode them when the app is running. Even something as base64
encoding them or just reversing the string would be enough to prevent
somone using &quot;strings&quot; to get it out. If someone is somehow debugging
your running app on the device, there isn't a good way to stop them
getting it.

Being you have to use these on the device, I don't see a good way to
have them 100% &quot;secure&quot;., unless you encrypted them with a key, and
then downloaded that key off your server before use (which would suck
if your user was underground, eg the london tube). But even then, the
unencrypted string is still in memory, so if someone has gone to this
length, they would be able to get it anyway.

So, the chances of going from arm code back to usable c# code is
minimal. The .dll / .exe's in the .app bundle don't have code in them,
as far as I know, they just have debug info. Aside from knowing that
your class is called &quot;foo&quot; and it has a method &quot;bar&quot;, there isn't
anything in there.

Obfuscation is seldom a real answer, if you actually have the problem.
Most people think they have the problem.... even if they don't.

assuming it's a private API, have you also thought about someone
running a packet sniffer? If it's not over HTTPS, they'll get the key
easily. If it IS over HTTPS, it's not too hard to do a
man-in-the-middle attack using something like Charles, being you have
control over the proxy on the client and could accept the &quot;new&quot;
certificate to make it valid on the device.
