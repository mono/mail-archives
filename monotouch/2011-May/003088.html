<PRE>Hello,
I'd like to create my dialogs using Interface Builder, but splitting them in
small components in order to better manage or possibly reuse them.

In Apple documentation is advised that a dialog contains only a view
controller derived from UIViewController, using it as root, while the other
components that constitute the dialog, if I understand correctly, should be
simply views, not view controllers: this is due in order to avoid problems
in some situations handled by a view controller, eg. when the form is
rotated / resized.

Then only way I found to build this reusable user controls is following this
steps:
- add an iPhone View to the project (e.g. MyCustomView)
- edit it in Interface Builder
- then add at least an outlet inside it (in this way MonoDevelop create the
class definition in MyCustomView.xib.designer.cs)
- in MyCustomView.xib.cs i defined the other part of the partial class
MyCustomView, inheriting from UIView and adding a constructor with the
IntPtr parameter

Then, in order to load this reusable view inside the dialog that need it (in
this sample could be MainWindow), I added a UIView to MainWindow, and
associated an outlet to it (calling it Placeholder).
- Then in MainWindow code (that is, in this case in the main code), I
created an istance of MyCustomView using
NSBundle.MainBundle.LoadNib(&quot;MyCustomView&quot;, ...) and getting the view
instance from the array returned
- finally, I gave to the MyCustomView instance the size of the Placeholder
view, and add it to Placeholder as sub-biew (via Placeholder.AddSubview)

Is this correct, or are there better ways to accomplish this (always using
IB... I know of the other approaches based only on code)?
