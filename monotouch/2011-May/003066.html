<PRE>Thanks Nick and Nok, I wasn't aware about Charles, makes SSL moot in this
situation and similar.  I like the suggestions, makes sense.  Coming from a
.net world where without obfuscation one can simply look at the dll and
decipher how that &quot;shared secret&quot; is built and easily write something to
build their own to spoof the server into false positives.  The game will be
for WP7, iPhone and Android (I have 3 WP7 games in the marketplace so
far)....it seems the solution for this on iOS will have to be completely
different than WP7 as obfuscation will help with making the creation of the
shared key difficult to determine and that fact that I have ARM like you
mentioned to help me some on iOS.  

To make things even more difficult I also need to find a way to make sure
that only one &quot;game account&quot; exists and can log in from the device, I don't
want real people playing with more than one account at a time (think Eve
Online...your subscription enables you to have only one account with one
active player training his/hers skills at a time).  WP7 has a device ID and
Anon ID (jailbroken WP7 devices don't have an Anon ID, so using both of
these together helps).  Not sure how to go about this on iOS, especially in
the context of someone registering a device, playing my game, selling the
device, and the new person on that same device wanting to play as well.

All of this seems way overly complex than it needs to be, I wonder how
Pocket Legends handles all this.  Thats for iPhone and Android.
