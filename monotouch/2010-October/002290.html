I&#8217;m trying to use MonoTouch.CoreAnimation.CAAnimation.CurrentMediaTime() to retrieve the number of ticks since the system started, but receiving the error

Unhandled Exception: System.EntryPointNotFoundException: CurrentMediaTime
  at (wrapper managed-to-native) MonoTouch.CoreAnimation.CAAnimation:CurrentMediaTime ()


Is this supported in MonoTouch, if so, any ideas as to what I&#8217;m missing, or is this a bug?

Many thanks in advance,

Mike
