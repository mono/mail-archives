Oops - sorry guys, wrong list...

On 04/10/2010 22:46, &quot;Mike Warriner&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monotouch">mike at ie.com</A>&gt; wrote:

I think there is a bug in the UTF7 encoding - the following code gives a different byte output on a Windows machine (.net 4, Win7, x64) compared to on the simulator.

(Character 11 is different)

Any thoughts on whether this is a bug, or by design?

Thanks,

Mike

            string xyzzy = &quot;Hash=\&quot;+Cgwxu&quot;;
            byte[] b = Encoding.UTF7.GetBytes(xyzzy);
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; b.Length; i++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;I = &quot; + i + &quot; = &quot; + b[i]+&quot; '&quot;+(char)b[i]+&quot;'&quot;);
            }
