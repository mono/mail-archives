<PRE>Bryan,

Just for future reference, I'm told by our testers that this doesn't actually work - apparently Environment.TickCount changes if the clock changes on Monotouch, but not on Windows.

We've gone the route of using the Core Animation API directly - it would be great to get both TickCount and CurrentMediaTime fixed at some point in the future if possible please,

Thanks,

Mike

I'm trying to use MonoTouch.CoreAnimation.CAAnimation.CurrentMediaTime() to retrieve the number of ticks since the system started, but receiving the error

Unhandled Exception: System.EntryPointNotFoundException: CurrentMediaTime
  at (wrapper managed-to-native) MonoTouch.CoreAnimation.CAAnimation:CurrentMediaTime ()


Is this supported in MonoTouch, if so, any ideas as to what I'm missing, or is this a bug?

Many thanks in advance,

Mike
