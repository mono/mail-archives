<PRE>Craig,

I think community is what can drive the MonoTouch success to an extent. If there is a good amount of content in the sense of:

*         Apps powered by MonoTouch showcase

*         Blogs/Screencasts on building MonoTouch apps

*         Blogs/Screencasts showing how easy MonoTouch apps are to build than its ObjC counter part (similar to the flash vs Silverlight site that is very popular these days, I forget the name of it, shinedraw I think?)

*         General MonoTouch news

I think of this similar to the Microsoft MVP and related programs. It encourages people to get involved in the community. Once people see that many shops are developing rich iPhone apps that look &quot;normal&quot; and benefit from code re-use, better developer environment etc, it starts to attract a much larger awareness and audience. Things like this can multiply your sales.

If there's one thing I've learned over the years, it's the &quot;build it and they will come&quot; dream doesn't work. Awareness/marketing is the biggest factor whether a rock solid product will succeed or fail to meet expectations.

I think almost all of us here have no doubts regarding the impact MonoTouch has, but awareness is going to be the biggest challenge. It is one reason why I created my blog (which I need to start updating more often) because I really believe MonoTouch hits the sweet spot on many levels and I want as much people to know about it as possible.

Thanks and take care,
Simon

Subject: Re: [MonoTouch] Commercial pricing ?

There hasn't been much discussion about what the different target markets might be for MonoTouch -- John's comment crystalized it for me &quot;they'll simply go the Objective-C route)&quot;.

I think MonoTouch has the potential to open up iPhone development to a new set of programmers who actually can't/won't ever learn Objective-C... the Microsoft-masses. Every corporate developer churning out ASP.NET&lt;<A HREF="http://ASP.NET">http://ASP.NET</A>&gt; stuff with web services suddenly has a much lower barrier to entry (just learn IB/NIB)... even that disappear altogether if &quot;MoonTouch&quot; eventuates (and runs on Android) :)

These developers are probably more used to buying tools (point already made previously), but also their employer might be the purchaser. I can see a lot of potential Enterprise apps (BI, monitoring as well as marketing/customer-related) being facilitated by MonoTouch - the biz code and webservices already exist in .NET.

So in addition to this discussion about Free/Indie/Pro there is another pricepoint that will be important for Novell - Enterprise. Heck even Apple charges $99 for one dev and $300(?) for 'Enterprise' signing. If $1000 for a Pro licence is OK - what's an Enterprise licence worth? The military have already produced iPod Touch apps - what a contract that would be for Novell if the app development speed was doubled by MonoTouch over ObjC.

MonoTouch is a cool platform - and clearly a nice change from ObjC even for those who know it well. But if Novell can get the pricing right (and the samples/training/ecosystem going) I wonder if that market isn't going to be quite small compared to the potential influx of experienced C# developers (solo &amp; corporate) who want to jump on the iPhone bandwagon (*definitely* an attractive bandwagon to jump on). If this 'big pent-up demand' does actually exist, that's probably good for everyone (their cash pays Novell to keep the price down and the whole thing running)... if only the people on this mailing list ever end up licencing the tool -- that's not so good :-(

Whether this pans out or not... who knows. Whether this 'imagined' group contributes lots to the AppStore or more to private apps... who knows. But Novell has a very difficult decision to make (and a whole pile of marketing work to do), that's for sure.

p.s. just my 2c

Hi,

Wow, quite the buzz around pricing.

As I mentioned before on another thread ideally a free (simulator only) version will be enabled at some point in order to stimulate a community around it (documentation and samples etc is something we can never have enough of :) ). As someone pointed out, the higher the price the less people will take it up (especially indie developers as they'll simply go the Objective-C route). Since a free version can't be offered right now I hope it does so soon after.

The rapid change during the beta has been great but people are still identify issues and there are others still waiting in the wings to trial the beta. Once it is priced and released expectations will be set and others will base their decision based on what they hear from those who purchased it soon after the release. If some people are pushing for a release could they have something similar to Microsoft's Go Live license?

That way you could utilise the rest of the month to get more beta versions out, invite the remaining people waiting to test it out (this will bring in a fresh set of eyes to investigate the beta) and get the education/free simulator version ready. This would give you the opportunity to take advantage of the buzz around the release to get as many people as possible to install MonoTouch and give it a try.

An affordable indie price would be good too :) (since you already have to buy a MacBook and pay Apple $99 if you are a typical .net developer).

Cheers,

John

</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nothing to do with price, but i think the monotouch
</I>&gt;<i> progress has been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; phenomenal but really its seems to be at early/mid
</I>&gt;<i> beta level, not RTM
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; quality.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although I agree, we are struggling on two sides: on one
</I>&gt;<i> side, producing
</I>&gt;<i> the most polished release of MonoTouch that we can, and on
</I>&gt;<i> the other the
</I>&gt;<i> request that people want a license that they can start
</I>&gt;<i> shipping apps
</I>&gt;<i> with today.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that our plan to sell MonoTouch with one year of
</I>&gt;<i> upgrades will
</I>&gt;<i> minimize the problems of having software that feels
</I>&gt;<i> beta-ish to folks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Miguel.
