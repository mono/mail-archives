<PRE>To each and every one of you both on the front lines and behind the scenes
who brought about such a fine example of what a first release both can and
should be like, congratulations on a job well done!
No doubt you're all watching the activity on Twitter, though in case you
haven't had a chance,
<A HREF="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23MonoTouch%20OR%20MonoTouch%20OR%20mtouch%20OR%20%23mtouch%20OR%20http%3A%2F%2Fmonotouch.netshould">http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23MonoTouch%20OR%20MonoTouch%20OR%20mtouch%20OR%20%23mtouch%20OR%20http%3A%2F%2Fmonotouch.netshould</A>
catch just about every possible comment.

Also, to whomever was in charge of the design, development, and deployment
of <A HREF="http://monotouch.net/">http://monotouch.net/</A> &lt; I really don't mean to make any attempt
whatsoever to poach. My assumption is that you're both pleasantly and
gainfully employed, and it's not likely I'd be able to pay any more than
what you're already making. As such, just ignore this UNLESS by some off
chance you just so happen to be looking for more work. If this /is/ the
case, PLEASE CONTACT ME! You've done an /AMAZING/ job and would love the
chance to see what you might be able to do with a documentation and API
project I've been in need of getting completed for quite some time now.

Oh, one last thing: A few days ago I started up a Q/A session with Miguel
with the intention of timing it's release on oreilly.com with todays
official release of MonoTouch, Of course, our last discussion made it seem
like it might be possible if Monday came and went without a release, and as
a result, I'm not quite ready with the end result of that interview. That
said, I'll be blasting away at it during the better part of this morning in
hopes I can convince Miguel to find a few more minutes to answer a few final
questions.

But either way, as per <A HREF="http://twitter.com/mdavid/status/3978357020">http://twitter.com/mdavid/status/3978357020</A> whether
it be in the form of &quot;Part One of N&quot; or all in one go, come tomorrow morning
you'll find something related to this aforementioned subject matter at very
least here: <A HREF="http://broadcast.oreilly.com/m-david-peterson/">http://broadcast.oreilly.com/m-david-peterson/</A> and here:
<A HREF="http://oreilly.com/community/">http://oreilly.com/community/</A> and here: <A HREF="http://oreilly.com/blogs/">http://oreilly.com/blogs/</A> though
given the attention this release is bound to be receiving, there's a good
chance you'll find it on the front page of <A HREF="http://oreilly.com">http://oreilly.com</A> as well.
 Either way, I'll update this thread when it's live.


And just because I think you all deserve a whole hell of lot more thanks,
congratulations, and as much beer as you each can possible consume in a 8
hour period and then some,

NICE WORK, EVERYONE!!!!
