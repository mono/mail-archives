&gt;<i> Sandy, yes, I'm reading the same mailing list and&#160;followed quite a bit this

Well look in the archives, this was all discussed before the prices
were even officially announced (thread called &quot;Commercial pricing?&quot;),
and Miguel responded at that time (Sept 8th):

&quot;We might consider a Learning Edition, but right now it is a bit late to
do these changes as Monday is almost upon us, and that is our internal
agreed date for the final release (too many internal details have to be
sorted out for us to make that change).&quot;

&gt;<i> I understand that big corporations take time to work out pricing models and
</I>&gt;<i> that these prices were determined long before they were revealed to the Beta
</I>&gt;<i> Team. However, with that in mind, maybe Novell should have released the
</I>&gt;<i> prices to the Beta Team much earlier so that they could have take our
</I>&gt;<i> concerns to heart.
</I>
Perhaps.

&gt;<i> Giving the Beta Team the price list on Friday, seeing the flurry of concern
</I>&gt;<i> over the weekend and yet releasing on Monday with the same prices just
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't seem right.
</I>&gt;<i> If their was concern by the Mono/MonoTouch Team about the concern being
</I>&gt;<i> discussed here then maybe they should address it.... here or on the
</I>&gt;<i> MonoTouch web site.
</I>
Did you read Joseph's &quot;Pricing and Launch Update&quot; email?  The very
first paragraph said:

&quot;I would like to thank everyone for the feedback that you have provided,
and would like to let you know that we understand that you have some
very valid concerns.  We will be taking steps in the next weeks to address
many of these, some actions will take longer than others, but we definitely
want to do what we can today.&quot;

and later:

&quot;You've given us some
great suggestions regarding limited versions and trials, which we've
already been considering, and we will make a determination about the
best solution for hobby developers in the very near future.&quot;

I would think that encouraging words such as these from people who
have been very forthright in their communication with the beta testers
would help you to be a bit more patient.

I can't help but feel that some people are spending a lot more time
complaining (repeating things that have already been said) and not
much time reading.

Sandy
