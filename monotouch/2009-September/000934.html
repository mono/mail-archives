<PRE>Hi

I decided to drop this in because I think I represent the 'floating  
developer'.

I am a former Smalltalker who had to move languages, chose .NET over  
Java, achieved the MCPD Enterprise certification to ease the move. My  
daily work involves .NET 3.5 mostly in WCF and WPF within C#,  been in  
the .NET camp for about 3 years.

Still missing the dynamic side of life but thats another thread.

I do not think of myself as a language nerd, but I do enjoy gaining  
the mindset that other languages bring to the table, I have written  
industry apps in Prolog, C++, Smalltalk, C#. These were/are serious  
enterprise apps. Point being that I don't mind a language learning  
curve.

I am about to submit my first app (paid) to the app store, a small  
memory game, pure obj-c, a little IB for one screen. I needed to get  
my head around the 'embedded Smalltalk in C' bit, going back to  
organising header files etc felt retro, but I got on with it and when  
I knew enough not to have to stop to browse or pick up a book, I was  
enjoying it. I did miss Resharper, I did miss not being able to write  
little addins for VS2008, but nothing was a blocker.

I wrote it for my 3 year old daughter to play with and to get an  
inside look on the whole iPhone App thing.
I have a desire to produce a silverlight version (so my daughter  
doesn't always need my iphone).
I have no idea of my return for this app, return would be nice but not  
expected.

When I stumbled over the MonoTouch beta program I was so excited that  
I badgered Michael H. to get me on the list , I didn't want to wait to  
get my hands on MT.

MT would be perfect for me, I could use my core language and have a  
single language game base and use either MD or VS,(probably MD because  
my MBP has a 2 Gb limit and things get slow with two OS running).

I had started using MT for my second iphone app, loved what I seen and  
very excited about the future. However, reading the pricing the other  
day, I stopped using MT, I cann't justify the price even with a  
favourable exchange rate. So, I continue to monitor the mailing list  
by switching from XCode to Mail.

The product is true and I am very disappointed that I have been priced  
out of it.

Regards

Aidan
