<PRE>Guys,

Would it be possible to share some kind of idea on the timeline for future
bug fixes/releases of Monotouch with us please?  It would be really useful
for our planning to know how much effort to spend on workarounds for known
issues (such as the Reflection/[Preserve] bug that is apparently fixed in
1.1) compared to just holding off and working on other areas?

Many thanks and keep up the amazing work,

Mike
