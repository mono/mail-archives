<PRE>Joseph,

This is great - Can I confirm that a developer working for a large
enterprise, but as a sole iPhone developer in the organization can use the
$399 license please?

Secondly, how do you see the roadmap for the MonoTouch product offering
developing?  Specifically, do you see features like XAML being &quot;out of the
box if you're on support&quot;, or a separate additional charge?

I know I'll get shot down by hobby developers for whom this may not be so
true, but at $399 the cost saving of not having to bring in Objective-C
expertise and being able to use existing libraries for business application
development makes this a complete no-brainer for us.  Do keep up the great
work,

Mike

Subject: [MonoTouch] Pricing and Launch Details

Hello all

We're not making an official announcement regarding pricing and release
dates, yet; however, we now have pricing established internally, and the team
wanted to share this information since there have been a lot of people
anxiously inquiring.

Novell currently expects to launch MonoTouch next week.  Two editions will be
available:

MonoTouch Personal Edition:  $399/Developer A MonoTouch Personal Edition
license is owned by an individual.  The license is non-transferrable,
entitles the owner to one year of MonoTouch updates, and allows distribution
of applications built with MonoTouch on Apple's App Store. 

MonoTouch Enterprise Edition:  $999/Developer A MonoTouch Enterprise Edition
license is owned by a legal entity for use by one developer at any given
time, entitles the owner to one year of MonoTouch updates, and allows
enterprise deployments of MonoTouch applications, as well as the distribution
of applications built with MonoTouch on Apple's App Store.

The MonoTouch Enterprise Edition will also be offered as a 5-Developer
License at $3,999 (a 20% discount).

Please let me know if you have any questions about pricing, or about the
distinction between the two products.

Thanks for all of your help and feedback.

Joseph Hill
Product Manager for Mono
