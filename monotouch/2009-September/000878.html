I think Novell need to be careful... I have been down this path before - 
Borland Kylix. Never again. It was over priced and rushed to market 
because every developer raved about it being &quot;required&quot; in a survey (and 
it was very good), but absolutely over priced and absolutely failed to 
make any ground at all. Please Mono guys, don't repeat this - possibly 
one of Borland's most embarrassing and costly mistakes until they over 
engineered their .Net compiler and inadvertently tied it to Windows by 
poor forethought.

I beta tested Kylix 1, and the last field test (3 or 4 I think) just 
about worked, but was buggy as heck. How shocked I was when it was 
releaased soon after with many of the bugs still in place :-( Delphi 6 
beta (illiad) was even worse though, as the WYWIG Qt editor didn't even 
work properly under Windows. I digress....

Monotouch is doing so well functionality wise, but it isn't at a $399 
level yet.
