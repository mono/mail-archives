<PRE>Thanks for the update.

The pricing is actually double what I thought it might be (e.g $199 for personal edition and $499 for the enterprise). I have no doubt that you&amp;#39;ll have sales but this pricing will people put a lot more thought into whether or not they really need monotouch. I think it will hurt adoption rates so I am hoping a learning edition is in the works (e.g I am curious and interested in monotouch but can&amp;#39;t justify $399 for my curiousity right now) or as someone mentioned an introductory price is offered (to quickly establish a base of users).

Thanks,

John

</I>&gt;<i> Novell currently expects to launch MonoTouch next week.  Two editions will be available:
</I>&gt;<i> MonoTouch Personal Edition:  $399/Developer
</I>&gt;<i> A MonoTouch Personal Edition license is owned by an individual.  The license is non-transferrable, entitles the owner to one year of MonoTouch updates, and allows distribution of applications built with MonoTouch on Apple's App Store. 
</I>&gt;<i> MonoTouch Enterprise Edition:  $999/Developer
</I>&gt;<i> A MonoTouch Enterprise Edition license is owned by a legal entity for use by one developer at any given time, entitles the owner to one year of MonoTouch updates, and allows enterprise deployments of MonoTouch applications, as well as the distribution of applications built with MonoTouch on Apple's App Store.
</I>&gt;<i> The MonoTouch Enterprise Edition will also be offered as a 5-Developer License at $3,999 (a 20% discount).
</I>&gt;<i> Please let me know if you have any questions about pricing, or about the distinction between the two products.
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for all of your help and feedback.
