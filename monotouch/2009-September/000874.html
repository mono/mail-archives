<PRE>Not sure how that came across as me saying &quot;this is the only financial commitment&quot; but let's assume I did...

 

- Require the MacOS 

You also get a solid computer out of the deal so this isn't a financial commitment solely to do iphone dev 
- $99 whatever license fee to Apple

Ok, so $99 dollars
- Fight Apple policies if you want to sell your app on App Store

I guess you are talking about lawyering up?  I haven't heard of anyone doing that.  Either way I think you are just making a swipe at all the recent news about app store process (which I agree is shotty) but not a financial commitment
- Yes iPhone always get upgraded and require an upgrade for the dev tools, upgrading always comes to a price.

Well, we are talking if we went obj-c and upgrades to that are free as long as you have 1 and 2 on your list.  So another point with no relation to a financial commitment.

 

 

So let me be clearer.... I am not saying there is no financial commitment to do IPhone dev, and I am not even saying Monotouch isn't priced right.  All I was saying was personally upping that commitment an extra 400 might not work for me and that going down the Monotouch path is a little different from other dev tools (if I let my Resharper license expire, my code will still work) and that makes this particular decision point critical.

To develop for the iPhone you already have a financial commitment:

- Require the MacOS
- $99 whatever license fee to Apple
- Fight Apple policies if you want to sell your app on App Store
- Yes iPhone always get upgraded and require an upgrade for the dev tools, upgrading always comes to a price.

vs:

Write a Java ME program for a non- iPhone phone == priceless.

Just my opinion on what you said, not about the pricing of Monotouch (still working in my own head if I can justify/afford 400 a year as well).

 

People do complain about Apple prices, I think just about everyone does.

 

No one is trying to take money from fellow developers, Novell set the price and I would doubt the devs see any more money because of the price.  

 

 

About the price, I think it is fair but my only concern personally is making an app and 366 days later apple releases a new iphone sdk that my monotouch doesn't build against.  I doubt an upgrade renewal will be 400 but it is still a financial commitment.

Man so much complaining about a product that is not priced any higher than many dev tools - It seems almost disrespectful to the effort of the developers.

 

Let me say I know times are tough and for myself I don't know yet how I can afford more expenses, I also can't afford a proper Mac but i'm not going to ask apple to reduce their margIns.

 

Here's my algorithm:

 

If MT is not worth it don't buy, else proceed to next step

 

If I have the money buy it, else proceed to next step

 

if I have time and ability to do side projects then save up for MT, else proceed to next step

 

Consider going with objective-c.     It's not the end of the world.

 

AssetFailure(&quot;ask fellow developers to take less money for an innovative project&quot;)

 

Just my opinion-

Lee

	Hi!
	
	I'm pretty sure that this pricing will exclude all private and/or freeware developers, including me. For 399$ I can buy pretty much every Obj-C book an the market and change from C# to Obj-C. I prefer C# over Obj-C but not at any price.
	
	Of course, good work has to be paid, but this price is out of range for many developers. (I do know it is a pretty normal pricing for products like this.)
	
	Thanks!

	Hello all
	
	We're not making an official announcement regarding pricing and release dates, yet; however, we now have pricing established internally, and the team wanted to share this information since there have been a lot of people anxiously inquiring.
	
	Novell currently expects to launch MonoTouch next week.  Two editions will be available:
	
	MonoTouch Personal Edition:  $399/Developer
	A MonoTouch Personal Edition license is owned by an individual.  The license is non-transferrable, entitles the owner to one year of MonoTouch updates, and allows distribution of applications built with MonoTouch on Apple's App Store.
	
	MonoTouch Enterprise Edition:  $999/Developer
	A MonoTouch Enterprise Edition license is owned by a legal entity for use by one developer at any given time, entitles the owner to one year of MonoTouch updates, and allows enterprise deployments of MonoTouch applications, as well as the distribution of applications built with MonoTouch on Apple's App Store.
	
	The MonoTouch Enterprise Edition will also be offered as a 5-Developer License at $3,999 (a 20% discount).
	
	Please let me know if you have any questions about pricing, or about the distinction between the two products.
	
	Thanks for all of your help and feedback.
	
	Joseph Hill
	Product Manager for Mono
