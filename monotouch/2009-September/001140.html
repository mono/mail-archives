<PRE>I keep thinking of what Miguel said and that devs should opt-in. However this is a challenge because often support will be swamped with these types of questions anyways because most people don't read.

I'm starting to wonder if this is less of a &quot;what defaults do we pick&quot; and more of a &quot;how can the IDE educate the user&quot;.

One thing I've been learning from our recent product launches is educating the end-user goes a long way to the smoothness of the users experience and knowledge of the product.

I'm not sure what the best way to achieve this in an IDE is though.

Thanks and take care,
Simon

Subject: RE: [MonoTouch] exception when attempting to create XmlSerializer

My real point is it would seem there are probably a few common cases that can be heuristically detected to give us something that works optimally in more cases.

Most code doesn't explicitly use dynamic type instantiation nearly as often as the other features, so forget worrying about that edge case just document it well.

However there should not be mystery exceptions when doing common things like serialization, while at the same time keeping the app size as small as possible.

Lee

Hey,

The linker is a tool that statically analyzes assemblies. So whenever
you need a type or a member that is not statically referenced, you'll
have to instruct the linker, either by linking the SDK only, or by
applying a Preserve custom attribute, to well, preserve the type or
the member.

Indeed, the most common scenario is reflection, and everything that
uses it, such as dynamic type instantiation, or serialization.
