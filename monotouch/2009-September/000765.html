<PRE>I'm okay with the pricing you've listed below. $200 mark is okay for an
Indie version $400 is not. That's just too big of a leap for me. I'm not
saying that I won't pay it I just won't enjoy paying it.

 

$1000 for a pro version might be okay. I'd like to know the difference
between indie and pro in order to make that call. 

 

I think the point is that I have already spent thousands on software. I
really hate buying software. (I like getting paid for mine though - go
figure). 

 

Unity seems too high to get started. The cheapest iPhone basic is $400 if I
remember correctly. And I can't remember all the differences between their
versions.

 

I like monoTouch and am willing to pay for it. I'm also willing to be
labeled cheap too. That doesn't mean I already have a price in mind.

I can't believe you guys are all this cheap. Do you really think that
MonoTouch is only worth &lt;$50?   I paid something like $3000 for Unity Pro
and iPhone Pro, I've paid hundreds for Visual Studio, I've paid hundreds for
PhotoShop..... even RealBasic (the personal edition) costs $99.... the pro
version is like $299. ....  If you are using MonoTouch to create software to
the iPhone and you are a &quot;C# guy&quot;, MonoTouch is worth more than $50 for
sure.

 

I think a good pricing model would be MonoTouch Learning Edition for FREE...
and cripple it by only allowing it to run in the iPhone Simulator. The have
a Indie Version priced between $100 to $200 and then a Pro Version priced
between $500 to $1000.   Something like this.

I agree Kevin. I hope that MonoTouch would come in below the price of Unity.


 

I'm still willing to pay something to be able to use C# instead of Obj-C. 

Matt's  pricing was a good idea. I think the Indy level of Unity is a bit
out of reach. 

 

I would like to see some levels of licensing, but not sure what that would
entail or how that would look. 

Looking forward to seeing pricing though.

That order of pricing would reduce the likelihood of attracting existing
iPod developers pretty drastically, which would be a shame.

I don't have any inside knowledge but I assume it will be on this order:

I know this topic has popped up a few time on this list, but I never saw an
answer....

Any idea (at least a range) of what the cost of MonoTouch will be? 

I have a project code complete and ready to ship, I'm hoping that the price
I billed my client will (at least) cover the cost of me purchasing
MonoTouch.

 

Thanks.

Randy
