<PRE>Thanks - I just downloaded it from this URL and it still says 2.2 Beta 1, and
the app still fails.

Is there some specific way to upgrade MonoDevelop? - I'm just downloading,
running the installer and dragging/dropping the icon across as it says -
should I be uninstalling or something?

Thanks again,

Mike

You need the latest Mac build of MD, not 2.2b1. The url
<A HREF="http://monodevelop.com/Download/Mac_MonoTouch">http://monodevelop.com/Download/Mac_MonoTouch</A> always points at the latest MD
version needed for MonoTouch.

I'm running MonoDevelop 2.2 Beta 1 (2.1.0) and MonoTouch 1.02 (downloaded
this afternoon).  My application works fine on the simulator in MonoDevelop,
but crashs on the device and in XCode.

With XCode, I initially tried &quot;Run/Debug in XCode&quot; but it failed because I
have my XIB files in subdirectories and MonoDevelop didn't create the
necessary subdirectories.  Once they were created, the application also
crashes in the XCode simulator with an error

Unhandled Exception...UIViewController _loadViewFromNibNamed:bundle:] was
unable to load a nib named &quot;xxxxx&quot;

I know a fix went in to copy the XIB files to the root directory in
MonoDevelop - did this fix make it in to the XCode/Device deployment too?

Many thanks,

Mike
