<PRE>As far as I can see for the foreseeable future anybody that develops for the
iPhone platform *will* learn Objective-C, whether they want to or not.
Either that or write the same three apps forever.

If they don't they'll be at the very least cut off from code samples,
explanations etc. -  including all of the Apple documentation.

I just don't see that as practical.

It might be in time if a lot of C# developers take up MonoTouch (apart from
anything else, I suspect it will attract a lot of current .NETCF
developers), but the documentation issue will always be there. 

The effect this has on the pricing question is that it needs to be very
finely balanced - if MonoTouch is too expensive from the developer's
perspective then they'll choose good enough over better.

We also have to remember the pencil-thin margins on iPhone applications - it
would be nice to at least have a reasonable chance of recovering your
investment before the Moon escapes out into deep space...

Subject: Re: [MonoTouch] Commercial pricing ?

 

There hasn't been much discussion about what the different target markets
might be for MonoTouch -- John's comment crystalized it for me &quot;they'll
simply go the Objective-C route)&quot;.

I think MonoTouch has the potential to open up iPhone development to a new
set of programmers who actually can't/won't ever learn Objective-C... the
Microsoft-masses. Every corporate developer churning out ASP.NET stuff with
web services suddenly has a much lower barrier to entry (just learn
IB/NIB)... even that disappear altogether if &quot;MoonTouch&quot; eventuates (and
runs on Android) :)

These developers are probably more used to buying tools (point already made
previously), but also their employer might be the purchaser. I can see a lot
of potential Enterprise apps (BI, monitoring as well as
marketing/customer-related) being facilitated by MonoTouch - the biz code
and webservices already exist in .NET. 

So in addition to this discussion about Free/Indie/Pro there is another
pricepoint that will be important for Novell - Enterprise. Heck even Apple
charges $99 for one dev and $300(?) for 'Enterprise' signing. If $1000 for a
Pro licence is OK - what's an Enterprise licence worth? The military have
already produced iPod Touch apps - what a contract that would be for Novell
if the app development speed was doubled by MonoTouch over ObjC.

MonoTouch is a cool platform - and clearly a nice change from ObjC even for
those who know it well. But if Novell can get the pricing right (and the
samples/training/ecosystem going) I wonder if that market isn't going to be
quite small compared to the potential influx of experienced C# developers
(solo &amp; corporate) who want to jump on the iPhone bandwagon (*definitely* an
attractive bandwagon to jump on). If this 'big pent-up demand' does actually
exist, that's probably good for everyone (their cash pays Novell to keep the
price down and the whole thing running)... if only the people on this
mailing list ever end up licencing the tool -- that's not so good :-(

Whether this pans out or not... who knows. Whether this 'imagined' group
contributes lots to the AppStore or more to private apps... who knows. But
Novell has a very difficult decision to make (and a whole pile of marketing
work to do), that's for sure.

p.s. just my 2c

Hi,

Wow, quite the buzz around pricing.

As I mentioned before on another thread ideally a free (simulator only)
version will be enabled at some point in order to stimulate a community
around it (documentation and samples etc is something we can never have
enough of :) ). As someone pointed out, the higher the price the less people
will take it up (especially indie developers as they'll simply go the
Objective-C route). Since a free version can't be offered right now I hope
it does so soon after.

The rapid change during the beta has been great but people are still
identify issues and there are others still waiting in the wings to trial the
beta. Once it is priced and released expectations will be set and others
will base their decision based on what they hear from those who purchased it
soon after the release. If some people are pushing for a release could they
have something similar to Microsoft's Go Live license?

That way you could utilise the rest of the month to get more beta versions
out, invite the remaining people waiting to test it out (this will bring in
a fresh set of eyes to investigate the beta) and get the education/free
simulator version ready. This would give you the opportunity to take
advantage of the buzz around the release to get as many people as possible
to install MonoTouch and give it a try.

An affordable indie price would be good too :) (since you already have to
buy a MacBook and pay Apple $99 if you are a typical .net developer).

Cheers,

John

&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nothing to do with price, but i think the monotouch
</I>&gt;<i> progress has been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; phenomenal but really its seems to be at early/mid
</I>&gt;<i> beta level, not RTM

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although I agree, we are struggling on two sides: on one

</I>&gt;<i> the other the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that our plan to sell MonoTouch with one year of
