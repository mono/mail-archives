<PRE>Sandy, yes, I'm reading the same mailing list and followed quite a bit this
weekend as all the complaints came in about the price points unveiled
Friday.
Of all the emails coming through I never saw anything from Miguel mentioning
the concerns being discussed.

I understand that big corporations take time to work out pricing models and
that these prices were determined long before they were revealed to the Beta
Team. However, with that in mind, maybe Novell should have released the
prices to the Beta Team much earlier so that they could have take our
concerns to heart.

Giving the Beta Team the price list on Friday, seeing the flurry of concern
over the weekend and yet releasing on Monday with the same prices just
doesn't seem right.

If their was concern by the Mono/MonoTouch Team about the concern being
discussed here then maybe they should address it.... here or on the
MonoTouch web site.
