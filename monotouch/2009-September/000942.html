<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i>none of the Mexican side of my family makes very much money but 4 of them have iPhones
</I>
Now we're getting goofy here - Any relatives I have who don't have much money are not walking around with iPhones, more often they have a plain phone with a key or two missing.


I just hope whoever is right in this debate wins - so that we get a great .NET platform for iPhone that lives on indefinitely and builds a huge active community of developers.  What's the optimal price to get that and have paid developers, wish I knew for sure.

Subject: Re: [MonoTouch] Pricing and Licensing

Rebecca (and others) sorry for any confusion there.

My brother-in-law isn't paid an American Salary, I just converted his pesos to USD for comparison.

The reason I mentioned Mexico is because of Miguel. He came from Mexico and knows of the hardships his family and friends deal with there. He of all people know that the current price point being touted by Novell is beyond the reach of anyone in his country.

For anyone that is interested, many Mexicans do indeed &quot;own&quot; an iPhone. They are all jailbroken as their isn't an official carrier there that I know of but the Developers there all still want to develop for the iPhone even if it is expensive there. Just as an aside, none of the Mexican side of my family makes very much money but 4 of them have iPhones.

Based on the reactions we've seen here, I would hope that more thought will go into the pricing structure before final release.

An OpenSource Licensed version would be nice.

Companies like Jetbrains offer FREE or low cost licenses for people that do OpenSource Projects.

I believe Jetbrains are a little more particular... I think they need to see that you have active projects going on within the typical OpenSource communities (Github, CodePlex, Google Code, etc) and have a web site proving you are actually active in the OpenSource Community.

Jetbrain's way of doing this is not bad but it does prohibit hobbyist programmers from using their software.

I would like to see something in the way of an OpenSource or Hobbyist license.  Maybe requiring that any and all applications deployed with such a license must utilize a GPL, LGPL or any other such license. Heck, I would even be okay with a requirement to host my iPhone App Code on Github or somewhere for anyone to see to get a FREE or cheaper license.  Giving out your source code doesn't mean you can't make money off your apps.

At the current price point MonoTouch will whither away into obscurity when it comes to hobbyists and OpenSource Developers. Just take a poll any day of the week in the OpenSource/Free Software Community and you will find they all use Java, Python, Ruby and pretty much anything they don't have to pay for. Large Businesses and those with deep pockets will buy MonoTouch but people in the OpenSource Community and hobbyists such as myself who is also a parent and just enjoys writing apps for fun will have to just go the Objective-C route.

I can only assume that the software was not paid for at 3rd world country rates, but that the engineers are actually being paid American salaries.








Geoff, Miguel and Michael are in the US (Dollars);   JB is in France (Euros) and whoever else worked to get these things done is not likely being paid Mexican wages.



When it comes to your brother in law it seems an odd market to go into.








iPhones in Mexico are even more expensive than they are in the US.   The iPod Touch that just came out costs 199 dollars in the US, and costs 3,099 pesos in Mexico.  Someone in Mexico is paying 40 dollars more for the same product.

Subject: Re: [MonoTouch] Pricing and Licensing



David has a very good point and one you would think Miguel would appreciate, being from Mexico. He of all people should know that Developers in his home country don't get paid enough to afford MonoTouch which is probably why he lives in the United States.








My brother-in-law is a Software Architect working for an American Company in Mexico. They pay him only $15,000 U.S. Dollars a Year and he is not only an Architect but in charge of a large Team of Developers.



His company would never pay $400 for such a license, led alone $1,000 for an Enterprise/Developer Time Share

 License.
