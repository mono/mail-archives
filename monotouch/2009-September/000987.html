<PRE>I don't see a trial version on the mono site, is this temporarily something
that just hasn't been done yet, or actually part of the business plan?

For me, the $400 is something i'm happy to pay, once i've build a prototype
of an app, and the value has proven itself and i'm ready to start beta
testing.

Personally i think there should be an extended trial, where you can build
stuff, even deploy to handset (the simulate doesn't do enough for the things
i want to test), but not be able to do anything with it outside of DEV and
of course not be able to submit it to the store. That version could be
*crippled* with some embarassing things to discourage people making non
appstore apps for jailbroken phones or in company use etc.

since games is an area i'd have looked at monotouch seriously, now i think
unity sounds more of an option. and most of the other things are small
enough scale that i'll persist with Objective C

I hope as the months go on monotouch gets more mature, and a trial version
appears.

Good work all,

Karl
