<PRE>I can only assume that the software was not paid for at 3rd world country rates, but that the engineers are actually being paid American salaries.

Geoff, Miguel and Michael are in the US (Dollars);   JB is in France (Euros) and whoever else worked to get these things done is not likely being paid Mexican wages. 

When it comes to your brother in law it seems an odd market to go into.   

iPhones in Mexico are even more expensive than they are in the US.   The iPod Touch that just came out costs 199 dollars in the US, and costs 3,099 pesos in Mexico.  Someone in Mexico is paying 40 dollars more for the same product.

David has a very good point and one you would think Miguel would appreciate, being from Mexico. He of all people should know that Developers in his home country don't get paid enough to afford MonoTouch which is probably why he lives in the United States.

My brother-in-law is a Software Architect working for an American Company in Mexico. They pay him only $15,000 U.S. Dollars a Year and he is not only an Architect but in charge of a large Team of Developers.

His company would never pay $400 for such a license, led alone $1,000 for an Enterprise/Developer Time Share License.
