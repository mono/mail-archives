<PRE>Ha Ha Lee, you are exactly right.
When I heard that the first of them got an iPhone I said &quot;hey wait, you
can't even afford to pay your home telephone bill, why do you have an
iPhone&quot;.

It is sad but Mexican citizens carry more debt that any of us could possibly
imagine.

I used to work for a Debt Management / Education company and I asked them
why they didn't try to move into Mexico where people there really have debt
problems and they had this to say &quot;that country is a lost cause... those
people will always be in debt&quot;.

In the United States we buy houses, cars and electronics we can't really
afford but we do so because we really &quot;want&quot; them, we don't really &quot;need&quot;
them. A lot of times we do it just to keep up with our neighbors and
friends.  Unbeknownst to us, our friends and neighbors all put themselves
into debt just to try to keep up with us.

It is no different in Mexico.

I have seen where people in Mexico can't afford to pay all of their bills so
they will typically not pay their phone bill because even if you don't pay
your phone bill, you can get it next month and keep the same number. Those
that have more problems than that may stop paying electricity and have a
neighborhood friend &quot;hook'em up&quot;.

Sad but true, we all go into debt for our toys :-)

But I agree... let's forget about the economy in Mexico and focus on the
subject at hand... is their a way that Novell can bring this back... can
they set a price point that is more realistic and take hobbyist and
OpenSource Developers into account.

This beta has been filled with some great people.... I'm sure you all work
regular jobs but may also enjoy programming on the side for hobby, maybe you
even contribute to OpenSource Projects. That is great, but how many can
afford to toss $400 into a MonoTouch license to kick around at home?

Not many of us... believe me, I asked the wife and she said emphatically NO
:<i>-)
</I>
By the way, I just want to take a moment to say thanks to all of the people
contributing to Mono, MonoTouch and MonoDevelop. you guys are great and this
has been one of the best betas I've ever seen.

Kudos to all!

Now let's get it priced to sell :D

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Rebecca (and others) sorry for any confusion there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My brother-in-law isn't paid an American Salary, I just converted his pesos
</I>&gt;<i> to USD for comparison.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason I mentioned Mexico is because of Miguel. He came from Mexico and
</I>&gt;<i> knows of the hardships his family and friends deal with there. He of all
</I>&gt;<i> people know that the current price point being touted by Novell is beyond
</I>&gt;<i> the reach of anyone in his country.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For anyone that is interested, many Mexicans do indeed &quot;own&quot; an iPhone.
</I>&gt;<i> They are all jailbroken as their isn't an official carrier there that I know
</I>&gt;<i> of but the Developers there all still want to develop for the iPhone even if
</I>&gt;<i> it is expensive there. Just as an aside, none of the Mexican side of my
</I>&gt;<i> family makes very much money but 4 of them have iPhones.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Based on the reactions we've seen here, I would hope that more thought will
</I>&gt;<i> go into the pricing structure before final release.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An OpenSource Licensed version would be nice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Companies like Jetbrains offer FREE or low cost licenses for people that do
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSource Projects.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe Jetbrains are a little more particular... I think they need to
</I>&gt;<i> see that you have active projects going on within the typical OpenSource
</I>&gt;<i> communities (Github, CodePlex, Google Code, etc) and have a web site proving
</I>&gt;<i> you are actually active in the OpenSource Community.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Jetbrain's way of doing this is not bad but it does prohibit hobbyist
</I>&gt;<i> programmers from using their software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to see something in the way of an OpenSource or Hobbyist
</I>&gt;<i> license.  Maybe requiring that any and all applications deployed with such a
</I>&gt;<i> license must utilize a GPL, LGPL or any other such license. Heck, I would
</I>&gt;<i> even be okay with a requirement to host my iPhone App Code on Github or
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere for anyone to see to get a FREE or cheaper license.  Giving out
</I>&gt;<i> your source code doesn't mean you can't make money off your apps.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the current price point MonoTouch will whither away into obscurity when
</I>&gt;<i> it comes to hobbyists and OpenSource Developers. Just take a poll any day of
</I>&gt;<i> the week in the OpenSource/Free Software Community and you will find they
</I>&gt;<i> all use Java, Python, Ruby and pretty much anything they don't have to pay
</I>&gt;<i> for. Large Businesses and those with deep pockets will buy MonoTouch but
</I>&gt;<i> people in the OpenSource Community and hobbyists such as myself who is also
</I>&gt;<i> a parent and just enjoys writing apps for fun will have to just go the
</I>&gt;<i> Objective-C route.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> David has a very good point and one you would think Miguel would appreciate, being from Mexico. He of all people should know that Developers in his home country don't get paid enough to afford MonoTouch which is probably why he lives in the United States.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My brother-in-law is a Software Architect working for an American Company in Mexico. They pay him only $15,000 U.S. Dollars a Year and he is not only an Architect but in charge of a large Team of Developers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> His company would never pay $400 for such a license, led alone $1,000 for an Enterprise/Developer Time Share
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  License.
