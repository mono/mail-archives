<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>I recently started playing around with MapKit via MonoTouch. At first I
struggled, but in the end got this sample working:
<A HREF="http://conceptdev.blogspot.com/2009/09/monotouch-mapkit-101.html">http://conceptdev.blogspot.com/2009/09/monotouch-mapkit-101.html</A>

One of the issues I had was needing to
[Export(&quot;reverseGeocoder:didFindPlacemark:&quot;)]
because it wasn't already on MKReverseGeocoderDelegate - not a big deal,
just a learning experience.

*BUT *I still haven't figured out MKAnnotation,
MKMapViewDelegate.GetViewForAnnotation() and MKMapView.AddAnnotation(). No
matter what combination of stuff I try, it manages to crash [SIGSEGV]
&quot;warning: Trying to remove a section from the ordered section list that did
not exist at 0x2d2000&quot; (misaligned stack bug?).
You can look at the most recent 'attempt' in the sample code at
<A HREF="http://conceptdevelopment.net/iPhone/MapKit01/Main.cs.htm">http://conceptdevelopment.net/iPhone/MapKit01/Main.cs.htm</A>
(the AddAnnotation() call is commented out, but the related MKAnnotation and
MKMapViewDelegate code is all there). Based on Console.WriteLine it crashes
after GetViewForAnnotation() returns...

Basically I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong... suggestions welcome!


I also have a related question to ask - what is the plan for
handling/implementing ObjC @protocol in C#? It's kinda hard to explain, but
here goes (and apols in advance if I've missed the point!):

1) @protocols seem &quot;kinda&quot; like C# Interfaces in that a @protocol defines
interface ONLY, and classes can implement multiple @protocols

2) @protocols are different to C# Interfaces in that members can be
'optionally' implemented

3) MKAnnotation
&lt;<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/MapKit/Reference/MKAnnotation_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html">http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/MapKit/Reference/MKAnnotation_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html</A>&gt;is
a @protocol, with one required property (coordinate) and two optional
(title, subtitle)

4) In *MonoTouch*, MKAnnotation is an *abstract class* with (title,
subtitle) properties and coordinate as an *abstract property*. That kinda
makes sense in terms of 'modelling' the @protocol

5) BUT in ObjC &quot;A placemark
&lt;<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/MapKit/Reference/MKPlacemark_Class/Reference/Reference.html">http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/MapKit/Reference/MKPlacemark_Class/Reference/Reference.html</A>&gt;is
also an annotation and conforms to the
MKAnnotation&lt;<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/MapKit/Reference/MKAnnotation_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/intf/MKAnnotation">http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/MapKit/Reference/MKAnnotation_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/intf/MKAnnotation</A>&gt;protocol,
whose properties and methods include the placemark coordinate and
other information. *Because they are annotations, you can add them directly
to the map view*.&quot;
ie. MKMapVew.AddAnnotation() takes an MKAnnotation @protocol parameter which
means it will accept an MKAnnotation class (or subclass) *AND ALSO an
MKPlacemark instance*.

6) HOWEVER in C# the method definition is MKMapView.AddAnnotation
(MKAnnotation annotation) ... meaning it will accept any implementation of
the abstract MKAnnotation subclass but NOT an MKPlacemark.

So part of my problem was successfully getting an MKPlacemark back in my
code but not being able to add it to the MKMapView directly, and also not
being able to construct a valid MKAnnotation subclass that would
successfully add to the MKMapView. It seems more logical to me that
MonoTouch provide both an IMKAnnotation and abstract class
MKAnnotation:IMKAnnotation
so that methods can accept the interface as a parameter... of course I've no
idea how this would translate into the compiler (but it *is *already
stripping out the ModelNotImplementedExceptions)...
