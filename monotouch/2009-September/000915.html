<PRE>For me as a New Zealander it's even worse L (not only is the exchange rate
unfavourable, but we get paid less than developers in the US).

 

I think I'll have to see if I can earn anything from the App Store, and then
pick up MT later.

For now I'll probably have to settle for &quot;(Barely) Good Enough&quot; (Obj-C) over
&quot;(Much) Better&quot;.

I won't argue that the price is unfair, but I do believe it will present a
barrier to many individual developers. There's no point in second-guessing
pricing decisions since setting prices for software is after all not what I
do for a living, but from my perspective it seems at least plausible that
selling more units at half the price at the low end would have been
beneficial to rapidly gaining mindshare.

Like Ali I had to buy a machine to do development on (and in my case I'll
also be shelling out for an iPod Touch shortly), so my ability to absorb
additional expense is lower than other people's might be - but it shouldn't
be forgotten that people who are completely new to the Apple ecosystem are
among the most likely customers for MonoTouch (after all, half the &quot;native&quot;
Cocoa/Cocoa Touch developers won't even use dot notation, so I don't see
them admitting C# has any value without lots of positive examples and a not
inconsiderable elapse of time...hence the value of a rapid and early
expansion of mindshare so there are plenty of those positive examples to
point to).

Subject: [MonoTouch] Pricing and Licensing

 

Before I say anything else, I have to say you cannot put a price on a piece
of art and good software is the ultimate form of art IMHO. MonoTouch is
something in the order of a miracle to me.

 

Now my criticism of the pricing:

To have an ongoing community of MonoTouch developers, it needs to be viable.
I had to go and buy a mac, then I have to pay a yearly $100 for my apple
license then a yearly $400 for MonoTouch and then how much do I earn? apart
from the odd $100 TomTom app, the expected price of an iPhone app is in the
order of $1 to a $5. I don't have any estimate on the volume of sales and
it's very widely different depending on your source. I have to invest my
time and learn the framework, fortunately I can now skip the ObjectiveC
torture, but can I justify all this? and for me as an Australian, everything
is even more expensive than you guys in US.

Ali
