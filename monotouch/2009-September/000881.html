<PRE>Wow $399 really?  This seems out of alignment with the development
experience one expects from a product in that price range.  If Visual Studio
Pro with Resharper is a 10 and Notepad is a 0, then MonoDevelop is about a
3.  No native debugging, only the most basic code navigation, no refactoring
capabilities, only the most basic real time syntax checking, missing
libraries (CoreData), and so on.

I understand that the price is not for MonoDevelop, which is open source,
but for the libs and plugin.  But I hope that Novell understands that this
is a moot distinction.  The potential customer is not the current
MonoDevelop user, it's the Visual Studio user.  They should consider the
&quot;whole product.&quot;  And for the VS developer, MonoDevelop/MonoTouch feels like
a step back 10 years.  The documentation suggests the best debugging
strategy is Console.WriteLine.  Whoa.  I have not done anything like that
since I last wrote &quot;alert('I'm here')&quot; in Javascript about 4 years ago.

You might say that my comparison with VS misses the point; that the
competition is ObjC/Xcode.  I cannot speak to the dev experience using those
tools; I have heard it's poor.  But the real competitor is not objC, it's
non-adoption.  Adoption begets adoption.  A real community emerges.  OSS
tools are created and heartily adopted.  Blog articles spring up with
increasing frequency.  Everything gets easier.  It starts to feel like a
safe bet to dive in.  Finally the platform reaches &quot;escape velocity.&quot;  New
and more expensive editions appear with cool advanced capabilities: testing,
source code repo integration, load testing, profiling, yadda yadda.  I fear
that with this pricing, MonoTouch might never reach escape velocity.  It
will live a meager life in a small corner of the .NET dev world.

Short of reducing the price, Novell should absolutely provide a crippled
version for free, as others have suggested.  Devs are hard pressed to shell
out cash until they see what a platform can do -- if it's a keeper.  Once
they decide they will use it repeatedly for real production apps, it's not
so hard to write a check.  If there's no free learning version, it's kinda
like buying an expensive suit that might not fit from a store with a &quot;no
returns&quot; policy.  This store will not succeed.
