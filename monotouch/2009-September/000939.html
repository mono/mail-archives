<PRE>That does make sense, in my opinion.

Of course, you are right. It is worth the price when it boosts your
productivity, but.....

There are many independent developers out there doing awesome work. But many
can not afford to spent at least 400$ to be able to use C# instead of Obj-C.
400$ is much money for a guy with family, no matter in which country you
live.

I think it is (at least at this point) more important to build a healthy
user group than making money from the first moment on. Maybe it would make
more sense to diversify the licensing. One that benefits the small
developers.

Something like this:

49$-99$ - Private use and only for free apps. (or only for open-source apps,
something the community would benefit from)
99$-149$ - After-work developers with paid apps.
399$ - One developer licence for companies.
3999$ - Company licence.

Just a thought!

 That doesn&#8217;t make any sense.



First of all you&#8217;re getting into world economics and regional pricing which
is a separate conversation.  How can the same person afford $100-200 on
Windows?  The answer is sometimes companies have regional pricing or
sometimes people don&#8217;t have a good option, but that&#8217;s a debate for the
entire industry not specific to MT.



Secondly even if you go down this path &#8211; most of the worlds professional
software developers make $10/hour or more.  At this rate it doesn&#8217;t take a
huge boost in productivity to justify a week&#8217;s salary.  Would I hate it?
Yes.  Would it make sense if I was 25% more productive?  No question.

David has a very good point and one you would think Miguel would appreciate,
being from Mexico. He of all people should know that Developers in his home
country don't get paid enough to afford MonoTouch which is probably why he
lives in the United States.



My brother-in-law is a Software Architect working for an American Company in
Mexico. They pay him only $15,000 U.S. Dollars a Year and he is not only an
Architect but in charge of a large Team of Developers.



His company would never pay $400 for such a license, led alone $1,000 for an
Enterprise/Developer Time Share License.



As you can imagine, on a salary of $15,000 USD (before Taxes) with a family
of 4, my brother-in-law has to do several side jobs to make ends meat.  He
was counting on MonoTouch to usher him into iPhone Application Development
but at a price of $400 USD, he will definitely have to pass.



When I look at Microsoft, I think greed... greed for Money, greed for Power.



When I look at Novel and the way they have fostered the development of SUSE
and it's FREE counterpart OpenSUSE and then MONO I see a business that
understands the difference between Enterprise Businesses, the Freedom of
OpenSource and Hobbyists together, but it would appear they have totally
missed the mark with this price point.



Is their any opportunity for an OpenMonoTouch?  Community Support Only

It is the same story anywhere south of the U.S border. How anybody
could afford $400 dollars for a single product when they earn an
average of $600 - $1000/month?
