<PRE>I&#8217;ll throw my $.02 worth in on this, though, its only worth what you pay for it.

 

I have to agree with the idea that MT doesn&#8217;t feel like a $400 product.  I&#8217;m not saying that it won&#8217;t eventually.  A lot of that on my end has been a general frustration with MD.  Not that MD is a bad product, but I have had a few stability problems with it.  MD is the interface into MT.  Without a really solid MD, its hard to take MT as an enterprise ready platform.  Yes, folks whine and complain about VS.NET, but I have had many fewer problems with beta copies of Vs.NET over the years than I have had with MD in the past month or so.  Hopefully, the issues with MD will be resolved with the MD 2.2 version slated for October.  As I see things, until MD is available as an RTM product, MT really isn&#8217;t finished product.

 

JimZ made a great comment about MT being like a component that is purchased from a vendor.  I whole heartedly agree on that.  However, I do feel that MT is bring a lot to the table.  MT is opening up the iPhone/touch devices, the sexiest mobile devices out there, to .NET developers, which are the largest group of developers.  Surely, there is some value in that for developers.  With $399 being an indivual price, I would definitely suggest an introductory price.  Signup in the first 12 months, and its $99 for an individual developer or something like that.  Novell will need to overcome the requirement of getting a mac and those other extra cost issues (mac dev license, pain of getting into the app store, and general new platform issues).  

 

The comments about the track record for MT are also appropriate.  It may not seem like much to a community of developers, but CIOs, CTOs, and Development Managers want to know about support and track records.  By having an introductory discount, these people may very well take chances on the product.  When the introductory pricing period is over, there is no need for a price increase, the price settles in and the cost is whatever the normal price is, with no actual price increases.

 

My suggestion for marketplace acceptance is to have an introductory price and market the heck out of the product (something developers are horrible at).

 

Wally

Subject: Re: [MonoTouch] Pricing - Dont be a baby

 

I pretty much agree with most of what you said.

I'd just like to stress my own &quot;feeling&quot; that MT isn't a $400 product as of yet.
I have no problem of trust in the MT team and Novell that they would eventually make it a product worth much more
But I'm not sure if this will happen within a 12 month Time-Frame (which, from what I gather is &quot;current&quot; proposed support period).

I would think that if Novell came up with a scheme where &quot;us&quot; beta testers get a longer period of support (I dare say... prepetual-ish?)
I could justify this price to myself...

personally i'm fine paying $399 even though i'd rather not. The main thing is that i have access to the tools BEFORE i have to pay. I typically have a number of projects going on, and will use third party components to help them get going.. 8 or of 10 projects i nix along time before they get anywhere finished. (maybe i loose interest, they seem too much effort, or my market research shows its not worth it). And so those projects die. I just used a trial version of a component, and i don't purchase.

 

HOWEVER, for those 2 out of 10, suddenly i've put a good number of hours into them, have a plan, and are going to release them (whether commercial or freeware), and thats the point that i'm willing to pay the $399. I've burnt myself too many times before buying a library with all good intentions to use it and never getting around to it other than just some playing.

 

And i think that most people here complaining, would even begrudgingly , put out the $399 once they had a completed app ready to submit to the appstore.

 

plus also value wise, there have been few libraries that i've used that haven't saved me SOOO much time and dollars not having to reinvent the wheel. With developer salaries being at least $50 an hour. If monotouch saves you just 8 hours over obj-C then its worth it.

My biggest fear with monotouch, is that because its so foundational, and potentially so huge, its a risk factor if i invest in building a large code base in monotouch, and there are just issues after issues, and its not updated enough, and breaks with future SDK updates etc. The fear of it becoming the ugly step sister. (i loved delphi, and its huge community in the day, but hated having to transcribe and hack C headers over all the time from the MS SDKs to do anything OS'sy - BORLAND KYLIX that somebody mentioned is exactly my point here. I was excited about that, but thankfully didn't have the time, or need to jump on that bandwagon, so suffered no pain)

 

However given that iphone projects are typically of a smaller scale i don't have that fear with monotouch.

 

There are some areas i wouldn't dare venture into with monotouch (i.e my streaming radio playing app), and even there obj-C wasn't bare boned enough to pull that job off alone, but i also am investing time into learning OBJ-C, not just because i'm a language nerd, but because i want to &quot;get&quot; the apple mindset, since it will help me all around, even if i have to put up with watching annoying condescending apple training videos where they talk far too slow and talk to you like you are not a developer but a graphics designer or something.

I think Novell need to be careful... I have been down this path before -
Borland Kylix. Never again. It was over priced and rushed to market
because every developer raved about it being &quot;required&quot; in a survey (and
it was very good), but absolutely over priced and absolutely failed to
make any ground at all. Please Mono guys, don't repeat this - possibly
one of Borland's most embarrassing and costly mistakes until they over
engineered their .Net compiler and inadvertently tied it to Windows by
poor forethought.

I beta tested Kylix 1, and the last field test (3 or 4 I think) just
about worked, but was buggy as heck. How shocked I was when it was
releaased soon after with many of the bugs still in place :-( Delphi 6
beta (illiad) was even worse though, as the WYWIG Qt editor didn't even
work properly under Windows. I digress....

Monotouch is doing so well functionality wise, but it isn't at a $399
level yet.
