<PRE>Hello 

I would like to thank everyone for the feedback that you have provided, 
and would like to let you know that we understand that you have some 
very valid concerns.  We will be taking steps in the next weeks to address 
many of these, some actions will take longer than others, but we definitely
want to do what we can today.

First off, I would like to make the distinction between the license and 
subscription.  A purchased MonoTouch license does not expire, so
after the year, you are free to continue to use MonoTouch and distribute
your applications.  I know there is concern about breaking changes 
in the OS after a year; however, Apple has historically worked to keep 
new iPhone OS releases backwards compatible with existing apps, and 
the apps built with the 2.2 SDK still run on iPhone today.  Many iPhone 
developers continue to develop against the 2.2 SDK as the lowest
common denominator.  To that end, you could continue using your 
MonoTouch license after the subscription expired, targeting the latest 
SDK version that your license supported.  The majority of companies 
we have engaged are still targeting iPhoneOS 2.2 without issues.

Second, we don't have renewal or upgrade pricing yet; however, 
we will make that available when we can, and you can expect this price
to be significantly reduced from the initial price.

Regardless, for beta testers, I'm happy to report that we are going to 
take the extra step of offering a second year of updates, free, if you 
buy MonoTouch between launch and October 31, 2009.  Just send an 
email to <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monotouch">monotouch at novell.com</A> from the address you used for the beta 
requesting this, and we will create the extension at that time.

Finally, I would like to address the concerns about community.  The 
MonoTouch team is very interested in continuing to grow and foster the 
community that has developed here, and we will be working proactively 
to introduce programs that help you .  You've given us some
great suggestions regarding limited versions and trials, which we've
already been considering, and we will make a determination about the
best solution for hobby developers in the very near future.

While we work to address that, we will issue a final RC release this 
weekend that will continue to work for 2 weeks after the launch.

Please let us know if you have any other concerns or suggestions.

Thank you
Joseph 

</PRE>
