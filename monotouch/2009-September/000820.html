<PRE>I think there is a very real opportunity with the .NET developers who've
been as you say holding out in Windows Mobile land, because as one of those
people (from the beginning) I can say the .NET development story on WM is
far from satisfactory. Microsoft seem to regard the Compact Framework as
little more than a scripting language, and have failed to make good use of
it or integrate it well with the operating system - I had high hopes for
Silverlight for Mobile, but that's now entered Duke Nukem Forever territory.


So MonoTouch + iPhone SDK is a very attractive proposition, especially with
that huge potential market (although the margins are as I've said before
seriously crappy).

If Novell are able to keep the price within reach for independent
developers, MonoTouch could prove to be the proverbial rising tide.

By that I mean that I'm telling lots of my .NET friends about monotouch, and
they are all interested, but many of them have avoided the iphone
specifically because they cannot develop on it. They have held out in
Windows Mobile land, or they have placed their trust in google and use a G1.

 

For you mono folks who don't know, Wally is one of the louder voices in the
MS .NET community. He is a great guy to have talking up your product.

 

Hi Wally Smile emoticon

I personally doubt it my babbling will have any effect on anything besides
my need to talk, however, that has never stopped me before.

 

I think that there are some existing .NET developers that will start
developing for the iPhone based on MonoTouch and MonoDevelop.  Not quite
sure how many, but I think that there are some. My friends are asking a few
questions about MonoTouch because they know I'm writing on it.  I'm
personally very excited about MonoTouch.  I'm not sure how many that will
be.  Pricing will help.  If Novell wants to really push the product, I think
a marketing campaign will provide more benefit to expanding the fact that a
.NET developer will be able to develop for the iPhone.  There are tons of
devs that won't know about this because it doesn't come in the .NET box.
I'm planning on telling people about the product because I am very
interested.  I'm writing an ebook and will be trying to get out and do some
talks on the subject.  Market penetration for MonoTouch will take some time,
hopefully, it will grow!

Subject: Re: [MonoTouch] Commercial pricing ?

 

There hasn't been much discussion about what the different target markets
might be for MonoTouch -- John's comment crystalized it for me &quot;they'll
simply go the Objective-C route)&quot;.

I think MonoTouch has the potential to open up iPhone development to a new
set of programmers who actually can't/won't ever learn Objective-C... the
Microsoft-masses. Every corporate developer churning out ASP.NET stuff with
web services suddenly has a much lower barrier to entry (just learn
IB/NIB)... even that disappear altogether if &quot;MoonTouch&quot; eventuates (and
runs on Android) :)

These developers are probably more used to buying tools (point already made
previously), but also their employer might be the purchaser. I can see a lot
of potential Enterprise apps (BI, monitoring as well as
marketing/customer-related) being facilitated by MonoTouch - the biz code
and webservices already exist in .NET. 

So in addition to this discussion about Free/Indie/Pro there is another
pricepoint that will be important for Novell - Enterprise. Heck even Apple
charges $99 for one dev and $300(?) for 'Enterprise' signing. If $1000 for a
Pro licence is OK - what's an Enterprise licence worth? The military have
already produced iPod Touch apps - what a contract that would be for Novell
if the app development speed was doubled by MonoTouch over ObjC.

MonoTouch is a cool platform - and clearly a nice change from ObjC even for
those who know it well. But if Novell can get the pricing right (and the
samples/training/ecosystem going) I wonder if that market isn't going to be
quite small compared to the potential influx of experienced C# developers
(solo &amp; corporate) who want to jump on the iPhone bandwagon (*definitely* an
attractive bandwagon to jump on). If this 'big pent-up demand' does actually
exist, that's probably good for everyone (their cash pays Novell to keep the
price down and the whole thing running)... if only the people on this
mailing list ever end up licencing the tool -- that's not so good :-(

Whether this pans out or not... who knows. Whether this 'imagined' group
contributes lots to the AppStore or more to private apps... who knows. But
Novell has a very difficult decision to make (and a whole pile of marketing
work to do), that's for sure.

Hi,

Wow, quite the buzz around pricing.

As I mentioned before on another thread ideally a free (simulator only)
version will be enabled at some point in order to stimulate a community
around it (documentation and samples etc is something we can never have
enough of :) ). As someone pointed out, the higher the price the less people
will take it up (especially indie developers as they'll simply go the
Objective-C route). Since a free version can't be offered right now I hope
it does so soon after.

The rapid change during the beta has been great but people are still
identify issues and there are others still waiting in the wings to trial the
beta. Once it is priced and released expectations will be set and others
will base their decision based on what they hear from those who purchased it
soon after the release. If some people are pushing for a release could they
have something similar to Microsoft's Go Live license?

That way you could utilise the rest of the month to get more beta versions
out, invite the remaining people waiting to test it out (this will bring in
a fresh set of eyes to investigate the beta) and get the education/free
simulator version ready. This would give you the opportunity to take
advantage of the buzz around the release to get as many people as possible
to install MonoTouch and give it a try.

An affordable indie price would be good too :) (since you already have to
buy a MacBook and pay Apple $99 if you are a typical .net developer).

Cheers,

John
