<PRE>Man so much complaining about a product that is not priced any higher than many dev tools - It seems almost disrespectful to the effort of the developers.

Let me say I know times are tough and for myself I don't know yet how I can afford more expenses, I also can't afford a proper Mac but i'm not going to ask apple to reduce their margIns.

Here's my algorithm:

If MT is not worth it don't buy, else proceed to next step

If I have the money buy it, else proceed to next step

if I have time and ability to do side projects then save up for MT, else proceed to next step

Consider going with objective-c.     It's not the end of the world.

AssetFailure(&quot;ask fellow developers to take less money for an innovative project&quot;)

Just my opinion-

Hi!

I'm pretty sure that this pricing will exclude all private and/or freeware developers, including me. For 399$ I can buy pretty much every Obj-C book an the market and change from C# to Obj-C. I prefer C# over Obj-C but not at any price.

Of course, good work has to be paid, but this price is out of range for many developers. (I do know it is a pretty normal pricing for products like this.)

Thanks!

Hello all

We're not making an official announcement regarding pricing and release dates, yet; however, we now have pricing established internally, and the team wanted to share this information since there have been a lot of people anxiously inquiring.

Novell currently expects to launch MonoTouch next week.  Two editions will be available:

MonoTouch Personal Edition:  $399/Developer
A MonoTouch Personal Edition license is owned by an individual.  The license is non-transferrable, entitles the owner to one year of MonoTouch updates, and allows distribution of applications built with MonoTouch on Apple's App Store.

MonoTouch Enterprise Edition:  $999/Developer
A MonoTouch Enterprise Edition license is owned by a legal entity for use by one developer at any given time, entitles the owner to one year of MonoTouch updates, and allows enterprise deployments of MonoTouch applications, as well as the distribution of applications built with MonoTouch on Apple's App Store.

The MonoTouch Enterprise Edition will also be offered as a 5-Developer License at $3,999 (a 20% discount).

Please let me know if you have any questions about pricing, or about the distinction between the two products.

Thanks for all of your help and feedback.

Joseph Hill
Product Manager for Mono
