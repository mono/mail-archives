<PRE>I was all excited to be using c# instead of objective c, which I  
strongly dislike, but I did take the tome to learn it and have a  
couple apps that are 80 percent done in obj c.  I was starting to  
migrate the apps to monotouch, but now am second guessing that idea.   
I was expecting around $199 or $99 for peronal edition like the $99 I  
already had to pay and the $599 for the mac mini.

Your pricing resembles what we normally see for control suites in  
visual studio which is probably where you got your pricing structure.   
This would make sense if I could write an iPhone app and stay in  
windows and visual studio but that is not technically possible  
leagally cause of apple's draconian measures to not allow or support  
virtualizaion.

Anyway, I think if you want to know the sweet spot for most of us it  
will be 99 to 199.  Anymore will be hard to justify to the wife when I  
already convinced her to let me buy the mini and get the iPhone sdk  
which I have to renew yearly.  As much as I hate obj - c, I need the  
price to be lower to justify it.

Don't get me wrong, I don't mind paying, but it needs to be lower than  
399 or else you will not have much of a community.

This is the best beta team I have seen and the support has been  
unbelievable!

Thanks
Jim

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Novell currently expects to launch MonoTouch next week.  Two  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> editions will be available:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MonoTouch Personal Edition:  $399/Developer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A MonoTouch Personal Edition license is owned by an individual.   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The license is non-transferrable, entitles the owner to one year of  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MonoTouch updates, and allows distribution of applications built  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with MonoTouch on Apple's App Store.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MonoTouch Enterprise Edition:  $999/Developer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A MonoTouch Enterprise Edition license is owned by a legal entity  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for use by one developer at any given time, entitles the owner to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one year of MonoTouch updates, and allows enterprise deployments of  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MonoTouch applications, as well as the distribution of applications  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> built with MonoTouch on Apple's App Store.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The MonoTouch Enterprise Edition will also be offered as a 5- 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Developer License at $3,999 (a 20% discount).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Please let me know if you have any questions about pricing, or  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about the distinction between the two products.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for all of your help and feedback.
