<PRE>Yeah I don't think the marketing 'tag-line' of  'if you think it's not
worth it don't buy it, go use objective-c'
is going to fly in any competing marketing department, as most people
probably will - and Novell would've just lost a prospective customer
interested in their product.

The point is we all want to use this technology, we all want to see a
community and support around it and we all want to see it succeed.

Novell should be rewarded for its efforts, but the fact is that a
personal licence of $399 is going to price most indie / hobby
developers out - (which probably is the majority of all developers,
judging by the median quality of the apps in the AppStore). This in
turn means a smaller community and less supporting documentation,
blogs and tutorials as a result - something which no-one wants to see
happen.

Obviously Novell's product department has looked at the potential
market segment and have made projections on sales and prices based on
it in order to maximize their revenue, I just would've thought that
since most of iPhone developers are indie/hobbyists that a licence
tailored for them would make financial sense.

Maybe a Lite-version with no frills or support could be in the works?

&gt;<i> Man so much complaining about a product that is not priced any higher than
</I>&gt;<i> many dev tools - It seems almost disrespectful to the effort of the
</I>&gt;<i> developers.
</I>&gt;<i> Let me say I know times are tough and for myself I don't know yet how I can
</I>&gt;<i> afford more expenses, I also can't afford a proper Mac but i'm not going to
</I>&gt;<i> ask apple to reduce their margIns.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's my algorithm:
</I>&gt;<i> If MT is not worth it don't buy, else proceed to next step
</I>&gt;<i> If I have the money buy it, else proceed to next step
</I>&gt;<i> if I have time and ability to do side projects then save up for MT, else
</I>&gt;<i> proceed to next step
</I>&gt;<i> Consider going with objective-c. &#160; &#160; It's not the end of the world.
</I>&gt;<i> AssetFailure(&quot;ask fellow developers to take less money for an innovative
</I>&gt;<i> project&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> Just my opinion-

</I>&gt;<i> Hi!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm pretty sure that this pricing will exclude all private and/or freeware
</I>&gt;<i> developers, including me. For 399$ I can buy pretty much every Obj-C book an

</I>&gt;<i> any price.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, good work has to be paid, but this price is out of range for many

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hello all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We're not making an official announcement regarding pricing and release
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dates, yet; however, we now have pricing established internally, and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> team wanted to share this information since there have been a lot of people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anxiously inquiring.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Novell currently expects to launch MonoTouch next week. &#160;Two editions will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be available:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MonoTouch Personal Edition: &#160;$399/Developer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A MonoTouch Personal Edition license is owned by an individual. &#160;The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> license is non-transferrable, entitles the owner to one year of MonoTouch
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> updates, and allows distribution of applications built with MonoTouch on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Apple's App Store.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MonoTouch Enterprise Edition: &#160;$999/Developer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A MonoTouch Enterprise Edition license is owned by a legal entity for use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by one developer at any given time, entitles the owner to one year of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MonoTouch updates, and allows enterprise deployments of MonoTouch
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> applications, as well as the distribution of applications built with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MonoTouch on Apple's App Store.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The MonoTouch Enterprise Edition will also be offered as a 5-Developer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> License at $3,999 (a 20% discount).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Please let me know if you have any questions about pricing, or about the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distinction between the two products.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for all of your help and feedback.
