The way I see it is - there are two main camps of people that will come 
to MonoTouch from the .Net world -

1) Hobbyist/indy developers - they paid the $99 and want to throw up a 
bunch of small &quot;free&quot; or &quot;low cost&quot; apps and may fall back on in app ads 
to bolster their ROI.
2) Corporations that want to either build iPhone apps that compliment 
their desktop lines or create bespoke solutions on a corporate level.

Camp #1 are individuals, much like myself, that paid the $99 out of 
their own pocket and would like to leverage their current skills instead 
of relearning everything or (as in my case) losing a lot of code they've 
already written and are happy with. Camp 1 have no great expectations on 
how much revenue their app will make - they either hope to break even or 
&quot;get lucky&quot;, but have no idea if that will be the case.

Camp #2 are companies with a large developer base and who are expecting 
to either make a large profit on their investment (as in their app will 
generate a big chunk of revenue), want loss leaders that draw people in 
to their product line (apps that point to a service such as DropBox or 
Spotify for example), or want to develop apps for use in specific closed 
environments (and therefore have a corporate developer's account with 
Apple.)

If you price camp #1 out of the picture, you meed to rely on camp #2. 
But camp #2 is not a great money spinner as the types of companies that 
would take up such an agreement are just as likely to subcontract if 
they are looking for a fast turn around.

This is the logic behind my pricing. You don't penalise the individual 
for being an individual, but you by the same token don't undersell your 
product in high end markets. The indy edition can be extremely cut down 
- look at what Borland/Codegear did with Delphi 2005 and &quot;Turbo Delphi&quot;. 
The turbo edition was free, free for commercial development and worked 
just fine, but the compiler was limited to IDE only use and the library 
was non extendible in a way that would hurt long term developers (no 
visual components could be added, so developers being &quot;cheap&quot; could not 
cut corners unless they used only shipped components.) Visual Studio is 
also interesting - the Express version also now allows commercial 
development, the main caveat is that the feature set has been restricted 
and the more Enterprise features removed.

For me, I have an app that I have agreed to write for a friends website 
venture. It's really simple. Pretty much just an RSS feed reader that 
displays images in the feed submitted by users. I originally &quot;proof of 
concept&quot;'d the code in C#, ported it to Adobe Air (to allow for cross 
platform on the desktop) and could pretty easily use the existing C# 
code with MonoTouch tomorrow or port it again. This is a free app (as 
in, a favour to my friend and I'm not charging them for it), likely with 
a banner ad. It isn't going to make any app store revenue and the &quot;ad&quot; 
revenue is still unproven to me. I'm not going to spend another $200+ on 
MonoTouch when I could just bite the bullet and do it in 
Obj-C/CocoaTouch (and probably just should as I was being lazy waiting 
to see the MonoTouch pricing and deadlines are arriving quickly.)

I'm wasting my breath though, as I suspect the pricing is set in stone. 
I only hope it is reasonable! Don't forget the &quot;little man&quot; guys, we are 
not made of money, and MonoTouch is extremely exciting to us us we can 
leverage our libraries in C# without needing to completely recode them. ;-)

</I>&gt;<i> As far as I can see for the foreseeable future anybody that develops 
</I>&gt;<i> for the iPhone platform **will** learn Objective-C, whether they want 
</I>&gt;<i> to or not. Either that or write the same three apps forever.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If they don&#8217;t they&#8217;ll be at the very least cut off from code samples, 
</I>&gt;<i> explanations etc. - including all of the Apple documentation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I just don&#8217;t see that as practical.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It might be in time if a lot of C# developers take up MonoTouch (apart 
</I>&gt;<i> from anything else, I suspect it will attract a lot of current .NETCF 
</I>&gt;<i> developers), but the documentation issue will always be there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The effect this has on the pricing question is that it needs to be 
</I>&gt;<i> very finely balanced &#8211; if MonoTouch is too expensive from the 
</I>&gt;<i> developer&#8217;s perspective then they&#8217;ll choose good enough over better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We also have to remember the pencil-thin margins on iPhone 
</I>&gt;<i> applications &#8211; it would be nice to at least have a reasonable chance 
</I>&gt;<i> of recovering your investment before the Moon escapes out into deep 
</I>&gt;<i> space...
