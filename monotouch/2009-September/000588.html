<PRE>Ok now that we're mostly derailed from monotouch goodness, please delete here if you don't care about XNA.

I'm all for simple games and small teams without million dollar budgets.  One of my favorite games is Peggle (2d only) and I'm not ashamed of that :).

But having features post year 2002 can do a lot to help these types also - Just because you want to use Shader 4.0 doesn't mean you require a million dollar budget.  In fact it's the opposite because newer shaders have less restrictions and are easier to code.

If people don't need it by all means don't use it - but why should we not have access to new features as an option at least?

I totally agree. Often people pick a superior platform for the wrong reasons because they feel limited in some way but then build a simple 2D game.

XNA on MonoTouch just adds another platform available to people wanting to write simple games. Which I would argue most of the iPhone games are simplistic.

Like yourself I don't know how bad/good XNA is but it seems to be emerging as a cross platform SDK, at least for basic games and not something that requires an insane engine.

Just look at the excitement of the XNA on MonoTouch &quot;possibility&quot; occurred on Twitter last night.

That's my 2 cents ;)

I think the value of XNA isn't for the top notch high end games, but rather for smaller games where DX9 etc is more than sufficent, and its made by a smaller team, or hobbyist. I don't know anything about the community , and not much about the platform whether it really sucks or is the easiest quickest game dev framework since sliced bread. To me i see the value is that a small team  can make an app that runs on PC and XBOX with an XBOX distribution mechanism that doesn't cost tens of thousands of dollars, and the 2nd benefit is &quot;run anywherish&quot; when you see things running on silverlight in the browser, ZUNE, and possibly monotouch. Its an economy of scale value for hobbyist/casual games.

Jose,

I stand corrected - I was thinking of MDX which is deprecated and is the predecessor to XNA.  You also make a good point about the community around XNA which is a huge factor for any codebase.

But still I'm a little bitter that XNA has not only no DX10/11 features, but Microsoft will not even speak about a future roadmap for XNA that includes such features.

Yes DX9 is still capable, but think about how fast graphics features evolve - DX9 first came out in 2002.

The reality seems to be XNA is artificially stuck at DX9 level functionality until Xbox Gen3.

Lee

Hi Lee,

1) Thanks...just for fun!

2) No man! XNA it's great...have a LOT of tutorials, resources and
samples available! I think the XNA model is the best for game
development. It's easy, powerfull and very popular. XNA deprecated??
Well...really...i think you need learn more about XNA Platform.

Best,

Jose

</I>&gt;<i> A recent email to the MonoTouch list indicated that the
</I>&gt;<i> recently-announced XnaTouch project was created by using Reflector to
</I>&gt;<i> decompile Microsoft's XNA assemblies. This is in violation of Mono's

</I>&gt;<i> tainted and unable to contribute to a clean implementation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is unfortunate, as we are very excited by the possibility of
