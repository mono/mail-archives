<PRE>I hear you. I'd be one of the ones who are like &quot;just let me pay you money
so i can publish on the appstore already&quot;. But I also am aware of the
backlash of paying &quot;traditional&quot; customers who would be like &quot;I paid money
for a RTM software and the docs aren't complete, and there was X , Y and Z
bug that really aren't forgivable in a RTM product of this category, and the
&quot;I build my app, published it, and the next time an official release build
came out, my app won't compile, or crashes against it and it took me 2 weeks
to update my app, yada yada&quot;. I know that certian graces afforded to
OpenSource projects aren't there with many paying customers, and peripheral
tools and software have less stringent expectations than something as &quot;Core&quot;
as monotouch.
