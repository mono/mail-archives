<PRE>After looking at the pricing structure for MonoTouch I would have to agree
with everyone else, at this price point you will have a very hard time
selling this to anyone but businesses.
I know I will never be able to justify $400 to my wife.

I've been working professionally as a programmer for nearly 20 years and
I've rarely seen businesses that pay for Enterprise licenses, much less an
&quot;Enterprise&quot; license that is only good for one Developer.  There will be
tons of license abuse at this price point within businesses. Heck, most of
the places I have worked at outfit their Developers with Visual Studio they
got from one copy of the MSDN. I really don't see those types of businesses
shelling out $1,000 per developer for MonoTouch.

As everyone else has pointed out, the price for the &quot;Personal&quot; Edition
completely excludes hobbyist and Open Source Development which is a very sad
shame, especially since Mono and MonoDevelop were built by people that live
by the Open Source Freedom Philosophy.

I appreciate all the hard work from the Mono, MonoDevelop and the MonoTouch
Teams but at this price point I will just have to brush up on Objective-C.

For now, I would consider myself a hobbyist in regards to iPhone
Development.  Like all of us here, I would love to put an Application into
the App Store for the iPhone but with a full-time job and a family with
young children, I just can not justify paying $400 for a code library for
hobbyist programmer work when there are so many much more justifiable
expenditures for the family.

Let's remember that a vast number of the big success stories from the iPhone
App Store come from hobbyists programmers.

At this price point all I can say is good luck and thanks for a great beta.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MonoTouch Enterprise Edition:  $999/Developer
</I>&gt;<i> A MonoTouch Enterprise Edition license is owned by a legal entity for use
</I>&gt;<i> by one developer at any given time, entitles the owner to one year of
</I>&gt;<i> MonoTouch updates, and allows enterprise deployments of MonoTouch

</I>&gt;<i> MonoTouch on Apple's App Store.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The MonoTouch Enterprise Edition will also be offered as a 5-Developer
</I>&gt;<i> License at $3,999 (a 20% discount).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please let me know if you have any questions about pricing, or about the
