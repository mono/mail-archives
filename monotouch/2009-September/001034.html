Hi Geoff,
In FinishedLaunching(), I am:
1. Loading &amp; checking some user prefs (3 strings) via
NSUserDefaults.StandardUserDefaults
2. Setting UIApplication.SharedApplication.NetworkActivityIndicatorVisible
= true
3. Creating and adding a very simple UIImageView to the window (a
&quot;loading data...&quot; type of image)
4. Firing off an asynchronous HttpWebRequest to a REST service
5. When the request completes, the callback delegate uses
InvokeOnMainThread() to call a method that creates the various
UIViewControllers in my MainWindow.xib's UITabBarController tabs (5 of
them, which are otherwise empty in the .xib - the UI for each tab is
created lazily in each controller's ViewDidLoad())

Now, I'm thinking that steps 1-3 shouldn't affect startup to the
extent that the app is killed off - not much work is being done there.
With the request, I'm operating under the assumption that the
asynchronous nature of the call should let the app/UI continue
loading.

When the app does run successfully - which is 95% of the time -
everything behaves as expected - app is launched, eventually the
network activity indicator starts &amp; the UIImageView appears, the HTTP
request is triggered, and on callback the main UI is displayed.

However, when it fails, it doesn't seem to even get as far as step 2 -
the network activity indicator never appears.

It should probably be noted that this only seems to happen in the
following situations:
1. The first run of a freshly-deployed build of the app
2. The app hasn't been run for a while

When I get some time, I'm going to add some Console.WriteLines at each
step, to see if I can find out more about where the slowdown is.

If I'm doing anything wrong in my initialisation code, please let me know.

Mark
