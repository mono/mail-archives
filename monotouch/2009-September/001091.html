</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> then MonoDevelop would show tool tips (shown as comments) - or a side
</I>&gt;<i> window, whatever - whenever I mouse over or press a key.
</I>&gt;<i> So I have the problem of adding a plugin to MonoDevelop and creating a tool

</I>&gt;<i> Is this remotely possible? Can you point to where I should start looking for

Developing addins is certainly possible. Check out

Regarding profiling, there's a MD profiling addin in SVN though was
never quite finished and has bitrotted a bit, but it might be good
starting point, as it was designed to allow different profilers to be
plugged in.

Please ask on the monodevelop-devel mailing list or in the
#monodevelop IRC channel  if you have any questions about writing MD
addins.

I'm not sure how well the Mono profiler works on Mac, but I'm pretty
sure it should be possible to get it working for the simulator at some
point. I don't know about the device - integrating to the Xcode perf
tools may be necessary for that.
