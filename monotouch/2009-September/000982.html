mscorlib.dll is MIT/X11, and thus isn't a problem.

The problem is libmono, which is LGPL licensed, and includes the GC and
various data structures used at runtime (Reflection, file I/O, etc.).

I don't think so.  According to:

        <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/projects/dotgnu/pnet.html">http://www.gnu.org/projects/dotgnu/pnet.html</A>

The licensing is:

        The 'ilrun' runtime engine is made available under the terms of
        the GNU General Public License (GPL), the 'pnetlib' class
        library under the terms of the GPL with a &quot;linking exception&quot;...

So the exclusion clause you refer to is for the class libraries
(mscorlib.dll, System.dll, etc.), NOT for the runtime itself (JIT, GC,
associated data structures, etc.).

Their runtime license is even more restrictive than Mono's (GPL vs.
LGPL), but for the iPhone that doesn't matter: all libraries MUST be
statically linked, so even the &quot;free-er&quot; LGPL doesn't help here (as the
end user has no way to re-link the executable, much less deploy the
relinked executable to their iPhone).

Thus, unless I'm completely misreading their web pages, DotGnu is no
solution.  The only other alternative would be to completely
re-implement the libmono pieces as e.g. MIT/X11 code, which would be a
large amount of work.

&gt;<i> By &quot;complying with the LGPL&quot; - surely, the LGPL implies that the end 
</I>&gt;<i> user should be able to gain the elements of the source code covered by 
</I>&gt;<i> the LGPL in a binary form that will link together to form the executable 
</I>&gt;<i> using the tools for the appropriate platform to comply? Am I correct? 
</I>
Correct.  And as mentioned above, this does no good on the iPhone.  Even
if you said (as an App developer) &quot;here are my object files, please
re-link them against a newer LGPL mono &amp; deploy,&quot; the user COULD NOT
deploy the updated app to their device (unless they had a code signing
certificate from Apple, i.e they're already an iPhone developer).  As
most people won't be iPhone developers, this will never be possible,
realistically.

&gt;<i> I guess many of us have never really thought about the Mono licensing 
</I>&gt;<i> before, as the static linking and native code is a bit of an edge case. 
</I>&gt;<i> Kind of more draconian than I imagined.
</I>
Blame Apple.  If Apple didn't have the static linking requirement, then
static linking could be avoided and a commercial Mono license wouldn't
be necessary.  But Apple did, so a commercial license is necessary.
