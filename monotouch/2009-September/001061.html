<PRE>Unfortunately the industry has a ton of SOAP services out there currently. It is a desirable feature to have SOAP capabilities. Whether you're against the makeup of SOAP and the companies involved is sometimes irrelevant to the requirements.

Although I agree SOAP is not ideal in many cases, but sometimes it is also a time saver if the extra bloat of the XML isn't really an issue (which is most cases). Tooling for SOAP web services is much stronger than REST as .NET requires almost no code to interface with the web service. 

Not to mention some large services expose via SOAP such as Sales Force. However they may have a REST interface now, they did not when I last used them.

Thanks and take care,
Simon

Subject: Re: [MonoTouch] best way currently to call a web service?

Don't use SOAP/WS-* protocols - they're an un-necessary technology
designed to give MS/IBM/HP/etc an excuse to charge huge consulting
fees.
It performs slower, is less interoperable and generally requires the
overhead of a SOAP framework + generated code etc.

I would recommend either REST+POX (Plain old XML) or REST+JSON for web services.
Anyone considering whether or not to use REST should read this
article, it explains it quite well:
<A HREF="http://tomayko.com/writings/rest-to-my-wife">http://tomayko.com/writings/rest-to-my-wife</A>

XML is the most interoperable language, and works best (and performs
better) between 2 .NET endpoints (like MonoTouch =&gt; Mono Web Service).

JSON is slower to deserialize, in .NET but is smaller in size and
performs better inside a website, so I would recommend it over XML for
Ajax sites.

Essentially you just need to send DataContract's over the wire to a
HttpHandler endpoint and use either DataContractSerializer (for XML)
or JsonDataContractSerializer (for JSON) to deserialize the request

I've done a lot of work in this area with my open source webservices
stack which currently works in mono and takes most of the effort out
of building web services and automatically provides REST+JSON and
REST+XML endpoints:
<A HREF="http://www.servicestack.net">http://www.servicestack.net</A>
source code is available here: <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/servicestack">http://code.google.com/p/servicestack</A>

I haven't yet tested it in MonoTouch yet as I haven't dual-booted into
OSX for a few weeks so I think I've missed the BETA.
Will probably have to wait till they release the evaluation version
before I can verify that it works.
