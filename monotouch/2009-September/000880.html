<PRE>personally i'm fine paying $399 even though i'd rather not. The main thing
is that i have access to the tools BEFORE i have to pay. I typically have a
number of projects going on, and will use third party components to help
them get going.. 8 or of 10 projects i nix along time before they get
anywhere finished. (maybe i loose interest, they seem too much effort, or my
market research shows its not worth it). And so those projects die. I just
used a trial version of a component, and i don't purchase.

HOWEVER, for those 2 out of 10, suddenly i've put a good number of hours
into them, have a plan, and are going to release them (whether commercial or
freeware), and thats the point that i'm willing to pay the $399. I've burnt
myself too many times before buying a library with all good intentions to
use it and never getting around to it other than just some playing.

And i think that most people here complaining, would even begrudgingly , put
out the $399 once they had a completed app ready to submit to the appstore.

plus also value wise, there have been few libraries that i've used that
haven't saved me SOOO much time and dollars not having to reinvent the
wheel. With developer salaries being at least $50 an hour. If monotouch
saves you just 8 hours over obj-C then its worth it.

My biggest fear with monotouch, is that because its so foundational, and
potentially so huge, its a risk factor if i invest in building a large code
base in monotouch, and there are just issues after issues, and its not
updated enough, and breaks with future SDK updates etc. The fear of it
becoming the ugly step sister. (i loved delphi, and its huge community in
the day, but hated having to transcribe and hack C headers over all the time
from the MS SDKs to do anything OS'sy - BORLAND KYLIX that somebody
mentioned is exactly my point here. I was excited about that, but thankfully
didn't have the time, or need to jump on that bandwagon, so suffered no
pain)

However given that iphone projects are typically of a smaller scale i don't
have that fear with monotouch.

There are some areas i wouldn't dare venture into with monotouch (i.e my
streaming radio playing app), and even there obj-C wasn't bare boned enough
to pull that job off alone, but i also am investing time into learning
OBJ-C, not just because i'm a language nerd, but because i want to &quot;get&quot; the
apple mindset, since it will help me all around, even if i have to put up
with watching annoying condescending apple training videos where they talk
far too slow and talk to you like you are not a developer but a graphics
designer or something.
