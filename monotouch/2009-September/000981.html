By &quot;runtime&quot; do you mean &quot;mscorlib.dll&quot; and such, or is it more than 
that? I wonder if the DotGnu stuff might be used as a basis - the 
library has a specific exclusion clause that would seem to allow for 
static linking. Not that I'm implying that I would go this route, just 
that it might be possible.

By &quot;complying with the LGPL&quot; - surely, the LGPL implies that the end 
user should be able to gain the elements of the source code covered by 
the LGPL in a binary form that will link together to form the executable 
using the tools for the appropriate platform to comply? Am I correct? 
Again, I'm playing Devil's advocate - it isn't something I'd be looking 
any further in to.

I guess many of us have never really thought about the Mono licensing 
before, as the static linking and native code is a bit of an edge case. 
Kind of more draconian than I imagined.
