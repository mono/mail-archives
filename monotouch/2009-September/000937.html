<PRE>David has a very good point and one you would think Miguel would appreciate,
being from Mexico. He of all people should know that Developers in his home
country don't get paid enough to afford MonoTouch which is probably why he
lives in the United States.
My brother-in-law is a Software Architect working for an American Company in
Mexico. They pay him only $15,000 U.S. Dollars a Year and he is not only an
Architect but in charge of a large Team of Developers.

His company would never pay $400 for such a license, led alone $1,000 for an
Enterprise/Developer Time Share License.

As you can imagine, on a salary of $15,000 USD (before Taxes) with a family
of 4, my brother-in-law has to do several side jobs to make ends meat.  He
was counting on MonoTouch to usher him into iPhone Application Development
but at a price of $400 USD, he will definitely have to pass.

When I look at Microsoft, I think greed... greed for Money, greed for Power.

When I look at Novel and the way they have fostered the development of SUSE
and it's FREE counterpart OpenSUSE and then MONO I see a business that
understands the difference between Enterprise Businesses, the Freedom of
OpenSource and Hobbyists together, but it would appear they have totally
missed the mark with this price point.

Is their any opportunity for an OpenMonoTouch?  Community Support Only
