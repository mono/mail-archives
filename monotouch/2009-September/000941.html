<PRE>Rebecca (and others) sorry for any confusion there.

My brother-in-law isn't paid an American Salary, I just converted his pesos
to USD for comparison.

The reason I mentioned Mexico is because of Miguel. He came from Mexico and
knows of the hardships his family and friends deal with there. He of all
people know that the current price point being touted by Novell is beyond
the reach of anyone in his country.

For anyone that is interested, many Mexicans do indeed &quot;own&quot; an iPhone. They
are all jailbroken as their isn't an official carrier there that I know of
but the Developers there all still want to develop for the iPhone even if it
is expensive there. Just as an aside, none of the Mexican side of my family
makes very much money but 4 of them have iPhones.

Based on the reactions we've seen here, I would hope that more thought will
go into the pricing structure before final release.

An OpenSource Licensed version would be nice.

Companies like Jetbrains offer FREE or low cost licenses for people that do
OpenSource Projects.

I believe Jetbrains are a little more particular... I think they need to see
that you have active projects going on within the typical OpenSource
communities (Github, CodePlex, Google Code, etc) and have a web site proving
you are actually active in the OpenSource Community.

Jetbrain's way of doing this is not bad but it does prohibit hobbyist
programmers from using their software.

I would like to see something in the way of an OpenSource or Hobbyist
license.  Maybe requiring that any and all applications deployed with such a
license must utilize a GPL, LGPL or any other such license. Heck, I would
even be okay with a requirement to host my iPhone App Code on Github or
somewhere for anyone to see to get a FREE or cheaper license.  Giving out
your source code doesn't mean you can't make money off your apps.

At the current price point MonoTouch will whither away into obscurity when
it comes to hobbyists and OpenSource Developers. Just take a poll any day of
the week in the OpenSource/Free Software Community and you will find they
all use Java, Python, Ruby and pretty much anything they don't have to pay
for. Large Businesses and those with deep pockets will buy MonoTouch but
people in the OpenSource Community and hobbyists such as myself who is also
a parent and just enjoys writing apps for fun will have to just go the
Objective-C route.

</I>&gt;<i> David has a very good point and one you would think Miguel would appreciate, being from Mexico. He of all people should know that Developers in his home country don't get paid enough to afford MonoTouch which is probably why he lives in the United States.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My brother-in-law is a Software Architect working for an American Company in Mexico. They pay him only $15,000 U.S. Dollars a Year and he is not only an Architect but in charge of a large Team of Developers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> His company would never pay $400 for such a license, led alone $1,000 for an Enterprise/Developer Time Share
</I>&gt;<i>  License.
