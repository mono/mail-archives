<PRE>Hi Geoff - here's the test results on my iPhone 3G, achieved using  
Console.WriteLine(DateTime.Now.Ticks), and grabbing the output via  
Xcode's &quot;Organizer&quot; app. Note: this was a successful app launch - it  
wasn't killed off by the iPhone OS.

Main() entry to FinishedLaunching() entry: 1.40 seconds
Loading user defaults: 0.03 seconds
Setting  
UIApplication.SharedApplication.NetworkActivityIndicatorVisible: 0.03  
seconds
Create &amp; add UIImageView: 0.48 seconds
Build and begin async HTTP request: 0.98 seconds (there's a bit of XML  
being built here)
Total time from UIApplication.Main() entry to main UI appearing:  
approx 3.60 seconds. This seems reasonable - the results here weren't  
too surprising, although the 1.4 seconds between Main() entry and  
FinishedLaunching() entry seems rather long - what's happening in the  
runtime between these two methods?

However, what seems problematic to me is the time that elapses between  
app launch, and the first Console.Write in the app's Main() method.  
Obviously I can't really time this from code, but using a stopwatch  
gives about 9 seconds... This testing seems to confirm what I noticed  
when comparing the launch times of the ObjC UICatalog app, and the  
MonoTouch port - most of the time seems to elapse before user code is  
entered in the Main() method.

It's great you're going to devote development time to optimising app  
launch - but I'd love to understand more about what's going on under  
the bonnet (sorry, hood...) during this phase - the runtime startup &amp;  
registration you mentioned earlier. Can you post a bit of info about  
this to the list? I'm sure others would find this interesting as well...

How much would --nolink/--linksdkonly affect launch times of apps  
built using these flags? Given the larger binary blobs, would this  
drastically slow down launch times?

Thanks,
Mark

P.S. I should probably note that once MonoTouch apps are up &amp; running,  
they seem to be just as responsive as ObcC apps - top work!
