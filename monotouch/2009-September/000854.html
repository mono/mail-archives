<PRE>We'll I'm going to echo the existing sentiment, I think the cost for
the personal edition has priced out hobby developers, something which
the iPhone has a lot of.

The cost is fine for Enterprise and professional developers who make
their income from the AppStore, but hobby developers aren't likely to
get any ROI.

Although in its current immature form, the lack of documentation,
community, etc, means you will still need to know objective-c in order
to be able to read the current support.

Have we thought about a yearly subscription / beta price to kick-start
the community?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hello all
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We're not making an official announcement regarding pricing and release
</I>&gt;<i> dates, yet; however, we now have pricing established internally, and the team
</I>&gt;<i> wanted to share this information since there have been a lot of people
</I>&gt;<i> anxiously inquiring.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Novell currently expects to launch MonoTouch next week. &#160;Two editions will be
</I>&gt;<i> available:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MonoTouch Personal Edition: &#160;$399/Developer A MonoTouch Personal Edition
</I>&gt;<i> license is owned by an individual. &#160;The license is non-transferrable,
</I>&gt;<i> entitles the owner to one year of MonoTouch updates, and allows distribution
</I>&gt;<i> of applications built with MonoTouch on Apple's App Store.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MonoTouch Enterprise Edition: &#160;$999/Developer A MonoTouch Enterprise Edition
</I>&gt;<i> license is owned by a legal entity for use by one developer at any given
</I>&gt;<i> time, entitles the owner to one year of MonoTouch updates, and allows
</I>&gt;<i> enterprise deployments of MonoTouch applications, as well as the distribution
</I>&gt;<i> of applications built with MonoTouch on Apple's App Store.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The MonoTouch Enterprise Edition will also be offered as a 5-Developer
</I>&gt;<i> License at $3,999 (a 20% discount).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please let me know if you have any questions about pricing, or about the
</I>&gt;<i> distinction between the two products.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for all of your help and feedback.
