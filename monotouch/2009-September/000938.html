<PRE>That doesn't make any sense.

First of all you're getting into world economics and regional pricing which is a separate conversation.  How can the same person afford $100-200 on Windows?  The answer is sometimes companies have regional pricing or sometimes people don't have a good option, but that's a debate for the entire industry not specific to MT.

Secondly even if you go down this path - most of the worlds professional software developers make $10/hour or more.  At this rate it doesn't take a huge boost in productivity to justify a week's salary.  Would I hate it?  Yes.  Would it make sense if I was 25% more productive?  No question.

Subject: Re: [MonoTouch] Pricing and Licensing

David has a very good point and one you would think Miguel would appreciate, being from Mexico. He of all people should know that Developers in his home country don't get paid enough to afford MonoTouch which is probably why he lives in the United States.

My brother-in-law is a Software Architect working for an American Company in Mexico. They pay him only $15,000 U.S. Dollars a Year and he is not only an Architect but in charge of a large Team of Developers.

His company would never pay $400 for such a license, led alone $1,000 for an Enterprise/Developer Time Share License.

As you can imagine, on a salary of $15,000 USD (before Taxes) with a family of 4, my brother-in-law has to do several side jobs to make ends meat.  He was counting on MonoTouch to usher him into iPhone Application Development but at a price of $400 USD, he will definitely have to pass.

When I look at Microsoft, I think greed... greed for Money, greed for Power.

When I look at Novel and the way they have fostered the development of SUSE and it's FREE counterpart OpenSUSE and then MONO I see a business that understands the difference between Enterprise Businesses, the Freedom of OpenSource and Hobbyists together, but it would appear they have totally missed the mark with this price point.

Is their any opportunity for an OpenMonoTouch?  Community Support Only

could afford $400 dollars for a single product when they earn an
average of $600 - $1000/month?
