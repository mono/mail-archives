<PRE>Hi,

I have to say that I also echo the previous feeling about the price, 
specially if you take in consideration that is a tool/sdk builded around 
other opensource projects and even if the dev guys says &quot;RC2&quot;, is still 
a beta quality products (just read the incoming mails about issues), is 
a shame and you have lots of guts to called a &quot;ready product&quot; specially 
at that target price...

I also kind of tired to read begs to novell to drop the price, we are 
all programmers and probably good ones, so we can leave novell with his 
plans and just learn Obj-C, or better yet begging our OpenTouch project 
and see what happen, in my opinion at this prices I really doubt that 1 
or 2 years from now we are still going to read anything about MT.

</I>&gt;<i> hobbyist and OpenSource Developers into account.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This beta has been filled with some great people.... I'm sure you all

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Rebecca (and others) sorry for any confusion there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     My brother-in-law isn't paid an American Salary, I just converted
</I>&gt;<i>     his pesos to USD for comparison.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The reason I mentioned Mexico is because of Miguel. He came from
</I>&gt;<i>     Mexico and knows of the hardships his family and friends deal with
</I>&gt;<i>     there. He of all people know that the current price point being
</I>&gt;<i>     touted by Novell is beyond the reach of anyone in his country.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     For anyone that is interested, many Mexicans do indeed &quot;own&quot; an
</I>&gt;<i>     iPhone. They are all jailbroken as their isn't an official carrier
</I>&gt;<i>     there that I know of but the Developers there all still want to
</I>&gt;<i>     develop for the iPhone even if it is expensive there. Just as an
</I>&gt;<i>     aside, none of the Mexican side of my family makes very much money
</I>&gt;<i>     but 4 of them have iPhones.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Based on the reactions we've seen here, I would hope that more
</I>&gt;<i>     thought will go into the pricing structure before final release.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     An OpenSource Licensed version would be nice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Companies like Jetbrains offer FREE or low cost licenses for
</I>&gt;<i>     people that do OpenSource Projects.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I believe Jetbrains are a little more particular... I think they
</I>&gt;<i>     need to see that you have active projects going on within the
</I>&gt;<i>     typical OpenSource communities (Github, CodePlex, Google Code,
</I>&gt;<i>     etc) and have a web site proving you are actually active in the
</I>&gt;<i>     OpenSource Community.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Jetbrain's way of doing this is not bad but it does prohibit
</I>&gt;<i>     hobbyist programmers from using their software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I would like to see something in the way of an OpenSource or
</I>&gt;<i>     Hobbyist license.  Maybe requiring that any and all applications
</I>&gt;<i>     deployed with such a license must utilize a GPL, LGPL or any other
</I>&gt;<i>     such license. Heck, I would even be okay with a requirement to
</I>&gt;<i>     host my iPhone App Code on Github or somewhere for anyone to see
</I>&gt;<i>     to get a FREE or cheaper license.  Giving out your source code
</I>&gt;<i>     doesn't mean you can't make money off your apps.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     At the current price point MonoTouch will whither away into
</I>&gt;<i>     obscurity when it comes to hobbyists and OpenSource Developers.
</I>&gt;<i>     Just take a poll any day of the week in the OpenSource/Free
</I>&gt;<i>     Software Community and you will find they all use Java, Python,
</I>&gt;<i>     Ruby and pretty much anything they don't have to pay for. Large
</I>&gt;<i>     Businesses and those with deep pockets will buy MonoTouch but
</I>&gt;<i>     people in the OpenSource Community and hobbyists such as myself
</I>&gt;<i>     who is also a parent and just enjoys writing apps for fun will
</I>&gt;<i>     have to just go the Objective-C route.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>     David has a very good point and one you would think Miguel would appreciate, being from Mexico. He of all people should know that Developers in his home country don't get paid enough to afford MonoTouch which is probably why he lives in the United States.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     My brother-in-law is a Software Architect working for an American Company in Mexico. They pay him only $15,000 U.S. Dollars a Year and he is not only an Architect but in charge of a large Team of Developers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     His company would never pay $400 for such a license, led alone $1,000 for an Enterprise/Developer Time Share
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      License.
