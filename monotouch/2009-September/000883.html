<PRE>I pretty much agree with most of what you said.

I'd just like to stress my own &quot;feeling&quot; that MT isn't a $400 product as of
yet.
I have no problem of trust in the MT team and Novell that they would
eventually make it a product worth much more
But I'm not sure if this will happen within a 12 month Time-Frame (which,
from what I gather is &quot;current&quot; proposed support period).

I would think that if Novell came up with a scheme where &quot;us&quot; beta testers
get a longer period of support (I dare say... prepetual-ish?)
I could justify this price to myself...

&gt;<i> personally i'm fine paying $399 even though i'd rather not. The main thing

</I>&gt;<i> used a trial version of a component, and i don't purchase.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> HOWEVER, for those 2 out of 10, suddenly i've put a good number of hours
</I>&gt;<i> into them, have a plan, and are going to release them (whether commercial or
</I>&gt;<i> freeware), and thats the point that i'm willing to pay the $399. I've burnt
</I>&gt;<i> myself too many times before buying a library with all good intentions to
</I>&gt;<i> use it and never getting around to it other than just some playing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And i think that most people here complaining, would even begrudgingly ,
</I>&gt;<i> put out the $399 once they had a completed app ready to submit to the
</I>&gt;<i> appstore.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> plus also value wise, there have been few libraries that i've used that
</I>&gt;<i> haven't saved me SOOO much time and dollars not having to reinvent the
</I>&gt;<i> wheel. With developer salaries being at least $50 an hour. If monotouch
</I>&gt;<i> saves you just 8 hours over obj-C then its worth it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My biggest fear with monotouch, is that because its so foundational, and
</I>&gt;<i> potentially so huge, its a risk factor if i invest in building a large code
</I>&gt;<i> base in monotouch, and there are just issues after issues, and its not
</I>&gt;<i> updated enough, and breaks with future SDK updates etc. The fear of it
</I>&gt;<i> becoming the ugly step sister. (i loved delphi, and its huge community in
</I>&gt;<i> the day, but hated having to transcribe and hack C headers over all the time
</I>&gt;<i> from the MS SDKs to do anything OS'sy - BORLAND KYLIX that somebody
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned is exactly my point here. I was excited about that, but thankfully
</I>&gt;<i> didn't have the time, or need to jump on that bandwagon, so suffered no
</I>&gt;<i> pain)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However given that iphone projects are typically of a smaller scale i don't
</I>&gt;<i> have that fear with monotouch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are some areas i wouldn't dare venture into with monotouch (i.e my
</I>&gt;<i> streaming radio playing app), and even there obj-C wasn't bare boned enough
</I>&gt;<i> to pull that job off alone, but i also am investing time into learning
</I>&gt;<i> OBJ-C, not just because i'm a language nerd, but because i want to &quot;get&quot; the
</I>&gt;<i> apple mindset, since it will help me all around, even if i have to put up
</I>&gt;<i> with watching annoying condescending apple training videos where they talk
</I>&gt;<i> far too slow and talk to you like you are not a developer but a graphics
</I>&gt;<i> designer or something.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> beta (illiad) was even worse though, as the WYWIG Qt editor didn't even
