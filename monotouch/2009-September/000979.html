Sandy, you are absolutely right.

Thanks for pointing out Joseph's response. I guess with the flurry of
complaints that were coming through I missed that.

As I pointed out in a previous message, Novell has done good by OpenSource
and Hobbyist Users/Developers in the past providing FREE Alternatives such
as OpenSuse.

Point taken very well Sandy, we should all stop complaining and wait to see
how this pans out.

If anything, this has been a great beta with some an extremely dedicated and
talented group of Developers on the MonoTouch Team.

Kudos for the release today. I wish you much success!

-Kevin

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sandy, yes, I'm reading the same mailing list and followed quite a bit
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; weekend as all the complaints came in about the price points unveiled
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Friday.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Of all the emails coming through I never saw anything from Miguel
</I>&gt;<i> mentioning
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the concerns being discussed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well look in the archives, this was all discussed before the prices
</I>&gt;<i> were even officially announced (thread called &quot;Commercial pricing?&quot;),
</I>&gt;<i> and Miguel responded at that time (Sept 8th):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;We might consider a Learning Edition, but right now it is a bit late to
</I>&gt;<i> do these changes as Monday is almost upon us, and that is our internal
</I>&gt;<i> agreed date for the final release (too many internal details have to be
</I>&gt;<i> sorted out for us to make that change).&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I understand that big corporations take time to work out pricing models
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that these prices were determined long before they were revealed to the
</I>&gt;<i> Beta
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Team. However, with that in mind, maybe Novell should have released the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; prices to the Beta Team much earlier so that they could have take our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; concerns to heart.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Giving the Beta Team the price list on Friday, seeing the flurry of
</I>&gt;<i> concern
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; over the weekend and yet releasing on Monday with the same prices just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't seem right.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If their was concern by the Mono/MonoTouch Team about the concern being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; discussed here then maybe they should address it.... here or on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MonoTouch web site.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Did you read Joseph's &quot;Pricing and Launch Update&quot; email?  The very
</I>&gt;<i> first paragraph said:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I would like to thank everyone for the feedback that you have provided,
</I>&gt;<i> and would like to let you know that we understand that you have some
</I>&gt;<i> very valid concerns.  We will be taking steps in the next weeks to address
</I>&gt;<i> many of these, some actions will take longer than others, but we definitely
</I>&gt;<i> want to do what we can today.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and later:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;You've given us some
</I>&gt;<i> great suggestions regarding limited versions and trials, which we've
</I>&gt;<i> already been considering, and we will make a determination about the
</I>&gt;<i> best solution for hobby developers in the very near future.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would think that encouraging words such as these from people who
</I>&gt;<i> have been very forthright in their communication with the beta testers
</I>&gt;<i> would help you to be a bit more patient.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can't help but feel that some people are spending a lot more time
</I>&gt;<i> complaining (repeating things that have already been said) and not
</I>&gt;<i> much time reading.
