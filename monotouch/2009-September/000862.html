This will not work, because to deploy on a phone would require a 
certificate to be issued by a developer for the specific device - this 
means that either Novell would require a developer account for every 100 
or so devices or some kind of special arrangement with Apple.

The other issue is - once we have compiler our code, the code sign is 
completely out of Novell's hands surely? It is done via Apple tool sets 
and anyone with a developer's licence could sign the code. It takes 5 
minutes to create and download a valid license for App store submission.

The simulator is an option - the simulator does not use ARM based 
compilation. A version of the monotouch that only creates x86 code would 
pretty much prevent Appstore submissions.

My question is - the code I compiled with the first Monotouch beta is 
still running on my iPhone - when will it stop working? I was lead to 
believe the beta was time limited in compilation terms - as in the code 
would expire and stop working.. is this not the case?
