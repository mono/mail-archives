<PRE>Hello all

We're not making an official announcement regarding pricing and release dates, yet; however, we now have pricing established internally, and the team wanted to share this information since there have been a lot of people anxiously inquiring.

Novell currently expects to launch MonoTouch next week.  Two editions will be available:

MonoTouch Personal Edition:  $399/Developer
A MonoTouch Personal Edition license is owned by an individual.  The license is non-transferrable, entitles the owner to one year of MonoTouch updates, and allows distribution of applications built with MonoTouch on Apple's App Store. 

MonoTouch Enterprise Edition:  $999/Developer
A MonoTouch Enterprise Edition license is owned by a legal entity for use by one developer at any given time, entitles the owner to one year of MonoTouch updates, and allows enterprise deployments of MonoTouch applications, as well as the distribution of applications built with MonoTouch on Apple's App Store.

The MonoTouch Enterprise Edition will also be offered as a 5-Developer License at $3,999 (a 20% discount).

Please let me know if you have any questions about pricing, or about the distinction between the two products.

Thanks for all of your help and feedback.

Joseph Hill
Product Manager for Mono
