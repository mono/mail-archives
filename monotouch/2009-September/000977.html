<PRE>Hello Mauricio,

&gt;<i> I have to say that I also echo the previous feeling about the price,
</I>&gt;<i> specially if you take in consideration that is a tool/sdk builded  
</I>&gt;<i> around
</I>&gt;<i> other opensource projects and even if the dev guys says &quot;RC2&quot;, is  
</I>&gt;<i> still
</I>&gt;<i> a beta quality products (just read the incoming mails about issues),  
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> a shame and you have lots of guts to called a &quot;ready product&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> specially
</I>&gt;<i> at that target price...
</I>
The price is for licensing Mono's runtime for static linking and the  
MonoTouch library for static linking, both required on the iPhone.

Usually the price for Mono's license for static linking is much  
higher, as we have historically only licensed that to large users.    
This is the first time that we make Mono's runtime available under non- 
LGPL terms to the public.

Although I sympathize with the idea that MonoTouch should have a  
number of extra features, and I understand that MonoDevelop's  
experience is not the same as Resharper or Visual Studio, we do not  
feel that it is in anyone's benefits to keep MonoTouch away from the  
public for years until MonoDevelop catches up to them.

This is a calculation that everyone needs to do: for some folks not  
having an IDE that is just like Resharper plus MonoTouch is not worth  
the price at this point.

&gt;<i> I also kind of tired to read begs to novell to drop the price, we are
</I>&gt;<i> all programmers and probably good ones, so we can leave novell with  
</I>&gt;<i> his
</I>&gt;<i> plans and just learn Obj-C, or better yet begging our OpenTouch  
</I>&gt;<i> project
</I>&gt;<i> and see what happen, in my opinion at this prices I really doubt  
</I>&gt;<i> that 1
</I>&gt;<i> or 2 years from now we are still going to read anything about MT.
</I>
An open source OpenTouch project would at this point require a Mono  
commercial license (as a distributor, you would have to comply with  
the LGPL, in particular section 6) or the creation of a new non- 
LGPL .NET runtime.

Miguel.
