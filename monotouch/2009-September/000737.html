<PRE>Greg,

 

Thank you for your reply.  However:

 

#1 - By calling &quot;window.AddSubView(myView.View)&quot;  would I not be adding the
relevant reference to the &quot;window&quot; so there is no need to keep the reference
myself?  I can see that &quot;myView&quot; might get GC'd, but not the view held inside
- does it matter to the iPhone that the view controller gets GC'd before the
view?  (This seems important since it's a &quot;hidden behaviour&quot; if I need to
reference parent objects that I'm no-longer using.

 

#2  Thank you - interesting (that code was code-generated by MonoDevelop).
Is there somewhere I can read to find out what you mean by &quot;registered with
the runtime&quot; means for me please?  I've done this since you recommend it, but
it doesn't actually seem to make any difference to the results of changing
#3.

 

#3 This seemed like my problem so I added a UIViewController to the main
window (by putting it on the XIB and calling
&quot;window.AddSubview(myViewController.View)&quot; in the &quot;FinishedLoading&quot; method as
described in the code-generated comments and then I call
&quot;myViewController.PresentModalViewController(myView, true)&quot; instead of
&quot;window.AddSubView(myView.View)&quot; and it started working.

 

HOWEVER...

 

If I add any direct reference to the View property before I call
PresentModalViewController - such as adding a Console.WriteLine (&quot;View :
&quot;+myView.View) - it stops working again.

 

So I contend that any programmatic access to a UIViewController's &quot;View&quot;
property before MonoTouch initializes the view causes the &quot;ViewDidLoad&quot;
function to never get called.  Does this analysis sound valid, or am I still
missing something blindingly obvious to experienced MonoTouch developers?

 

Many thanks again,

 

Mike

Mike,

 

  You have a few different bugs in your code:

 

#1: MyView will be GC'd since you dont keep a reference to it.

#2: The MyView default ctor doesn't call into the base chain, so its never
registered with the runtime, you want public MyView () : base (&quot;MyView&quot;,
null) {}

#3: You're adding the view to the mainwindow directly, short circuiting the
view controller, which is why the method is not raised on the view
controller.

Ok - click on the button on the form and ViewDidLoad does not fire in
&quot;MyView.xib.cs&quot;

 

Many thanks again in advance,

We need to see the entire project including xibs and code to tell you :D

Hi,

 

If I create a XIB in MonoDevelop and then add an override to &quot;ViewDidLoad&quot;
I'm getting inconsistent results as to whether it gets called or not -

 

Scenario 1 works :

 

LogonViewController lvc = new LogonViewController(); // where
LogonViewController is the name of my NIB

 

this.PushViewController(lvc, true); // Where current instance derives from
UINavigationController

 

Scenario 2 doesn't work:

 

LogonViewController lvc = new LogonViewController(); // where
LogonViewController is the name of my NIB

 

window.AddSubView(lvc.View); // window is the MainWindow.xib UIWindow object

 

In both cases the view appears, but in the 2nd I have no place to add button
delegates or images to the view.

 

User error or bug?

 

Many thanks,

 

Mike
