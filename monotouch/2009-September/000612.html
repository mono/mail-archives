<PRE>In another post, someone asked if it was appropriate to post links to the
list.  I don't know about the list masters, but my opinion is that as long
as the links are appropriate to the subject matter of the list, I would like
to see them.  If the list masters want to create a second list for those
things, I'm fine with that as well.  My view is that I want as much
monotouch material as I can get.  I want to know what people are doing and I
want to the exchange of information.  I'm a newb with monotouch and any
information is good information for me.  Of course, once someone sends
incorrect/inappropriate links, this will all change, but I need as much
monotouch info as possible.

 

Also, if you are unaware, check out <A HREF="http://monotouch.info/">http://monotouch.info/</A> for plenty of
information.
