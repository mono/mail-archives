<PRE>Before I say anything else, I have to say you cannot put a price on a piece
of art and good software is the ultimate form of art IMHO. MonoTouch is
something in the order of a miracle to me.
Now my criticism of the pricing:
To have an ongoing community of MonoTouch developers, it needs to be viable.
I had to go and buy a mac, then I have to pay a yearly $100 for my apple
license then a yearly $400 for MonoTouch and then how much do I earn? apart
from the odd $100 TomTom app, the expected price of an iPhone app is in the
order of $1 to a $5. I don't have any estimate on the volume of sales and
it's very widely different depending on your source. I have to invest my
time and learn the framework, fortunately I can now skip the ObjectiveC
torture, but can I justify all this? and for me as an Australian, everything
is even more expensive than you guys in US.

Cheers,
Ali
