<PRE>Hello,

Mono.XNA came back from the ashes around April/June this year. I am *very*
excited about XnaTouch and the renewed Mono.XNA activity - these projects
offer an opportunity to bring a large, indie gamedev community to
non-Windows platforms (and potentially create a new market for games on
Mono).

A few thoughts about places where Mono.XNA, XnaTouch and OpenTK can work
together (spoken from the viewpoint of OpenTK, since I happen to be the main
OpenTK developer :-) ):

1. A common math library. While it is not possible to use a separate, common
dll for math (would clash with the XNA ABI, different namespaces too), it
would be possible to move the math code into a common project and include it
into all three libraries (using svn externals to pull the code and
conditional compilation to take care of the different namespaces). The main
advantage is that bugfixes and optimizations (e.g. Mono.Simd) will help all
three projects directly. Moreover, this will reduce code duplication and
make it easier to port applications between the libraries.

2. A common abstraction layer for Mono.XNA and XnaTouch. Right now, Mono.XNA
is using Tao.OpenGL directly, while XnaTouch relies on OpenGL|ES. It should
be possible to design an abstraction that allows both projects to use a
common frontend for the XNA API but with different OpenGL/OpenGL|ES
backends.

3. Mono.XNA relies on Tao.SDL, which brings an unmanaged dependency - highly
undesirable from a portability standpoint. Starting with OpenTK 0.9.9-2 (to
be released shortly), OpenTK should be able to replace Tao.SDL with no loss
in functionality. Moreover, it provides a Tao compatibility layer that
supports Tao.OpenGL, meaning it should be able to replace Tao completely, if
desired. Again, more sharing and less duplication.

4. OpenTK was not designed for embedded devices originally. It is a
monolithic dll that depends on System.Xml, System.Diagnostics and other
namespaces that are not available on MonoTouch. Even worse, it triggers a
number of bugs in the mono linker, so it's not possible to use that to
reduce size. If OpenTK is to provide the low level 'glue' for XnaTouch and
Mono.XNA, these issues will have to be fixed. Jonathan has kindly donated a
set of patches that enable a 'minimal' OpenTK build for the iPhone, but a
complete solution will need more aggressive changes to the OpenTK internals.

5. It is not possible to provide 100% compatibility with XNA. Things are
slightly easier for XnaTouch/Zune (since the Zune doesn't support shaders,
IIRC), but this is outright impossible for Mono.XNA (since HLSL and GLSL are
fundamentally incompatible - there are HLSL algorithms that cannot be
expressed in GLSL directly). Rather, the goal should be to make ports
from/to XNA easy or even trivial.

I would *love* to see the three projects coordinate their development and
turn Mono into a primary gamedev platform ('primary' meaning outside of
'simple' scripting). On my part, I am willing to modify OpenTK as necessary
to improve platform support, reduce dependencies &amp; footprint and make it
suitable as a foundation for both XnaTouch and Mono.XNA. I will also donate
time and energy for the common math library, if that is found desirable.
Finally, I will help with any issues that come up while using OpenGL, OpenAL
and any OpenTK or Tao API.

Thoughts?

Cheers,
Stefanos

&gt;<i> Hi Chris,
</I>&gt;<i> The Mono.XNA project still alive?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> About the reflector, yes, i'm checking this right now with the owner of
</I>&gt;<i> SilverSprite project and the novell guys will check the source code too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> More new to come :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Jose.

</I>&gt;<i> Nice work though, it's a great way to show the power of the platform.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am very happy to announce the XnaTouch project (
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://xnatouch.codeplex.com/">http://xnatouch.codeplex.com/</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ).  your goal is translate the XNA framework to MonoTouch. The first
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> version is capable of run 2D games made for the Zune without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changes..it's great, but i need some help in audio and network stuff.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's pretty ugly yet, but  I think I can do the official launch at the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> end of the month and some help will be very welcome :)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MonoTouch rocks!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Jalf.
