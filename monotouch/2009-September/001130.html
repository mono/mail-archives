<PRE>Miguel,

I have thought about this as well however a standard iPhone application in MonoTouch is very much larger than its Objective-C counterpart and in danger of hitting the &quot;over the air downloadable&quot; limit of 10MB once you start adding images to your application. Much less head room.

I think probably some application statistics as far as real world apps compiling in both modes, how much gains are significant versus the amount of people encountering this issue.

If Novell wanted statistics on real world apps compiled in both modes, I for one would be glad to provide these on any production-size apps built so that we have numbers to base a decision around. I hope others would too so that we can better understand the situation.

I like your idea but I'm just not sure if the stats play in that favour or not.

There's a chance as people include large libraries like say MEF or others, that there is a large size of &quot;unused&quot; code the linker strips off. There is also the chance that a large amount of apps utilize 90% of their actual code and that your assumption would be correct.

It depends where the percentages lie I suppose is my point versus the risk.

Thanks and take care,
Simon

&gt;<i> b) you can add &quot;-linksdkonly&quot; (IIRC) to the additional mtouch options,
</I>&gt;<i> preventing the linker from removing anything from your code.
</I>
It seems to me that we should make this the default and developers
should opt-in to link everything on their own, if they want to reduce
the program size.

The reality is that the linker is mostly there to remove unnecessary
library code, not to remove your application's library code.

Thoughts?
