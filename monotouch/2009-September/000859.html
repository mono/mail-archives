Moreover, if you already have a Mac developer using Apple tools, the 
jump to iPhone development is far smaller if they use ObjectiveC.

The pull of MonoTouch was such that I hoped I would be able to justify 
the cost. But it now means that I, single named developer, would need to 
pay $498 this year to develop a free app? Um.. no. The $99 already to 
Apple is a better price for me - $129 - $199 (to Apple and Novell) would 
have been okay too. The AppStore development is subscription based, this 
price is too high for me. I guess it ends my interest in MonoTouch for 
the foreseeable future. The only way I could justify $399 was if it 
included a years subscription to iPhone development program also. Is it 
possible for Novell to provide such a service? That might dull the sting 
slightly.
