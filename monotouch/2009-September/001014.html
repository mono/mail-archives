<PRE>Geoff,

 

Just so that you know, this seems to work fine in RC2, so I presume something
got fixed. Thank you.

 

Regards,

 

Mike

Ok - click on the button on the form and ViewDidLoad does not fire in
&quot;MyView.xib.cs&quot;

 

Many thanks again in advance,

Hi,

 

If I create a XIB in MonoDevelop and then add an override to &quot;ViewDidLoad&quot;
I'm getting inconsistent results as to whether it gets called or not -

 

Scenario 1 works :

 

LogonViewController lvc = new LogonViewController(); // where
LogonViewController is the name of my NIB

 

this.PushViewController(lvc, true); // Where current instance derives from
UINavigationController

 

Scenario 2 doesn't work:

 

LogonViewController lvc = new LogonViewController(); // where
LogonViewController is the name of my NIB

 

window.AddSubView(lvc.View); // window is the MainWindow.xib UIWindow object

 

In both cases the view appears, but in the 2nd I have no place to add button
delegates or images to the view.

 

User error or bug?

 

Many thanks,

 

Mike
