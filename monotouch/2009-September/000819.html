<PRE>Hi!

I'm looking for somebody in Spain (or nearby country) that might be
interested in sharing their experiences with MonoTouch in a Code Camp we
are doing in October (<A HREF="http://www.codecamp.es">http://www.codecamp.es</A>). We are doing several
talks about Mono and MonoDevelop, and it would be great to have somebody
talk about writing iPhone apps with Mono.

We would pay the travel expenses, although budget is short, so we may
not be able to handle expensive flights. Talks are to be held in
spanish, although we could make an exception if there is a chance of a
good talk.

If you are interested, feel free to reply privately.
Thanks!
Lluis.

</PRE>
