<PRE>Hi,

Wow, quite the buzz around pricing.

As I mentioned before on another thread ideally a free (simulator only) version will be enabled at some point in order to stimulate a community around it (documentation and samples etc is something we can never have enough of :) ). As someone pointed out, the higher the price the less people will take it up (especially indie developers as they'll simply go the Objective-C route). Since a free version can't be offered right now I hope it does so soon after.

The rapid change during the beta has been great but people are still identify issues and there are others still waiting in the wings to trial the beta. Once it is priced and released expectations will be set and others will base their decision based on what they hear from those who purchased it soon after the release. If some people are pushing for a release could they have something similar to Microsoft's Go Live license?

That way you could utilise the rest of the month to get more beta versions out, invite the remaining people waiting to test it out (this will bring in a fresh set of eyes to investigate the beta) and get the education/free simulator version ready. This would give you the opportunity to take advantage of the buzz around the release to get as many people as possible to install MonoTouch and give it a try.

An affordable indie price would be good too :) (since you already have to buy a MacBook and pay Apple $99 if you are a typical .net developer).

Cheers,

John

</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nothing to do with price, but i think the monotouch
</I>&gt;<i> progress has been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; phenomenal but really its seems to be at early/mid
</I>&gt;<i> beta level, not RTM

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Although I agree, we are struggling on two sides: on one

</I>&gt;<i> the other the

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that our plan to sell MonoTouch with one year of
