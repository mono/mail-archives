<PRE>I agree that amount isn't good for a hobby developer (like me that write
iPhone apps for my own personal use).
I saw another product offer the possibility to develop an app but only run
it on your own device.. that's an idea for MonoTouch to help hobbies... you
can write the app but it will only run on your iPhone and you will not be
able to sell it on the AppStore. You can also limit the app.

Stats show that there's alot of developers that are downloading Visual
Studio.Net Express Edition simple because they're hobbies that can't afford
(or justify) the cost to buy the full VS.Net IDE.

What about a trail version? (30 days or whatever).

I guess this is a difficult topic, its always hard for a company to price a
product since you will make some customers happy / other unhappy. It all
depends on how you do it.
