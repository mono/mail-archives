<PRE>Dear Nic, can you give me your remarks to the following issues I have below:

1. Hosting database server in iOS

I've developed a Point of Sales (POS) app on the iPad and iPhone. The app
builds with local SQLite database. The app mainly operates in a single store
(close loop) environment with local network router. But in this environment
I need to be able to run several iPad(s) connecting together in a single
database. I want one iPad at the cashier counter to host the database and
the rest of other iPad devices connecting to the host. In the POS
environment, all app needs to be responsive in real-time or close to
real-time database access, because there a lot data transfers between them.
I think Core Data, web service, MS Azure, etc. is not going be responsive
enough. Nor having a local desktop Windows server to provide local data
access will NOT cut it because we want the store owner to be able to bring
the host iPad home after closing the shop. 

Questions: 1. Can I develop the app to host local database? 2. What is the
best network protocol for the host? Socket, REST, JASON, WCF

--------------------------------

2. Web Services Performance

Again, I've developed the Point of Sales (POS) application in Windows and
iPad (iOS devices) app using local database such as MSSQL Server Express and
Sqlite3. These applications work great and FAST in local network
environment. For multi stations I used MSSSQL network server (TCP open port
1433). For SQLite system, I've wrote a complete WCF server/client then
hosted on local network. Again, the systems work great and FAST. Now I want
explore Web base application which mean that I must hosting web services on
the WWW or Cloud services. 
  
 So, my question is what web service protocol should I use to maintaining
the satisfactory POS performance (the applications still have run locally as
native app). I have looks in to JSON, REST protocol but not sure will give
the performance that I need because in POS world it is requires that fast
and a lot database records to SELECT(GET), UPDATE(POST) and INSERT(PUT) in
real-time or close manner.
  
 I know that I can't get a real-time performance on web services but if I
can get 80% plus performance that worth shooting for. Thanks...
