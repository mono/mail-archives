<PRE>I'm considering buying MonoTouch to ease the port of a program of mine from
C# to the iPad/iPhone. I know that the GUI and events system will probably
have to be rewritten. Apart from that, I'm interested in how much more work
will be needed. With that in mind, I have created 12 choice questions to
help me decide. They're quite general, and should help many others including
myself.

1. How good is the string/character manipulation performance of MonoTouch in
comparison to Objective C? Is it almost as fast?

2. How good is the floating point math performance of MonoTouch in
comparison to Objective C?

3. My C# program is currently around 500k in filesize. How much would this
translate to once it's ported with MonoTouch?

4. How much of the code would I need to change when using MonoTouch? Apart
from GUI stuff, I'm hoping very little. For example, if I have lines like
these (unrelated):

    -  CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.TextInfo.ListSeparator

    -  text.Split(new string[] { &quot;TEST&quot; },
StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);

    -  Convert.ToDouble(myVar, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture)

    -  (measure)Enum.Parse(typeof(measure), myVar)

    -  Array.Resize(ref ops, i)

    ....could I use those pieces of code directly, or would they need
adjusting for MonoTouch?

5. I use the TimeSpan and DateTime classes. Are these fully supported with
MonoTouch?

6. How thorough is the Globalization library and CultureInfo class support?
Will MonoTouch recognize the decimal point character etc.?

7. How is the File class used? Are disc access MonoTouch functions
equivalent to their pure C# counterparts? How about a piece of code such as
`Application.StartupPath`?

8. In C#, the RichTextBox supports Rtf as input. Will MonoTouch allow me to
use an equivalent GUI widget which allows Rtf input?

9. How about HttpWebRequest, WebRequest, and GlobalProxySelection for
reading a file from the web?

10. Is threading supported well, including the background worker system?

11. Are dictionaries fully supported?

12. And finally, with Monotouch, can I mix C# and objective C code if I
wanted to? Or does it all have to be C#?
