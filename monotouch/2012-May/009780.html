<PRE>Hi Stuart,

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - get all projects to run in wp7, winrt and monodroid from the PC
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - get MonoTouch/MonoDevelop on the Mac to load Portable Library Project
</I>&gt;<i> files - but this seems only to work if I force the Profile type to
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Profile1&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - get MonoTouch projects to use Portable Class Libraries if I add them as
</I>&gt;<i> compiled references rather than as project references.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, there are still a few gaps I'm trying to fill - all of them on
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop on the Mac:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. I don't seem to be able to find any way to load PLPs project files in
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop outside of Profile1 - if the .csproj file contains anything
</I>&gt;<i> other than Profile1 in
</I>&gt;<i> `&lt;TargetProfileFramework&gt;Profile1&lt;/TargetProfileFramework&gt;` then it won't
</I>&gt;<i> load.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hmm, this seems like a bug. I'll look into this. Could you submit a bug
report to <A HREF="http://bugzilla.xamarin.com">http://bugzilla.xamarin.com</A> for tracking? The &quot;IPhone Add-In&quot;
component is a good place to submit these (that should auto-assign the bugs
to me).


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. I can't work out how to edit the installed profiles. Ideally I'd like to
</I>&gt;<i> go even further than Profile 4 - ideally I'd like to extend this all the
</I>&gt;<i> way
</I>&gt;<i> up to Profile 104 as I can then link in my own type
</I>&gt;<i> redirection/substitution
</I>&gt;<i> stubs for the limited required System.Net and System.Windows assemblies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
There's currently no editor UI for this because we currently do not have
any of the XML files that define the profiles, so the only way to have done
it would have been to hard-code the profile names and relations.

We want to eventually have full support for .NETPortable projects and be
compatible with Microsoft, but we do not currently have the XML / API
definitions for the profiles as part of Mono. It *is* in our queue to
figure out how to generate these, because long-term we agree that this is
the way forward.

Once we find a way to include those in Mono, it'll become a high priority
to implement a UI for selecting these profile configurations.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. I can't work out how to reference portable library projects from
</I>&gt;<i> MonoTouch projects - I can add the references, but as soon as I select a
</I>&gt;<i> configuration like &quot;Debug|iPhoneSimulator&quot; then the PLP is greyed out and
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;not build in active configuration&quot; appears.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
What configurations does it work with? I could have sworn this worked.

Could you submit a bug for this one, too?

I'll look into this one as well.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I appreciate that much of what I'm trying here is on the edge of what has
</I>&gt;<i> currently been tried, and I realise that some of the features I'm trying to
</I>&gt;<i> use are only available in Beta from Microsoft, but I really strongly
</I>&gt;<i> believe
</I>&gt;<i> in this as the way forwards - so that's why I'm trying so hard to get it
</I>&gt;<i> working :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
We think it's the way forward, too.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Has anyone got any ideas about what I could try to move this forwards? I am
</I>&gt;<i> toying with the monodevelop source code right now, but haven't really
</I>&gt;<i> gotten
</I>&gt;<i> very far into it yet. If anyone has any ideas or suggestions I'd love to
</I>&gt;<i> hear them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The easiest way to poke around the .NETPortable stuff is probably to use
`git log --author=jeff` and then search for .NETPortable (it's how I remind
myself where the source files are!)

For example, one of the source files
is: main/src/core/MonoDevelop.Core/MonoDevelop.Projects/PortableDotNetProject.cs


Hope that helps,

Jeff
