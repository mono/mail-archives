<PRE>I gotta say, please review your QA procedures.  Watching
monodevelop/monotouch strip out actions from an existing IB (mutilate
existing source modules, in other words), or fail to import changes is just
ridiculous for a &quot;professional grade&quot; product.

This is exactly the type of stuff that gives &quot;open source&quot; or &quot;loose source&quot;
a bad name.  This (Monotouch) isn't supposed to be some open source, freebie
thing - it's &quot;supposed&quot; to be a professional-grade paid-for development
suite.  Why am I dealing with newbie developer issues then?

I mean, really, come on - do you need someone who can say it straight to
speak up?  Well, here it is - monodevelop intellisense is still a joke,
mutilating existing xib's is ridiculous.  Stop charging for this stuff if it
isn't at least backed by competent developers.

Plz, let the hate mail flow, I'm seriously a bit peeved about this - as any
customer should be.  If you (Xamarin) were a veterinarian, I'd be
complaining that you just killed my dog.  Get some talent behind this, put
in place some professional grade QA, and stop releasing stuff that actually
harms your customers... aight?  After a year and a half of tireless effort,
I have to kill monodevelop and restart it just to make sure.. I hope... that
it will recognize IB changes is... well, I already said it - ridiculous.

Yeah, yeah, let the &quot;I don't use IB because I'm so uber&quot; hate mail start...
whatever, just make the stuff work or stop charging.
