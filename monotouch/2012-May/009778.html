<PRE>Hi All

I'm still plugging away at trying to get Portable Library projects to work
fully across wp7, winrt, droid and touch.

I'm especially trying this as it will deliver lots of benefits in terms of
refactoring and csproj project management to me as a cross platform
developer.

I've previously managed to:

- get all projects to build in VS2010 - using VSMonoTouch with a fair amount
of hacking -
<A HREF="http://slodge.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/using-portable-library-tools-for.html">http://slodge.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/using-portable-library-tools-for.html</A>

- get all projects to run in wp7, winrt and monodroid from the PC

- get MonoTouch/MonoDevelop on the Mac to load Portable Library Project
files - but this seems only to work if I force the Profile type to
&quot;Profile1&quot;

- get MonoTouch projects to use Portable Class Libraries if I add them as
compiled references rather than as project references.

However, there are still a few gaps I'm trying to fill - all of them on
MonoDevelop on the Mac:

1. I don't seem to be able to find any way to load PLPs project files in
MonoDevelop outside of Profile1 - if the .csproj file contains anything
other than Profile1 in
`&lt;TargetProfileFramework&gt;Profile1&lt;/TargetProfileFramework&gt;` then it won't
load. 

2. I can't work out how to edit the installed profiles. Ideally I'd like to
go even further than Profile 4 - ideally I'd like to extend this all the way
up to Profile 104 as I can then link in my own type redirection/substitution
stubs for the limited required System.Net and System.Windows assemblies.

3. I can't work out how to reference portable library projects from
MonoTouch projects - I can add the references, but as soon as I select a
configuration like &quot;Debug|iPhoneSimulator&quot; then the PLP is greyed out and
&quot;not build in active configuration&quot; appears.

I appreciate that much of what I'm trying here is on the edge of what has
currently been tried, and I realise that some of the features I'm trying to
use are only available in Beta from Microsoft, but I really strongly believe
in this as the way forwards - so that's why I'm trying so hard to get it
working :)

Has anyone got any ideas about what I could try to move this forwards? I am
toying with the monodevelop source code right now, but haven't really gotten
very far into it yet. If anyone has any ideas or suggestions I'd love to
hear them.

Thanks - and sorry for such a long post on a Friday!

Stuart
