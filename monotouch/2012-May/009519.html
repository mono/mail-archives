</I> From what I can understand...

The information from UIImagePicker is returned in a a NSMutableDictionary.  The keys are NSStrings, the valid values of which are conveniently provided as static on the UIImagePicker class. The value that is returned from the collection when you use the MediaType NS string as a key is another string that is one of the values of UTType (<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/MobileCoreServices/Reference/UTTypeRef/Reference/reference.html">http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/MobileCoreServices/Reference/UTTypeRef/Reference/reference.html</A>). Obviously this is likely constrained to be image video etc... I was confused that while the &quot;MediaType&quot; NSString constant isprovided, I could not find any list of UTType string constants.  My question was &quot;where can I find this in MT?&quot;  If the authoritative answer really is nowhere, then has anyone gone to the trouble of making a collectionof constant strings that I can steal? And why hasn't MT got this given that the NSString keys were put in?

If no one has done it maybe I'll put a static class up on github to share...
