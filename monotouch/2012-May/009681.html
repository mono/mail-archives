<PRE>I've added a sample on how to use touchesbegan/move/ended etc:
<A HREF="http://monotouch.2284126.n4.nabble.com/file/n4645783/dragimage.cs">http://monotouch.2284126.n4.nabble.com/file/n4645783/dragimage.cs</A>
dragimage.cs 

And then in your main view add:


but this is not the way to go ;) from the StackScrollView sample i found
that they are using a gesture recognizer (UIPanGestureRecognizer) to
eventually move the views, combined with some animations to create a bounce
effect when the gesture stops. I'm trying to re-write the sample in
MonoTouch, if i succeed, i will post it.

The problem is that Objective-C looks a bit alien to me... and also they are
using a lot of views that have views which add views which add tableviews
which add intances of other tableviews etc etc where we would just derive a
view from UITableViewController and get it over with ;) Monotouch is s&#243;&#243;&#243;&#243;
much easier :) so i have to analyze carefully to see if what they're doing
is actually usefull, or not necessary in C#.

Also, the StackScrollView sample is build around the principle that you can
drilldown to infinity, and they've tried to create a some sort of generic
approach to achieve this, but i'm not very fond of the close coupling of
classes and the smell of recursiveness... for my purpose, i only have to
drill down 3 levels max, which will make life a lot easier, and would make
the understanding of the Objective-C code easier as well. Almost 90% of the
code in the sample is dedicated to administer all the left- and right (sub)
views and the relation between them, to infinity &amp; beyond.
