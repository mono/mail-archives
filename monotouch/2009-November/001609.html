<PRE>I was discussing this with a friend of mine and he pointed out that Apple
has made some big changes between iPhone versions in its handling of ARM
Thumb mode &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture#Thumb">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture#Thumb</A>&gt;. Whether or
not that is the primary reason for the change in app startup performance
between the 2G and 3G is unclear - although it seems you could test that
theory by unchecking &quot;Compile for Thumb&quot; in XCode's build options and
re-testing on both platforms. With the 3GS, the instruction set was expanded
to include Thumb-2
&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture#Thumb-2">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture#Thumb-2</A>&gt;which supports
limited floating point operations and is generally less
problematic than the old architecture for mixed Thumb/ARM instructions.
Building for &quot;Optimized&quot; in XCode produces a fat binary which will use
Thumb-1 for 2G and 3G phones and Thumb-2 for 3GS.

I have no idea how any of that translates to MT because I haven't looked at
the build switches it uses against the native code.
