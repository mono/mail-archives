<PRE>Actually, the problem with the tab bar controller occurs when you don't have
your (populated) tab bar controller in your main nib.  For example, if you
had a splash screen/login screen that you were trying to get up as quickly
as possible and then loaded the tab bar controller separately.  In my app,
that's what I'm trying to make happen as quickly as possible.

However, your second point in interesting, if you're doing stuff in loadView
(or viewDidLoad) then I think your code is still being executed during nib
load time.  That's why I was suggesting if you want to really get the
maximum benefit of not using a monolithic nib, you'd look at overriding
viewWillAppear, which should be getting called when you actually cause a
specific tab view to be displayed, so you could defer constructing the UI
for that tab till that point.   As I said before, the idea isn't that you're
going to get your speed improvement just by doing the same thing in your
code that  initWithNibName:bundle: does, it's going to come from breaking up
the work so that it doesn't happen all at once when you load the main nib.
