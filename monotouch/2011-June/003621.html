<PRE>The World isn't perfect but, just to know, I have a real enterprise
application running on Windows Mobile, with SQL Mobile 2005 and .netcf 2.0,
that was ported to MonoTouch with Sqlite in a few days maybe to missing
things on iOS comparing to Windows, but this is about UI.

Another missing feature was SQL Mobile RDA, but OK, that was recreated where
needed on MonoTouch.

In more 2 hours iPad project core/libraries was ported to MonoDroid so,
database subscription and build, queries, rules, etc are all the same on 3
devices/OS. Android just do not have more than a test login screen and a
home to see a report to proof data downloaded because I don't know yet to
code axml screens since I'm focusing on server data distributor, sync
between distributor and publisher, and porting more iPad screens from
Windows Mobile and making client requests.

All runs fine and symmetric. Is not the same .cs files on HD but really easy
to maintain and have a new thing made on ipad do pass back to android and
windows mobile between mac and Windows with Windows 7 on a VM on just a Mac
Book with 4GB of RAM. And easy one to make it on Windows Phone 7 if this run
with some more real Sqlite since SQL CE from Mango sucks without ADO.NET.

It's possible and real. Not so mature environment for developing nor perfect
since Novell is gone but compatible with future Xamarin. A complex
application for enterprises with modules and rules coming from server
depending on the client. Each one has some particularities and need and just
one software make it all.

Subject:  SPAM-LOW:  Re: [MonoTouch] Advice

Hi,
 If you are new to MonoTouch this is my very recent experience with quick
development attempt:
<A HREF="http://reddevnews.com/articles/2011/05/31/cross-platform-mobile-development-">http://reddevnews.com/articles/2011/05/31/cross-platform-mobile-development-</A>
with-net.aspx.

We invested some time in it and got caught in Attachmate/Novell story.

There is one more option for a quick iOS application creation:
<A HREF="https://build.phonegap.com/docs/ios-builds">https://build.phonegap.com/docs/ios-builds</A>

A book: &quot;iPhone Apps with HTML, CSS and JavaScript&quot; (very quick read)
explains it all. So depending on functionality needed by your app maybe it
could be an option too.
