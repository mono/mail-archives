<PRE>I've pretty much managed to convert an Android app into  monotouch but I am
completely stuffed on this one= I am really desperate

Clearly having a senior moment 

It's probably the way I've constructed my code and having a tendency to
functional programming J

 

I've got a viewcontroller and view (actually one of s series of tabs) - on
this there is simply a button (add persons) and a table crewTable

 

I've implemented my own tablesource as per tutorials 

User presses 'Add Person'  subview added and lots of detail is then added
for that name 

Press save on nav bar - the Edi Dialog disappears and the name alone is
added to the TableSource

So far so good 

 

If the user taps on a row in the table - Alert comes up and displays what
was selected 

This takes place in the tablesource.rowselected method

 

What I want is to present user with choice to edit or delete the item 

The table item is a name - that's all thats displayed in the tableview - but
there is a public class holding a load more info which was created in a
dialog view 

What I want is to get back from the table view the row - that's all but I
just cant see how to do it - the rowselected is a void and I cant understand
how to trap the user tap in the main code 

-          Example 

-          List&lt;string&gt;cl = new List&lt;string&gt;();

-          Cl = myCrew.getcrewlist();

-          myTableViewSource clist = myTableViewSource(cl);

-          crewTable.Source= clist;

 

//===========above code is in finished launching where all my controls
created in IB are visible 

 

// a snippet of myTableViewSource

 

public  class myTableViewSource :UITableViewSource

{   

private List&lt;string&gt; rows;

    public MyTableViewSource(List&lt;string&gt; list)

       {  rows= list;

       } 

//========other methods 

// === such as rows in section 

// ====get cell   

 

Public  override  void  RowSelected(UITableView tableview,NSIndexPath
indexpath)

{

   ShowAlert(&quot;row selected &quot;,&quot;you selected
&quot;+rows[indexPath.Row].tostring());

}

//=======

 

Great, the show alert works but  I can't put anything into the
myTableViewSource.RowSelected method which references the EditDialog in my
main code because it is a class and EditDialog is not visible at this level
and therefore I can't fire up the EditDialog on this touch event  even
though I can fire a showalert 

 

In the main view which contains the table there is an 'add person' button
which when  clicked - it pulls up this EditDialog view - when that is saved
the data is saved and the new name is added to the crewTable and the
EditDialog is dismissed.

What I want is to intercept the event which happens in the rowselected
method of the tablesource class - as above and does the showalert() but to
recall the EditDialog this time populated with the relevant selected persons
data 

 

I am sure there is a straightforward was but I've trawled everywhere and I
cannot find anything helpful all the examples seem to stop at flashing up a
messagebox or something 

 

I would be really grateful for some help even if I am being stupid here
