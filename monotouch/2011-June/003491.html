<PRE>I bought it a few time they released it. No focused on that yet but the code
&quot;behind&quot; between MonoTouch and Monodroid, that came from Windows Mobile
original version of the application is running without issues for now. (in
truth I need to learn to write xml droid awful screens, but the core is
running).

You're a c# developer, so you're probably used to relatively good
documentation, an IDE that doesn't suck much, good tools like
Resharper/Productivity Power Tools, and the confidence that what you write
will likely work when deployed. You don't get much of that with monotouch.
Medium to large sized projects will lag on startup on the device, .5-5
seconds depending on the speed of the processor on the device, enough to
make your users wonder if the app crashed. Since there's no JIT on the
phone, you'll find that you have to do some minor hackage to get
relatively simple LINQ stuff to work. Oh and getting native libraries to
work is a frustrating experience. If everything's not 'right' the
import/library tool fails with no useful output &quot;Mtouch failed with exit
code 1&quot; - friggin' lovely. For a FOSS IDE, MonoDevelop is a nice bit of
work, but it's buggy and tempermental, the last thing you want to deal
with when trying to meet deadlines (well other than having your
development platform pulled out from under you 2 weeks before a major POC
release by a bunch of copraphagic corporate-types). While it's amazing
that they got the on-device debugging to work at all, it too was not a
great experience. Compared to the ease of adding outlets and actions in
Xcode 4, the XIB editing experience in MonoDevelop/Touch is a big slowdown
in your development workflow.

I was a strong proponent of leveraging my skills in c# (and that of the
other developers where I work) by using MonoTouch - fought some battles to
get it accepted at my place of employment - and jumped in headfirst.
Asstachmate only proved that the FUD of the native-only crowd was right.
Don't rely on toys when money is on the line - someone can take them away
from you with no notice.  $399 is a lot of money to spend on a development
curiosity. If you're just wanting to mess around with iOS+C#, wait until
the new version comes out from Orangutangarama or whatever the new
company's name is. Even if it's still toylike, at least the money will go
to some deserving people and not donkey-smegma-gobbling-money-stealing
bastards like those who can be found at Attachmate.


Did anyone else out there get screwed by spending $$$ on MonoDroid?
