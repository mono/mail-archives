<PRE>Attachmate has given us nothing, but lies.  Is anyone getting any real
replies from anyone at Attachmate? We called support, and just got a weasel
answer.

They claimed on their blog post that all Mono products will continue, but
have yet to release *any* updates.

There have been no responses to bugs for weeks, no XCode4 support has been
delivered, monodroid never got the crasher and performance fixes that were
promised, none of the promised APIs, and none of the promised support for
Honeycomb.

Does anyone have the email addresses of the Attachmate executives that have
been commenting in the press on Mono? (Nils Brockman and Jeff Hawn).

We need to reach out to these people and explain to them that this is
unacceptable. They do not seem to understand the first thing about what
these products are, and how their decisions are impacting months of
development for many developers.

I see people talking about refunds and fraud, but that is nothing compared
to the man hours invested in the products these bozos killed. We made major
commitments based on Novell's promises.

A few weeks ago there was talk of a class-action lawsuit, did that go
anywhere? I want to let Attachmate know that I plan to participate on that.
