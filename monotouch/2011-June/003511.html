<PRE>What you're saying doesn't make any sense.

MonoDevelop is developed by the same team, and MonoTouch is an extension of
MonoDevelop.
No doubt developing an IDE is a massive undertaking, but that doesn't soften
the expectations of C# devs
as VS.NET + ReSharper is vastly more productive than MonoDevelop.

They added support to MonoTouch because they wanted.
&gt;<i> They would have been free to say MonoTouch guys &quot;hey! make your own IDE, or
</I>&gt;<i> fork our, but don't use our name!&quot;
</I>

Incorrect, MonoTouch sells the whole dev experience package of productively
being able to develop on iOS with C# - If they just told you to roll with a
text editor the MT value proposition would be much lower.
Not wanting to downplay how good MonoDevelop is (it's a nugget considering
the dev team size) but it doesn't hold a candle to VS.NET + R#.

So the current choice is iOS + XCode/Objective-C(or jetbrains' AppCode) or
MonoDevelop/C#/MonoTouch, and yes, IMO C#/MT is still much better value.
That's not an to suggest they're good enough, cause better IDE's exist.

Anyway none of this matters, we're still in a turbulent time where we're
developing against a deprecated product hanging on for Xamarin's successor
to take it's place.

This whole situation just seems futile to me, Attachmate aren't doing any
favours keeping their useless/unsupported tech closed source and
they're aggravating their customer base, we all know they're incapable of
supporting us but they continue to suggest they're willing and committed -
it's disgusting and serves no purpose except to prevent us from collecting
refunds for an unsupported/deprecated product.
Regardless, Xamarin tech will be source compatible so at least MT
investments have a future.
