<PRE>A) If you just install packages as they are you should NOT do it:

1) there seems only to be XCode 4.2 version of it, so there is not the old interface builder that is needed to compile the XIBs for Monotouch

2) If you update to iOS 5 Beta you will loose the ability to upload the compiled version to the device from the IDE, you will need to use the over the air installation (like testflightapp or similar)

You can however install the XCode 4.2 beta to a different location than the Xcode you use now and run it side by side to test the new API. This will work well.

B) There might be a solution, pretty tricky, but can work. I just do not have the time and will to do it for me to test:

1) install XCode 3.X aside (different location than default)
2) install new XCode and SDK
3) go to the drive and find the XIB and point it to the old Interface Builder
4) make sure the path to the old bin in XCode 3.X is to be found by MT build and linker (system env.)
5) use btouch tool to bind the new API you'd like to use for you manually (well the official MT lib wouldn't be any different in the end)

- So well, lets see the Attachmate's commitment to the support of the product. It took Miguel and his team usually like 6hrs to deliver the first beta when new iOS has been around, lets count the centuries it will be this time.

For me? I'm done with Monotouch. Will wait for Miguel to show his stuff and decide then. The new stuff in iOS 5 looks so tasty I can't miss it (too bad we can't discuss it here due to the Apple NDA).
