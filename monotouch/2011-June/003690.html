<PRE>Hi

During all this talk about MonoTouch (MT) being more or less laid off, Xamarin only on its way, and IOS 5 launching in the fall, I am a bit unsure which technology I should base my next iPad app on.

My current situation is that we have a full  C# winforms application that has a pretty big Business Logic Layer and service interface with a webserver. I need to port this application to iPad as well.

Since I have this large codebase in c# MT seemed an obvious choice. I would just need to create a new data and view layer. But, being unsure if MT will ever make it to IOS5, and unsure if current MT will be able to build to IOS5 (though some forum posts seems to indicate that it might will) I am not sure MT would be the right way.

I probably need a prototype somewhere around september - so just wating for Xamarin doesn't seem valid either. Though development first will start in a month or so.

So another thought I came up with is this:

Is it possible to take a C#/.Net dll, use MT 2.4.2 to compile this to an Objective-C library that is then usable from an Xcode/Objective-C app?

That way I might get best of both worlds as the state is right now. I will be able to reuse my c# logic, but not be dependent on MonoTouch or Xamarin to support IOS5 before my deadline.

There might be better ways - and I am open for suggestions.

Best regards
/anders
