No - in that project I just load 3 at startup. That was an app I was
rewriting in C# (from the original ObjC). On my 4, the original would
start up in .3 seconds, 1.2 on an 2g iPod. The MT version took 1-1.4 on
the 4, 4.5+ on the 2g iPod. Not a dealbreaker by any means, but I had to
keep an eye on it for the springboard cancellation stuff you mentioned.
Think that kicks in at 20 seconds or so. Side note: some quick cut&amp;paste
action was all that was needed to bring the XIBs over - very handy.

</I>&gt;<i>Oh yes. And a lot of the rest of it. I do a lot of XML processing

</I>&gt;<i>users. As long as it all doesn't break before the Ximarin version
</I>&gt;<i>comes out, I should be good....
</I>
Miguel &amp; Co's interpretation of the UI* stuff is terrific. I miss that the
most - followed closely by not having to spend much time in Instruments
checking for leaks. Thought I was through with NSZombie for good.
