<PRE>My gut feeling is that the team, being free of the corporate -tt&#173;chm-t-
fumes, will fan their own forges. They will struggle, but soon the c#/iOS
world will change it's foundation &#173; the Xamarin sun will shine forever.

Subject:  Re: [MonoTouch] Should I Update to IOS5?

Thanks mate for your detailed reply. Cleared up a few issues.

I'll be taking your advice and not upgrading. Its good to know I will still
be able to deploy a version of my app built against 4.3 to the app store
even when 5 goes GM (Did i understand that correctly?!)

Lastly, as virtually all members of this group are relying on xamarin for
some info at the minute, perhaps someone who has a better understanding
(than me) of how monotouch works at a lower level could answer this...

How long do you guys think the task xamarin has taken on would take to
complete? Is it just a case of running the iOS sdk though an automated tool,
and then just csharpafying (a new word?!) all the little bits and peices
(changing arrays to generic lists, etc...)

Would it be another 3 or 4 months, or closer to 8 - 12 months? I know its a
wild guess, and im sure they have other things to delay them (setting up
business, legal issues...), but just from a coding point of view.

Like everyone here im just treading water here, unsure of the future of
this. Still, if xamarin get this out soon, before the monotouch community
dies, it will mean a much more solid future for C# on the iPhone.

Thanks in advance!
