<PRE>Thanks mate for your detailed reply. Cleared up a few issues.

I'll be taking your advice and not upgrading. Its good to know I will still
be able to deploy a version of my app built against 4.3 to the app store
even when 5 goes GM (Did i understand that correctly?!)

Lastly, as virtually all members of this group are relying on xamarin for
some info at the minute, perhaps someone who has a better understanding
(than me) of how monotouch works at a lower level could answer this...

How long do you guys think the task xamarin has taken on would take to
complete? Is it just a case of running the iOS sdk though an automated tool,
and then just csharpafying (a new word?!) all the little bits and peices
(changing arrays to generic lists, etc...)

Would it be another 3 or 4 months, or closer to 8 - 12 months? I know its a
wild guess, and im sure they have other things to delay them (setting up
business, legal issues...), but just from a coding point of view.

Like everyone here im just treading water here, unsure of the future of
this. Still, if xamarin get this out soon, before the monotouch community
dies, it will mean a much more solid future for C# on the iPhone.

Thanks in advance!

</I>&gt;<i> chances of that are zero now, IMO. I'd expect Xamarin to do it once XT

</I>&gt;<i> (Miguel, if you are watching, can we get an update? Anything? Even
</I>&gt;<i> just &quot;yup, we are alive....&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if you install the SDK, expect MT not to work, and expect no way to
</I>&gt;<i> fix it without removing the SDK and reinstalling in the 4.3 one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, if you install the 5.0 SDK, and build against it, you can't
</I>&gt;<i> submit anything to the appstore until it's all RTM. They will reject
</I>&gt;<i> it outright (same goes for Obj-C, tho you can install both in
</I>&gt;<i> parallel, not sure how)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for the device, upgrading should be fine. You can build a 4.3
</I>&gt;<i> binary (as you do now) and deploy it to a 5.x phone, no problem (based
</I>&gt;<i> on past experience). HOWEVER, if the past is anything to go by, Beta 1
</I>&gt;<i> will be unstable and buggy, and you have no way to go back to 4.x if
</I>&gt;<i> you need to. So either do it on a test device, or be prepared to have
</I>&gt;<i> a somewhat broken phone for a while. If it's due to drop in October,
</I>&gt;<i> I'd start using the betas around 1 Sept.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, the 4.3 betas nuked battery life in B1 and B2, tho the
</I>&gt;<i> later ones were ok (I _needed_ tethering, so I had to upgrade)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The exception to that is if you need to support iOS 5 stuff - iCloud
</I>&gt;<i> for eg. Then you need to weigh up not being able to deploy vrs getting
</I>&gt;<i> new stuff done. Also keep in mind that you'll need to do the btouch
</I>&gt;<i> bindings yourself, 'cos there aren't any bindings for iOS5 (again,
</I>&gt;<i> thanks to Attachmate)....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, if I had to do iCloud stuff, I'd be doing it in ObjC for
</I>&gt;<i> the moment. Any stuff you learn will translate back to XamTouch
</I>&gt;<i> easily, an you get to use the new stuff right now. You can't deploy it
</I>&gt;<i> anywhere except your own device until October (&quot;fall&quot;) regardless of
</I>&gt;<i> what or how you do it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Being I have production apps to support, I'm going to most likely
</I>&gt;<i> install iOS5 SDK on another mac (I have a macmini as a media center),
</I>&gt;<i> if at all, and just read the docs. I'm going to eave my macbook pro as
</I>&gt;<i> is (including NOT upgrading to Lion), as if it stops working, I stop
</I>&gt;<i> working. It's bad enough that debugging keeps breaking in MD..... and
</I>&gt;<i> then stops breaking. And starts again.... &lt;sigh&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As soon as XT is out and stable, I'll move to that and upgrade everything
</I>&gt;<i> else.
