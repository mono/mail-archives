<PRE>Today I read from MS about SQL CE details on MSDN, the so dreamed &quot;feature&quot;
missing SQL CE is there now but with a huge problem: No ADO.NET, lol&#138;. We
just have Linq to access and write data to this DB. I think this is
unacceptable. Microsoft already killed a lot of people making WP 7 not
compatible (no C++ for example) with Windows Mobile, then no SQL CE on WP 7,
and now yes SQL CE but without ADO.NET. So why they created ADO.NET? To
abandon it? For sure SQL CE knows how to parse queries but they don't give
the access.

So now that I have a core compatible with windows (windows forms, wpf and
also ASP.NET if is the case), windows mobile, iOS and Android, to make our
applications to work on WP7 we will have to, or rebuild everything (No
ExecuteNonQuery, ExecureReader etc) or to do a new layer to run with ADO on
all &quot;legacy&quot; devices (windows, windows mobile, iOS and Android) and to run
with Linq to SQL on WP7. (Like, rebuild ADO.NET mos used objects and methods
like Command, ExecuteNonQuery and ExecuteReader that makes a ADO query on
other devices and makes Link to SQL queries on SQL CE :/)

The list is growing: Attachmate/Novell, now Microsoft. Who's next?

(I know that it could be a bit offtopic here but I think that I'm not the
only one trying to do applications that can share core code with many (or
all) devices, btw, that's the idea on C# with mono)
