<PRE>Blame? Absolutely not. It is what it is, and as time goes by it will likely get better. 

Actually what the first part of my rant was was my frustration over the recent handling of the product, exacerbated by a very long day followed by too much beer and a lack of filter between spleen and keyboard. Misdirected angst? For sure! I have to hand it to the ximian and MD volunteers - no &quot;and the horse you rode in on&quot; replies yet.  The private message stating &quot;it takes a skilled team to build a barn but any idiot can knock one down&quot; was accurate, though. 

A better way of putting it would have been &quot;here is a list of minor things you may run into developing with this stack&quot;, THEN the pointless griping about our favorite company. Or to have typed it all out, looked it over, then deleted it instead of sending.
