<PRE>I'd suggest that you dont. For a few reasons.

First, if we were in the situation we were in before Attachmate dumped
the project and team, I'd expect a beta of MT within 48 hours. But the
chances of that are zero now, IMO. I'd expect Xamarin to do it once XT
(XamarinTouch!) is up and running, but I suspect thats a while away
(Miguel, if you are watching, can we get an update? Anything? Even
just &quot;yup, we are alive....&quot;)

So if you install the SDK, expect MT not to work, and expect no way to
fix it without removing the SDK and reinstalling in the 4.3 one.

Also, if you install the 5.0 SDK, and build against it, you can't
submit anything to the appstore until it's all RTM. They will reject
it outright (same goes for Obj-C, tho you can install both in
parallel, not sure how)

As for the device, upgrading should be fine. You can build a 4.3
binary (as you do now) and deploy it to a 5.x phone, no problem (based
on past experience). HOWEVER, if the past is anything to go by, Beta 1
will be unstable and buggy, and you have no way to go back to 4.x if
you need to. So either do it on a test device, or be prepared to have
a somewhat broken phone for a while. If it's due to drop in October,
I'd start using the betas around 1 Sept.

For example, the 4.3 betas nuked battery life in B1 and B2, tho the
later ones were ok (I _needed_ tethering, so I had to upgrade)

The exception to that is if you need to support iOS 5 stuff - iCloud
for eg. Then you need to weigh up not being able to deploy vrs getting
new stuff done. Also keep in mind that you'll need to do the btouch
bindings yourself, 'cos there aren't any bindings for iOS5 (again,
thanks to Attachmate)....

Personally, if I had to do iCloud stuff, I'd be doing it in ObjC for
the moment. Any stuff you learn will translate back to XamTouch
easily, an you get to use the new stuff right now. You can't deploy it
anywhere except your own device until October (&quot;fall&quot;) regardless of
what or how you do it.

Being I have production apps to support, I'm going to most likely
install iOS5 SDK on another mac (I have a macmini as a media center),
if at all, and just read the docs. I'm going to eave my macbook pro as
is (including NOT upgrading to Lion), as if it stops working, I stop
working. It's bad enough that debugging keeps breaking in MD..... and
then stops breaking. And starts again.... &lt;sigh&gt;

As soon as XT is out and stable, I'll move to that and upgrade everything else.
