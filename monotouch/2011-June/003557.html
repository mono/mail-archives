<PRE>Hi Anders,

Reading to your post on Bugzilla I noticed that you are using it with multi
thread access on Sqlite. Maybe here a dfference from what I'm working.
Someplace I read months ago that Sqlite isn't a good choice for multithread.
But I don't know where I read it. I ever don't know if ths is true since
it's just a fragmented memory and I don't make parallel access do sqlite
from devices.

But there is some info to read:
<A HREF="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=MultiThreading">http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=MultiThreading</A>
And: 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread-local_storage#C.23_and_other_.NET_langua">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread-local_storage#C.23_and_other_.NET_langua</A>
ges

Taken from: <A HREF="http://go-mono.com/forums/#nabble-td1529563">http://go-mono.com/forums/#nabble-td1529563</A>

Maybe you find some tip there. As &quot;my users&quot; on devices access data base
just when they make some action, like open a view, tap on a button etc, all
things on database are made in this events, making things inside no multi
access mode. Maybe with that I don't have issues.

Karl
