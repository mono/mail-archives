<PRE>This might be where I am going.

I'm off for the weekend now, but will try the &quot;one connection per thread&quot; Monday morning and see where that takes me.

I don't think it will suffice though, since my single threaded approach in my sample experiences the same crash as the threaded one.

But it might be worth a shot.

Hi Anders,

Reading to your post on Bugzilla I noticed that you are using it with multi thread access on Sqlite. Maybe here a dfference from what I'm working. Someplace I read months ago that Sqlite isn't a good choice for multithread. But I don't know where I read it. I ever don't know if ths is true since it's just a fragmented memory and I don't make parallel access do sqlite from devices.

But there is some info to read: <A HREF="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=MultiThreading">http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=MultiThreading</A>
And: <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread-local_storage#C.23_and_other_.NET_languages">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread-local_storage#C.23_and_other_.NET_languages</A>

Taken from: <A HREF="http://go-mono.com/forums/#nabble-td1529563">http://go-mono.com/forums/#nabble-td1529563</A>

Maybe you find some tip there. As &quot;my users&quot; on devices access data base just when they make some action, like open a view, tap on a button etc, all things on database are made in this events, making things inside no multi access mode. Maybe with that I don't have issues.

Karl
