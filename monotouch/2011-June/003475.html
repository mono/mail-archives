<PRE>It's been over 2 weeks and I've yet to receive any reply on any of my
enquiries either.

I even sent the same feedback on the article saying that they would continue
to support Attachmate voicing my concerns and their lack of efforts
MonoTouch/* and it's still &quot;awaiting moderation&quot;

&lt;<A HREF="http://www.novell.com/prblogs/?p=3793">http://www.novell.com/prblogs/?p=3793</A>&gt;Basically apart from saying that they
would, they have shown no signs of supporting MonoTouch in any capacity
since they retired the Mono team.

Not sure what the best way forward, apart from publicizing their
non-existing support.
