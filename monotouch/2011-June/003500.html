<PRE>&gt;<i> No - in that project I just load 3 at startup. That was an app I was
</I>&gt;<i> rewriting in C# (from the original ObjC). On my 4, the original would
</I>&gt;<i> start up in .3 seconds, 1.2 on an 2g iPod. The MT version took 1-1.4 on
</I>&gt;<i> the 4, 4.5+ on the 2g iPod. Not a dealbreaker by any means, but I had to
</I>&gt;<i> keep an eye on it for the springboard cancellation stuff you mentioned.
</I>&gt;<i> Think that kicks in at 20 seconds or so. Side note: some quick cut&amp;paste
</I>&gt;<i> action was all that was needed to bring the XIBs over - very handy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Excellent. I'm totally avoided* XIB's - I tend to use it to do layout,
then just build everything in code with those co-ords.

* ok, one or 2 places I do, but more 'cos I didn't know what I was
doing 10 months ago!

&gt;<i> Miguel &amp; Co's interpretation of the UI* stuff is terrific. I miss that the
</I>&gt;<i> most - followed closely by not having to spend much time in Instruments
</I>&gt;<i> checking for leaks. Thought I was through with NSZombie for good.
</I>
hehe pity..... being that the Xamarin version _is_ going to happen*,
whats your deployment timeframe? Do you need to support the new iOS 5
stuff _right away_? (assuming there is new iOS5 stuff- but of course
there will be) It's all cost-benefit-risk - if the cost of rewriting
it is more than the cost/risk of leaving it in MT, using 4.0.3 until
the Xamarin one comes out - then why port it?

For me, it would cost me WAY more to rewrite than the risk. So I'm
sticking with it until I have to switch (or buy the Xamarin one)
