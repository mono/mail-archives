Subject: [MonoTouch] Some questions about MonoTouch


Hello.

I am a newbie of MonoTouch and preparing apps for iOS.

I have already investigated Adobe Flash with PFI, however, it may be not fit for my purpose and situation.
Therefore, I am investigating the features of MT and reading only book - &quot;Professional iPhones Programming with MonoTouch and .NET/C#&quot;.
I am a Silverlight developer since SL 1.1 Alpha and I don't want to learn Objective C. :)


I have some questions about MonoTouch.

- Is it possible to implement the functions of normal PDF viewer like showing, zooming, panning a PDF document and selecting text and annotating on it with MonoTouch?

[yes. Anything is possible. Some of that functionality is built in, some of it will have to be built]


- How fast are apps developed by MonoTouch, compared to them from Xcode? What I want to know is the performance and optimization level of MonoTouch compiler.

[Depends. Most apps won't notice an appreciable difference for most things. Some things are faster, some things are slower]


- Does MonoTouch support GPU acceleration on iOS or OpenGL well?

[yes. You can use all the native libraries, some of which are GPU accelerated, some are not. OpenGLES is available]


- Does MonoTouch support manipulating Zip files or does related 3rd party components exist?

[I don't know the answer to this]


- Is it possible to open my own files with exclusive extension via iTunes?

[yes.]


- Which encryption methods are supported at MonoTouch? For compliance to Silverlight, supporting AES is essential.

[much of system.cryptography is there, as is the secure storage/key stuff that apple exposes]


- I know that MT does not provide MultiscaleImage yet. If MT development team has a plan to implement it, when will it be available?
 [I'm not sure what you're asking here. Maybe someone else can chime in.]


If you could take a few minutes to answer my questions, I would really appreciate it.
Thank you in advance for your help and apologize for my short English skill.
