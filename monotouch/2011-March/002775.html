<PRE>Hi there

I'm trying to do something which should, I hope, be pretty easy.

I have a photo, which has come off the iPhone camera. I want to scale
it down a bit (take the longer side down to around 2500 pixels, so
it's under 2 meg as a JPEG), but keep the orientation.

I found this nice bit of obj-c after a bit of hunting:

<A HREF="http://blog.twoalex.com/2009/05/11/scaling-uiimages-without-losing-orientation/">http://blog.twoalex.com/2009/05/11/scaling-uiimages-without-losing-orientation/</A>

Looking at it, it appears to do the job, and I can see it being
referred to all over the (obj-c) place.

Then I found a port of it to monotouch, here:

<A HREF="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4739231/uiimage-data-always-in-landscape-mode">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4739231/uiimage-data-always-in-landscape-mode</A>

Unless I missed something, from a line-by-line comparison, it should
also work. But I get a nice white JPEG of the correct size, as does
the author of the SO post.

Anyone have any ideas?

One thing I noticed is, while the EXIF orientation when I run the code
says 8 (Right), Preview says 6 (90deg CCW). I tried switching around
the 6 and 8 code paths, but no joy. I also tried his &quot;solution&quot;, which
doesn't make any difference. I did play with some of the
CGAffineTransform.MakeTranslation stuff, but no consistent joy.

Anyone done this?

Thanks

N
