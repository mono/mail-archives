<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Thanks - so there is no major difference, if, say, one had a
</I>&gt;<i> multi-core iOS device :) , in using ThreadPool vrs NSOperation (or
</I>&gt;<i> whatever the Cocoa(Touch) class is which does threading)?
</I>
Well, NSOperation merely encapsulates the activity.   You still have
to schedule it, how you schedule that one has a few parameters, so you
might want to check on what NSOperation offers.   I believe some of
the schedulers allow you to execute operations in order, like a queue,
using a single thread.

With MonoTouch 4, you also have a new construct called a Task (from
System.Threading), part of the parallel framework.   And you also have
a choice of how you schedule this task for execution.   The default
scheduler merely uses the Mono threadpool.   Other schedulers provide
different options, or you can write your own.

&gt;<i> And in the tradition of killing kittehs... if I'm not using IB, is
</I>&gt;<i> monotouch 4 alpha (beta?) stable enough for day to day use and
</I>&gt;<i> submission to the appstore?
</I>
I use it for TweetStation 2.   We certainly could use people's
feedback on this.

In general, it should generate better code with LLVM, but you really
need to test your app, and let us know if we missed something, or if
there is a regression.

&gt;<i> I'm just about to release a version of one of my apps (using 3.x), but
</I>&gt;<i> after that, I'd love to use the bleeding edge stuff, assuming I can
</I>&gt;<i> roll back to 3.x if it all goes to custard.....
</I>
You can roll back.
</PRE>
