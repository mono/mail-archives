<PRE>Respected Sir/Ma'am,

I had mailed regarding my skills/experience to the monodevelop mailing list.
Sharique had asked me to forward the mail to you.

Kindly help me proceed with it. My skills/experience are mentioned
below. I certainly think that I would be helpful in the XNA framework wiith
Windows Phone 7 related projects. Kindly guide as to what to do as I
proceed.

The forwarded mail:-

Respected Sir/Ma'am,
I have a couple of questions related to pursuing a project under your
organization:-
&gt;<i> 1. Can I send you my skill sets to you before the actual starting of the
</I>&gt;<i> deadline, so that you could review it beforehand &amp; tell me specifically if
</I>I
&gt;<i> could be of any help.
</I>
I guess sharing your skills and past works here might be sufficient.

&gt;<i> 2. I have spent a lot of time in learning/gathering knowledge till now.
</I>&gt;<i> Hence, I feel it is time that I develop my skill sets by working on Real
</I>&gt;<i> World Projects.
</I>&gt;<i> My experience/Interests:-
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Good programming skills in C,C++,C#,JAVA.
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  I have also worked on websites, &amp; have a good amount of knowledge in
</I>&gt;<i> JQuery, JavaScripts, CSS, XML/HTML, AJAX, Flash based websites.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. I have worked on Windows Phone 7 mobile OS platform &amp; developed many
</I>&gt;<i> apps/games for the same. Since it is not open source, I have sourced it in
</I>&gt;<i> my college, with a lot of positive feedbacks from the college students.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. I have worked on a full 3-D Car racing game as part of my on-college
</I>&gt;<i> project. As a result I had to start right from scratch, ie, creating a car
</I>&gt;<i> in MAYA, rendering it using DirectX &amp; then converting it into an fbx
</I>object
&gt;<i> so as to use it in a Windows-based game which works on XNA 3.1 framework.
</I>&gt;<i> I am very much interested in the Application Development of Axiom 3D
</I>Engine.
&gt;<i> Kindly tell me whether I would be helpful in such a project.
</I>
Goto Axiom site, check features feature wish list, todo list, engage
in forum and play with the engine, so that you will have better idea
what should be your plan for this GSoC.

&gt;<i> Also, since I am behind a proxy server at my campus/college I am not able
</I>to
&gt;<i> connect to irc.gnome.org &amp; cant find your channels on freenode.net.
</I>&gt;<i> Kindly tell me how to proceed with the App development of Axiom 3D Engine.
</I>&gt;<i> Hoping for a favourable reply.
</I>&gt;<i> With Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> --
