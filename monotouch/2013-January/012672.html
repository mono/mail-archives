<PRE>Hi Juan, my two cents here. I have not used MonoCross. But I did give
MvvmCross a serious go for a few days back about six weeks ago. I really
liked the range of features it was advertised to cover, and it has the look
of applying good design principles. Every framework of course has certain
principles it's based on that may or may not line up with your current needs
or preferences. For me I went a different course after trying hard to commit
to it. No poke at Stuart intended - he's done great work here, and looks to
be continuing with it. But in the end I felt the framework was fairly
&quot;heavy&quot; feeling. Lots of small parts and a fair amount of &quot;inherited&quot;
behavior that produced auto-magical abilities if you knew how to plug into
it, or unexpected behavior/misbehavior if you didn't. I kinda hit my
frustration limit and moved on. The support of PCL libraries is interesting
and has the potential to reduce project redundancy for x-platform solutions,
but it can be a pain to work with especially when you have to write plugins
for 3rd party libs.

Most of the comments I've seen on stackoverflow and such have been positive
and supportive of MvvmCross. So I may be in the minority in my conclusion
here. :-) Regardless, there's a lot to learn or borrow from the framework
code which can be useful in your own endeavors.

Fwiw!

Dennis
