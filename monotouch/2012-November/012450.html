<PRE>Hi Kris,

What you are describing is the VSS way of doing things.

Checking files in and out is something which VSS uses to ensure
concurrency, whereas other source control systems allow developers to work
at the same time and merge their changes.

I think you have 2 choices:

1. Learn how to use a DVCS such as Git, or Mercurial.

2. Use VSS which you know how to use.

If the command line is a problem, there are tools which allow you to use
Git in a GUI:

- the GitHub GUI
- SourceTree by Atlassian (I prefer this one)
- TortoiseGit

I use Mercurial at work, Git at home.

Regards,

James

I have been trying to use Github to do Source Control. Needless to say i am
getting very irritated. I am an &quot;old school&quot; developer. That last time i
used any source control system and worked as part of a team i used Visual
SourceSafe back in Visual Studio 6. Here is what i am trying to accomplish:

1) I need to be able to control source files individually (have team
members check files out and back in individually so team members can
collaborate on our App).
2) i DO NOT need branching or any of that open source stuff. We have a
single app and only a few developers.

Problems i have been having:

It appears (unless i am just an idiot):

1) Github does NOT like it when you change a file and don't want to commit
the changes in that file to the repository. (I tried to revert and it
insisted i commit my changes first.. GRRRR isn't that the definition of
&quot;REVERT&quot;? To roll back my changes?)
2). It appears you can not check out individual files.. you must check out
the entire project and you must do it using a command line? WAY NOT COOL..
i need this to be easy..
3) The GITHub app seems to error constantly.. Complains about things and
gives you only command line examples how to fix the issues it is erring
about.
4). I hate command line interfaces.. we are not in the 80's anymore guys..
i want a simple and error free GUI interface.

So is there a better tool for what i want to do? I would prefer one
compatible with mono's version control.. but if i have to i am ok with
doing all of it outside of mono in a stand alone app. Also, i don't mind
paying if i get what i want. Thanks in advance guys..

Thanks,

Kris Bloom
