<PRE>Hi,

We wish to express our most sincere thanks fo all the support and help we got
from Xamarin and the whole MonoTouch user community. Without it, our Targister
app could not have been created.

<A HREF="https://itunes.apple.com/app/targister/id524801348">https://itunes.apple.com/app/targister/id524801348</A>

Respectfully,

Guido


Targister
The 'Targ(et Reg)ister'

~~~ Introduction ~~~

'Targister' is your personal coach to register, monitor and achieve your
weight, BMI and related target values.

'Targister' compares your daily values to your target values and to
yesterday's values. Values are rendered green if improved, red if worse
and orange if unchanged.

This instant visual feedback is an ideal stimulator in the hard struggle
to achieve and maintain your targets.

'Targister' shows your evolution in a nicely colored graph to get
instant visual feedback. It shows daily, weekly, monthly as well as
yearly results so that you can easily view your progress over a longer
period.

Registered data can be ordered on any of the fields, both in ascending
and descending order.

'Targister' supports both 'Kg/Centimeter' and 'Pounds/Inches'.

~~~ BMI calculation ~~~

'Targister' needs to know your length to perform correct BMI
calculation. It can be specified by tapping the 'User data' button in
the 'User and units info' section of the main 'Targister' menu.

~~~ Adding your data ~~~

The right upper corner shows a '+' button. Tapping this button shows a
view that allows you to add, modify or remove daily values as well as
target values. Do read the instructions on that view (i.e. tap the '+'
and be sure to read and slide all the way down).

~~~ Navigation ~~~

'Targister' supports the normal iOS navigation by means of clickable
buttons, back buttons etc. But it also supports navigation by swiping.

Right swiping returns to the previous view if any, it has the same
functionality as the back button in the left upper corner. Left swiping
immediately switches to the main menu.

~~~ The menu ~~~

The main 'Targister' view presents a menu with following sections:
'List records'
'Target, Order &amp; Delta'
'Behaviour'
'Appearance'
'Fields management'
'User and units info'
'Varia'

Sections are differentiated by a bolder text and a light-gray
background. Help and information about these sections is available by
tapping these section buttons.

Note that if no records are available, the buttons of the 'List records'
will merely display this help text. So to get started, you should tap
the '+' button in the upper right corner and fill in your current
values.

~~~ Help ~~~

The upper left corner of the main 'Targister' menu title bar shows a '?'
button that triggers the display of this main 'Help' view.

The views of the app show help and information at the bottom of the
view. So whenever you're in doubt, just slide down to the bottom and
read specific topic related help.

It is strongly encouraged to read all these topic related help texts to
achieve maximum benefit from daily use of 'Targister'.

Your questions, comments, suggestions and success stories are highly
appreciated at <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monotouch">targister at molly-corp.com.</A>

Happy and successful 'Targister'-ing!
</PRE>
