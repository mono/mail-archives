<PRE>Hi,

With the help of you guys I managed to create and upload my ipa
archives with the same uuid as the distributed apps.

Maybe this can help fellow developers, so here's my setup:

I have a distribution profile that produces a myapp.app directory.

After building for distribution with MonoDevelop (or from the command
line) a perl script performs following steps in sequence:

1) create a 'Finder compress' style zip file that could be uploaded to
the app store:

ditto -c -k --sequesterRsrc --keepParent myapp.app myapp.zip

2) Copy my &quot;Ad Hoc Distribution&quot; provision as embedded.mobileprovision

cp Ad_Hoc_Distribution.mobileprovision myapp.app/embedded.mobileprovision

This will overwrite the &quot;App Store Distribution&quot; provision copied into
the myapp.app directory by the build command.

3) Create an ipa that will have the uuid of the app as contained in
the zip file:

xcrun -sdk iphoneos PackageApplication -s Key -v myapp.ap -o myapp.ipa

Notes:

3a) key is the SHA1 key of my 'iPhone Developer' profile. It can be
copied from the output of the build command of MonoDeveloper. You can
also find it by opening your profile with the keychain utility. Click
on the profile and your key is listed as SHA1 at the bottom of the
file. Do drop the spaces between the hex character pairs.

3b) myapp.ipa should be a fully qualified name

This is it.

You can verify the uuid's by issuing

otool -l myapp | grep -i uuid

from within the myapp.app directory. You than unzip the ipa file which
produces a Payloald/myapp.app/ directory. The otool command from
within that directory will show the same uuid.

P.S.: I have not seen yet any live session nor checkpoint logging from my
app store apps, but at least I know the uuid's match and maybe I should
have some patience.

HTH,


Guido
