<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>In the course of porting one Windows Mobile app to iOS with MonoTouch we 
ran into several design/decision problems and today we are stuck and of 
course tensions rise.

Most of the problems are caused by the lack of knowledge of iOS 
programming paradigms, legacy code (historical stuff) and effort to 
reuse existing code as much as possible.

Notation (quasi UML):

     Base/Super class &lt;--------- Derived/specialized class

Steps done:

 1. proof-of-concept (legacy business layer code reuse + UI iOS native xibs)
    UIViewController &lt;----- SomeController (loads xib)
 2. minimizing some platform differences custom UIViewController[s] added
    UIViewController &lt;----- InheritnaceClass01 .... InheritnaceClassNN
    &lt;----- SomeController (loads xib)
 3. removing need for xibs
    UIViewController &lt;----- InheritnaceClass01 .... InheritnaceClassNN
    &lt;----- SomeController (xibless)


There is much more in the app (custom GestureRecognizers) what could 
cause us problems such as after step 3: ButtonEvents and 
GestureRecognizers stopped working.

Generally in step 2. we have only one intermediate class between 
SomeController (xib) and UIViewController, but the question is general:

What needs to be done with custom UIViewController in order to work 
properly?

I suspect that somewhere in inheritance chain event flow and 
registration of derived class is cutoff, so some assumptions:

 1. Register Attribute (done)
 2. Outlets that used to be in designer.cs file (declarations with
    [OutletAttribute] are left intact, but actual initialization is in
    ViewDidLoad()
 3. polymorphism
     1. which methods need to be overriden?? (did override ViewDidLoad())
     2. which overriden methods need to call base??


I don't want to point finger and blame, just looking for suggestion and 
advice. I'm suspecting that in the inheritnace chain/graph events are 
not passed to UIViewController (iOS itself).

Right now project leader suggested (it is hard to say that was a 
suggestion): 1. to recreate all xibs as empty one (or create single in 
app) 2. to change base class of those xib created UIViewControllers to 
UIView

As far as I know UIView and UIViewController are on the same 
&quot;inheritnace level&quot; (deriving from UIResponder), implying they have not 
too much common stuff, implementing different methods, so they are ment 
for different purposes.

I'm concerned about thw worth of the effort: * all ViewDidLoad, 
ViewDidUnload, DidReceiveMemoryWarning must be moved to UIView 
equivalents (if there are any). * constructor UIViewController(string 
nibname, NSBundle nsb) does not exist in UIVIew

My intuition tells me this base class switch leads us further from solution.

And there is question how to load plain UIView in UIWindow in 
AppDelegate... But I'll ask that in another thread...

thx
