<PRE>Hi,

How does one create an app that adapts to iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4 as well
as iPhone 5 screen sizes?

I don't use any hardcoded dimensions in my code, always obtain them via
UIScreen.MainSccreen.Bounds, and the app does not use nibs, all UI
elements are code generated, but the app does not adapt to the taller
iPhone 5 size.

I read some postings that you just have to provide an iPhone 5 launch
image to tell iOS that the app supports iPhone 5. But MonoTouch refuses
my <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monotouch">Default-585 at 2x.png</A> as iPhone Launch Image.

I failed to find some good advice about how to proceed to have an app
that does adapt to all iPhone sizes and use the full height of the
iPhone 5 screen. I have the impression that MD should allow for an
iPhone 5 launch image next to the Default and Retina Display launch
images.

Please advise,


Guido

three hundred years ago. &quot;What is the 'Body of a rock'?&quot; he was asked.
In answer, Musashi summoned a pupil of his and bid him kill himself by
slashing his abdomen with a knife.  Just as the pupil was about to comply,
the Master stayed his hand, saying, &quot;That is the 'Body of a rock'.&quot;
