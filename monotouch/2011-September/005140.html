<PRE>Hi

I have a small question about licensing of MonoTouch now that Xamarin has gained the commercial rights from Novell.

We bought a MonoTouch Enterprise license in april this year. As I understand it, the license granted us a never ending right to use, but only a 1 year software update right.


1.       Is this update right still maintained even though Xamarin now are in charge of the software?

Secondly, we just got the offer for a 50% discount on MonoDroid (if bought together with MonoTouch).


2.       Is the &quot;Novell&quot; MonoTouch license mentioned above eligible to an upgrade license from Xamarin?

I don't think we will buy the MonoDroid right now, but we will need it at some point, and depending how close we get to april next year it might be interesting to combine the two if an interesting offer comes along. Right now it doesn't take a mathematical genius to figure out that saving 50% of MonoDroid while buying an unnecessary upgrade that costs above 50% of MonoDroid isn't a good idea. (unless we get all emotional and want to support Xamarin for their great work!)

I hope somebody can provide a quick answer to the two questions above - so I know if I can upgrade MD/MT without violating my enterprise license, and whether or not we need a new license once the current software update expires.

Best regards
/Anders
