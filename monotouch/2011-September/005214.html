<PRE>Hi Jowi,

Please please please submit bug reports - we want to get MonoDevelop
to the point where it doesn't ever crash (or as close to that ideal as
possible). To do this, we need to know what crashes people are running
into.

&gt;<i> Using xcode 4 interface builder is
</I>&gt;<i> not a real improvement, it's just more complicated. But it works. A bit of a
</I>&gt;<i> shame that i have to learn a lot of stuff over again and that the books i

</I>
Yea, Xcode 4's IB is quite different from Xcode 3's, but I think once
you get used to it you'll like it. We're also working hard on writing
documentation on how to use Xcode 4's IB from the perspectives of both
a new user and as a user who is familiar with Xcode 3's IB, so
hopefully that will help.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, back on topic. I noticed in Monodevelop 2.8 that if i add a iPhone
</I>&gt;<i> or iPad view with controller, that the C# file generated only has one
</I>&gt;<i> constructor:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [code]public KuroInfoController () : base (&quot;KuroInfoController&quot;, null)
</I>&gt;<i> ...[/code]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> where adding a view-with-controller in MonoDevelop 2.6 adds three, plus an
</I>&gt;<i> init function:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> public KuroInfoController (IntPtr handle) : base (handle) ...
</I>&gt;<i> public KuroInfoController (NSCoder coder) : base (coder) ...
</I>&gt;<i> public KuroInfoController () : base (&quot;KuroInfoController&quot;, null) ...
</I>&gt;<i> void Initialize () ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is this a bug in Monotouch? I'm using 4.0.7. Or is this a MonoDevelop
</I>&gt;<i> problem?
</I>
Honestly, I'm not sure. I think most of the old ctors weren't really
valuable and so they were stripped out. You can still add them, of
course.

If you feel they should be created, you could submit a bug report to
<A HREF="http://bugzilla.xamarin.com">http://bugzilla.xamarin.com</A>

I've been writing an iPad app in my spare time and have not felt the
need for these and they never really made sense to me so I haven't
felt the need to poke the MonoDevelop developers about this.

Wish I could have been more helpful,

Jeff
