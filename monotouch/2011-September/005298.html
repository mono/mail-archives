<PRE>Hello Walt,

Could you provide the full deployment log please ?

It should look like:

Please ensure your device is connected...
Connected to: Neptune
This application has been signed with a provisioning profile which does not
include this device
Connected to: Neptune
Installing application
Installation failed: AMDeviceInstallApplication returned: 0xe8000050
The application was terminated by a signal: SIGHUP


The earlier message &quot;This application has been signed with a
provisioning profile which does not include this device&quot; means that an
invalid profile was used. IIRC for that case I was using the
&quot;Distribution&quot; identity/profile instead of my &quot;Developer&quot; profile.
Please let us know if you do not have this (or a similar) message.

&gt;<i> I have tried this on a iPhone 3 at version 4.2.1, iPod 4 at version 5, and
</I>&gt;<i> iPad 2 at version 5. &#160;All 3 result in the same error.
</I>
Using a 'distribution' profile would not be allowed in any device -
provisioned or not.

&gt;<i> Thinking the project may be corrupt, I created a new empty Solution added
</I>&gt;<i> one line of &#160;Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello World&quot;); to it, run it on the
</I>&gt;<i> Simulator and its fine. &#160;But I get the same error when attempting to deploy
</I>&gt;<i> to real hardware.
</I>
Errors from AMDeviceInstallApplication are coming the the device
itself. You won't see them for the simulator because the application
install process is totally different in that case (i.e. the simulator
is not an emulator :-).

Regards,
Sebastien
