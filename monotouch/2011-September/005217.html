</I>What i'm doing is basically replicating the sample on page 77 of the WROX
book 'Professional iPhone Programming with Monotouch and .NET/c#' by
McClure/Bowling/Dunn/Hardy&amp;Blyth.

There they're using a view-with-controller with the 'extra' constructors to
create a xib which is added using interface builder to a TabBarController as
a custom class. If i use the constructor generated by default, it crashes
the xib the moment it is loaded. If i change the constructors to the ones
generated using Monodevelop 2.6, all is fine and the program works...

So my conclusion would be that the stuff generated in 2.8 creates faulty
code... i could test some more and try to find out what is actually going on
and if all three constructors are needed or what else is going on.



I'm not sure if all 3 constructors are needed, i'll try to find out some
more on what is needed.
