<PRE>Hi,

I was wondering if there is a technical reason why it is not possible to
allow dev device deployment under the trial.

I can understand the eval not supporting deployment of apps to the
marketplace.

In my specific case at the moment I am trialling a prototype of innovative
UI I've developed, on device and in the wild, on several platforms which I
hope to be worth taking out of the prototype phase. I had hoped to start on
iPhone using Monotouch, but as it stands I am now heading down the
Objective-C path to get things moving. Unfortunately as I continue further
with this I am erroding part of the motivation for trying Monotouch in the
first place. I am unsure at this stage where this path will lead me.

If this could be overcome I can also see benefits for Xamarin in being able
to tap the interest of a wider dev community who might develop apps for
their own device initially and later get ideas to deploy to the marketplace
once they've invested in learning Monotouch.

Cheers,
Mick.
