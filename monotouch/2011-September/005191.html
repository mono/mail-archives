<PRE>I am going absolutely insane trying to figure out how views are loaded into
the application at run time. Here is my scenario:

I have an application logic controller that is (or will be) common to
Monotouch, Monodroid, Windows Phone, and Windows Tablet applications (it is
already running for Windows Phone and Tablet).

This controller performs tasks and is responsible for asking the UI to move
to the appropriate view based on the result of a previous task. For example,
on startup, the logic controller verifies whether or not the application has
previously been configured and, if not, asks the UI to present the
configuration view to the user. Once the user has completed the
configuration dialog, the application logic controller asks the UI to
present the login view.

In many cases, particularly during the initialization portion, the user must
not be able to navigate backward or forward so a navigationcontroller is not
necessarily appropriate at this stage (after the user has logged in, it will
probably be appropriate).

The important thing to note is that this application controller logic is not
embedded in the UI layer, it is contained in a separate project that is
referenced by and initialized from the UI layer. The UI layer contains a
class that implements an interface which is responsible for causing the UI
to move to the appropriate view.

My issue in this design is in trying to figure out how to change the view
based on the requests from the application logic controller. The current
design consists of a mainwindow in which I load up an initialization view
(splash screen), but after that, even if I have a reference to the main
window stored in the interface implementer, I cannot get the view to change
(I am trying to use Window.AddSubview with a cached reference to the Window
object created in the ApplicationDelegate, but the view never changes).

Almost all of the samples and documentation that I have found on the web
either deal with a single view or have a navigationcontroller; none that I
have found have this type of design. 

I just need to understand how to cause the window to display any given view,
but I don't comprehend how to make this happen at this point, most likely
because I am missing a very important concept. Can anyone shed any light on
this for me?
