</I>I wish i could; i'm trying to create a sample project from scratch using
2.8b2, but there is SO much changed and altered in the options for creating
a new solution, i can't even re-create the project like i did in 2.6... in
2.6 i was using a 'iPhone Window based project' but i can't even find THAT
solution option in 2.8, and the solution options that are available, are
unknown to me and do not even closely resemble those from 2.6...

I'm sorry, but i'm totally lost here... I feel i've spent the last couple of
weeks learning for nothing, everything i've learned using monodevelop 2.6
and xcode 3.6 is either changed, non existing, or doesn't work... 

Please tell me this is all due to the beta stage of Monodevelop 2.8?
