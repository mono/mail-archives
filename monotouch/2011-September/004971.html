Greetings all. 

On the notes for 2.8A2, I saw that 'resource' integration with xcode4 was
possible&#352; 

What I read from this was that &#352; in theory, it would be possible to mark a
.png with a build action of [resource] in MonoDevelop, and when opening
the .xib in XCode4 (via the stub project created by MD), the image would
appear as a resource.

So far, a portion of this integration seems to work, in that the project
navigator in Xcode shows the .png, but the [Image] drop downs are always
blank for things like UIImageView &#352;.and typing in the relative path to the
.png (ex. MyResources/MyImage.png) doesn't result in the image being
displayed in Xcode.

I have been working around this for a while by manually loading UIImage
objects a runtime and assigning them to the various elements, but I
wondering if my hopes of this integration are a little far reaching at
this time :)

Thanks in advance!
