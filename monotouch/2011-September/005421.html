<PRE>Thank you all very much for your help. Using your information, I was able to
get the static library built and loaded into my application, but ran into
various sigalerts, so have decided not to pursue use of this control at this
time.

One disappointing aspect of our foray into the Monotouch world has been the
distinct lack of pre-built third party controls that we can just drop into
the application and start using. Our company has licensed tens of thousands
of dollars worth of third party components for our enterprise MS.Net
applications and would be happy to spend money on quality components for the
Monotouch world, but we haven't been able to find any yet. If anyone has any
suggestions in this area, we would certainly love to hear them.
