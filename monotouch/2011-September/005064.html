<PRE>Something else to keep in mind that has bitten me in the past:

If you present a confirmation dialog, remember that while it's displayed if there's any chance the table could refresh (and thus re-load that cell with a different set of parameters) the wrong &quot;cell&quot; will get acted on instead. This was happening to me because the device was getting TCP communications generated from elsewhere that would alter its list of cells - sometimes removing one, which might cause the cell to be re-populated with different data.

Because only one cell could ever have an active confirmation dialog at any given time, I loaded the parameters of that cell into static properties, and acted on the static properties once the user confirmed.

Thanks. That makes good sense, I will look into that.

Thanks for the help!

Sorry - not the constructor of the cell as that's only called once. I have properties on the cell that are set during GetCell and the values for that might have been passed in to the constructor of the DataSource.

Personally, I pass in the parameters/object it needs to act on to the constructor of the custom cell, and have the event code in the cell perform the required action.

Subject: [MonoTouch] How to add event handler for custom UITableCell button (without it being called many times)?

I am having trouble trying to and an event handler for a delete button that is on a custom UITableCell

Currently the delegate seems to get called several times for each click on the delete button. I am using an anonymous method as I need the indexPath to work out which message to delete.

Can anyone suggest a way of ensuring the event is only called once or an alternative method so I can use the indexPath to determine which message to delete without using an delegate in the GetCell method?

The code I currently have is:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>	public override UITableViewCell GetCell (UITableView tableView, NSIndexPath
indexPath)
		{
SprayCell cell = tableView.DequeueReusableCell (kCellIdentifier) as SprayCell;
			if (cell == null) {
				cell = new SprayCell();
				var views = NSBundle.MainBundle.LoadNib(&quot;SprayCell&quot;,cell,null);
				cell = Runtime.GetNSObject(views.ValueAt(0)) as SprayCell;
				
                                 //If I do this here it only ever tries to delete the 1st few messages
				/*
				cell.DeleteButton.TouchUpInside += delegate { 
				Util.Debug(&quot;cell.DeleteButton.TouchUpInside() - DELETE MsgID&quot; + _list2[indexPath.Row].MessageID);
				};
				*/
				
			};
				
			}
			cell.Text = _list2[indexPath.Row].Body;
			cell.Date1 = &quot;received &quot; +
_list2[indexPath.Row].TimeStamp.ToShortTimeString() + &quot; &quot; +
_list2[indexPath.Row].TimeStamp.ToShortDateString() ; 
			
			cell.DeleteButton.TouchUpInside -= delegate {}; //If I don't have this we get lots of different events firing when we have lots of items in the list
				
			cell.DeleteButton.TouchUpInside +=  delegate
{cell.DeleteButton.TouchUpInside() - DELETE MsgID&quot; + _list2[indexPath.Row].MessageID)}; //Gets called multiple times randomly and regularly at  the top/bottom of the list
			
			return cell;
		}

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

Many Thanks
SK
