<PRE>Hi all

at first thanks for your attention, and then i have two things to say here.
first is that i searched the internet and there were some that said this is
the debugger and it will be solved when you make you last release before
zipping your bundle and then send it to iTunes Connect. and this is the
monotouch link that exactly says that debugger is connected until you
accurate the provisioning properties and disable the debugger so that. this
link tells that your words are right. but i am confused whether you are
telling me that this problem exists even after performing these steps or you
just mean that this is the pre-distribution problem and will solve when
performing this step.

and the second matter is that i am trying to show my splash animately i mean
i animate it from 0 alpha to 1. so if i use that image file i cannot do
that. or maybe there is a hope to do the same just like now.

Your helps was very helpful, i thank you again.

Regards,
PK DEVELOPER
