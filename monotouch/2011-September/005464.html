</I>xCode works perfectly, so does MonoDevelop and MonoTouch. The only issue I
have is Monotouch licensing.

Please keep in mind I use my Windows machine a lot when developing, I have
tons of tools and utilities that only works on Windows. Plus, I just like
Windows more. The only programs I am interested in on the Mac is
MonoDevelop/xCode.

I have tried several approaches:

1. Use Synergy to share keyboard and mouse with the Mac, so I can quickly
switch between the two.
Cons: 
 - Switching video input is slow. Takes 5-10 seconds, which is very
distracting when switching a lot like I do.
 - Low resolution. I have a MacBook, the maximum resolution for an external
display is 1920x1200. This is very low when I am used to 2560x1600 on a 30
inch screen. Using the built in display on the Mac to overcome the slow
video input switching is even worse and would yield only 1280x800.
- Keymapping issues.
- Slow. Compared to my insanely spec'ed desktop PC, the Mac is painfully
slow.

2. Use a VNC viewer connecting to the Mac over the local network on my
Windows machine.
Cons:
- All of the problems of above.
- Very unstable. Perhaps it is my UltraVNC viewer, but I always experience
freezing and problems.
- Copy/paste issues. I need to be able to copy/paste between Windows/Mac.

3. Run Lion in a virtual machine
Cons:
- Works perfectly, none of the cons above. Great performance, high
resolution, copy paste works perfectly, and it's very stable. The only issue
is I cannot install the Monotouch license.

After going from 1 to 3, I found my productivity rate go up a lot, as well
as being a much more comfortable environment.

Anyway, thanks for replying. I will look into a different version of the
boot system for the VM.
