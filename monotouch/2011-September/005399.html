<PRE>I'm aware that running Mac OS in a virtual machine is a controversial issue,
but nevertheless I found myself be much more productive in a PC environment
running MonoDevelop within VMWare.

That works fine for testing in the Simulator, however I have been unable to
install the paid version of MonoTouch in this environment, probably due to
the anti-piracy protection, and thus I cannot test my programs on a physical
device this way.

Is there any way to successfully installing the paid version in a virtual
environment?

For the record, I do have a Mac, but it is very tedious to revert to it
every time I need to do some physical device testing. And I also do have a
licensed copy of Mac OSX for my VMWare session. Apple probably wont accept
this anyway, but perhaps it is time for them to start becoming more flexible
towards their developers... 

Anyway, I think a lot of developers using MonoTouch is coming from a Windows
background, so, although controversial I think it is a question worth
asking... :)
