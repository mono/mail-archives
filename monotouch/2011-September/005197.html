<PRE>Hi,

El 15/09/2011, a las 20:24, Mark Handzlik escribi&#243;:

&gt;<i> I've been distributed my app to over 50 users through testflight and for 2 months it has been running fine. I do the build for the appstore and submit to apple and they reject due to crash. They finally responded to my question on where it crashes. They said upon startup on iPhone and iPad2. How do I load the app I submitted to my device to reproduce? I load the Debug build from same source and it does not crash. 
</I>
That happened to me with iPad 1 (and forced me to buy one).

What I did is take the .app folder that we zip and send to the appstore and using the Xcode Organizer drag&amp;drop and voila it's installed.

However of course this does have debug disabled, and Apple already sent you the crash logs so you'll get not much of a benefit here.
