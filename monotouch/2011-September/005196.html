<PRE>I'm not sure if this a monotouch or monodevelop problem. If been testdriving
monotouch/monodevelop on a vmware OSX Snow Leopard, using XCode3.6. After
some weeks i decided it was time to go for the real thing and buy a Mac
Mini.

Big mistake.

First, the mini comes with Lion installed, and to my surprise Xcode 3.6 is
not compatible with Lion, it just won't install. The only option is Xcode 4.
Which doesnt work with Monodevelop 2.6... after some reading here i found
that there is a monodevelop 2.8 beta 2 which will work with xcode 4, and a
guide how to use xcode 4's interface builder for monotouch. After some
testing i got the combo working on my mac mini, but i must say it is not
very stable. Monodevelop crashes a lot. Using xcode 4 interface builder is
not a real improvement, it's just more complicated. But it works. A bit of a
shame that i have to learn a lot of stuff over again and that the books i
bought are based on Xcode 3.6 IB...

Anyway, back on topic. I noticed in Monodevelop 2.8 that if i add a iPhone
or iPad view with controller, that the C# file generated only has one
constructor:

[code]public KuroInfoController () : base (&quot;KuroInfoController&quot;, null)
...[/code]

where adding a view-with-controller in MonoDevelop 2.6 adds three, plus an
init function:

public KuroInfoController (IntPtr handle) : base (handle) ...
public KuroInfoController (NSCoder coder) : base (coder) ...
public KuroInfoController () : base (&quot;KuroInfoController&quot;, null) ...
void Initialize () ...

Is this a bug in Monotouch? I'm using 4.0.7. Or is this a MonoDevelop
problem?
