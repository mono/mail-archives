<PRE>Allright, this is an issue I have had since monotouch v4.0 came out.

Basically, I have created two Scheduled timers using:

NSTimer.CreateRepeatingScheduledTimer(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(duration), () =&gt;
aFunction());
NSTimer.CreateRepeatingScheduledTimer(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(duration), () =&gt;
aFunction2());

These two timers (which I'm assuming is basically a multithreaded routine)
fire off a bunch of code which manages the whole program. One of the threads
interacts with the GPU using openGL.

Whenever there is a crash in these these threads the program exits without
giving any crash report at all, HOWEVER, in a peculiar fashion, it will
OCCASIONALLY give me a crash description (Like nullPointerException or
IndexOutOfBounds) and take my cursor to the line that broke, but will NOT
produce a stacktrace. This is extremely rare when it will do so and I can
not make it consistently produce this effect.

Another side effect of what is going on, is try/catch statements and
breakpoints do not work inside these threads.

I'm getting deeper into the project and have been able to dance around the
issue with writing to the Console, but it's becoming extremely vexing lately
and is wasting huge amounts of time for stuff that should be debugged fairly
quickly.

I just need to know why a crash happens or at least where.

If there are any pointers in helping me get crash reports, I'd be extremely
grateful. I would like to think my problem is coming from asynchronous calls
causing havoc, but I have done many tests to ensure that was not the case.
But even if it were asynchronous problems, I would still expect SOME sort of
feedback from a crash while in debug mode.

Thanks for your time on the matter.
