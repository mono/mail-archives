<PRE>I tried doing the same basic setup yesterday, but found that my projects were
setup to compile against .NET 4.0 and for MonoTouch they needed to be for
the iPhone, so I could see how to use the same project for both scenarios.  

To work around this I created the equivalent empty c# MonoTouch library
projects and then added files from folder, but then didn't move or copy but
used a link to the original files.  This way an edit from any of the
solutions will keep the code in sync because its the same file and the
different systems can build it they way they need.

Now to &quot;share&quot; a project between Mac and Windows I have my code in a Dropbox
share and I use the same logical projects.  I run Windows in a VM on my Mac
and can switch back and forth between the two even editing the same file
between the 2 envs and when I switch to the other it gets reloaded.  This
has been very helpful since MonoDevelop's code completion seems to be messed
up, I can switch to windows to make changes to the file I want, then switch
back to the mac to build and run.  Also the same &quot;logical&quot; project is being
used by both MonoDevelop and VS2010 so new files are added automatically.

By using the sym links, these new files need to be manually linked to the
MonoTouch projects if you go this route.

(Note I just started using MonoMac about 2 weeks ago and MonoTouch last
week, so there may be better ways to do what I just described)
