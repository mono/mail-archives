<PRE>No, but I can add to the rumors for free...

Apple supposedly notified a select group of devs about the tablet's  
announcement in January and its release in June or July. According to  
what I read (as always, not at my laptop, so can't get to my browser  
history to point you to this), the request was that these devs get  
started writing resolution-independent apps. The tablet mentioned in  
the post was dinky - seven inch screen, I think.

My dad called and asked about it yesterday, convinced it had already  
been announced (with projected sales figures, etc.). He's not a geek -  
he's a civilian - and his hearing about this made it all seem more  
legitimate to me. That's pretty wonky reasoning on my part, but this  
tablet bidness is either one of the biggest hoaxes in nerd history or  
it's actually happening.

If it's the latter, it's likely to be iPhone OS and ARM for the  
following reasons (basing this on rumors, the size of the screen, blah  
blah blah):

- iPhone OS is already very multitouch-happy.

- iPhone OS is built around connectivity. I assume Apple intends for  
people to use the thing as a portable, always on, always connected  
device, so, perhaps, remaining connected in part through a cell  
network (hopefully still ATT - it's been peaceful not being able to  
receive calls at home ever since I switched from T-Mobile).

- iPhone OS is already ARM-happy, and I'm guessing they aren't going  
to want to create any more divergence in the platforms (iPhone vs.  
tablet) than necessary.

- Existing OS X apps aren't multitouch-happy at all. There's some  
happy in the way the trackpad works, but the apps are still built  
around the assumption that you're moving a little arrow around the  
screen and clicking on little UI widgets with precision people are  
unlikely to reproduce with their fingers on a touchscreen (without a  
stylus, anyway).

- Most iPhone apps are already designed around the expectation that  
keyboard input is going to frustrate the user. I *love* the Windows  
tablets I've owned, but &quot;typing&quot; was a nightmare. I don't know how  
Apple would get around the problem, but one way to start is to provide  
users access to bajillions of apps that don't expect much typing to  
begin with.

- There are many more apps for the iPhone than OS X. Either that or  
the distribution model makes it appear that way. I'd expect Apple to  
want to take advantage of that - plus, Apple doesn't get a share of  
all the OS X apps sold in the traditional way. You know, where  
there's, like, a store that, you know, like, sells things... things  
that *aren't* just Apple products. Being able to reuse existing apps  
(either in some iPhone-like environment or apps that have been written  
to run on both devices) would give Apple a bajillion reasons to  
consumers to consider (finally) buying a tablet. It's always nice to  
have software to drive the hardware, and that's where MS's tablet  
bidniss failed people - most regular Windows apps just weren't  
comfortable to use.

So... not authoritative, but sensible.

Ish.

I think.
