<PRE>There's a post in the MonoTouch forums about another MT app in the store: <A HREF="http://forums.monotouch.net/yaf_postsm661.aspx">http://forums.monotouch.net/yaf_postsm661.aspx</A>

Here's the iTunes link for those of you who want go check it out: <A HREF="http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/knights-frenzy/id348732014?mt=8">http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/knights-frenzy/id348732014?mt=8</A>

That kind of thing is giddy-making - figured other people would want to know.

Some interesting things:

It's a game, so there are a bunch of custom UIs.
Despite being shipped with the media resources the game needs, the download package is only 6.7 MB.
It's using AdMob (I know there are people who've been having problems getting AdMob integration figured out).
It's stable (played the game for about fifteen minutes with no problems). Not saying it shouldn't be stable, but there are naysayers out there who trash MT for various uninformed reasons, and this is a nice you-can-shut-up-now sorta message :)
Good performance.

Best of all (I'm partial to this since one of the most ridiculous anti-MT arguments I've seen is that MT will fail because MT apps won't look or feel like &quot;real&quot; apps (they are real apps! (argh))), if you weren't a dev interested in this sort of thing, you'd have no reason to think the app was built with anything other than Apple's tools. It's not the best example of that on account of the custom UI, but it's clearly not a web app - it's a &quot;real&quot; iWhatever app. Which is what MT produces. Which is why that argument can be so irritating.

Sigh.

What can you do.

Except go around telling people they're wrong :)

Anyway, congrats to Logic for Data on the app.
