<PRE>I'm afraid that's not even authoritative. if you want something actually authoritative, you need to spend a lot more money than that to get insider info from manufacturers.

this is apple's MO.

Can anyone point at something authoritative on the iSlate that doesn't require me to spend $2/week to read it?

Well I don't think the tablet is speculation anymore, when even the Wall Street Journal writes about it:
<A HREF="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703580904574638630584151614.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703580904574638630584151614.html</A>

The questions that remain:
Will it feature an ARM or an Intel processor? Will it run Mac OS or iPhone OS?


This is the speculation I was referring to :)  Until we have more details we cannot speculate as to the feasability of bringing MonoTouch to the platform.

Its not fair to speculate at this time about what Apple may or may not release, however, we'd like to support as many devices as possible in MonoTouch.
