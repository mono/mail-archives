<PRE>I always feel bad about answering questions with questions, but are  
you sure this is what you want to be doing? Typically, you don't  
interact with the window much after it's been created and displayed.  
After MakeKeyAndVisible, you'd usually assign a view controller's view  
to the window.

Depending on how you're managing navigation in your app, you might end  
up having to reference the window again when removing one controller's  
view and adding the next, but the window's real purpose is to be the  
backdrop for everything else you do and will rarely end up in a state  
where it has no subviews.

What you've done so far, though, should be enough to accomplish what  
you're trying to do. If the subview you're removing is the only view  
you've directly added to the window (regardless of how many views you  
add to that topmost subview), then the window shouldn't have any  
subviews - an event is actually unnecessary.

To get events to notify you of views loading or unloading, as well as  
appearing and disappearing, you'd manage your views with controllers  
(the difference between &quot;loading&quot; and &quot;appearing&quot;: a view can be  
loaded into memory, but that doesn't mean it's been displayed - a view  
can also disappear from the screen without being unloaded from memory  
- there are separate events in view controllers to handle this (I  
don't remember if the MT event names map to the Objective-C names in  
this case, but it should be something like &quot;ViewDidLoad&quot;,  
&quot;ViewWillAppear&quot;, &quot;ViewDidAppear&quot;, and so on, along with corresponding  
events for views disappearing and unloading)).

Wish I were at my laptop - I'd send you a simple demo app. Let me know  
if that'd interest you and I'll post a link to one.

Point being, views themselves (UIWindow is a subclass of UIView)  
aren't meant to manage anything - they're meant to *be* managed, which  
is why you'll almost always want to have at least one view controller  
in your app.

I don't know what your programming background is, but this can be a  
little confusing at first - I promise it makes more sense as you  
experiment and progress :)

And, just in case it got lost in the stuff I wrote about controllers,  
I'll repeat the bit that (kind of) answers your question:

If the subview you're removing is the only view you've directly added  
to the window (regardless of how many views you add to that topmost  
subview), then the window shouldn't have any subviews - an event is  
actually unnecessary.

In other words, after removing the view you added to the window, you  
can expect the window to be back to its original state, so you don't  
need an event to notify you - after you call RemoveFromSuperview on  
your subview, you can proceed with the assumption that the window has  
no subviews. You can also check its Subviews property to be sure.

Hope this helps...
