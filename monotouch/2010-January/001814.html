<PRE>Thanks to Geoff Norton and other contributors, the sqlite-net project has
been updated with a variety of bug fixes. It is available from:
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/sqlite-net/">http://code.google.com/p/sqlite-net/</A>

For those unfamiliar, this was one of the early drivers for MonoTouch back
before we had the ADO.NET driver. Its design goal is to make DB access
simple.

I had let the project slide as I didn't think there was much point after the
ADO.NET driver was released. On reflection however, it's not 2002 anymore
and ADO.NET is feeling a bit crufty. So I have decided be a better
maintainer of this project. To that end:


   - A variety of outstanding bugs have been fixed (most importantly the
   memory corruption that resulted in AccessViolations and other exceptions)
   - A unit test suite is being incrementally built to test the engine
   - Features are being added to make working with the DB as painless as
   possible

If you have any suggestions or comments, please post to this thread or to
the project Issue system.

Thank you,

-Frank
