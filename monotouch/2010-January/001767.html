<PRE>Hi,

I've been working with MonoTouch and MonoDevelop for a few months (which has been great, I might add), and I recently switched to a new mac. Since migrating all of my files across I've been unable to debug on my phone (I can debug fine in the simulator). My project builds without any problems, but then throws this error:

Error 1: mtouch failed with no output (1)

My first thought was that it might be something to do with the certificates, provisioning profiles etc, so I've created a new signing certificate and provisioning profile, but it doesn't seem to make any difference. Another thing I've noticed is that under Project Options &gt; iPhone Bundle Signing &gt; Provisioning Profile, the drop down menu is greyed out, and there are no provisioning profiles listed. No matter how many times I create new provisioning profiles and install them, this doesn't seem to change. I've also tried reinstalling monotouch and monodevelop.

Does anyone know what the problem might be?

TIA,
Piers
</PRE>
