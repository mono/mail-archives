<PRE>I don't think that should matter, but I'm not an expert - I just stumbled across that fix in searching.  I placed those three arguments in the &quot;Additional mtouch arguments&quot; for my main application project, and my device-specific issues were resolved.

I hoped that might help you resolve your current situation, but it looks like it might be a different problem.

Regards,

Chris

Chris,
I did place it in there. The Twitterizer is a different project inside my solution, does this mether? Because those arguments didn't fix it for me, sadly.

Thanks for your help guys, hopefully we can find a solution that works!

Make sure you are in the correct screen (&quot;iPhone Build&quot; - not &quot;Compiler&quot;), and that you are entering into the field that has the label &quot;Additional mtouch arguments&quot;.


*         Project Options &gt; Build &gt; iPhone Build &gt; General tab &gt; Additional Options section &gt; Additional mtouch arguments

Thank you,

Chris
