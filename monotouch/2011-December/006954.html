<PRE>Hi all,

i'm using MD 2.6 for building iOS apps. When building against iOS SDK 4.3,
all works well. But when I compile against SDK 5.0 I get the below error
(using Mono 10.2.6 and Monotouch 5.0.2). As only SDK 5 apps are allowed in
the appstore, I cannot submit my app :(

In some places in the docs there are references to 'newer MD versions', but
nowhere I can find which versions the documenter has in mind. Upgrading to
MD 2.8 is not a short-term option because I use MD in combination with
Delphi Prism. So my main question is: should I be able to build against SDK
5 with MD2.6? Maybe I need to add a key myself to allow building as a
workaround?

I hope someone can give some pointers as I really want my app to the
appstore soon...

(PS the Delphi Prism guys say they don't do anything with the plists for
building, so it might be a compatibility issue between MD 2.6 and MT 5)...

Error - 10:23:00 AM - Error merging Info.plist
