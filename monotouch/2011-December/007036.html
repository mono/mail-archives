<PRE>Hi,

I keep my project files on a Windows network share so that I can do most of
my development using the Visual Studio 2010 IDE, and it works very well most
of the time.

However after the move to MonoDevelop 2.8 (at latest version 2.8.4.2) with
its XCode 4 integration I'm running into an annoying problem.

If I double click on an XIB in MonoDevelop to edit a UI in XCode, its hit or
miss whether MonoDevelop picks up the fact that I have finished in XCode and
updates itself with the changes.

I've tried
* Saving the file in XCode, then closing XCode, then clicking back on
MonoDevelop
* Saving the file in XCode, then just clicking back on MonoDevelop

Both approaches work about 1/2 the time, with MonoDevelop realizing that I'm
finished in XCode and updating itself to get my changes.  When it works
sometimes it updates immediately, sometimes if I wait 20 to 30 seconds it
will update itself.

But at least 1/2 the time it does nothing, it just sits there.   I can
continue working in MonoDevelop but any changes I made in XCode are lost.  
If I double click on the XIB to open XCode again it opens fine, but all my
changes are gone.

I'm assuming this is tied to my working on the files on a network share as I
could not find any other posts complaining about this.

Is there a way for force MonoDevelop to update itself when I'm finished in
XCode, or am I just doing something silly?

Any help would be greatly appreciated, its very frustrating!

Thanks,
Richard
