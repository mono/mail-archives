<PRE>I had previously tried to get the Wahoo Fitness ANT+ api working with
Monotouch but it appeared to have the dreaded THUMB issue.  Now that 5.1.1
is supposed to resolve that I went to try again.  Previously the API was
distributed as a static lib (.a file) but it is now a static framework.  I
have not seen any official docs on how to bind to a static framework.

I have seen another post that referes to using -F{Dir containing the
framework} and using -framework {static framework name}.  I guess I am
wondering if this is correct?

I am getting errors while building that appear to be related to the fact
that the static framework requires CoreBluetooth.  If I link SDK files only
with no build options to reference CoreBluetooth I get errors that some
symbols are missing.  If I try to include a -framework or -weak_framework
with CoreBluetooth I get an error that it can't find CoreBluetooth.  If I
dont link any assemblies I still get ld: framework not found CoreBluetooth.
This message shows up even though I do not reference the CoreBluetooth in my
build options which are as follows :
-v -v -v -cxx -gcc_flags &quot;-F${ProjectDir}/Lib -framework WFConnector 
-framework ExternalAccessory    -framework Security  -ObjC  -lstdc++
-all_load &quot;   

The framework I am trying to bind is the WFConnector.framework. Reading the
5.0 changes it appears that CoreBluetooth should be available, but it may
have something to do with me not setting up the WFConnector.framework
correctly. 

Any thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated.

Walt
