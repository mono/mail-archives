<PRE>Hello Everybody,

this is my first e-mail.

I'm working in a project of home automation.

Here's how I'm intending to make it work:

The APP starts and it'll have a button to load a XML file.
The XML will have information about the rooms in the house like &quot;Living Room, Dinning Room, Kitchen etc.&quot;, it'll also have the information about the equipments &quot;Home Theater, TV, Blu-Ray Player, etc. in this case with a relation with the room that they belong&quot; and so on with the IR, RS-232 cmds...
I'll install this app in different houses, so I intend just to change the XML file as the house changes.
I intend to generate the UI from the information of XML file. E.g. The house has only &quot;Living Room and Dinning Room&quot; So at the tabbar I'll just appear two tabs (Living and Dinning Room).
Here's the question's:

Is The way I'm planning to do my software allowed by Apple, or they are gonna reject my App?
Is it possible to just download the App from the App Store in the iOS of the customer, and change and load the XML file? I mean, there's a package in the .app file, is it possible to open it and change the .xml file inside it? And load the .xml file?
And the last one, for the advanced programmers:

Is it fully possible to change the UI as the XML information changes?
Do you recommend me some book to read about it? Cause, I was reading a lot of them, and I didn't find such a specific information.

Thanks in advance,

Lyniker Aoyagui
