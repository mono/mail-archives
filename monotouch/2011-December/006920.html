<PRE>So my rookie adventures continue&#8230; 

I have a large collection of C# library code for interacting with various
servers (SOAP/REST/weird proprietary HTML/XML protocols you don&#8217;t want to
know about) &#8211; I&#8217;d hoped since these are all strictly C# libraries with no UI
elements and most are in 2.0 (some 3.5) that I could just import the
projects from my snappy &#8220;Common&#8221; source folder where they sit and I could
include them in my MonoTouch solutions all nice and tidy.  Living the
code-reuse-cross-platform dream.

Apparently that&#8217;s not the case.  Unless I&#8217;m missing something?  I&#8217;ve found
various posts on forums and FAQ basically saying you need to manually copy
files from your libraries into new projects &#8211; which makes me a little sad
from an ongoing maintenance standpoint obviously (these libraries are in use
on other Windows projects after all).  

It&#8217;s odd because I can bring the project into MonoDevelop&#8217;s solution for my
example iPhone application and it does build (with a few bogus warnings) and
seems happy, but when I try and import that project as a reference I get the
dreaded &#8220;incompatible target framework&#8221; note.  As a test I took the files
from a library, dumped them directly into my iPhone sample application,
changed the namespace to match and presto, all worked dandy.

So is there some clean way to approach this without doing some ugly
copy/past/manual maintenance nightmare?  Since one of the lead off pitches
for this product is the code reuse story I&#8217;d have hoped this was a little
more slick&#8230;
