<PRE>I've been successfully attaching and debugging my app from the device up
until now. Everything was working fine until I built an IPA and tested it
for enterprise distribution.

Steps taken:
I built the IPA file for release and copied it to my web server.
I navigated to my web server within iPad, clicked my link which prompted me
to install the app as expected.
App installed fine and worked.
I removed the app from the iPad.
Made some code changes, reconnected to the USB and changed back to debug.
MonoTouch deployed the app to my iPad fine and then prompted to start the
app which I did.
MonoTouch sits there waiting and eventually times out.

I've tried deleting the app again, rebooting the iPad with no success. Any
ideas on how to fix this?
