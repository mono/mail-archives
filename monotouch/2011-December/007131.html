<PRE>Hello,

I recently had to install monotouch on a second mac and I'm running into a
problem.  I cant get my app to launch on the simulator. I get the same
results with a tiny test app so its not the app.  I am building for iOS 5
and targeting the iOS 5 simulator.  

The same app deploys and launches fine on my iOS 5 Devices ( iPad and iPhone
).

Here is what I see. The app builds fine, the application output window
appears and the simulator pops up.  But, there is no output in the app
output window and the app does not launch.  After a while a simulator dialog
appears and says:

       The simulated application quit.  Click Relaunch to try again.

Relaunching dosnt work. An application icon is not present on the simulator,
so I don't think the app ever gets transferred and installed on the
simulator.  I'm not seeing any other messages on the monotouch side. 

Is there somewhere else in monotouch I should look for errors?

Any ideas?

Thanks in advance.
