I have similar situation Core project with 300+ business-logic/model 
classes and utilities
written mostly for desktop apps (WF and WPF) in last 10 years.
Spent 3+ months (not 8hrs/day in total 40-60 hrs) splitting them across 
platforms
(mobile, RIA, desktop server-aspnet)...
Right now we have code base and can develop apps for

  * 3 mobile platforms
  * RIA silverlight
  * desktop WinForms, WPF
  * asp.net

Project linker in conjunction with some other VS tools can really make 
what you wish
a reality. I'm talking about VS tools because we are VS-centric and go 
over to Linux
or MacOS when majority of coding is done, just for UI and to see that 
solution is
not falling apart (supported/unsupported stuf: project types/APIs etc).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It&#8217;s odd because I can bring the project into MonoDevelop&#8217;s solution for my
</I>&gt;<i> example iPhone application and it does build (with a few bogus warnings) and
</I>&gt;<i> seems happy, but when I try and import that project as a reference I get the
</I>&gt;<i> dreaded &#8220;incompatible target framework&#8221; note.  As a test I took the files
</I>&gt;<i> from a library, dumped them directly into my iPhone sample application,
</I>&gt;<i> changed the namespace to match and presto, all worked dandy.
</I>Do not reference them as assemblies, link the code...
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So is there some clean way to approach this without doing some ugly
</I>&gt;<i> copy/past/manual maintenance nightmare?  Since one of the lead off pitches
</I>&gt;<i> for this product is the code reuse story I&#8217;d have hoped this was a little
</I>&gt;<i> more slick&#8230;
</I>M4A and MT + MonoDevelop are very slick... Everything we do on VS side 
with Project
Linker opened/rebuilt in MD (with tiniy issues) on windows, then 
reopened/rebuilt
again on Linux and/or MacOS after cp/sm-share/svn-push-pull.

It simply works. Another advantage of source-code-linking is that You 
have to rebuild
projects after switch to MD and this gives You insight and relations 
about Mono and
.net especially with newer features.... And if there are any bugs You 
can send them to
Xamarin guys...
