<PRE>Hi,

I think for the most part it is the same. For testing we have a 3G, 3GS, 4, 4S, iPod Touch and an iPad 2. Main issues I have are that the iPad is a bit more powerful than some other devices, and it seems to like dropping its wireless connection. The others all seem to behave the same, iOS differences aside.

My main concern with the iPod is that it's using wireless, which is generally fast and your internet connection more reliable than cellular. I have screen shots of speed tests on a 4S where I have 0.02 mbit/sec down and 0.00 mbit/sec up, and that's in Austin Texas! So if you rely on any network or internet access, be wary of that.

Subject: [MonoTouch] Testing iPhone apps on an iPod Touch - the same?

Hey guys &#8211; poking around and trying to get a definitive answer without much luck, figured I&#8217;d ask out here to see if anyone had any experience testing iPhone apps on an iPod Touch.

If my apps don&#8217;t need phone services, is it safe to assume testing on my iPod Touch is the same as if I had an iPhone handy?  Not keen on popping for an iPhone just for testing &#8211; if I can get away with using an iPod that&#8217;d be ideal.

It _seems_ like it should be the same &#8211; OS is identical, looks identical, most of the same (non call) features &#8211; but you know what they say about the difference between theory and practice &#8211; so I thought I&#8217;d check if there are any &#8220;burn spots&#8221; doing this.


Thanks.
