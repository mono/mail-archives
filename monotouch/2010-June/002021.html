AFAIK you are allowed to ask for a review.

And the rest is I guess a question of how you present it.

Something like

&gt;&gt;<i>Please let us know what you think about our app - so that we can make it better....
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i>To honor your work we ...PRICE... to avoid missuse ... TWITTERNAME....
</I>should be OK.

 

And I'm with you - to say something like &quot;for positive reviews we offer a price&quot; could be a problem.

But a request for a honest review is for sure OK (a lot of apps have this in their description / on their site).

And offering a price - as long as it is clear that this is not for &quot;payin good reviews&quot; should also be OK

Subject: [MonoTouch] app store ratings and reviews

Hi

We're being hammered in the appstore by one of our competitors. Their offering is blatant tripe and everytime they get a 5 star review, we get a 1 star rating. coincidence? I dont think so.

Anyway, we were thinking of offering our users a prize if they reviewed our app and left their twitter username as an incentive to get some honest reviews on our app.

We arent going to tell them to review positively - we just want some honest reviews on our app.

Is this even allowed? what's the deal with asking people to review your app?
