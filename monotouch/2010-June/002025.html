<PRE>Is it possible to create a custom UIView as a XIB in interface builder and then use that as the class for a UIView in Interface Builder?

I can do this in code by creating a class that inherits from : UIView, and then in IB i can drop a UIView onto the designer and set the class to my custom class and get it's functionality. However, i've never gotten this to work if i define the UIView in a xib. the UI never loads.

i've been told that this is possible by kangaroo (geoff), but i've never actually seen it working, and no one has ever shown it to work. i've sent people a test case and no one has gotten it to work that way.

so... is it possible? and if so, i want to see a working example.
