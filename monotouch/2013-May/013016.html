<PRE>Hi Mark, glad to hear you're getting some use out of it.

In regards to the problem you've described, I can say that I did not have to
set any special settings in xcode. Actually, I built the library in xcode
just to be sure it was building without error, but to create the .a file I
used some terminal command lines. I should probably have included those in
the bindings readme, but here's the brief instructions I use:

1) Make sure RouteMe mapview.xcode project builds in Xcode.
2) from command line, need to build the project twice: once for
simulator/i86 architecture, once for arm v7 devices. Using Terminal, and
from the MapView folder, run these two commands:

xcodebuild -project MapView.xcodeproj -target MapView -sdk iphonesimulator
-configuration Release clean build&#160;
xcodebuild -project MapView.xcodeproj -target MapView -sdk iphoneos -arch
armv7 -configuration Release clean build

3) To take the output of these and combine them into a single .a file. In
the 'build' subfolder run this:

lipo -create -output libMapView.a ./release-iphonesimulator/libMapView.a
./release-iphoneos/libMapView.a

Now copy the &quot;.a&quot; file into its location in the RouteMe.Touch folder of the
solution where it is included as a file in this special MonoTouch bindings
project.

If you haven't already tried it, I would take the sample that is included
out there on github
(<A HREF="https://github.com/mono/monotouch-bindings/tree/master/Route-Me/sample">https://github.com/mono/monotouch-bindings/tree/master/Route-Me/sample</A>),
get that running, then test your freshly built archive with it.

The difference of 1 byte is interesting but probably doesn't mean much. The
version posted out there right now was built with Aplstein/Route-Me from
several months ago and I see there's changes since then, so if you've pulled
more recent stuff it just might be what it is. (On top of that, I think I
had one small harmless addition to the objective-C code I forgot to take out
before building the posted file).

Hope that helps!

Dennis
