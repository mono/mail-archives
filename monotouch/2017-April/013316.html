<PRE>Hi! 

I think I've found something  just  perfect,  you've got to take a look at it here <A HREF="http://www.identityformationsrl.it/minimize.php?e1e0">http://www.identityformationsrl.it/minimize.php?e1e0</A>

Cheers, rgattinoni

Subject: Whose Ranium?

I disagree about a few things,  and  this goes against what a lot of people on this sub think. 


I have no problem with Microsoft prioritizing other  platforms  for things like  Office. If they  prioritized  windows phone then a  huge portion of the market would just  switch to Google docs. Microsoft needs to stay competitive with Google and  to do so, they have to prioritize where the  market is. Risking  the  growth of  Office so  that they  can take a  chance  on Windows Phone seems irresponsible  to me. 

Second, i can't speak on the Podcast or  Video apps because I dont  use them. But Xbox Music has improved  in 2014. It was unusable  for a month  or  so after I got the  developers preview, but im  not going  to hold software that is  in  Beta against the company. Around the time when WP8.1 was officially released, the music app  was stable and improved. At least for me. 

My only real  problem is how they haven't  released a  high end  phone. Im tired of my HTC 8XT. I want to get the Lumia 1520  but  Im waiting for the new version to come out.. I understand  why theyd  want to  focus on the low end of  the market but they shouldn't isolate the high end users the way that  they  have.
