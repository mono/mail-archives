<PRE>Ive been using Monodevelop for about 10 months now, and it just seems to be
getting worse and worse. 

The amount of obvious errors seen from using the program for about 10
minutes suggests there isnt any real formal testing performed on the
application. I understand that Mono is an open source initiative, however
Monotouch is not. Its $400 a year. Its the most money I spend on software,
certainly on a yearly basis. I dont think its fair to paying customers for
quality assurance to be so overlooked. Each time i mention a bug I get asked
to file a bug report. This would normally be fine, however Im a paying
customer. I feel like im doing more testing than the monodevelop testing
team, if such a thing even exists.

Im all for promoting Monotouch, but with the current state of Monodevelop,
the developers cant expect this Development framework to be taken seriously.

Sorry if this sounds like a rant. But i've been spending the last 20 minutes
trying to debug on my phone with no luck. Im sure you can appreciate my
frustration as I encounter a similar battle EACH and EVERY time I try to
debug my app. Each time, something different has happened. DWP Handshake
failed... Lost connection to device... flat out not connecting, debugging
stopping randomly, MonoDevelop &quot;Unhandled Exceptions&quot; when my own code hits
a bug, hiding the actualy bug in my code from being debugged, Monodevelop
fatal errors/crashes. Mixed in with that are glaring UI focusing bugs, and a
benign (but still a bug) case where my cursor turns into an &quot;upward&quot;
direction arrow.

Is the development team actively testing Monodevelop prior to release, or do
they just sit back and wait for the paying users* to report bugs for them?


*Im aware Monodevelop is free and used by free users, however it is the IDE
for Monotouch, which is paid for.
