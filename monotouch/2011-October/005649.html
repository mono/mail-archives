<PRE>&gt;<i> - As I have seen, the development of MonoTouch was formerly owned by Novell and is now under this new company, Xamarin. Looking at the time and license investment, how sure is it that MonoTouch will continue to live in the coming years? Would I be better off to invest this time into learning Obj-C?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Well, I think they are going to be going for a while, tho it's
impossible to know without a time machine and a copy of their
financials. However:

however, in their job ads: &quot;We sell a mobile platform that makes
building great apps much easier. We're 4 months old. We're more than
30 people. We have thousands of paying customers and we're already
profitable. We're pre-VC. We don&#8217;t have sales or marketing yet. In a
recent customer survey, 90% of paying customers said they would be
&quot;very disappointed&quot; if they could no longer use our product.&quot;

&gt;<i> - So far, I have read a bunch of articles and got myself the Apress book on MonoTouch. As I see, it doesn't target Xcode 4, Lion, etc&#8230; . What would be the best path for me to learn efficiently how to code using MonoTouch? (Read the book, get another one, read a website I'm not aware of at the moment, etc&#8230; ?)
</I>
Yes, it does. All the books are out of date :) (it would be hard not
to be out of date - it's moving VERY VERY quickly)

A lot of people (including me) are using it on Lion, with XCODE 4
(**cough** iOS5 GM SDK). XCode 4.x has worked with MT for a while, but
you need MonoDevelop 2.8 to use interface builder, which was released
last week. Personally, I dont use Interface Builder)

Personally, I'd write some code. Pick a small task - RSS reader is
good one :) - and write something. Or have a look around github for
other peoples code:
