<PRE>Hi,

Yeah, my guess would be that you're missing a Close/Dispose somewhere
(but I couldn't find anything missing in the case you showed). I
wouldn't look at the web services first, it's more likely a problem
with the code where you're using sockets and/or http requests
yourself.

</I>&gt;<i> More specifically:
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;filename unknown&gt;:0
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, I can trap for this. But the bigger issue is, once I get this error,

</I>&gt;<i> I restart the app.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could this be a case of me not disposing manually of some resource that I
