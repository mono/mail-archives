<PRE>Hi Michael,

That seems a very interesting approach!

Currently I have two separate projects within one solution, and both projects
have a 'Common' subdirectory with all common sources. I use a little perl script
to synchronize the sources. But I'll now move these common sources to a new
library project within this solution and go for your approach. Definitely
cleaner!

Thanx for the idea.
