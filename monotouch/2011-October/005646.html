<PRE>Hi Jowi,

On Sun, Oct 9, 2011 at 5:12 AM, jowi &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monotouch">j.wiersma17 at chello.nl</A>&gt; wrote:

The IntPtr ctor should only ever be called if the instance was
allocated in Objective-C and then C# got a handle to it via a callback
or something.

At least that is my understanding...

</I>
We have some free documentation on our website which is continuing to
expand thanks to the efforts of Bryan Costanich, Michael Bluestein,
Chris Hardy and others (who's names you might recognize as the authors
of some of the MonoTouch books out there).

The tutorials on our documentation site are geared towards MonoDevelop
2.8 and Xcode4, so that might be extremely useful to you.

You can find this documentation here: <A HREF="http://docs.xamarin.com/ios">http://docs.xamarin.com/ios</A>

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Positive remark is that monotouch is definitly evolving and growing, if you
</I>&gt;<i> buy some books and there outdated before you finished them, you're on the
</I>&gt;<i> edge of technology hehe ;)
</I>
Definitely! There is, unfortunately, a rough patch for those
transitioning to MonoDevelop 2.8, but hopefully the documentation we
provide will help a lot!

(we've also got tutorials for people used to MonoDevelop 2.4/2.6 and
Xcode 3 who are trying to move to MD 2.8 and Xcode 4)

Good luck and happy hacking!

Jeff
