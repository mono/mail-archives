<PRE>Hi, 

I am trying to link a C library into a large MonoTouch application and have
been met with some trouble... Anytime I run the app I get:

The assembly mscorlib.dll was not found or could not be loaded.
It should have been installed in the
`/Developer/MonoTouch/Build/simulator/lib/mono/2.0/mscorlib.dll' directory.

I created a very simple C library (one function), and a simple test app in
MT-- (it just calls the C function), and this works as expected...

But in my actual application, with my actual library. nothing works. If I
remove the C library from linking, the mscorlib error does not occur.

I am also able to link the C library into an Obj-C iPhone app and use it
successfully. 

Can anyone speculate how linking a C library might cause this error?

Have the latest version of everything (MonoTouch  5.0, MonoDev 2.8.1,  XCode
4.2).

Thanks,
Ogden
