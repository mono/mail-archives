<PRE>Yes, good advice and that's what I was going for anyway: code something that
is in a &quot;releasable state&quot; and then buy a license. 

But it's not really the price of the MT license that worries me... ...it's
the time I'll need to learn (I work 50% in a trading company as a software
coder and the other 50% for a gaming company also as a coder... ...both of
them being fast moving businesses, I have very little time to invest in my
learning or my kids will not like it very much :-D). I'm looking for the
most efficient way and from what I've seen, so far, the tutorials offered on
the website are a bit light (or at least for me, as I'm a bit slow and
couldn't figure out the MVC by myself using them), considering there is no
up-to-date literature on MT.
