<PRE>Hey Nic, thanks for the info. Very helpful (and I'm a Nic too, btw).

Yep, I understand we can't predict the future but I wanted to have a general
feel of the direction Xamarin is going. I don't think MT will abruptly
disappear either but one never knows, I have invested so much in the past on
technologies that didn't have a future... :-)

I think I see how I will get into learning MT as there doesn't seem to be a
formal path to it (like &quot;read this book&quot;) but there's still one topic that I
can't figure out: the MVC. This is so different than WPF and ASP.NET, I'm
totally lost with these ViewController things... Maybe I can leverage that
from my (bought yesterday and already) outdated MT Apress book.

Have a great day,

Nico
