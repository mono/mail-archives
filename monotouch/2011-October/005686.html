<PRE>Hi Joseph,

We checked no other application using the 10001 port and we tried  to clean and build the solution, but we faced same error.
After that , we again re-installed XCODE 4.1 , MonoTouch: 4.0.4.1 and  MonoDevelop: 2.8 Beta version. But still we
got the same error.

Please advise us some other solutions that will help us to do the continue work.

Thanks,
Jitendra Kumar Pal

Hello Jitendra
We've had a few people report this problem, but no one has supplied enough information back to nail down the root cause:
<A HREF="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7582327/socket-error-in-monotouch-4-2-monodevelop-2-8">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7582327/socket-error-in-monotouch-4-2-monodevelop-2-8</A>

From the link above:
The application tries to establish a connection to MonoDevelop (so that you can debug the application), and for some reason it fails. Do you have any other programs using port 10001? (running &quot;netstat -n -t tcp | grep 10001&quot; from a terminal will show you) You can also try a full clean and rebuild of your application.

Can you please let me know if you find out that another application is running on 10001, or if you are able to debug after doing a clean / rebuild?

Thank you
Joseph

Hi Joseph,

Thanks for your responses,

We had try to run our application with simulator(iPhone 4.3). But we are getting error (&quot;Socket error while connecting to 127.0.0.1 on port 10001: Connection refused&quot;) in application output window.
Please help us regarding this issue.

Thanks,

Hello Jitendra
To design UIs with Xcode4, you will need to migrate to MonoDevelop 2.8. MonoDevelop 2.4 and 2.6 only supported the Interface Builder tool from Xcode3.

MonoDevelop 2.8 is currently in beta, but the final release is probably only a few days away. You can download MonoDevelop 2.8 beta 3 from here:
<A HREF="http://monodevelop.com/Download">http://monodevelop.com/Download</A>

Do you still need a phone call to discuss this? I am not in the office, but you can call me directly on my mobile, 214.500.3649; however, I will be heading into meetings in about 30 minutes, so it might be better to set up a time to discuss this afternoon, or later in the week.

Thank you

Hello Jitendra
No, we do not have any products for targeting BlackBerry, and do not currently have any planned.

We may revisit the request for BlackBerry support once we're sure we are delivering a rock-solid experience iOS and Android. Realistically, this is probably not something we'll be able to support in the next year.

Thank you

Hello Jitendra
This will support the current MonoTouch release. You can download the trial here to confirm:
<A HREF="http://xamarin.com/trial">http://xamarin.com/trial</A>

Our support for Xcode 3.2.6 is very solid, and we are in no rush to drop it. Eventually, this will happen because Apple has already dropped support for 10.5 in Xcode 4; however, you should be fine for awhile. At some point, Apple will release a version of iOS that requires Xcode 4, and at that point we will also be unable to support Xcode 3.2.6.

Please note: I have removed the public mailing lists from the CC on this email. Can you please ensure that you drop the pucli CC's on our future discussion?

Thank you
Joseph

Hello Jitendra
Thanks for your interest in MonoTouch.

MonoTouch does not run on Windows, as it requires Apple's iOS SDK. The minimum requirements are the same as Apple's SDK - an Intel-based Mac running OS X 10.6 or later.

Hope that helps. Please let us know if you have any additional questions.

Thank you
Joseph

Hi Support team,

Please give me brief details for below questions.

Question1 - Please give the details regarding total number applications, we can deploy as we buy professional ($399) Monotouch licensed for IOS system?

Question2 - Can we deploy multiple versions of same application into a physical device, does it consider each version number as one application or all versions are considered as one application?
