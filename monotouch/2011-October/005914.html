<PRE>Hi,

Project configuration file changed when upgraded to MD 2.8 last week, since
the project was migrated and some things was made by MonoDevelop. But, due
to your help, I saw (and remembered that there were) differences between
release and debug..:

Release:
- Use LLVM optimizing compiler: enabled

Debug:
- Use LLVM optimizing compiler: disabled

I don't changed that recently, I think that changed that 2 months ago, with
old MD and MT.

Changing release to &quot;Use LLVM optimizing compiler: disabled&quot; solved the
problem. Also changing &quot;No link&quot; to &quot;Link SDK assemblies only&quot; reduces size
from 38MB to 13.2 MB.

Thanks Sebastien for your help :) And I didn't compare performance benefits
between LLVM or not LLVM in the past months due to lack of time&#138;

Karl

Hello Karl,

You should first compare the project options (e.g. defines) between
your Debug and Release configurations. One might have received updates
(e.g. Debug) when developing while the other (e.g. Release) could have
bitrotten a bit.

Next the crash includes everything about the crash but sometimes lacks
the pre-condition(s) that triggered it.

a) start a terminal window
b) execute the following command: &quot;/Developer/MonoTouch/usr/bin/mtouch
--logdev&quot; (without the quotes)
c) start your application of the device and make it crash
d) copy/paste the console log into your reply email (or better a bug
report).


Regards,
Sebastien
