<PRE>Harsh dude, harsh!

I've been using MonoDevelop/touch for 3-4 mths now and I've been through
some pain with the combo, particularly when I upgraded to Lion in the first
week, but things have been resolved extremely efficiently.   Support has
been awesome and they've kept up the releases and with ios5 etc despite all
losing their jobs earlier this year!

Agreed, I've never spent so much on licenses either, but objective c is your
alternative.  Think about it.  Not saying your wrong as I've felt the pain
too, bu the support is awesome and xamarin have pulled out all the stops.  
What I'd agree with you on is that maybe a bit more reliability, robustness
and less following the curve might be the order of the day for the next few
months.   USB debugging seems to be an issue for a few, me I love it!!
