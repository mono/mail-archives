<PRE>Basically, the touch event on screen fires an event, which calls the code to send the TCP-IP message on a separate thread. There's error trapping in every function to hide the UIAlertView regardless of what happens - but it seems the TcpClient send method doesn't return until the phone is dropped - this is the only way the UIAlertView can't be hidden. If it returned, the UIAlertView would have been hidden.

But it's not consistent - it works perfectly 99% of the time, the other 1% of the time a drop makes it work.

And yeah. I'm trying to explain this to my CEO. Not going well.

I didn't believe it, but I have seen a video of it as proof...

I have some code that sends a TCP-IP message. It pops a UIAlertView with no buttons and an activity indicator to show that something is happening. 99% of the time, it's gone in 1 to 5 seconds, but sometimes it takes longer - a lot longer.

What's on the video is apparently reproducible, although to produce a sample will be night on impossible - but if it takes ages (like 1 or more minutes) they just drop the phone onto the desk (from about 6&quot; to 12&quot; high) and magically it hides the indicator and the app carries on perfectly. Every time they do it regardless of waiting 30 seconds or 3 minutes, it *ALWAYS* works the instant they drop it.

Likely the accelerometer detects the motion and posts a message to your run loop that says &quot;Device is being shaken&quot; (you have seen this in text fields, when you shake you get a &quot;Undo Typing&quot; button).

Probably the message posted to the main loop is unblocking whatever pending operation is queued, even if nothing happens on the screen.

Hard to diagnose without looking at the code.
