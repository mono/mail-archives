<PRE>I'm new to MonoTouch (I finally purchased an Enterprise license this morning)
and I've been really enjoying working with it. However.. I've just hit my
first problem:

I have a added a MonoTouch Library Project to my solution, and all of my
data access logic is contained within in. I've added a reference to this
project to my main application project. The trouble is, MonoDevelop (I
assume?) doesn't seem to know about it. I have no intellisense for the
classes contained within it, and functions such as &quot;Resolve&quot; on the classes
contained within the library don't work. If I manually add in the &quot;using&quot;
statement for my library's namespace, the solution compiles. However, if I
use the &quot;Remove unused usings&quot; option, it removes the entry for my library,
even though I have code that is using it! It's as if it simply doesn't know
the library exists.

Any ideas? Am I missing something, or doing something wrong?

Thanks
