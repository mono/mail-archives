<PRE>I had problems debugging with all versions of MonoDevelop 2.8 (and MonoTouch
4.9.6+). Since I had 3 different versions of Xcode installed, I thought I'd
wait for the final release of iOS SDK so that I could try on a &quot;cleaner&quot;
machine.

After some tests with 3 different devices (iPad iOS 5, iPhone 3GS iOS 5 and
iPhone 4 iOS 4.3.5), I noticed that if iTunes is open and syncing with a
device (both on wifi and USB, but not at the same time) and *after* syncing,
my app could never connect to the debugger. Even if the particular device
was ejected from iTunes. Even after syncing of the other device was
completed.

But, when I close iTunes, it all works ok! Open iTunes again, once more,
everything ok! Sync a device and wait for it to complete... debugging breaks
again!

It would be great if someone else could confirm this, just to make sure
there is nothing wrong with my Mac, or even help Xamarin fixing it, if there
is something to fix.
