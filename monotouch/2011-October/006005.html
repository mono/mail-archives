<PRE>The main thing for me is the debugging. Trying to get the debugger to attach
to my app on the device is very hit and miss. Its what slows me down the
most.
Generally it starts off with the debugger completely ignoring the fact my
app launched on the device, and the device vibrating once to show its not
connected to debugger.
Usually I try:

ReUpload to device
Disconnect/Reconnect device
Rebuild and reupload.
Manually kill my app and try
Delete app from device and reupload
Reset device
Restart Monodevelop.
Restart computer.

This evening was one of those evenings where I could only get it to work
after doing ALL of the above.
I finally got it connected after restarting computer, device and rebuilding
and reconnecting all in one go, and then Monodevelop crashes out completely. 
After another 5 - 10 minutes I get it connected again, am debugging through
my code, hit &quot;step over&quot; for the 10th to 15th time maybe during the
debugging session, and it never makes it to the next line. So have to
disconnect and go through all of the above again to try get back to that
point in the code.

40 minutes later and i finally get to debug that line. You can imagine how
annoying this might get.

There are the other errors, UI bugs, random crashes, unhandled exceptions
etc... but honestly if the debugging could just be fixed id be sane again.
