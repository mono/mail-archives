<PRE>Thank you for your reply.

I have gone through all of the tutorials on the site (as basic as they are),
and they have been helpful. 

I guess Im just generally confused here (coming from
Silverlight/Blend/VS2010) in this new environment, so let me ask some direct
questions, if you don't mind.

First, Ive downloaded a few example projects. In most (if not all) of them,
I open the XIB file in IB and notice 2 things that confuse me. The first
being theres an App Delegate object at the top of Objects in the Document
Inspector part of IB. This does not seem to be created when i create a new
XIB in MonoDevelop. However, if I drag a generic object and change its class
to AppDelegate, I get the same looking thing... however, the example
projects Ive seen have a Reference Outlet to File's Owner as a delegate, Im
not able in my own project to make that connection... and am not sure if
thats just legacy stuff what... 

Another difference Im experiencing is that a MonoTouch project creates a
View as the top of the hierarchy, whereas the sample projects are using a
Window as the top level object. 

Its very possible, that Im highly confused at the most basic level. I just
really want to work past this basic and move on to the important part of UI
building, but I seem to be stuck.

Thank you for your patience.... very new in all ways to iOS and Macs.
Brad
