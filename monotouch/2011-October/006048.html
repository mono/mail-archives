<PRE>I pay $2500/year for visual studio which has crashed about the same number of
times as monodevelop since I started using it 3 months ago. 

I pay $1500/year for one windows/asp.net component suite and filing bugs
with the vendor results in them telling us that the obviously broken control
behavior is by design after &quot;analyzing&quot; the issue for 2 months. The first
and only bug I have filed with monotouch/monodevelop had a workaround in &lt; 2
hours and a permanent fix in &lt; 24 hours.

We were able to convert more than 500,000 LOC from an existing Windows
tablet app written in VB to monotouch in 3 months and now have customers
lining up at the door for the iPad version.

Yes there are some issues and I would be happy to have more third party
controls and suites to choose from, but overall, monodevelop and monotouch
are absolute steals and incredibly well supported.
