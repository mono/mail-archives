<PRE>I had this exact same issue and through a process of elimination, finally
figured out the cause. 

My views that were created prior to 2.8 had an outlet for the View called
view. When I opened the header file, I discovered that XCode was complaining
that declaration for the view was a duplicate name.

Since this seemed like it could be the source of the problem, I took the
following steps:

1) Deleted the view outlet in the file owner's list of outlets

2) Manually removed the two references to view in the header file

3) Linked the View outlet in the file owner's list of outlets directly to
the view (I did not drag the connection to the header file, I dragged it to
the view that is on left-hand side of the designer area). If you forget to
do this step, you will receive a runtime error about the nib being loaded
but the view outlet not being sent.

Hopefully this will help resolve someone else's problems as well.
