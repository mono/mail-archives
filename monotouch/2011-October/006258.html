Brad,
What you are running into is that Apple changed things between iOS4 and iOS5.  My book is based on iOS3 (but still pretty accurate).  Mike and Bryan's books are based on iOS4(even more accurate).  Apple recently changed things in iOS5 and XCode 4.x.  I've got about 25 training based projects I have to go through to update, not looking forward to this.  I've been building my iOS5 apps so far starting as iOS5 projects in MD 2.8.  I just started the update process on Friday, but it looks like a project built for iOS5 doesn't like the window as the top level object since the emulator seems to complain about not having a root view controller (or something like that).  If I understand the changes correctly, I think its good, but painful for some of us.
Wally

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your reply.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have gone through all of the tutorials on the site (as basic as they are),
</I>&gt;<i> and they have been helpful. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I guess Im just generally confused here (coming from
</I>&gt;<i> Silverlight/Blend/VS2010) in this new environment, so let me ask some direct
</I>&gt;<i> questions, if you don't mind.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First, Ive downloaded a few example projects. In most (if not all) of them,
</I>&gt;<i> I open the XIB file in IB and notice 2 things that confuse me. The first
</I>&gt;<i> being theres an App Delegate object at the top of Objects in the Document
</I>&gt;<i> Inspector part of IB. This does not seem to be created when i create a new
</I>&gt;<i> XIB in MonoDevelop. However, if I drag a generic object and change its class
</I>&gt;<i> to AppDelegate, I get the same looking thing... however, the example
</I>&gt;<i> projects Ive seen have a Reference Outlet to File's Owner as a delegate, Im
</I>&gt;<i> not able in my own project to make that connection... and am not sure if
</I>&gt;<i> thats just legacy stuff what... 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another difference Im experiencing is that a MonoTouch project creates a
</I>&gt;<i> View as the top of the hierarchy, whereas the sample projects are using a
</I>&gt;<i> Window as the top level object. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Its very possible, that Im highly confused at the most basic level. I just
</I>&gt;<i> really want to work past this basic and move on to the important part of UI
</I>&gt;<i> building, but I seem to be stuck.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your patience.... very new in all ways to iOS and Macs.
</I>&gt;<i> Brad
