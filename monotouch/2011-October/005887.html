<PRE>I am working at an app that will be available in two versions, one is
with advertisements, the other is without advertisements. The first one
is to be called MyApp, the second one MyAppPro.

The only difference between the two is the fact that their appname is
different and that the compiler symbols are different for the two
targets. That's how I enable or disable advertisements.

If I understand it correctly, the 'Build.iPhone Application' panel is not
configuration dependent, so I can't use extra configurations to define MyAppPro.

The 'Build.Output' panel allows for different output paths, so there
extra configurations would help. But alas, no way to define two
different target apps (I used to do this in xcode).

But I may well be overlooking built-in MonoDevelop capabilities.

I could create a MyAppPro directory whith its own csproj file but for
the rest just symlinks to all files and subdirs of the MyApp dir. That
would work but it is a clumsy solution and requires manual
synchronisation for project file ceration and deletion activities. I
would like to avoid this.

Please advise about the best way to achieve this.

TIA,

Guido
