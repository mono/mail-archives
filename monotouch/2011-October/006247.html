<PRE>Hey,

    ViewController containment is a new feature in iOS5, it did not exist
previously.

    They fixed their own series of hacks with this feature.

Miguel

Alright, so those eggshells could be what I am currently experiencing then
&gt;<i> with my random crashes. Sigh. I just cannot switch to ios 5 yet, that's the
</I>&gt;<i> drama.
</I>&gt;<i> And is the containment stuff really new or has it just been opened to the
</I>&gt;<i> public?
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But why would Apple then open up the API for view controller containmant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (Episode 102 of WWDC 2011)? If I rewrite MTSplitViewController to work on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> iOS5 only by using this new technique, what would be the advantages?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The original model was always a bit promiscuous.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The way that a view controller would be made active was not by stating
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;This is the view controller that is active&quot;, but instead by extracting the
</I>&gt;<i> toplevel view of the view controller and adding it to the hierarchy of
</I>&gt;<i> another view (Window typically).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This was always a little bit gross.   But not only it was gross, it also
</I>&gt;<i> happened that if you did this incorrectly, or swapped elements, or in
</I>&gt;<i> general did anything that UIKit was not prepared for, you would have random
</I>&gt;<i> crashes in some cases, and a very frustrating debugging experience.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The new APIs introduce the actual rules for implementing a view controller
</I>&gt;<i> hand-off, and in particular, it covers things like &quot;THis view controller is
</I>&gt;<i> no longer active&quot;, which has always been a source of questions and unsolved
</I>&gt;<i> problems (Like 'When is it safe to unload my cached images?').
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or asked differently: what issues can one expect with the current
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementation? As far as I can see, everybody is happy with Matt's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MGSplitViewController.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They are, they are just walking on eggshells, so if something goes wrong
</I>&gt;<i> with complex hierarchies, it is hard to figure out why.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The new model solves this.
</I>&gt;<i>
