<PRE>Hi all,

For some time now, I have been to wrap my head around Obj-C with no real success. Being a C#
 coder, I have to say that I'm pretty excited to have discovered to possibilities offered by MonoTouch. Still, before I invest some time into it, I would like to know a bit more about it:

- As I have seen, the development of MonoTouch was formerly owned by Novell and is now under this new company, Xamarin. Looking at the time and license investment, how sure is it that MonoTouch will continue to live in the coming years? Would I be better off to invest this time into learning Obj-C?

- So far, I have read a bunch of articles and got myself the Apress book on MonoTouch. As I see, it doesn't target Xcode 4, Lion, etc&#8230; . What would be the best path for me to learn efficiently how to code using MonoTouch? (Read the book, get another one, read a website I'm not aware of at the moment, etc&#8230; ?)

Thank you for your time and happy coding,

Nico
