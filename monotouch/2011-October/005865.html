I think you need to do -framework CoreGraphics -framework CoreLocation
-framework CoreData ...

but I could be wrong...

Also, CoreAnimation is actually from the QuartzCore framework.

Looks like you also need -lsqlite3

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> feeling thats not the correct syntax. Ive also tried placing &quot;-framework&quot; in

</I>
heh, that was the suggestion I was going to make.

try also replacing &quot;-framework CoreAnimation&quot; with &quot;-framework QuartzCore&quot;

although,

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, im pretty sure the API Definition is ok, but I have included it at
</I>&gt;<i> the end of this message just in case.
</I>
As you've determined, it's gotta be something not quite right with the
-gcc_flags argument.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If anyone can assist id greatly appreciate it, and will of course, make the
</I>&gt;<i> bump API available for everyone.. if I ever get it working! :-)
</I>
Hopefully my above suggestions fix it, if not, I should be at the
office in front of my Mac by the time you reply so I'll better be able
to look things over :-)

Jeff
