Subject: Or they're fatties

Dude, your mom knew, already. She  was  being politic and  helping  you save face, but, and I say  this with the full retrospection of a 36-year-old man with kids on their way up,  she *knows* how much you're shaking  the turtle, and she **doesn't  care**.


That's  not to say you shouldn't keep it  on the  DL, right?  Maybe pick up a little more (it stinks. If  you're caching that much come in  your room,  people know), close  your door,  etc., but  any parent of a 16-yo boy who thinks *their* precious little angel  isn't blowing the pope's  nose on a regular basis  is a  deluded individual.

So, be thankful that your mother was  kind enough  to  save  your slovenly ass as much embarrassment  as possible by code-wording it, maybe  make it a habit of wanking in the shower instead of  your room (or at  least take out the trash occasionally), and move  on.

Also, and this is a  100
