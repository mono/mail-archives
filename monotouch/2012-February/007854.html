Hi everyone.  I need your help in promoting my articles on MonoTouch at DevProConnections magazine.  In January, they published 2 articles on their site that I wrote and are listed below.  I'm not spamming you trying to get you to look at the articles, but need your help in getting the word out about these articles.  Blog entries, twitter posts, facebook, whatever you can do to help me out is greatly appreciated.  I'm trying to increase the pageviews on each article (I don't make any more money on whether or not you look at them).  The page views on the articles are only ok on the stats, and I would like to improve them so that DPC would want more of these and help Xamarin get their story about about MonoTouch.  Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.

Articles:Mobile
phones are by definition, mobile. A couple of interesting questions that come
up when users are mobile are, &quot;What's around me for dinner?&quot; and
&quot;Where can I get gasoline?&quot; If you are a retailer or a company, you
want to tell potential customers that there is a retail location near them. If
you are a user, you might also be interested in learning about how to go from
where you are to a specific address. In this article we'll look at these and
associated features, so that we can provide them to users via mapping and
location services to users in iOS apps.

Data is what makes applications go. It could be a
Twitter search, a running game score where you are playing against your
friends, sales data, or any other type of data that users want to base
decisions on. In this article, we're going to look at presenting tabular data
to users in a UITableView. The UITableView has a number of visually attractive
default styles that you can use. After we're done looking at these, we'll look
at creating a custom UITableView layout. Along the journey, we'll look at some
optimizations we can do that will give the user an improved experience. After
we're done with this, we'll look at some strategies to get at various data
sources, such as Representational State Transfer (REST), Windows Communication
Foundation (WCF), SQL Server, and the on-board SQLite database.
