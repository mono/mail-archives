I wouldn't worry.

If it's trying to reach a server, the thread isn't actually doing anything
at all, it just sits there, waiting (which can hardly be defined as &quot;hefty
work&quot;).

If you are really doing hefty work, it'll be in your code and you can quite
easily cancel it within a few seconds yourself.

It wouldn't be a problem unless you'd have several threads consuming all
available cpu at the same time, and if each thread is cancelled within a
reasonable amount of time (even 5-10 seconds would do), I can't see how the
user would run into problems unless he is actually stress-testing the
application.
