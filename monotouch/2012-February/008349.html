<PRE>Mine is a lot better than it was. Occasionally (maybe 1 in every 6-10 debug
sessions) when its loading the libraries in my project for debugging,  it'll
stop on Apollo.exe (apollo being the name of my main app exe). I have to
stop and restart debugging, or maybe redeploy to device to get it working.

Also having another problem im currently trying to assist the xamarin guys
pin down where I change devices between debug sessions and I get a strange
error about not being able to read an xml file.

However, its about 100 times better than it used to be for me. One thing I
noticed at one point is if you have dodgy code in your FinishedLaunching
delegate, it can stop the debugger connecting properly for some reason.
Maybe something like updating the UI from another thread, or some kind of
deadlocking situation between threads. (the latter was a bug in my code I
was tearing my hair out for about 3 or 4 days a few months back, thinking
there was a regression bug in the latest release of monotouch/develop!)
