<PRE>I think there is a lot of application in that way. Maybe the only
disadvantage is to be ad hands of Apple to approve, ant wait about 4 or 5
days to appear each new version.. Also in a emergency need to update for a
critical bug non discovered before publishing&#138; it's happens&#138;

But is more cheap and do not depend on client to get a development
enterprise account.

Or.. Each client get this&#138; We have 2 cases here that both companies get
enterprise from apple, and we're managing that for them&#138; But in our case,we
have a windows mobile application ported to iOs, the same application for
both clients, changing configurable rules.. If at morning a bugged version
is published, and 3 hours ago a problem is seen&#138; web can update it as it's
corrected. The application detects that has a new version and makes the
update withou to need to click on a icon or link on AppStore&#138;.

So two valid ways to do it&#138;

Subject:  [MonoTouch] Enterprise deployment or free app?

I'd appreciate peoples' views/experience in the light of what we need to
achieve for one of our customers.

We have an application which we are porting to iOS for one of our customers.
It's the handheld component of a bespoke management system which is licensed
to  /their/ customers and as such won't work with a valid logon to a central
server. This logon etc. is managed by us completely separately from the
handheld application.

I'm trying to work out whether we need to or should be deploying this as an
enterprise application. I have a feeling we shouldn't as we won't
necessarily have control over the devices they're using.

In fact, looking at the terms and conditions of enterprise deployment,
seeing as the application will be used by our customer's customers (i.e. not
internally), we /can't/ use enterprise deployment.

Therefore the option I see is to make the application free and generally
available on the AppStore, but will only work using correct logon
credentials.

The app would therefore appear on the store as something like
&quot;AcmeAssetManager&quot; with a description of &quot;iPhone application for mobile
management of assets using the Acme Asset Manager system&quot;. Obviously, Acme
here in place of our customer, and &quot;Asset Manager&quot; in place of the system
name!

If we do this then we may also have an opportunity for the free app to
operate in demo mode for non-authorised users, and therefore act as a
marketing tool for the service. The service is pretty specialised (can't
give details here), but this could still be useful.

Does this sound like a reasonable approach? Can anyone see pitfalls with
this?

Thanks a lot,

James
