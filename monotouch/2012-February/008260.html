Here's an update, using the project I have that currently has the missing .h
file problem. 

I tried quitting MonoDevelop and Xcode and deleting the obj folder from my
project, then relaunching MonoDev, double-clicking that project's lone
ViewController's xib file to launch Xcode (while giving Xcode plenty of time
to load or process anything it needed to handle). Once again, though, no .h
file -- &quot;No Assistant Results&quot;.

So then I copied the code from my ViewController file (and stuck it in a
different code editor) and deleted the ViewController files (the .cs,
.designer.cs, and .xib) from within MonoDevelop. Then I used the Add File
option to create a new iPhone ViewController file. I deleted the text from
that ViewController.cs file and pasted in my previous code, then
double-clicked the xib file to launch Xcode. Once again, no .h file, &quot;No
Assistant Results&quot;. 

Just for grins (and because I started in QA), I closed Xcode, went back to
MonoDev, and deleted the ViewController files again. Then I used Add File to
create a new set of ViewController files again. This time I didn't replace
the auto-generated code in the ViewController.cs file. I double-clicked the
xib, launched Xcode, and lo! There was a ViewController.h file! So I added
an MKMapView object to the GUI and ctrl+dragged it onto the .h file to
create an outlet. Saved it, quit Xcode, and went back to MonoDevelop. 

Then I copy and pasted my old ViewController code into the Viewcontroller.cs
file, replacing the auto-generated code that was there. Double-clicked the
xib file, launched Xcode, and there was my MKMapView object. I clicked on
the Assistant Editor button, and...no .h file. &quot;No Assistant Results&quot;. The
file is not in the project tree. 

Jeff, I'll attach the latest log file generated after this latest round of
testing to the bug in BugZilla. Let me know if there's anything else you
want me to try with this project.
