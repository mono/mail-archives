<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Last august I upgraded to MD 2.8 and monotouch 4.1  I had tremendous
difficulty with some parts of my code 

Even stuff lifted straight from guide books because the new set up seem ed
to handle things differently 

I reverted to MD 2.6 and monotouch 4.04 and got back my position 

I've left it for quite a while and now have to get back to MonoTouch
development -

 

MD now reminds me there are three upgrades (stable) available - I have
upgraded to MD 2.8.6.4

And Mono 10 something

Everything functions so far 

 

I have resisted upgrading to monotouch 5.2.3 because of last August's
disasters and time waste.

 

My question is - if I upgrade to Monotouch 5.2.3 will all these problems
reappear? i.e. code written for 4.04 simply did not function with little or
no help in the debugger. I know there are new ways of doing things with xib
files and whilst we must all move on I am so under time pressure I haven't
got time to get on a learning curve right now.

Will my 4.04 code work with 5.2.3 ? I really should have a second AppleMac
which I can try 5.2.3 on but I don't so installing it and finding it demands
a load of changes is not appealing 

Any advice gratefully received 

John Murray
