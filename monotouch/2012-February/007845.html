<PRE>Hello MonoTouch developers,

We have been developing a social network app for the iPhone, and now we're
reaching out to the MonoTouch developer community to find an experienced
developer who would like to help us get it finished and submitted to the
app store.

To get a sense of what the app is about, here is a placeholder promo page
for it:
<A HREF="http://www.tennyeats.com/">http://www.tennyeats.com/</A>

In terms of development hours, the app is roughly 3-4 weeks away from being
ready to be submitted to Apple for approval.

The cloud-hosted backend, which includes JSON-based REST api, storage, and
security, is 100% complete, and functioning in production mode now.

The core app, image management and caching code, fast infinite scrolling
support, local sqlite storage, REST client code, and artwork is also all
100% complete.

The UI itself is roughly 75% complete, and what is complete is pretty solid
(looks and performs well). However, we have no resources to commit to
finishing the app and getting it published any time soon, so this is an
opportunity for an experienced developer to join the core team (includes
developer, UI designer, social media/product manager, marketing
communications), in exchange for a percentage of ownership in the company.
Depending on how much effort you are able to commit, the range is 5 - 15%.
Sorry, but we have no more financial resources to pay for further
development.

We originally developed the app UI in Objective-C, but as the concept and
backend evolved, we chose to migrate the app to MonoTouch/C# late last
Fall. We have invested six months of total development time into this
project, but unfortunately, we were not able to finish the app in time for
the holidays and the app has been on hold since.

We are based in Silicon Valley, have a business model in mind for the app,
and do anticipate being able to raise funding at some point after a
successful release of the app. We have Microsoft support, which included an
investment that helped fund our Azure development for the backend.

Our code and all outstanding tickets are hosted on GitHub, and all of our
documentation/specs are available on a separate wiki.

If you're seriously interested in contributing and have solid MonoTouch UI
skills (including the ability to follow the existing code with a minimum of
hand-holding), then please contact me at the following email address:

<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monotouch">contribute at tennyeats.com</A>

If you are interested, you can help save a lot of back and forth if you can
provide any solid evidence of your MonoTouch skills. I don't mean to offend
anyone, but as much as I want to get this finished, I simply don't have
time to mentor an inexperienced developer. It would be ideal if you're
local, but it's not necessary; IM and an occasional face-to-face over Skype
or FaceTime will work.



Thanks,
