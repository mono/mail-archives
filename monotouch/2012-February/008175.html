<PRE>This may be obvious, but in the Assistant Editor window have you tried
clicking on the little tux button that says &quot;Automatic&quot; (it might say
something else if the .h file is missing)? I was able to hunt around that
way and find my .h file when it was missing once. I was employing the
classic noob technique of &quot;randomly clicking stuff&quot;, so I don't remember
what exactly I clicked on to find it, but I did find it, and then was able
to make the tutorial I was working on work.
