<PRE>I'd appreciate peoples' views/experience in the light of what we need to
achieve for one of our customers.

We have an application which we are porting to iOS for one of our customers.
It's the handheld component of a bespoke management system which is licensed
to  /their/ customers and as such won't work with a valid logon to a central
server. This logon etc. is managed by us completely separately from the
handheld application.

I'm trying to work out whether we need to or should be deploying this as an
enterprise application. I have a feeling we shouldn't as we won't
necessarily have control over the devices they're using.

In fact, looking at the terms and conditions of enterprise deployment,
seeing as the application will be used by our customer's customers (i.e. not
internally), we /can't/ use enterprise deployment.

Therefore the option I see is to make the application free and generally
available on the AppStore, but will only work using correct logon
credentials.

The app would therefore appear on the store as something like
&quot;AcmeAssetManager&quot; with a description of &quot;iPhone application for mobile
management of assets using the Acme Asset Manager system&quot;. Obviously, Acme
here in place of our customer, and &quot;Asset Manager&quot; in place of the system
name!

If we do this then we may also have an opportunity for the free app to
operate in demo mode for non-authorised users, and therefore act as a
marketing tool for the service. The service is pretty specialised (can't
give details here), but this could still be useful.

Does this sound like a reasonable approach? Can anyone see pitfalls with
this?

Thanks a lot,

James
