Very nice.  You sound like me, doing cloud/azure development on the backend using rest apis and frontend monotouch/MfA development on the frontend. Wally Date: Mon, 6 Feb 2012 15:04:13 -0800

Subject: [MonoTouch] Looking for a MonoTouch contributor

Hello MonoTouch developers,
We have been developing a social network app for the iPhone, and now we're reaching out to the MonoTouch developer community to find an experienced developer who would like to help us get it finished and submitted to the app store.

To get a sense of what the app is about, here is a placeholder promo page for it:<A HREF="http://www.tennyeats.com/">http://www.tennyeats.com/</A>
In terms of development hours, the app is roughly 3-4 weeks away from being ready to be submitted to Apple for approval.

The cloud-hosted backend, which includes JSON-based REST api, storage, and security, is 100% complete, and functioning in production mode now.
The core app, image management and caching code, fast infinite scrolling support, local sqlite storage, REST client code, and artwork is also all 100% complete.

The UI itself is roughly 75% complete, and what is complete is pretty solid (looks and performs well). However, we have no resources to commit to finishing the app and getting it published any time soon, so this is an opportunity for an experienced developer to join the core team (includes developer, UI designer, social media/product manager, marketing communications), in exchange for a percentage of ownership in the company. Depending on how much effort you are able to commit, the range is 5 - 15%. Sorry, but we have no more financial resources to pay for further development.

We originally developed the app UI in Objective-C, but as the concept and backend evolved, we chose to migrate the app to MonoTouch/C# late last Fall. We have invested six months of total development time into this project, but unfortunately, we were not able to finish the app in time for the holidays and the app has been on hold since.

We are based in Silicon Valley, have a business model in mind for the app, and do anticipate being able to raise funding at some point after a successful release of the app. We have Microsoft support, which included an investment that helped fund our Azure development for the backend.


Our code and all outstanding tickets are hosted on GitHub, and all of our documentation/specs are available on a separate wiki.
If you're seriously interested in contributing and have solid MonoTouch UI skills (including the ability to follow the existing code with a minimum of hand-holding), then please contact me at the following email address:

<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monotouch">contribute at tennyeats.com</A>
If you are interested, you can help save a lot of back and forth if you can provide any solid evidence of your MonoTouch skills. I don't mean to offend anyone, but as much as I want to get this finished, I simply don't have time to mentor an inexperienced developer. It would be ideal if you're local, but it's not necessary; IM and an occasional face-to-face over Skype or FaceTime will work.



Thanks,

Tony Pujals | Lead Developer
