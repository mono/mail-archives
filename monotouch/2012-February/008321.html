<PRE>MT is 4.0. MfA is 3.5. You'd think it doesn't make much of a difference but
if my libs are 3.5 NUnit wont run them from a network location.

Meanwhile, WP7 is Silverlight 4.0. So that totally screws my plan of having
shared code. Project Linker and the associated hacker is not a robust
solution and completely breaks the purpose of sharing the code in the first
place. The alternative is version control and a &quot;stable framework&quot; with
little api churn - which is great (and necessary) for a team, but for my
team of one, completely destroys my competitive advantage.

Basically, I take pride and enjoyment in writing and continuously
refactoring my code, and if I wanted to be constrained by having to
cut-and-paste my refinements across solutions/branches I'd stab myself in
the eye^H^H^H go work for an app factory.

I have a simple request: make MT and MfA able to reference (and use) WP7
targeted libraries in Visual Studio. I tried giving my MfA version the 4.0
library from MT and of course it died on op_Equality.

In fact I wont need WP7 for a month or two, so I'd settle for MfA using 4.0
libs.

Also, it would be awesome if the MfA add-in for VS could *load* MT
projects, and reference a dummy monotouch.dll.
