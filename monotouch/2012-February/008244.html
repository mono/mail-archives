<PRE>I have experienced this many times, and the .h files were missing from the Xcode project itself.  The xib was there but not the .h file.  I believe that closing both MonoDevelop and Xcode and then deleting the obj\Xcode directory from the project was part of my recovering from this - when I have had to do this, I ended up losing the changes I had made in Xcode since things got out of sync.

Chris, do you happen to have your code files on a share on another computer?  (we do, and I felt like that might be part of the problem)

Thank you,

Subject: Re: [MonoTouch] Problem with .h files disappearing in Interface Builder

Hi Chris,

Can you try expanding the project tree in Xcode and verifying that the header files are for sure not there?

I suspect that they are, in fact, there. I suspect that the problem is simply that Xcode is still indexing them and that is why clicking the Assistant Editor is not opening the proper header file.

Thanks,

Jeff

I seem to have stumbled upon the same problem now as siancu here,
<A HREF="http://monotouch.2284126.n4.nabble.com/Question-about-the-Multi-Screened-Application-tutorial-td4404379.html">http://monotouch.2284126.n4.nabble.com/Question-about-the-Multi-Screened-Application-tutorial-td4404379.html</A>
Question about the Multi-Screened Application tutorial , where the .h file
for a ViewController disappears, causing the project to generate a host of
errors when you build it.

I've been able to pretty reliably reproduce the problem with these steps:

1) Create a new solution in MonoDevelop (number of views doesn't matter).

2)  Double-click a ViewController xib to edit it in Interface Builder.

3) In IB, add one or more buttons or other screen elements, open the
Assistant Editor to access the ViewController.h file, ctrl+drag one or more
of them over and create outlets like normal.

4) Quit IB and go back to MonoDevelop. Make significant changes to the code
in the ViewController file in question. In particular, cutting a big chunk
of of the code and pasting in replacement code seems to do the trick.

(I haven't been able to confirm if quitting and relaunching MonoDevelop
between steps 4 and 5 is part of the problem or not.)

5) Double-click on that ViewController's xib again, relaunching IB. Click on
the Assistant Editor button. If the problem occurs, you won't have a .h file
anymore and the Assistant Editor screen will say &quot;No Assistant Results&quot;.

Has anyone else experienced this, and more importantly, is there any way to
to recover or recreate the missing .h file (or get MonoTouch to generate a
new one) without rebuilding the project from scratch?
