<PRE>I currently have a standard Apple developer account.

I'm currently developing an iPad app for a client, that they want to
distribute internally to a select number of devices. To date, I've only
deployed to the App Store to date, and the whole enterprise deployment is
getting more confusing the more I read about it!

As I understand it, if my client wants to deploy to 100 devices or less, I
can use the Ad Hoc approach. I can create a profile for 100 devices that
they simply need to add to their devices, yes? Is the list of devices per
app, or per account? i.e. Can I only have 100 devices for all of my apps, or
each app can have its own list of 100 devices?

With Enterprise deployment, I'd need an Enterprise Developer account with
apple (upgrade from standard possible?). Would this enable me to create an
app for use by a client, or would this only enable me to create apps for
internal distribution within my own company? Are there any additional steps
or requirements for registering?

We have a meeting with a client shortly, and they're going to ask about
their options. I've been reading the Apple documents, but I'm now more
confused than ever!

Many thanks.
