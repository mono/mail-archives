<PRE>I have push notifications working when my app is running (foreground or
background) - the incoming payload (NSDictionary) has an &quot;aps&quot; key.

However, I'm struggling to deal with the notification when my app is run,
for the first time, AFTER the notification is received. The options
dictionary on the FinishedLaunching metod doesn't contain the &quot;aps&quot; key, so
my code is never being called.

I assume it's possible (a requirement?) to deal with notifications upon app
start-up?

This is made all the more difficult by the fact that I can only test this on
the device. I can't launch the app in debug mode by clicking on the
notification. If I exit the app completely, the debugger (naturally) loses
it's connection with the running app.

Thanks
