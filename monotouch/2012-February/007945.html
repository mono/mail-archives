<PRE>Aight, I've been dealing with this for days, and really have gotten to the
point of mentioning it because it's just sooo broken.  This isn't monotouch
per-se, but monodevelop, but I have no idea where that forum might be (so
flamers, please refrain - this is posted in good faith).

Please check out intellisense completion, this has become kind of a joke. 
When it selects DBNull over null (the latter being an intrinsic to the
language, I mean come on now) there's an issue.  Monodevelop's intellisense
is not choosing locals over globals - in most cases cannot even &quot;see&quot;
variables declared in a &quot;foreach&quot; statement, it just becomes a bit silly
when I have to hit escape half the time because it can't actually find
anything or anything reasonable.

I'm guessing whomever is helping out on the intellisense probably has
his/her own style and priorities, hence the DBNull before null, but really -
if you are going to write software that supports the generic sense of
software authoring, then null is, well, &quot;FAR&quot; more relevant to DBNull. 
Perhaps prioritizing locals and local-clause declarations before globals
might be good too.  

Now, in case anyone wants to claim &quot;it's just alphabetized and you're on
crack&quot; - my response is &quot;not even close&quot;.  75% of the time intellisense
doesn't even come up with foreach lcause declared identifiers in the list,
much less prioritizing language intrinsics (the dreaded DBNull).

So, just in the spirit of saying what could be a helpful thing - take a look
at intellisense because, it is really starting to look kinda shoddy.
