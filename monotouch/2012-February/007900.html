<PRE>What we do here:

- We have a professional account. With our 100 device limit we offer some
beta test to a client or internal tests/demos for presentation.
- A client that get the application, get the enterprise account, since it
says that with enterprise you can freely distribute application internally
for your collaborators/personal of your company. In this case, internal
distribution inside your client that has enterprise account
- We configure, if the client permit, all provision and certificate things
with them enterprise account.
- On MonoDevelop, I have my developer account to debug.
- Have each enterprise provision for distribution and enterprise certificate
so when I compile the version of a client, I select it's provision
certificate.
- The application name must be unique, so if the name is
com.yourcompany.yourapplication, on the appstore version with our
certificate, we call our application to each client like
com.yourcompany.yourapplicationclientname1, and
com.yourcompany.yourapplicationclientname2 etc... And must change it when
compiling the release version of the correct client.

You technically can get an enterprise account for your company and
distribute to others, but it could hurt the apple contract since personal of
other companies (clients) aren't from your company&#138;. But it could be really
more easy and practical :/

Subject:  [MonoTouch] Enterprise Deployment Question

I currently have a standard Apple developer account.

I'm currently developing an iPad app for a client, that they want to
distribute internally to a select number of devices. To date, I've only
deployed to the App Store to date, and the whole enterprise deployment is
getting more confusing the more I read about it!

As I understand it, if my client wants to deploy to 100 devices or less, I
can use the Ad Hoc approach. I can create a profile for 100 devices that
they simply need to add to their devices, yes? Is the list of devices per
app, or per account? i.e. Can I only have 100 devices for all of my apps, or
each app can have its own list of 100 devices?

With Enterprise deployment, I'd need an Enterprise Developer account with
apple (upgrade from standard possible?). Would this enable me to create an
app for use by a client, or would this only enable me to create apps for
internal distribution within my own company? Are there any additional steps
or requirements for registering?

We have a meeting with a client shortly, and they're going to ask about
their options. I've been reading the Apple documents, but I'm now more
confused than ever!

Many thanks.
