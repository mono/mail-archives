<PRE>Dear Brian:

I am Joe Wolfe and you wrote the code for The Global  Business Game. I hope 
you have been doing well.
 
As you may know, the game you wrote for me has been published in an online  
version by Innovative Learning Solutions. As you did this work back in the 
late  1990s a question has arisen regarding the need to update the code. 
They have  done an in house appraisal and I quote here their analysis and their 
ability to  continue to use your code...
 
The GBG shell is programmed in Visual Basic 6 (1998). Executable  produced 
by VB6 maybe problematic to run on newer operating systems (this  happened 
to our processing and delphi 3). First we will try to keep older  versions of 
operating system to run it there. Already the situation of keeping  
separate machine for GBG makes it bit more expensive for ILS . It may become  
complicated for us to keep older version of operating system in the further  
future, especially in case there are no patches to security problems from  
Microsoft. If this happens, we will need to transfer codes from VB6 to something  
newer. This transition may require larger investment to buy new development 
 tools, third party components used by GBG shell and pay for the work.  
(Transition to new marketplace processing may have taken about 1 year of  
cumulative effort 
 
Can you shed any light on the degree this appraisal is  correct?

Best regards,
 
Joe
