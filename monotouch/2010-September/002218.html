&gt;<i> It has crashed on me a couple of times, but nothign major, and I've
</I>&gt;<i> not lost code. It's WAY better than coding a MT app in VS and moving
</I>&gt;<i> the code back.
</I>

I couldn't imagine to use MD for development - or to be more precise - to write code.

Poor intellisense, no &quot;Context Help&quot;, killing files (when CR - CR/LF is mixed), invisible cursors,

marking multiple images - set a property - everything &quot;unmarked&quot;...

Context menus where you first have to leave the menu (move mousepointer outside), and so forth.

I use VS 2008 (or 2010) to code and MD to build / deploy.

 

I pay the 4xx Bucks to be able to use C# instead of O-C. The price is a bit high but so far OK.

The only thing I'm curious is how &quot;bundles&quot; (MT / MDroid / ML) will be priced.


2 or 3 times 4xx bucks would be to much. But let's see what happens.

 

About MT itself - I had some problems, found some bugs...

BUT - everything got fixed very fast - and for stoppers I got workarounds.

So I'm really happy with this.

 

Someone wrote that MT adds another layer of &quot;potential bugs&quot; above O-C.

That's right (and a must by design) - but I'm still very sure that GC and the fact that I use &quot;my common language&quot;

results in better software - at least when a &quot;.NET guy&quot; like me is coding.

And GC is really a great thing - simpy look how many O-C related threads about &quot;memory leaks&quot; exist.

 

Conclusion: 

MD is far away from what a good IDE should be.

MT is a thing I rally love.

Pricing is (ATM) OK - but I'm really curious about the prices of future &quot;enhancments&quot; (product bundles).
