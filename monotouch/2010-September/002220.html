<PRE>For me, it's sort of like the appstore:

I spent around &#163;2000 on a macbook pro.
I pay around &#163;250/year for an internet connection
I pay about &#163;300/year for a phone (non)contract
I paid &#163;499 for my iphone4 (no contract)

Paying &#163;300 for a MT license, even if I only ever do free apps, makes
sense. At the moment, I've _nearly_ made back my MT license from one
app, and I have another one (which should make more, in theory) coming
out shortly. I enjoy using MT, but I _hated_ obj-c and xcode. I could
have done both in xc/obj-c, but it would have taken a lot longer and
I'd be seriously frustrated (esp the new one which does a LOT of XML
manipulation)

Oh, and I can expense it, so I dont pay tax on that money.... even tho
my main business isn't iphone apps.



In the appstore:

user paid $100/month to AT&amp;T ($1200)
user paid $150 for the phone

user objects to paying 99c for a fairly complex and useful app, says
&quot;this should be free - some of the other ones in this category are&quot;.
me: if you are that price sensitive, I suggest you sell your phone,
you idiot. Or use one of the free ones...

The race to the bottom on price has been won. Or rather, lost by
everyone. No wonder few people are making much out of the appstore.

I think Novell have the price about right, personally.

BTW, do yo know how much a normal developer's setup with MS stuff is?
VS: around $700-10K (depending on the version). Sure there is a free
version of VS, but it's seriously crippled, eg no Resharper, 'cos no
plugins. Useless to me.
Windows: $350 (us)
MSDN sub: $3K to $10K per dev. Most companies STEAL this, BTW (buy one
(or get 5 via partner status), and use it for a team of 10, 20, 50,
more....)
etc.... Software development has never been a cheap hobby.
