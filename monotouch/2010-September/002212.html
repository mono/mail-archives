<PRE>In one of the old MIX conferences, Microsoft demo'ed remote debugging of a Silverlight app running on a Mac using Visual Studio. 

I wish MonoTouch would have followed that route, where I use my windows notebook and Visual Studio to build apps and publish it to the Mac where it runs on the Simulator using the iPhone SDK. Maybe Miguel and the rest of the team can explain how difficult this would be.

In absence of my fantasy .NET environment for iOS, Mono Develop has not been that bad as some folks make it out to be. Sure it crashes but I have the same issues with VS when the XAML designer is used. 

The bigger problem with MT is that the community is very small and when you want to use third party iOS libraries or even code that is an issue. There is a lot of sample Objective C sample code out there. 
eg. <A HREF="http://forums.monotouch.net/yaf_postst1009.aspx">http://forums.monotouch.net/yaf_postst1009.aspx</A>

It would be nice if you could add Objective C files, projects or libraries without the bTouch path. The problem with bTouch is that you need to understand Objective C which defeats the purpose. 

I am hoping that with Apple lifting 3.1.3, the community will grow and mitigate these issues. 

In the end the reason to choose MT for me are
1. Don't have the inclination to learn Objective C
2. Focus on one platform - CLR
3. .NET garbage collection 
4. A subset of the .NET stack 
5. And I really can't program without Linq :-)

Thx,
Ash
