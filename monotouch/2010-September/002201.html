<PRE>While I'm not a huge fan of MD as compared to VS, compared to Xcode, it wins hands-down.

Xcode can barely be called an IDE. Heaping, stinky, POS that it is.

Thanks everyone so far for your input.

A better comparison for my argument would be MD vs xcode, not VS.

It is interesting so far that the majority of the con arguments are centered around the IDE.  Which is valid.  But really not a huge con because MD gets the job done very nicely.

Maybe I should have asked the Cocoa heads for some cons.

It is useful, imo, to examine both sides of the tools debate and try to convince yourself why MT is not the right solution.  I then have a better chance of countering that argument when it comes.

Tomorrow is the presentation.  I'm not sure what the outcome will be but I'm cautiously optimistic.

I have been using MonoDevelop a lot for the past year (and daily for the past few months) and love it. The developers do a lot of work to make c#/VS users feel 'at home' - the solution explorer (and shared file-format), intellisense, tooltips w/ XML comment parsing, the dockable panes, refactoring support, etc. We even have it accessing TFS via svnbridge for integrated source control.

The features/price ratio is &quot;infinitely&quot; better than VisualStudio (or NaN if you prefer :). For MonoDevelop to be as advanced as it is - and FREE - is an amazing feat. When you consider the combined price-tag of MonoTouch(399) and MonoDevelop(free), it's still a heck of a lot cheaper than any VS SKU &lt;<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-C5E-00521-Visual-Studio-Professional/dp/B0038KTO8S/">http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-C5E-00521-Visual-Studio-Professional/dp/B0038KTO8S/</A>&gt;  (except Express of course).

Although I do &quot;occasionally&quot; (like once a month) have a problem with debugging, generally it works as-advertised. Also - the soft debugger is *awesome* for MonoTouch... debugging over wifi is a pretty-darn-cool achievement IMO. As is MonoTouch generally.

My experience is so different to some of these negative comments that I wonder if we're talking about the same app! In the spirit of the thread, while MD isn't VS, I also don't think it is a &quot;con&quot; in the ObjC vc MT debate.

I have to chime in here. Full disclosure: as of now, I'm not a
MonoTouch user (hopefully will change very *very* soon).

To counter act all the hate on MonoDevelop - I find it pretty damn
stable.  I've done nearly the entire development on a very substantial
project within MD.  The project consists of an ASP.Net MVC front end
calling into a thin client business layer that interacts with a system
service (a Windows service surfaced in Linux using the mono-service
wrapper).  It all works very, very well - considering - and was about
95% developed purely on Mac using Mono / MD.

The biggest MD issue that's yet to be resolved, IMO, is the debugging
experience.  This is probably the most unstable bit of MD.  Now
debugging isn't broken, per se, but it's fairly slow, completely stops
intermittently (no crash, it just quits out of debugging), and doesn't
handle multiple threads the best.  But it *does* work.  One bit of
advice for debugging is if the IDE seems to halt, do not kill the MD
process, but kill the run-away debug process (it'll be titled &quot;mono&quot;
and pegging your CPU).  This will allow you to simply restart
debugging w/o having to restart the IDE every time.

I'm about 350 hours into this project so I'm pretty satisfied with my
MD experience.  If you're curious about the project there's a teaser
page here:  <A HREF="http://tendr.me">http://tendr.me</A>  We're aiming to be in Beta w/i 3 months.
The plan is to eventually develop a native iPhone app on top of the
MonoTouch framework.

But more investment in MonoDevelop is my top want-to-have from the entire (otherwise fantastic) Mono project, and absolutely a prerequisite to my purchase and use of MT. Given the recent Apple 3.3.1 news and Miguel's blog post regarding it, this is an area I'm keeping my eye on.
