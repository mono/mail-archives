<PRE>I think you have to look at it from an opportunity cost perspective not a
TCO.

I.e. an existing App store developer would already have spent all those
costs to be able to develop an app with objective-c, the choice that
prospective MonoTouch developers have to make is to evaluate whether or not
the additional cost are worth the benefits.

Personally if you're app is doing a lot of UI functionality I actually
prefer the well proven and documented path of xcode/interface builder. Using
MonoTouch/MonoDevelop is not a total productivity win as some time is lost
translating Obj-C apis to MT apis, searching documentation to find out how
some things are achieved in MT, working around any bugs, etc. Also I don't
know how far you can go without learning any Obj-c as I think at least being
able to read it is important if you're considering any iPhone dev.

However if you are a C# developer and have the ability to re-use your
existing libraries or have to do something that is notoriously difficult to
do in Obj-C (i.e. calling web services, data traversing or manipulation,
etc) then the ROI of your MonoTouch licence will be recuperated pretty
quickly provided your app is sufficiently popular.

Your mileage may very but in general the C# language and Base class library
are much more enjoyable to work with then the equivalent Obj-c/Cocoa
apis. The great thing is that you can download and develop with MonoTouch
for free so you can gauge the value of the product for yourself. Also now
that Apple has lifted all 3rd party dev tools restrictions I'm much more
confident in the continued use and improvement of the technology.

&gt;<i> For me, it's sort of like the appstore:

</I>&gt;<i> I pay about &#163;300/year for a phone (non)contract

</I>&gt;<i> Paying &#163;300 for a MT license, even if I only ever do free apps, makes

</I>&gt;<i> out shortly. I enjoy using MT, but I _hated_ obj-c and xcode. I could

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, and I can expense it, so I dont pay tax on that money.... even tho

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the appstore:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> user paid $100/month to AT&amp;T ($1200)
</I>&gt;<i> user paid $150 for the phone
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> user objects to paying 99c for a fairly complex and useful app, says
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;this should be free - some of the other ones in this category are&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> me: if you are that price sensitive, I suggest you sell your phone,
</I>&gt;<i> you idiot. Or use one of the free ones...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The race to the bottom on price has been won. Or rather, lost by
</I>&gt;<i> everyone. No wonder few people are making much out of the appstore.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think Novell have the price about right, personally.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, do yo know how much a normal developer's setup with MS stuff is?
</I>&gt;<i> VS: around $700-10K (depending on the version). Sure there is a free
</I>&gt;<i> version of VS, but it's seriously crippled, eg no Resharper, 'cos no
</I>&gt;<i> plugins. Useless to me.
</I>&gt;<i> Windows: $350 (us)
</I>&gt;<i> MSDN sub: $3K to $10K per dev. Most companies STEAL this, BTW (buy one
</I>&gt;<i> (or get 5 via partner status), and use it for a team of 10, 20, 50,
</I>&gt;<i> more....)
</I>&gt;<i> etc.... Software development has never been a cheap hobby.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's a nice thread, and it does make some good points, but as much a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; NSResponder is perverting the thread in places, it does seem an awful
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lot like Rory Blyth vs &quot;Objective-C&quot;. Past his first long comment, he is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tailing off in to extreme fanboyisms.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think my stance has always been - MonoTouch is too expensive for me.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm developing free apps, but have lately had absolutely no time to even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; look at source code. So, $99 a year is all I can afford to invest. I'd
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; extremely glad I didn't pay for MT. I still hold out a hope that one day
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a version will be released with a realistic hobbyist price tag.
