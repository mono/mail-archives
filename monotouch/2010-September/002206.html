<PRE>Yeah a fairer comparison at the moment with IDEs is to consider Xcode 4 which has some features I wish VS had.

</I>&gt;<i> MonoTouch is awesome. I absolutely love MonoTouch.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In my opinion it's not fair to consider MD to be &quot;free&quot; in the context of MonoTouch. In that context, as far as I am concerned MD costs $399. Xcode in this context is completely free.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't used Xcode since, well, MonoTouch came out. I have released two apps in the app store writtenin ObjC using Xcode, and although it's often a pretty simple IDE, I generally found it stable, usable and non-frustrating.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now I am currently using the latest Mono (version 2.6.7), latest MonoTouch (3.1.1.7912) and the latest MonoDevelop (2.4). I get a null reference exception about every 5 minutes. This happens often while debugging, and also on almost every single Go To Declaration call. Also in the past 2 days I have gotten MD stuck in an infinite loop (beach ball that never goes away). I first tried to kill it with the Finder, and although the Finder considered the app dead the window persisted. The second time I killed it with the kill command.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are also lots of little nitpicks about MD that really add up, like how you can't expand a unit test result (Run Unit Tests, in Test Result window attempt to expand a result) without first defocusing MD and then refocusing it. The same is often true with expanding tree nodes in the solution explorer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not trying to be a jerk. I full well understand MD is a *giant* undertaking. And all in all I actually think MD will become my favorite IDE once the kinks are worked out. I also full well know what it's like to be on a high pressure team that is expected to put out a lot of high quality code. So don't get me wrong, I understand and don't think any less of the Mono team because of MD's current state.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But it still should be known: if you are going to buy MonoTouch, you should be aware MD is not quite ready for prime time, so buyer beware.

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks everyone so far for your input.

</I>&gt;<i> A better comparison for my argument would be MD vs xcode, not VS.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is interesting so far that the majority of the con arguments are centered around the IDE.  Which is valid.  But really not a huge con because MD gets the job done very nicely.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe I should have asked the Cocoa heads for some cons.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is useful, imo, to examine both sides of the tools debate and try to convince yourself why MT is not the right solution.  I then have a better chance of countering that argument when it comes.

</I>&gt;<i> I have been using MonoDevelop a lot for the past year (and daily for the past few months) and love it. The developers do a lot of work to make c#/VS users feel 'at home' - the solution explorer (and shared file-format), intellisense, tooltips w/ XML comment parsing, the dockable panes, refactoring support, etc. We even have it accessing TFS via svnbridge for integrated source control.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The features/price ratio is &quot;infinitely&quot; better than VisualStudio (or NaN if you prefer :). For MonoDevelop to be as advanced as it is - and FREE - is an amazing feat. When you consider the combined price-tag of MonoTouch(399) and MonoDevelop(free), it's still a heck of a lot cheaper than any VS SKU &lt;<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-C5E-00521-Visual-Studio-Professional/dp/B0038KTO8S/">http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-C5E-00521-Visual-Studio-Professional/dp/B0038KTO8S/</A>&gt;  (except Express of course). 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Although I do &quot;occasionally&quot; (like once a month) have a problem with debugging, generally it works as-advertised. Also - the soft debugger is *awesome* for MonoTouch... debugging over wifi is a pretty-darn-cool achievement IMO. As is MonoTouch generally.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My experience is so different to some of these negative comments that I wonder if we're talking about the same app! In the spirit of the thread, while MD isn't VS, I also don't think it is a &quot;con&quot; in the ObjC vc MT debate.

</I>&gt;<i> I have to chime in here. Full disclosure: as of now, I'm not a

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To counter act all the hate on MonoDevelop - I find it pretty damn
</I>&gt;<i> stable.  I've done nearly the entire development on a very substantial
</I>&gt;<i> project within MD.  The project consists of an ASP.Net MVC front end
</I>&gt;<i> calling into a thin client business layer that interacts with a system
</I>&gt;<i> service (a Windows service surfaced in Linux using the mono-service
</I>&gt;<i> wrapper).  It all works very, very well - considering - and was about
</I>&gt;<i> 95% developed purely on Mac using Mono / MD.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The biggest MD issue that's yet to be resolved, IMO, is the debugging
</I>&gt;<i> experience.  This is probably the most unstable bit of MD.  Now
</I>&gt;<i> debugging isn't broken, per se, but it's fairly slow, completely stops
</I>&gt;<i> intermittently (no crash, it just quits out of debugging), and doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> handle multiple threads the best.  But it *does* work.  One bit of
</I>&gt;<i> advice for debugging is if the IDE seems to halt, do not kill the MD
</I>&gt;<i> process, but kill the run-away debug process (it'll be titled &quot;mono&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and pegging your CPU).  This will allow you to simply restart
</I>&gt;<i> debugging w/o having to restart the IDE every time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm about 350 hours into this project so I'm pretty satisfied with my
</I>&gt;<i> MD experience.  If you're curious about the project there's a teaser
</I>&gt;<i> page here:  <A HREF="http://tendr.me">http://tendr.me</A>  We're aiming to be in Beta w/i 3 months.
</I>&gt;<i> The plan is to eventually develop a native iPhone app on top of the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; That said, VS sets the bar really, really high. But more investment in MonoDevelop is my top want-to-have from the entire (otherwise fantastic) Mono project, and absolutely a prerequisite to my purchase and use of MT. Given the recent Apple 3.3.1 news and Miguel's blog post regarding it, this is an area I'm keeping my eye on.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Really? I have the opposite experience. VS2010 over VS2008's matra seems
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to be &quot;its faster&quot; as in &quot;it crashes faster&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm a code rush junkie so I tolerate VS, but when I first used MD a lot,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; day to day after using a lot of VS I was impressed. IMO OOTB MD is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; faster and has more useful refactoring tools than VS OOTB. Of course VS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; does so much more than edit C# code, so the two tools aren't really
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; comparable overall, but for just editing C#, I think MD is very close (a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; few refactorings away from) to replacing VS as my day to day shell.
