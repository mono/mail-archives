<PRE>I have to chime in here. Full disclosure: as of now, I'm not a
MonoTouch user (hopefully will change very *very* soon).

To counter act all the hate on MonoDevelop - I find it pretty damn
stable.  I've done nearly the entire development on a very substantial
project within MD.  The project consists of an ASP.Net MVC front end
calling into a thin client business layer that interacts with a system
service (a Windows service surfaced in Linux using the mono-service
wrapper).  It all works very, very well - considering - and was about
95% developed purely on Mac using Mono / MD.

The biggest MD issue that's yet to be resolved, IMO, is the debugging
experience.  This is probably the most unstable bit of MD.  Now
debugging isn't broken, per se, but it's fairly slow, completely stops
intermittently (no crash, it just quits out of debugging), and doesn't
handle multiple threads the best.  But it *does* work.  One bit of
advice for debugging is if the IDE seems to halt, do not kill the MD
process, but kill the run-away debug process (it'll be titled &quot;mono&quot;
and pegging your CPU).  This will allow you to simply restart
debugging w/o having to restart the IDE every time.

I'm about 350 hours into this project so I'm pretty satisfied with my
MD experience.  If you're curious about the project there's a teaser
page here:  <A HREF="http://tendr.me">http://tendr.me</A>  We're aiming to be in Beta w/i 3 months.
The plan is to eventually develop a native iPhone app on top of the
MonoTouch framework.

Given the recent Apple 3.3.1 news and Miguel's blog post regarding it, this is an area I'm keeping my eye on.
