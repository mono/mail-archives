<PRE>FYI, I've been able to actually kill MD in that scenario by killing the mono debugger, I think it's the MDG process or whatever.

Sometimes, if you don't kill that process, you can't even get MD to really go away.

MonoTouch is awesome. I absolutely love MonoTouch.

In my opinion it's not fair to consider MD to be &quot;free&quot; in the context of MonoTouch. In that context, as far as I am concerned MD costs $399. Xcode in this context is completely free.

I haven't used Xcode since, well, MonoTouch came out. I have released two apps in the app store writtenin ObjC using Xcode, and although it's often a pretty simple IDE, I generally found it stable, usable and non-frustrating.

Now I am currently using the latest Mono (version 2.6.7), latest MonoTouch (3.1.1.7912) and the latest MonoDevelop (2.4). I get a null reference exception about every 5 minutes. This happens often while debugging, and also on almost every single Go To Declaration call. Also in the past 2 days I have gotten MD stuck in an infinite loop (beach ball that never goes away). I first tried to kill it with the Finder, and although the Finder considered the app dead the window persisted. The second time I killed it with the kill command.

There are also lots of little nitpicks about MD that really add up, like how you can't expand a unit test result (Run Unit Tests, in Test Result window attempt to expand a result) without first defocusing MD and then refocusing it. The same is often true with expanding tree nodes in the solution explorer.

I'm not trying to be a jerk. I full well understand MD is a *giant* undertaking. And all in all I actually think MD will become my favorite IDE once the kinks are worked out. I also full well know what it's like to be on a high pressure team that is expected to put out a lot of high quality code. So don't get me wrong, I understand and don't think any less of the Mono team because of MD's current state.

But it still should be known: if you are going to buy MonoTouch, you should be aware MD is not quite ready for prime time, so buyer beware.

Thanks everyone so far for your input.

A better comparison for my argument would be MD vs xcode, not VS.

It is interesting so far that the majority of the con arguments are centered around the IDE.  Which is valid.  But really not a huge con because MD gets the job done very nicely.

Maybe I should have asked the Cocoa heads for some cons.

It is useful, imo, to examine both sides of the tools debate and try to convince yourself why MT is not the right solution.  I then have a better chance of countering that argument when it comes.

Tomorrow is the presentation.  I'm not sure what the outcome will be but I'm cautiously optimistic.

I have been using MonoDevelop a lot for the past year (and daily for the past few months) and love it. The developers do a lot of work to make c#/VS users feel 'at home' - the solution explorer (and shared file-format), intellisense, tooltips w/ XML comment parsing, the dockable panes, refactoring support, etc. We even have it accessing TFS via svnbridge for integrated source control.

The features/price ratio is &quot;infinitely&quot; better than VisualStudio (or NaN if you prefer :). For MonoDevelop to be as advanced as it is - and FREE - is an amazing feat. When you consider the combined price-tag of MonoTouch(399) and MonoDevelop(free), it's still a heck of a lot cheaper than any VS SKU &lt;<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-C5E-00521-Visual-Studio-Professional/dp/B0038KTO8S/">http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-C5E-00521-Visual-Studio-Professional/dp/B0038KTO8S/</A>&gt;  (except Express of course).

Although I do &quot;occasionally&quot; (like once a month) have a problem with debugging, generally it works as-advertised. Also - the soft debugger is *awesome* for MonoTouch... debugging over wifi is a pretty-darn-cool achievement IMO. As is MonoTouch generally.

My experience is so different to some of these negative comments that I wonder if we're talking about the same app! In the spirit of the thread, while MD isn't VS, I also don't think it is a &quot;con&quot; in the ObjC vc MT debate.

I have to chime in here. Full disclosure: as of now, I'm not a
MonoTouch user (hopefully will change very *very* soon).

To counter act all the hate on MonoDevelop - I find it pretty damn
stable.  I've done nearly the entire development on a very substantial
project within MD.  The project consists of an ASP.Net MVC front end
calling into a thin client business layer that interacts with a system
service (a Windows service surfaced in Linux using the mono-service
wrapper).  It all works very, very well - considering - and was about
95% developed purely on Mac using Mono / MD.

The biggest MD issue that's yet to be resolved, IMO, is the debugging
experience.  This is probably the most unstable bit of MD.  Now
debugging isn't broken, per se, but it's fairly slow, completely stops
intermittently (no crash, it just quits out of debugging), and doesn't
handle multiple threads the best.  But it *does* work.  One bit of
advice for debugging is if the IDE seems to halt, do not kill the MD
process, but kill the run-away debug process (it'll be titled &quot;mono&quot;
and pegging your CPU).  This will allow you to simply restart
debugging w/o having to restart the IDE every time.

I'm about 350 hours into this project so I'm pretty satisfied with my
MD experience.  If you're curious about the project there's a teaser
page here:  <A HREF="http://tendr.me">http://tendr.me</A>  We're aiming to be in Beta w/i 3 months.
The plan is to eventually develop a native iPhone app on top of the
MonoTouch framework.
