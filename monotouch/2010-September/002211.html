<PRE>Hi,

As this seems to be diverting in MonoDevelop VS VisualStudio VS X-Code and MonoTouch vs CocoaTouch:

I've been official betatester for Microsoft Visual Studio from VS.NET 2003. That crashed. Crashed. Crashed. Crashed. Hell, crashed....
I use X-Code from NeXTStep's 3.3 Project Builder.
I used Anjuta, KDevelop, vim, Notepad++.
And I use MonoDevelop.

VS users expect the &quot;rapid application development&quot; that's not part of X-Code (well, X-Code 4 tries, but having to set the outlets manually is yet a rapid-to-slow), and the integration on the same window/application of all the features (GUI design, code editing, auditing, debugging, so on).
But Visual Studio is &quot;less feature more money&quot; scheme. VS2005 removed Managed Extensions for C++, VS2008 removed J#, VS2010 removed support for every Windows Mobile &lt; 7 even LONG before Windows Mobile 7 was ready to develop...

That's not an IDE, it's an expensive speed limiter.

Anjuta and KDevelop are, in MY opinion, ugly, unintegrated even with themselves, difficult to use, to everything.

vim and Notepad++ are not even IDEs but just code-coloring note pads.

X-Code is an oda to simplicity of development, but it lacks plugins. And that is OUR fault, as developers, not Apple's one, not to create, maintain and publish FREE plugins.

And MonoDevelop however takes the best of every world.
It includes the RAD of VS, it's simple to use (almost as X-Code), and it's full of plugins.

And it's free. And it evolves at the speed of light.
It has not been so much when MonoDevelop was &quot;not supported at all&quot; on Mac, and now it works &quot;almost&quot; flawlessly.

It crashes? Of course, every application contain bugs.

But if Visual Studio crashes, and crashes, and crashes. How many time will you spend waiting for the correction? 2 years? 3?
And you'll have to pay the new version, in the hope, it stop crashing someday (if it ever does).

You ask MonoDevelop to improve, and their developers work, hard, work, hard, IMPROVE!
And in less than a month there is a new version, improved, that crashes less.

It's a magnific IDE, no doubt.

And about MonoTouch.

Well the price is high (in my opinion) for being just a binding. Or at least, it would be better if there was a reduced price for individual developers, that ones that less than more are able to get enough from their work to live monthly.

But it gives a LOT of advantages.

Not only it allow us to use C#, but it also opens us the multiplatform spectrum.
In my last project only 10% of the code was GUI, so I reused 90% of it thanks not to using C#, but to using Mono and MonoTouch.
I just created an OS agnostic core, and then a GUI in Windows.Forms, another in Compact Framework, another in GTK# and another one with MonoTouch.
And most of the GUI code that reacts to a GUI event and calls/process the core response, just copy/paste.

So, the 330 &#8364; I'll spend on MonoTouch are not saving me from learning ObjectiveC (that I know).

They are saving me for having to do the core in C, a GUI in C++ (MFC), another one in C++ (for Windows Mobile), another GUI in C (GTK+) and another in ObjectiveC (CocoaTouch).
And I'm praying for MonoMac reaching stable ASAP and for someone letting me access to the closed beta of MonoDroid.

And finally, to the guy that said most iOS examples on Google are in ObjectiveC:
I've learnt more ObjectiveC using MonoTouch that I've never learnt using it, because I see, how ObjC is doing things I know how C# does, and then, I learn how to do them in ObjC.
And I think this learning method is better than ObjC books, tutorials or screencasts: comparison with what you already know how to do.

And the MonoTouch team is doing that better, converting Apple examples from ObjC to C#+MonoTouch.
