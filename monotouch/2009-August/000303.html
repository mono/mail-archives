&gt;<i>  What do you think is the most common scenario for monotouch apps

</I>Any distributed and/or peer-to-peer application in which exists well
understood, predefined messages being passed around as binary objects
will greatly benefit by using a binary format
such as ProtoBuf.  Gaming is the first thing that comes to mind, though the
one area that I have been preparing to begin diving deep into the
implementation is using it as an efficient means for passing LLUP/Blip
Messages[1] around in a much more efficient manner than is otherwise
possible using XML, JSON, or other commonly used serialization formats for
that matter.  If you look at the class files in [2] you'll notice that while
the file formats they represent (Atom as well as my own messaging extensions
in LLUP) have been specified as being XML-based, there's absolutely no
reason why they can't be represented in both serialization formats (even
allowing for JSON serialization if/when mixed content doesn't come into the
picture), providing a lossless way of ensuring that when XML is the best
serialization/deserialization choice, simple enough, and when PB's are the
best choice, simple enough, etc.)

&gt;<i> I really dig your passion to improve the platform, I&#8217;m just wondering if
</I>&gt;<i> you are thinking more of internal app use, or of implementing binary
</I>&gt;<i> services on the Internet for an app to call efficiently?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I think there's room for both. But as per above, I believe that the mobile
space, with its inherent limitations in over the wire, memory, and processor
bandwidth constraints, presents the perfect opportunity for us to take a
step back and begin to think about how to reduce resource consumption in
such a way that leaves us with a surplus of available resources rather than
a our current tendency to be left with a deficit.

Okay, okay, I'm living in a dream land of fluffy white &quot;what could possibly
go wrong&quot; clouds. ;-)

But having been a member of the original Windows CE 1.0 &amp; 2.0 team back in
the day, I find myself wishing I had placed greater emphasis on promoting
more efficient protocols and teaching best practices that embraced the
expectation that resources would always be limited, to then be pleasantly
surprised when I was wrong.

&gt;<i> I got the impression ProtocolBuffers were most often used as a datacenter
</I>&gt;<i> or intranet technology, for example to let Google have nodes talking to each
</I>&gt;<i> other really fast.  I wasn&#8217;t aware many people had started using them on the
</I>&gt;<i> public internet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yup, you're absolutely spot on.  But from my experience the only reason for
not using them outside of the data center is the assumed belief that if they
were really /that good/, people would be using them with increased
abundance, doing so with a skip in their step and glee in their voice as
they blogged about all the wonderfulness
PB's bring to the World, and everyone who isn't using them are now
several steps behind everyone else who is.


&gt;<i> Also I assume this requires opening another server port for handling PB
</I>&gt;<i> requests?  It took web servers quite a while to refine pretty solid
</I>&gt;<i> security, I assume a PB server would a similar evolution?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>And this is exactly the reason why I believe that, as of yet, anyway,
you haven't seen the glee
and the skip mentioned above as people simply haven't figured out how to
best use them yet in a way that doesn't reinvent the wheel. Of course, you
and I both know that there's no need to reinvent the wheel, a fact that I've
been fighting for since the very early days of this exact discussion on the
ProtoBuf Discussion list [3], and while [4] provides a snapshot of all the
various distribution methods we're using as far as LLUP/BLip Messaging is
concerned, only two of those are not specific to using HTTP as the transport
layer, the Nuxleus.Messaging.Server classes (which use raw TCP sockets to
efficiently replicated messages from one node to another, and
Nuxleus.Messaging.XMPP which -- to be honest -- both has and can just as
easily use HTTP as it's transport layer.

Of course I doubt much I'll find any argument with the idea that when all is
said and done, the bottom line is that HTTP(S) works /FABULOUSLY/ for 99% of
the use cases, and for the remaining 1% you can either bite the bullet and
force HTTP(S) to work, or drop down to raw TCP sockets, all of which are
supported via the current state of the MonoTouch SDK,

&gt;<i> Just curious &#8211; I haven&#8217;t actually used them yet myself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I think we're most definitely on the same page with all of this. :-)
