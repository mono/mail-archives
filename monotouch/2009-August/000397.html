<PRE>As a long time .NET developer who has been doing iPhone development lately,
I can tell you I'm very excited about MonoTouch.  Excited and very impressed
with the design of the integration.

That being said, I'm having problems getting started with IB and
MonoDevelop.  I've gone through the &quot;Hello Mono&quot; example and that seems to
work fine.  I've been attempting to create a simple view.XIB/ViewController
and load it into the window view, as you would in a &quot;normal&quot; iPhone
application.  I can get the view to load, however it doesn't seem to link up
my properties to the outlets or be calling my events such as ViewDidLoad or
ViewWillAppear.   In my example, I've set my c# class to be the File's
Owner... is this the correct use?

I've done this quite a bit in Objective-C, but I'm struggling with the
correct approach in MonoTouch.  Is there a simple example out there that
shows this approach?
