<PRE>I think the Checkbox idea might be quite good. I too have been struggling with this because it's a bit odd having the interface in IB saying Controller but it also makes sense for the code-behind to be controller.

Problem is, if they don't match, will MD still understand to group them together in the treeview?

The templates for various views is a good idea. Allows people to setup new projects with navigation controllers and the &quot;root view controller&quot; also additionally being constructed.

I am also hitting another issue related to navigation controllers when hooking it up myself. In XCode there is a concept of groups (they are like folders) but they don't actually save files in folders. It just allows you to organize your code.

For example, I decided to create a navigation controller based app, I then created in MD folder called &quot;Views&quot;, and decided to organize my controllers in there. I pointed the navigation view controllers root view to another view which I created into the &quot;Views&quot; folder. When running the app it cannot find this view, it says it is unable to load the NIB file.

Unhandled Exception: MonoTouch.Foundation.MonoTouchException: Objective-C exception thrown.  Name: NSInvalidArgumentException Reason: -[UIViewController _loadViewFromNibNamed:bundle:] was unable to load a nib named &quot;MainViewController&quot;

After googling I found:<A HREF="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/906360/referencing-a-nib-file-in-a-subfolder-of-an-xcode-compiled-cocoa-app-bundle">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/906360/referencing-a-nib-file-in-a-subfolder-of-an-xcode-compiled-cocoa-app-bundle</A>

So I'm wondering. Is there anything we can do/add to MD that can allow us to organize our views? I'm not sure if this is something the codegen of the designer.cs file just needs to handle or not.

Only other item I can remember at the moment is the resources issue we discussed on IRC about not being able to use images in IB. I believe you discovered a xcode project needs to be generated for IB to pick up resources in our projects we build in MD.

Thanks for being so accessible and open to feedback with us. I am really enjoying being a part of this preview.

Thanks!
Simon

I think it would make sense to append &quot;Controller&quot; (although could that be a
checkbox-enabled feature? - since I want it but other people don't)
I also like the idea of similar templates with different content.

Subject: [MonoTouch] Request for feedback: MonoDevelop templates

Now that people have played around with MonoTouch a bit, I'd like to
solicit some feedback on the templates in MonoDevelop. Are there any
changes that we could make to the existing templates, or templates
that we could add, that would make it easier or clearer to work with
MonoTouch?

In particular I'd like feedback on the experimental &quot;View Interface
Definition with Controller&quot; template. This template contains a
controller with a name matching the template name, and also adds a
&quot;.xib.cs&quot; file for the user code, with the partial class for this
controller. I've already added a view to the template too which is
hooked up to an outlet on the controller, and this will be in the next
MD drop.

* Is this template useful?
* Would it be useful to have other similar templates with different
content, e.g. navigation controller, search display controller?
* What combinations of objects in xib files and C# classes would be
useful in such templates?
* Should the controller name in these templates simply be based on the
xib name or append &quot;Controller&quot; to it?

Thank you for your feedback!
