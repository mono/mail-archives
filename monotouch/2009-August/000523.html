<PRE>Here is my simplest version of using a UITableView in an iPhone app:

There's nothing new here that isn't in monocatalog sample. I just found it
useful to reduce the sample down to the least code that I could, then add
features from there.

&gt;<i> The experience of one newbie:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm a long-time developer (C#/Windows most recently, lots of real-time
</I>&gt;<i> bare metal and Unix prior to that) who recently decided to build some
</I>&gt;<i> iPhone apps for my own education, entertainment and because nobody was
</I>&gt;<i> building apps I wanted or the way I wanted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I bought a Mac, downloaded the SDK, bought a couple books, read
</I>&gt;<i> others through Books 24x7, did lots of Google searches, and started
</I>&gt;<i> coding an app with Objective-C and the iPhone SDK. I found that I hate
</I>&gt;<i> Objective-C (apparently, I'm the only programmer in the world who
</I>&gt;<i> couldn't learn Objective-C in a few hours), love the capabilities of
</I>&gt;<i> the iPhone SDK framework, and am totally mystified by the whole UI
</I>&gt;<i> event mechanism: outlets, actions, inlets, whatever. I tried coding
</I>&gt;<i> the app with and without Interface Builder and found it pretty much
</I>&gt;<i> equally hard for different reasons. Any which way, I was making *very*
</I>&gt;<i> slow progress.
</I>&gt;<i> Then I learned about MonoTouch and signed up for the beta. MonoDevelop
</I>&gt;<i> is a bit of a step back from Visual Studio (but then I find Xcode and
</I>&gt;<i> Eclipse also a step back from VS), but MonoTouch and its developers
</I>&gt;<i> and supporters are really fabulous. I'm way ahead on my app since
</I>&gt;<i> starting over with MonoTouch than where I'd be with Xcode, IB, and
</I>&gt;<i> Objective-C.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suppose the hardest thing about MonoTouch should be whether to use
</I>&gt;<i> an iPhone SDK capability or a .Net capability. For some reason, that
</I>&gt;<i> mostly hasn't been a problem for me. If I have to do anything iPhone-
</I>&gt;<i> or UI-specific that I don't yet know about, I read the Apple iPhone
</I>&gt;<i> developer guides and class references while, of course, checking the
</I>&gt;<i> MonoTouch docs to see what's implemented. My tiny bit of Objective-C
</I>&gt;<i> coding has been really helpful with this. Anything that can be done
</I>&gt;<i> C#-style improves my productivity (and attitude). I especially admire
</I>&gt;<i> how MonoTouch developers integrated the type system and events and
</I>&gt;<i> implemented Obj-C delegates.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, I don't use Interface Builder. I find that using
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop and writing the code directly is less complex. With Xcode
</I>&gt;<i> and Objective-C, I never liked having IB do magical stuff for me for
</I>&gt;<i> which I couldn't read the code.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have installed MonoTouch and successfully developed my first app using

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello World tutorial.  It went pretty well.  But now I&#8217;m struggling to
</I>&gt;<i> find
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a way forward.  I should mention that, while I&#8217;m an experienced .NET dev,
</I>&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have no Apple, Unix, or Mono experience.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I downloaded the samples.  I have studied the one with the &#8220;pre made&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; solution file.  I have not found how to &#8220;make&#8221; the files for the others.
</I>&gt;<i>  I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suspect that the &#8220;makefile&#8221; files have something to do with this.  Should
</I>&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just create blank solutions/projects and add all the files manually?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Studying the one sample has not helped me.  It is a very great leap from
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; simple Hello World app.  I simply do not follow how controllers, views,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; windows, data sources, delegates, etc all come together to create a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; functioning app.  I am familiar with the MVC pattern, but I cannot intuit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how it is implemented in this framework by looking at this one sample.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Are there some tutorials I am not seeing that would help me move to the
</I>&gt;<i> next
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; step with MonoTouch?  Maybe if I can look at the other samples, that
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; help. Or should I learn with Objective C first in order to understand the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; framework?  I would guess that there are many learning resources
</I>&gt;<i> available
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks for your feedback.
