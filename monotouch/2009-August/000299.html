<PRE>I tried getting it to work today but there were far too many problems with
generic types because of AOT code gen.  Specifically, the on-the-fly generic
method creation was failing.

Although I tried to come up with some workarounds, things started to get
hairy pretty quick and without knowing the code much better I don't think
it's a quick fix.

Would be nice if it could be made to work though!
