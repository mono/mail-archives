</I>Not sure if I understand what you mean.  Should what work? Running MonoTouch
on Snow Leopard? Or are you referring specifically to protocol buffers?  If
you are referring to MonoTouch on Snow Leopard, then I'll have to let
someone else chime in as I don't the answer.  If referring specifically to
protocol buffers, at this stage the protobuf-net code base in which several
of us have been chatting about getting to work with MonoTouch has yet to be
proven to work.  That doesn't mean it won't.  In fact, there's no known
reason why it shouldn't &quot;just work.&quot;  But up until about 45 minutes ago the
ability to verify one way or another whether or not it will work has been
plagued by the fact that I couldn't even get a simple MonoTouch app to run
in the simulator on my MBP (my primary dev box.) Why that may have been I
really don't know, but picking up a freshly minted MacMini and installing
the 3.0 iPhone SDK + XCode + MonoTouch + MonoDevelop seems to have done the
trick, so at this stage of the game I could really give a fuck why it
wouldn't work and have no plans to find out. ;-) I /finally/ have a
MonoTouch dev machine I can hack on and that's all that matters :-)

So with those last few sentences in mind, as long as I can get the
protobuf-net code base to both compile and work against the MonoTouch libs
then the question as to &quot;will this work on Snow Leopard&quot; is likely answered
by whomever has the answer to whether or not MonoTouch is capable of being
used in conjunction with the iPhone SDK on Snow Leopard.
