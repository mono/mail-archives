Oh, yeah, that's a portion of the ProtocolBuffer specification that as far
as I know will never work with iPhone apps as -- again, as far as I know
(and I assume this is all redundant info to you as well) -- you can't
dynamically create an executable page file which makes the notion of the
on-the-fly code generation and related serialization and deserialization all
but impossible.  Of course, I'd love nothing more than to be proven wrong!

As long as you're dealing with predefined/generated ProtoBuf class files,
then unless there are some MASSIVE differences between what can be
accomplished on Silverlight compared to what can be accomplished on the
iPhone, then there should be very little, if any work to be done.  Of
course, this is assuming limited use of generics within these class files
that fall within the scope of what is and is not directly supported by
mtouch AOT compilation.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would be nice if it could be made to work though!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agreed! Definitely going to require some trial and error, but I think we can
make it work.  Have you been working from SVN HEAD or from the latest
release?
