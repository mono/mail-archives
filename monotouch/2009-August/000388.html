<PRE>This evening I learned a lesson about transferring assumptions from Windows
Mobile &amp; Windows to the iPhone:

I'd been banging my head against a brick wall for the past week trying to
work out why I was having so much trouble with a modal dialog - events not
being triggered, and all properties being null once it was displayed (some
of you have probably worked out the problem already. I could see enough
examples of this sort of thing working to be pretty sure it wasn't a bug in
the framework, so I spent ages trying to find out if the problem was some
arcane feature of the iPhone SDK. Not so much, it turns out.

I use modal dialogs a lot in the .NET Compact Framework (it doesn't give you
a lot of acceptable options), so I'm used to instantiating and using them
within a &quot;using&quot; block as a matter of course.
That was my mistake. Once my dialog had been displayed as far as the code
was concerned the instance no longer existed, with er, hilarious results.
I'm still uncertain whether this is an intrinsic feature of Cocoa Touch or
part of the Cocoa Touch&lt;=&gt;MonoTouch dynamic, but it's worth remembering.
Once I realised what was going on, got rid of my *using* block and instead
added an explicit Dispose() for the modal view controller to the Dispose()
method of the parent everything worked perfectly.

Back to slapping my head and repeating &quot;What are you Kev? You're an idiot&quot;.
