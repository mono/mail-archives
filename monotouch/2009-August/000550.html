<PRE>Hi All,

Really like MonoTouch but would definitely count myself as a newb (to MonoTouch and IPhone Development in general).

One of the things that has helped me (apart from this list) has been twitter and those of you who tweet when you've created a video or blog post about MonoTouch.

Not everyone uses Twitter (and I think tweets only have a certain shelf life via search) so I've put together a site (using Kigg/DotNetShoutOut as a starting point) to keep track of sites/videos etc that may be useful to me and others but is specific to MonoTouch.

I think a site like this could be useful once MonoTouch is released to help people find (and vote) on things that are useful if you are a MonoTouch dev (especially if you are new to it).

Anyway the site is <A HREF="http://monotouch.info">http://monotouch.info</A> and I am currently adding links that are showing up at <A HREF="http://monotouch.info/Upcoming">http://monotouch.info/Upcoming</A> (the related twitter account is monotouchinfo).

It still has a few kinks I'd like to work out and I've got a few ideas for enhancements to make it easier to find information (or related information) but I thought I'd let the list know for general feedback and to give you a heads-up. If you've got something you think is useful that isn't on there feel free to add it.

Since this list is for the beta and dev issues I won't mention it again on this list but thought it worthwhile to just drop this initial email since helping newbies get started has been mentioned on this list.

Cheers,

John
