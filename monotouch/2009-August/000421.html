<PRE>I have the same problem with latest MD and MTb5.Newly added &quot;View Interface
Definition with Controller&quot; did not call overriden in view controller
AwakeFromNib and ViewDidLoad events. I can create it by NIB name, assign it
to the main window view and see it in the simulator. Also action attached to
a button is never called.
While everything in NIB file seems to be well configured and attached to
each other.
Did I missed something or it is a bug?

&gt;<i> As a long time .NET developer who has been doing iPhone development lately,
</I>&gt;<i> I can tell you I'm very excited about MonoTouch.  Excited and very impressed
</I>&gt;<i> with the design of the integration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That being said, I'm having problems getting started with IB and
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop.  I've gone through the &quot;Hello Mono&quot; example and that seems to
</I>&gt;<i> work fine.  I've been attempting to create a simple view.XIB/ViewController
</I>&gt;<i> and load it into the window view, as you would in a &quot;normal&quot; iPhone
</I>&gt;<i> application.  I can get the view to load, however it doesn't seem to link up
</I>&gt;<i> my properties to the outlets or be calling my events such as ViewDidLoad or
</I>&gt;<i> ViewWillAppear.   In my example, I've set my c# class to be the File's
</I>&gt;<i> Owner... is this the correct use?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've done this quite a bit in Objective-C, but I'm struggling with the
</I>&gt;<i> correct approach in MonoTouch.  Is there a simple example out there that
</I>&gt;<i> shows this approach?
</I>&gt;<i>
