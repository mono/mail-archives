<PRE>I have installed MonoTouch and successfully developed my first app using the
Hello World tutorial.  It went pretty well.  But now I&#185;m struggling to find
a way forward.  I should mention that, while I&#185;m an experienced .NET dev, I
have no Apple, Unix, or Mono experience.

I downloaded the samples.  I have studied the one with the &#179;pre made&#178;
solution file.  I have not found how to &#179;make&#178; the files for the others.  I
suspect that the &#179;makefile&#178; files have something to do with this.  Should I
just create blank solutions/projects and add all the files manually?

Studying the one sample has not helped me.  It is a very great leap from the
simple Hello World app.  I simply do not follow how controllers, views,
windows, data sources, delegates, etc all come together to create a
functioning app.  I am familiar with the MVC pattern, but I cannot intuit
how it is implemented in this framework by looking at this one sample.

Are there some tutorials I am not seeing that would help me move to the next
step with MonoTouch?  Maybe if I can look at the other samples, that would
help. Or should I learn with Objective C first in order to understand the
framework?  I would guess that there are many learning resources available
for that.   

Thanks for your feedback.
