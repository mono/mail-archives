Given that the initial MonoTouch bits were based on the Moonlight bits, and
given that protobuf-net runs quite nicely on both Silverlight and Moonlight,
I would be surprised if it didn't just work out of the box.  Of course,
that's never actually the case, but based on my previous experience with
porting the three different C# protobuf projects from a year or so back to
Silveright, each taking about 15 minutes of quick and dirty hacks to
overcome some of the missing
API's, I honestly can't see this is anything more than a few hours of
work to at least get a workable build out into each of your hands.

Of course, the real key would be getting Marc Gravell (the mastermind behind
protobuf-net) involved with this beta.

Miguel: I'm happy to quickly IM him when he comes online in a few hours to
verify the interest, but assuming the interest exists, possible to get a
beta invite sent his direction?  You probably have his address due to your
participation last year in the early days of the proto-buf developers list,
but if not I'd be happy to make a quick intro.  He's doing some incredibly
cool stuff in the the MVC, raw TCP sockets, and HTTP space that I think
could really help push the limits of efficiency for a broad range of data
intensive peer-to-peer applications.
