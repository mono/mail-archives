<PRE>&quot;where it can be&quot; is the issue, there's no documentation on what works
and what doesn't other than LINQ probably won't work. The fact is all
I have to work with is the simulator for the time being, so I don't
even know if there'll be issues or not. Documentation and/or a
compiler error would be a start in the right direction.
