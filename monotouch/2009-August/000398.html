<PRE>Hello Ethan

Are you using the latest MonoDevelop (from yesterday)?
<A HREF="http://go-mono.com/archive/MonoDevelop-MonoTouch-Preview-20090821-0.dmg">http://go-mono.com/archive/MonoDevelop-MonoTouch-Preview-20090821-0.dmg</A>

I was having this problem in a &quot;View Interface Definition with Controller&quot; that I had
created with an earlier MonoDevelop build that had the default view configured wrong
in the template.  Creating the View with the latest MonoDevelop sets up the File's Owner
class correctly, and now creating outlets in the File's Owner generates the properties
correctly. 

Hope that helps
Joseph

&gt;<i> As a long time .NET developer who has been doing iPhone development lately, 
</I>&gt;<i> I can tell you I'm very excited about MonoTouch.  Excited and very impressed 
</I>&gt;<i> with the design of the integration. 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> That being said, I'm having problems getting started with IB and 
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop.  I've gone through the &quot;Hello Mono&quot; example and that seems to 
</I>&gt;<i> work fine.  I've been attempting to create a simple view.XIB/ViewController 
</I>&gt;<i> and load it into the window view, as you would in a &quot;normal&quot; iPhone 
</I>&gt;<i> application.  I can get the view to load, however it doesn't seem to link up 
</I>&gt;<i> my properties to the outlets or be calling my events such as ViewDidLoad or 
</I>&gt;<i> ViewWillAppear.   In my example, I've set my c# class to be the File's 
</I>&gt;<i> Owner... is this the correct use? 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I've done this quite a bit in Objective-C, but I'm struggling with the 
</I>&gt;<i> correct approach in MonoTouch.  Is there a simple example out there that 
</I>&gt;<i> shows this approach? 
</I>&gt;<i>
