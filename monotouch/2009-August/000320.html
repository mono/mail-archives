While as of yet there is no specified mime-type for protocol buffers,
application/x-protobuf seems to be the most logical as far as telling the
client via the Content-Type header that the response has been serialized in
the protobuf format. 

 

FYI... After researching the current state of the protobuf mime-type
conversation and realizing that there really hasn't been much discussion,
and certainly no accepted resolution, I decided to post the following reply
to the only thread I could find that touched on this subject in any detail: 

 

<A HREF="http://groups.google.com/group/protobuf/browse_thread/thread/540a09f87b60a40">http://groups.google.com/group/protobuf/browse_thread/thread/540a09f87b60a40</A>
2/88c4f9f73f5ff515?hl=en#88c4f9f73f5ff515

 

In short, my proposal is summarized by: Given that the usage of HTTP headers
is, quite obvious, transport specific an effort should be made to adopt an
transport agnostic-friendly solution that combines mime types with a format
that has worked well for other dynamically driven spaces where name clashes
are inevitable, that of using the tld.domain.classpath.type format adopted
by the Java community to ensure that my application/foo+protobuf and your
application/foo+protobuf can easily co-exist by simply using
application/com.mydomain.foo+protobuf and
application/com.yourdomain.foo+protobuf

 

Oh, and yes, I do recognize the fact that I both used the word Java and
suggested adopting the classpath naming convention to a list filled with
.NET heavyweights. My reasoning? I have yet to meet a .NET OSS developer who
chooses religion over common sense. And to me, anyway, at least as it
relates to this particular problem space, using the
tld.domain.classpath.Type as part of a protobuf mime-type seems to make the
most sense if your ultimate goal is to implement a solution that is
transport-protocol agnostic.

 

Of course, this forum is obviously not the right place to be carrying on the
'what mime-type to use for protobuf's and when' conversation, so if you do
have thoughts on the matter please subscribed to the protobuf-discuss
group[1] if you're not already and respond directly to the thread mentioned
above.

 

Thanks!
