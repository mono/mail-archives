<PRE>Hello,

    Since you signed up to participate on the MonoTouch Beta program, we
have added you to the <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monotouch">monotouch at lists.ximian.com</A> mailing list.  If you
want to remove yourself from the list, go to this address:

	<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monotouch">http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monotouch</A>

* MonoTouch Offering

    MonoTouch will be a commercial offering from Novell.    We have not
finalized the pricing yet, but we will share that information with the
group when it is available, but it will be similar to pricing to
commercial .NET components and .NET tools.

* Beta Program

    We would appreciate if you report the problems that you run into in
this mailing list.    We have also be setting up Bugzilla for larger
bugs, but to get things started quickly this list will do.  

    The beta is considered feature complete, but it will likely have
bugs, and we likely are missing some .NET bindings to the Objective-C
APIs that are important.    Please notify us on the list of any
incomplete bindings and we will release new versions/workaround to aid
your adoption of MonoTouch.

    As you have noticed there is no NDA to get started with MonoTouch,
but we would appreciate if you give us at least a chance to fix or
address problems for a few days before writing something negative on the
blogosphere.

   Although the software availability is protected by a password, it is
a mechanism easy to circumvent.   We are not making this public just so
we can work with the few selected folks for the beta and have a chance
of answering your questions and addressing bugs.   

    Although we are feature complete, there are various size and
performance features that we want to add and they might just make it
into 1.0.

* Getting Started

    To get you started, you will want to read the information on:

	<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/MonoTouch_Beta">http://www.mono-project.com/MonoTouch_Beta</A>

    It has various pointers on how to get started.

    To download the MonoTouch beta, go to:

	<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/MonoTouch_Installation">http://www.mono-project.com/MonoTouch_Installation</A>

    You will need a login and password to download the MonoTouch beta,
this is it:

	Username: monotouch-beta
	Password: eH3ootu2

   Thank you for joining the beta program!

Miguel.

</PRE>
