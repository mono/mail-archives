&gt;<i> Hi all,

</I>&gt;<i> Having tweeted Geoff with this question earlier, (he request I post to
</I>&gt;<i> the list), I have a few questions about the Beta.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Is there any info on the licensing for the Beta? (which probably
</I>&gt;<i> leads to question 2...)
</I>
You should refer to the license in the installer for the details, but  
the license is a time-limited preview with a no-go-live restriction.

&gt;<i> 2) What are we allowed to do with the exes we build? (i.e. commercial
</I>&gt;<i> deployment? App store submission/sales?)
</I>
App store submission is not allowed.

&gt;<i> 3) Are the tools time limited? (as in, will they expire and cease to
</I>&gt;<i> function at some point or are exes in any way time limited?)
</I>
Yes.  We will ensure that new builds come out to extend the time limit  
or the commercial product is ready before the time limit arises.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All of these stem from an assumption that I should not be writing
</I>&gt;<i> releasable code with the current tools because at some point something
</I>&gt;<i> will expire or I will be breaking a term in a licensing agreement
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere. However, being extremely excited about the tools, I want to
</I>&gt;<i> write serious code and complete a couple of small projects I have been
</I>&gt;<i> holding off on. If the Beta is restricted in use, it would be good to
</I>&gt;<i> know ahead of time, especially prior to any official licensing and
</I>&gt;<i> pricing announcement for the finished product.
</I>
The only real issue here is we do reserve the right thru the beta to  
move/break/shuffle the api, so there may be some breaking changes.

I hope that answered your questions.
