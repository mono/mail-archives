<PRE>Hi all,

Having tweeted Geoff with this question earlier, (he request I post to 
the list), I have a few questions about the Beta.

1) Is there any info on the licensing for the Beta? (which probably 
leads to question 2...)
2) What are we allowed to do with the exes we build? (i.e. commercial 
deployment? App store submission/sales?)
3) Are the tools time limited? (as in, will they expire and cease to 
function at some point or are exes in any way time limited?)

All of these stem from an assumption that I should not be writing 
releasable code with the current tools because at some point something 
will expire or I will be breaking a term in a licensing agreement 
somewhere. However, being extremely excited about the tools, I want to 
write serious code and complete a couple of small projects I have been 
holding off on. If the Beta is restricted in use, it would be good to 
know ahead of time, especially prior to any official licensing and 
pricing announcement for the finished product.

I hope not to start a big debate, but am looking for comment from 
Miguel, Geoff or someone at Novell who can give more info/insight.

Thanks,

M
</PRE>
