&gt;<i> I think the Checkbox idea might be quite good. I too have been struggling with this because it's a bit odd having the interface in IB saying Controller but it also makes sense for the code-behind to be controller.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Problem is, if they don't match, will MD still understand to group them together in the treeview?
</I>
That would be pretty easy to fix. Grouping is based on the &quot;DependsOn&quot;
MSBuild element, which is set by the file template (though the
IPhoneProject has some magic to set this up on existing files when you
add them).

I'd rather not support both though. I think that would be even more
confusing for newcomers.

&gt;<i> The templates for various views is a good idea. Allows people to setup new projects with navigation controllers and the &quot;root view controller&quot; also additionally being constructed.
</I>
Yup. The problem is, as I haven't built substantial MonoTouch apps
myself, I'm not sure what kinds of things people really need in their
templates. I guess this is something that can grow and evolve over
time as best practices emerge from experience.

&gt;<i> I am also hitting another issue related to navigation controllers when hooking it up myself. In XCode there is a concept of groups (they are like folders) but they don't actually save files in folders. It just allows you to organize your code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, I decided to create a navigation controller based app, I then created in MD folder called &quot;Views&quot;, and decided to organize my controllers in there. I pointed the navigation view controllers root view to another view which I created into the &quot;Views&quot; folder. When running the app it cannot find this view, it says it is unable to load the NIB file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unhandled Exception: MonoTouch.Foundation.MonoTouchException: Objective-C exception thrown. &#160;Name: NSInvalidArgumentException Reason: -[UIViewController _loadViewFromNibNamed:bundle:] was unable to load a nib named &quot;MainViewController&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After googling I found:<A HREF="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/906360/referencing-a-nib-file-in-a-subfolder-of-an-xcode-compiled-cocoa-app-bundle">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/906360/referencing-a-nib-file-in-a-subfolder-of-an-xcode-compiled-cocoa-app-bundle</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I'm wondering. Is there anything we can do/add to MD that can allow us to organize our views? I'm not sure if this is something the codegen of the designer.cs file just needs to handle or not.
</I>
I guess there are a few options. MD could put views into the root of
the bundle regardless of their path within your project (though that
seems hacky) or we could figure out the magic needed to load views
from subdirs and add supporting code to the generator or file
templates.

&gt;<i> Only other item I can remember at the moment is the resources issue we discussed on IRC about not being able to use images in IB. I believe you discovered a xcode project needs to be generated for IB to pick up resources in our projects we build in MD.
</I>
Yes. I'm still trying to figure out how to handle this while taking
into account localization and generation of XCode projects for
gdb-debugging (which should be per-configuration).

&gt;<i> Thanks for being so accessible and open to feedback with us. I am really enjoying being a part of this preview.
</I>
Thanks for providing great feedback!
