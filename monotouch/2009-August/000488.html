<PRE>Hey Ois&#237;n,
I think that&#146;s actually a brilliant sample for demonstrating the usefulness
of MonoTouch (because I know there are people who are asking &#147;What possible
reason could anyone have for wanting to do iPhone development in any
language other than Objective-C, the language vouchsafed unto us by Apple?&#148;.

Just compare the beautiful simplicity of exposing a C# event and hooking it
up with the involved process of configuring the protocol in the original
version.
It makes setting up modal dialogs on the iPhone much less of a chore.

So, here it is (attached).

I have no idea if this is based on any kind of best practices but this is my
first attempt to write anything half significant in MD (and tbh, for the
iphone in general) and I am impressed with experience. 

The project works exactly the same way as the out of box &quot;Utility Project&quot;
template in XCode. One main view with an information-style &quot;i&quot; button on the
bottom right, and then a flipped over modal view with a navigation bar and a
&quot;Done&quot; button which flips back to the main view.

Hilariously, while MD was rock solid during this process, XCode 3.1 crashed
while I was flipping back and forth looking at their project template. This
made me even more determined to continue this process. That said, I lost
intellisense today after the latest upgrade, but still managed to get it the
job done.

Great work, and please feel free to take this project and clean it up and do
what you want with it (i'd love to see this project template added to MD).

To MD developers,

As my introductory/learning project I'm porting the &quot;Utility Project&quot;
template from Xcode (the one with the flipside view) to MD. When it works
exactly like the XCode one, I'll post it back here for inclusion (if you
wish) in an MD drop in the future. I think you guys are better off spending
time working on real meat and leave the easy stuff to us noobs. I hope I can
contribute more significantly when I get up to speed later.

Thanks again,

-Oisin
