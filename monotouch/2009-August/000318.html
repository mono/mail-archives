&gt;<i> Nothing stops you if your writing a REST service to your iPhone app to

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Nothing that I can think of.  And by using the HTTP Accept header your
iPhone application can specify which format(s) it can accept for the
response which makes it brain dead simple to tell the server when to respond
with a particular format when at all possible.  Of course, setting aside
order of precedence at it relates to the mime-types specify in the Accept
header, you can add server side logic into the equation to determine which
client supported format makes the most sense to return in the response body
based on whatever criteria you might feel appropriate. While as of yet there
is no specified mime-type for protocol buffers, application/x-protobuf seems
to be the most logical as far as telling the client via the Content-Type
header that the response has been serialized in the protobuf format.

&gt;<i> If your using large data ProtoBuf might make sense simply for the
</I>&gt;<i> deserialization speed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yep. In fact, the only time I /wouldn't/ use protocol buffers is when you
plan to do transform the returned data into something else via XSLT which,
quite obviously, would mean returning XML. That said, if you'd rather chew
on glass that write in XSLT (blasphemy! ;-)) and/or LINQ to Objects is more
than enough to get the transformation job done, then, once again, protocol
buffers make a lot of sense.
