<PRE>That makes a lot of sense for your audience.  Anything to improve symmetry
across the ever expanding set of platforms is a good thing as far as I'm
concerned.  Right now I'm having to abstract things at a higher level but it
would be nice not to have to do it wherever possible.
As far as the constants - maybe in the interim you could just let the API's
use the existing constant subsets that you identified from Windows.  I'm no
expert on OpenGL but I would guess that the manifest constant identifiers
aren't allowed to change?  The only down side would be that you would
potentially have too many constants I guess.  That would certainly help in
the transition if it's possible.

cheers,
-chris
