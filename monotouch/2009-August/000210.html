<PRE>I'm a little bit of the opposite side of the fence on this one. I think options are good. One thing I am unclear of is why certain things aren't included in this version versus the next drop we are receiving etc.

Since statically compiling it should not include code from assemblies we do not utilize (is that true?) is there hurt in giving us options? Our code base has a significant investment in Compact Framework 2.0 based API's such as XmlDocument and others. Probably 4 or so years worth of code. We like to keep code reuse very high if possible. I would estimate about 90% of our code base is shared in our core system on many platforms.

Is there a big challenge when it comes to making these assemblies compatible on MonoTouch? Perhaps I am simply ignorant of some incompatibility issues that these raise :)

Thanks and take care,
Simon

No, AFAICT it's been managed for about 6 years.

Even better! I'm not sure why I thought this, but am glad to hear I was wrong. :-)

I don't know if we had
one at all before then - IMO an unmanaged XSLT implementation would be
bad idea, as marshalling the XmlDocument would be horrible (most
likely via a giant string copy &amp; reparsing).

Oh, I most certainly agree.  As per above, I'm very happy to hear I had bad information stored upstairs. ;-)

That wouldn't really save you much anyway. In order to use the
System.Xml.Xsl API, you'd also need XmlDocument and XPathNavigator
etc.

True, though I do believe a bit of rethinking on the design of the System.Xml.Xsl namespace could potentially be justified in a space that MSFT has made no known effort to define the baseline standard via their own implementation.  In other words, given this is completely virgin territory it may be worth considering dropping support for XmlDocument and placing focus on the Linq specific extensions in System.Xml.XPath which, quite obviously, places the focus on the Linq specific XNode.
