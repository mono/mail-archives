<PRE>Hi,

To try and answer your first question in short, I would go with TCP.

Now for the longer answer. UDP is a disconnected protocol and TCP is a 
connected protocol, which means bassicly that with an TCP connection you get 
the following for free:

1) You know when an connection is actually made.
2) You know when an connection gets disconnected.
3) Packets (your data) will be received in the same order as they are send.

If you are using UDP you will have to deal with all the three points 
yourself.

Hop this helps you a bit,
Richard.

Subject: Re: [MonoTouch] Audio streaming between iOS and Windows

Hi

Actually i am working with UDP in this application and yesterday my
application successfully worked for me without any problem, both
applications on iOS Device and Windows can send and receive data. When i saw
this, i thrilled :D and after that i tried to apply the following process to
stream Windows screen.

  1  There is a Thread in windows side application that captures screen as a
Jpeg file (could be anything) and
     converts it to byte[] then send it. (Here is my problem)

  2  In iOS side application, i have a Thread that always is waiting for
data(s) to receive. when byte[]   receives, convert it to UIImage and
display it using &lt;my image viewer&gt;.Image=&lt;my instance of UIImage&gt;

Here i have a question and a problem :D

At first an error comes to me in Sending images, that is because of UDP
limitation of byte[] (2500) so that either i should divide my byte array to
for example three parts and then send them and client should first get the
bytes and after that, package them or i should use TCP. What is your opinion
?

And the second question is when byes are received is it convertible to
instance of UIImage?

Thanks
