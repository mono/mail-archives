<PRE>Hi John,

Might a make a suggestion? You might try installing Xcode 3.2.6, MonoDevelop
2.4.2 and MonoTouch 4.0.4.1 if you want to work through Wally's samples.
This combination should cause you the least amount of headaches. Right now
you are using alpha releases of MonoDevelop and MonoTouch which is sure to
bring maximum pain and suffering to someone less familiar with the ins and
outs of MonoTouch development (and even those who *are* more familiar!).

Jeff
