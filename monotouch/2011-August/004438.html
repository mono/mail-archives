<PRE>Doesn't make the slightest difference - still get null reference exception

Also doens't explain why it worked in previous version of MD and touch 

 

Also I have tried loading several examples from the Wally B etc book which
worked fine before - I simply get SIGSEGV errors trying to run them 

 

Thanks anyway 

Yours in further desperation

the first thing I'd try is to move the declaration &quot;var ppvc&quot; from your
local scope and declare it at the class level instead.

I downloaded monotouch 4 and 2.8 of MD this morning after a prompt from MD

 

My app has a view which requires user to enter name and address info 

It has a button which allows user to pick from the contacts list 

Code lifted straight from Wally B's book 

It's worked fine until now - I mean last night fine - this morning after
upgrade No 

 

It is undebuggable - cannot even get to a break point simply drops out with
green line at UIApplication.Main(args)

As I say I've not changed code overnight.

The trace shows it failing on monotouch.utils.backingField.get 

In developer/monotouch/source/monotouch/src/utils/backingField.cs line 47

 

I'd be the first to admit my code is not exactly expert - I do hope this is
a fault in the new version rather than I have to go to college for 10 years
to discover how to do it properly as every new developer tool/evolution
seems to get more complicatedJ 

 

It seem simple enough - I cant imagine what I am doing wrong and why it only
comes out now after the upgrade

 

A button calls 

-          paxViewController.PresentModalViewController(ppvc,true) ;

the ppvc is declared like this 

 

                var ppvc = new ABPeoplePickerNavigationController();

 

and then it has a few override methods e.g. 

ppvc.SelectPerson+=delegate(object
sender,ABPeoplePickerSelectPersonEventArgs e)

{

//do something 

//dismiss modal 

paxViewController.DismissModalViewControllerAnimated(true);

};

 

And that's all there is to it -   as I say it doesn't even get to these
lines - on touching the contact (any contact) to select it drops out with
nullreference exception

And no clue as to what is causing it 

are there changes in monotouch4 which mean I have to do things differently?

 

Desperate for help here - completely out of my depth.
