<PRE>&gt;<i> Since image processing is largely CPU intensive (and normally done using
</I>&gt;<i> SIMD - which, sadly, MonoTouch does not support (maybe a feature for a
</I>&gt;<i> future version?)), this might be a task best suited for a native library or
</I>&gt;<i> something. Then again, maybe Apple's CoreImage does what you need, in which
</I>&gt;<i> case MonoTouch's binding should already have what you need as well (and
</I>&gt;<i> there should be no significant overhead).
</I>
this is the big thing. If you are calling into native iOS CocoaTouch
functions, there might be a very minor overhead calling the method,
but after that, it's 1:1 with objc, 'cos it's the _same code_ which is
being run.

Now, if you are writing your own image manipulation lib's, then.....
dont. Unless you really need to. And even then: dont.

:<i>)
</I>
CocoaTouch is SO SO SO rich - and even more so with the Mono framework
there too - chances are you can do pretty much everything with what
you have there already, with no perf hit
