<PRE>Further to the saga 

I thought I would start from scratch with a one view (hello world) one
button and try to call  the people picker code 

 

The new version of MD does not behave as per the tutorials on Xamarin 

 

The tutorial there for hello world using interface builder says that one
should open a new iphone window-based  project 

There is no such option now in MD2.8 a

 

Any other project opens up but does not have a 'mainwindow.xib' which one
can open in interface builder 

I have become a bit of a slave to this - y'know go into i/b desing your view
- click on appdelegate in library/classes and create outlets then link 'em
to your objects

All worked well but of course when the mainwindow.xib was created for you

Now I know you can add a xib but when you add your own xib's and open them
in i/b I can't find the 'appdelegate' under Library/classes to create the
outlets 

-          I presume there must be some other way of doing it 

Anyway the tutorials are out of date

My many months of learning are now somewhat up the creek without a paddle

Jeff 

That sounds as if it's on the money  

Now apologies for being a dumbo - I frequently can't get beyond the autism
of functional programming - 

How exactly do I 'hold a reference to ppvc' elsewhere ? This sounds a bit
like Jason' ssuggestion of declaring ppvc at class level 

I mean in really painfully idiot terms - do I declare it somewhere at the
start of the code - make it static or something ? 

 

Presumably when I 'dismissmodalcontroller' - thinking I'm just knocking a
form off the stack then it is destroyed then the code goes looking for it in
case it is called up again and it's not there? Is that it ?  (y'see I need
it explained in two year old terms) 

 

Is there any way other than using 'dismissmodalcontroller' - it's being
called from a view controller and that doesn't have a popview method

 

//// update - while I've been writing this I've commented out the line
DismissModalViewControllerAimated and - no change - still falls over with
null referenceobject

 

So obviously this doesn't work at all - it's not the dismissing the ppvc
that is causing the problem 

 

The code is word for word as per examples in &quot;iPhone Programming with
MonoTouch and.Net/C#&quot; 

If things are now so different in 4.1 I need a new example of how to call up
the people/contacts

 

Thanks for your help anyway - helps me feel less panicky J -

Hi John,

 

DismissModalViewController() now clears the parent's ModalViewController
property, which, if that is the only reference that still exists for your
ppvc, will be lost (cleared to null). What you need to do is make sure you
hold a reference to that object elsewhere.

 

This is one of the fixes in the 4.1 beta branch which is needed to more
accurately reflect the state of the underlying objects. The reason it
happened to work because is because we wrongly kept the ModalViewController
property cached which prevented expected garbage collection when the modal
view was dismissed.

 

For more information, see <A HREF="http://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=172">http://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=172</A>

 

Hope that helps,

 

Jeff

Doesn't make the slightest difference - still get null reference exception

Also doens't explain why it worked in previous version of MD and touch 

 

Also I have tried loading several examples from the Wally B etc book which
worked fine before - I simply get SIGSEGV errors trying to run them 

 

Thanks anyway 

Yours in further desperation

the first thing I'd try is to move the declaration &quot;var ppvc&quot; from your
local scope and declare it at the class level instead.

I downloaded monotouch 4 and 2.8 of MD this morning after a prompt from MD

 

My app has a view which requires user to enter name and address info 

It has a button which allows user to pick from the contacts list 

Code lifted straight from Wally B's book 

It's worked fine until now - I mean last night fine - this morning after
upgrade No 

 

It is undebuggable - cannot even get to a break point simply drops out with
green line at UIApplication.Main(args)

As I say I've not changed code overnight.

The trace shows it failing on monotouch.utils.backingField.get 

In developer/monotouch/source/monotouch/src/utils/backingField.cs line 47

 

I'd be the first to admit my code is not exactly expert - I do hope this is
a fault in the new version rather than I have to go to college for 10 years
to discover how to do it properly as every new developer tool/evolution
seems to get more complicatedJ 

 

It seem simple enough - I cant imagine what I am doing wrong and why it only
comes out now after the upgrade

 

A button calls 

-          paxViewController.PresentModalViewController(ppvc,true) ;

the ppvc is declared like this 

 

                var ppvc = new ABPeoplePickerNavigationController();

 

and then it has a few override methods e.g. 

ppvc.SelectPerson+=delegate(object
sender,ABPeoplePickerSelectPersonEventArgs e)

{

//do something 

//dismiss modal 

paxViewController.DismissModalViewControllerAnimated(true);

};

 

And that's all there is to it -   as I say it doesn't even get to these
lines - on touching the contact (any contact) to select it drops out with
nullreference exception

And no clue as to what is causing it 

are there changes in monotouch4 which mean I have to do things differently?

 

Desperate for help here - completely out of my depth.
