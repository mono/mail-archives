<PRE>This is addressed at both Wally and Xamarin people 

I have posted an initial problem regarding a complete drop out after
upgrading to version 4.101 and MD2.8a  - now when using people picker with
Wally book code.

I can't even get near it with a debug  - just a null reference exception=
worked before with NO changes since - a couple of kind people made some
suggestions none of which work  but stony silence from Xamarin  see other
thread

 

I realise this is bleeding edge and one is largely unsupported L so I bought
your book Wally and have devoured it 

Take pages 22 to 26  - Setting up outlets and hello world with i/b

This has served me well  in previous versions of MD and touch.

 

Now with MD 2.8a - may have happened  earlier but I didn't notice it - when
one sets up a new solution there is no 'mainwindow.xib' as stated on the
middle of page 22 to open in I/b- pls read your own book.

Yes of course one can create a new xib and open that but you cannot as
stated on page 22 'select AppDelegate'  from the classes tab - it simply
does not exist 

What the hell is going on. It used to work exactly as in the book. So how
exactly do you link outlets via interface builder and reference them in your
c# code (I thought that was what it was all about)  

 

The tutorial for hello world in interface builder  which is posted on the
Xamarin site does not function  because in my installed version of MD2.8a
there is no such thing as an iphone windows-based project - any project
template you can open does not create a mainwindow.xib

The only template on offer are 

Monotouch project t- iphone 

Monotouch project t-utility application iphone 

Ditto - master detail appl

Ditto single view app

Ditto tabbed app

Ditto opengl app

 

As I said none of these create a 'mainwindow.xib'

 

 

I have worked my way through things with a little outside help over the last
six months, I have bought the books and read widely  and thought I was on
the verge of releasing something - Jeeez if the rug can be pulled this
easily. ....

 

And for what it's worth if you're interested Wally - I can get none of your
examples to work under MD2.8a and 4.101

 

I am sure it is something simple or idiotic I am doing but Please can anyone
help 

And yes - it is late I have worked 12 hours today and I am massively cheesed
off.- L

John Murray

PS 

And just to add insult to injury I've discovered that xcode 4.3 does away
with interface builder - a whole  new learning curve
