<PRE>Hi, I recently read Professional iPhone Programming with MonoTouch and
.NET/C#. For the most part I think it was a great book (especially for
reference), however, I still have many questions regarding the UI of
applications. I have followed many tutorials for monotouch.info, however, I
still can't seem to quite grasp it.

1. Can someone please explain to me the difference between a controller and
the actual item (a data view and a controller). What functionality does the
data view have on it's own and what is the purpose of the controller? To
push the view away when no longer needed?

2. Do the controllers come with a default class to build off of, or do we
have to program them manually? 

3. When creating a massive navigation scheme (ex. a tab bar with navigation
screens for each one), what do you have as the base class?

4. The book mentioned nothing of MySQL or anything like that (I don't want
to use a web-based service like SOAP or REST). How do I go about allowing
that functionality to store data?

Sorry. I'm like really lost when it comes to navigation and UI building.
This is frustrating to me because I believe I comprehend everything but the
UI part. Which sucks. 

If anyone could help me on Skype or send me in the right direction at least
that would be great. If someone can simply walk me through on video (I'm
more of a hands-on/visual learner), they would be my hero.

One last question, I'm a college student and I noticed there is a student
package. However, this does not feature distribution. $399 is VERY expensive
for a college student so I was wondering if there was a combination of the
two! 

Once again, I appreciate all the help! Thanks!
