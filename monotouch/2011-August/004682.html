<PRE>Thanks for the reply, but I am using XCode 3.2.6 and there is NO visible
support for adding outlets. The only visible support for adding actions
fails to produce anything in the C# code. There's obvisouly missing
fuctionality in XCode/IB 3.2.6 in regards to outlets and obviously something
broken in code sync between IB and MT.

I'm willing to accept that I'm doing something wrong, because obviously
others are using MT and not having this issue. If I'm doing something wrong
then the documentation for MT and IB and a half dozen videos on youtube are
invalid, because I've been following them and it simply doesn't work.

BTW: I've tried installing XCode 4 along side XCode 3 and manually
specifying that XIB files open with IB 3.2.6 and that doesn't work either.
The outlets support doesn't seem to exist in IB 3.2.6 and apparently Apple
intends for devs to declare the outlets in code and then open the XIB and IB
will resolve the IBOutlet in code to a linkable component in the designer.
Following that logic I attempted to declare a UIButton variable in code and
then build the solution and then open the XIB, but this also doesn't work.

I've since clean installed my Mac (after updates it's snow leapord 10.6.8 by
the way) and followed the pre-reqs stated on the MT site for a
clean-as-possible install.

Still no joy.
