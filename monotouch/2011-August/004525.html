</I>&gt;<i> Thanks. I think #2 will not cut it for the client's needs. Is there
</I>&gt;<i> anything one can do to mitigate the battery drainage of #1? Like using
</I>&gt;<i> cell tower/wifi for location instead of GPS? (This app will only be used
</I>&gt;<i> in urban settings anyway.) And maybe increasing the polling interval? I
</I>&gt;<i> don't need the precision of something like Runkeeper.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Nope. You might be able to get better battery by asking for a less
accurate location, but I'm not sure. You'll have to give it a go :)

That said, I've used Runkeeper (which does this) for 2 hours,
constantly (when cycling) and it uses maybe 1/8th of the battery of my
iPhone 4. So it's not THAT bad.

BTW, it's not polling. You are running all the time (I think!) and get
a call back on the CLLocationManager for changes.

&gt;<i> Anything in particular with this concept that you think would make them
</I>&gt;<i> disapprove?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
They are a bit picky about background apps running (and often there
can only be one background app running I think?). They allow
GPS/navigation, streaming audio and a few other types, and you might
fit into the GPS option. But to be honest, I don't know. The
guidelines are here:

That said, the reminders app does this (it's built into iOS5), so it
can be done :) But you can't find out HOW they do it.... even if you
could get the binary :(

Would you expect the user to be running this app all the time?

I've done the &quot;update when the phone is off&quot; thing in MonoTouch. It
worked, but I ended up not implementing it in my app because it was
overkill for what I needed.



these might help too:
