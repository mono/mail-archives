<PRE>Hi

Actually i am working with UDP in this application and yesterday my
application successfully worked for me without any problem, both
applications on iOS Device and Windows can send and receive data. When i saw
this, i thrilled :D and after that i tried to apply the following process to
stream Windows screen.

  1  There is a Thread in windows side application that captures screen as a
Jpeg file (could be anything) and 
     converts it to byte[] then send it. (Here is my problem)
  
  2  In iOS side application, i have a Thread that always is waiting for
data(s) to receive. when byte[]   receives, convert it to UIImage and
display it using &lt;my image viewer&gt;.Image=&lt;my instance of UIImage&gt;

Here i have a question and a problem :D

At first an error comes to me in Sending images, that is because of UDP
limitation of byte[] (2500) so that either i should divide my byte array to
for example three parts and then send them and client should first get the
bytes and after that, package them or i should use TCP. What is your opinion
?

And the second question is when byes are received is it convertible to
instance of UIImage?

Thanks
