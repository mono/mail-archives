<PRE>Jeff

I really appreciate you getting back to me 

When I have any knowledge which is useful I will try to share with community
and repay the favour

 

I've walked away from it for a day - too much steam coming out of ears

I have started reinstalling MD2.4 xcode 3.5 etc etc 

So assuming I am successful with that I'll be back to where I was a few days
ago 

 

Thanks anyway 

John Murray

Hi John,

 

Might a make a suggestion? You might try installing Xcode 3.2.6, MonoDevelop
2.4.2 and MonoTouch 4.0.4.1 if you want to work through Wally's samples.
This combination should cause you the least amount of headaches. Right now
you are using alpha releases of MonoDevelop and MonoTouch which is sure to
bring maximum pain and suffering to someone less familiar with the ins and
outs of MonoTouch development (and even those who *are* more familiar!).

 

Jeff
