<PRE>I recently experienced an issue where an app would build just fine, but when
I attempted to run the app in the emulator it would not install.

I was boggled by this and tried all manner of project settings and resetting
the emulator, everything I could think of to get the app to deploy to the
emulator.

After a couple hours I starting thinking backward on what I had done to the
project itself since it was created. I slowly started working backward
through my changes and undoing them one at a time and testing at each point
along the way to find the breaking change.

Eventually I changed the project name in MonoDevelop back to the original
name (which matched the folder containing the project file) and it worked. I
started reintroducing my changes one at a time, leaving the project with its
original name. I was able to use all of my changes except the project name
change.

If you encounter a failure to launch on the emulator and there are no error,
warning, or informational logs and it just doesn&#8217;t make sense; I suggest
first renaming the project in MonoDevelop to match the folder name that
contains the project (which is how the project was created to begin with).

Perhaps this could be logged as a minor bug and addressed in a future
release. I personally don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a big deal; there isn&#8217;t any obvious
tie between the project name and the display name once you&#8217;ve taken a moment
to actually set the display name.

Happy Coding!
