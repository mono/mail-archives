<PRE>As with anything, &quot;it depends&quot;.

File I/O should be as fast as buffered native I/O (I did a fair bit of
testing of this for Mono a few years ago).

Most of what apps do is spent idling waiting for user events and idle time
is idle time and using the MonoTouch APIs is (for the most part) just a thin
wrapper around the iOS Touch APIs so there is very little overhead at all
there.

Of course, if you do some intensive inner-loop processing, depending on what
type of processing you are doing, you might be better off calling into a
native library, but, then again, you might be able to get equivalent
performance by simply refactoring that loop and/or using 'unsafe' code.
Since C#/Mono make it trivial to call out to native code later once you've
done some performance testing and found the hotspot to be in said loop, it's
not really an issue (if you had to pick C# or C and couldn't use both,
*that* would be a cause for concern).

Since image processing is largely CPU intensive (and normally done using
SIMD - which, sadly, MonoTouch does not support (maybe a feature for a
future version?)), this might be a task best suited for a native library or
something. Then again, maybe Apple's CoreImage does what you need, in which
case MonoTouch's binding should already have what you need as well (and
there should be no significant overhead).
