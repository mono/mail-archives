&gt;<i> This is addressed at both Wally and Xamarin people
</I>&gt;<i> I have posted an initial problem regarding a complete drop out after upgrading to version 4.101 and MD2.8a  - now when using people picker with Wally book code.
</I>&gt;<i> I can&#8217;t even get near it with a debug  - just a null reference exception= worked before with NO changes since &#8211; a couple of kind people made some suggestions none of which work  but stony silence from Xamarin  see other thread
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I realise this is bleeding edge and one is largely unsupported L so I bought your book Wally and have devoured it
</I>&gt;<i> Take pages 22 to 26  - Setting up outlets and hello world with i/b
</I>&gt;<i> This has served me well  in previous versions of MD and touch.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Now with MD 2.8a &#8211; may have happened  earlier but I didn&#8217;t notice it &#8211; when one sets up a new solution there is no &#8216;mainwindow.xib&#8217; as stated on the middle of page 22 to open in I/b- pls read your own book.
</I>&gt;<i> Yes of course one can create a new xib and open that but you cannot as stated on page 22 &#8216;select AppDelegate&#8217;  from the classes tab &#8211; it simply does not exist
</I>&gt;<i> What the hell is going on. It used to work exactly as in the book. So how exactly do you link outlets via interface builder and reference them in your c# code (I thought that was what it was all about)  
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> The tutorial for hello world in interface builder  which is posted on the Xamarin site does not function  because in my installed version of MD2.8a there is no such thing as an iphone windows-based project &#8211; any project template you can open does not create a mainwindow.xib
</I>&gt;<i> The only template on offer are
</I>&gt;<i> Monotouch project t- iphone
</I>&gt;<i> Monotouch project t-utility application iphone
</I>&gt;<i> Ditto &#8211; master detail appl
</I>&gt;<i> Ditto single view app
</I>&gt;<i> Ditto tabbed app
</I>&gt;<i> Ditto opengl app
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> As I said none of these create a &#8216;mainwindow.xib&#8217;
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I have worked my way through things with a little outside help over the last six months, I have bought the books and read widely  and thought I was on the verge of releasing something &#8211; Jeeez if the rug can be pulled this easily. ....
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> And for what it&#8217;s worth if you&#8217;re interested Wally &#8211; I can get none of your examples to work under MD2.8a and 4.101
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I am sure it is something simple or idiotic I am doing but Please can anyone help
</I>&gt;<i> And yes &#8211; it is late I have worked 12 hours today and I am massively cheesed off.- L
</I>&gt;<i> John Murray
</I>&gt;<i> PS
</I>&gt;<i> And just to add insult to injury I&#8217;ve discovered that xcode 4.3 does away with interface builder &#8211; a whole  new learning curve
