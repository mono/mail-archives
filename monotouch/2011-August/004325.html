<PRE>I did figure a solution, my event handler to update views was on the
deceleration end of the scroll. It never gets called on the first event
of a double-scroll, because it doesn't decelerate. My solution is to
look at the difference, and when bigger than 1 page, to manually add the
missing view,

 

Thanks,

Jon

My *guess* would be that perhaps the GC thread is getting in the way
here, trying hard to clean up all the removed objects.

 

A common trick to work around this problem is to try and re-use your
heavier objects used in this scenario to try and limit the amount of
work the GC has to do. How hard this is to do depends on how your code
works/was designed etc.

 

It's possible that the SGen GC would be more performant in this case
(MonoTouch still uses the Boehm GC), but until we get SGen ported to
MonoTouch and work out any kinks it may have we'll never know :-(

 

I hope you figure out a solution,

 

Jeff

My Magazine App runs fine in the simulator, and ok in normal use on the
Ipad, but when you scroll too

Fast, it leaves blank pages which all my optimisations cannot seem to
fix. The code seems to work fine,

But just not performant. It uses dynamic adding and removing of views on
a UIScrollView.
