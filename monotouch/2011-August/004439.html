<PRE>Further to Jason Awbreys response (sorry if I'm doubling up here but I am
having difficulty seeing any of my posts except the first in Ximian lists
and certainly can t see any responses unless they're directed exactly to me
= weird

 

Anyway Jason suggested declaring  my people picker at class level rather
than just a var in the code

 

-          Presume he means making it a public defined object 

Tried this doesn't work though haven't tried any subclassing - fail to see
why I should need to 

The whole damn thing was working fine last night before I upgraded 

 

Also for what its worth I've got loads of example code from Waaly McClure's
book (and altera)  - this simply wil not run in MD2.8 with touch 4

Yes of course you get invited to upgrade the project, create a back up even
convert it to VS2010 style project

 

Then they (yes I've tried three or four) compile and complain that SDK level
is too low - - altered that in project options 

Then compiles ok 

But gives a SIGSEGV error 

 

Grateful for any suggestions - am currently downloading xcode 4_0_2 and sdk
4.3  (I don't have Lion)  to see if that makes any difference 

 

Just so annoying that it could stop functioning overnight
