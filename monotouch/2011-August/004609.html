<PRE>Hi Pierce,

&gt;<i> Hi, I am very new to MonoTouch and recently read the book Professional
</I>&gt;<i> iPhone
</I>&gt;<i> Programming with MonoTouch and .NET/C#. However, I have had some trouble
</I>&gt;<i> understanding exactly how the UI as a whole works (I'm also new to mobile
</I>&gt;<i> development).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If someone could Skype/communicate via email with me, that would be great.
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise, I have listed most of my questions below.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Can a view be functional without a controller?
</I>&gt;<i> 2. If you were to have a tab and navigation controller interacting with
</I>&gt;<i> each
</I>&gt;<i> other, would you place this on a ViewController and use that to push views
</I>&gt;<i> or control what's happening? Or would you need a controller for each
</I>&gt;<i> individual thing?
</I>&gt;<i> 3. The book mentioned several web-based services for storing data. However,
</I>&gt;<i> if I wanted to store it in a MySQL database, would I just need to import
</I>&gt;<i> some ADO.NET classes in order to gain this functionality?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You could import the SQLite binding (or the fully managed SQLite
implementation). You probably wouldn't want to import all of ADO.NET.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From more of a product question: Does the student version of MonoTouch
</I>&gt;<i> feature deployment as well? Because $399 is VERY expensive for a college
</I>&gt;<i> student who wants to start development.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If you are a student, you should definitely send an email off to
<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monotouch">support at xamarin.com</A> and inquire about a student license as I'm fairly sure
we have a cheaper solution for students ;-)
