<PRE>Your assumption is both correct and incorrect.  The monotouch framework,
those parts that are truly .net compatible, are indeed cross platform.  My
current IOS project utilizes a network layer that I wrote and tested
entirely on PCs using Visual Studio 2010.

The trick (imho) in cross platform development is learning enough about the
framework to know what is and isn't &quot;standard&quot; .net functionality and then
structuring your codebase accordingly.  Separating functionality into
separate projects (dll's, or just separate projects that are
inter-associated) helps.

Can someone create a single codebase for entire applications that simply run
on all three platforms you mentioned - answer NO.  Can you write a certain
percentage to be cross platform - answer YES.  Of particular problem is the
UI.  The IOS MVC is *not* win forms, etc...  so separating interface from
underlying functionality does at least give you some cross-platform
re-usability.

In my eyes there are three advantages to using MT.  1. A certain percentage
of the applicaiton is cross-platform if the project(s) are architected
correctly.  2. You won't have to learn Objective C, which is the language of
the 7th level of hell.  3. Your &quot;coming up to speed&quot; time is spent on
learning the platform-specific bits, rather than rewriting the portable
portions over and over in different languages.
