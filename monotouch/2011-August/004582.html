Hello Jitendra
Thanks for your interest in Xamarin.

MonoTouch is licensed to a single owner for one developer.  We do not count applications, so you can deploy as many applications as you would like, including multiple applications to the same device.  If you purchase MonoTouch Professional, you can deploy directly to up to 100 devices using Ad-hoc deployment and you can deploy your applications to the app store.  If you purchase MonoTouch Enterprise, not only can you use ad-hoc deployment and app store deployment, you can also use Apple's In-House deployment model, which they offer to members of their Enterprise Developer program:

Hope that helps.  Please let us know if you have any additional questions.

Thank you
Joseph

Hi Support team,

Please give me brief details for below questions.

Question1 - Please give the details regarding total number applications, we can deploy as we buy professional ($399) Monotouch licensed for IOS system?

Question2 - Can we deploy multiple versions of same application into a physical device, does it consider each version number as one application or all versions are considered as one application?



Thanks &amp; Regards,
