<PRE>Hey Demis,

I took your advice and went the WCF path&#8230; seems a much better way to do things.

I still have a problem though&#8230;

I created a VERY simple service at <A HREF="http://hotdogs.infocore.com.au/hotdogs/Service1.svc,">http://hotdogs.infocore.com.au/hotdogs/Service1.svc,</A> it works fine in VS 2010 but doesn&#8217;t work in MT, I have just exhausted my limited knowledge on trying to figure it out, with no success&#8230;

I added it as a WCF web reference called hdService and then have the following:

hdService.ServiceClient client = new hdService.ServiceClient();
Console.Writeline(client.Greeting&#8221;Dean&#8221;));

But it doesn&#8217;t run, keeps stopping with &#8220;Object reference not set to an instance of an object&#8221; also referencing the System.ServiceModel.ChannelFactory, whatever that is &#9786;

I don&#8217;t know if it me, MT, the service or what&#8230;

I&#8217;ll leave the service running, can someone try and consume it and tell me if it works? Or tell me what I am missing / doing wrong?

Thanks!
Dean

Hey Dean,

Apart from the technical limitations, coupling your web services with your RDBMS is generally considered bad practice. (Although I'd also argue that due to its inefficiency, using SOAP in your resource constrained MonoTouch app should also be avoided).

Why don't you just go the normal route and wrap your DB logic inside a standard .asmx web service? though my preference would be to avoid SOAP entirely and just use one of the many REST service frameworks available in .NET.

If performance ever becomes a problem you can also try using my <A HREF="http://servicestack.net">http://servicestack.net</A> web service framework, where the JSON and JSV endpoints are multiple times more efficient than SOAP web services.

Ok so I found my problem is a bug (<A HREF="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=670956">https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=670956</A>)

So I changed the  SqlXml class of the Reference.cs file to read, as the poster mentioned at the bottom of the bug report:

   public partial class SqlXml {
        [System.Xml.Serialization.XmlAnyElement(Namespace=&quot;Any&quot;)]
        [System.Xml.Serialization.XmlAnyElement(Name=&quot;Any&quot;)]
        [System.Xml.Serialization.XmlTextAttribute()]
        public System.Xml.XmlNode Any;
    }
But that still doesn&#8217;t work&#8230; has anyone been able to get this to work?  I&#8217;m getting desperate&#8230;

Cheers,
Dean

Subject: [MonoTouch] Web Services

Hi All,

I am having a web service problem I can&#8217;t figure out&#8230;

I have a web service on my MSSQL server with a web method on it&#8230;

The following works fine in VS.NET&lt;<A HREF="http://VS.NET">http://VS.NET</A>&gt; but doesn&#8217;t work in Mono, now I am using 2.8a but I wouldn&#8217;t have thought that anything would have changed in the web services side&#8230;

The code is:

GetMeets service = new GetMeets();
Service.Credentials = new NetworkCredentials(&#8220;username&#8221;,&#8221;password&#8221;);

It fails on the first line with:

&#8220;There was an error reflecting type &#8216;&#8230;..SqlXml&#8217;. Looking at the InnerException is shows &#8220;There was an error reflecting field &#8216;Any&#8217;&#8230;. The elemeny Any has been attributed with an XmlAnyElementAttribute and a namespace, but no name.

Has anyone come across this before?

Cheers,
Dean
