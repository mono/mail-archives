<PRE>Hi, I am very new to MonoTouch and recently read the book Professional iPhone
Programming with MonoTouch and .NET/C#. However, I have had some trouble
understanding exactly how the UI as a whole works (I'm also new to mobile
development). 

If someone could Skype/communicate via email with me, that would be great.
Otherwise, I have listed most of my questions below.

1. Can a view be functional without a controller?
2. If you were to have a tab and navigation controller interacting with each
other, would you place this on a ViewController and use that to push views
or control what's happening? Or would you need a controller for each
individual thing?
3. The book mentioned several web-based services for storing data. However,
if I wanted to store it in a MySQL database, would I just need to import
some ADO.NET classes in order to gain this functionality?

&gt;<i>From more of a product question: Does the student version of MonoTouch
</I>feature deployment as well? Because $399 is VERY expensive for a college
student who wants to start development.

I appreciate the help guys, it really means a lot (I love a sense of
community among like-minded developers).
