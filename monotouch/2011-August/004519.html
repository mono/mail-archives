<PRE>
Like everyone else I'm venturing into mobile app-development coming from a
background of developing for the desktop and the web.

I have a client who needs location aware notifications in an iOS app.
I'm trying to settle on a framework for this app, my first real mobile
project, and monotouch seems like a nice fit.

A user story goes like this: The user is out walking the town. She's got
her iPhone in her pocket and is listening to music via iTunes. As she
walks into her local mall my app (running in the background) detects
that she is in the proximity of a branch of her bank. My app also knows
that the user has some errand to do at the bank. So my app interrupts
the currently playing iTunes track, plays a notification sound and puts
a notification text on the screen, telling the user that there's a bank
office nearby and that she might want to do that bank errand now.

Could this be done with monotouch?

thanks in advance, Oivvio
