<PRE>Absolutely, yes.

you have 2 options for this:

1. you can write a satnav-like solution, similar to TomTom or MapMyRun
or Runkeeper. These stay running in the background and get location
updates as the user moves. The downside is, this chews the battery, so
it's not something the user  might want to have on all the time. I
think there might even be API's for &quot;when you enter this area, do X&quot;

2. you could use significant location change API's. This means you get
called when the user has moved a significant amount - usually between
cell sites. Basically, your app is put to sleep, and woken up when the
change happens. However, apple's version of &quot;significant&quot; is different
to mine. I wanted (for eg) every 100m or even 500m. I ended up getting
2 change events in a 20 min bus ride in London. Thats not enough, even
at slow London traffic speeds :)

Personally, I'd love to have a combination: I want the very accurate
location (which #1 is), but only wake up and tell me every (eg) 5
mins. That would be perfect. But I dont think you can do that.



So yes, what you describe can be done, and of course can be done in
MonoTouch (a usual rule of thumb is: if you can do it Obj-C, you can
do it in MonoTouch, at least with respect to CocoaTouch API's)

The apple docs are good on location change stuff, and I got a copy of
this: <A HREF="http://www.amazon.co.uk/IPhone-Application-Development-IOS-QuickStart/dp/0321719689">http://www.amazon.co.uk/IPhone-Application-Development-IOS-QuickStart/dp/0321719689</A>
which has a good section on location-based stuff.

Now, would apple accept this into the appstore? I'm not sure.....
thats a question for Apple :)
