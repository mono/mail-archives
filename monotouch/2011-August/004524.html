Thanks. I think #2 will not cut it for the client's needs. Is there
anything one can do to mitigate the battery drainage of #1? Like using
cell tower/wifi for location instead of GPS? (This app will only be used
in urban settings anyway.) And maybe increasing the polling interval? I
don't need the precision of something like Runkeeper.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So yes, what you describe can be done, and of course can be done in
</I>&gt;<i> MonoTouch (a usual rule of thumb is: if you can do it Obj-C, you can
</I>&gt;<i> do it in MonoTouch, at least with respect to CocoaTouch API's)
</I>
That's also good to know.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The apple docs are good on location change stuff, and I got a copy of
</I>&gt;<i> this: <A HREF="http://www.amazon.co.uk/IPhone-Application-Development-IOS-QuickStart/dp/0321719689">http://www.amazon.co.uk/IPhone-Application-Development-IOS-QuickStart/dp/0321719689</A>
</I>&gt;<i> which has a good section on location-based stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, would apple accept this into the appstore? I'm not sure.....
</I>&gt;<i> thats a question for Apple :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Anything in particular with this concept that you think would make them
disapprove?
