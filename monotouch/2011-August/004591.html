<PRE>Hi Dean,

From last report it looks like Mono team will only be supporting and implementing the &quot;Silverlight Subset&quot; of WCF so you'll have to wait till you hear back from them to figure out if what you're trying to do falls within that subset.

Although I'm the maintainer of WCF replacement web services stack called <A HREF="http://www.servicestack.net">http://www.servicestack.net</A> which I currently support on Mono and now recently on MonoTouch. Since it's open source and I'm able to control the entire source code, it's much easier for me to support and add functionality.

It's both an RPC/SOAP and REST convention-based web services framework that is configuration-free so is easy to setup. If you're interested I have a preconfigured MonoTouch client application that uses it available here:

<A HREF="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Examples/tree/master/src/MonoTouch/RestFilesClient">https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Examples/tree/master/src/MonoTouch/RestFilesClient</A>

The project includes all the dependencies you need and has examples of both sync and async clients (both with 1 LOC):

//calling sync web service
var response = gateway.Get&lt;FilesResponse&gt;(txtPath.Text);

//calling async web service
gateway.GetAsync&lt;FilesResponse&gt;(txtPath.Text, 
	r =&gt; InvokeOnMainThread(() =&gt; txtResults.Text = r.Dump()), 
	null);

There's no code-gen as the same DTO classes you use to define your web services on the server can be used as-is in your client application to provide a strongly-typed client with an easy and friction-free development workflow.
As a bonus it uses my fast Json Serializer which the latest benchmarks places it a multitude of times faster than any serializer shipping with .NET.

If you don't mind binary protocols, protobuf-net remains the fastest serializer for .NET and also includes an RPC-based framework. Having spoken with the author, one of his goals was to support MonoTouch although I'm not sure what the current status on MonoTouch is at the moment.

Anyway if you decide to try servicetack.net feel free to post any questions/issues you have to the group:
<A HREF="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/servicestack">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/servicestack</A>

Cheers,
Demis

</I>&gt;<i> Hey Dean,
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Apart from the technical limitations, coupling your web services with your RDBMS is generally considered bad practice. (Although I'd also argue that due to its inefficiency, using SOAP in your resource constrained MonoTouch app should also be avoided).
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Why don't you just go the normal route and wrap your DB logic inside a standard .asmx web service? though my preference would be to avoid SOAP entirely and just use one of the many REST service frameworks available in .NET.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> If performance ever becomes a problem you can also try using my <A HREF="http://servicestack.net">http://servicestack.net</A> web service framework, where the JSON and JSV endpoints are multiple times more efficient than SOAP web services.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi All,
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I am having a web service problem I can&#8217;t figure out&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I have a web service on my MSSQL server with a web method on it&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> The following works fine in VS.NET but doesn&#8217;t work in Mono, now I am using 2.8a but I wouldn&#8217;t have thought that anything would have changed in the web services side&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> The code is:
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> GetMeets service = new GetMeets();
</I>&gt;<i> Service.Credentials = new NetworkCredentials(&#8220;username&#8221;,&#8221;password&#8221;);
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> It fails on the first line with:
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;There was an error reflecting type &#8216;&#8230;..SqlXml&#8217;. Looking at the InnerException is shows &#8220;There was an error reflecting field &#8216;Any&#8217;&#8230;. The elemeny Any has been attributed with an XmlAnyElementAttribute and a namespace, but no name.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Has anyone come across this before?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Dean
