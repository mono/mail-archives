<PRE>To clarify:

The selector is akin to a method signature.

ObjC can't find a method with that signature.

When I have had this problem in the past (not in the WillEnterForeground
override), it has been a memory reference problem.

Regards,

James

Can you paste your AppDelegate?

The iOS object which is being sent the selector might not be the same
object reference the method is expecting.

BTW You can profile to look for problems:

   And that&#8217;s exactly my point. The code I have shared does nothing, yet
the exception handler in my Main() function traps errors like this, and
then the app crashes completely:



MonoTouch.Foundation.MonoTouchException: Objective-C exception thrown.
Name: NSInvalidArgumentException Reason: -[OS_dispatch_semaphore
UIApplicationWillEnterForeground:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance

I am confused by this:



Reason: -[OS_dispatch_semaphore UIApplicationWillEnterForeground:]:
unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x81b27e0



When my code does nothing in the WillEnterForeground call. So what is
passing an unrecognized selector in that call if it&#8217;s not my code? Can you
see now why I&#8217;m rather stressed about this?



Code somewhere else? I have about 90 to 100 view controllers, plus their
respective DataSource classes. Starting to look at that with the view that
&#8220;something might be wrong somewhere&#8221; is not an enthralling task. I don&#8217;t
have a single thing to go on &#8211; not even a hint as to what class, nothing.
It&#8217;s like looking for a needle in a haystack.

My point is that the code you have shared does nothing, hence I would be
surprised if it is that code which causes the problem.



The try block is empty. Therefore it can't be that catch block catching the
exception.



Is it possible that some code elsewhere is not disposing of a reference?

James

 James,



I did share the code. That&#8217;s it:



public override void WillEnterForeground(UIApplication application)

{

                    try

                    {


//ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(this.EnterForeground);

                    }

                    catch (Exception ex)

                    {

                                         Application.SendError(ex);

                    }

}



I can&#8217;t publish my entire app code in here. But why am I getting exceptions
that simply crash my app in a method that I have no real code in? Even if I
comment out the entire &#8220;WillEnterForeground&#8221; I still get explosions that
just kill the app completely.



It will not break in code &#8211; always just blows up. Never blew up before,
just after I made the mistake of upgrading to MonoTouch 6.0.3. This code
has been working for over 12 months, and now I&#8217;m in deep shit where I can&#8217;t
publish a new version because I cannot get any help on some severe crashes.



Hell &#8211; I&#8217;ve even got one crash on an iPad where it actually manages to
disable the Home button until you reboot the device &#8211; any ideas what API I
might be using incorrectly to achieve that?

To be blunt, we can't help without having code to look through.



MonoTouch doesn't just add method calls, and throw exceptions on its own.



My guess is that your problem is probably an incorrect use of an API or
object somewhere.



iOS application development is a lot more accessible now, thanks to MT, but
if you don't do the basics, just as with ObjC or PhoneGap (et. al.) your
foundations will be shaky.



Share the code, or at least somewhere we can reproduce the problem, and we
can help you diagnose the problem.

Regards,



James

 Anyone able to help before I ditch MonoTouch and try something that works?
We are seriously in a position where we cannot release code because of this
problem, and the CEO is discussing ditching MonoTouch completely because we
can&#8217;t rely on it to work.

It&#8217;s now seemingly not Linea &#8211; just random:



MonoTouch.Foundation.MonoTouchException: Objective-C exception thrown.
Name: NSInvalidArgumentException Reason: -[OS_dispatch_semaphore
UIApplicationWillEnterForeground:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance
0x81b27e0
at (wrapper managed-to-native)

args) [0x00048] in
/xsl-home/kleverlogic/FlashValet/Mobile/iPhone/Valet/Main.cs:40



And here&#8217;s my WillEnterForeground:



public override void WillEnterForeground(UIApplication application)

{

                    try

                    {


//ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(this.EnterForeground);

                    }

                    catch (Exception ex)

                    {

                                         Application.SendError(ex);

                    }

}



Yeah &#8211; basically empty, yet it still crashes in the
UIApplicationWillEnterForeground &#8211; any ideas?

I got this error report recently:



MonoTouch.Foundation.MonoTouchException: Objective-C exception thrown.
Name: NSInvalidArgumentException Reason: -[Linea
UIApplicationDidEnterBackground:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance
0x21a2a80
at MonoTouch.UIKit.UIApplication.Main (System.String[] args, System.String
principalClassName, System.String delegateClassName) [0x0004c] in
/Developer/MonoTouch/Source/monotouch/src/UIKit/UIApplication.cs:38

args) [0x00027] in
/xsl-home/kleverlogic/FlashValet/Mobile/iPhone/Valet/Main.cs:40



I&#8217;m intrigued by the &#8220;Reason: -[Linea UIApplicationDidEnterBackground:]&#8221;
because I make no calls to the linea in this, so wondered if there was even
anything I could do?
