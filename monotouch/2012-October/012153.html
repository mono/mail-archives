<PRE>Just ran into the same issue.  The codesign was a nice hint, as it certainly
failed.  I created a new solution, also tried naming the solution and
project the same as the app.  Not sure if that was part of the reason for
success either.  Interestingly enough, in the previous project the zipped up
app bundle was almost 10mb, in the new solution, it was 2.7mb.  I'm not sure
why the difference, maybe I add some additional references that were not
being signed properly and not needed in the project.  Either way, after
building the new solution, I tested it in simulator, then on device then
selected AppStore build profile, selected &quot;zip app bundle&quot;, extracted the
.app from the zip and the codesign command line from previous in this thread
suggestion worked.  Then tried submission with AppLoader and it worked.   

????  This whole appstore submission process seems way over complicated. 
One other note of possible interest is the zip bundle I pushed, had a
different name than just my app but still worked.  I didn't catch it at
first, but if appName was &quot;coolapp&quot;, the uploaded bundle was
&quot;coolapp-30.zip&quot;. It appended the version number.

fwiw
