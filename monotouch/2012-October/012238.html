<PRE>Hi there,

So like I guess anybody else here, I caught my first &quot;Attempting to JIT
compile method&quot; exception.
I've read a LOT about it, but still I can't understand how to fix mine...

I'm using Mono.UPNP for an iPad project, works flawlessly on the simulator,
was thrilled about it, but then, when I finally got ti try it on the
device...how disappointed :(

Anyway, I'm asking here for somebody to point me out the possible solution,
and maybe try to explain how he came to get the fix : I mean, I understand
it is about the AOT not being able to predicate something so cannot AOT the
call, so when I call it, it tries to compile it JIT and that's not allowed
by the Apple OS.
Ok, and this has something to do with generics, that's why the AOT cannot
predicate.
Ok, so I have to chase wich generic method, and try to &quot;dummy instantiate&quot;
to give a hint for the AOT compiler right ?
But which call really is posing problem, how can I &quot;dummy instantiate&quot; ?

Here is the call :


inside call maybe :


And full exception :


Is that enough? If you need some more code...
is that &quot;fixable&quot;?
Should I just forget about trying to use Mono.UPNP ?

Thanks a lot for those who read all of that :)
