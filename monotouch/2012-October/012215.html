<PRE>And that's exactly my point. The code I have shared does nothing, yet the exception handler in my Main() function traps errors like this, and then the app crashes completely:

MonoTouch.Foundation.MonoTouchException: Objective-C exception thrown. Name: NSInvalidArgumentException Reason: -[OS_dispatch_semaphore UIApplicationWillEnterForeground:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x81b27e0
at (wrapper managed-to-native) MonoTouch.UIKit.UIApplication:UIApplicationMain (int,string[],intptr,intptr)
at MonoTouch.UIKit.UIApplication.Main (System.String[] args, System.String principalClassName, System.String delegateClassName) [0x0004c] in /Developer/MonoTouch/Source/monotouch/src/UIKit/UIApplication.cs:38
at KleverLogic.FlashValet.iPhone.Valet.Application.Main (System.String[] args) [0x00048] in /xsl-home/kleverlogic/FlashValet/Mobile/iPhone/Valet/Main.cs:40

I am confused by this:

Reason: -[OS_dispatch_semaphore UIApplicationWillEnterForeground:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x81b27e0

When my code does nothing in the WillEnterForeground call. So what is passing an unrecognized selector in that call if it's not my code? Can you see now why I'm rather stressed about this?

Code somewhere else? I have about 90 to 100 view controllers, plus their respective DataSource classes. Starting to look at that with the view that &quot;something might be wrong somewhere&quot; is not an enthralling task. I don't have a single thing to go on - not even a hint as to what class, nothing. It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

My point is that the code you have shared does nothing, hence I would be surprised if it is that code which causes the problem.

The try block is empty. Therefore it can't be that catch block catching the exception.

Is it possible that some code elsewhere is not disposing of a reference?

James

James,

I did share the code. That's it:


public override void WillEnterForeground(UIApplication application)

{

                    try

                    {

                                         //ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(this.EnterForeground);

                    }

                    catch (Exception ex)

                    {

                                         Application.SendError(ex);

                    }

}

I can't publish my entire app code in here. But why am I getting exceptions that simply crash my app in a method that I have no real code in? Even if I comment out the entire &quot;WillEnterForeground&quot; I still get explosions that just kill the app completely.

It will not break in code - always just blows up. Never blew up before, just after I made the mistake of upgrading to MonoTouch 6.0.3. This code has been working for over 12 months, and now I'm in deep shit where I can't publish a new version because I cannot get any help on some severe crashes.

Hell - I've even got one crash on an iPad where it actually manages to disable the Home button until you reboot the device - any ideas what API I might be using incorrectly to achieve that?

To be blunt, we can't help without having code to look through.

MonoTouch doesn't just add method calls, and throw exceptions on its own.

My guess is that your problem is probably an incorrect use of an API or object somewhere.

iOS application development is a lot more accessible now, thanks to MT, but if you don't do the basics, just as with ObjC or PhoneGap (et. al.) your foundations will be shaky.

Share the code, or at least somewhere we can reproduce the problem, and we can help you diagnose the problem.

James

Anyone able to help before I ditch MonoTouch and try something that works? We are seriously in a position where we cannot release code because of this problem, and the CEO is discussing ditching MonoTouch completely because we can't rely on it to work.

Subject: RE: Any idea what this could be?

It's now seemingly not Linea - just random:

MonoTouch.Foundation.MonoTouchException: Objective-C exception thrown. Name: NSInvalidArgumentException Reason: -[OS_dispatch_semaphore UIApplicationWillEnterForeground:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x81b27e0
at (wrapper managed-to-native) MonoTouch.UIKit.UIApplication:UIApplicationMain (int,string[],intptr,intptr)
at MonoTouch.UIKit.UIApplication.Main (System.String[] args, System.String principalClassName, System.String delegateClassName) [0x0004c] in /Developer/MonoTouch/Source/monotouch/src/UIKit/UIApplication.cs:38
at KleverLogic.FlashValet.iPhone.Valet.Application.Main (System.String[] args) [0x00048] in /xsl-home/kleverlogic/FlashValet/Mobile/iPhone/Valet/Main.cs:40

And here's my WillEnterForeground:


public override void WillEnterForeground(UIApplication application)

{

                    try

                    {

                                         //ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(this.EnterForeground);

                    }

                    catch (Exception ex)

                    {

                                         Application.SendError(ex);

                    }

}

Yeah - basically empty, yet it still crashes in the UIApplicationWillEnterForeground - any ideas?

Subject: [MonoTouch] Any idea what this could be?

I got this error report recently:

MonoTouch.Foundation.MonoTouchException: Objective-C exception thrown. Name: NSInvalidArgumentException Reason: -[Linea UIApplicationDidEnterBackground:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x21a2a80
at MonoTouch.UIKit.UIApplication.Main (System.String[] args, System.String principalClassName, System.String delegateClassName) [0x0004c] in /Developer/MonoTouch/Source/monotouch/src/UIKit/UIApplication.cs:38
at KleverLogic.FlashValet.iPhone.Valet.Application.Main (System.String[] args) [0x00027] in /xsl-home/kleverlogic/FlashValet/Mobile/iPhone/Valet/Main.cs:40

I'm intrigued by the &quot;Reason: -[Linea UIApplicationDidEnterBackground:]&quot; because I make no calls to the linea in this, so wondered if there was even anything I could do?
