<PRE>If only it were that simple&#8230; connecting it to the debugger got it to crash at exactly the same &#8220;place&#8221; as where the exception report came from &#8211; it did not crash anywhere in my code even with Debug\Exceptions set to stop on every single exception. It just starts at the catch block in the Main function.

If it can be reproduced, then finding the problem shouldn&#8217;t be that hard get your CEOs devices and connect them to your mac and run the app in debug mode and make it crash. Then look at the stacktrace and you are likely to see where it is originating from. If not put a lot of debug messages in the code to try and find the problem that way.

If your CEO can make it crash but you can&#8217;t he is probably doing something you aren&#8217;t or in a different order.

In short you need to get your CEOs devices and start to debug for real.

Richard.

Subject: Re: [MonoTouch] Any idea what this could be?

It seems to be easily reproducible on given devices and iOSs &#8211; but not always. iOS6 seems fine on all 3 devices (4S, 4 and iPod Touch) I have here, but it crashes on my CEOs iPad 2 with iOS6 and his 4S with iOS5. I need to grab them off him to see if I can find a pattern, but he seems to get consistent crashes regardless.

I could do a diff, but there&#8217;s been so many check-ins in the past week, and the project is about 200 files, so to check each one, see what&#8217;s changed etc could be a mammoth task. Nothing had changed in the area I&#8217;m seeing problems in though &#8211; that I already checked.
