<PRE>All I can say is wow, thank you guys! What a response and 2 people can see
the crash! This is fantastic!

Its not an iOS6 issue, Ive had reports from iOS5 as well. Also from iPhone
4, 5, and iPads as well. Its something different about the calendar setup *I
think*.

Its something in my code that is looking at elements within a root element,
its expecting something to be there but it isn't, I just cant figure out why
it isn't. I suspect its something to do with the default calendar on the
device.

I'll send out testflight invites to the crashes shortly.

Many MANY thanks for your help on this! Very much appreciated.

Cheers
John
