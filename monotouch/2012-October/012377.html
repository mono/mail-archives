<PRE>Hey Rolf,

 

Okay, I enabled reference counting as you showed and examined an object that
I'm 100% sure should have been released:  <A HREF="http://i.imgur.com/qdj4v.png">http://i.imgur.com/qdj4v.png</A>

 

I see monotouch_retain_trampoline doing 4 retains and 2 releases.  Here's
the full stacktraces from all events: <A HREF="http://pastebin.com/jmYzQWHn">http://pastebin.com/jmYzQWHn</A>

 

The first two retains have identical stack traces.  I can tell from the
stack trace that these are both happening when I insert the UIView into the
visual tree (I'm just passing it to InsertSubview)

 

The third and fourth retains are getting released immediately after they're
taken with an almost identical stack trace.  So I believe the big question
is: why aren't the first two retains getting released?

 

I'm gathering that MonoTouch calls retain when a view is added to the visual
tree (twice?).  Under normal operation, when would the corresponding
releases get called, and do you have any idea why this might not be
happening here?

 

Thanks again!

Hey Rolf,

 

Thanks again for the reply - this is very helpful.   Yes, I am profiling on
an actual device, and no, I'm not creating any threads in this code.  I
wonder if the UITableView that's in use is creating these threads.

 

Thanks for the tip about looking at the full graph instead of the diff.  I
was thinking the diff would be most important, but I've changed my strategy.
This time I loaded my menu over and over until 80%+ of the app's memory is
filled with leaked objects, that way I can look at the full dump instead of
the diff and still be mostly looking at leaked objects.

Am I correct in assuming that the correct way to use the mono profiler is to
expand the trees out to the bottom, and once you reach something that
doesn't expand, that tells you what's preventing the GC from collecting
everything above it?

 

When I do this, ultimately all of these strings expand down to one of my
UIView subclasses and then an &lt;Other Root&gt; below it - I expanded every node
to be sure. 

 

&lt;Other Root&gt; generally means a GCHandle - which is usually because
ObjectiveC has retained the object (remember that ObjectiveC is reference
counted! Whenever ObjectiveC has retained the object MonoTouch will use a
GCHandle to make sure the object isn't freed by the GC while ObjectiveC can
still access it).

 

In your screenshot I can see two types kept alive this way,
WAML.Controls.ContainerControl.TouchableView and
WAML.Controls.Drawable.DrawableView.

 

I would go back to Instruments, and do a memory profile (enable reference
count tracking) and see what references these objects. Here is a short video
showing how to do it: <A HREF="http://screencast.com/t/ftC12Wu9">http://screencast.com/t/ftC12Wu9</A>

 

Note that MonoTouch will retain the objects too, so you should ignore the
retain MonoTouch does (the GCHandle keeping these objects alive will be
removed once the retainCount drops to 1 - so you should look for anything
that keep the retainCount &gt; 1).

 

Rolf

 

 

What does &lt;Other Root&gt; mean in this context?  Could this mean that something
is keeping a reference around to my UIViews even after everything that used
them has been popped from the navigation controller?  Is there any way to
see what this is or debug this further?

 

I forgot to mention my MonoTouch version: 6.0.4.  I have the SGen box
checked, but not the reference counting extension box (though I see the same
behavior in all three configurations).

 

Thanks!

Hey Rolf,

 

Thanks for the reply!  I've gotten more familiar with Instruments now, and
I've started taking several heapshots as you advised.  When looking at the
1000+ objects that are making up the 100kb+ memory leak, it  essentially
just looks like everything my app is allocating.

 

So I believe the real question I need to answer is &quot;Why isn't Mono
collecting these?&quot;  This is where I turn to the mono profiler and get really
confused.  It hardly shows anything, and most of what it does show isn't my
code (it's all System.* and MonoTouch.* types).   This is the view with
Inversed References: <A HREF="http://i.imgur.com/Z0MuD.png">http://i.imgur.com/Z0MuD.png</A>

 

If my goal is to figure out why the Mono GC isn't collecting something, I
assume Instruments won't tell me that, correct?  Will the mono profiler tell
me that?  Is there any other way to find out?

 

If you're not doing it, you should be profiling on device - device builds
have been optimized for execution speed and lower memory consumption, while
simulator builds have been optimized for fast project builds (this is so you
can quicker debug your app after making a change).

 

You're right about Instruments, it will not tell you why Mono's GC isn't
freeing a managed object, that's where the Mono Profiler will help you.

 

&gt;<i>From your screenshot I find a couple of things:
</I>
 

* Are you creating threads for every heapshot iteration? The string
instances you've expanded are references by a System.Threading.Thread object
through its Current[UI]Culture - and those will stay alive as long as the
thread stays alive (and the Thread objects show up at the bottom too).

* Many objects can't be expanded in your screenshot - this is because their
parent isn't included in the diff between the two heapshots. You might want
to untick the 3 after figuring out which type you're interested in to see
the full tree of objects referencing it.

* In general most objects will be framework types (System.* or MonoTouch.*)
- but you will usually find your own objects at the top of the tree keeping
all those framework objects alive (there are a few exceptions of course,
such as the Thread object, which is automatically kept alive until the
corresponding thread exits without you actually having to keep a reference
to it).

Hi,

I believe my MonoTouch app is leaking memory, and I've been struggling at
figuring out why.

 

By using Instruments I can see the allocated memory grow and grow over the
life of the app, eventually causing the app to die after 10 minutes or so of
general use on my 3GS.

 

To help isolate the problem, I first picked a specific action in my app I
can easily repeat - just opening a menu and closing it again, which
shouldn't leave any garbage behind as the code is well-contained. Using
Instruments, I can see that just opening and closing this menu adds about
90KB of allocations each time.  If I open and close it 11 times, I've added
a megabyte to my app's memory use.

 

I first tried enabling SGen and then the reference counting extension.
Neither configuration changed the memory allocated.

 

I tried commenting out parts of the menu that I thought might be leaking
(images, custom-draw views, etc.).  Doing this did reduce the memory
leakage, but even if I comment out all of the functionality (to the point
where my menu came up blank) it was still leaking 40KB each time. So I still
feel I'm missing something fundamental.

 

I was concerned that the garbage collector might just not be running,
flawing my test results.  I added a call to GC.Collect() but that didn't
change anything.  I also tried doing it 50 times in a row, leaking over 4
megs of memory, to see if the GC would eventually collect it all. It never
did.

 

Throughout this, I've been trying to understand the mono memory profiler.
Following the instructions, I take a shot, open and close my app's menu, and
take another shot, then diff them, and I see this:
<A HREF="http://i.imgur.com/N4Ngb.png.">http://i.imgur.com/N4Ngb.png.</A>  Checking &quot;Roots only&quot; doesn't change anything
(the three new columns are empty). 

 

  Instruments-&gt;Leaks shows this:  <A HREF="http://i.imgur.com/hbJQ1.png">http://i.imgur.com/hbJQ1.png</A>

 

First: you should do more than 1 heapshot, do several until the heap growth
settles around a ~fixed amount, otherwise there will be some noise (iOS
caches some this heavily) in the output (this is true for the Mono profiler
too).

 

Then you can start examining the result - your screenshot shows various
objects which haven't been freed. You can see the stack trace for where each
of these objects were created by expanding it and selecting a specific
instance, then showing the extended detail view (in the toolbar, there are
three buttons above the label &quot;View&quot; - click on the right-most button).

 

 

For comparison, I also ran the profiler against my code with virtually all
of my code commented out (it was just bringing up a blank menu).  Memory
leak is about 40KB in this scenario:  <A HREF="http://i.imgur.com/eIlK7.png">http://i.imgur.com/eIlK7.png</A>

 

I'm very confused by these results. My questions are:

 

1.       What is &lt;Other Root&gt; and why does it have thousands of instances
that total 0 memory?  This appears to be the common factor in both of them.

Other Roots are usually GCHandles - you can normally just ignore these
roots, they are very rarely the cause for any problems.

 

2.       In the first one, it says 20KB of strings leaked.  How can I tell
where these are coming from or why they aren't being collected?

3.       What uses System.WeakReference and why would it be leaking?

For both 2. and 3. you should check the &quot;Inverse References&quot; checkbox, and
then expand the treeview for the objects you want to examine - this will
allow you to see what types reference the topmost type. 

 

4.       The mono profiler only seems to account for a small part of the
total memory being leaked.  Is there anything else I can try?

The mono profiler only knows about managed memory, not everything allocated
in the app (only Instruments have a global knowledge of memory in the app,
but it can be tricky to get the interesting information out of Instruments).

 

5.       What else can I do to try and figure out why my app is continually
growing in memory? 

 

I feel like I'm missing something fundamental here.  I'd appreciate any
advice anyone can offer!
