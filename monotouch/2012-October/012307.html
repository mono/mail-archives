<PRE>Hi,

Whilst I cannot give you answers I have been profiling one of my apps recently and noticed similar things going on, can you show us your code that you are using, what I did find made a difference for me was scope, because the GC was causing problems I declared almost everything at the class rather than module/event level, I am slowly moving more of my declarations back to the module/event level this has improved how well GC is working for me, I also found that specifically using dispose on my objects or using () {} has also helped, but there is still some bits hanging around but not much.

What you might find which is what I saw when profiling, was memory growing for a while and every now and again going back down, this seemed to be not when GC is being called so it , also memory never goes back to the base amount.

&gt;<i> I believe my MonoTouch app is leaking memory, and I&#8217;ve been struggling at figuring out why.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> By using Instruments I can see the allocated memory grow and grow over the life of the app, eventually causing the app to die after 10 minutes or so of general use on my 3GS.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> To help isolate the problem, I first picked a specific action in my app I can easily repeat &#8211; just opening a menu and closing it again, which shouldn&#8217;t leave any garbage behind as the code is well-contained. Using Instruments, I can see that just opening and closing this menu adds about 90KB of allocations each time.  If I open and close it 11 times, I&#8217;ve added a megabyte to my app&#8217;s memory use.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I first tried enabling SGen and then the reference counting extension.  Neither configuration changed the memory allocated.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I tried commenting out parts of the menu that I thought might be leaking (images, custom-draw views, etc.).  Doing this did reduce the memory leakage, but even if I comment out all of the functionality (to the point where my menu came up blank) it was still leaking 40KB each time. So I still feel I&#8217;m missing something fundamental.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I was concerned that the garbage collector might just not be running, flawing my test results.  I added a call to GC.Collect() but that didn&#8217;t change anything.  I also tried doing it 50 times in a row, leaking over 4 megs of memory, to see if the GC would eventually collect it all. It never did.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Throughout this, I&#8217;ve been trying to understand the mono memory profiler.  Following the instructions, I take a shot, open and close my app&#8217;s menu, and take another shot, then diff them, and I see this: <A HREF="http://i.imgur.com/N4Ngb.png.">http://i.imgur.com/N4Ngb.png.</A>  Checking &#8220;Roots only&#8221; doesn&#8217;t change anything (the three new columns are empty).   Instruments-&gt;Leaks shows this:  <A HREF="http://i.imgur.com/hbJQ1.png">http://i.imgur.com/hbJQ1.png</A>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> For comparison, I also ran the profiler against my code with virtually all of my code commented out (it was just bringing up a blank menu).  Memory leak is about 40KB in this scenario:  <A HREF="http://i.imgur.com/eIlK7.png">http://i.imgur.com/eIlK7.png</A>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;m very confused by these results. My questions are:
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 1.       What is &lt;Other Root&gt; and why does it have thousands of instances that total 0 memory?  This appears to be the common factor in both of them.
</I>&gt;<i> 2.       In the first one, it says 20KB of strings leaked.  How can I tell where these are coming from or why they aren&#8217;t being collected?
</I>&gt;<i> 3.       What uses System.WeakReference and why would it be leaking?
</I>&gt;<i> 4.       The mono profiler only seems to account for a small part of the total memory being leaked.  Is there anything else I can try?
</I>&gt;<i> 5.       What else can I do to try and figure out why my app is continually growing in memory?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I feel like I&#8217;m missing something fundamental here.  I&#8217;d appreciate any advice anyone can offer!
