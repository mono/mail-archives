<PRE>If it can be reproduced, then finding the problem shouldn&#8217;t be that hard get your CEOs devices and connect them to your mac and run the app in debug mode and make it crash. Then look at the stacktrace and you are likely to see where it is originating from. If not put a lot of debug messages in the code to try and find the problem that way. 

If your CEO can make it crash but you can&#8217;t he is probably doing something you aren&#8217;t or in a different order.

In short you need to get your CEOs devices and start to debug for real.

Richard.

Subject: Re: [MonoTouch] Any idea what this could be?

It seems to be easily reproducible on given devices and iOSs &#8211; but not always. iOS6 seems fine on all 3 devices (4S, 4 and iPod Touch) I have here, but it crashes on my CEOs iPad 2 with iOS6 and his 4S with iOS5. I need to grab them off him to see if I can find a pattern, but he seems to get consistent crashes regardless.

 

I could do a diff, but there&#8217;s been so many check-ins in the past week, and the project is about 200 files, so to check each one, see what&#8217;s changed etc could be a mammoth task. Nothing had changed in the area I&#8217;m seeing problems in though &#8211; that I already checked.

Subject: Re: [MonoTouch] Any idea what this could be?

 

Yeah, actually deploying a MT5.2-based app might not be the solution, just wondering if it resolves the issue and therefore helps narrow it down to something in MT or something in the app?

 

Another thing that I'm not sure you've mentioned is whether it is easily, reliably reproducible - or just random? If random, is it still guaranteed to happen within a certain period (ie. always happens within 5 minutes of usage) or something like that? You did say that sometimes it fails differently (ie. disables home button?) - is it always the same error message with the same 'breaking' behaviour, or was that a specific combination of code that was repeatable? since the errors are around foreground behaviour, i 

 

As you said, it feels like a needle in a haystack. When all else fails, I usually end up doing a source-control diff to my last-known-good version and undoing everything bit-by-bit. Even that is very difficult if you can't easily/reliably reproduce in the first place, cause you don't know when it's fixed :)

 

If you _can_ easily/reliably reproduce, the best bet is to gradually rip out code until you have the smallest breaking example and submit that to bugzilla for the devs to investigate. But that only works if it is reproducible to start with :-\

wish i could give some more concrete advice, but as you say it's a very vague situation to start with. 

 

cd

 

p.s. random question: I presume that WillEnterForeground code is in your AppDelegate? are you also creating NSNotificationCenter.DefaultCenter.AddObserver() listeners for UIApplication.WillEnterForegroundNotification anywhere in your app? long shot i know...

Craig,

 

I went from version 5.2.12. I didn&#8217;t know 6.0.4 was out, until I re-started MonoDevelop after installing 5.2.12 again, but I see it only changes a compiler setting for something specific.

 

Am going to recompile in 5.2.12 and see if the CEO has the same problems. If so, it probably is something I did in code, but what I have no idea. The exception reports are all extremely vague.

 

Looks like going back to 5.2.12 is not an option as I still only have SDK 6 as a choice, and it means all the orientation stuff is broken. So unless I buy another Mac with Lion on it and go back to XCode 4.4 I&#8217;m not sure how I can get around that.

from what version did you move _to_ 6.0.3? perhaps the changelog between the two releases might point at something that's been updated to give you a clue?

 

also, 6.0.4 has been released

<A HREF="http://docs.xamarin.com/ios/releases/MonoTouch_6/MonoTouch_6.0#MonoTouch_6.0.4">http://docs.xamarin.com/ios/releases/MonoTouch_6/MonoTouch_6.0#MonoTouch_6.0.4</A>

-- you might already have been prompted to download that? might be worth trying? alternatively, does downgrading back to the previous MT version you had fix the problem?

James,

 

I did share the code. That&#8217;s it:

 

public override void WillEnterForeground(UIApplication application){                    try                    {                                         //ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(this.EnterForeground);                    }                    catch (Exception ex)                    {                                         Application.SendError(ex);                    }} 

I can&#8217;t publish my entire app code in here. But why am I getting exceptions that simply crash my app in a method that I have no real code in? Even if I comment out the entire &#8220;WillEnterForeground&#8221; I still get explosions that just kill the app completely. 

 

It will not break in code &#8211; always just blows up. Never blew up before, just after I made the mistake of upgrading to MonoTouch 6.0.3. This code has been working for over 12 months, and now I&#8217;m in deep shit where I can&#8217;t publish a new version because I cannot get any help on some severe crashes.

 

Hell &#8211; I&#8217;ve even got one crash on an iPad where it actually manages to disable the Home button until you reboot the device &#8211; any ideas what API I might be using incorrectly to achieve that?

To be blunt, we can't help without having code to look through. 

 

MonoTouch doesn't just add method calls, and throw exceptions on its own. 

 

My guess is that your problem is probably an incorrect use of an API or object somewhere. 

 

iOS application development is a lot more accessible now, thanks to MT, but if you don't do the basics, just as with ObjC or PhoneGap (et. al.) your foundations will be shaky. 

 

Share the code, or at least somewhere we can reproduce the problem, and we can help you diagnose the problem. 

Regards,

 

James

  Anyone able to help before I ditch MonoTouch and try something that works? We are seriously in a position where we cannot release code because of this problem, and the CEO is discussing ditching MonoTouch completely because we can&#8217;t rely on it to work.

  It&#8217;s now seemingly not Linea &#8211; just random:

   

  MonoTouch.Foundation.MonoTouchException: Objective-C exception thrown. Name: NSInvalidArgumentException Reason: -[OS_dispatch_semaphore UIApplicationWillEnterForeground:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x81b27e0
  at (wrapper managed-to-native) MonoTouch.UIKit.UIApplication:UIApplicationMain (int,string[],intptr,intptr)
  at MonoTouch.UIKit.UIApplication.Main (System.String[] args, System.String principalClassName, System.String delegateClassName) [0x0004c] in /Developer/MonoTouch/Source/monotouch/src/UIKit/UIApplication.cs:38 
  at KleverLogic.FlashValet.iPhone.Valet.Application.Main (System.String[] args) [0x00048] in /xsl-home/kleverlogic/FlashValet/Mobile/iPhone/Valet/Main.cs:40

   

  And here&#8217;s my WillEnterForeground:

   

public override void WillEnterForeground(UIApplication application){                    try                    {                                         //ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(this.EnterForeground);                    }                    catch (Exception ex)                    {                                         Application.SendError(ex);                    }} 

  Yeah &#8211; basically empty, yet it still crashes in the UIApplicationWillEnterForeground &#8211; any ideas?

  I got this error report recently:

   

  MonoTouch.Foundation.MonoTouchException: Objective-C exception thrown. Name: NSInvalidArgumentException Reason: -[Linea UIApplicationDidEnterBackground:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x21a2a80
  at MonoTouch.UIKit.UIApplication.Main (System.String[] args, System.String principalClassName, System.String delegateClassName) [0x0004c] in /Developer/MonoTouch/Source/monotouch/src/UIKit/UIApplication.cs:38 
  at KleverLogic.FlashValet.iPhone.Valet.Application.Main (System.String[] args) [0x00027] in /xsl-home/kleverlogic/FlashValet/Mobile/iPhone/Valet/Main.cs:40

   

  I&#8217;m intrigued by the &#8220;Reason: -[Linea UIApplicationDidEnterBackground:]&#8221; because I make no calls to the linea in this, so wondered if there was even anything I could do?
