<PRE>Hi guys,
Im seeing a few crash emails from my users, all with the same crash. I can
replicate it, and none of my beta testers (all 5 of them) can replicate it
either. Ive got a new version pending in the store which doesn't fix it but
does have extra debug around it. I know from the callstack its my code
referencing something in a root element, and it can be 1 of 4 areas in my
code.

I would really appreciate it if people can download my free app and try to
add an event. The app is called myCal FREE, if people can spare a few
minutes to install it, run it, then try to add an event I would be very
grateful! My paid for version crashes in the same way too.

The crash happens when tapping the Done button. If it crashes it exists
immediately, but when you run it again it pops up with a window asking if it
can email the crash report to me. If it does crash I would appreciate it if
you would let me send you a build via TestFlight.

I would be forever in your debt, and if you try this and are ever in London
I will owe you a beer!

Thanks!
John
