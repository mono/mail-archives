<PRE>When I had the data size issue my web server was trying to send 50000 records at once.  Once I changed it to 1000 records it was all good.  If the record counts are low, maybe images are the problem?  For me it was consistent and easy to replicate.  After relooking at your errors, exception 2 and 3 looks like it was unable to connect to the server.  Maybe exception 1 was caused by corrupted data from being dropped?  In any case you should put exception handling around your web calls and either try the call again or inform the user of a bad connection.  The nature of mobile apps is that will not always be connected so you need to be able to handle these situations.

Appreciate it James, but I fear it's possibly something where you have to be actively using the app 24/7 for it to occur. This app is designed for Valet Parking providers, who issue tickets and process requests all day long - this is why I've not seen it as I just don't use the app enough to see it.

I'm also curious that some venues see more of this issue than others. Either means their data packets are larger than the rest (not the case as I have eyeballed some and they should have much less data than other venues) or their internet connection is really slow/problematic.

Dino,

Always happy to test on my devices if you need a hand.

I'm using the standard Visual Studio calls to the web client - so if I have a method called &quot;Fred&quot; I call &quot;service.Fred()&quot;.I don't use async, but I do use my own threads so there's no blocking.

I'll look into the response property, but it's a long slow fix - won't be till we publish to Apple again that I'll start to get that information, and can then look at fixing it. I can't reproduce these errors, but they're happening to a few clients in the field.

Subject: RE: Any ideas what causes this?

How are you making the web calls?  It is your choice to use async or not.  Maybe you are using a library that is forcing it to use async?  If you are there might be sync methods available.  I know RestSharp has sync and async methods.  Personally I am using async so we can use the same code on Windows Phone if we ever get that far.

The WebException has a Response property that you should be able to use to determine the Url that was called.

Subject: RE: Any ideas what causes this?

Yeah - I figured it was because of some Async calls, but I don't use the Async calls directly - so Mono? must be calling async?

And I have about 80 to 100 different web service calls - so I'm unsure which ones to page. If there was any hint as to what part of my code was causing the problem it would be useful, but I just have nothing to go on.

Subject: RE: Any ideas what causes this?

The errors are to do with making calls to the web asynchronously i.e. the error is occurring on a different thread to the code that started it, hence your namespace is not displayed.

I have experienced the first error when the data being returned was large.  My fix was to change my WCF Web API to use paging and then update my RestSharp code (in MonoTouch) to make the web calls while passing the paging parameters.  RestSharp is a library that simplifies making web calls to REST web services as it automatically serialises the data into objects.

And this one:

Likewise this one:

System.Net.WebException: The request timed out
at System.Net.HttpWebRequest.EndGetResponse (IAsyncResult asyncResult) [0x00000] in :0
at System.Net.HttpWebRequest.GetResponse () [0x00000] in :0

Once again - none of my code nor namespaces at all. How does this happen?

Subject: [MonoTouch] Any ideas what causes this?

System.Net.WebException: Error getting response stream (ReadDone2): ReceiveFailure ---&gt; System.Exception:
at System.Net.WebConnection.ReadDone(IAsyncResult result)
at System.Net.WebConnection.HandleError (WebExceptionStatus st, System.Exception e, System.String where) [0x00000] in :0

at System.Net.HttpWebRequest.GetResponse () [0x00000] in :0
at System.Web.Services.Protocols.WebClientProtocol.GetWebResponse (System.Net.WebRequest request) [0x00000] in :0

It must be being reported by this?

AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException += HandleAppDomainCurrentDomainUnhandledException;

Because none of the above is my code - there is no &quot;Xception&quot; nor &quot;KleverLogic&quot; namespace in the call. And any ideas what could cause it?
