<PRE>Hello Frank,

     Thanks for the feedback on the API, this is very useful  
information based on real world use:

&gt;<i> I have been able to use it successfully, but I wanted to mention a  
</I>&gt;<i> few small &quot;gotchas&quot; that I've run into during development. Here is  
</I>&gt;<i> my function that takes a byte array (_data) and constructs a UIImage  
</I>&gt;<i> from it:
</I>
		public CGDataProvider (byte [] buffer, int offset, int count)
&gt;<i> You'll notice that in this code I do not call Marshal.Free. That is  
</I>&gt;<i> because the image data is loaded lazily (or maybe even on-demand!),  
</I>&gt;<i> so I have to keep the buffer alive until then. (To keep things  
</I>&gt;<i> simple, I've created an IDisposable reference to that buffer. This  
</I>&gt;<i> is fine for my application, but its not pretty.) The problem is  
</I>&gt;<i> simply that the CGDataProvider is retained, but it doesn't &quot;retain&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> the HGlobal. Not sure if there is anything the library can do about  
</I>&gt;<i> this though.
</I>
I introduced a new overload that allows you to specify that the buffer  
should be owned and released by the CGDataProvider:

		public CGDataProvider (IntPtr memoryBlock, int size, bool ownBuffer)
&gt;<i> I had to cast a CGImageAlphaInfo to CGBitmapFlags. In the Apple API  
</I>&gt;<i> and docs, these are two different C enums, however CoreGraphics  
</I>&gt;<i> treats them as one set of flags. On the CGBitmapContext constructor,  
</I>&gt;<i> we have CGImageAlphaInfo whereas CGBitmapFlags has been used for the  
</I>&gt;<i> CGImage constructor. It would be nice to get this cleaned up.
</I>I added a second overload that allows the other parameter;   It will  
not come at any cost, as the linker will strip anything you do not use.

CGBitmapFlags seems richer, so I want to keep that enumeration around,  
but not break existing code.

The new drop is at:
