<PRE>

I also prefer the XIB way. There are situations I do UIs (parts of it) by code; but that is just when it becomes very dynamic.

In may last app <A HREF="http://itunes.apple.com/at/app/section-control/id343824642?mt=8">http://itunes.apple.com/at/app/section-control/id343824642?mt=8</A> (Section Control) I messed around a lot with XIB - Code generated views.

And I finally found (loading time is nothing I did care about much) that I can use XIBs without loosing much.

Finally when it comes to &quot;little changes&quot; (colors, positions, ...) it's (from my point of view) simply easier to change the things visual.

 

Also kudos about 1.4.2. The size did really change in release. Before the difference between debug / release was not really much.

With 1.4.2 I got the prommised 30% compared to the prior version.

And startup is noticeable faster - great job guis!!

 

For my &quot;Section Control&quot; that means: Old MonoTouch release build: about 13 MB (9.7 in the app store) with 1.4.2 it's 10.2 MB (I have no idea how much it would be in app store). But 2 MB means a lot - especially when it comes that close (9.7) to the 10 MB limit!

My app (the file with the exe name without an extension went down from about 9 MB to about 6 MB. mscorlib.dll went u from 438kb to 768kb. The rest stayed almost the same.

Subject: Re: [MonoTouch] XIB to code


[Usual Rory Post Summary (to compensate for my Usual Rory Logorrhea): I think the nib-or-not-to-nib discussion (at least regarding performance) has been dramatically changed for MonoTouch as of the release of 1.4.2 - in here, I'm writing about my initial impressions of performance improvements gained by simply rebuilding some apps under 1.4.2...]

I've had sooooo many conversations/debates/arguments/fights/black-eyes because of this :)


I'm anti-code-generation for UIs. At least to the extent that it's practical to avoid code-generation.


I can accept when it's done well (partial classes - such a simple idea that did away with so many problems).


But... there's more to it when it comes to the iPhone. I don't want to go into too much detail, but I've been playing around with this stuff lately.


I've ended up being pro-nib. There are some things I'm still going to do by hand, as well as things I have to do by hand, but, wherever I can, and following good design principles (principles specific to the iPhone and how it deals with nibs), I've decided that, in most cases, the performance penalty is so small that it's worth it.


Unfortunately, there are still cases where nibs would be convenient but I can't use them (more details I won't go into right now - in kind of a hurry, but can't resist responding - apologies for that).


Something that helped me decide was MonoTouch 1.4.2. I rebuilt and redeployed a couple projects (distribution builds - gotta be clear about that - not debug), and the startup times are so vastly improved that I didn't even bother formally timing them. These are nib-based apps - I haven't played with hand-coded apps yet, though I ought to - all I have to do is rebuild and redeploy the test apps I wrote a couple weeks ago (and wrote about here) to see what the differences are in those cases. If/when I do, I'll post results here.


Anyway, though I didn't code any tests, and though I didn't sit there with a timer, I did do Mississippi tests.


For the non-'Mericans reading this, one way that we, the People of the United States of 'Merica, have of trying to approximate the passing of seconds is by counting &quot;One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, three-Mississippi, four-Mississippi, etc...&quot; - it's a dirty way of becoming a human stopwatch - it's inaccurate as all get out, but you can get decent rough ideas of the passage of seconds. (&quot;Mississippi&quot;, by the way, is one of our states - I think we use it for this counting trick because the word has a rhythm to it that makes it relatively easy to say at a regular, repeatable speed.)


According to my Mississippi tests, my apps are starting up roughly 25% faster (insert a huge disclaimer here about the unreliability of the Mississippi test).


When we're talking about a few seconds, of course, 25% is significant. One of the apps is a tool I wrote for myself (another long side story). I rebuilt it under 1.4.2 just to see if it'd still build (and if it'd still work). What actually prompted me to conduct the Mississippi tests was that, when using the app (I use it several times a day), the difference in startup time was so apparent that I initially couldn't believe it. I read about the startup improvements in the 1.4 release notes, but didn't get my hopes up.


In my experience, it's fo' real, people.


What's most important about these results is that, to me, it means that startup performance is now improved to the point that it has ceased to be a concern. As long as you're designing your apps well (making a good default.png to reduce the apparent wait time; not sticking all the UIs for your app inside a single nib; not trying to load tons of resources before your app's main window has been displayed; etc.), I think you're going to find that startup times aren't remotely the concern they once were. On top of that, I expect the MT peeps will continue to improve the product, and given what they've accomplished in such a short time, I have no doubt that we're not far from being able to forget about startup times altogether (again, provided you're designing your apps well - there's no dev platform out there that I know of that can correct for bad design).


Sorry - this has been slightly off-topic (&quot;topically-askew&quot;?), but my impression, formed from dirty tests though it may have been, is that 1.4.2 has changed the nib vs. nib-less argument, at least as far as MonoTouch is concerned. From here on, I think MT performance discussions will be more similar to the ones we'd have if we were talking about developing apps using Apple's dev stack - &quot;best practices&quot; that are true for MT and Apple's tools (the best way to design tables for performance; the best way to quickly save app state; etc.).


So, kudos to the MT brains. My fanboyness is more and more fanboyish with each release :)

It takes a XIB file and generates code for programmaticly creating the user interface.

Given the recent debate of whether or not to use XIB's, I wonder if it might make sense to convert this tool to generate C#?  It's open source on github: <A HREF="http://github.com/akosma/nib2objc/">http://github.com/akosma/nib2objc/</A>
