<PRE>It would be fantastic if we could develop cross-platform apps like  
that, but there are so many things that get in the way that it's best  
left as a good idea (for now).

To get the nice resolution-independent vector-based UIs, you couldn't  
work with CocoaTouch - you'd have to have your own rendering engine.  
That'd be fine, except that, for native apps, Apple has strict  
guidelines about how your app shoud look/feel/work. Even small  
deviations - *when using their own frameworks* - can get your app  
rejected. For the first app I worked on, I had to resubmit after  
redoing the main UI so it didn't use a grid of buttons for kicking off  
various part of the app. Yes: buttons. They were right, actually - I  
should've been using a table, and rather than buttons, I should have  
had cells.

It feels at firs like they're meddling, but the benefits far outweigh  
the limitations. By requiring devs to follow the guidelines, Apple  
practically did away with the need to give your users manuals. When  
you think about it, you've probably never, or rarely, ever had to  
consult a manual or help screen for an iPhone app. That's partly due  
to the consistency, and that consistency is largely due to the  
similarity of one UI to the next. There are some rules and there are  
some conventions (like expecting that tapping the status bar will  
scroll you to the top of a screen that vertically extends beyond the  
device's resolution).

You'd have to give up much of what's already there for you. For  
example, the keyboard - your rendering engine would need a lot of code  
for managing the keyboard (you don't control the iPhone's keyboard -  
at best, you influence it). That'd lead to temptation to make your  
own. But then you'd have to create something that would look just like  
Apple's, only you wouldn't have the &quot;free&quot; spellchecker, and there  
would undoubtedly be differences, however subtle, between it and the  
real keyboard.

iPhone users can be really sensitive to anything non-standard.  
Something I do from time to time to get a feel for what'll fly and  
what won't is to wander through the AppStore in no particular order,  
randomly tapping on apps to read the reviews.

Something I've found, for example, is that many users complain about  
web apps. I'm talking about the apps in the store that are little more  
that a launcher for a UIWebView that loads up some remote mobile site  
(albeit iPhone-optimized). Although you can do quite a bit with iPhone  
web apps, people can tell the difference. I've seen apps slammed for  
being non-native (the Bank of America app comes to mind - I use it,  
and I cringe every time).

When things aren't *just right*, then, a surprisingly large number of  
users will notice. It's weird. Users don't typically pick up on things  
like that. There are devs who can do quite a lot with iPhone web apps,  
but they'll never *feel* the way an iPhone app is &quot;supposed&quot; to.

Point being, as a dev, I want what you're describing - have wanted it  
for years (mainly because of Windows Mobile - MS just hands off WM to  
third-parties who then create devices with all sorts of features, like  
VGA screens, that other WM devices lack - the word &quot;argh&quot; comes to  
mind).

What you're left with, realistically, is a set of options that favor  
the dev but not the consumer:

- Inconsistent user experience

- To be cross-platform, apps would have to limit themselves to the  
most basic subset of controls common across the platforms. There are  
very iPhone-specific controls and frameworks (like nav and tab bar  
controllers, MapKit, etc.) that either wouldn't make sense on the  
other platforms or would be difficult to implement (to the point that  
you might as well write your app for each platform you want to target).

- You'd be subject to divergence in platforms. Like, Android might  
move in a completely different direction that could complicate this  
abstraction framework. Android is already basically the second coming  
of Windows Mobile - I don't know what's going to happen with it, but  
Google's approach has been very similar to Microsoft's, and you can  
count on trouble. With the Google/Microsoft method, &quot;cross-platform&quot;  
has a different meaning than it does in this coversation. With WM,  
your app is &quot;cross-platform&quot; if you can get it running properly on the  
majority of devices running *the same* OS. That's one reason iPhone  
development is so attractive: Apple boxes us in, but that also frees  
us from having to worry about targeting this or that model of iPhone  
(there are exceptions to this, but you can still take advantage of  
most of what the iPhone has to offer regardless of what generation  
iPhone you're targeting). I realize that the Apple tablet (which is  
supposed to be announced in January (though not sold till mid-year))  
changes this since it's running iPhone OS, and it will clearly have  
different capabilities from the iPhone. My guess is that very few apps  
will be written to support both platforms. It'll be one or the other.

- Unless this framework were freakishly well implemented, you'd likely  
end up with apps that Apple would never approve (because they wouldn't  
conform to Apple's guidelines).

- The effort required to code all this up is probably not ultimately  
worth it. Done well, it's a good idea, but there are *so* many  
obstacles.

I don't mean to be a bummer here, but I've pondered the same thing.

There are people out there now who're doing cross-platform tools, but  
many of the issues I mentioned here are present in them.

PhoneGap is a tool that provides a way of taking advantage of native  
device features from mobile web apps. You write your app as a mobile  
web app, access native features (like GPS and accelerometers) through  
a JavaScript API that handles calling the native bits for you. You  
then have the tool spit out project files for the platform of your  
choice. What you end up with is, in the case of the iPhone, an Xcode  
project that creates a web view for you and hosts your mobile app. You  
build your app and then submit it to the store. I'm not a fan, as I  
bought my iPhone because I want to take advantage of *all* it can do,  
and that goes well beyond the functionality PhoneGap gives you access  
to. It has its place, but... yeah. I just spent $500 to upgrade to a  
3G S, and I want apps that are going to justify that cost.

Another tool is Titanium Appelerator. I think that's what it's called  
- tapping this on my phone and don't really want to check.

If I recall, that one produces native apps for the iPhone and Android.  
Don't remember about others. You code using HTML/JavaScript/etc., and  
then, if I understood the manual, creates actual native apps. The  
drawback is that, although you'll get native widgets, you're still  
bound to the most basic subset of functionalty shared across the  
platforms. I see this as a step up from PhoneGap, but... still not  
good enough.

What I love about MonoTouch is that it does one thing, and it does  
that thing extremely well: it makes iPhone apps easier to develop, and  
I can use nearly every feature the iPhone has. And if there's a native  
API I want access to, but that isn't supported by MT out of the box, I  
can easily create a binding for it. Or, if I want to use some old ObjC  
code of my own, I can use it as a library from my MT project.

Like I said, I'm not trying to be a bummer - just rambling on with my  
own thought about the subject.

On the desktop, you can *almost* get away with cross-platform apps,  
but it's just never worked out well. Mobile devices are a much more  
difficult a target for this because of how much one platform (and even  
different devices running the same OS) differs from the next.

Not saying it wouldn't be nice :)
