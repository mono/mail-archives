<PRE>Hey, Orlando -

I hate to be the guy who answers a question with a question, but could  
go into a little more detail on what you're doing? Specifically, why  
you'd want to swap the nav controller out for another.

Do users only get access to settings if they buy/register the app?

I ask because, although there are times when it makes perfect sense to  
change the controllers for your tabs, you generally don't want to  
change them around unless you have to - or, using the iPod app as an  
example, when you let the user customize the tab bar.

I think I'm trying to say: I don't want to tell someone how *I* think  
their app ought to be designed - just curious because, without knowing  
more, it's hard to give the best answer. It might be totally  
unnecessary to swap controllers.

 From their names (register/settings), it does sound like, once the  
user registers, the tab goes from being the register tab to being the  
settings tab (Apple frowns on in-app settings, by the by - they want  
app settings to show up in the central Settings &quot;app&quot; - however, many  
apps don't follow this guideline, as it is, many of us would agree,  
completely insane).

Something you might consider doing is making registration something  
the user performs in your settings - then you wouldn't have to swap  
controllers (thereby avoiding confusion that could easily be caused by  
modifying your UI like that), *and* it makes more sense (to me, anyway).

If your app *doesn't* work like that, then any further details would  
be helpful. Like: is this an operation that will happen often?  
Registration, in most contexts, is a one-time thing, so it doesn't  
sound like something users would be doing often. I bring this up  
because the easiest/smartest way to do this might vary depending on  
how your app works. If registration does only happen once, then you'll  
want this UI change persisted across app sessions. If I were writing  
this app, I'd take different approaches depending on how registration  
works.

Sorry to write back with so many questions. A decision like this isn't  
always just technical - with the iPhone, it can be the kind of thing  
that, from a design standpoint, can make a difference in your app  
getting accepted/rejected (probably not a problem, but anytime you can  
simplify/consolidate your UI, you decrease your chances of rubbing the  
App Store approvers the wrong way).
