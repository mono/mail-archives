<PRE>You're probably right Rory. I've thought about this as well. It does
seem like some of the silverlight dev experience might make it's way
here though (while still compiling to native bits). Perhaps a bit of
declarative ui with xaml that offered a subset of features,
databinding for instance and/or a xaml facade over core animation
maybe; so one could design animations using a tool like blend and then
port it over to the iphone (I recall someone mentioning this in irc a
while back).

...you typed all that from your iPhone, wow! :)

&gt;<i> It would be fantastic if we could develop cross-platform apps like
</I>&gt;<i> that, but there are so many things that get in the way that it's best
</I>&gt;<i> left as a good idea (for now).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To get the nice resolution-independent vector-based UIs, you couldn't
</I>&gt;<i> work with CocoaTouch - you'd have to have your own rendering engine.
</I>&gt;<i> That'd be fine, except that, for native apps, Apple has strict
</I>&gt;<i> guidelines about how your app shoud look/feel/work. Even small
</I>&gt;<i> deviations - *when using their own frameworks* - can get your app
</I>&gt;<i> rejected. For the first app I worked on, I had to resubmit after
</I>&gt;<i> redoing the main UI so it didn't use a grid of buttons for kicking off
</I>&gt;<i> various part of the app. Yes: buttons. They were right, actually - I
</I>&gt;<i> should've been using a table, and rather than buttons, I should have
</I>&gt;<i> had cells.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It feels at firs like they're meddling, but the benefits far outweigh
</I>&gt;<i> the limitations. By requiring devs to follow the guidelines, Apple
</I>&gt;<i> practically did away with the need to give your users manuals. When
</I>&gt;<i> you think about it, you've probably never, or rarely, ever had to
</I>&gt;<i> consult a manual or help screen for an iPhone app. That's partly due
</I>&gt;<i> to the consistency, and that consistency is largely due to the
</I>&gt;<i> similarity of one UI to the next. There are some rules and there are
</I>&gt;<i> some conventions (like expecting that tapping the status bar will
</I>&gt;<i> scroll you to the top of a screen that vertically extends beyond the
</I>&gt;<i> device's resolution).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You'd have to give up much of what's already there for you. For
</I>&gt;<i> example, the keyboard - your rendering engine would need a lot of code
</I>&gt;<i> for managing the keyboard (you don't control the iPhone's keyboard -
</I>&gt;<i> at best, you influence it). That'd lead to temptation to make your
</I>&gt;<i> own. But then you'd have to create something that would look just like
</I>&gt;<i> Apple's, only you wouldn't have the &quot;free&quot; spellchecker, and there
</I>&gt;<i> would undoubtedly be differences, however subtle, between it and the
</I>&gt;<i> real keyboard.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> iPhone users can be really sensitive to anything non-standard.
</I>&gt;<i> Something I do from time to time to get a feel for what'll fly and
</I>&gt;<i> what won't is to wander through the AppStore in no particular order,
</I>&gt;<i> randomly tapping on apps to read the reviews.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Something I've found, for example, is that many users complain about
</I>&gt;<i> web apps. I'm talking about the apps in the store that are little more
</I>&gt;<i> that a launcher for a UIWebView that loads up some remote mobile site
</I>&gt;<i> (albeit iPhone-optimized). Although you can do quite a bit with iPhone
</I>&gt;<i> web apps, people can tell the difference. I've seen apps slammed for
</I>&gt;<i> being non-native (the Bank of America app comes to mind - I use it,
</I>&gt;<i> and I cringe every time).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When things aren't *just right*, then, a surprisingly large number of
</I>&gt;<i> users will notice. It's weird. Users don't typically pick up on things
</I>&gt;<i> like that. There are devs who can do quite a lot with iPhone web apps,
</I>&gt;<i> but they'll never *feel* the way an iPhone app is &quot;supposed&quot; to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Point being, as a dev, I want what you're describing - have wanted it
</I>&gt;<i> for years (mainly because of Windows Mobile - MS just hands off WM to
</I>&gt;<i> third-parties who then create devices with all sorts of features, like
</I>&gt;<i> VGA screens, that other WM devices lack - the word &quot;argh&quot; comes to
</I>&gt;<i> mind).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What you're left with, realistically, is a set of options that favor
</I>&gt;<i> the dev but not the consumer:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Inconsistent user experience
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - To be cross-platform, apps would have to limit themselves to the
</I>&gt;<i> most basic subset of controls common across the platforms. There are
</I>&gt;<i> very iPhone-specific controls and frameworks (like nav and tab bar
</I>&gt;<i> controllers, MapKit, etc.) that either wouldn't make sense on the
</I>&gt;<i> other platforms or would be difficult to implement (to the point that
</I>&gt;<i> you might as well write your app for each platform you want to target).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - You'd be subject to divergence in platforms. Like, Android might
</I>&gt;<i> move in a completely different direction that could complicate this
</I>&gt;<i> abstraction framework. Android is already basically the second coming
</I>&gt;<i> of Windows Mobile - I don't know what's going to happen with it, but
</I>&gt;<i> Google's approach has been very similar to Microsoft's, and you can
</I>&gt;<i> count on trouble. With the Google/Microsoft method, &quot;cross-platform&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> has a different meaning than it does in this coversation. With WM,
</I>&gt;<i> your app is &quot;cross-platform&quot; if you can get it running properly on the
</I>&gt;<i> majority of devices running *the same* OS. That's one reason iPhone
</I>&gt;<i> development is so attractive: Apple boxes us in, but that also frees
</I>&gt;<i> us from having to worry about targeting this or that model of iPhone
</I>&gt;<i> (there are exceptions to this, but you can still take advantage of
</I>&gt;<i> most of what the iPhone has to offer regardless of what generation
</I>&gt;<i> iPhone you're targeting). I realize that the Apple tablet (which is
</I>&gt;<i> supposed to be announced in January (though not sold till mid-year))
</I>&gt;<i> changes this since it's running iPhone OS, and it will clearly have
</I>&gt;<i> different capabilities from the iPhone. My guess is that very few apps
</I>&gt;<i> will be written to support both platforms. It'll be one or the other.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Unless this framework were freakishly well implemented, you'd likely
</I>&gt;<i> end up with apps that Apple would never approve (because they wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> conform to Apple's guidelines).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - The effort required to code all this up is probably not ultimately
</I>&gt;<i> worth it. Done well, it's a good idea, but there are *so* many
</I>&gt;<i> obstacles.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't mean to be a bummer here, but I've pondered the same thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are people out there now who're doing cross-platform tools, but
</I>&gt;<i> many of the issues I mentioned here are present in them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PhoneGap is a tool that provides a way of taking advantage of native
</I>&gt;<i> device features from mobile web apps. You write your app as a mobile
</I>&gt;<i> web app, access native features (like GPS and accelerometers) through
</I>&gt;<i> a JavaScript API that handles calling the native bits for you. You
</I>&gt;<i> then have the tool spit out project files for the platform of your
</I>&gt;<i> choice. What you end up with is, in the case of the iPhone, an Xcode
</I>&gt;<i> project that creates a web view for you and hosts your mobile app. You
</I>&gt;<i> build your app and then submit it to the store. I'm not a fan, as I
</I>&gt;<i> bought my iPhone because I want to take advantage of *all* it can do,
</I>&gt;<i> and that goes well beyond the functionality PhoneGap gives you access
</I>&gt;<i> to. It has its place, but... yeah. I just spent $500 to upgrade to a
</I>&gt;<i> 3G S, and I want apps that are going to justify that cost.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another tool is Titanium Appelerator. I think that's what it's called
</I>&gt;<i> - tapping this on my phone and don't really want to check.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I recall, that one produces native apps for the iPhone and Android.
</I>&gt;<i> Don't remember about others. You code using HTML/JavaScript/etc., and
</I>&gt;<i> then, if I understood the manual, creates actual native apps. The
</I>&gt;<i> drawback is that, although you'll get native widgets, you're still
</I>&gt;<i> bound to the most basic subset of functionalty shared across the
</I>&gt;<i> platforms. I see this as a step up from PhoneGap, but... still not
</I>&gt;<i> good enough.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I love about MonoTouch is that it does one thing, and it does
</I>&gt;<i> that thing extremely well: it makes iPhone apps easier to develop, and
</I>&gt;<i> I can use nearly every feature the iPhone has. And if there's a native
</I>&gt;<i> API I want access to, but that isn't supported by MT out of the box, I
</I>&gt;<i> can easily create a binding for it. Or, if I want to use some old ObjC
</I>&gt;<i> code of my own, I can use it as a library from my MT project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Like I said, I'm not trying to be a bummer - just rambling on with my
</I>&gt;<i> own thought about the subject.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the desktop, you can *almost* get away with cross-platform apps,
</I>&gt;<i> but it's just never worked out well. Mobile devices are a much more
</I>&gt;<i> difficult a target for this because of how much one platform (and even
</I>&gt;<i> different devices running the same OS) differs from the next.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not saying it wouldn't be nice :)
