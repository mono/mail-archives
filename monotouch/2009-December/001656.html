<PRE>Hey, Tiago -

I'm away from my computer at the moment - tends to make it a little  
tougher to answer questions because I can't answer as thoroughly as  
I'd like.

That said, you can swap out the controller by assigning a new array of  
view controllers to your tab bar controller's ViewControllers property.

It'll recreate the tab bar with the new tab (in your case, the config  
tab instead of registration).

When you assign a new array of controllers to that property, the tab  
controller &quot;remembers&quot; which tab was open when the switch was  
initiated and will try to return to that tab. I'm pretty sure (typing  
on my phone, so getting to docs would be kind of a pain - I believe  
this is correct, though) it decides which tab to open based on index.  
So, if your registration tab was the fourth tab (for example), the tab  
controller will automatically reload with the fourth tab selected,  
even if the controller for the forth tab has changed.

I haven't tried to do this yet in a real app (played with it briefly  
over the weekend), but you could probably do something like this (I'm  
assuming your config tab is last - also, apologies if I screw up any  
syntax here - the iPhone is currently providing me code-completion  
with its spell-checker, which is suboptimal):

UIViewController[] controllers = new UIViewController 
[tabController.ViewControllers.Length] { tabController.ViewControllers 
[0], tabController.ViewControllers[1], tabController.ViewControllers 
[2], new ConfigViewController() };

tabController.ViewControllers = controllers;

----

How you choose to persist the change between runs is up to you. I'd  
probably use the functionality specified in the NSCoding protocol to  
archive the tab controller's view controllers, but a simpler way to do  
it for now would be to have a &quot;registered&quot; flag set in user defaults -  
if, at startup, that flag is set, then just create the view controller  
array with the config tab rather than the registration tab.

Hope this helps. When I get back to my computer, I could package up a  
really simple little example for you and then make the project  
available for download - just let me know :)

</I>&gt;<i> The application has two &quot;states&quot;, one before the user register  
</I>&gt;<i> himself with &quot;us&quot; and another when the user is already registered.  
</I>&gt;<i> So there should be a Tab where he can register himself. This state,

</I>&gt;<i> the user is not registered, only the &quot;online&quot; parts of the  
</I>&gt;<i> application are not available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if / when the user decides to register himself with our service,  
</I>&gt;<i> there will be some configurations (not settings) that will replace  
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;Registration&quot; tab. So following the guidelines configurations  
</I>&gt;<i> can be kept inside the app, only settings should go away. (I agree  
</I>&gt;<i> that this is strange, but it's Apple so we have to accept it :-) ).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The tabs are built &quot;programmatically&quot; so if the user is already  
</I>&gt;<i> registered the RegisterTab will never be included in the controller.  
</I>&gt;<i> But in the moment that the user register himself with us, we need to  
</I>&gt;<i> remove that tab and replace it with another tab (configurations).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hope that I managed to explain what we are trying to achieve. And  
</I>&gt;<i> that Orlando doesn't complain that I replied by him :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards

</I>&gt;<i> Hey, Orlando -
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hate to be the guy who answers a question with a question, but  
</I>&gt;<i> could go into a little more detail on what you're doing?  
</I>&gt;<i> Specifically, why you'd want to swap the nav controller out for  
</I>&gt;<i> another.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do users only get access to settings if they buy/register the app?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I ask because, although there are times when it makes perfect sense  
</I>&gt;<i> to change the controllers for your tabs, you generally don't want to  
</I>&gt;<i> change them around unless you have to - or, using the iPod app as an  
</I>&gt;<i> example, when you let the user customize the tab bar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think I'm trying to say: I don't want to tell someone how *I*  
</I>&gt;<i> think their app ought to be designed - just curious because, without  
</I>&gt;<i> knowing more, it's hard to give the best answer. It might be totally  
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessary to swap controllers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From their names (register/settings), it does sound like, once the  
</I>&gt;<i> user registers, the tab goes from being the register tab to being  
</I>&gt;<i> the settings tab (Apple frowns on in-app settings, by the by - they  
</I>&gt;<i> want app settings to show up in the central Settings &quot;app&quot; -  
</I>&gt;<i> however, many apps don't follow this guideline, as it is, many of us  
</I>&gt;<i> would agree, completely insane).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Something you might consider doing is making registration something  
</I>&gt;<i> the user performs in your settings - then you wouldn't have to swap  
</I>&gt;<i> controllers (thereby avoiding confusion that could easily be caused  
</I>&gt;<i> by modifying your UI like that), *and* it makes more sense (to me,  
</I>&gt;<i> anyway).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If your app *doesn't* work like that, then any further details would  
</I>&gt;<i> be helpful. Like: is this an operation that will happen often?  
</I>&gt;<i> Registration, in most contexts, is a one-time thing, so it doesn't  
</I>&gt;<i> sound like something users would be doing often. I bring this up  
</I>&gt;<i> because the easiest/smartest way to do this might vary depending on  
</I>&gt;<i> how your app works. If registration does only happen once, then  
</I>&gt;<i> you'll want this UI change persisted across app sessions. If I were  
</I>&gt;<i> writing this app, I'd take different approaches depending on how  
</I>&gt;<i> registration works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry to write back with so many questions. A decision like this  
</I>&gt;<i> isn't always just technical - with the iPhone, it can be the kind of  
</I>&gt;<i> thing that, from a design standpoint, can make a difference in your  
</I>&gt;<i> app getting accepted/rejected (probably not a problem, but anytime  
</I>&gt;<i> you can simplify/consolidate your UI, you decrease your chances of  
</I>&gt;<i> rubbing the App Store approvers the wrong way).
