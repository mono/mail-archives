<PRE>Yes, this is what I do (provides full compilation on a windows box (to get
compile errors etc), along with full Resharper intellisense etc.):

Pre-requisites:
	Silverlight 3 development environment (to be able to compile in
VS.NET)

1.  (Mac) Create a solution in MonoDevelop (e.g. MySolution.sln)
2.  (Mac) Create a project in MonoDevelop (e.g. MyProject.proj) in a
sub-folder.
3.  (Mac) Copy monotouch assemblies into a folder under solution folder
4.  (Win) Use unison to synchronize solution folder from my Mac to my PC (or
use your own favourite file synchronization tool)
5.  (Win) Create a new VS.NET solution, (e.g. MySolution.VS.sln) and move
solution file into same directory as MySolution.sln
6.  (Win) Create a Silverlight 3 project, (e.g. MyProject.VS.proj) and move
project file into same directory as MyProject.proj
7.  (Win) Update the MySolution.VS.sln to reference the new location of
MyProject.VS.proj (via notepad)
8.  (Win) Open the solution, remove all the Silverlight references in the
MyProject.VS.proj project, and reference the relevant monotouch assemblies
9.  (Win) Show all files in the project, &quot;Include in Project&quot; the ones I
want to build, including the .Designer files generated from the xib
10. (Win) Add the folders to source control

Then my process for development is (cycle):
1. (Mac) Edit .xib on Mac for user interface
2. (Win) Synchronize files
3. (Win) Edit within VS.NET using Resharper, with full compilation.
4. (Win) Synchronize back to Mac
5. (Mac) Add to project any files I've added on Windows (setting build
properties as needed)
6. (Mac) Debug in simulator
7. (Mac) Edit in MD as needed
8. (Mac) Debug on device (and detect any JIT errors )
9. (Mac) Edit in MD as needed
10. (Win) Synchronize back
11. (Win) Add to VS.NET project any files I've added on Windows (setting
build properties as needed)
12. Repeat

Because I VNC into the Mac, and am swapping between VS.NET and MD a lot, I
use a keyboard mapping that makes MD feel like VS.NET (e.g. Ctrl-C, F5
etc.), this has been submitted as a patch.
Any third-party libraries I use I create a pair of projects in MD and VS.NET
(iPhone and Silverlight 3 modded) and add the files to them, then add
project references.

Variations on this would be:
- Mount the PC folder from the Mac, and not have to synchronize
- Auto-synchronize as post/pre build event on PC

Would like to get working:
- &quot;Run&quot; functionality that would ssh into the Mac, build the app, and launch
in the simulator. 
- Unit testing working on the PC (for the non-visual parts of the app.) I
haven't spent much time on that yet
- (when I have lots more free time) Implement ICorDebug over the top of the
Remote MonoDevelop protocol (or mono soft-debugger client) to allow
debugging in VS.NET

Tools I use at the moment:

Hello, I'd like to continue the thread about no-xib forms...

I'm a n00b in iPhone developing, and I would like to choose a way...

I like the idea of not having to work in any way with xcode/interface 
builder

Checking with diff tools some xib files, made in different times, with 
different passages,
but with the same objects, I find different results... xibs definition 
may vary,
and being a visual tool, you will never know how they could change...
Also, I feel the outlets model very expensive, in terms of developing 
time...
I would rather prefer building from the ground-up, all by code, the 
controls on my forms....
iPhone apps will always be very simple, anyway not complex like the 
desktop counterparts...

I usually work on a windows machine, so I've a question :

Do you think it would be possible to develop (not compile!) on a windows 
machine
using monodevelop for windows and referencig monotouch dll files copied from
the mac machine ?

It would be great for me : I could develop while traveling, designing my 
code, and
then just compiling (even remotely) on my Mac in office...

What do you feel about this ? would it result in some way a bad long-run 
solution ?

Or would it be in any way better than relying on the IB changes ?
(as an example, this week ibtool was not working anymore with monotouch, 
as I didn't
update it...)

Best Regards
