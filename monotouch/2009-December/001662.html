<PRE>[Note: As always, my response is a long one. In this one, I talk about: 1) Asking yourself why you're using sqlite (is it the right tool for the job?), 2) Some of the alternatives for data-storage and where they might be best used, 3) Third-party sqlite wrappers vs. MT's APIs, 4) A brief introduction to Instruments (Apple's profiling tool, which is actually pretty slick) that might help you determine which API to use based on how much it taxes the phone (for example, is all the comfy abstraction of [some wrapper] bringing with it serious penalties in the form of CPU and/or memory hogging? Wouldn't it be nice to know?).] 

---- Thing One: Why sqlite?

First thing I'd say is: Ask yourself why you're using sqlite.

This isn't going to be a straightforward answer to your question - somebody else will probably do a good job of that - but if you're new to the platform, and I know how straight-up weird it can be to get started with the iPhone (depending on your background - for me, it was weird), I think it's worth your while to consider data storage options beyond sqlite, and to have some idea of where to start looking/researching these other modes of storage.

To a .Net dev, relational DBs are almost a given (yes: I know there are exceptions, but I think it's a fair assumption, especially given the kind of work .Net devs tend to do (most .Net work I've done has involved the web and data access - your usual multiuser apps that require a centralized, high-performance data store).

You mentioned in 3.Pro2 that Mono.Data.SqliteClient &quot;gets [you] closer to the raw iPhone programming mindset should [you] ever migrate to Objective-C.&quot;

It's totally subjective (I don't want to push my viewpoint on anybody else), but after doing a year of native iPhone development, I feel that it's very much in your best interests to learn as much as you can as you go about The iPhone Way. MonoTouch gives us a fantastic platform for development, but the underlying platform we're targeting, and the idiosyncrasies of that platform, are sufficiently strange and foreign to The .Net Way that I think you've got the right attitude (if your goal is to become a good iPhone developer - not just a MonoTouch or Objective-C developer).

So, with that in mind, ask yourself what you're going for here:

- Performance?
- ORM? (sounds like you definitely want this one)
- Being able to use some .Net code you've already got lying around?
- ...?

As I learn more and more about MonoTouch (which, I often like to add, has taught me more and more about iPhone development in general (that is, it improves my understanding of the Objective-C side of things)), I've decided, for the time being, that my preference is for a mix of approaches. It's somewhat inconvenient, but a good app built with Apple's stack will also have a mixed approach to data storage.

---- Thing Two: Some alternatives to sqlite and where/why you might use them

For keeping track of some aspects of app state, NSUserDefaults is sufficient. It's pretty well-documented (reading the Apple docs and the MonoTouch docs side-by-side can help you make the most sense of things - it'll also teach you more about The iPhone Way), and it's easy to get started with.

For freeze-drying my app's UI state, I prefer to use what the NSCoding protocol offers (a &quot;protocol&quot; is roughly the same thing as an interface in C# - the difference is that protocols don't necessarily have to be implemented in their entirety - so, when you see the word &quot;protocol&quot; in the context of your code, that's what the Apple peeps are talking about). NSCoding and some of its associated bits (NSKeyedArchiver/NSKeyedUnarchiver) have been implemented in MonoTouch. They're a little buggy, but getting there. I really need to write a tutorial on this stuff - I talk a lot about NSCoding, but have yet to provide a good example of why it's so spiffy.

Those last two options are native bits, and the bindings are nice - they're just .Net-i-fied to the point that you don't have to think too much when using them. The layer of abstraction, then, is light. While I would rather go with a 100% .Net based solution, using aspects of the .Net framework I'm familiar with for data storage, I also want to be mindful of the trade-offs between abstraction and resource use. Unlike Windows Mobile, the iPhone doesn't provide you a friendly managed environment that lets you &quot;get away with&quot;... well, the things you can get away with on Windows Mobile. Try the same things on the iPhone, and apps are liable to crash (this happens to the best of apps - I've used very, very few iPhone apps that didn't, from time to time, just give up and die).

So, I get C#, and I get a nice subset of the .Net framework I love, and for the most part it's been just frikkin' fantastic (yes: I'm a fanboy), but for some things I still look at the most iPhone-y way of doing things first - after that, I'll ponder what the trade-off, if any, would be to go with the more .Net-y options.

Looks like you're already doing that, which is awesome.

---- Thing Three: Third-party sqlite wrappers vs. MT's APIs

Now that I've written some about my approach and experiences, here's a more direct response to your question:

I think your assessment of the pros and cons is pretty right on. At the very least, it's a good starting point for a discussion that could be turned into a table that could be added to the docs to help devs figure out which choice represents &quot;the right tool for the job&quot;.

For your purposes, you're probably safe with your choice. Going with a third-party library, as your comments regarding option 4 demonstrate, comes with the risk of development petering out (we've all seen popular online repositories and how they eventually become graveyards of projects that die right after the devs agree on which obscure variation of this-or-that OSS license to use).

The built-in MonoTouch support for sqlite is still in preview mode, so some wonkiness is to be expected. However, regarding wasted resources, I expect that the implementation will ultimately be pretty speedy, all things considered. Your options for storage on the iPhone are sufficiently limited (by Apple) that the MT peeps are in the position to create a nicely optimized set of bits for sqlite access while still providing the familiar .Net API goodness you're used to. That is, the API will look the same, but it's a realistic option here to make the familiarity superficial. I don't know if that's where things are going - this is a part of MT I haven't looked into too much yet - but I trust the MTers will do a good job on this (like they have with the rest of the project).

---- Thing Four: Profiling with Instruments

Whatever you do, I strongly recommend that, if your app is going to be resource-intensive, familiarize yourself with Apple's profiling tools - get Instruments up and running and play around with it. Just tether your phone, run Instruments, select the &quot;Activity Monitor&quot; from the palette of options (make sure you have &quot;iPhone&quot; selected so you're getting the right bits), go to the &quot;Default Target&quot; drop-down box on the main window (you'll get to the main window after the initial setup where you specify what aspects of the system you want to watch), make sure your phone is in the list and that it's selected, and then, in the same list, click &quot;All Processes&quot;. When you've done that, hit the Record button and watch the stats fly by (you can ignore most of the different reported types of memory - just pay attention to &quot;Real Memory&quot;). This is a great way to see what kind of resources other apps are using, and, once you have your app running on the device, you can watch it in the list and see how it stacks up. It might be that memory and CPU usage will vary wildly depending on which sqlite API you choose. If your app ends up eating CPU cycles (read: battery), or if it's constantly hovering around 20+MB of memory use (read: is probably going to be crash-happy), then you might want to give one of the others a try.

I know it isn't a simple task to &quot;just&quot; rewrite your code using a different sqlite API, but if your app is working with a lot of data, it's probably worth it to examine your options by writing simple test apps that hit the DB the way your real app will.

---- Thing Final: Random thoughts

Anyway, I hope this helps. I always worry that I provide too much info and that I end up confusing rather than clarifying.

I learned a lot in the time I was doing iPhone development with Apple's dev stack, and part of what I learned is that, if you want to write quality iPhone apps (regardless of which dev tools you choose), there's a lot to consider, and it isn't always obvious what the right tool is for the job.

But, as I said earlier, for someone looking to get into iPhone development, I think your instincts are good :)

&gt;<i> Hello all I am new here and also new to iPhone development. I spent the day reading up on my options for coding SQLite data access within MonoTouch and get the impression things are evolving. Would anyone care to comment on my assessment so far?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1 - New MonoTouch 1.2 System.Data library.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Pro: Familiar dotNet coding model.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Con1: Takes me back to 2001 vintage dotnet programming with manual coding of object mapping.
</I>&gt;<i> Con2: Probably wasted use of machine resources traversing through .Net library code before calling out to native sqlite3.dll.
</I>&gt;<i> Con3: Possibly a larger binary package in the app store
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2 - sqlite-net project at code google.com
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Pro1: Does simple mapping of result sets to entity classes.
</I>&gt;<i> Pro2: Minimal attribute annotation to get up and running.
</I>&gt;<i> Pro3: Database schema generation thrown in as a bonus.
</I>&gt;<i> Pro4: Lightweight with zero dependancies.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Con1: No concept of UnitOfWork for automatic entity updates.
</I>&gt;<i> Con2: No concept of data model with entity relationships.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3 - Mono.Data.SqliteClient wrapper to native iPhone sqlite library.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Pro1: Least intermediate code.
</I>&gt;<i> Pro2: Gets me closer to the raw iPhone programming mindset should I migrate to Objective-C.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Con1: Some source code bulk doing manual entity mapping.
</I>&gt;<i> Con2: Same dated design mindset as System.Data.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4 - catnap-orm at code google
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Pro1: Fully formed mini ORM with mapping of entity relationships and collections.
</I>&gt;<i> Pro2: UnitOfWork supports auto generation of update SQL.
</I>&gt;<i> Pro3: Still fairly lightweight @ 100k
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Con1: Author seemed to give up with arrival of System.Data in 1.2
</I>&gt;<i> Con2: Dependancy for me on a fairly complex and new body of code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5 - Cocoa Core.Data
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Nhibernate level ORM library but not bound into MonoTouch. Probably too resource hungry for a 25Mb iPhone process space anyhow.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Conclusion, I am leaning towards the basic mapping capabilities of option 2 (sqlite-net). What do you all think?
