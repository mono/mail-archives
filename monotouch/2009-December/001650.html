<PRE>Hi,

I work with Orlando so I know what he is trying to achieve.

I will try to answer your questions, to the best of my knowledge.

The application has two &quot;states&quot;, one before the user register himself with
&quot;us&quot; and another when the user is already registered. So there should be a
Tab where he can register himself. This state, exists because we want to
make the application functional, even if the user is not registered, only
the &quot;online&quot; parts of the application are not available.

So if / when the user decides to register himself with our service, there
will be some configurations (not settings) that will replace the
&quot;Registration&quot; tab. So following the guidelines configurations can be kept
inside the app, only settings should go away. (I agree that this is strange,
but it's Apple so we have to accept it :-) ).

The tabs are built &quot;programmatically&quot; so if the user is already registered
the RegisterTab will never be included in the controller. But in the moment
that the user register himself with us, we need to remove that tab and
replace it with another tab (configurations).

Hope that I managed to explain what we are trying to achieve. And that
Orlando doesn't complain that I replied by him :-)

Best regards

</I>&gt;<i> I ask because, although there are times when it makes perfect sense to

</I>&gt;<i> you let the user customize the tab bar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think I'm trying to say: I don't want to tell someone how *I* think their
</I>&gt;<i> app ought to be designed - just curious because, without knowing more, it's
</I>&gt;<i> hard to give the best answer. It might be totally unnecessary to swap
</I>&gt;<i> controllers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From their names (register/settings), it does sound like, once the user
</I>&gt;<i> registers, the tab goes from being the register tab to being the settings
</I>&gt;<i> tab (Apple frowns on in-app settings, by the by - they want app settings to
</I>&gt;<i> show up in the central Settings &quot;app&quot; - however, many apps don't follow this
</I>&gt;<i> guideline, as it is, many of us would agree, completely insane).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Something you might consider doing is making registration something the
</I>&gt;<i> user performs in your settings - then you wouldn't have to swap controllers
</I>&gt;<i> (thereby avoiding confusion that could easily be caused by modifying your UI
</I>&gt;<i> like that), *and* it makes more sense (to me, anyway).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If your app *doesn't* work like that, then any further details would be
</I>&gt;<i> helpful. Like: is this an operation that will happen often? Registration, in
</I>&gt;<i> most contexts, is a one-time thing, so it doesn't sound like something users
</I>&gt;<i> would be doing often. I bring this up because the easiest/smartest way to do
</I>&gt;<i> this might vary depending on how your app works. If registration does only
</I>&gt;<i> happen once, then you'll want this UI change persisted across app sessions.
</I>&gt;<i> If I were writing this app, I'd take different approaches depending on how
</I>&gt;<i> registration works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry to write back with so many questions. A decision like this isn't
</I>&gt;<i> always just technical - with the iPhone, it can be the kind of thing that,
</I>&gt;<i> from a design standpoint, can make a difference in your app getting
</I>&gt;<i> accepted/rejected (probably not a problem, but anytime you can
</I>&gt;<i> simplify/consolidate your UI, you decrease your chances of rubbing the App
</I>&gt;<i> Store approvers the wrong way).
