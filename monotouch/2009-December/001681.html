<PRE>
Hello, I'd like to continue the thread about no-xib forms...

I'm a n00b in iPhone developing, and I would like to choose a way...

I like the idea of not having to work in any way with xcode/interface 
builder

Checking with diff tools some xib files, made in different times, with 
different passages,
but with the same objects, I find different results... xibs definition 
may vary,
and being a visual tool, you will never know how they could change...
Also, I feel the outlets model very expensive, in terms of developing 
time...
I would rather prefer building from the ground-up, all by code, the 
controls on my forms....
iPhone apps will always be very simple, anyway not complex like the 
desktop counterparts...

I usually work on a windows machine, so I've a question :

Do you think it would be possible to develop (not compile!) on a windows 
machine
using monodevelop for windows and referencig monotouch dll files copied from
the mac machine ?

It would be great for me : I could develop while traveling, designing my 
code, and
then just compiling (even remotely) on my Mac in office...

What do you feel about this ? would it result in some way a bad long-run 
solution ?

Or would it be in any way better than relying on the IB changes ?
(as an example, this week ibtool was not working anymore with monotouch, 
as I didn't
update it...)

Best Regards
