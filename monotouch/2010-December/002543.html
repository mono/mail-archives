&gt;<i> hi all, i have a small question about monotouch if someone can help it will be highly appriciated.. i wasn't able to understand from the FAQ if a distribution of a monotouch based application comes with a monotouch dll in it or not...

Applications built with MonoTouch and distributed via the app store (aka &quot;release builds&quot;) will contain &quot;reflection-only&quot; versions of all assemblies used in the application.  (&quot;Reflection only&quot; meaning that namespaces, types, method signatures, etc. are present within the assemblies, but method bodies are NOT.  The assemblies are thus only useful for Reflection purposes and can't be used to JIT, etc.)

&gt;<i> i'm trying to understand if monotouch only compiles the .NET code into native objective-c code
</I>
The MonoTouch toolchain compiles down to ARM _machine code_.  Objective-C and assembly _also_ compile down to ARM machine code.  Thus, much of the resulting output is (conceptually) the same between MonoTouch and Objective-C.

&gt;<i> and the final code does not depend on any monotouch assembly and &quot;looks&quot; like it was developed in objective-c, or if the final app file will contain monotouch assembly in it and depend on it.
</I>
At the machine-code level, MonoTouch apps are nigh-identical to Objective-C apps -- they're all ARM machine code.

It's at the packaging level that you see differences: MonoTouch apps include reflection-only copies of all assemblies that your application uses, plus ARM Ahead-Of-Time-compiled versions of those assemblies (before they were lobotomized for reflection-only use), and any other resources that the app depends on (which Objective-C apps will also require -- images, movies, etc.).

In short, it would not be difficult to inspect a .ipa and determine that it's a MonoTouch app...but does this really matter?
