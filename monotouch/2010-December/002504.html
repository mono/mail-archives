Yes, we don't yet support per-configuration Info.plists. You could use
prebuild commands to modify the Info.plist, though that seems hacky.

&gt;<i> 2. I can (can I?) reference the same files from different projects. each of

</I>&gt;<i> settings for display name and icon files. this approach can be nightmare

</I>&gt;<i> I need to add something to the app.
</I>
This is an option. If you add files from outside the current project's
directory, MD will offer to link, copy or move them. You probably want
links.

We have been working on support for content files and xibs in
MonoTouch library projects, but I don't have an ETA for releasing this
feature.
