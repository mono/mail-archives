<PRE>Howdy

that's Iki's setup... We work together... He's got divorced because he 
loved his Apple gadgets more
than his wife Mia....
He's gonna kill me after this crap...

Further inline...

&gt;<i> Hello Bjarke,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Im working mostly inside Monodevelop on mac, but i do also have windows 7 in vmware with Unity enabled, this way I'm running visual studio or any windows app directly on mac without the need for switching back and forth between mac and win, and its working great, you can't tell that its running inside VM.
</I>Iki is in charge for MT stuff, few other guys for MA or WP.

On Friday friend of mine finally helped us with extending MonoTouch 
Dialog to WP, he is XAML expert, but I could not
convince him to work with us (we work together, but on other projects). 
He forked our MonoMobile.Dialog on
github and in few hours stuffI (we) did looked great...
We had problems with getting used to git (for him), manual merge (all 
files were poisoned cos of NewLine issues).
I still have to merge some smaller issues, but we got insights that git 
is one way to go.

I work mostly with VS, because of Project Linker, VS productivity tools, 
VS commands. Last week Iki and I added
custom cell extension to MT.D. He did bunch of tests and experiments and 
when cell appeared I was in charge
for clean-up and refactoring. So my process was to push to github, pull 
on windows side and work in VS2010.
Copy, paste-as-link (for file or folder) extensions in VS just help me 
to be faster... I could write a essay (and am
planning) what MonoDevelop should implement to fill the gaps that VS 
leaves behind - and could be a
great business case...

BTW Our team made compilation of ideas and suggestions to Jarek Kardas 
developer of VS commands.
Those ideas were mostly from our experience and needs and within month 
or so he implemented

  * folder copy-paste as link (I'm just about to write him a report that
    it breaks on VS &quot;unknown&quot;
    filetypes like xibs
  * partialize - make class partial or split existing class into &quot;old&quot;
    code and new empty file with
    partial class
    It is hard to believe that VS templates for class are still  not
    partial!
    This is big opportunity for MD.
  * oh yes - I hated copy/paste with &quot;Copy of...&quot;... It moved file
    usually &quot;out of sight&quot;
    Jarek intecepted it and now we have &quot;Item - copy&quot; and it is not far
    away in VS...
    MD does it right!!

So I do refactoring and porting - mostly VS. When everything compiles. 
Close VS open MD on Windows...
Compile/fix - usually nothing...
Then 2 ways:

  * either move/copy to Mac over share (even tried build over network share)
    this might impose problems - mac has some extra attributes for
    security (besides ACL)
    if files are copied over network (web or share)
    Besides - lags/delays might impose some weird behavior
      We've seen some similar issues with first SSDs last summer - Xcode
    or MD errors or crashes
  *   or push/commit to git/svn and then pull
    this is problem if half-baked job is commited just to be moved to
    other platform, but if team
    agrees it is ok.


Bottom line: get familiar with git and/or svn, consider shares (NAS) for 
&quot;fast switching&quot; work with
MD and VS...  There is a lot to learn and do, but that;s the name of 
this game....

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One thing that enables this to work smoothly is SSD ;)
</I>Yes he's got SSD... - get one!
My Vista is 20-40% faster since I got Vertex 4. I know SATA3 on SATA2 
interface, but this is least
we can do to speed up our boxes... We are busting our butts of to get 
money for new ones at
least 8GiBs RAM, 512 GiBs SSD...

regards

mel

BTW
Iki was never married - just Apple freak
