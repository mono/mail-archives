<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Paul can correct me on this, but I believe Ubuntu is not the only
</I>&gt;<i> distribution on a 6-month schedule - Fedora's last four releases (and
</I>&gt;<i> their next one) seem to be released in late May and late November. For
</I>&gt;<i> Ubuntu, releases are in late April and October.
</I>
Fedora does 3 a year, though depending on the release schedule, it can
be miss (it's every 4 months, but they're not released jan/may/dec
exactly, so there can be over-runs, show stoppers and the such).

What's the release schedule for Mandriva these days?

&gt;<i> Given the need for thorough testing, and the frequent major changes
</I>&gt;<i> between upstream versions, even if the dates matched up perfectly, I
</I>&gt;<i> doubt we'd ever be able to include a &quot;current&quot; Mono in a stable release
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e. by the time we have a version packaged, tested, and integrated
</I>&gt;<i> into the distro, and the distro released - a new version will be out and
</I>&gt;<i> people moaning that we're obsolete). Certainly not with 4 major releases
</I>&gt;<i> a year.
</I>
Well, 2.0.1 was shipped by default with F10, but that was by the skin of
it's teeth!

&gt;<i> The question from where I'm sat, then, becomes &quot;who benefits from your
</I>&gt;<i> 3-month proposal&quot;? If no distribution is releasing that frequently, then
</I>&gt;<i> where is the advantage in integrating a Mono release into a development
</I>&gt;<i> distro (cooker, rawhide, factory, whatever) when you know it will never
</I>&gt;<i> be part of that release?
</I>
A 3 month turn around is quite useful, but only depending on the release
dates. For example, f11 is pencilled in for March 2009. If we have a
full 2.2 release by early-mid Feb 2009, then there is a really good
chance of f11 shipping with 2.2. Obviously, YMMV depending on distro

&gt;<i> Here's my counter-proposal: In keeping with the majority of
</I>&gt;<i> distributions running on a 6-month (or approximately 6-month) schedule,
</I>&gt;<i> how about releasing major Mono versions on a 6-month basis as well? A
</I>&gt;<i> major Mono version every 6 months which warrants the packaging work
</I>&gt;<i> involved - with as many intermediary bugfix-only releases in between as
</I>&gt;<i> are deemed necessary. Packagers then know which &quot;major&quot; release they
</I>&gt;<i> need to work with, work towards, and test - and at worst they only
</I>&gt;<i> differ by minor point releases (where some or all of the point release
</I>&gt;<i> fixes may end up being used anyway).
</I>
The only thing which causes me a headache with packaging mono is fixing
the plethora of $(prefix)/lib problems for non-x86 architecture ;-) -
the actual build process is very easy.

&gt;<i> Now, time for some stats. Here's a table of major distro releases, the
</I>&gt;<i> Mono versions included, the release date, and the age of the Mono
</I>&gt;<i> release on that date. It should help to give an indication of which
</I>&gt;<i> distros need how much time to work, and point towards a good date for
</I>&gt;<i> major Mono releases:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fedora 7  | 2007/05/31 | 1.2.3   | 4 months
</I>&gt;<i> Fedora 8  | 2007/11/08 | 1.2.4   | 4 months
</I>
Both F7 and F8 are no longer supported at all.

&gt;<i> Clearly the turnaround is longer for Ubuntu than the others. There are a
</I>&gt;<i> few reasons for this, which can generally be summed up with &quot;more
</I>&gt;<i> complex packaging, more QA, more architectures&quot; - our cooperation with
</I>&gt;<i> Debian is invaluable, but also makes us weak to the sometimes (always)
</I>&gt;<i> protracted delays between Debian releases. I've declined to list Debian
</I>&gt;<i> in the table since, despite being one of the oldest Mono-containing
</I>&gt;<i> distributions, it's essentially impossible to predict or work towards
</I>&gt;<i> Debian release dates.
</I>
(speaking personally) I have always felt Debian is the achillies heal of
Ubuntu...

TTFN

Paul
