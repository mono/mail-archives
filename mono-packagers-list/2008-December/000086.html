The advantage to doing so is not cluttering up the provides output with
an entry for every non-gac assembly in an rpm when the majority of them
are not realistically consumable at runtime.

AFAICT, it solves the log4net problem as described because only the
log4net rpm would advertise a provides for mono(log4net).  It appears to
be a gac installed assembly by that rpm.  The mojoportal rpm would not
advertise a provides, because it apparently installs the assembly to a
private dir.  mojoportal would not have a requires for it since it
installs a copy itself.  smuxi on the other hand would have a requires
since it does not install log4net.dll, but instead uses the gac'd copy
from log4net.rpm
