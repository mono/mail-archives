<PRE>Hello Folks,

Since I know some of you do your packaging in your spare time I thought
I'd better get this out there today rather than Monday:  Barring any
unforeseen tragedy we plan to release the current contents of the Mono
Preview 2.6.7 as a Final build on Monday.

Sources are here:
<A HREF="http://mono.ximian.com/monobuild/preview/sources-preview/">http://mono.ximian.com/monobuild/preview/sources-preview/</A>

Only mono and libgdiplus are 2.6.7, xsp is at 2.6.5, everything else is
unchanged since the 2.6.4 release.

If you missed the earlier explanation the 2.6.5 sources were born of a
Mono Tools for Visual Studio beta so don't be alarmed.

We don't plan to make another 2.6.x release in the near future so if
there are fixes in branches/mono-2-6 after r160080 that you want you'll
want to take patches.  2.6.7 should soon become our next enterprise
release.  Or 2.6.7.1 maybe.  We'll see after we do some more QA.

If for some reason you were following my .spec file for mono-core you'll
want to note that there are some changes to the mono-data and mono-wcf
packages to try to break up some circular deps and correct some
confusion about what's in WCF and what's in core.  This work is not
complete but it's better.  I confess sometimes I think the Debian way of
putting one assembly per package is better.

And Paul, we did bump libgdiplus to 2.6.7 for the libpng fix.

Please ask me questions if I missed some detail you need.

Have a good weekend!

Andrew Jorgensen
