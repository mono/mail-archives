<PRE>Hi,

I'm the mono maintainer of Arch Linux and I would really like to package
and push the mono framework and monodevelop to the next stable release out
there. But it is totally not possible to find out what the latest stable
release of mono (and subpackages) and monodevelop is on the servers.

Since ages there is mono 3.x out there but it's stated as beta on the
official download page. Monodevelop latest release is 4.0.8, but it isn't
possible to compile it because it's complaining about missing dependency. I
would really like to support the mono developers and provide the latest
packages to our community, but with all the splitted sources and packages
and absolutely no information about a release, it is not possible to
maintain this.

This is a call to the mono developers / Xamarin to change this and to
provide us packagers with the information we need to package mono and the
related packages for our distribution.

I don't want to click anymore through github repositories and outdated
webpages on mono-project.com to get the information I need.

A webpage with information about the latest (stable) packages and links to
the source tarballs would be perfect! In the past this was done, but since
Xamarin has taken the development this page doesn't exists anymore.

I'm really disappointed at the moment with the information policy of
Xamarin and the packager for Linux distribution.

I really hope that there will be an answer for this call.

Cheers
 - Daniel
