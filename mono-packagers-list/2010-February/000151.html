are planning to release very soon now and which has a good chance of
becoming our next supported release (well at least 2.6.4 does, and I
don't anticipate too many more changes.) 2.4.x may not get a whole lot
of love in the next years, but 2.6 should as it's the last branch
supporting the 1.0 / 1.1 profile.

FeatureFreeze is Thursday (!), so already I'm having to pull a few
favours to get an update in post-freeze. There's certainly no chance
of getting anything more than a bugfix release into the distro at this
point, but the mono-2-4 branch has been repeatedly referred to by
Miguel as a long-term-support release both on IRC and at FOSDEM, and
it aligns us with SLE11 and the SLE10 paid addon. To an extent &quot;a
whole lot of love&quot; isn't an issue for us, as long as the usual
security fixes and so on appear on the branch which the distro
maintenance folks can cherry-pick from as required.

We have every intention of offering an unofficial repository for more
recent versions, on the understanding that it's not supported by the
distro team, but we don't want to begin work on that until we have a
&quot;final&quot; release in the distro proper.
