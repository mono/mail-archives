Hey,

I'm pretty sure we had this discussion when we updated the suse database =
last year. Anyway what I recall is:

a. libgdiplus &quot;own&quot; sources are MIT.X11
b. libgdiplus SVN (and tarballs) includes cairo, which (iirc) is LGPL/MPL
c. the final package* becomes LGPL/MPL (like cairo)

* actually if people are building without the embedded cairo (possible =
since 2.4) then it should be all MIT.X11 (if they take care of stripping =
all cairo/pixman sources from the distribution)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Andrew Jorgensen 09/03/09 3:24 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;
Can you clarify this for us?  Also can the svn tree be fixed so that this =
question doesn't come up again?

Hello,

I'm almost certain libgdiplus is offered under an MIT/X11 license, as
indicated by COPYING and by the individual source files; but the
LICENSE and MPL-1.1.html claim that it is under the Mozilla Public
License, version 1.1.

As this might be confusing, could I get a clarification about whether
the correct license is MIT, MPL, or dual-licensed?

Thanks,
