+    &lt;h1&gt;Todd's MonoDevelop Todo List&lt;/h1&gt;
+
+    &lt;p&gt;Here is a list of stuff that is on my todo list for MD. Some of these
+      are huge, others are smaller. All of them need to get done and I will 
+      be implementing them over time. They are not listed in any
+      particular order at all. And if anyone starts to implement one and
+      wants my help, or just wants to do it on their own, and submits
+      patch(es) for them I won't be offended. I promise. If you have
+      any questions regarding this list, email either the
+      &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monodevelop-patches-list">monodevelop-list at lists.ximian.com</A>&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; or
+      &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monodevelop-patches-list">tberman at off.net</A>&quot;&gt;me directly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+    &lt;h2&gt;Updating/Extension system&lt;/h2&gt;
+
+    &lt;p&gt;To prevent MD from turning into a hugely bloated pile of features that
+      no one uses, we need to create a system that allows extensions to be
+      installed with a minimum of fuss.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+    &lt;p&gt;My current thinking is that the MD core should be light, potentially
+      lighter than it is now. However, due to the way most people install MD
+      requiring installation into its prefix (generally /usr) would be
+      impossible to handle reliably. So, what we need to do, is allow
+      ~/.local/share/monodevelop/ to become an overridable mirror of
+      $prefix/lib/monodevelop/ (which should in reality move to
+      $prefix/share/monodevelop/). This will allow the gui to install/manage
+      extensions installed into that location. RPM packages of various
+      extensions would still be possible, as they would be installed
+      system-wide into $prefix/lib/monodevelop.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+    &lt;p&gt;General feature requirements of this system:
+      &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Installation of extensions, hopefully via the web w/ some
+	sort of web services/xml fetching system.&lt;/li&gt;
+      &lt;li&gt;Removal of extensions.&lt;/li&gt;
+      &lt;li&gt;Enabling/Disabling of various extensions without removal.&lt;/li&gt;
+      &lt;li&gt;Updating of extensions.&lt;/li&gt;
+      &lt;/ul&gt;
+    &lt;/p&gt;
+
+    &lt;p&gt;A couple potential potholes in implementing this:
+      &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;API changes between various versions of MonoDevelop. There will
+	have to be a way for the extensions to say 'I work on version 0.7 and
+	0.8'.&lt;/li&gt;
+      &lt;li&gt;Proper handling of updating, basically, when MonoDevelop 0.9 comes
+	out, do we enable extensions that arent certified to work with 0.9 and
+	take our chances, or do we disable functionality until someone marks
+	that extension as 'working'?&lt;/li&gt;
+      &lt;li&gt;Dependency resolution.&lt;/li&gt;
+      &lt;li&gt;It would be entirely possible for one
+	extension to conflict with another, and this needs to be avoided,
+	as it could break one, or both of the extensions. Having a variable
+	like 'importance' is not the way to go, as then you will end up
+	with every extension marked as the highest importance level
+	available.&lt;/li&gt;
+      &lt;/ul&gt;
+    &lt;/p&gt;
+
+    &lt;h2&gt;Keybinding System&lt;/h2&gt;
+
+    &lt;p&gt;Currently, we have hardcoded keybindings, like control+space to
+      trigger code completion, or F1 to do monodoc lookups. This needs to
+      be moved to a system that allows arbitrary keybindings to be assigned
+      to the keys.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+    &lt;p&gt;Looking at the gnome-control-center keybinding capplet for a UI
+      would be a good place to start, however also need a way for extensions
+      to install keybindings onto the system so they show up there.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+    &lt;h2&gt;Menu Extensibility&lt;/h2&gt;
+
+    &lt;p&gt;Our menu system is very extensible as it stands right now. However,
+      there are a few key places where more extensibility is needed. One
+      is in the right click menu on the text widget. This is an area that
+      sorely needs fixing for future text widget features.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+    &lt;p&gt;Another place that could be useful is customized menus. Right now
+      you can change the menu easily by editing the xml that represents
+      them. However, it would be nice to be able to do this via a gui.
+      Many people may disagree with allowing this sort of configurability, and
+      at times, I do as well, however it will allow people to work faster,
+      and that is the prime goal of the IDE. As well as disabling/enabling and
+      rearranging menu items, it would be nice if you could change the accel
+      the menuitem is attached to.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+    &lt;h2&gt;Code Templating Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
+
+    &lt;p&gt;Our code template system now is just no good. typing forp and having
+      it expand into a for loop just isnt as helpful as typing for and hitting
+      tab, and getting an expanded for loop, potentially even with more hinting
+      occuring. A system that allowed you to define variables that would be
+      expanded is the way to go. For example, a template defined as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+
+    &lt;div class=&quot;code-csharp&quot;&gt;
+for ($type$ $variable$ = 0; $variable$ &amp;lt; | ; $variable$++)&lt;br/&gt;
+{&lt;br/&gt;
+&lt;br/&gt;
+}&lt;/div&gt;
+
+    &lt;p&gt;Would allow you to hit tab and switch between the various variables, and
+      when you changed one instance, it would change them all. Note, this is just
+      an example off the top of my head, and the final syntax would be totally
+      different.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+    &lt;h2&gt;Code Completion&lt;/h2&gt;
+
+    &lt;h3&gt;Overloads&lt;/h3&gt;
+    
+    &lt;p&gt;Overloads need to be listed in the main dropdown, sequentially. So
+      for Console.WriteLine it should have:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+
+    &lt;div class=&quot;code-csharp&quot;&gt;
+WriteLine (int value)&lt;br/&gt;
+WriteLine (bool value)&lt;br/&gt;
+etc..&lt;/div&gt;
+
+    &lt;p&gt;This will allow for a lot greater flexibility, as well as allow the
+      different overloads (which could have different docs) to show up
+      properly without someone guessing.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+    &lt;h3&gt;Method Insight&lt;/h3&gt;
+
+    &lt;p&gt;When you enter the ( to start a method, it needs to id the method
+      you are working with, and display a parameter list as well as any
+      additional info it might have (docs, etc). In addition, if the method
+      has no overloads, or you just chose a specific overload in the previous
+      completion dialog, it should attempt to help you out, by displaying
+      a completion list with all the matching types. If you didn't pick
+      an overload from this list, it should show all types that match that
+      parameter from all the available overloads.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+    &lt;h3&gt;Additional completion targets&lt;/h3&gt;
+
+    &lt;p&gt;Here is a small list of additional places where code completion
+      isnt, and could be.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;override methods. When you type 'public override' you have just
+	limited your available potential entries, we should offer completion
+	data there.&lt;/li&gt;
+      &lt;li&gt;There are more, I'm just drawing a blank right now.&lt;/li&gt;
+    &lt;/ul&gt;
+
+    &lt;h2&gt;Debugger GUI&lt;/h2&gt;
+
+    &lt;p&gt;The debugger doesnt have nearly enough gui, at all. This needs to be
+      fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
+    
+  &lt;/body&gt;
+&lt;/html&gt;
