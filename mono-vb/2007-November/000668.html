vbnc: error &quot;Use the other overload.&quot;  Is there a AddressOf operator at
line 44 in your code?
 
It's fixed in the current code, and thus will be in the 1.2.6 release.
There's a workaround for the issue too; add an explicit creation of a
delegate.  Let us know how it goes...

Hi Tom,

 

This is obviously a compiler bug, but in order to find the cause I would
need to have a look at the code (feel free to send it to me directly,
there's no need to spend time isolating the issue further, I'll find it
in a couple of minutes anyway)

 

Rolf

Subject: [mono-vb] &quot;user the OTHER overload&quot;? (internal compiler error)

 

Greetings one and all - getting my feet wet here with mono, coming from
a modest vb6 background (and just learning .net), and as you might
expect I've hit a roadblock.

I have what I hope is a fairly simple application: a &quot;sign-in&quot; sheet for
LUG attendees [details below, for those that are interested]

Since I'm fairly comfortable with VB in general, I built this in the
&quot;express&quot; [free/beer] version of VB.net [2005] and got it running well
enough, copied the entire directory tree to my linux system, and
searched for what I expected to be the most frequent question people
like me would face: what next?  How do I &quot;compile&quot; this?  [my &quot;command
line&quot; compiling may date back to COBOL, but for VB I've never had to
touch the command line...]  Searching this archive did find a
&quot;suggestion&quot; of &quot;open the /solution/ in monodevelop and click the
run/start-debugging button&quot;

This resulted in an error about &quot;system.deployment&quot;, but further
research showed that this wasn't in use, so was safe to remove from the
project.  Now, when I compile I get the message:

    (44,99)(error: there has been an internal error in the compiler:
'Use the other overload.' caused by the line) 

And that's it -- no filename or line number reference for me to do any
further debugging... :( 

[oh, and I should point out I'm using the &quot;stock&quot; version of mono
included on the OpenSuSE 10.3 download] 

Tom 

Program details: 

This is based on something I remember from an OS/2 LUG that implemented
this in REXX.  The primary form has a text box to fill in your name, and
an &quot;OK&quot; button to mark yourself as &quot;in attendance&quot;.  There is a
[readonly] checked-listbox control with everyone's name, and pressing
&quot;OK&quot; searches the list and checks your name if found.  If not found,
exposes (makes visible) a frame with an &quot;e-mail&quot; textbox/prompt and a
second &quot;OK&quot; button -- pressing this button adds you to the list and
marks it as checked.  There is also an area on the form devoted to
information about the current meeting [who the speaker is, what the
topic is, etc.]  A second form, accessible by right-clicking the member
list, allows editing of user information [deleting duplicate names,
changing e-mail address]

Behind the scenes is a (disconnected?) &quot;dataset&quot; with tables for
attendees (LUG members), &quot;meeting information&quot;, and a cross-ref table of
meetings and attendees [who attended what meeting]  These are stored
(for the moment) as XML files in the user's home directory [loaded at
the start, saved when the program closes, lost if the program
crashes...]  Ultimately this will be replaced by direct access to a
mysql or similar database, but for now getting the program going is the
primary concern.
