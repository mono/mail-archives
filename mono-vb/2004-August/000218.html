It apparently has nothing to do with your patch. The test fails
in my work area as well and my work area doesn't have your
patch.

&gt;<i> confused as to what the current state of tests was and how
</I>&gt;<i> I could tell if I broke anything.
</I>
Under mcs/btests there is Readme that should provide some
information to go about. This is just a bare bone doc and we 
are exploring ways of running/reporting of test cases
better.

Currently there are number of test cases that break. One 
approach that you could take is run a 'make all' under mcs/btests
and save the results.out file and then diff this against the new  
results.out after yourchanges. 

This is the approach we take. Painful but that's the way it is now.

&gt;<i> I can check in the code without the tests but thought I'd
</I>&gt;<i> try and do both at once.
</I>
The right way to go.

So hope to see your patches and test cases soon.

Thanks a lot.

Regards,
Jambunathan K.

</I>There were a couple of reasons I hadn't checked this in yet.

Being a little busy was one but there were some technical
reasons too.

In order to check in tests I need to modify the test setup
so that there are some separate DLLs built as well as individual
EXEs and I hadn't got round to do that yet (my original tests
I did by hand).

Also I was trying to get the tests going as they were before
changing them and found that seem to fail compilation
for me (e.g. LongTypeCharTestA.vb) and was then a little
confused as to what the current state of tests was and how
I could tell if I broke anything. Can you explain the setup or
is it my setup is broken and this should compile?

I can check in the code without the tests but thought I'd
try and do both at once.

Bernie

</I>&gt;<i> We can integrate this patch in to cvs on behalf of you. But 
</I>&gt;<i> nevertheless if you could mail us your test cases we will be
</I>&gt;<i> reassured that the patch really works.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am sure you have test samples that you used for testing the
</I>&gt;<i> patch still lurking in your work area. Just grab it and mail across 
</I>&gt;<i> to us.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks once again for the patch.

</I>&gt;<i> Here's a refinement which also allows use of enums declared in other

</I>&gt;<i> (includes
</I>&gt;<i> the previous patch too).

</I>&gt;<i> [mono-vb] Patch for mbas for ByRef parameters from a DLLI attach a
</I>&gt;<i> patch so
</I>&gt;<i> that you can call methods in a referenced DLL that take
</I>&gt;<i> reference parameters and things compile. To do this I have made
</I>&gt;<i> ReflectionParameters return similar data to InternalParameters for
</I>&gt;<i> ByRef
</I>&gt;<i> parameters - and also use them when GetFullParameters doesn't return
</I>&gt;<i> anything (presumably currently you can't call a method with optional
</I>&gt;<i> parameters in a different DLL).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since I haven't done anything inside mbas before I may not have done
</I>&gt;<i> this in
</I>&gt;<i> the right way. But if it is OK I can commit this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Presumably a test case might be good but I am not quite sure where
</I>to
&gt;<i> add
</I>&gt;<i> this.
