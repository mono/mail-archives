<PRE>Hello,

    I have checked in a modified version of Jambunathan's work on bmcs
0.4 (I could not find the 0.5 like Jambu said).

    We took the changes that Jambu did from mcs to &quot;VBfy it&quot; and we
applied those to `gmcs' instead of basing it on `mcs'.  The reason for
this change was so that we eventually could get generics support into
our Basic compiler.  This is a long term goal, and we should not worry
too much about it, as there are plenty of other things that need to be
done.

    The `mbas' compiler is way more advanced, so we need to slowly
migrate the information to this branch (if people feel like this branch
is worth pursuing).

    Since the compiler might have to go into the class libraries one day
(am unclear about this at this point, but we believe it might), I think
it might be a good idea to request to everyone that code contributed to
bmcs be licensed under the MIT X11 license.  We will do the same for our
VB contributions, and later relicense the VB compiler under MIT X11 in
addition to the GPL.

Miguel.
