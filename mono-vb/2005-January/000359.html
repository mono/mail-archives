<PRE>Hi Kevin,

Well you can test our compiler and supportting library throwing vb.net
at them. We have a directory with small .vb test files, but we would
like to use real applications to gauge how far we are. In truth we now
are going to have two versions of the vb.net compiler: mbas the older
and more complete but little optimized version, and ? vmcs ? that is a
new effort that is forking frow a newer version of mcs (our c#
compiler) trying to gain all the improvements alreday done in mcs
since mbas stopped syncing with it.

Thanks for any help you can give us, if you don't like what I
suggested, get hold of a copy of mbas  C# source-code (svn: module mcs
directory mbas) and see if you feel confortable with that or any other
area.

Welcome,
