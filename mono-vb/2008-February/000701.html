<PRE>Hello all,

 

I recently started with mono. (I tried it a few years ago, but only console
applications did work fine)

As I understood from the documentation, it should be possible to run a
windows.forms application on
other platforms ?

I get my project compiled on my windows machine, but I can't get it to
compile/run on my MAC (tiger 10.4)

 

What I tried:

-          Fired up VS2003, created a module1.vb with a &quot;sub main&quot;, with a
simple msgbox(&quot;test&quot;)

-          I removed the &quot;imports system,system reflection and
system.runtime.interopservices&quot; 
from the assemblyinfo.vb

-          I only have system.data, system.drawing and system.windows.forms
as references

 

-          The application compiles and runs fine from with VS2003 (using
.NET framework 1.0)

-          I compiled it with vbnc on my windows machine, as following:
VBNC module1.VB
-r:system.data.dll,system.drawing.dll,system.windows.forms.dll
/target:winexe
/out:test.exe

-          The exe runs fine .

-          I then &quot;moved&quot; my whole folder to my MAC (tiger 10.4), where I
also installed mono.

-          I tried: mono test.exe, but I get all kinds of weird errors:
(system.overflowexception, Number overflow, at (wrapper managed-to-native)
System.object:__icall_wrapper_emul_fconv_to_ovf_i8 (double)
with some extra lines, all ending at [0x00000]

-          Then, I tried to compile it on my MAC, with:
VBNC module1.vb
-r:system.data.dll,system.drawing.dll,system.windows.forms.dll -out:test.exe

This gives me 3 warnings about class Mono.WebBrowser.DOM.Idocument could not
be loaded,
used in Mono.Mozilla, Version=0.2.0.0
(I don't see why I get this warnings, I don't use web-related things in my
test-application)

I also get an erro: VBNC99999: Unexpected error: the classed in the module
cannot be loaded,
at (wrapper managed-to-native) System.Reflection.Assembly:GetTypes (bool)

-          I also tried to use the libpath etc, but I still think that I'm
compiling against 2.0 instead of 1.0
on my MAC.

 

Can someone please help me out ? I have been trying to get this working on a
MAC for 3 full days now,
without any success. (also, MAC is relatively new to me, so I really need
some &quot;noob&quot; guidance)


Thanks in advance and sorry for my bad English (Dutch is my native language)
Best regards from Belgium,
Kris
