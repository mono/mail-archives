<PRE>Hey Guys,
I was looking after the bug # 59555 and trying to complete the
AddressOf grammar.
This is probably the Most wired vb statement I am trying implement in
my last 3 months vb compiler carrier.

As per vb the following program should work.

Imports System
Module M
	Delegate Sub SD()

	sub f()
		Console.WriteLine(&quot;hey&quot;)
	End sub

	sub SetDelegate(del as SD)	
		del.Invoke()
	end sub

	Sub Main()
		SetDelegate(AddressOf f)
	End Sub
End Module

Here &quot;AddressOf f&quot; statement in &quot;SetDelegate&quot; method should construct a
new Delegate and set it to the method.

Now for creating a delegate we need the Delegate type (SD in this case)
and the function name.

For getting the Delegate type we need to goto DoResolve of Invocation
class where the &quot;overloadResolve&quot; function would try to find out the
method it matches. Since I don't know the type of the delegate I could
not create a delegate till this point and hence not able to resolve the
overloaded method. And as long as I don't get the exact method it is not
possible to get the type of the delegate.

So, looks like I am in kind of a deadlock. 

Any suggestion or pointer or fresh air of thought would really help.

Regards.
Anirban.

ps : Normal way of creating a delegate is like this 

Delegate Sub SD()
dim d as SD
d = new SD (AddressOf f)
