<PRE>Hi Jochen,
This mail is regarding the bug (59555) filed by you yesterday.

&gt;<i> One of the problems reside in line 42  (&quot;Protected Overrides
</I>&gt;<i>Property 
</I>&gt;<i>AutoHandlers As Integer&quot;) and not in line 52 as shown in the &gt;compiler
</I>

When I try to compile your program in my machine it indicates the
problem exactly in line number 42 as per your expectation.
Below is the exception thrown in my machine.

[<A HREF="mailto:banirban@anirban">banirban@anirban</A> btests]$ mbas tryasp.vb
/r:Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll,System.dll,System.Web.dll,System.Data.dll  
 /target:library
--------
MonoBASIC: THIS IS STILL ALPHA AND UNSUPPORTED SOFTWARE, USE AT YOUR
OWN RISK.
--------
tryasp.vb(42,0) error BC30284: `ASP.index_aspx.AutoHandlers' no
suitable properties found to 'override
Compilation failed: 1 Error(s), 0 warnings

Just wondering how to reproduce the problem. Am I missing something.

I understand that the exception is not indicating the right line number
in either case. It should have indicated the line number 34. But right
now there are too many things to do which are much more higher in
priority. (But obviously if it shows line number 52 should be considered
as serious bug)


&gt;<i>  __ctrl.SetRenderMethodDelegate(AddressOf Me.__RenderTree)
</I>
All the syntaxes of AddressOf operator are not functioning as expected.
This syntax should be functional in next couple of days.

If you have a urgent requirement you can try the following syntax. The
outcome is exactly same in this case and this is working today :-). 
__ctrl.SetRenderMethodDelegate(New System.Web.UI.RenderMethod(AddressOf
Me.__RenderTree))

Please let me know if you have any further concern or query.

One small request. If you can break multiple problems as in this case
in sub problems and file a separate bug for each one would help us to
track them much easily.

Thanks.
Anirban.
