<PRE>Rob

I will commit your patches tomorrow.

As you know I am working on the FileSystem 
as  well. We are trying to squeeze in as much as
possible in to the 1.0 release so that more
people get to use of our classes and test them 
for us.

In your previous patch for FileOPen I realised 
that you have replaced Hashmap with an Array. 

I was wondering  that if we could adopt &quot;verbatim&quot; 
mainsoft's implementation (as long as we have 
reviewed them to be making sense) then we could 
be really really churning out code much faster.
(Btw, what do you guys say about this ? )

It was with this intention that I had already 
checked in the basic classes (VBFile, BaseVBFile, 
InputVBFile, OutPutVBFile )


Regards,
Jambunathan K.

</I>Hello,

Here's the implementation for FileLen and FileDateTime including unit
tests.

To Jambunathan: I think you meant by 'self-containing' patches that I
should
sent them as small as possible, so this is a patch with only two
methods.

Greetz,
-- Rob.
