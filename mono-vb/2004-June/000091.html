<PRE>Rob

I have committed your changes. 

I have done some reformatting to FileSystem.cs so that it 
looks more pleasant. Kindly submit your further patches 
on the newly committed FileSystem.cs.

While submitting your next patch make sure that you adhere 
strictly to the coding guidelines for if, else and switch 
blocks and that you break up lines that have more than 134
chars.

Submit patches promptly as and when it becomes self-contained, 
so that manageability becomes easier.

I haven't taken time off to critically review your patches,
instinctively I can say that they are good.

By submitting patches and that too with consistency (inspite 
of two weeks being too short a time to arrive at a conclusion)
you are gradually moving from a casual contributor to a serious 
mono-vb developer.

So some more patches &amp; enhancements ;-) , you will be on your way to
commit files directly to cvs.


Regards,
Jambunathan K.
