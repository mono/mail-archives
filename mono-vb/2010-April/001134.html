I'm pretty sure there is no &quot;VB.NET&quot; runtime, it's the same runtime
regardless of the .NET language.
You may be confused and meant the VB.NET *compiler* is implemented in C#, in
which case it wouldn't impact runtime performances or anything.

However, it's true that VB.NET is a second-class citizen in Mono (VB9 not
supported and all). C# gets all the spotlight.

Also, I think WinForms needs more love. Not because it is great or anything,
but for the sake of improved interoperability between .NET and Mono. Many
.NET apps use WinForms, and many developers know and use WinForms. In the
end, a better WinForms implementation would give a better image of Mono to
Windows users and developers.

</I>&gt;<i>  From my experiences, you should really use C# instead of VB.NET if you

</I>&gt;<i> The reason is, the VB.NET runtime is implemented in C#, and the C# 
</I>&gt;<i> runtime is implemented in C, as far as I have heard.
</I>&gt;<i> I've however never encountered problems with CType, CInt, CBool, CByte, 
</I>&gt;<i> CLng, Asc, Chr, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And also, VB.NET with mono is incomplete in many ways. Starting with no 
</I>&gt;<i> VB.NET compiler shipped with Mono for windows, to the vb.net runtime not 
</I>&gt;<i> deployed by default with mono, continuing with ASP.NET peculiarities 
</I>&gt;<i> like handling a button click only with ONCLICK instead of with the 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;handles&quot; clause, too.  Missing overloaded functions in the XMLwriter, 3 
</I>&gt;<i> missing GDI+ functions (like xWarpPath), etc.
</I>&gt;<i> And if you need a VB.NET function in C#, you can still include the VB 
</I>&gt;<i> runtime dll in your project.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, WinForms applications are always a bit tricky. They should work 
</I>&gt;<i> the same on every platform, but in reality, there are always some little 
</I>&gt;<i> differences (aka bugs) that can break a program.
</I>&gt;<i> The mono team has, in my opinion, achieved much, but as you have seen, 
</I>&gt;<i> it's yet far from perfect.
</I>&gt;<i> That's why you should do with .NET applications as you would do with any 
</I>&gt;<i> C++ application.
</I>&gt;<i> Use some cross-platform toolkit, like GTK (gtk# for .net, or wxWidgets 
</I>&gt;<i> for .NET).
</I>&gt;<i> It's no problem to design and compile GTK# applications with Visual 
</I>&gt;<i> Studio, and it's not really more difficult or more time-consuming than 
</I>&gt;<i> WinForms.
</I>&gt;<i> They are already much older than .NET and they are designed for 
</I>&gt;<i> cross-platform usage, and thus work much better than WinForms.

</I>&gt;<i> And yes, Linux is faster in most things than Windows, from 3d graphics, 
</I>&gt;<i> to file access and database handling, to search and network throughput, 
</I>&gt;<i> to memory fragmentation, and also in energy use.
</I>&gt;<i> However, many things are implementation specific, so there can be bugs 
</I>&gt;<i> in mono that make it look slower than .NET on windows, but on the other 
</I>&gt;<i> hand, sometimes there are also bugs in .NET that make mono look much
</I>&gt;<i> faster.
</I>&gt;<i> It depends a bit on what you do. Also, the bug you are experiencing can 
</I>&gt;<i> be a Virtualization issue. I've encountered more than one of those. You 
</I>&gt;<i> need to install Linux natively and test it by dualbooting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, if you used pictures in your program, keep in mind that Linux is 
</I>&gt;<i> case-sensitive, so Filename.png and filename.png are not the same, and 
</I>&gt;<i> it WILL result in error.
</I>&gt;<i> Another common issue is the directory separator (\ on windows, / on 
</I>&gt;<i> Linux, so use system.path.directoryseparatorchar).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another thing that you should be aware of is that if you use extensive 
</I>&gt;<i> graphics, there might be a problem with your graphics driver/GL hardware 
</I>&gt;<i> acceleration.
</I>&gt;<i> Usually, if you have Intel, it works without problems, but NVIDIA and 
</I>&gt;<i> ATI are the universial gravitation constant of bad driver quality, and 
</I>&gt;<i> that not just on Linux.
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2008/03/28/nvidia_vista_drivers/">http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2008/03/28/nvidia_vista_drivers/</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, if you have installed a default-installation of Suse, you have 
</I>&gt;<i> installed a KDE environment. KDE 4.x is known to be buggy, and the 
</I>&gt;<i> default window manager of most sane Linux systems is GNOME, and not KDE.
</I>&gt;<i> (For this issue, see some comments of Linus Torvals - a long-time 
</I>&gt;<i> extreme GNOME hater - which ditched KDE 4 for GNOME). It might have 
</I>&gt;<i> something to do with this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, if you are a first-time Linux user, do yourself a favour and 
</I>&gt;<i> install a popular Debian-based distribution, like Ubuntu. OpenSuse is a 
</I>&gt;<i> pain in the ass. Believe me, I know, I've used Debian since 1999, later 
</I>&gt;<i> Fedora, Ubuntu, Arch and lately I installed OpenSuse.
</I>&gt;<i> Believe me: None of them was as horrible as OpenSuse!.
