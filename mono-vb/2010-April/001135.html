PS: I'm on openSUSE, and like it very much. I've had fewer problems with it
than with Ubuntu (where I sometimes had graphics / sound driver issues,
depending on the computer). On top of that, openSUSE has a Mono version that
is up to date, no need to compile from sources to get the latest version or
anything (since both openSUSE and Mono come from Novell).

</I>&gt;<i> You may be confused and meant the VB.NET *compiler* is implemented in C#,
</I>&gt;<i> in which case it wouldn't impact runtime performances or anything.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, it's true that VB.NET is a second-class citizen in Mono (VB9 not
</I>&gt;<i> supported and all). C# gets all the spotlight.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I think WinForms needs more love. Not because it is great or
</I>&gt;<i> anything, but for the sake of improved interoperability between .NET and
</I>&gt;<i> Mono. Many .NET apps use WinForms, and many developers know and use
</I>&gt;<i> WinForms. In the end, a better WinForms implementation would give a better
</I>&gt;<i> image of Mono to Windows users and developers.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  From my experiences, you should really use C# instead of VB.NET if you 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> run mono applications under Linux.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The reason is, the VB.NET runtime is implemented in C#, and the C# 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> runtime is implemented in C, as far as I have heard.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've however never encountered problems with CType, CInt, CBool, CByte, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> CLng, Asc, Chr, etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And also, VB.NET with mono is incomplete in many ways. Starting with no 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> VB.NET compiler shipped with Mono for windows, to the vb.net runtime not 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deployed by default with mono, continuing with ASP.NET peculiarities 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like handling a button click only with ONCLICK instead of with the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;handles&quot; clause, too.  Missing overloaded functions in the XMLwriter, 3 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> missing GDI+ functions (like xWarpPath), etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And if you need a VB.NET function in C#, you can still include the VB 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> runtime dll in your project.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, WinForms applications are always a bit tricky. They should work 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the same on every platform, but in reality, there are always some little 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> differences (aka bugs) that can break a program.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The mono team has, in my opinion, achieved much, but as you have seen, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it's yet far from perfect.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's why you should do with .NET applications as you would do with any 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> C++ application.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Use some cross-platform toolkit, like GTK (gtk# for .net, or wxWidgets 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for .NET).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's no problem to design and compile GTK# applications with Visual 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Studio, and it's not really more difficult or more time-consuming than 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> WinForms.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> They are already much older than .NET and they are designed for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cross-platform usage, and thus work much better than WinForms.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://jrwren.wrenfam.com/blog/2008/11/01/gtk-in-visual-studio-2008-on-vista-x64/">http://jrwren.wrenfam.com/blog/2008/11/01/gtk-in-visual-studio-2008-on-vista-x64/</A>)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And yes, Linux is faster in most things than Windows, from 3d graphics, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to file access and database handling, to search and network throughput, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to memory fragmentation, and also in energy use.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, many things are implementation specific, so there can be bugs 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in mono that make it look slower than .NET on windows, but on the other 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hand, sometimes there are also bugs in .NET that make mono look much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> faster.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It depends a bit on what you do. Also, the bug you are experiencing can 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be a Virtualization issue. I've encountered more than one of those. You 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need to install Linux natively and test it by dualbooting.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, if you used pictures in your program, keep in mind that Linux is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> case-sensitive, so Filename.png and filename.png are not the same, and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it WILL result in error.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another common issue is the directory separator (\ on windows, / on 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Linux, so use system.path.directoryseparatorchar).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another thing that you should be aware of is that if you use extensive 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> graphics, there might be a problem with your graphics driver/GL hardware 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> acceleration.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Usually, if you have Intel, it works without problems, but NVIDIA and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ATI are the universial gravitation constant of bad driver quality, and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that not just on Linux.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2008/03/28/nvidia_vista_drivers/">http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2008/03/28/nvidia_vista_drivers/</A>)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, if you have installed a default-installation of Suse, you have 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> installed a KDE environment. KDE 4.x is known to be buggy, and the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> default window manager of most sane Linux systems is GNOME, and not KDE.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (For this issue, see some comments of Linus Torvals - a long-time 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extreme GNOME hater - which ditched KDE 4 for GNOME). It might have 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something to do with this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, if you are a first-time Linux user, do yourself a favour and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> install a popular Debian-based distribution, like Ubuntu. OpenSuse is a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pain in the ass. Believe me, I know, I've used Debian since 1999, later 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Fedora, Ubuntu, Arch and lately I installed OpenSuse.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Believe me: None of them was as horrible as OpenSuse!.
