&gt;<i> Have in mind that reporting errors back to us (either via 
</I>&gt;<i> bugzilla.novell.com or in this mailing list) is the best way to get these 
</I>&gt;<i> issues fixed eventually :) 
</I>You're right, I will do that.

&gt;<i> It's not really to be expected, but these things do happen. I think you
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> hit something that for some reason is faster in mono (maybe our
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of some of the base class libraries you use have been more
</I>&gt;<i> optimized, or you hit something in the jit we happen to generate better
</I>&gt;<i> code
</I>&gt;<i> for). It's hard to say without knowing exactly what is running faster in
</I>&gt;<i> your application. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And your sanity should be checked by tests confirming that mono gives the
</I>&gt;<i> same output as on windows :) If that is the case, you should have nothing
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> worry about. If not, please file bugs and we'll fix them. 
</I>I didn't even try the stress tests until after the unit tests were
successfully executed under mono and I was satisfied that everything was
running smoothly. From what you're saying, I guess I'll just chalk this up
as a significant mono improvement/optimization over some part of .Net and
not worry about it.
