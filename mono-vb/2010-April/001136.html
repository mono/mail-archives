Thanks for the reply with lots of information that I was unaware of. As
you've guessed, I'm a Linux novice and it shows. My choice of openSUSE was
dictated by the Mono version. Strangely, when I installed Ubuntu and then
downloaded Mono I got 2.2 (I think) but now I see that 2.4.2.3 is available
for 9.10. I will give that another go but I can't say I found openSUSE
difficult to use. I've changed the default shell to Gnome during
installation.

The minor problem I had doesn't seem to have anything to do with
virtualization and comes from the Mono XML library. I had to work around it
but it wasn't a big bother. Regarding gtk# I guess it might offer a good
alternative but I do very minimal GUI stuff and I'm not real keen on
introducing another dependency so I'll probably stick to plain Winforms for
now. Switching to C# is also not an option for me, at least for now - the
goal was to make the application run under Mono and since it was achieved I
don't see a compelling reason to switch to C#. The application in question
is a crypto simulator that isn't expected to support a large amount of
concurrent transactions anyway so I'm following a &quot;good-enough&quot; rule for
now.

Asc() and Chr() performed fine under Mono until they came across an 8-bit
character coming through the network from another machine. At that point I'm
guessing that the localization kicked in and they gave out incorrect
information. Switching to methods of the System.Text namespace solved this.

Again lots of thanks, I appreciate the time you took to respond.
