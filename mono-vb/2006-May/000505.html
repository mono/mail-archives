<PRE>Hello,

    Mr Rolf Bjarne Kvinge has applied for the Summer of Code, his
project listed is to complete a VB8 compiler written completely in VB.

    The compiler is not yet self-hosting, but there is a significant
amount of work there.   His compiler is targeting VB8 and am thinking it
might be a good idea to use this compiler instead of mbas and mbas2.

    We are likely going to fund this effort through the Summer of Code,
and maybe it would make more sense to work with him on this.

    To check out his compiler, see:

	<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/vbnc">http://sourceforge.net/projects/vbnc</A>

    I know that we have received an email from Jelmer to work on mbas,
and am wondering if Rolf thinks that he could use some help in a
particular area of his compiler  that he could delegate to Jelmer.

Miguel.
</PRE>
