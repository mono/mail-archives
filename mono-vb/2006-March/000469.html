<PRE>I'm currently in the planning stages for an application written in
Visual Basic .NET. This application will be used primarily on the
Windows operating system, at least initially, but I want to support
use of the application on Linux.

I am developing the application for Windows in SharpDevelop. I have a
Debian Linux system set-up, and I will be using it to do some of the
development and testing of the application on Mono. (I'm still a
relative nebie to Linux.) My goal is a single cross-platform
application.

I had contacted the MonoGIS mailing list about my application, and
they mentioned C# might be a better programming language than .NET.
This wouldn't be a problem normally, except that my application is
geared towards developers that are already familiar with Visual Basic
.NET and are coming from a legacy Visual Basic background. I was
hoping to capture a large developer audience for my application and I
fear I will loose many of them if I use C# instead of Visual Basic
.NET.

What type of support will I find for Visual Basic .NET in Mono? What
type of future will the language have on the Mono platform?

If I do decide Visual Basic .NET is a viable language for development
on Mono, how can I help make sure it remains a viable language? I can
probably contribute to documentation efforts, and wouldn't mind
learning about the Visual Basic compiler for Mono. I have some
experience with other high and low level languages, so I'm sure I
could pick it up with time.

Thanks very much for the advice.

Scott Huey

P.S. - The first public release of the application won't be for at
least 6 to 12 months, so I have some time for support of Visual Basic
.NET in Mono to improve.
