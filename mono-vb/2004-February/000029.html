Oh i see, thanks for the pointer. Is this mainly used on Linux or 
something? I've never heard of it in the Windows environment.

I think your idea of &quot;clean-while-you-write&quot; is a good way to go since 
it allows us to continue new development on mbas but still eventually 
get the code to a cleaner state.

When I last checked, fixing some of the sharp'isms was just a case of 
deleting code. Though straighforward, I am worried that this could 
require cascade-deletes (eg we remove a sharp'ism, then mbas stops 
compiling because another sharp'ism we havent removed was relying on the 
one we just removed. So we remove that second sharp'ism too and the 
process repeats)

Its a tricky situation. On the one hand mbas exists at all because it 
borrows from mcs. On the other hand, the manageable existence of mbas 
code is made difficult *because* its borrows from mcs. Hmmm, I wonder if 
it would be easier to use a paste-code-in process instead of 
cut-code-out process. The paste-code-in process would consist of 
starting afresh, then pasting in small parts of mcs that are needed for 
mbas, until we get back to where we are. The cut-code-out process (the 
one we seem to be heading for) would consist of starting with mcs, then 
removing parts out of it until we have only whats needed for mbas.

Any ideas?
