Hi Rafael :)

Interesting. How far are we with the original C# implementation?

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
That sounds good. Having to deal with the different modes of operation 
in VB.NET is a bit of pain for writing compilers, but thats what hacking 
is all about so it should be fun :)

Is there any chance that parts of the compiler/supporting libraries 
could be done in VB.NET? My fingers are itching to write code :)

Cheers,
Eric.
