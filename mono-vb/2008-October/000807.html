<PRE>Hi,

 

Regarding vbnc there is no important difference from MS' vb compiler (vbc),
they generate just the same assemblies (modulo bugs in vbnc), so there's not
much than can be done there.

 

What might be possible is to take Mono's Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll
implementation and install it with the application on the xbox.

 

 It would work just as any other assembly in your project, you can even
continue to use VS/XNA toolkit.

 

The only problem (with using VS) is that VS doesn't allow you to deselect
the GAC'ed Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll, meaning that you'd probably have to
develop with VS on a desktop with MS' Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll, and when
you execute on the xbox you'd be using Mono's Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll. 

 

You might also have to change a few minor pinvokes (which I suppose won't be
equivalent on the xbox), but Mono's Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll contains very
few pinvokes so that shouldn't be a big problem.

 

Rolf

Subject: [mono-vb] Mono-vb on XBox 360?

 


Using Microsoft's XNA toolkit, you can create games for Windows and the XBox
360 using C#.

If you use it to create a game using VB.NET, it will run on Windows, but not
on the XBox 360 because the XBox 360 only has the compact framework, and MS
VB.NET makes calls to the .NET Framework that are not included in the
compact edition.

 

Any clue if VBNC executables will run on the XBox?

Or if a version of it could be made that would (VBXNA?)?

 

There are a lot of people out there that really want to use VB to develop
games for the XBox, and if we could arrange for that to happen, it might
generate some really good PR.

 

I would be willing to help with such a project, but would probably need a
lot of help from someone who has experience with VBNC.

 

I know at some point there was a MonoXNA project, but I think that died??

MonoXNA also involved installing Mono on the XBox which a lot of people
would not want to do, and might run into copyright issues.

 

This came to me as I was reading a book on XNA game programming, and is a
vague concept/idea, so I am open to all comments, suggestions, and ideas.

 

Thanks,

Dennis
