I'm new to VB8 myself and even newer to Mono but from what I understand I
think it can be done this way. Sounds like you wrote the program. You can
upgrade it to VB8 with your source and then it should work in Mono. I
upgraded a VB6 program myself that I had just started, wasn't much to it at
all yet, and it took some serious time, being new to VB8 and all. It will do
some of the work for you, and tell you hints on what it can't fix, so you
know what else to fix. But if it's much of a program at all, your in for
quite a task. I know it's daunting, but I think it can be done. I got on a
VB8 board to get help on what I couldn't figure.
