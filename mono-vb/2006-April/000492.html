<PRE>To add to this:

The tests for VB.NET compiler regression is neither coherent nor complete.
It is only limitedly useful.

I had bunch of VB.NET files that I was targetting to compile (or not compile
successfully as the case may be) when I had worked on Expressions support in
bmcs. This was fairly comprehensive to cover a broad spectrum of scenarios.
For whatever reasons, I haven't gotten these in to svn and my workspace is
lost.

The compiler regression script written in perl may be used for automated
regression for the future implementation.

Regards,
Jambunathan K.

</I>&gt;<i> ago) and implement VB that way.  Lets call this effort &quot;mbas2&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Emotionally this appeals to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The following items favor this proposal:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. VB.NET is not &quot;standardized&quot;. This is to our advantage for we can scope
</I>&gt;<i> and define what mono's VB.NET will or will not support.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  We can leave out certain constructs like supporting error numbers or
</I>&gt;<i> mapping error numbers to exceptions. Going down to the last detail as in
</I>&gt;<i> retaining error numbers across vbc and mbas2 would be seriously detrimental
</I>&gt;<i> to progress and should be avoided at all costs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In short,  the implementation should be in spirit rather than in true
</I>&gt;<i> literal sense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. We build on an existing infrastructure that is rock solid and
</I>&gt;<i> equivalent if not better in power. Yet we are starting from scratch in that
</I>&gt;<i> all C# compiler constructs will be passed through a &quot;VB.NET&quot; filter and
</I>&gt;<i> refactored.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In short we would be standing on giant's shoulders.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. If we decide to go down this path, we need to go with surgical
</I>&gt;<i> precision starting from expressions and working all the way up to higher
</I>&gt;<i> semantic units like delegates. (This in my IMHO is where mbas had seriously
</I>&gt;<i> failed.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In short it is a marathon and so it should be treated. Any desire for
</I>&gt;<i> quick results would be against the rules of the game.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. gmcs and mbas2 trees should be twins till such time as mbas2 relies on
</I>&gt;<i> gmcs for borrowing major features. If gmcs is reasonably mature this would
</I>&gt;<i> neither be a big overhead nor a major challenge.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All 1-4 were the philosophy behind bmcs as it started as a fork of  gmcs.
</I>&gt;<i> I stuck to these principles for close to 3 months when I was comitting
</I>&gt;<i> bottomline patches to the bmcs tree. This is refelected in the ChangeLogs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     The idea would be to go in chunks: we could integrate individual
</I>&gt;<i> commits that were done to the old mbas tree, and determine one by one
</I>&gt;<i> whether it applies to mbas2.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Miguel as someone who has worked on mbas and who has personally worked and
</I>&gt;<i> intreacted with Anirban (the then mbas owner) I can say with certainty that
</I>&gt;<i> this would be an exercise that would not only be time consuming but would
</I>&gt;<i> also be of little value add.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even if we decide to go down this path, we would miss nothing if we
</I>&gt;<i> restrict the patches to those that were committed before Anirban took over.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Neither am I a C# or VB.NET programmer (in the remotest sense) nor am I am
</I>&gt;<i> compiler guru. I am making these observations as a practitioner and as
</I>&gt;<i> someone who spared some sincere love over mbas/bmcs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Jambunathan K.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hey,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Yesterday I met with Rafael and we discussed a bit what we wanted to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do with Mono's VB compiler.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     The situation is that today's VB compiler is based on a fork of mcs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; circa 2002.  And although some of the improvements to mcs made it into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mbas, they were not all incorporated.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     To make things worse, the new VB.NET supports generics.   So we are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wondering whether it would not be a better idea to start a fresh fork
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from gmcs (along the same proposal that Jambunathan had a year or so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ago) and implement VB that way.  Lets call this effort &quot;mbas2&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     The idea would be to go in chunks: we could integrate individual
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; commits that were done to the old mbas tree, and determine one by one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whether it applies to mbas2.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Maybe not all of the code can be salvaged, but if we can get even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 40% of the old code migrated into the new tree it would be a big plus.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Now, this might be insane, because once I was talking to someone on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the VB.NET team and when I told them how mbas was written he said &quot;I did
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not think that VB.NET could be implemented that way&quot;.   Maybe our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; approach is completely busted, but I do not know enough about VB.NET to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; know.  I just know that if the original mbas idea made sense, we should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; probably start from scratch.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Now, since we are already too close to 1.2, we should probably
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; develop this on a separate tree, to avoid breaking the build of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;mono/mcs&quot;, so it should be another top level module in the Mono
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; repository.  And we should probably also kill &quot;mcs/bmcs&quot; (at least we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could retrieve the few patches that were done there).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Miguel.
