</I>I think I might want to move mbas, mbas2, bmcs and the VisualStudio
runtime *out* of mcs and not distribute it as part of mono/mcs until
they are ready.   The runtime in particular is missing enough pieces
(from 2.0, but the issue comes up frequently) that I much rather just
state that we do not support VB.NEt for the time being.
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>
Sounds like a very practical idea to me.

I no longer maintain bmcs.

If you think the idea has some future, it is preferable that it is made
available in a well known and accessible attic or made open for Google's
SoC.

Jambunathan K.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  We can leave out certain constructs like supporting error numbers or

</I>&gt;<i> That sounds fine.
