</I>I'm not convinced mbas should be a fork of mcs. 

Having it that way might make things more complicated then they have to
be. I'm not sure how much of the current code comes from mcs, but it
would make sense to just make mbas parse VB.NET code and then generate
the appropriate datastructures for the classes in gmcs. For example, I
don't think mbas should contain a 'Statement' class but should rather
use the one from gmcs directly (rather then import it). That should also
allow sharing of optimalizations. 

&gt;<i>     Now, since we are already too close to 1.2, we should probably
</I>&gt;<i> develop this on a separate tree, to avoid breaking the build of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;mono/mcs&quot;, so it should be another top level module in the Mono
</I>&gt;<i> repository.  And we should probably also kill &quot;mcs/bmcs&quot; (at least we
</I>&gt;<i> could retrieve the few patches that were done there).
</I>Makes sense.

On a related matter - would you accept mbas-related proposals for SoC to
work on &quot;mbas2&quot;?

Cheers,

Jelmer
