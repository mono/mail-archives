<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> 1. VB.NET is not &quot;standardized&quot;. This is to our advantage for we can
</I>&gt;<i> scope and define what mono's VB.NET will or will not support.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  We can leave out certain constructs like supporting error numbers or
</I>&gt;<i> mapping error numbers to exceptions. Going down to the last detail as
</I>&gt;<i> in retaining error numbers across vbc and mbas2 would be seriously
</I>&gt;<i> detrimental to progress and should be avoided at all costs. 
</I>
The error codes are not standardized in C# either, they were just a
useful thing to have.   Sure, its some extra work, but it helps finding
potential probelms.

&gt;<i> Even if we decide to go down this path, we would miss nothing if we
</I>&gt;<i> restrict the patches to those that were committed before Anirban took
</I>&gt;<i> over.
</I>
That sounds fine.

&gt;<i> Neither am I a C# or VB.NET programmer (in the remotest sense) nor am
</I>&gt;<i> I am compiler guru. I am making these observations as a practitioner
</I>&gt;<i> and as someone who spared some sincere love over mbas/bmcs.
</I>
I do have another concern though;   Today folks are reporting that VB
does not work (and in a sense that is correct, we do not even have full
runtime support).

I think I might want to move mbas, mbas2, bmcs and the VisualStudio
runtime *out* of mcs and not distribute it as part of mono/mcs until
they are ready.   The runtime in particular is missing enough pieces
(from 2.0, but the issue comes up frequently) that I much rather just
state that we do not support VB.NEt for the time being.

Miguel.
</PRE>
