Firstly Thanks to all for the posts I understand a lot more now. However its
still very complex for my overworked mind at the moment. I look forward to
the WinForms Designer, think this may be the answer for us as long as we can
use it with VB code not just C#. 

As time goes on im sure that the MONO project will fit my needs, so its just
a matter of waiting. 

In the meantime, as I want to move all our systems over to Linux for our
nice new offices (which will be ready for moving into in a couple of months)
I have come up with a solution to allow this.

I am going to convert our CRM system to ASP.NET it started life as a web
based app anyway so a lot of core code is there. This will mean I can host
it on a XP box but have everything else Linux ie Desktops etc. 

I intend to write a quick and dirty app to take my Form designs and create
basic web page controls, it wont be a full convertion app but if anyone
wants a copy let me know and I can post the code somewhere.

As a personal note I know that perhaps VB is not seen as a great Language
but there are a lot of apps out there using it. If Mono can one day crack
this and make  a nice GUI for VB developers then I think the move to Linux
might pick up pace.
