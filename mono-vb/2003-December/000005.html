</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The VsaEngine, which comes from &quot;Visual Studio for Applications&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> is the mechanism that offer scripting capabilities to .Net (although it existed before .Net too).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> They way VSA works is:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) We have a host, our application. The host implements a interface, IVsaSite.
</I>
Is it a .NET or a COM Interface? If it is COM, we would have to make the
wrapping and all the COM Interop things that are nearly meaningless in
Linux...

&gt;<i> 2) We have scriting execution machine (the VsaEngine), which implements the interface IVsaEngine.  
</I>
Same question.

&gt;<i> and communication is passed through the methods implementations from those interfaces.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And basically what the VsaEngine does is, take a source file or an assembly and compiles/execute it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From what I've been able to see that the JScript VsaEngine does is: taking care of the 
</I>&gt;<i> runtime supprt for assemblies generated by jsc. Basically, takes care of the global 
</I>&gt;<i> environment (types, functions, prototypes which are available) and the differents environments created 
</I>&gt;<i> on the course of the program execution. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The code used for IVsaSite and IVsaEngine, is not difficult, I already have some 
</I>&gt;<i> chunks written at mcs/class/Microsoft.JScript/Microsoft.JScript/Vsa*.cs
</I>&gt;<i> but the one for environments, is a little strange, also I have not found docs.
</I>
These itens are documented only for partners of M$ that already paid
lots of money for the right to make things that can be embedded in
Office/VisualStudio. NDAs apply.

&gt;<i> I think lot's of code can be shared in this one, and also some discussion will help us understand
</I>&gt;<i> this thing.
</I>
Surely, all but some language-specific bits can be factored into some
common classes.
