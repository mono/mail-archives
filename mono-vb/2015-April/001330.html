<PRE>Greetings All,

I hope that you are doing well.

I'm a bit new to Mono-VB but am interested in compiling up the mono VB.NET
compiler to get a feel for the sources and play a bit with it on my windows
machine.

Given that, can someone please give me an idea as to what sources need to
be downloaded from the Mono-GitHub?

I found the older mono/mono-basic stuff but could not locate the new
implementation that is supposed to be for VB.Net.

Also, in my reading on the Mono website, it says that the Mono basic
(VB.Net) implementation was compiled with VB.Net and I was wondering if the
Mono basic (VB.Net) implementation could be compiled with the latest
pre-compiled Mono basic application?

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Kind Regards and have a great day,
Lonnie
