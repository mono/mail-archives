Good to know that you have been experimenting with MSVB namespace.

&gt;<i> The Microsoft.VisualBasic namespace has some errors with the newline=20
</I>&gt;<i> constants that have been there for quite some time.=20
</I>
I have fixed the definitions. You should be able to pull the changes from =
cvs
right now.=20

Btw, a good catch ...

&gt;<i> Furthermore, it seems like there are bugs in the InputVBFile and=20
</I>&gt;<i> BinaryVBFile because they check for only carriage returns to find the =
</I>end of=20
&gt;<i> the line. This approach will not work in Unix, and is only partly =
</I>correct in=20
&gt;<i> Windows.=20
</I>
The MSVBFilesystem was squeezed in at the literally the last minute before =
the tree
was frozen for 1.0 release. So expect to see issues with current builds, =
but all=20
this will be addressed with the 1.2 release. mbas and MSVB namespace will =
have=20
mainstream ready by then.

If you encounter any nagging issues please raise them in the forum and =
rest assured
that it will be addressed at the earliest. Better still open bugs in =
Bugzilla and
it will never get lost in the noise in the discussion lists. Make sure =
that you
add a test case to reproduce the bug you are seeing.

</I>(I previously sent a similar message, but I wasn't subscribed from this=20
account, and the administrator hasn't yet approved it)

The Microsoft.VisualBasic namespace has some errors with the newline=20
constants that have been there for quite some time. I have finally =
grown=20
tired of seeing them and have written a small patch to fix them.

Furthermore, it seems like there are bugs in the InputVBFile and=20
BinaryVBFile because they check for only carriage returns to find the end =
of=20
the line. This approach will not work in Unix, and is only partly correct =
in=20
Windows. It also seems to me that the choice of vbCrLf to mean &quot;\r\n&quot; =
is=20
unwise on most platforms.

I'd like any comments on how this should be handled, and I'd be happy =
to=20
write any patches to fix it.
