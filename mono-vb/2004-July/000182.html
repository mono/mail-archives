<PRE>Joao

Good to have you onboard.

Allow me to own the pre-processor stuff as I am likely to
be done with it in another couple of days.

As for test cases, one other alternative to what Rafael,=20
suggested is to  translate mcs test cases to vb test cases=20
with an eye for any vb nuances.

You can also look at the defects that are open in bugzilla.=20
Once you start working on one of those defects it wouldn't=20
be diffcult to charter your own course through the next=20
series of defects/enhancements.

Fyi, most of the mbas implementations could be borrowed from
the equivalent mcs implementations with some tweaks here
and there. But there are exceptions.

Jambunathan K.

</I>Hi, Everyone

=20

My name is Jo=E3o Paulo Viegas Carneiro,

I'm a Brazilian programmer and I'm happy

to announce that I will be working for the MonoBasic project

as much as I can.

I've been talking to Rafael and he told me that a good beginner

trial is to write as many test as possible*so I want to know if is there
anyone writing test to the compiler?

If the answer is yes, please let me know how can I help.

Otherwise, I will start with the preprocessor directives.

=20

Best regards,

Jo=E3o.
