<PRE>Hi Paulo,

Welcome to the mbas community.

As Rafael mentioned I have written many test cases to check completeness =
of the functionality of various Types and Type Members in VB and added =
them btests folder under mcs.

You are welcome to start working with preprocessor directives. In this =
case I feel you need to work closely with Jambu as he is already working =
with preprocessor directives.

Also there are other things on which no one is working currently.
Like we need to test throughly each and every Statement and Expression =
mentioned in VB .net Spec ( <A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?u=">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?u=</A>
rl=3D/library/en-us/vbls7/html/vblrfvbspec6_2.asp )

Please feel free to chose your area and start adding test cases.

Thanks &amp; regards.
Anirban.

</I>Hi, Everyone

=20

My name is Jo=E3o Paulo Viegas Carneiro,

I'm a Brazilian programmer and I'm happy

to announce that I will be working for the MonoBasic project

as much as I can.

I've been talking to Rafael and he told me that a good beginner

trial is to write as many test as possible*so I want to know if is there
anyone writing test to the compiler?

If the answer is yes, please let me know how can I help.

Otherwise, I will start with the preprocessor directives.

Best regards,

Jo=E3o.
