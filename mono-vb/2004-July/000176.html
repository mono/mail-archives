<PRE>(reposted)

Well the only thing, if at all, that has surfaced till now is
the inability of C# to convey the default arguments for
the optional parameters. 

I am personally with Ryan and for now, my efforts are with Anirban,
Rafael, Jochen and others to entirely getting mbas to production 
ready state.

Raja earlier had a solution for introducing custom attribs that the
mcs and clr can understand. 

The biggest question that we need to ask ourselves is whether 
we need to at all at some point in time cater to cross compiling 
our MS.VB runtime libraries with csc or any other standard C# 
compiler and actually use those compiled dlls to link against our 
programs. Do you think that the later  scenario is likely ? 
Personally I know of no such scenarios.

I think we would be better off working around with what we already
have. We wouldn't be any worse but all the more better for lots of 
saved effort.

Jambunathan K.

</I>Dennis,

&gt;<i>From the conversations we've been having on the VB mailing list, it
</I>seems that the VB compiler (mbas) isn't up to compiling class
assemblies
just yet.  Microsoft did in fact write the VB namespace in VB.NET, and
uses aspects of the VB.NET language that aren't available in C#.  So,
in
order for mono to have a complete implementation of the base class,
we're either going to have to change how the C# language works
slightly,
write parts of the namespace in MSIL, or convert everything over and
use
the VB compiler when it matures.

 

However, right now it's my opinion that we should wait for the
compiler
to get to a point where it's usable for compiling class libraries,
then
start porting over the VB namespace to VB.  This will help in testing
the compiler as well as get the namespace in the right language.  Of
course, this is just my opinion, and I'd like to hear what some of the
big guys have to say about it.

 

When/if work starts on the VB namespace in VB, I'm more than ready to
jump in and start implementing/converting parts of it.

 

Ryan

Subject: [Mono-devel-list] VB.NET runtime

 

Currently our VB runtime is written in C#.

I have heard rumer that MS implments Microsoft.VisualBasic in VB, and
that due to differences in the languages, we will need to convert this
namespace to VB for complete compatablity.

Is this correct?
I am about to test some tools that convert between VB and C#, should I
add a MS.VB.VB to CVS and start converting the code?

Is this needed or useful?
Dennis
