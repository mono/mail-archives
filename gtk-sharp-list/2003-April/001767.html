Frankly, I don't know that there are &quot;a lot of things that *must* be
changed now.&quot;  We have been doing a good job of evolving the binding. 
The things that are getting changed lately are problems in the API that
have been exposed by the inspection of the documentation team.

There are indeed things that can still be done to make the binding feel
more .Net-like, but they don't necessarily have to be done in a manner
that breaks existing code.

That said, the API is not stable. No schedule has been proposed or
announced as to when it will be stable.  We are not going to haphazardly
go around screwing the early adopters who are helping us make the
binding better, but we are also not going to freeze the API until it is
ready.

Mike
