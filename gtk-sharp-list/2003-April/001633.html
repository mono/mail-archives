<PRE>One thing I've noticed is there seems to be problems with Pixbuf under
.NET. There error says:
Unhandled exception in gdk-sharp.dll
Unable to load gdk_pixbuf-2.0

this is strange 'cause the libgdk_pixbuf-2.0.dll is in the lib directory
and other lib* seem to be loading find with other things.

My goal is to use GTK# under windows with .NET for an application we are
developing. The reason is we believe that this toolkit is the future of
cross-platform development.
