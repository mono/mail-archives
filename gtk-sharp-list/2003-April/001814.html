<PRE>I wouldn't spend any more time on this, really.  I have a script that I
use to produce release tarballs, and it's a bit more complex than a
distclean/tar.  That will ship a bunch of cvs crap in the tarball too,
for example.

Anyway, there's only one person who would be interested in this
capability, the maintainer.  I've got a method that I'm comfortable with
already, although I appreciate your effort to make my life easier.  :)
Normally the most complex part of the release process is going through
and fixing all the win32 breakage that has crept in since the last
release.

As far as the rpm targets, that's beyond the scope of a makefile, IMO.
Anyone who wants to build a binary distribution of Gtk# likely already
has their own tools to do it.

Regards,
Mike
