What I have been trying to do so far, is to include just 1 or 2 example
*methods* inline, and then reference a complete C# file as well.

As I see it, this has a bunch of benefits:

1) The user gets to see a short, simple example *immediately* in the
class overview.
2) The user gets to see the example methods in the context of a complete
program, albeit a simple one.
3) The user also gets a complete example they can copy, compile etc.
4) We can easily add extra examples as complete .cs files without
cluttering up the class overview page.

[By user here, I mean the person reading the docs]

&gt;<i> Also, 
</I>&gt;<i> % ls gtk-sharp/doc/en/Gtk/*.cs
</I>&gt;<i> gtk-sharp/doc/en/Gtk/Viewport1.cs
</I>
As you can see, I have only added one complete example so far. There is a lot of work to be done on this. 
Alejandro Sánchez Acosta is also creating examples in monkeyguide/samples/tutorial, which we can copy, and contribute to.

In short, I think class overviews should have 1 or 2 methods as an example, and we should create a 'samples' directory in each assembly's API doc directory, eg. doc/en/Gtk/samples

Does this sound sane to people?

At the moment, I don't think it's a critical priority because (last time I checked) the doc browser doesn't have any way to display/link complete examples.
But it will soon I'm sure. :)

Regards,

Lee.
