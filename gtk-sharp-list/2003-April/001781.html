Don't feel bad - constructive API criticism is a good thing imho!

While not much help to you in the short term, I would agree that the
learning curve for treeviews is high. There is plenty that can be done
to help that, including simplifying/improving the API, as well as the
documentation.

However, speaking personally, I have too many other tasks to do before
being able to hack much on the Gtk# treeview.

If you (or anyone else) has chance to come up with a set of proposals for improving the API though, that might make gtk# hackers more likely to implement the needed changes.
The Gtk# Wiki already has a few thoughts on the treeview IIRC.

Regards,

Lee.
