No, I think generating the source file directly is fine in this case. 
It sounds like this &quot;type&quot; is going to end up being substantially hacked
from the current automagically generated base.  That being the case, we
probably don't even need to keep the script around once the manual
hacking starts. 

&gt;<i> Alternatively, since we do have the problem that any automated script

We have several CLS-compliance issues to address.  IntPtr and unsigned
API, this case-sensitivity stuff, etc...  This is clearly an important
goal, and we should mark this type with a bug report to indicate it has
CLS issues.

&gt;<i> But anyways, as I mentioned in a previous e-mail, I suggest something
</I>&gt;<i> like this...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     public struct Key
</I>
This seems a little heavy to me.  The currently encouraged method of
handling Text input in Gtk.IMContext.  I think having an enum that is
CLS-compliant to expose gdk keycodes is a good goal, though.
