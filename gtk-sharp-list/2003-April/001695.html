<PRE>Hello,

   MonoDoc 0.4 has been released.  This includes documentation for the
core ECMA functionality as well as Gtk#.  

   Everyone should thank Lee Mallabone his countless hours acting as an
editor, reviewer and documentor for the Gtk# API.  

   News on this release:

	* History works.
	* More links work.
	* Multi-homed sources work.
	* Command Line tool (type: mod T:System.Char for example).
	* Improved GUI look.
	* The tree now tracks the page.

   He has done a fantastic job and has taken very good care of the
documentation, making sure that samples are included, that the
documentation looks pretty, double checking that things link, and
on top of that helping new people get used to Gtk# and Mono.  

   The contributors to this release were:

	Duncan Make, Eduardo García, Hector Gomez, Kevin Breit, Lee
	Mallabone, Jaime Anguiano, Miguel de Icaza, and Raphael
	J. Schmid. 

   Availability:

	<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/monodoc-0.4.tar.gz">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/monodoc-0.4.tar.gz</A>

   This version is a source code only release, and requires the latest
Gtk# from CVS, it will not work with the released version of CVS.

   News on this release:

	* History works.
	* More links work.
	* Multi-homed sources work.
	* Command Line tool (type: mod T:System.Char for example).
	* Improved GUI look.
	* The tree now tracks the page.

Enjoy,   
Miguel.
