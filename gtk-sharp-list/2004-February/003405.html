<PRE>Thanks Jon and Shantanu - I managed to get gtk on and the application now
seems to find everything.

It doesn't do anything and thats because I based the starting thread code on
what I know of ms.net and so I'm guessing it's
different.

How did you guys learn this ? The docs are well non existant as far as do
you use glade or something else or art? Maybe it will help if I tell you I
want to develop a gui that doesn't conform to any present standards but must
run inside gnome.

thanks a lot

</I>&gt;<i> even if Mono had one).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure when this will be fixed (hopefully before Mono's GAC is

</I>&gt;<i> they're private assemblies, and thus *must* be in the same directory as
</I>&gt;<i> the executable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;snip/&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have gtk# installed but I can't get it to work. Seems it wants some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gtk+ files and even though I have the dll's it can't use them, hell I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; even register them using regsvr32.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> `regsvr32' is used to register COM DLLs (DLLs with a DllRegisterServer()
</I>&gt;<i> export, among others), which doesn't describe GTK+ or Gtk#.  So it's
</I>&gt;<i> perfectly sensible that regsvr32 wouldn't do anything. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've read all the docs I could find, I've search google and the lack
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of material on exactly how to go about using gtk# is a little
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; worrying! Is this project well supported and is development moving
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; forward? I tried looking at the gtk+ website and I'm not sure what the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hell I'm looking at.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Gtk# is a managed wrapper over GTK+.  Thus, you need GTK+ installed and
</I>&gt;<i> working, and the GTK+ libraries either need to be (1) in the same
</I>&gt;<i> directory as your application, or (2) in the PATH, or (3) installed in a
</I>&gt;<i> well-known location, like %WINDIR%\system32.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's been awhile since I've done anything with Windows, though, so
</I>&gt;<i> hopefully someone else can elaborate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can find a GTK+ for Windows install here, as part of the Gimp:

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/downloads.html">http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/downloads.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - Jon
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't want to compile gtk+ on my machine because I need a deployment
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; path for this new application.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Many of you work very hard towards mono and a free net but there must
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be an easier path for x-windows developers to follow otherwise all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; your newbies are going to stay away.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thanks - sorry for the rant ;)
