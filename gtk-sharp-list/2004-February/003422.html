This is already in the FAQ, but just because the convention in C
programming is to pierce encapsulation and change object behavior
without subclassing doesn't mean that a C# binding should do it.

No, subclassing and overriding the default handler does *not* use
g_signal_connect at all.  It uses the more object-oriented approach of
overriding the object's &quot;protected&quot; default handler to change the
object's behavior.

Your example doesn't work because it has a bug.  You need to use
RegisterGType to register your subclass with the native type system.
RegisterGType automagically hooks up all overridden default handlers.
Take a look at sample/Subclass.cs for an example usage of
RegisterGType.  

Oh and before anyone mentions that native type registration should be
done automatically, they should go through the exercise of figuring out
how and posting a patch for it, because if I knew how to do that, it
would be done already.  :)
