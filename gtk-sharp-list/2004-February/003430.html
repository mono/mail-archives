<PRE>Sorry if too late, but there are now packages for SuSE9 in the download
area of go-mono.com

Enjoy!

</I>&gt;<i> That won't do very easy, as it seems. I spent many hours installing dependencies, but found out that even if I did, they were still missing according to Yast2. Since I probably have some garbage left in my system from a total failure trying to install an unsupported XimianDesktop on this machine I started cleaning out everything named &quot;gnome&quot; or &quot;GTK&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, now I'll give it a go again, but thought I should check if anyone had a better installation method then trying to install this .rpm's (libgtkhtml3.0/gtkhtml3.0/lipopt.. whatever the name was).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My expereince tells me that it might be stupid, since none of these are supported in standard SuSe I have to grav them from rpmseek..
