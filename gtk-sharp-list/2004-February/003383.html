</I>I didn't say you were crazy for writing C.  I said this case might not
be necessary or appropraite and mentioned some reasons why.
I just wanted to play devils advocate and make sure you considered other
options. I have nothing against C code at all where appropriate.  I do
have something against unneeded complexity based on &quot;it is faster&quot;. Of
course if you write things in C it will be faster.  It may well be
justified, but since it would be the only instance of non-glue C in Gtk#
(I think) do we need the extra complexity and burden of maintenance.  I
think Mike stated reasons very well in his reply.
