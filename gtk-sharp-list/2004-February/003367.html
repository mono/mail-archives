What type of additions/rework were you thinking needed done?  It seems
like people are using it effectively as it is now, so I'm interested in
why you've chosen that area to get involved with.

With any of the Gtk# bound libraries (including Glade#), if you want to
work on the binding, you should post your intentions here on this list. 
This is so that we can give feedback on your proposed changes before you
spend a lot of time doing something that might not be accepted, and also
so we aren't duplicating effort.  You'll also need to post patches to
the list for approval before they can be committed into CVS.
