<PRE>A few weeks ago I was mucking around with glade and the glade-sharp 
libraries to create a test application.  I had a great deal of trouble 
getting to compile and run because properites like stockitem where not 
found.  I have yet to test this with gtk-sharp-0.16, if the problem was 
removed, then I'll keep looking for bugs :)
