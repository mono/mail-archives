<PRE>There was a thread about context menus in a treeview about a year ago on this
list, but it never really seemed to get resolved. I'm still not sure how to do
it. You'd think it would be a pretty standard feature. I mean, if you want to
add a leaf to a treeview from the GUI, the most natural thing to do would be
right click and scroll down to &quot;Create&quot; or if you want to delete, right click
and scroll down to &quot;Delete,&quot; right?

Anyway, from what I understand, the problem is that the &quot;ButtonPressEvent&quot; isn't
valid in a TreeView. For some reason, programmers are not supposed ot have
access to button presses in a treeview. It is in some FAQ and it isn't
considered a bug. Well, what I did was override OnButtonPressEvent, call the
base OnButtonPressEvent, then trigger my own  event, passing the button args
along. I guess this crashed gtk-sharp 0.15, but it works on 0.16. 

My problem now is that I can't tell the difference between a button press on a
row or a button press on empty space. My code knows its &quot;context&quot; by the
currently selected row in teh tree. Which works most of the time... unless you
are clicking on blank space, in which case, you'd want to pull up a different
menu. Possibly a &quot;global&quot; menu for the treeview. 

Is there any reliable way for me to know if the pointer is currently over a row
during an event?
