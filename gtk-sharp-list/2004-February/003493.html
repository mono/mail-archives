We don't put our docs inline using the docs tags, because we intend to
eventually localize them to an enormous number of languages, and that
would be a nightmare to do right in the sources.

We use an xml file format that has been created by the monodoc project
to document Gtk#.  In the source tree, you will notice a doc directory
which currently only has English (en) docs under it.  I would suggest
hooking up with John Luke about documenting Gtk#, as he has been the
lead dude on Gtk# docs so far.  I think he's gotten distracted by
working on some silly IDE application though, recently.  :)

&gt;<i> eitherway, whats the procedure to help out?

It can be as simple as viewing the docs in monodoc and using their
WebService interface to file patches.  You might want to subscribe to
mono-docs-list as well, although I'm not sure how active that list is at
this point.

We'd appreciate whatever assistance you are able to lend in the docs
effort.

Thanks,
