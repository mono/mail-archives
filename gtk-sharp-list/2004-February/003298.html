&gt;<i> &gt; Symptoms: a program fails to open &quot;libgtk-x11-2.0.so&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Questions: why is this file used at all? It is only a virtual symlink to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the library which corresponds to the headers/pkgconfig data. The library
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; must be opened at runtime by using its SONAME:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It helps to change the config of mono (/etc/mono/config), so that it will load
</I>
Thanks for the hint, I forgot about that file.

&gt;<i> the library by the SONAME. For the mandrake packages I used a static
</I>&gt;<i> configfile for this, but it would be better to generate this in a dynamic way.
</I>&gt;<i> No idea how to do that though.
</I>
I have a simple idea for a workaround, though not a good one... At
build-time, resolve SONAMEs and create a link from $soname to
/usr/lib/libgtk-x11-2.0.so.SHARP, ship this symlink with the package.
And insert this file into the mono config.

How do your lines look like? (Just for interest ;)

&gt;<i> It doesn't work for all cases though, running muine will try to load the glade
</I>&gt;<i> and gconf library through the devel library, and I'm not sure why that is (I
</I>
Mh, muine does not work for me at all, it segfaults on invocation (Gnome
crash dialog). And it requests the lib by the name &quot;libmuine&quot;, I had to
set the full path in the mono config.

&gt;<i> &gt; ldd /usr/lib/libgtksharpglue.so | wc -l
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 64
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That is one of the most chaotic lib namespace management I have ever seen!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am not a Gtk-Sharp developer but I strongly recommend to cleanup
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there, very, very, soon. libgtksharpglue.so should be linked with only most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; important libs, and use dlopen to open others, but using their SONAMEs,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not .so, and not using anything listed in .la files since they often
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cause the whole system to wreak random havoc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here it is linked with the SONAME's. that's the same for you?
</I>
Yes, see the 64 above.

&gt;<i> I was about to post a message about this issue as well. It is easy to package
</I>&gt;<i> the gtk-sharp dll files in seperate packages, but they all depend on the glue
</I>&gt;<i> library. So even if you just use gtk-sharp.dll in a piece of software, it
</I>&gt;<i> still loads glade, gnome libraries, gda, gnome-db, etc, because the glue
</I>&gt;<i> library needs it. Would it be possible to split the glue library in the same
</I>&gt;<i> way as the dll libraries? That would make it possible to have more finegrained
</I>&gt;<i> packaging, without having to install all dependencies for just one app.
</I>
Yup, we have the same request, people wish to see more grained
packages, eg. only gda-sharp to use libgda and not install the whole
bunch of Gnome dependencies. Currently, it does not make sence because
whatever you do, the library is hard-linked with every library and
AFAICS won't work if any of them is missing.

Eduard.
