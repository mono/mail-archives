Years of Windows development and reading MSDN.  More the latter, though
plenty of the former occurred as well.  It's &quot;well known&quot; that PATH is
searched for DLLs.  The application's directory is also searched now,
but that wasn't the case ~10 years ago, IIRC.

I've also been using/learning parts of .NET since the betas, and the
distinction between shared and private assemblies is well documented in
MSDN and in .NET-related books.
