It has less to do with Mono's GAC not being finished, and more to do
with the Gtk# DLLs not being Shared Assemblies (meaning, they're not
signed, don't have a public key, and thus couldn't be placed in the GAC
even if Mono had one).

I'm not sure when this will be fixed (hopefully before Mono's GAC is
complete, so we can have a test case ;-), but for the time being,
they're private assemblies, and thus *must* be in the same directory as
the executable.

`regsvr32' is used to register COM DLLs (DLLs with a DllRegisterServer()
export, among others), which doesn't describe GTK+ or Gtk#.  So it's
perfectly sensible that regsvr32 wouldn't do anything. :-)

&gt;<i> I've read all the docs I could find, I've search google and the lack

Gtk# is a managed wrapper over GTK+.  Thus, you need GTK+ installed and
working, and the GTK+ libraries either need to be (1) in the same
directory as your application, or (2) in the PATH, or (3) installed in a
well-known location, like %WINDIR%\system32.

It's been awhile since I've done anything with Windows, though, so
hopefully someone else can elaborate.

You can find a GTK+ for Windows install here, as part of the Gimp:
