Gtk# doesn't do any drawing itself.  It is a binding of the underlying
Gtk+ libraries which do all the drawing directly through the native
cairo library.

Mono.Cairo is the managed binding for the native cairo library.  You
would only need it if you were using Cairo from managed code to scribble
on windows.

The missing warning in mcs is something you would need to raise on
another list, maybe mono-devel-list.  I assume what is happening there
is that csc detects that gdk-sharp.dll depends on Mono.Cairo.dll but it
doesn't know where to find it.  We should also add that dep to the .pc
file, I suppose.
