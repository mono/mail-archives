Your friendly Gtk# for MS .NET installer maintainer here:

I was hoping to keep this quiet until everything had been through QA,
but -- I've been working off and on for the past couple weeks on a new
installer framework[1] using WiX[2] instead of InnoSetup.

WiX targets the MSI spec, and as such, supports building installers made
up of pluggable components called Merge Modules.  The main benefit this
brings to the table for Gtk# is that each component (i.e.: Gtk+, Aspell,
Poppler, Gtk#, etc) can be maintained as an individual merge module, and
later merged into one combined installer with as many or as little merge
modules as needed.

Merge modules can also be merged into installers for individual
applications, but this approach needs more research, as two installers
that provide Gtk# would possibly conflict on the system.

The end result of this is that it has pushed out my timeline for
releasing Gtk# 2.10.4 support until I feel confident that this new
framework won't shoot anyone in the foot.  This combined with work
pulling me in a different direction for the next two or three weeks,
mean it's unlikely that I'll have much time to work on the installers in
the near term.

That being said, it would be helpful if a few steel-toed volunteers
could step up and help out with testing and development of these new
installers so that it can be released sooner rather than later.  If
anyone is willing, send me an email, and I can get you set up with
experimental builds.

As far as Gtk# 2.12 support, it's unlikely that I will have a need for
it at Medsphere due to aggressive timelines and the like, so if someone
would be willing to step up and work on it, I'd be happy to help out
wherever possible.  It shouldn't take more than 3-4 hours to set up a
build environment in Cygwin, build Gtk# and create a new merge module.

Cheers,

-Brad
