<PRE>Hi Miguel,

I have attached a new version of the Gtk# compilation instructions. 
Unfortunately I am not a native speaker but I hope my English is at 
least good enough to be understood :-) . I verfied them again from the 
beginning to make sure they actually work.

Of course I would volunteer to upload this article and to keep the Wiki 
information up to date. If you want me to do so you'd have to create me 
an account for the Wiki as I currently don't have access to it. 
Otherwise you can also upload them yourself.

You might have noticed that I finally got the installer work done and 
created a Gtk# 2.12 installer based on the one provided by Medsphere. I 
have also sent them a patch to update their installer to 2.12, but it 
didn't appear on their homepage yet. I think we should also host it on 
the Mono site, but we should ask them for permission at first. I'll deal 
with that and write you a mail when the situation is clear.

The update of the Mono Windows installer(which still ships with Gtk# 
2.10.4) will have to wait for another two weeks or so(there's now a lot 
of work to be done in my own application), but I promise to get back to 
it as soon as possible. Do you know who is maintaining it?

&gt;<i> Hello Christian,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     First of all, thank you a lot for posting this update about Gtk# on
</I>&gt;<i> Windows, this is a very painful issue for me, as for some reason we have
</I>&gt;<i> been absolutely unable to provide a Gtk# 2.12 natively for .NET.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     So far, the great guys at Medsphere have been doing the work in
</I>&gt;<i> supporting Gtk# for .NET, while we supported it for Mono on Windows, but
</I>&gt;<i> while we support 2.12, they only were up to 2.10, so your post is very
</I>&gt;<i> timely. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Getting Gtk# to work took me about 7 full-time days mainly because of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the broken gapi-cdecl-insert script(see 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=417615">https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=417615</A>) and the deprecated 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> documentation here: 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Compiling_Mono#Building_GTK.23.">http://www.mono-project.com/Compiling_Mono#Building_GTK.23.</A> It points to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> old Gtk versions, is much more complicated than the solution I found, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does not mention that you have to install some Mono assemblies into the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MS GAC(Mono.Cairo, etc.) and also does not explain building Gtk# for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mono(it only says how to build it for the MS GAC and the Mono build is a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> little more complicated).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Would you mind telling me what is wrong on the Wiki, or perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> would you mind making the changes to the Wiki yourself to have the
</I>&gt;<i> information up-to-date for Windows people?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mike, if I sent you an updated version of the Doku, could you upload it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the Mono Wiki?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I can, and would love to do it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Again, I would be great if someone could help me with the installer so 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that we soon have a 2.12 version of Gtk# for Windows :-)
