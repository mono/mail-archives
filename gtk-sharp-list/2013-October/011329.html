<PRE>Dylan,

 From memory &quot;gdl-sharp&quot; itself was a project implemented by a third 
party, separate from the Mono or MonoDevelop teams. I'm not sure that 
they ever released the assembly publicly. However all they did was take 
the docking code from the MonoDevelop sources itself and package it into 
a dynamically linked library, which should be fairly trivial to do. The 
MonoDeveop sources are pretty well organised so you should just need to 
separate everything in the &quot;&lt;MonoDevelop 
Checkout&gt;\main\src\core\MonoDevelop.Ide\MonoDevelop.Components.Docking&quot; 
folder. I'd recommend using one of the stable branches rather than the 
master as they are likely to be more stable. You can find the sources on 
the MonoDevelop github 
&lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/mono/monodevelop/tree/monodevelop-4.1.12-branch">https://github.com/mono/monodevelop/tree/monodevelop-4.1.12-branch</A>&gt;.

As a side note, if you're developing a cross platform IDE in C# the 
Mono.TextEditor.TextEditor widget could be very useful for you when it 
comes to implementing a code editor.
