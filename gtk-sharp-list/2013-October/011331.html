I was afraid of that. I found some search results for someone making
gdl-sharp and I was hoping it had some work on it. But, I can easily
extract what I need from MonoDevelop.

They did a very good job of organizing the code. :) I've enjoyed working in
it.


&gt;<i> &quot;&lt;MonoDevelop
</I>&gt;<i> Checkout&gt;\main\src\core\MonoDevelop.Ide\MonoDevelop.Components.Docking&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> folder. I'd recommend using one of the stable branches rather than the

Cool. If I go down that direction, I'll start from there. I did the same
with the text editor (started with MonoDevelop's and modified it).


&gt;<i> As a side note, if you're developing a cross platform IDE in C# the
</I>&gt;<i> Mono.TextEditor.TextEditor widget could be very useful for you when it
</I>&gt;<i> comes to implementing a code editor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I actually started there, but I was having trouble loading a 624k word
novel into it and still getting all the contextual stuff I needed (mostly
background processing of lines while editing and loading/unloading code).
But, I took the ideas and made one that abstracted out the Document class
into a line provider.

Thank you.
