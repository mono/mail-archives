<PRE>Salutations.

I'm currently working on a relatively large project of mine and it is
inspired by Visual Studio. It's also cross-platform at the moment (Windows
and Linux).

One of the biggest things I want to eventually add is docking windows for a
bunch of elements. According to Google, that would be in the gdl-sharp
library, but I can't seem to find one that would work with both Windows and
Linux and either plays well with 2.12 or 3.x libraries.

Is there one already packaged? Or in a state that needs a bit of love to
make it work?

Thank you.

- Dylan
