<PRE>You can look at the gtk# 0.10 Windows Installer that Mathias created.  =
It puts the gtk# assemblies into the GAC. =20

GTK# 0.11+ that Johannes and I worked on was for Mono 0.28.

This is by design.  For .NET. :-)

The Gtk# assemblies probably aren't &quot;public&quot; assemblies.  Meaning that
they likely don't have a strong name, haven't been signed, and aren't
located in the Global Assembly Cache.

Which means that they're &quot;private&quot; (non-shared) assemblies.  Which means
that they *must* be located in the same directory as the program.

So you have one of four choices:

  - Run your program under mono, which you've tried

  - Copy your program into mono-0.28\lib, which you've done

  - Copy the Gtk# DLLs into your programs directory

  - Wait (or help) for Gtk# to become strong-named, so it can be placed=20
    in the GAC.  Last I heard, the hold-up with this was that we didn't
    want to deal with two separate build routines (one for Linux, one=20
    for .NET), and Linux didn't have the functionality for signing=20
    assemblies.  This is not longer entirely true, thanks to =
S=C3=A9bastien
    Pouliot.

    I have no idea when mono will have full support for signing=20
    assemblies, though.

 - Jon
