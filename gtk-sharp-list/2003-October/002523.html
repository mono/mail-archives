</I>&gt;<i>Should I use reflection to get the properties out of the examples, or should
</I>&gt;<i>I do it by hand like in this examples ?

</I>I made a few changed to what you sent the other day.  Mostly making the 
code look more like c# than c (at least in my opinion), and do some of 
the tree/list stuff you were stuck on.  Also, I made it so it compiled 
into one assembly, and the examples are launched when you double-click 
on the tree.

Someone would need to still finish most of the examples themselves, and 
also, the loading and unloading of the source in the notebook.  (Maybe 
include the .cs files as resources?) You can download what I have at 
<A HREF="http://helios.acomp.usf.edu/~luke/gtksharp-demo.tar.bz2">http://helios.acomp.usf.edu/~luke/gtksharp-demo.tar.bz2</A> which includes a 
makefile and the images.

Perhaps we should put it in cvs under gtk-sharp/samples/gtksharp-demo if 
people are interested in finishing it.  I think some of the examples may 
fit into monodoc eventually as well.
