Well I'm certainly not an expert but I would do it like this:
Put an HBox in the main window.
Pack a VBox into the Hbox
Put all your buttons into this vbox..
Pack another vbox into your Hbox.  This vbox will be where you put your 
scrolledwindow and such.
In your Clicked eventhandler for a button on the left, remove the right 
vbox from your hbox, (hbox.Remove(widgetToRemove)) and populate a new vbox 
with the widgets you want on the new screen.  Then add this new vbox back 
to the hbox.
So when you click the button it will change the contents on the right side.

Which brings me to a minor point.  If you remove a container like a vbox 
from another one, does the vbox and all child widgets get destroyed?
My application switches between screens with many buttons quite often in 
this manner and I've noticed that memory usage of mono increases every 
time...

Thanks,
Leo
