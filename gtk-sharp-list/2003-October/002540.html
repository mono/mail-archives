Yes it seems to be a simple case of the main developers just not having
the 
time to answer many questions and there just aren't enough other 
developers to handle tasks like documentation and user support.  

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Maybe you response depending what kind of difficulty the question.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Maybe I'm a horrible writting in english (this is true :) sorry)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Maybe It is only fortuitousness.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ok, sorry for this, but you don't know how difficult it is to pass

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Every time that i want to start hacking in some that is &quot;free&quot; i get

&gt;<i> &gt; frustrated beacause i can't find the necesary documentation, or it

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this, but i see that this is not. (maybe i use many times maybe :D, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can be) I tell you this, beacause it is the only way for changing 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this (if you want). It is true that i'm not a n*x hacker, but i'm 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; developing in about 10 years in m$, i think, that i have some 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; knowledge to start developing in mono, and i see that is good but i 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can't.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry. This is like a Constructive Criticism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheer up! I know how hard it is to find good information. I try to

</I>
Yup, lots of the documentation either doesn't exist, is incomplete, or
just 
plain doesn't work.  Thats just a part of working on a project that is 
essentially in its infancy.  The documentation linked to on the mono 
website is very bad (no offence the the authors, I intend to help out
with 
that once I have some time).  Checkout the monodoc and gtk-sharp modules

from cvs.  The documentation which is there is quite helpful.

Good luck.  I started programming with mono and GTK# a month ago and am 
going through the same thing but it gets easier all the time.

The GC runs in a different thread, and changes to the gui have to come
from a single thread.

&gt;<i> 2. The header of Object.cs has a TODO:

That's probably left over from an earlier implementation.

I committed a different fix that keeps all enum matching in the one
branch.  Thanks for the patch.

Subject: [Gtk-sharp-list] Monodoc 0.7 has been released.

Hello everyone!

    MonoDoc 0.7 has been released.  This release contains tons of
improvements, and tons of new documentation.

* What is new

	* Web-based edition: Monodoc now runs as a GUI client and 
	  also as a web service provider (you can see it live in
	  www.go-mono.com/docs/index.html

	  It uses a beautiful Javascript based tree to dynamically load
	  the new tree contents.   A *beautiful* hack from Piers Haken. 

	* C# spec is now part of the documentation 
	
	* All errors generated by MCS are included with samples
	  so you can find out what errors mean.

	* Many GUI improvements. 

* Improvements

	* Class library rendering can now group methods with the
	  same name (and a nice page for overloads is also generated).

	* Prettier documentation rendering for class libraries.

	* Keyboard navigation 

	* Window for multi-matches provides more contextual information.

	* Incremental searching updates multi-matches on the flight.

* Availability:

	<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/monodoc-0.7.tar.gz">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/monodoc-0.7.tar.gz</A>

	Requires Gtk# 0.11 and Mono 0.28

* Contributors

        This release would not have been possible without the help of
        everyone who contributed to the effort, here is a list of coders
        and documentors that made this possible:
        
        Alejandro Sanchez, Alp Toker, Ben Maurer, Duncan Mak, Gonzalo
        Paniagua, Hector Gomez, Johannes Roith, John Luke, Jonathan
        Pryor, Joshua Tauberer, Martin Baulig, Martin Willemoes, Miguel
        de Icaza and Piers Haken.
