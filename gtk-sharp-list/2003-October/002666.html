Asking the same question repeatedly isn't necessarily the best way to
get a new answer. 
 
But just so maybe you'll stop asking the question, I did the research
and scanned the gtkentry.c source. It looks like editing-done is only
emited on Enter, Up, Down, or Escape keypress.  It sounds like that's
not what you want. If you want different behavior, you'll have to ask
for it from the gtk+ folks.

I don't think it's &quot;really dirty&quot; to use focus-out to update your data
store.  That's probably the most reliable way to identify when your user
is no longer working on that value, since you don't want to use Changed
to do instantaneous updates.
