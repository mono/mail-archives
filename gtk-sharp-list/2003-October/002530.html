Yes it seems to be a simple case of the main developers just not having the 
time to answer many questions and there just aren't enough other 
developers to handle tasks like documentation and user support.  

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Maybe you response depending what kind of difficulty the question.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Maybe I'm a horrible writting in english (this is true :) sorry)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Maybe It is only fortuitousness.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ok, sorry for this, but you don't know how difficult it is to pass
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from M$ to n*x for someone who really dont know anything about n*x.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Every time that i want to start hacking in some that is &quot;free&quot; i get
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; frustrated beacause i can't find the necesary documentation, or it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not very clair for my. I think that this kind of lists are for this,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but i see that this is not.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (maybe i use many times maybe :D, can be)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I tell you this, beacause it is the only way for changing this (if you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; want). It is true that i'm not a n*x hacker, but i'm developing in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about 10 years in m$, i think, that i have some knowledge to start
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; developing in mono, and i see that is good but i can't.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry. This is like a Constructive Criticism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheer up! I know how hard it is to find good information. I try to read
</I>&gt;<i> the docs which are written, then read the src, then ask here. Its pretty
</I>&gt;<i> hard. But it is getting better each day, more and more documentation is

</I>
Yup, lots of the documentation either doesn't exist, is incomplete, or just 
plain doesn't work.  Thats just a part of working on a project that is 
essentially in its infancy.  The documentation linked to on the mono 
website is very bad (no offence the the authors, I intend to help out with 
that once I have some time).  Checkout the monodoc and gtk-sharp modules 
from cvs.  The documentation which is there is quite helpful.

Good luck.  I started programming with mono and GTK# a month ago and am 
going through the same thing but it gets easier all the time.
