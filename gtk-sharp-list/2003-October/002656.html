Hey Jason,

I had the same problem before and the reason is you need to have the mcs
source code installed.  If you installed mono from an rpm you do not get
the source code too.  This is what I had done.  What I did then was
login to the anonymous CVS server:  

export CVSROOT=:pserver:<A HREF="mailto:anonymous@anoncvs.go-mono.com">anonymous@anoncvs.go-mono.com</A>:/mono
	cvs login
	cvs -z3 co mcs 

Go to www.go-mono.com it explains CVS access there and other mondules to 
checkout. 
This will get you the mcs source code.  There you can see in the mcs dir
there will be a dir named errors.  Now monodoc will hopefully install. As long as 
the mcs dir is two &quot;levels&quot; up (../../) from the class dir in monodoc.  SO
make mcs dir on the same &quot;level&quot; as your monodoc dir.
