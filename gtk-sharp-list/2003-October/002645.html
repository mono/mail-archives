<PRE>An alternative to the previously-suggested way to do it would be to use 
a Notebook widget on the right-hand side. You construct all the possible 
views on seperate pages of this widget, and switch pages via the clicked 
handlers of the buttons. The Notebook in GTK does allow you to turn tabs 
off, so the users won't ever notice it (assuming it's properly wrapped 
in GTK#, I've only tried this trick in gtkmm, where it works very well).

A disadvantage is that you have the memory use of all the controls all 
the time, even the ones that aren't visible, but unless you're 
deliberately deconstructing and reconstructing each time you switch 
pages, you're going to have that even with reparenting I would have thought.

The major advantage is that this is ridiculously easy to implement.

Hope that helps
