Splitting the glue into separate libs is fine, but there's no need to
move around all the files like this.  I want to stick with one glue
directory that holds all the glue code.  If the Makefile.am in that dir
generates 3 different libs, fine.

libgnomesharpglue isn't an issue on win32, but libgladesharpglue would
be.  We should do the change to both win32 and linux at the same time,
if we're going to do it.

Can someone who has cvs admin privs (*cough* Miguel *cough*) kill the
gtk/glue, gnome/glue, and glade/glue directories that were added
tonight?  While you're at it, the gdk.imaging and gphoto dirs could be
killed too.
