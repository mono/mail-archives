Hey Leo,

I am not an expert either but this is what I have found so far.  

I figured out a way to split the application into to separate areas.  I
used the concept of Panes.  There are widgets available for both a
horizontal panes and vertical panes.  I created a horizontal plane and
then used the left portion for my column of buttons and the right
portion for my scrolled window. However, I have not been able to figure
out how to dynamically display &quot;services&quot; in the scrolled portion. 

On your point of deleting a vertical packing box and if the deleting
trickles down to all the child widgets the answer is yes.  The packing
box is a container just like a window so any widgets within the
container are destroyed upon destruction of the container.  What you
could possibly do instead of deleting and recreating a new vertical
packing box each time....maybe hide each of the widgets within the
packing box and then show them accordingly.  Now I figure there has to
be a much easier way then this.  I had thought of trying to do what you
are doing...but personally you are a better man than I because I would
not want to deal with the deletion and recreation.  Maybe there is to
layer the &quot;services&quot; on the scrolled window or in your case packing box
like a stack where the &quot;service&quot; on the top of the stack is displayed. 
Accordingly you can push and pop the stack of &quot;services&quot; based on the
actions of the user.  Like I said I am no expert these are just
suggestions.  Ill keep you informed if a find a way dynamically change
the window.  If Evolution can do then it can be done.     

Joe
