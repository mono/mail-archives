I have installed mono-1.0.1 using the .dmg distribution.

I was following the instructions to install the Gtk# in order to 
compile mod_mono so i can run asp.net pages on my apache server found 
at <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/using/macos.html">http://www.mono-project.com/using/macos.html</A> .

I have installed Fink and also these packages as suggested: pango1-xft2 
pango1-xft2-dev pango1-xft2-shlibs gtk+2 gtk+2-dev gtk+2-shlibs libart2 
libart2-shlibs libgnomecanvas2 libgnomecanvas2-dev 
libgnomecanvas2-shlibs libgnomeui2 libgnomeui2-dev libgnomeui2-shlibs 
libgnomeprintui2.2 libgnomeprintui2.2-dev libgnomeprintui2.2-shlibs 
libglade2 libglade2-shlibs libgda libgda-dev libgda-shlibs librsvg2 
librsvg2-shlibs gtkhtml3 gtkhtml3-dev gtkhtml3-shlibs vte vte-dev 
vte-shlibs xft2-dev libgnomedb libgnomedb-dev libgnomedb-shlibs

I downloaded gtk# from CVS and tried to compile it following the read 
me instructions running:
./autogen.sh from the gtk-sharp directory. But I get the following 
error:


checking for mono &gt;= 0.96... Package mono was not found in the 
pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `mono.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
No package 'mono' found
checking for csc.exe... no
configure: error: You need to install either mono or .Net


So then I tried running these lines instead as suggested by the mono 
instructions:
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/sw/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/X11R6/lib/pkgconfig
PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH
./autogen.sh --prefix=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/1.0.1

But this appeared to get this error instead:
Running autoheader...
Can't locate object method &quot;path&quot; via package &quot;Autom4te::Request&quot; at 
/usr/bin/autom4te line 81.
autoheader: /usr/bin/autom4te failed with exit status: 1
**Error**: autoheader failed.

I think that is to do with the incorrect PATH statement. So I quit 
terminal and started a new one and ran this again without setting the 
PATH:
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/sw/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/X11R6/lib/pkgconfig
./autogen.sh --prefix=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/1.0.1

I got this error:
checking for mono &gt;= 0.96... Package mono was not found in the 
pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `mono.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
No package 'mono' found
checking for csc.exe... no
configure: error: You need to install either mono or .Net

Can some please guide me into how to fix this issue. It is obviously 
looking for 0.96 and I have 1.0.1, but is that an issue?

Thanks very much in advance for your help.
