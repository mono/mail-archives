<PRE>Hey,
	I would first like to thank Paco for all his work on the GTK# installer
and the Visual Studio Add-In (vsprj2make).  In addition, his assistance
and feedback on the list has helped me tremendously.  And I would like to
say how much I appreciate all he has done.

	The reason I am writing is that I am using the GTK# VS.Net Plug-in to
write a demo app but I am unable to find a Data Grid widget/component. 
The closest thing that Glade provides is a &quot;List or Tree View&quot; widget;
but it does not have databinding capabilities...  I did find some code
that allows me to dump database results into the &quot;List or Tree View&quot;
widget at <A HREF="http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/monodevelop.asp...">http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/monodevelop.asp...</A>

	My questions are...  Does GTK have a &quot;Data Grid&quot; widget?  Is someone
developing or has someone developed one?

        I was thinking about trying to write an object that allow a user
to pass the &quot;Tree View/List View&quot; widget and a DataSet in so that
it would populate the widget with data.  However if it is already
written or something similar exists, I don't want to reinvent the
wheel.

Thanks,
Robert
