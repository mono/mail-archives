Right. We will still need things like
System.ComponentModel.DefaultEventAttribute, but since we're also going
to need other things that aren't in System.ComponentModel, it feels like
it would be cleaner to have all of the attributes, etc we need in one
namespace, rather than using half of System.ComponentModel, plus a bunch
of other things from GLib.something.

I don't know for sure on this yet. Two possibilities are:
      * If you annotate your properties with the (as-yet-nonexistent)
        paramspec-specifying attributes, then ParamSpecs are constructed
        and registered with glib at RegisterGType time
      * If you annotate your properties, they aren't registered with
        glib, but instead ParamSpecs are constructed when you call
        GLib.Object.LookupProperty()

I don't know if there's any advantage to doing the former.
