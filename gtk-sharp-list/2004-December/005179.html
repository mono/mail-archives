That is all well and good, but how does GParamSpec allow for specifying
context menu commands, double click actions, and drag and drop, etc. We
still need attributes/code to handle that, and it should be in something
like gtk# so that external widget writers don't need to depend on some
stetic library that just has attributes for marking up widgets.

My assumption is that it doesn't, and we would need to just need to add
more attributes, correct?

Other than that, everything sounds right.
