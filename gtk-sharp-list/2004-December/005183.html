</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There's multiple issues probably.  The assembly version reported for all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; these should probably be 2.0.0.0, in svn trunk.  We also need a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mechanism to mark API as new in a particular API version.  I don't know
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if monodoc already automatically marks &quot;Obsolete&quot; API, if not, that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be a nice feature as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would it not be right that the AssemblyVersion in the docs is the
</I>&gt;<i> version in which it was added?  At least that is how I was thinking (the
</I>&gt;<i> equivalent of gtk's since $version).  Monodoc handles [Obsolete] through
</I>&gt;<i> the updater I believe.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
No, for docs shipping with 2.0.0.0 it should be 2.0.0.0 globaly, as that
is the version of the assembly the documentation corresponds with.

And I believe Mike was talking about monodoc displaying some fu that
shows that a specific method/class/thing is Obsolete.
