There's multiple issues probably.  The assembly version reported for all
these should probably be 2.0.0.0, in svn trunk.  We also need a
mechanism to mark API as new in a particular API version.  I don't know
if monodoc already automatically marks &quot;Obsolete&quot; API, if not, that
would be a nice feature as well.

Writing an XPath tool to update all the assembly versions to 2.0.0.0 is
a piece of cake.  The other stuff seems like it could be automated with
a corcompare-like tool.  It would be nice if somebody wants to take
charge of making this happen.  It is something that we should be working
towards now instead of trying to pull it out of our hat during the final
release cycle.  ;-)

Volunteers?  At the very least, we need to get some bug reports in place
to make sure we don't forget the issue, but it would be nice if the bugs
had owners, pronto.
