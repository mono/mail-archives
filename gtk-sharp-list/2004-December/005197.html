Hopefully my GnomeVfsTest.cs will replace TestVfs.cs (bug #70262).
It's pretty much a total rewrite of TestVfs.cs but still does the same
basic things: show file info, write to file, read from file, open file
asynchronously, and create a new file asynchronously. I wasn't sure
what to put on the author's line though. Read over the code and feel
free to add yourself if you want or make cosmetic changes (e.g. I
prefer fewer 'using' statements). I'm just trying to get my foot in
the door and actually make some contributions :-).

However, I'm not sure that TestVfs.cs / GnomeVfsTest.cs is needed with
the presence of the sample/gnomevfs/* programs. Feel free to reopen
the bug and push for a removal. No use in crufting up the code.

&gt;<i> Could you open a new bug at bugzilla.ximian.com with the

Okay. The bug has been posted as #70260 with the patch attached.

I'll use bugzilla from now on. The only reason I posted to the group
was HACKING says:

&quot;Prior to checking anything into CVS, please send a patch to the mailing list
for approval.&quot;

I guess it makes more sense to just post the bug #. Then I don't have
to worry about fscking MIME. Sorry for spamming the group. I guess
reading the line again, that is probably what it means.

I hope I did the whole bugzilla thing right. I've only done a couple
of bugs before and I haven't fixed any.
