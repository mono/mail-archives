<PRE>This is a brain dump on why I don't think we want to use
System.ComponentModel for Gtk# widget metadata (in particular, why we
don't want to use it *instead* of binding GParamSpec).

Reasons suggested for why we might want to use it, with rebuttals:

	1. &quot;It's in System.dll; it's there whether or not we use it.&quot;

	   This is pretty much true, although some parts of
	   System.ComponentModel.Design are actually in
	   System.Design.dll.

	   However, we currently have 10 MonoTODOs, 9 FIXMEs and 13
           LAMESPECs in our System.ComponentModel implementation, and
           System.ComponentModel.Design is even shakier.

	2. &quot;It works for both SWF and ASP.NET, we ought to be able to
           make it work for us too.&quot;

	   Dubious. I think it really only works for them because SWF,
	   ASP.NET, and ComponentModel were all designed together.

	   The widget-annotating attributes are well-adapted to SWF,
           but not so well-adapted to Gtk. For instance, GParamSpecs
           let you specify upper and lower bounds for a numeric
           property, but ComponentModel doesn't. Gtk's container/child
           model is very different from SWF's. ComponentModel doesn't
           seem to have anything a11y-related. Etc.

	   More specifically, ComponentModel and ComponentModel.Design
	   are not APIs for interacting with a generic design
	   environment, they're APIs for interacting with *Visual
	   Studio* specifically. Two really bad examples are
	   S.CM.D.StandardToolWindows and S.CM.D.StandardCommands
	   which enumerate portions of the &quot;design-time interface&quot;
	   like the &quot;Related Links&quot; frame and the &quot;Send to Back&quot; menu
	   command. The widget-annotating attributes let you specify
	   context-menu commands and double-click actions to provide
	   when editing a widget, but not drag-and-drop behavior or
	   any other sort of interaction that VS doesn't support. Etc,
	   etc, etc

	3. It might make it easier for us to integrate Gtk# stuff into
	   Visual Studio?

	   This isn't a very strong point. IMHO, it's like saying &quot;we
	   should use XML so we can turn Stetic into a web service&quot;.
	   The amount of non-ComponentModel-related work that would be
	   needed in order to do this is so much larger than the
	   amount of ComponentModel-related work needed that I don't
	   even think it's worth thinking about until someone has at
	   least started working on it.

	4. It might make databinding support easier/better?

	   This seems to be a red herring. AFAICT, SWF databinding
	   does not make use of ComponentModel at all. It just uses
	   System.Reflection and SWF-specific stuff.

Rebuttals/comments/flames?
