<PRE>Hello,
	Some of the docs state the class is 'Assembly: gtk-sharp 0.0.0.0 (in
gtk-sharp.dll)' it would be nice to make sure that the ones that existed
in 1.0 were marked as so.  The key is also inconsistently included.
Mostly this was caused by the original updater did not update this info.
I don't know if the newer versions do or not.

It's probably the matter of substituting 0.0.0.0 for 1.0.0.0 as the
newer stuff seems to be getting 2.0.0.0 fine. sed would work fine for
the versions, but I thought someone want want to make a quick tool to do
both at once.
