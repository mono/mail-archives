<PRE>Hi folks,

as you may have noticed, old Gtk# versions (&lt; 2.12.8) did not use XP's 
visual styles. Later versions have a workaround: they call 
System.WIndows.Forms.Application.DoEvents which seems to enable XP's 
theming. This workaround is far from optimal as it created a Winforms 
dependency.

That's why I tried to integrate the code of Application.DoEvents into 
Gtk# directly. As I do not have a Windows XP machine to test, I cannot 
verify if it works.
I have attached an assembly and it's source code (change extension to 
.exe; GMail does not allow executables as attachments) that can be run 
with any Gtk# 2.12 version on XP. It uses a tweaked Gtk.Application 
class with a new mechanism to enable theming.

I would really appreciate some feedback from the community as to whether 
the new approach works (that is, if the attached application appears 
with visual styles enabled). Just reply with a screenshot of the running 
app on XP if you're not sure what I mean :-) .
