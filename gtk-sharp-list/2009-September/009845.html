<PRE>Hi All,
 
I have an windows application which is plotting the graph from values. 
 
It is not working with mono and giving method unimplemented exception.
 
Actually the application is using system.drawing for plotting the graph and
from momo analyzer output I got I think I cannot use that system.drawing
namespace in linux.
 
Anyone come across any implementation of plotting graph in linux or any
ideas?
 
Any help would be highly appreciated.
 
Many thanks,
Libin
