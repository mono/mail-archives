<PRE>My experience with GTK and OSX is very limited.
So it'll be an interesting learning curve.

I have done some digging though so at least I can save you some quality google time :)

Let's start at the end. OpenTK samples don't work for me on OSX.
They start, window updates, but no controls work, and menu is not responding.
The reason being message loop is not organized correctly.
There is a related post on the subject
<A HREF="http://www.opentk.com/node/2683">http://www.opentk.com/node/2683</A>
So once you get access to Mac it would be interesting to know, if samples work for you.
This situation gives me an impression that there is not much user base for OpenTK on OSX.
And I'm not sure if it is because of broken GLWidget, or the widget is broken because none cares.

Now, more to the point of X11 and OSX. I think it's currently using Quartz.
The reason I think so is I found several related bugs\issues on other projects.
Examples are
<A HREF="http://mono.1490590.n4.nabble.com/RFC-Add-API-to-get-Drawable-xid-for-user-with-GStreamer-td1546519.html">http://mono.1490590.n4.nabble.com/RFC-Add-API-to-get-Drawable-xid-for-user-with-GStreamer-td1546519.html</A>
<A HREF="http://code.haskell.org/gtk2hs/INSTALL">http://code.haskell.org/gtk2hs/INSTALL</A>
there was one more link, which I can no longer find - stating that GTK# is now built against Quartz on OSX.

I think asking Gtk-OSX and GTK-Quartz people is probably good idea.
Please, keep me posted. The least I can do is to help you test stuff.

Thanks

</I>&gt;<i> Just want to let you know that GLWidget has serious issues epsecially

</I>&gt;<i> The OSX related code in GLWidget looked suspicious to me as I read

</I>&gt;<i> I'll let you know. It would be very kind of you if you could do the

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any info on how GTK works on OSX would be helpful. But maybe this
