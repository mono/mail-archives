That's going to be hard to do without more details than &quot;the Combo
failed.&quot;  If you can provide a minimal sample application that
reproduces the problem, please open a bug report including the output
that occurs on failure.  

When you say you &quot;tried to run sql# for gtk# on Mono 1.1.7 for Windows&quot;
are you saying you tried to run a binary that was compiled against Gtk#
1.0.x on mono 1.1.7?  There are different assembly versions involved
there, so if the 1.1.7 installer doesn't have a set of Gtk# 1.0.x
assemblies in its GAC, that would be a problem.  I'm just stabbing in
the dark because the problem description above is fairly vague.

Gtk# 1.0.x and 2.x are parallel-installable and there is no current plan
to provide a mechanism to run applications compiled against 1.0.x on a
2.x installation.  You will still have to have 1.0.x assemblies
installed.  If this is the problem you are indicating, perhaps paco
needs to consider shipping a combined 1.0.x/2.x installer for Gtk# on
win32?  Either that or there needs to be a way to install 1.0.x and 2.x
Gtk# into a single mono install.

FWIW, I just compiled and ran the sample/test/WidgetViewer.exe
application on the MS 1.1 runtime with gladewin 2.6.8-rc1 and Gtk# trunk
and the Combo sample (which is still Gtk.Combo, not ComboBox) runs
without any problems.
