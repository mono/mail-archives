Onderwerp: [Gtk-sharp-list] GTK# Vs. System.Windows.Forms (Want reasons as
towhy GTK# is better)

&gt;&gt;<i>The main kill is the additional 5MB dependency to a &lt; 1 MB set [at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>most, since its all in .Net and tends to be small]. (if its possible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>to shrink down that size, that'd be great.. I'll try compressing all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the native libaries with UPX and trimming language stuff out.)
</I>
Someone who's willing to use torrent (which I believe to be evil :p)
they shouldn't complain about 5 additional megabytes, as they will be
Uploading/downloading a lot more than that.

&gt;&gt;<i>I've been trying to think up solid reasons as to why GTK# is better,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>but since S.W.F. is plowing ahead in Mono... cross-platform is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>lozing its ground in that matter.
</I>
SWF will hopefully ease cross-platform development, it won't lose ground

&gt;&gt;<i>Btw I'm using Glade# to hook up the GUI, in case there's special
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>advantages to that.
</I>
I've been told GLADE is evil, but writing GTK# code manually can be very
frustrating, so I wait for stetic


&gt;&gt;<i>Note: One thing I just saw as an advantage - 'Themes'.  I'll have to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>see how easy it is to change themes from GTK#.
</I>
Themes will take additional space (adding to the 5MB your project manager
complained about :-))
