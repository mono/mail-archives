<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> I'm trying to convince a project-manager as to why I should keep
</I>&gt;<i> working on GTK# as the UI rather than System.Windows.Forms.
</I>&gt;<i> The project is a GUI for a C# BitTorrent client library [it intends
</I>&gt;<i> to have mutliple-torrents, easy sharing, easy searching via RSS Feeds].
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The main kill is the additional 5MB dependency to a &lt; 1 MB set [at
</I>&gt;<i> most, since its all in .Net and tends to be small]. (if its possible
</I>&gt;<i> to shrink down that size, that'd be great.. I'll try compressing all
</I>&gt;<i>  the native libaries with UPX and trimming language stuff out.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've been trying to think up solid reasons as to why GTK# is better,
</I>&gt;<i> but since S.W.F. is plowing ahead in Mono... cross-platform is
</I>&gt;<i> lozing its ground in that matter.
</I>
You might want to read:

	<A HREF="http://mono-project.com/Gui_Toolkits">http://mono-project.com/Gui_Toolkits</A>

In addition, for Linux deployment, here are a few extras:

	* You get accessibility (and external scriptability through it).

	* It is more mature, S.W.F is making a lot of progress, but will
	  take some time to mature.

Your manager is right in that the download against S.W.F will be
smaller.

Miguel.
</PRE>
