<PRE>I'm trying to convince a project-manager as to why I should keep
working on GTK# as the UI rather than System.Windows.Forms.
The project is a GUI for a C# BitTorrent client library [it intends
to have mutliple-torrents, easy sharing, easy searching via RSS Feeds].

The main kill is the additional 5MB dependency to a &lt; 1 MB set [at
most, since its all in .Net and tends to be small]. (if its possible
to shrink down that size, that'd be great.. I'll try compressing all
 the native libaries with UPX and trimming language stuff out.)

I've been trying to think up solid reasons as to why GTK# is better,
but since S.W.F. is plowing ahead in Mono... cross-platform is
lozing its ground in that matter.

Btw I'm using Glade# to hook up the GUI, in case there's special
advantages to that.

Note: One thing I just saw as an advantage - 'Themes'.  I'll have to
see how easy it is to change themes from GTK#.
Thanks!
