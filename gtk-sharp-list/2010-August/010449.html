Ref and out mean that instead of passing parameters by value, you pass
them by reference.  The differences between out and ref are twofold:

* Out parameters must be assigned to in the method in which they are
declared before that method returns.

* Ref parameters must be assigned before they can be passed to another
method.

For example:

void Foo(out int a)
{
    a = 5; // Not doing this (leaving the method without assigning to
           // a) would be a compile-time error.
}

void Main()
{
    int b;
    Foo(out b);
    Console.WriteLine(b); // Writes &quot;5&quot;
}

If you would like, think of ref as an &quot;in-and-out&quot; parameter.  Both
allow the method being called to mess with locals and fields of other
methods/objects.

You must specify out/ref when calling the method too, for two reasons:
(1) It makes overloading possible (Foo(int) and Foo(ref int)) since
there would be no other way to disambiguate between a ref/non-ref
parameter, and (2) it makes it obvious at the call-site that the method
is allowed to change the local/field you have supplied.

In this particular case, the iter passed in to the Remove() method is
ref because a value is passed in (the iter to be removed) and a value is
passed out (the next iter in the store).

You may wonder why the next iter is not just returned... well, TreeIter
is a value type, so there is no &quot;null&quot; equivalent (except
TreeIter.Zero), so a bool is returned instead to tell you if there is
another row.  This makes loops easier to write:

while (model.Remove(ref node)) { ... }

Instead of something more verbose:

while ((node = model.Remove(node)) != TreeIter.Zero) { ... }

Anyway, I think I'm rambling now.

&gt;<i> Thank you very much for the help.

No problem.  If you have specific questions, just mail the list.  If I
have free time I'll reply; if not then someone else will probably respond.
