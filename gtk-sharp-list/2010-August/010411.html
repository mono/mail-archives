It's possible that GTK+ is consuming this event and marking it handled
before your code gets a chance to see it.  To remedy this, you have two
options, but this is the cleaner of the two:

Remove the signal binding in MD.  Then override the existing OnShown
event defined by Gtk.Window.  First have your code run, then before the
event returns, make sure you call &quot;base.OnShown()&quot; so that the Window
gets to handle the event too.  This is considered the correct,
object-oriented approach.

The other, less clean option is to add the &quot;[GLib.ConnectBefore]&quot;
attribute to your method, which will instruct the binding to insert your
event handler before the Window object's own handler.  But this would be
an evil, nasty thing to do.  :)
