My understanding (someone correct me if I'm wrong) is that the only iter
that is guaranteed to be valid is the one you're working on when you
mutate the tree.  Therefore the original node's iter will be invalid
after the first call to Remove().

To work around this, consider inserting your dummy node into the list of
child notes, right at the front.  Then call IterNext on that iter to get
the first child to remove, then proceed as normal.  So, do something
like this instead:

TreeIter node = GetIterBeingCollapsed();
int depth = model.IterDepth(node);

TreeIter dummy = model.InsertNode(node, 0);
// set values on dummy...

if (model.IterNext(ref dummy)) {
    while (model.IterDepth(dummy) &gt; depth &amp;&amp;
           model.Remove(ref dummy));
}
