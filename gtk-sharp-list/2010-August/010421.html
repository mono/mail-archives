The answer is not really obvious.  I looked into it a bit and found the
path you need to take.  Basically, attach to the renderer's edit-started
event (I forget what it's called).  This will be passed a CellEditable
object in the event args, which you can cast to a ComboBox.  Then bind
to the CellEditable's edit-finished event.  Use the reference to the
ComboBox to extract the selected iter.

Not hard, but definitely not straightforward.
