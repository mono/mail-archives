</I>
Well, I'm a community member, and that's what I plan to do, but it's
going to be a beta source release (see my previous mail on that
thread).
I happen to have upload rights to
<A HREF="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gtk-sharp,">http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gtk-sharp,</A> so it's going to be
hosted at the right place.

&gt;<i> Then others can create the preview windows installer, RPMs, and DEBs from
</I>&gt;<i> it, and mac installer.
</I>
I'm sure looking forward to anyone's help.

&gt;<i> We cannot depend on Xamarin anymore because all they care about is iOS and
</I>&gt;<i> Android devices these days.  Prove me wrong Xamarin.
</I>
Xamarin is a company that was created to provide tools to develop iOS
and Android apps, so they need to care about their customers.
But that doesn't mean what they do doesn't benefit all Mono and GTK#
users. For example, a bugfix was recently merged into GTK#,
contributed by Michael Hutchinson, a Xamarin employee:
<A HREF="https://github.com/mono/gtk-sharp/pull/51">https://github.com/mono/gtk-sharp/pull/51</A>
It fixes a long-standing bug in GTK#, and I think he worked on it as
part of his job on MonoDevelop.

&gt;<i> A lack of Gtk# 3.0 for Gtk+ 3.0 was the main reason Banshee was not included
</I>&gt;<i> in the default install of the latest Ubuntu.
</I>
As a Banshee maintainer, I can tell you that it was one of the
reasons, but it was not the only reason, by far.
