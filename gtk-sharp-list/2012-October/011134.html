I don't know if it ever was a focus of 'Mono'.,

You are confusing the Xamarin people with the Mono community.  No I
wouldn't expect anything useful to come from Xamarin.   You can't even
use Xamarin stuff on Linux.

&gt;<i> Also are not the Mono dev leaders planning on switching to XWT in 
</I>&gt;<i>the next year or so. I'm not sure how much focus will be on Gtk in 
</I>&gt;<i>the future, but again I may be wrong.
</I>
Gtk is ultimately bound to GNOME.  And there are top-notch GNOME
applications that use Gtk#.  The work on the bindings I'd expect to come
from that angle.

But xwt...

&quot;Xwt is a new .NET framework for creating desktop applications that run
on multiple platforms from the same codebase. Xwt works by exposing one
unified API across all environments that is mapped to a set of native
controls on each platform.&quot;

I wish them the best of luck, but I've heard this song before, and it
doesn't usually work out well.  The underlying controls don't correspond
to each other 1:1 and you get left with least-common-denominator and
lots of edge conditions.  Even if that works out there is the question
of how hard they will work on the Gtk backend [xwt sits on top of a
'native' toolkit, one backend is Gtk].  So you could end up with xwt as
a cross-toolkit abstraction layer that works on Windows and Mac and
others are red-headed step-children.  I doubt Xamarin has any real
interest in anything outside of Windows and Mac.

As for Gtk versions an Monodevelop - in the previous thread I don't see
any reference to opening a MD bug about the supporting later versions.
That would be step #1 I think.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into my deployed mono\bin directory, and that appears to work with all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; testing so far. (If anyone knows of a potential incompatibility please
