<PRE>Won't comment on the legal bits, but just pinpoint that GTK+ isn't
Linuxy C++, It's object-organized pure C code.

&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm having problems with users who seem to either have other versions
</I>&gt;<i> of Gtk# or Gtk+ installed (under Windows), or for whom the installer
</I>&gt;<i> from Novell is malfunctioning. As a result my app can't find its
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies and won't run. This is generating one or two bug reports
</I>&gt;<i> a week - about 10 times the usual traffic. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm relatively new to open source development. I've always worked in
</I>&gt;<i> environments where you buy the things you need and do whatever you
</I>&gt;<i> like with them within the confines of the office. Hence, I see
</I>&gt;<i> several options for Gtk# integration but I can't seem to find a solid
</I>&gt;<i> statement about what is allowed and what is not. If anyone could add
</I>&gt;<i> options or information to the list below or point me towards a
</I>&gt;<i> readable source of info on this, I'd be very grateful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My options seem to be (in order of best integration):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1 - Somehow add all of Gtk# and Gtk+ to my own project, compile them
</I>&gt;<i> directly into it and put up with maintaining it (ie downloading and
</I>&gt;<i> remodifying new versions as they are released by you guys). This
</I>&gt;<i> would probably involve me having to get Gtk+ to compile as well
</I>&gt;<i> (Linuxy C++, argh!), so I won't be doing this unless it turns out to
</I>&gt;<i> be much easier than it sounds. On the bright side, it should be OK
</I>&gt;<i> provided I ship all that source in my code releases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2 - Rip all necessary DLLs from the Gtk# installer (that would
</I>&gt;<i> include Gtk+ DLLs) from Novell and put them in my bin directory upon
</I>&gt;<i> installation. This is the most attractive option, and should be the
</I>&gt;<i> most reliable option. This would be a pretty flagrant violation of
</I>&gt;<i> copyright (or something) though, wouldn't it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3 - Compile my own DLLs using the Gtk# source code and put them in
</I>&gt;<i> the installer. My understanding is that this would be allowed,
</I>&gt;<i> provided the source for 'my' Gtk# DLLs was available with the rest of
</I>&gt;<i> the code. For the same reasons as #1, this is not an attractive
</I>&gt;<i> option. I could possibly rely on a Gtk+ installer but I think that's
</I>&gt;<i> been part of the problem too, or at the very least has the potential
</I>&gt;<i> to land me in exactly the same situation again later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4 - Keep using Novell's installer, but integrated into mine. This has
</I>&gt;<i> been giving me headaches but only with a few users. I just hate the
</I>&gt;<i> fact that my software may be directly incompatible with other
</I>&gt;<i> software (like Pidgin) because I'm using Gtk#. Installer integration
</I>&gt;<i> would ensure that only users with broken installs had problems, but
</I>&gt;<i> could actually break other people's software!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you can see, I seem to be stuck between options that involve me
</I>&gt;<i> appropriating and working with all of Gtk#'s source code, doing
</I>&gt;<i> things I'm not sure are legal (let alone moral), or creating an
</I>&gt;<i> installer that breaks other software. :-(
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I apologise if everyone is reading this and thinking &quot;well, duh&quot;, but
</I>&gt;<i> as I said I'm new to this and try as I might I can't seem to find a
</I>&gt;<i> clear statement about each of these alternatives or what the hell to
</I>&gt;<i> do about it all, especially as a chump end user of Gtk# on Windows
</I>&gt;<i> who can't compile it for himself. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks in advance for any (more) help you guys can give me,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Aaron.
