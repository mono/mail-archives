<PRE>Hello,

As far as I know, the things you mention are all closely associated
with either System.Drawing, gdiplus, or System.Windows.Forms.  In my
opinion, that means they are all likely to have the same assumptions,
like the Items property or similar idea you mention. That is what I
meant by SWF specific (your architectural guidelines), not that it is
tied to SWF classes.  It would be much more interesting if you could
say, &quot;It works also with Avalon, SWT, AWT, Swing, wxWidgets, QT, but
not Gtk.&quot; if you really intend for it be a cross-toolkit tool.  I
would be happy to find out I am wrong.

So I think someone should be able to add support for what you need,
but I'll have to let others speak on the details of what it will be. 
I agree at least some similar ideas will be needed for a Gtk#
designer.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;MyXAML.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;In any manner, I think that .NET guideline support will have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;priority over this, unless someone takes an active role in doing so,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;it doesn't seem to require too much work.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello all,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have done a cursory review of using GTK# with MyXaml and I've found
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;it to be lacking some basic tennets of XAML-friendly classes.  I've
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;posted the review here:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://myxaml.com/marcclifton/archive/2004/08/15/433.aspx">http://myxaml.com/marcclifton/archive/2004/08/15/433.aspx</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and I'm wondering if the GTK# group has any interest in making GTK#
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;compatible with serializing object graphs into XML using a generic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;parser such as MyXaml.  Personally, I feel that this would be a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;worthwhile endeavor.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
