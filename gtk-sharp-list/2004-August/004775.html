Thank you very much for your diligence and patience. 

You are correct in your assumptions about the GAC.  It is a runtime 
piece and not a compile time one.  This means that there shouldn't be a 
need to constantly redistribute or to keep cloning the Gtk# library 
assembly  modules every where.  If you where working within the 
environment that the Mono Combined installer for Win32 provides, you 
would see our implementation of the GAC working as you understood it.

I am currently doing some research with a new experimental Gtk# and Mono 
installer for Windows that will use GTK 2.4 rather than 2.2 it uses 
today.  The good news is that while the previous Win32 installers that I 
had put out were mostly a repackaging trick, this one will actually use 
Gtk# libraries that I am building from CVS.  This may finally provide 
the fix for the correct interaction with the Microsoft .NET Framework GAC.

Paco
PS
The Combined Mono Win32 Installer that I am working on will be first 
released here:

As I allready mailed to the list, yes the suggestions helped. :)
However since I am not using visual studio, but only the command line tools,
the info from the tutorial was not immediately clear.

The &quot;default namespace&quot; setting of course has no meaning when using the
command line compiler and I must admit I had to think about what &quot;copy
local&quot; meant. Hey, I'm a beginner! :)

But basically it did the trick. All I had to do was copy the gtk# dll's to
the local program directory.
I did remove the /lib lines from the response file and recompiled the
program but it turns out that wasn't even needed...

Next, I took the exe I compiled under monodevelop in linux and copied that
to the directory where I copied the gtk-sharp libs to, and that exe works
also. Which is of course extremely nice. :)

So recompiling is not needed. Since the runtime looks in the local directory
before going to the GAC, it works immediately.

Still curius about how the runtime behaves different with LOCAL and GAC
libs...

Best regards,

Anset.
