<PRE>Hi,

Just to confirm that I was able to solve my problem by copying all the
gtk-shap dlls to the local directory.

If anyone could explain to me why it makes a difference wether I load the
libraries from the GAC or from LOCAL, I would very much appreciate it.
Reading about the .NET framework and all, I was under the impression that
the GAC was nothing more than an ultra-luxurious LIB PATH...

Apparantly the runtime does treat GAC libs differently though...?

Again thanks for the help, I'm a happy camper again. :)

Anset.
