<PRE>I'm a beginner with GTK experimenting with the treeview using Mono 1.0 
and have managed to follow several useful examples to get parts of the 
treeview to respond differently depending on which button was clicked, 
for example to produce a popup menu if and only if mouse button three is 
clicked.

The column headings are a bit different. If I set my headings to be 
clickable and reorderable then it responds very well to the click and 
does what is asked. I don't see any ButtonPressHandlerEvent associated 
with the header, however it is plainly there for the treeview as a whole.

I hesitate to report this as a bug since it might be by design. It seems 
quite valid to have a special set of operations associated with a column 
that could be separate from those operations in a member cell of that 
column.

How to get a column heading to respond to a right click? Thanks for any 
hints here.
