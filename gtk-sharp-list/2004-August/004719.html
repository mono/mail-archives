Heh.

That might work, but the auto close might confuse people.

I think perhaps ending up with the twisty disappearing in the case of no
real children is &quot;OK&quot;, or at least in line with how the equivalent Windows
control does it. Since GNOME seems to want to behave like Windows...

&gt;<i> Or, figure out how to display the disclosure triangles without having

</I>&gt;<i> children.

I suspect it isn't possible, which is annoying.

Incidentally, when I used your code the call to ExpandRow caused recursive
calls to my RowExpanded handler. So I didn't do that :-)

What worked very well was to add the real children *before* removing the
dummy child. I'm hazy on TreeIters, but possibly removing the single dummy
child invalidated the parent's iter somehow, whereas adding the children
first didn't.

Cheers,

Chris
