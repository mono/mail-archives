<PRE>Hello John,

Yes, the default constructors would appear to be trivial, but no it's 
not a deficiency in MyXaml.  As to other MyXaml supported by other 
toolkits, many toolkits by their very nature work well with MyXaml 
because they are implemented so as to support serialization.  In 
particular MyXaml works 100% with VG.net, a vector graphics engine and 
which serializes to MyXaml, and near 100% with other third party 
toolkits such as DevExpress, DevComponents and Infragistics.

There is nothing in the MyXaml core parser that is SWF specific.  What 
is required is only a compliance with some architectural guidelines 
which I have previously written about.  These guidelines aren't 
something that is MyXaml specific but applies to all XAML-like generic 
parsers, and I agree with you, that it doesn't seem like it would take 
too much work.  Doing so would actually be of benefit to GTK#, IMO, 
because it would bring GTK# more in line with the .NET architecture, and 
therefore would satisfy serialization requirements.

As it is now, without writing a custom parser to support GTK# classes, 
properties, methods and events, how would you go about implementing a 
front-end designer, for example?  It seems like by following some simple 
architectural guidelines in GTK#, one could avoid a lot of extra work by 
simplifying current serialization issues.

</I>&gt;<i> Hello all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have done a cursory review of using GTK# with MyXaml and I've found
</I>&gt;<i>it to be lacking some basic tennets of XAML-friendly classes.  I've
</I>&gt;<i>posted the review here:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and I'm wondering if the GTK# group has any interest in making GTK#
</I>&gt;<i>compatible with serializing object graphs into XML using a generic
</I>&gt;<i>parser such as MyXaml.  Personally, I feel that this would be a
</I>&gt;<i>worthwhile endeavor.
