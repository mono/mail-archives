<PRE>Hi all,

  Im running gentoo with mono 1.0.1 and monodevelop 0.5.

  Im pretty new to mono and monodevelop and I have tried the tutorial
that is on the mono website for mono and gtk#.  I reproduced the
tutorial exactly but when I compile it I get two errors for the lines
with [Widget] on them.
According to the compile it was expecting an ';'. There is one at the
end of the line but it does not seem satisfied with that. When I use
the command-line compiler I get some more information about how it got
OPEN_BRACKET but was expecting BOOL, BREAK etc. Seems to me that the
compiler does not allow lines of code that begin with a bracket.

Is this an actual bug or am I doing something wrong?

I have added an entry to the mono bugzilla about it just in case but
just wanted to know if anyone has seen anything similar.

</PRE>
