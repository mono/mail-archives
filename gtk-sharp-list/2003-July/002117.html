<PRE>Hi,

Just some feedback about the 0.10 Win32 installer.

1. Even if Mono is installed, don't install the assemblies to Mono, as =
it becomes (almost) impossible to use GTK# with .NET as System.* =
assemblies get picked up with GTK# ones.
2. libglade is installed in the wrong directory, and is wrongly named =
(should be libglade-2.0-0.dll)
3. GTK# should not include GTK runtime.  Nor should it include a =
preinstalled theme.
4. GTK# should install into an existing GTK Runtime.  This makes the =
most sense, and allows for all the Mono/.NET stuff to be removed from =
the installer.  Changing the theme should ask the user beforehand.  =
Doing this also fixes all the path munging.
5. If Mono is not installed, the default install dir is blank.

I have some patches which address all of these, and have a GTK# 0.10 =
installer for Win32 which has a working libglade, and works beautifully =
with .NET (I am not using mono) (Installer is available at =
<A HREF="http://enactive.org">http://enactive.org</A>)

I am most interested in using GTK# with Glade and .NET, so I may be =
different than most users.

Hope this helps.
Shane
