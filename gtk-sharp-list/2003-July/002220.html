</I>I will attempt to, however, on further testing, the error seems to only
occur when the checkbutton is set Active.

When I start it up and the web service says the checkbutton should be
inactive, it is fine, when I click the checkbutton to activate it, it
dies AFTER letting the web service know, and the web service retains
record of the succesful state change.

However, If i start it up with the checkbox set to Active, it dies with
that same error.

This is not the only place I have been receiving this error. It is also
possible to get it from clicking around. I can't seem to find any
rational explanation other than the mono GC is disposing of the object
before g_object_unref gets to it.
