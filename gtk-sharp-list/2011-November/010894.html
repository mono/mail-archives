<PRE>It's a bit hard to see the image on that thread you posted, but I think I
might have used it to do mine.
(actually in reading the text - I 99% sure I used that exact page :))

Just to confirm - are you wanting to put images etc into your tabs?

Not sure how buttons will work - will run a test shortly, but I have some
code that addes text and an image to my tabs: This code will set a label and
load an image from a resource



You then can use it as follows


firstContainerInPage is the first container object placed in the page for
the tab you want to edit, could be anything from a VBox to another notebook.

Will try get a simple test up and running :)
