<PRE>Sample code added :)

CustomTabLabels.zip 

And I agree with what Slide has said - and looking more closely to the code
he originally posted it should have worked (pretty much the same as mine)

There is really nothing stopping you from making custom interfaces with GTK,
it just comes down to how much work you want to put into each control (for
the cases where the stock controls don't work)

If you are wanting to have this functionality in the GUI designer - I'm not
sure why it's not there, but if it's done in code at runtime it can be done
:<i>)

Hope this helps
