<PRE>Hiya - a friend was asking me about c# and GtkSharp as I'd mentioned it in 
passing, he's wanting to port some of his code ( perl/gtk ) to windows, and 
was wanting to possible switch languages as well, and was thinking of 
c#/mono.

Unfortunately he's using zvt for his terminal processing, which is part of 
gnome and not straight gtk, so wouldn't be available on windows.

Does anyone here have any suggestions for a replacement object?

Thanks
Mark
