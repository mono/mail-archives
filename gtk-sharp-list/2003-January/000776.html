The comments come from the source code to the Gtk version of Zoltan's
coverage tool:

Yes, I agree there.  

&gt;<i> &gt; //  - the generated sources are hard to read because the API functions are

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; //  - the app is slow to start up, slower than Qt#. Afterwards, it is faster.

</I>
We should still dig into this problem and find what is slower.  Multiple
shared libraries?  Multiple assemblies?  Atk/Pango startup time?  gtk
startup time?  The issue might not even be related to the binding.

&gt;<i> I would be wary of an entirely new API (since there will be a new
</I>&gt;<i> filesel, with filters, in Gtk+ 2.4), but it'd be easy to add a few
</I>&gt;<i> static methods that run the fileselector internally:
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i>  public static bool GetFileName (out filename, FileMode mode);
</I>&gt;<i>  public static bool GetFileName (out filename, FileMode mode, string
</I>&gt;<i> suggested, string[] extensions);
</I>&gt;<i>  public static void GetFileNameAsync (FileCallback cb, FileMode mode);
</I>&gt;<i>  public static void GetFileNameAsync (FileCallback cb, FileMode mode,
</I>&gt;<i> string suggested, string[] extensions);
</I>
Yeah, agreed with you.

We could have the filters as a params (like Qt does), and for now just
ignore them.

&gt;<i> What tools did you have in mind? I have some ideas as how to merge in
</I>&gt;<i> gtk-doc sources, but I'd like to hear what you've thought up.
</I>
Well, we have Monodoc which is used to document assemblies from a
&quot;reference&quot; assembly.  The tool is not finished, and needs some
polishing, but it implements what we have discussed in the past in
mono-docs-list.

The browser tool is designed to be like the MS .NET Framework
documentation browser and will cope with merging multiple documentation
trees in a single hierarchy.  I have not finished it, but will check
something this week.

There are certain pieces of the Gtk documentation that can be reused:
most of the explanatory text in it;  But the individual API calls is not
as well documented as the .NET documentation, so I would like to take
this opportunity to improve upon it.
