<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> I'm wondering how (assuming that it's possible) &quot;managed&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> (mono-maintained) data can be added to a Gtk# TreeStore or TreeView.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For example, suppose that you're writing a file manager (Nautilus#?). 
</I>&gt;<i> You don't want to load the entire file system tree all at once.  Rather,
</I>&gt;<i> when a node is selected, at *that* point you want to be able to search
</I>&gt;<i> for child directories/files and add them to the tree view.
</I>
The TreeStore seems to be a &quot;default&quot; implementation of the TreeModel
that the TreeView uses and it uses the Iters are you saw them.  Maybe an
option is to have a more C#-ish model implementation for Gtk#
applications instead of the C-ish mode that we have now.

Anyways, I have not attempted that, but I have a workaround for this
case in the monodoc browser that hooks up to the RowExpanded signal and
tracks the information in a hashtable to be able to populate the tree on
demand.

Miguel
