Well.. I'm not convinced; Ref'ing things that we create is definitely
the wrong thing to do.. however, Ref'ing others I think is correct,
whether it's once and cache, or multiple times and create a new c#
wrapper each time, since, in theory, we shouldn't own any of those refs
unless we explicitly ref them.  And yeah, the gtk api sucks in this
respect.. I think they have pushed for some consistency on this issue in
the past though.

&gt;<i> &gt;   - Ref only the first time we see a particular object pointer, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; store the C# object - return the same c# object for the same glib
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; object.  This would be doable, but tricky to get right -- by storing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; those objects in the hashtable, they'll never get c# finalized, hence
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; never gobject unref'd.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, it's not tricky to get right, and it's what we already do.  In the
</I>&gt;<i> Raw property set code, we insert a hashtable entry to track existing
</I>&gt;<i> wrappers.  In GetObject, we return the wrapper object for a given handle
</I>&gt;<i> if it's in the hash, otherwise we wrap it, which eventually calls the
</I>&gt;<i> GLib.Object(IntPtr) ctor, which sets Raw, which inserts it in the hash,
</I>&gt;<i> yadayada.
</I>
Aye, I missed that.  However, it wasn't working -- for every call to
GetObject, I was getting a new C# wrapper.  The problem (I'm guessing)
here is that in the Raw property it's set as &quot;Objects[value] = this&quot;,
but in GetObject it's accessed as &quot;Objects[(int)handle]&quot;.. the HashCodes
may be different.

&gt;<i> This is easily accomplished via the Gtk.Object(IntPtr) ctor, if needed.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I think the existing Dispose solution is fine. Perhaps the glue
</I>&gt;<i> function should sink instead of unref, though, to avoid the harmless,
</I>&gt;<i> but ugly, warning.
</I>
I looked at doing that; the only problem that I saw was that objects
that are created via the Object(IntPtr) ctor we have to assume that we
already own.  It's the objects that are created via things like
Gtk.Label:Label(string), which just does &quot;Raw = gtk_label_new (str)&quot;. 
The only time we can Ref/Sink is after Raw is assigned to, but we only
need to Ref/Sink if it's a Gtk.Object derivative.  So perhaps we can
override Raw in Gtk.Object to do this.  This would mean, however, that
we can't use &quot;Raw = blah&quot; for the Object(IntPtr) case, since we don't
want to get reffed.

&gt;<i> &gt; instead of just assigning to Raw as they do now.  All objects that are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; returned by get_* or whatever functions should come unreffed -- in this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; case we need to Ref() and create a C# wrapper.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Woah.  Who says that we don't own every ref returned by a get method? If
</I>&gt;<i> that's true, then maybe that helps, but I doubt that is true.  The real
</I>&gt;<i> issue is that the Gtk api is inconsistent in its ref ownership semantics
</I>&gt;<i> and we need to overcome this with a solution that identifies unowned
</I>&gt;<i> references so that we can ref only those. 
</I>
Owen claims that this is the case... the only exceptions, according to
him, are things that are legacy broken and are in deprecated code.

&gt;<i> Based on what I've read so far in this mail, I think the only likely
</I>&gt;<i> result will be the leaking of refs, which we can accomplish by removing
</I>&gt;<i> the Dispose functionality until we can solve the ref ownership
</I>&gt;<i> identification issue.
</I>
I'll post a patch in a bit; unfortunately I'm about to get suckered into
'Real Work' for a while, so won't be able to clean it up for a little
while.

Thanks,
