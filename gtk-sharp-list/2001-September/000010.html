I'm running Beta 2 on a Win2k box.  It built just fine, but it was
actually looking for a file called &quot;gtk-1.3&quot; instead of &quot;gtk-1.3.dll&quot;. 
Copying the file worked fine, but obviously I preferred to have an
extension.

I spoke with Miguel about it briefly, and he had seen the same (that the
&quot;.dll&quot; is not automagically appended) and said that there'll probably
have to be some munging done in the mono runtime so that it'll
substitute &quot;.so&quot; for &quot;.dll&quot; if the latter can't be found.

Ha.  Yes, that would probably explain it.  But c'mon, it's free
software, it's *supposed* to crash!  One nine is good enough for us,
dammit!
