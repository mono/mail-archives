<PRE>The FileSystemModel example is a bad one. I'm very rusty wrt JTree,
but afaics this model *only* works with a custom JTree. The example
model doesn't return instances of TreeNode, so a standard JTree
doesn't work with this model.

Using an hourglass and a &quot;Loading...&quot; node are really implementation
specific. In the GnomeVfs TreeView i coded, performance was pretty
good, negating the need for an hourglass or &quot;Loading...&quot; node.

The example only works as long as JTree initially only queries for the
root nodes and if those are leafs or not. I don't recall offhand how
Gtk does this.

Anyway, is this really something worth taking the time to
discuss/possibly implement? For the GnomeVfs tree, i basically had
something working after half an hour of hacking. Just lookup which
events tells you when a row is expanded and go from there. I can try
and see if i still have this example lying around somewhere.

</I>&gt;<i> The lazy load structure is implemented without any need to look at the
</I>&gt;<i> view. IMHO, this method is easier to reuse (the code for using the model
</I>&gt;<i> is alot easier). Also, we could do some fancy things this way. Imagine we
</I>&gt;<i> have a property in TreeNode
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> protected virtual bool ShouldLoadAsync { get; }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A class could override this to say &quot;hey, I will be slow to load&quot;. The
</I>&gt;<i> person coding the tree view could set a property (or maybe we just do it
</I>&gt;<i> by default) that would cause the hourglass cursor and a new tree node that
</I>&gt;<i> says &quot;loading...' to be created when such nodes are created.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;wait for a listener&quot; model is also messy because non-leaf nodes need
</I>&gt;<i> a dummy child. As a consequence of this, people have two options: they can
</I>&gt;<i> either load all the children of visible nodes. This can hurt performance,
</I>&gt;<i> but is often simpler to implement. For example, monodoc does this. The
</I>&gt;<i> other option is to create a dummy child node. This is messy code wise, but
</I>&gt;<i> helps out performance alot. With the swing model in the above url, one
</I>&gt;<i> does not even need to think about this.
