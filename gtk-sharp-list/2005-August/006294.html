If they are exposed by the bound Gtk+ version, but not by Gtk#, that's a
bug.  Please file it.

Here's how I grade bug-related contributions:

A+ - Bug report in bugzilla with patch
A - Bug report in bugzilla
B - Bug report to mailing list
C - &quot;here's how I worked around that&quot; response to bug report.
F - Figured out a workaround but kept it to yourself.

There's more than one way to contribute to a project.  Bug reporting is
an important one.  Patches are extra credit.  

Please don't think I'm beating up on you.  While my message was a
&quot;reply&quot; to yours, it was intended more as a general message to all the
users out there. You are certainly not the first person that's worked
around a Gtk# bug and not reported the original bug. ;-)

The license for Gtk# does not require you to report a bug when you find
it, but in my opinion, it's a small price to pay.  Let the people who
have time to fix bugs know there's one to fix by reporting it. It may
not get fixed immediately, depending on priorities, but it certainly
won't get fixed if we don't know about it.

&gt;<i> I actually would not mind doing the bugfixes myself, but I don't seem to 
</I>&gt;<i> be able to understand the custom file way of working... I havent been 
</I>&gt;<i> able to find any clear documentation about it.
</I>
Custom files are just C# code that gets appended to a type declaration.
I'm not sure how much documentation I could provide on that.  When
generating type Foo, if a Foo.custom file is detected, the contents are
appended.  There's a blurb to that effect on the GAPI page on the mono
wiki, which is the best source of documentation available, I believe.
Just in case you or others haven't seen it:

<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/GAPI">http://www.mono-project.com/GAPI</A>

I'd be happy to help get you up to speed on fixing it if you want.
Start off with a bug report on the problem and then we can comment on
the bug as far as the best solution.
