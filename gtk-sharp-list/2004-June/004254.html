<PRE>The link to the gtk# windows installer I gave you was originally created
for working in Visual Studio.NET.
I provided directions for Mono.
I haven't tried the directions with vs.net.  Maybe you can ask John Luke
who created the installer.

Did you copy the complete gtk+ runtime (DLLs and non-DLLs)to the root
directory of Mono?

Daniel,

     I tried the TreeViewDemo.exe.  The Tree View window came up, after
all the associated assemblies loaded (took a few seconds).
     It looks like you had no real data associated with the Tree View,
just a certain number of &quot;roots&quot; and &quot;sub-roots&quot;.  Looks nice.

     However, I got the following command console error messages:


F:\Gtk#\sample&gt;mono TreeViewDemo.exe

** (&lt;unknown&gt;:2400): WARNING **: No builtin or dynamically loaded
modules were found. Pango will not work correctly. This probably means
there was an error in the creation of:
  'F:\Mono-Beta3\etc\pango\pango.modules'
You may be able to recreate this file by running pango-querymodules.

F:\Gtk#\sample&gt;pango-querymodules
'pango-querymodules' is not recognized as an internal or external
command, operable program or batch file.

F:\Gtk#\sample&gt;f:\gtk+2\bin\pango-querymodules

F:\Gtk#\sample&gt;mono TreeViewDemo.exe

** (&lt;unknown&gt;:2456): WARNING **: No builtin or dynamically loaded
modules were found. Pango will not work correctly. This probably means
there was an error in the creation of:
  'F:\Mono-Beta3\etc\pango\pango.modules'
You may be able to recreate this file by running pango-querymodules.

F:\Gtk#\sample&gt;

     I likely have misunderstood your install instructions.  Please
refer to my previous email.
     But this is a lot further than I got before.

     Dumb question.  Can I use Visual Studio .NET to edit and compile a
GTK# program?
     I have tried to do this in the past and got a compile, the GTK#
program always failed on method or .dll not found.

Thanks again,
Rick
