<PRE>Hi Chris,

&gt;<i> The /sw prefix is used by Fink. I don't know who built the OS X beta
</I>&gt;<i> package, but as that installs into /opt/local which is where Darwinports
</I>&gt;<i> installs things by default, I'd guess the package came from a Darwinports
</I>&gt;<i> user.
</I>
Yeah.  I tried installing beta3 last night to see if it solved the
problem, and the installer had a DarwinPorts logo.  It also clobbered
by pkg-config, so GTK# wouldn't even configure properly (there was an
option in the installer to install pkg-config, but all it did was set
up a symlink to a non-existent pkg-config in
/Library/Frameworks/Mono.Framework/Commands.  Even when that option is
unchecked, it still did the same thing, btw.

&gt;<i> Mixing bits of Fink with bits of Darwinports is not a good idea. Have you
</I>&gt;<i> any idea why something's looking in /sw when you're trying to run mono
</I>&gt;<i> stuff? (Check your environment variables.) Do you have an
</I>&gt;<i> /opt/local/lib/libgthread*?
</I>
Nope.  The only DarwinPorts stuff I have is the Mono install (on the
Mono site, they recommend using Fink to install the dependencies
anyway, so I'm surprised there's a problem).  I don't have a
libgthread anywhere on my system except for in /sw/lib.

&gt;<i> Have you considered building mono from Fink or DP?
</I>
I had installed it from Fink originally, and it worked great.  But I
(stupidly, apparently) removed it to install the binary package from
the Mono site, figuring it would be better to have the &quot;official&quot;
version installed.  I'd reinstall the version in Fink, but they don't
have beta3 in there yet.

Matt
