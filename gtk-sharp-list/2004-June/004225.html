By versioned .pc files please tell me you consider doing something like:

leaving it alone for now, and when we need to increment the version for 
parallel install purposes, we change to xxxx-sharp-1.2 or 2.0 or 
whatever we end up doing.

There is a lot of documentation/book(s)/etc all over the place now with 
-pkg:gtk-sharp, and having to change that yet again to 
-pkg:gtk-sharp-1.0 for no purpose (as it doesnt provide any more 
versioning) seems to be counter productive.

We already changed everything on everyone a month ago, lets try and only 
do it every other month ;)
