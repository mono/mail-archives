There is a Wiki topic for this:

Daniel, would you mind putting your instruction guide there as a
resource for people?

&gt;<i> Comments:
</I>&gt;<i> Where are the Gtk# tutorials, programming how tos, and programming books?
</I>&gt;<i> I know if you are a C or assembler programmer, then you should be able to
</I>&gt;<i> deduce appropriate function/method usage.
</I>&gt;<i> But for the rest of us, tutorials, examples (many), and books are the way

</I>
We're still working hard on completing the API docs.  As you go through
the learning curve, please please please help us out by integrating the
knowledge into the docs. If you look in the docs for something and it's
not there, when you figure it out, please document it for us.

There are tutorials and books for Gtk+ programming which can be fairly
easily adapted to the Gtk# programming paradigm in the meantime.  Also,
there are several sample applications, including the beginnings of a
GtkDemo port in the sample directory of the gtk-sharp sources.
