<PRE>Hello Brian,

   Thanks for the feedback.  I do not know that there is much that can
be done to monodoc in the short term though, with the freeze coming and
everything.

   Here are some comments.

&gt;<i> I think part of the problem is that monodoc's editing function can be
</I>&gt;<i> frustrating to use. I've experienced the following problems with it:
</I>&gt;<i>  * Ctrl-C doesn't work in edit mode. Select/Middle=click pasting doesn't
</I>&gt;<i>    work too well either.
</I>
I have this on the TODO list already.

&gt;<i>  * If you close before submitting your contributions, it won't recognize
</I>&gt;<i>    the changes (or something, that's as far as I can tell)
</I>
Mhm, it keeps them on the disk, if you upload, it will still send them.

&gt;<i>  * No spell checker.
</I>
Agreed, but not something we can fix right away.

&gt;<i>  * The buttons aren't really clear and not HIGified.
</I>
A patch was commited, but it broke hotkeys, so I have taken it out for
now. 

&gt;<i>  * No explanation that you need to use different letters to reference
</I>&gt;<i>    members, fields, classes, et al.
</I>
www.go-mono.com/documentation.html has some information on this.

&gt;<i>  * No documentation/guidelines as to how documentation should look,
</I>&gt;<i>    sentence structure, brevity, descriptions, et al.
</I>
Agreed.  We need to cook this up, volunteers?

&gt;<i>  * No undo/redo.
</I>
Yup.

&gt;<i>  * Crashed after I submitted contributions the first time. (Is this
</I>&gt;<i>   fixed?)
</I>
It works here, can you try again?

Miguel
