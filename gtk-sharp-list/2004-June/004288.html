<PRE>Kudos:
First, I want to thank Daniel Morgan for his 6 Steps email from 6/20/2004.
It was the BEST explanation that this clueless Windows user has seen.
It allowed me to get both Mono (Beta 3) and GTK# (0.93) installed on
Windows 2K.
It should become part of a ReadMe How To Install On Windows text file, as
long as step 5.b. is corrected (5b. lead me astray for a day).
.
Comments:
Where are the Gtk# tutorials, programming how tos, and programming books?
I know if you are a C or assembler programmer, then you should be able to
deduce appropriate function/method usage.
But for the rest of us, tutorials, examples (many), and books are the way
we learn a new programming paradigm.
.
BTW, I have ordered &quot;Mono Kick Start&quot; from Amazon.com.  It has one (1)
chapter that introduces Gtk# along with Qt#.
FYI, I discoved that there are two (2) new Mono books that are planned for
release sometime soon (this year?).
.
Parting Question:
Is there an installation writeup for Mono and Gtk# on Linux as good as
Daniel Morgan's was for Windows?
My home Linux desktop is Mandrake Linux 9.2, and only have been able to
install a working version of Mono for the CLI (console mode), no Gtk#, no
Windows.Window.Form.
.
Peace, Rick
