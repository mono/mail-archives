<PRE>In the pre-GAC days, you would install gtk#, gtk+, and its dependencies
in Mono's prefix.
I do not know about a Mono and GTK# that use the GAC though.  Maybe
Gonzalo can shed some light?

Hello,
	Gtk# is based on 2.2, so any GTK+ 2.2 runtime (or newer) should
work. The page I linked previously still works for me, even though the
gimp seems to have a server down that contains the rest of its win32
related stuff.
	I have not tested it with mono because of the gacutil
differences and having to install it conditionally (depending on if mono
is present). Maybe it would be easier for someone to just make a
mono+Gtk# installer. Otherwise, things are installed to
$PROGRAMFILES/$COMMONFILES/Gtk#, which should be useable with mono,
correct?
	Perhaps in the next iteration I will include mono support, but I
am focusing on getting it working well with .NET on Windows for various
reasons.
