<PRE>Congrats :)  I'll try to get some docs done, as I have lots of
not-net-connected time for the next week or so; I assume it's OK to
use/copy the C API docs, as appropriate?  I'm also a bit disappointed
that the managed TreeModel bit didn't make it in, though I guess it's
able to stand on its own and be imported into any projects that should
want to use it.

Looking forward to the Gtk 2.4/Gtk future sync :)
