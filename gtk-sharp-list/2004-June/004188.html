<PRE>We have frozen cvs for the 1.0 release.  Only docs changes and serious
non-API-impacting bugfixes will be accepted until after 1.0 goes out the
door.

We are putting an all-points-bulletin out for documentation writers.  If
you like Gtk# and you want it to be an enormous success that the masses
will speak of with awe for millenia to come, join us and write some
docs.

If you are developing a Gtk# app, you have the knowledge we need. If you
don't think you talk perty enough to write docs, write 'em anyway and
we'll shine 'em up for you.

It's a big API and it aint going to document itself.  I just opened
channel #gtk-sharp-docs to act as command central for the documentation
effort.  I'm in here all by myself.  It's lonely.  Come help me. 
Please.
