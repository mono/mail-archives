<PRE>&gt;<i>there are no bindings for all widgets. We plan to add them as people
</I>&gt;<i>need them.
</I>I knew a lot of developers they just take a loot at GTK# and told me 
&quot;not finish yet, can't use!!!&quot;. They don't ask for missing stuff.

&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe i am to early and should wait a little with using this??
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>well, it's been in development for many years now, so no, it's not early
</I>&gt;<i>to use it. It might miss some stuff you need though, so just tell me and
</I>&gt;<i>we'll try to add them as soon as possible.

Ok.
a minimal docu would be good.

Databindings on Widgets.
All of the samples i saw there was just data reading. How to Update a row with 
values?
What about GDA#/GnomeDb# for win32? Until debugging with MonoDevelop is not 
possible and comfortablier i use VisualStudio.

If some parts of my programm will work just let me now how to put this in 
cvs/samples. i think this will be usefull for others.

If these are stupid wishes just let me now.
