IL assemblies are versioned with a major.minor.build.revision numbering
scheme.  When you build against an assembly, a reference to the version
is stored in your application, so that the runtime can load the proper
version from the Global Assembly Cache.  

The GAC can have multiple gtk-sharp assemblies installed distinguished
by signing key, version, and culture.  We will use versioned .pc files
to enable building against the various versions.
