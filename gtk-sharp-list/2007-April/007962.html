<PRE>Hi Mike, Alp.

At 01:31 AM 7/04/2007, you wrote:
&gt;<i>AFAICT, this is only an issue on win32, correct?  I have not heard
</I>&gt;<i>reports of any instability on linux that this &quot;workaround&quot; fixes.  I had

</I>&gt;<i>This works on linux just fine.  But it turns out from talking to Tor

</I>&gt;<i>in that scenario.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So I'm now thinking we need to add the GLib.Thread.Init call as you

</I>&gt;<i>really really really know what they are doing and want to do
</I>&gt;<i>multithreaded drawing.  Otherwise, it is unnecessary overhead for all
</I>&gt;<i>the programs that don't need it.
</I>
As far as I know, being only a Windows user at this point, the issue 
only arises on certain Windows systems. What I'd like to know is what 
the actual issue is. If a non-threadsafe operation is being performed 
and just happens to work on most systems, all it takes is a change in 
architecture or in the Linux kernel for example to break the API on 
those other systems.

 From a purely chump user POV, I don't agree with the idea that it's 
my responsibility to use work-arounds to make an API stable on a 
not-uncommon target platform. I also can't imagine what amount of 
overhead could justify not ensuring this stability when problems are 
occuring with Gtk#'s own sample applications - what I'm saying is 
that if what I'm observing is in fact the norm, the problem is not 
limited to advanced uses of Gtk# or to systems that are particularly unusual.

&gt;<i> &gt; When I originally implemented the GLib.Thread class, I proposed that it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be used automatically in Application.Init(). Mike made the point that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Gtk# is a binding and that there's value in keeping a one-to-one mapping
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the original API to the C# API to ease porting between languages.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It'd be annoying to find out that Gtk# was doing magic behind the scenes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; yet your identical c/pygtk/gtkmm port doesn't work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I don't recall that discussion.  My recollection was being opposed to
</I>&gt;<i>the overhead of performing that initialization indiscriminately for
</I>&gt;<i>applications that did not intend to use it.
</I>
Are you now saying you've changed your mind? And again I'd like to 
know more about what this overhead is - is this something I should be 
programmatically deciding to do or not do based on examination of the 
system I'm running on? Or is this something that can be fixed over 
time in GLib/Gdk themselves?

Thanks in advance for any further info.

Aaron.
