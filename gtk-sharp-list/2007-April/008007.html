<PRE>Hello,

I've got two problems to solve for which I don't find a solution. I just guess 
that both actually have a pretty simple solution of the &quot;uh, why didn't I 
think of that!!&quot; type. :-)

1. I want to render an adress form inside a table but for the case:

Street + House Nr.   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  xxxxx
Postcode + City       xxxxxxx  xxxxxxxxxxxxxx

I'm not getting nice results. I want to have one column with the labels and 
probably only a second for all the Entry fields. But in those two cases I 
need to have some container which allows me to put in two entries which then 
get different sizes. I couldn't find one.

2. About the famous ListStore. ;-)

I want to display a tree of items and for the leaves I need buttons which 
trigger certain actions. Since one part of the action will be to remove the 
corrospondig leaf a RadioButton or ToggleButton cell renderer doesn't really 
help me. What I'd like to have is normal Button with only an image inside. Do 
I have to write my own CellRenderer for this and where can I find 
documentation on this?

Bye David
</PRE>
