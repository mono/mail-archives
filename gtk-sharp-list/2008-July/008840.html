There have been several efforts toward a &quot;data-bound&quot; tree model over
the years.  The archives should have links to fairly recent efforts to
provide databinding for the entire toolkit.  

I would be more interested in including such a data binding than a tree
model specifically written for DataTable.  Although I also think such a
project could easily stand on its own, and might be easier to integrate
into applications than a Gtk# 2.next dependency.
