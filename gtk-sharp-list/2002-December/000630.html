Well, I disagree.  The *Sharp namespaces contain the helper code that is
not specifically wrapping a Gtk+ api element.  Right now, I think the
only interesting classes to Gtk# application developers that fall in the
*Sharp namespace are the EventHandler/Args subclasses.  These are
clearly not exposing Gtk+ api and I think belong in the helper namespace
where they currently live.  The addition of a using declaration is such
a trivial overhead and it is nice to have the separation between
directly mapped API and helper API.

I don't know what the performance issues are for loading one huge
assembly over a partitioned assembly space.  If we're just talking about
a nuisance factor of having to type a bunch of -r arguments into a
makefile, then maybe there are pkgconfig-like solutions available to
produce the refs.

Frankly, there are a lot bigger fish to fry than this kind of code
shuffling.
