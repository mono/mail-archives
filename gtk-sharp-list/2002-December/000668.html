<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> &gt; My first thoughts were just to override some protected method in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ScrolledWindow class to change the size/layout of the scrollbar buttons.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, after examining the generated Gtk.ScrolledWindow source, it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't look like this is/will be possible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This would require overriding a GtkWidget class method, and that is not
</I>&gt;<i> possible yet.  I don't think anyone's come up with a good idea of how to
</I>&gt;<i> do it yet, but it's definitely something we want to do
</I>
It would be interesting to put the options on the table so we can
discuss the different possibilities that we have at our disposal.

Here is a partial idea that is based on a discussion with Dave Camp from
a few days ago.

* The Foundation

        It would be possible to basically for each GObject Type that we
        want to override to create a child object that actually has the
        overwritten methods pointing to C functions that are basically
        stubs that would call the C# universe code.
        
        This would require that every widget/object actually has a
        derivative class where we can &quot;patch&quot; things up:
        
        struct PatchedGtkButton {
        	GtkButton button;
        }
        
        struct PatchedGtkButtonClass {
        	GtkButtonClass klass
        }
        
        ...
        
        patched_gtk_button_class_init ()
        {
        	widget_class-&gt;size_allocate = patched_gtk_widget_size_allocate;
        	...
        	container_class-&gt;add = patched_gtk_container_size_allocate;
        	..
        	button_class-&gt;button_method = patched_gtk_button_method;
        }
        
        Then every one of those methods basically does:
        
        patched_gtk_widget_size_allocate (...)
        {
        	if (PointerCall (arguments))
        		return;
        	(WIDGET_CLASS (object)-&gt;size_allocate)(arguments);
        }

* Problems

        The problem with the above approach is that it would require a
        lot of extra glue code just to be able to override methods.
        
        It is also non-obvious how to handle things in C# like:
        
        public MyWidget : Gtk.Widget  {
        	public override bool SizeAllocate (SizeAllocation s)
        	{
        		base.SizeAllocation (s);
        		s.width += 10;
        		s.height += 20;
        		return true;
        	}
        
        When we call `base.SizeAllocation', how do we make it call the
        right thing?
        
* The optimization.

        One possible optimization that we can do is that most of the
        generated code would stay the same.  What we need to do is call
        a different constructor (possible a generic constructor that
        takes a GType as an argument).
        
        Then we could construct GTypes dynamically with the information
        that would point to a stub routine that would provide patchy
        versions of every one of the virtual methods that we want to
        override.
        
Miguel
