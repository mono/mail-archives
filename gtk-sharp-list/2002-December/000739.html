</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> well, I think the big problem here is that we're getting more and more dependencies into
</I>&gt;<i> gtk# which makes things really complicated for people who're just using gtk# and none of
</I>&gt;<i> these additional libraries.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>all are conditionally built, so I think that shouldn't be a problem. For
packages, just creating separated packages for each extra assembly with
the extra dependencies should be enough.

Of course, I still agree in not having not-general-purpose libs in GTK#.

&gt;<i> This also applies to people who're making binary packages: sure we can create a separate
</I>&gt;<i> binary package for each of these additional libraries, but we're ending up getting a
</I>&gt;<i> really large source package wich must obviously depend on all of them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was already a bit worried as gnome-db was included in gtk#, but didn't say anything
</I>&gt;<i> because I thought that this'd be the last and only one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>heh, gnome-db hasn't been the latest one, there have been a few others
added after gnome-db, such as GConf, GStreamer, AFAIR.

I think, apart from gphoto, which clearly is a special case, the current
libs in GTK# make a lot of sense, since they offer a complete framework
for GNOME# apps. Maybe, it should be reanamed to GNOME# ? :-)

cheers
