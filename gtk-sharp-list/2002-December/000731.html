Hi,

well, I think the big problem here is that we're getting more and more dependencies into
gtk# which makes things really complicated for people who're just using gtk# and none of
these additional libraries.

This also applies to people who're making binary packages: sure we can create a separate
binary package for each of these additional libraries, but we're ending up getting a
really large source package wich must obviously depend on all of them.

I was already a bit worried as gnome-db was included in gtk#, but didn't say anything
because I thought that this'd be the last and only one.
