Hmmm, it might be worth seeing if the scrollbar button size is
themeable.  That would be a lot easier than writing a custom widget.

This would require overriding a GtkWidget class method, and that is not
possible yet.  I don't think anyone's come up with a good idea of how to
do it yet, but it's definitely something we want to do

&gt;<i> If not, will I need to go and read up on writing Gtk widgets in C, in

</I>
This is, of course an option.  A custom widget could be wrapped using
the Gtk# code generator/parser.  However, in the long run, the goal is
to be able to do Widget Subclassing directly with Gtk#.
