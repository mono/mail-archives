No, unfortunately it is not.  (There's other stuff in the Red Hat 
version that I would like to see on the Mandrake one too... but
they're not there either.  GStreamer would be nice.)

The problem I am getting is that Gtk# needs a newer version of Gtk+2.
What I have is version 1.3.13.  But what it needs is version 2.0.0
or greater.

I ALMOST had success, because I found a bunch of RPMs for GNOME 2
on the Mandrake Club.  However, the author of these packages
did not upload all of them.  And because of that, I was not able
to install a newer version of Gtk+2.

I'm starting to get the feeling that just upgrading to Mandrake 9.0
will be the easiest path... since another patron of this mailing
list [privately] e-mailed me, confirming that they have Gtk# &amp; Mono
running on Mandrake 9.0.


See ya
