<PRE>Hello!

&gt;<i> Well, I disagree.  The *Sharp namespaces contain the helper code that is
</I>&gt;<i> not specifically wrapping a Gtk+ api element.  Right now, I think the
</I>&gt;<i> only interesting classes to Gtk# application developers that fall in the
</I>&gt;<i> *Sharp namespace are the EventHandler/Args subclasses.  These are
</I>&gt;<i> clearly not exposing Gtk+ api and I think belong in the helper namespace
</I>&gt;<i> where they currently live.  The addition of a using declaration is such
</I>&gt;<i> a trivial overhead and it is nice to have the separation between
</I>&gt;<i> directly mapped API and helper API.
</I>
I guess my unrest comes from the fact that it is not obvious when the
&quot;GtkSharp&quot; is needed, so code that looks perfectly fine will be missing
a &quot;using GtkSharp&quot; for apparently no good reason.

If the GtkSharp namespace contained only support code, or code that was
hidden, I would not particularly mind it, but today it is kind of
inconvenient to have it.

Today we do not even have a clear separation between the directly mapped
API and the helper API (and I am very grateful that we do not have this
distinction).  This is mostly obvious in the .custom extensions to the
classes.  I do not quite follow why it is fine to have the .custom files
and not the event arguments (which are hard to type anyways, so they
wont get confused by mistake). 

Anyways, I can live with this, but it sounds like Gtk# could be more
friendly to newcomers.

Miguel
