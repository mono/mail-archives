<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Since a few days I am learning how to make and build applications with
</I>&gt;<i> GtkSharp. I have seen that for building these little applications I need
</I>&gt;<i> to provide reference to the assemblies and in the source code I need to
</I>&gt;<i> declare the use of Gtk and GtkSharp, I think that with only one
</I>&gt;<i> namespace included could be better. Other thing that I have to remark is
</I>&gt;<i> that the name of the assemblies are not the same as the namespaces.
</I>
I also would like to see the *Sharp namespace variants go away, I am not
sure what they are used for, but it would be easier to have everything
on the toplevel space.

About your other question: assemblies can contain code for an arbitrary
number of namespaces.  They are just deployment units (in fact, maybe we
should bundle a few of our existing assemblies together, like
gdk-sharp.dll and gtk-sharp.dll)
