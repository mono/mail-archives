<PRE>Hello,

I hope this message does not come off as sounding like a
&quot;nag&quot;.  Because that is not the intent.  I'm just curious.

What I'd like to know is if there is an ETA for when RPMs
for Gtk# are expected.

The reason I ask is because... it's one thing for me, the
developer to install things from tarballs, etc.  But for
clients (and other end users), who are even uncomfortable
with RPM instillations, having to have them go to
the command line, and do anything is &quot;unthinkable&quot;.
For them, a set of RPMs (or whatever the distro
is using) is a necessity.

It is my hope that (in the short term) there emerges a
nice package of RPMs for Mono and Gtk# that &quot;just works&quot;. 
The appropriate people to do this would be, IMO, Ximian
with Red Carpet; and each Linux distribution maker -- Mandrake,
Red Hat, SuSE, Debian, Gentoo, etc etc.  Since they are the
ones making the &quot;system libraries&quot;.  So... does anyone know
of Ximian's, Red Hat's, SuSE's, Debian's, Gentoo's, etc, plans
on this???

I know I am probably asking a bit early... but I was just
curious as to when this was expected.  Since deploying
any application written using Gtk# and Mono would have
to wait for that too.

Thanks.


See ya
