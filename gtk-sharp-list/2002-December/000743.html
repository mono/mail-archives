Yeah, but you still get a source package which depends on them all.

&gt;<i> Of course, I still agree in not having not-general-purpose libs in GTK#.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This also applies to people who're making binary packages: sure we can create a separate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; binary package for each of these additional libraries, but we're ending up getting a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; really large source package wich must obviously depend on all of them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I was already a bit worried as gnome-db was included in gtk#, but didn't say anything
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because I thought that this'd be the last and only one.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> heh, gnome-db hasn't been the latest one, there have been a few others
</I>&gt;<i> added after gnome-db, such as GConf, GStreamer, AFAIR.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think, apart from gphoto, which clearly is a special case, the current
</I>&gt;<i> libs in GTK# make a lot of sense, since they offer a complete framework
</I>&gt;<i> for GNOME# apps. Maybe, it should be reanamed to GNOME# ? :-)
</I>
Well, I think it'd make sense to have all these GNOME libs in a separate package GNOME#
where gtk# is just gtk+ and the generator.  This may also help people on windows since
gtk# alone works on windows but all these GNOME libs do not, so people who want to have
their applications work on both platforms would use gtk#, but not GNOME#.
