I'd rather they were tamed first, but I'll agree they should be widely
available.  :)

I'm leaning towards inclusion of gnome platform libraries only.  The
only current libs that don't meet the criteria are gda and gnomedb, but
I think they should be left in the binding since they are already there.

Now, everyone please resist the urge to hit that reply button and
suggest that the project be renamed Gnome#, or separated into two
projects, or whatever else.  I am not interested in making additional
work for myself and for all the users and packagers of the binding just
to satisfy conventional expectations of what things should be named. 

Yes, Gtk# is a shitty name for what the project has evolved into.  No,
I've heard no compelling technical argument for separation / renaming.
