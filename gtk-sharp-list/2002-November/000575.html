<PRE>Hi,

Although I have been playing with Linux for over six months I have not had a
need to compile anything.  So working with GTK# is more than a little over
my head.  I read the readme doc but it does not explain what I am doing
(just to configure,make,make install).  If anybody could suggest a web doc
that explained what I am doing when I &quot;configure&quot;, &quot;make&quot;, and &quot;make
install&quot; it would be very helpful.

Anyway I'm getting the following error when I run &quot;configure&quot;:
&quot;can not find install-sh or install.sh in . ./.. ./../..&quot;

I uncompressed the GTK# in &quot;/home/johnf/Mono/gtk-sharp-0.5&quot;  and I have the
Mono &quot;mcs&quot;,&quot;mono&quot;, and &quot;mint&quot; working ok (at least for console programs). My
guess is that it may have something to do with PATH or some other
environment variable.  The directory does contain the file install-sh which
is a link to something  in &quot;/usr/share/automake/install-sh&quot;.  So you can see
that I am lost.

I'm using Red Hat 8.0.
It appears that I have GTK+ (I don't know what version -how does one find
out the version?).

TIA

John Fabiani
