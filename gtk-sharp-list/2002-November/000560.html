<PRE>&gt;<i> Vlad, as long as all the samples still run with this in place, please
</I>&gt;<i> commit.  Thanks for the patch.  Also, can you merge up and commit your
</I>&gt;<i> ref handling patch.  Sorry it took so long to get back to you on that
</I>&gt;<i> one.
</I>
Got them both comitted now; just did a clean checkout and everything
still seems to build, and samples + mphoto run.  I guess that's as
good a test as any :)

There are still a few outstanding problems to be resolved, esp. wrt
the struct changes -- for one, SomeStruct.Zero when passed in to a
function should get marshalled to IntPtr.Zero.  I think the number of
times this comes up in gdk/gtk is fairly small though, so it may be a
non-issue.  However, to solve it correctly would probably require
turning the current structs into internal structs, and providing a
wrapper class just like normal Gtk objects, with a Raw pointer that
gets PtrToStruct/StructToPtr'ized as appropriate.  This would allow us
to attach any metadata that we need to structs, which we can't
currently do.

I committed the ref handling stuff as well; this is probably going to
need more long-term testing, but at the very least any stuff that
was crashing before shouldn't do so now.

I'll be watching bugzilla and the lists closely for anything that I
may have broken :)
