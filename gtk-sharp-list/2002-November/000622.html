successful result, but with most of the job already done, so it should
be really easy to complete the missing %.

For libgnomedb, it should be a really easy work, since most libgnomedb
are just GTK widgets. It would be just a matter of disabling the (few)
bonobo bits (which really shouldn't be public, since they are for
gnome-db/mergeant internals, not for public use) and leave the native
GTK stuff.

As for libgda, needed for libgnomedb, it currently compiles and should
work straight away on win32. It's only missing somebody putting a little
effort on resolving the few missing things (mainly, AFAIR, the DLL
naming differences). But many people have been able to compile it.

As I said, it's not a hard work to have libgda/libgnomedb on win32, but
we need somebody with a win32 machine to put some effort on it :-)

cheers
