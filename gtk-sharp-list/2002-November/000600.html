gda provides a unified interface that's used by one of the Mono ADO.NET
providers; gda in turn exposes a number of different backends through
its interface.  However, native C#/.NET providers are being written
quickly for most databases; I would suggest using those if possible
(currently existing or in progress are ones for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL
Sever, Sybase, SQLite, and I think Oracle.. this list could be off
though).

Dan Morgan, who is also doing a lot of the ADO.NET work, is working on a
number of classes that provide data-bound controls using gtk-sharp, by
using the native ADO.NET interfaces instead of gda/gnome-sharp... he can
possibly give you more information on that, although I don't know how
far he is in this work.
