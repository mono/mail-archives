There are several issues with running on windows still.  

First, Gtk2 has not reached stable release status on windows. I'm not
sure how much of it even works there yet. 

Second, it appears that we will need MSVC compiled dll's in order for
PInvoke to work with the MS runtime. Nobody has stepped up to provide
MSVC binaries yet.  It may be possible to use gcc+libtool created dll's
with the mono runtime on win32, but they may need to be built with the
same gcc (cygwin vs mingw).

Third, we will need to implement platform specific library naming for
the PInvoke mechanism.  There are a couple of approaches possible here,
but until the first and second hurdles are crossed, it will remain low
on my priority list.  I welcome anyone else to take this on though.

Finally, we will need a build mechanism for the glue library on win32. I
am currently excluding it from the build on win32 and it will be subject
to the same PInvokability concerns as the base gtk2 libraries.

If you or any of the other windows folks on the list would like to help
out with any of the above issues, that would be great. I am currently
building the binding on windows, but running it on linux for my
development environment.
