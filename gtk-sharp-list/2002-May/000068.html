<PRE>More eyecandy:

<A HREF="http://gtk-sharp.sf.net/menu.png">http://gtk-sharp.sf.net/menu.png</A>

A little demonstration of box packing and menu support. Couldn't get
screenshooter to activate while the menu was expanded, but take my word
for it, the File::Exit menuitem closes the app cleanly.

I also revamped the build system a bit, and finally finished the GValue
binding.  The customization framework is in place now on the code
generator, so that .custom files are appended to the class definitions. 

The linux build is still failing.  Although it's now failing up in atk,
which is two levels higher in the dependency tree than my last report. 
Most of this progress is due to the GValue work, which eliminated a lot
of method overloading in GObject that was previously stopping the build.

Anyway.  I'll keep writing samples, and tuning the C# customizations.
And filing mcs bug reports.  :)

Mike
