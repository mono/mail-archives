The reason I have not added glue to the build on windows is that I
believe it is going to have to be built with MSVC to be usable with the
MS runtime, and I'm reluctant to add that dependency.

Back before I added the glue library, I was testing on win32 with some
old MSVC built gtk+ dlls and with tml's gcc+libtool binaries.  Based on
this testing, it appears that the ms runtime's pinvoke doesn't play well
with gcc+libtool dll's.  I never successfully pinvoked into a libtool
produced dll.  MSVC dll's worked fine, of course, but I haven't found
anyone willing to produce current MSVC built gtk+ binaries for the
project yet.

If anyone wants to step up and take this on, that would be great.  I'd
love to publish MSVC built gtk+ binaries on the gtk-sharp download page
for windows users.  Alternatively, if any uberhackers want to figure out
why the ms runtime chokes on libtool binaries, that would be even
better.
