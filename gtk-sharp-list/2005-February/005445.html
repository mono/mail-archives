For an immediate solution, I'm in favor of a patch where Glade# will
handle GtkImage and GtkToolButton on it's own.  It can remove whatever
is needed to stop the widgets from loading the images while libglade
constructs them, and then, after libglade has done it's magic, Glade#
can throw the embedded resources into them on it's own.  GtkImage and
GtkToolButton seem to the only base Gtk+ widgets that would need to be
changed.  My only concern is that this could, potentially, cause
problems for people who actually want to use an external pixmap of the
same name as an embedded resource.

A long term solution, I'm thinking, would be an addition to the Glade
XML format (plus a tiny Glade designer hack?) and some collaboration
with the libglade guys.

Reimplementing Glade# would certainly score points with me for being
cool, but... well, I'm just too damn lazy.  :-)  Besides, that's duped
code, and the Catch-Up Game would have to be played with libglade all
the time.  libglade is a nice library; I say we use it.  It just needs a
little fixing up.

Glade 3.0 is being hacked away on, from what I hear, and is what
MonoDevelop is going to use.  I'm thinking that makes this a good time
to get a long term solution in for Glade 3.0 and Glade# 2.something.

Any other ideas?
