First of all thanks are in order to roel and Jonathan Pryor for their  
answers to my earlier question (&quot;Very newbie question about installing  
gtk# on Mac OSX 10.3.8&quot;).

Anyway...

I can't start up Gtk#.

I have installed Mono downlaoded from  
<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.4/macos/MonoFramework-1.1.4.dmg.">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.4/macos/MonoFramework-1.1.4.dmg.</A> (It  
installs version 1.0.5)

I have changed my shell to bash, removed the old installation of fink  
and made a fresh installation, updated to CVS, updated to unstable,  
selfupdated,  indexed, and installed all of the remaining packages via  
fink (copy/pasted the part form the instructions on  
&quot;<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/using/macos.html"">http://www.mono-project.com/using/macos.html&quot;</A> into the Terminal).

I entered: &quot;export  
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/sw/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/X11R6/lib/pkgconfig&quot; in Terminal  
and pressed return. I used env in Terminal to check for a result, and  
lo and behold, the PKG_CONFIG_PATH was there.

I entered &quot;PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH&quot; in Terminal and pressed return. I used  
env in Terminal to check for a result, but nothing was changed that I  
could see. My PATH still says:

PATH=/sw/bin:/sw/sbin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/X11R6/bin

(Although to tell the truth, I have no idea a change would be evident  
with 'env'...)

I have downloaded 'Gtk# 1.0.6' from  
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/downloads/index.html.">http://www.mono-project.com/downloads/index.html.</A> I put it on m  
desktop, extracted the archive, navigated to it in the Terminal and  
entered the following

./configure --prefix=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/1.0.5

(Notice the difference in version number from the instructions on  
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/using/macos.html.">http://www.mono-project.com/using/macos.html.</A>)

It did something without returning a lot of error messages. I rejoiced.
I then did 'make' the same place. Again it did something without  
returning a lot of error messages. I rejoiced!
Then I did 'make install', and again it did something without returning  
a lot of error messages, almost bringing tears in my eyes!

Lastly I entered  
&quot;DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/sw/lib:/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/ 
1.0.5/lib/&quot; in Terminal (notice the DYLD, not DYLIB, and the presumably  
correct version number for mono).

I was all set. Onwards to glory!

Now, where do I double-click...?

I was under the impression, that all of this would install some sort of  
executable that I could either   A)   double-click, like for instance  
'xgalaga' downloaded with fink, which opens in X11 when double-clicked,  
   B)   double-click like any other application in OSX (fat chance...),  
or   C)   open with a command of some sort, like &quot;./gtk-sharp&quot; in  
Terminal.

How does this work?


Sincerely,

Jens Larsen
