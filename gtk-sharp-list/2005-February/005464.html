<PRE>Hi,

I've been playing with C# and Mono Windows and everything seems to work great. Then, I noticed that none of the Gnome libraries are available on Windows.

So, I've tried to build the libgnomecanvas support and it seems to work pretty well. The CanvasDemo.cs works but my application that is using the new Gtk# 2 seems to have some problems with the Item.Destroy(). I guess it is some problem between the different libraries.

Given the above, are there any plans to include at least some of the Gnome libraries on Windows, like libgnomecanvas and maybe a few other than can compile without a problem?

Thanks,

Francisco
