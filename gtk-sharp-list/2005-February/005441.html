<PRE>Hi!

I posted this email already to mono-devel but did not get a lot of
response. And unfortunately I still have the i18n problem to solve.

I am trying to find out what is the best way to internationalize my mono
programs. The goal is to have a portable way which works on Linux and
Windows and can translate strings and widgets loaded from glade files.

I unfortunately could not find a good solution yet but I started to
write the different possibilities down. The page will be extended
whenever I get new information. My goal is also to write a small sample
application for each of the approaches and to test them on each platform
to verify my claims of what works and what not.

 <A HREF="http://www.rtfs.org/ext/files/mono_i18n.html">http://www.rtfs.org/ext/files/mono_i18n.html</A>

The ideal solution would be to have a way which works &quot;out of the box&quot;
on windows and linux (macosx too of course).
This probably would require that an additional library must be shipped
with the mono distribution. But I think hassle free i18n is a very
important aspect for gtk# cross platform applications.

Please write me if you have any idea or comment.

Thanks a lot, Fabian
