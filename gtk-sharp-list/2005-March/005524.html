</I>&gt;&gt;<i> .glade file?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>No, theres no particular reason that you *have* to put all the

</I>&gt;<i>advantages only in maintainability and readability.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Glade's &quot;root element&quot; is any Dialog or Window specified in the glade
</I>&gt;<i>file.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but you can connect only one
</I>&gt;<i>glade root element to any given class by using the Glade.XML.Autoconnect
</I>&gt;<i>method, or you can optionally index the Glade.XML array to get widgets.
</I>&gt;<i>

This should remind you of the office, but you are (somewhat) wrong. ;)

In the newest gtk# versions (both 2.0 and 1.0) (however i am not sure if
either is in a released version), this 'bug' has been fixed, so that
multiple BindFields/Autoconnects only set the fields to valid (non-null)
values. However, if you have a widget named the same thing in two
dialogs, and only one attributed widget, it will refer to the latest
BindFields/Autoconnect.
