<PRE>Hi,

There are two different concepts you look to be confusing. Knowing to
program is a basic concept. You need to understand some concepts, some
procedures and logic. For instance one of the most important concepts to
learn to start with C# is objects/object-oriented-programming. Yet if
you know the main things you can learn any language.

Now, the second thing, knowing APIs. Java has its own, .Net world have
its, C/C++ its.... etc... Yet, using some techniques you can reuse one
from each others.

When you talk about GTK you are talking about a C/C++ API that is
exposed to .NET/mono by GTK# (this is called binding). After you know
GTK you'll know it in C, C++, Python, C#, VB.NET, etc... - the base is
the same, always adapted to the language &quot;details&quot;.

The best way to learn GTK, as any other API you wish to, you'll need to
start by getting the main concepts about it. Read examples, you don't
always need tutorials or step-by-step guides, if you browse inside gtk-
sharp directories you'll find lots of examples. Start by running them,
then try to understand - use monodoc to read what &quot;that-thing&quot; does -
then try to change the examples to see if you really understand them.
Finally you'll know already a lot, use monodoc, and try to reproduce by
your own the example or create a new app - simple things like a text
editor.

Voila, you are learn to program and to know GTK#.
