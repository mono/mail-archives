<PRE>Ok, this is probably just a stupid newbie question since I just got 
started playing with Glade, but here it goes. Could someone tell me if 
this is a bad approach for using Glade. I created a Glade project and 
put multiple windows in the same project. Only one of them isn't a modal 
dialog box now, but they are all in the same project. Will having all of 
those in the same .glade file affect my ability to create a controller 
object for each of them that implements the functionality for them? The 
reason I ask is that I am a little bit confused about how Glade.XML 
defines what is a &quot;root element.&quot; Should I put each dialog in a separate 
.glade file?

I have a lot of experience with Swing and a little bit of experience 
with Cocoa on OSX, so basic MVC is not the issue here. I am just 
confused about how the Glade XML format handles all of the windows that 
are put into a project by the GUI builder.
