</I>

Um. FileSelection is gtk+ 2.2 api, use FileChooserDialog for the 2.4
api. And as far as a directoryname property, you get a filename. i dont
see how converting between them is that hard.

Look at the response value from Run. It gives you everything you need
for return results.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>*TreeView and the MVC pattern: I love the extensibility of the MVC
</I>&gt;<i>pattern as it applies to the TreeView control, don't get me wrong,
</I>&gt;<i>but, oooh... ... ...has anyone considered, say, a *simplier* way of
</I>&gt;<i>creating The Usual Suspects--you know, combo boxes, listboxes, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>Prefabs, in other words, that wrap the TreeView's MVC architecture but
</I>&gt;<i>expose a simplier, faster method of getting things done?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Sometimes, I just want a listbox.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
NodeStore


&gt;<i>*GTK 2.4 vs GTK 2.6--does GTK# 2.0 intend on using GTK 2.6 and its
</I>&gt;<i>file selection dialogs? The ones we have now are kind of... I guess,
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;disconcerting&quot; to look at and interact with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
GTK 2.4 introduced the FileChooser stuff, not GTK 2.6, so I dont quite
think your question makes sense.

&gt;<i>*Are we supposed to be able to inherit CellRenderer? I tried it once,
</I>&gt;<i>but I got a strange &quot;binary format&quot; exception (can't quite remember
</I>&gt;<i>the wording). Are there any examples of how to inherit and implement
</I>&gt;<i>CellRenderer available?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, gtk-sharp/sample/ has one.
