<PRE>I have put together an application that I am hopping to put under Novell 
Forge in the weeks to come.

I did not use Glade to design the UI.  I didn't because I was afraid of 
relaying on features that may not port well in the GTK# implementation 
for MS Windows.

I have not been able to come across any instructional documentation 
and/or sample that describes how to create Accelerators for menu items 
(for example: Ctrl+S to do a Save from the File menu)

A very distinguished member of the Mono development community had 
mentioned that there might have been an earlier posting in this mailing 
list that may even include an example!  Unfortunately, I only recently 
joined this list and I can't seem to find such posting.

Any help (aka bone) you throw my way would be greatly appreciated.

Paco
