<PRE>Hi,

My first post to the list.  Having read the article, his concerns with
Mono seem to be unrelated to any technical issues.

1) &quot;Many interesting class libraries are clearly encumbered by Microsoft
IP and nobody concerned about legal liability will want to ship them. The
core may also be encumbered, though that remains uncertain.&quot;

2) &quot;Aside from IP issues, Microsoft controls the .NET platform.&quot; and
&quot;...no momentum or standards body exists to drive it to completion in an
open manner.&quot;

I assume that Novell is working through all the legal issues.  The other
issue is a valid one.  Perhaps Mono should make their own submission to
ECMA -- alternate APIs to the non-ECMA APIs Microsoft kept to themselves.
 It would be funny if Mono's alternate APIs were accepted as part of the
standard, and Microsoft found themselves out-of-compliance with their own
platform.  :-)  It could be problematic if it turns out that ECMA isn't
will to work with anyone except Microsoft.
