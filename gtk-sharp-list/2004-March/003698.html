The separation has to do with API-stability, not timing. But I am
willing to talk about this if you can get in-sync with GNOME 2.7. But if
you can not then it's not worth discussing.

I hope you manage it for 2.next. As a first step it would have helped
you to do regular release according to the 2.5 schedule, as planned. I
encourage you to do that for 2.7.

Thanks for the clear reply.
