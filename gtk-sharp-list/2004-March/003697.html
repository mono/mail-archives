Congratulations to you and the other binding maintainers.

Unfortunately, this doesn't look possible.    We are locked into the
Gnome-2.2 platform through June, our anticipated first stable release. 
I don't think it will take much effort to update to the 2.7 API, but I
can't afford any distractions from the 2.2 API until it's released.  I'm
pretty much certain at this point that I won't be tracking 2.7 in
mid-April.

&gt;<i> Bindings should follow these rules:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://developer.gnome.org/dotplan/bindings/rules.html">http://developer.gnome.org/dotplan/bindings/rules.html</A>
</I>
I also have not been convinced of the need to fragment the binding
between Platform and Desktop libraries.  As I'm not willing to do this,
apparently the timing issue is moot anyway.

As a project, GNOME releases the Platform and Desktop package sets
simultaneously.  The two package sets are atomic enough for me to target
Gtk# against, and it's easier for me and my users to deal with one
package instead of two. That's what I plan to continue doing at this
point.

&gt;<i> The 2.7 schedue will be like this
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.5/bindings/">http://www.gnome.org/start/2.5/bindings/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> but will more closely match the regular 2.7 GNOME schedule.
</I>
My plan is still to jump to 2.7 tarball versions as soon as I get 2.2
out.  I will probably try to match your schedule once I get the API
transition done.
