<PRE>I sent a patch in a couple days ago for the Accel.xml
file, basically just migrated the Gtk+ api doc over,
no fancy-pants examples or anything really astounding.

But I noticed that Some of the Accel*cs stuff seems a
little mixed up and I was wondering if someone here
could explain why.

First I noticed that not all of the Accel*cs files are
in the Gtk.Accel class, some of them are just directly
in &quot;Gtk&quot; namespace.
Also some of the Accel*cs files only contain a single
method, that seems a bit strange too. And it appears
that the xml files for those pages don't get rendered
properly.

What should we do about this. Im happy to finish
moving the Gtk+ api docs over for the Accel stuff and
then writting an example and then moving on to other
areas that need the api docs moved over but I would
like to know what the deal is with the Accel stuff
first if thats possible.

Thanks,
Alex Combas &quot;sabmoc&quot;@irc.gnome.org#mono
