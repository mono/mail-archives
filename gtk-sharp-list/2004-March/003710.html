<PRE>Within the past few days I've been having the problem that the *glue 
libraries are suddenly being suffixed with .so on OS X.  However, the 
shared libraries in mono are being suffixed with .dylib, as they should 
be.  I've recently updated many of my packages in fink to their latest 
version.  However, since it does not seem to effect other packages, I 
am skeptical that it is being caused by faulty auto* tools.

Can anyone duplicate this?
