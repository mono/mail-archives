<PRE>Hello everyone,

I'm trying to revive Tomboy note-taking app [1] development and work on 
some of the existing bugs.

Among those is the one [2, 3] for text formatting not being preserved on 
Windows, when copy-pasting the text from a note to other programs. On 
Linux it all works fine. On Windows, changing encoding in the serializer 
function reportedly helps, but I can't even test it as it's never called.

Debugging it I see that on Windows the function being succefully 
registered as Gtk.TextBufferSerializeFunc, is never getting called upon 
copy-paste, unlike on Linux. I've tried to understand the flow of it 
being called in response to the copy-paste action, but I wasn't able to 
build the gtk-sharp project from the 2.12 branch using Visual Studio 
2015 and as long as the respective file is listed as &quot;generated&quot; there, 
I can't check what logic GTK# uses to invoke the registered callback.

I'm currently confined to GTK+ 2.24.10 (as I couldn't find any newer 
GTK2 Win installers available, which could be used with Tomboy) and GTK# 
2.12.38 (.42 seems to don't like Mono.Addins version currently bundled, 
which is something I've added to my ToDo list).

Could you please help me understand how the callback is being called and 
how I could possibly debug the abovementioned lack of a call?

regards,
Alex
