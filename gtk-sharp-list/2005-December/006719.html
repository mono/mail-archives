</I>

Well, it can be a repository of *independent* widgets in the SVN and as a
table on the web site so the
everyone can download them but probably having everythin in one library
could be also not so bad, just grab
the last binary release of it and use :). .. Like use log4net.dll,
nhibernate.dll, etc. If you need to take a source and extend it -
then probably it is better to put an effort to extend original control in
the library.

Gwl.Controls/                - only control-type widgets here (shall all
controls be derived from something like Control.cs?)
    DataGrid.cs
    DataGridColumn.cs
    DataGridChangeEventArgs.cs
    ...
    TreeView.cs
    ...
    Plot.cs                   -  i.e. Gtk# widget as a wrapper of NPlot
    PlotSurface.cs
    ...

Gwl.Docking/              - more complex/higher level (controls manager)
    DockManager.cs
    DockContent.cs
     ...
Gwl.Workflow/            - commands, tasks, events, etc. (base library to be
use in final applications).
    Command.cs
    CommandAttribute.cs
    CommandExecuteEvent.cs  - Executed / Executing events for the command.
    CommandManager.cs
    ...

Just some brainstorming, any other ideas? (About suggested Gwl name .... by
the way, it is similar to Gtk, also abbreviation ;))  but I don't insist.

But a repository of available widgets for the beggining would be also very
nice for the beggining and then it would be possible to make design of the
common
library.

And a few more suggestions:

1. do *not* include there a widgets which are already available for Gtk and
well maintained by someone (if it is forgotten - then probably yes :)).

2. if there is some very nice widget/library which has lack of Gtk# wrapper
- this wrapper also could be a target to be included (NPlot, ZedGraph,
Netron, etc.
but named as Diagram, DrawingCanvas, ... so that everything will be easy).

3. if it is not a control - don't put it in Controls folder, ... probably
add there something like Utils for all comon helper classes or make a
separate folder.

4. don't make more levels in the directory tree so that everything will be
very clean.

5. maintain all controls and libraries so that they will be independent
(could be grabbed as a set os sources and used separately).

I would target a library as &quot;Gtk# Widgets Library is a library which extends
standard Gtk# widgets set by a higher level set of controls and utilities
required to build a high quality user interface desktop applications. The
controls of the library are either constructed as a customization of the
available Gtk# widgets but are wrapped to be more consistent and
developer-friendly for use in .NET applications development. The library
also aggregation some free third-party controls which lack implementation
for the Gtk# but are needed by the community.&quot; :)  sorry, I'm not a native
wneglish speaking, probably some mistakes.

Another need to build something like this library could be the fact that
Gtk# sticks too much to the Gtk+ interfaces (which is maybe very good so
that it is easy to use it by people who have experience with Gtk and also to
maintain when something is changing in Gtk+).
