<PRE>Hi,

2005/12/15, Gennadiy Donchyts &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/gtk-sharp-list">don at env.com.ua</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Hi Todd,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for a lot of clarifications :).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On 12/15/05, Todd Berman &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/gtk-sharp-list">tberman at off.net</A>&gt; wrote:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Holy Crap.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ok.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Give me second while I wade in here with the clue-bat.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; #1) MD is not strictly GPL.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; #2) MD is strictly GPL #D code and MIT X11 new code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is it possible to go from GPL =&gt; MIT X11 ... or you consider it as just
</I>&gt;<i> completely different?
</I>
It is possible for you to turn from MS EUL =&gt; PD, provided that you
are Microsoft.

&gt;<i> &gt; #3) The dock is based on an GPL library, that can be relicensed to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MIT X11 for us. (Jeroen, if I am wrong, feel free to beat me). In fact,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we should hunt this down and get it fixed up if it is possible, see
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; point #6.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yes, please :), then I could use it too, because I stopped to dig more
</I>&gt;<i> inside when I saw GPL there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; #4) This 'Novell license' is the MIT X11 license, the only mention of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Novell is in the copyright, because it is code written by Lluis as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Novell employee, so Novell owns the copyright. The code is still MIT
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; X11.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> :))))
</I>
Interesting. I didn't know.

&gt;<i> &gt; #5) SWF controls are not easy/helpful to port to gtk# in all honesty. In
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fact, they suck to port. Everything is pretty different, and you don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; want to use System.Drawing on Linux if you can use Cairo directly (imo),
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and even if you did, its still not a good path to rainbows and puppies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like to use NPlot, for example, it uses Windows.Drawing, do you know any
</I>&gt;<i> alternative to it in pure Cairo-based Gtk#?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; #6) I have no idea what license the data grid is under, but if it is not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MIT X11, it will have to be removed from MD with a quickness. If Daniel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can relicense it, great, if he cant/wont, then its toast, we *DO NOT*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; want to push any license but the MIT X11.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can you give a one short definition of why in your oppinion is MIT X11
</I>&gt;<i> better then i.e. LGPL?
</I>&gt;<i> If there will be some library/widget which is veeeery good and licensed
</I>&gt;<i> under LGPL and
</I>&gt;<i> you'd like to use it in MD will not you miss it?
</I>
The difference is freedom, in the real sense.

The free GPL/LGPL licenses allows for _real_freedom_. In other words,
as with all freedoms, there are limits. And it is those limits that
those licenses have. I am free to take my shotgun and shoting animals
on thee wilderness (as long as I am not killing protected specicies
noor in reproduction times), but my freedom stops short of allowing me
to go for a shooting spree on the downtown mall killing anything that
moves, instead.

The more libertine MIT X11 license allows for _real_libertinane_
behaviour. It allows for somebody to take code, lock it away in tight
locks, modify it at will, and then redistribute it with a license of
his own choosing, removing my . With it, I could go the downtown mall
for my shooting spree, but I could also go to the wilderness. This
license is even worst that the libertine New BSD license, because it
would allow somebody to write(?) a proprietary software and then claim
that it is endorsed by me.

&gt;<i> &gt; #7) Mike Kestner is my personal savior. He wrote, maintains, and rocks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; out (with his cock out) all over gtk#.
</I>
Well, I don't care how good Mike is, he is a poor excuse for a
personal savior. Try Jesus instead.

&gt;<i> &gt; #8) Whatever widget library you wonderful people cook up will most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; likely never be put into gtk# itself. This has been the stance in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; past w/ gtk#, and is a sane one. gtk# is a wrapper for gtk+, not a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wrapper + extension + other cool widgets. Another library would be a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; great place for other cool widgets. Now. That said, a single widget
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; library to rule them all is a bad idea. As a developer, I want
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; copy/pastable code. I want to include your source into my app. That
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; makes it easy to update, and easy to deploy. It makes me feel warm, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; well loved.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If library is &quot;properly&quot; developed - consider it as a repository of all
</I>&gt;<i> useful
</I>&gt;<i> widgets/controls not as a one big library with everything messed up. If
</I>&gt;<i> designing
</I>&gt;<i> and maintaining everything in a good way and keep to some rules - copy paste
</I>&gt;<i> will work just fine ;).
</I>&gt;<i> ... I would consider it as something like lovely widgets set/repository :)).
</I>&gt;<i> .. ok, maybe some additional layer of
</I>&gt;<i> independent utilities/helpers.
</I>
Agreed.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; #9) Please dont use the Gtk.Controls namespace. Use a new toplevel, like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the rest of gtk#.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I see that it makes no sence now. And in this case it makes even more
</I>&gt;<i> sense to have a
</I>&gt;<i> higher level widgets library since Gtk# is supposed to be as close to Gtk+
</I>&gt;<i> as possible? And
</I>&gt;<i> our subj. is something .NET-stylish, ... and it should be separate for sure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some guesses/votes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Gwl (Gtk# Widgets Library), ... NGwl ;)
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Some short name like nice used for other mono libraries.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. ??
</I>
4. Controls

&gt;<i> &gt; #10) As far as looking for widgets for this library, all of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MonoDevelop.Components is pretty slick awesomeness.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They are nice, but not all is complete as I see. Since there are a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> controls
</I>&gt;<i> which can be designed and implemented separately - I see a big need of such
</I>&gt;<i> library.
</I>&gt;<i> and it will bring more people to Gtk# for sure :).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ... maybe Eclipse / SWT is a nice example of similar approach since ther is
</I>&gt;<i> also separate library for UI
</I>&gt;<i> and another advantage is that it would be easier to maintain it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An ideal situation would be if people involved in MD development also will
</I>&gt;<i> take part in design and development of such
</I>&gt;<i> a library but at the same time to keep it generic to be used in any other
</I>&gt;<i> application at the same time.
</I>&gt;<i> (I looked only on TreeView in MD and as I know now it also uses some MD
</I>&gt;<i> Services, Commands .
</I>&gt;<i> also not completely easy for copy/paste :)).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anyway. This conversation looked like it was going nowhere relatively
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; quickly, and with near terminal velocity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> .. it just some thoughts/ideas to make life easier and not to google and
</I>&gt;<i> look for place where it is
</I>&gt;<i> possible to copy/paste each we need some more advanced and nice widget.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hopefully some of these points
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can clear some things up. And the other ones that are clearly my opinion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can just be taken as words of advice from someone who has been writing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gtk# applications for the last 2 years. (Holy crap, Pedro and I did
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; start hacking on MD 2 years ago).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks - very informative and usefull :).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> --Gena
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; --Todd

And to this, I tip my hat.

Jesus bless you all,
