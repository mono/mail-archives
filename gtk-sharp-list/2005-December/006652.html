<PRE>Hi guys,

I've started playing with GTK# and development at all a few weeks ago
and now I came across a few problems that I can't overcome myself. So
far I have used the Mono documentation and hours of fiddling around,
but I am slowly running out of patience and I decided to ask You for
help and advice. OK, here are my questions. I would really appreciate
your help.

Custom menu/toolbar/button icon images.
Should the image be in a specific format? I have 64x64 svg and png and
I get a button with an empty place holder. My code looks like:

SubButton.IconWidget = new Image (&quot;sub.png&quot;);

sub.png is of course added in Resources (MonoDevelop).

RadioToolButton and Group
I just can't get it working. I need it to get two buttons that fill
the box below with a different view of the data. I just can't find a
working example (apart from UImanager which I wouldn't like to use at
that stage).

Two state toggle button
By two state I mean that is looks different (different icon) when it's
up or down. I want to use it as an &quot;expand&quot; button with an arrow
pointing one side when it's up and the other side when it's down.

Font Chooser SpinBox
Once again I can't find a working example of a SpinBox used as a Font Chooser.

Font Size SpinBox
How to get the SpinBox displaying the values in different intervals?
Some kind of predefined list?

Hide Paned widget
Is it possible to hide one &quot;side&quot; of a HPaned widget and show it when
a button is pressed? Is there other, preferred way of doing that? I
can imagine I could do it by packing my widgets in different
containers for different views but hiding seems most intuitive for me.
