Yes, I use it under windows version of my program and it is quite stable.
As I unndertood there is a possibiliti to use any Swf control in Gtk if it
is Graphics-based and
has presentation (control, form) separated from rendering, logic.



&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; #6) I have no idea what license the data grid is under, but if it is
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; MIT X11, it will have to be removed from MD with a quickness. If
</I>&gt;<i> Daniel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; can relicense it, great, if he cant/wont, then its toast, we *DO
</I>&gt;<i> NOT*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; want to push any license but the MIT X11.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Can you give a one short definition of why in your oppinion is MIT X11
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; better then i.e. LGPL?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If there will be some library/widget which is veeeery good and
</I>&gt;<i> licensed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; under LGPL and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; you'd like to use it in MD will not you miss it?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The difference is freedom, in the real sense.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The free GPL/LGPL licenses allows for _real_freedom_. In other words,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as with all freedoms, there are limits. And it is those limits that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; those licenses have. I am free to take my shotgun and shoting animals
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on thee wilderness (as long as I am not killing protected specicies
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; noor in reproduction times), but my freedom stops short of allowing me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to go for a shooting spree on the downtown mall killing anything that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; moves, instead.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The more libertine MIT X11 license allows for _real_libertinane_
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; behaviour. It allows for somebody to take code, lock it away in tight
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; locks, modify it at will, and then redistribute it with a license of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; his own choosing, removing my . With it, I could go the downtown mall
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for my shooting spree, but I could also go to the wilderness. This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; license is even worst that the libertine New BSD license, because it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would allow somebody to write(?) a proprietary software and then claim
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that it is endorsed by me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not really willing to get into this debate. However, you are wrong.
</I>&gt;<i> Considering that you were unable to even recognize the MIT X11 license,
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not quite sure why you feel expert enough to explain the
</I>&gt;<i> ramifications of choosing it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Gennadiy, as far as use in MD, we have made an exception for the Dock,
</I>&gt;<i> and are unlikely to make any other exceptions.
</I>

Yes, there maybe some parts, I dit not look in details but probably
Commands and menus / toolbars
management can be also extracted.

We feel that the MIT X11 allows for the greatest possible reuse of code.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, that does mean that someone could take your MIT X11 licensed code
</I>&gt;<i> and use it in their commercial application, but they can do that with
</I>&gt;<i> the GPL or LGPL, they just have to jump through hoops.
</I>

ok, thanks for the info.

Basically, I am an optimist. I believe that people contribute code back
&gt;<i> because they want to, not because they have to. The MIT X11 license fits
</I>&gt;<i> in with this. If a company modifies some code and doesn't want to give
</I>&gt;<i> it back, well, did you really lose out? They weren't going to give code
</I>&gt;<i> back regardless. And at least this way they will likely submit bugs.
</I>&gt;<i> Having worked for companies that utilize opensource code, we contribute
</I>&gt;<i> code back because we want to, not because we have to.
</I>

Agree.

Anyway, a licensing debate is not worth my time, or anyone on this lists
&gt;<i> time. I wanted to provide an alternate opinion, one that was a bit less
</I>&gt;<i> toe-the-RMS-line. If you are interested in other differences between
</I>&gt;<i> them, google is sure to find tons and tons of material.
</I>

Yes, lets stop licensing discussion, from what I've understood until now MIT
X11
is also fine for me :).
