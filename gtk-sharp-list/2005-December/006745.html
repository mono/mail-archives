</I>Hehe, don't worry.  I was an MFC programmer for over 6 years and it
wasn't until I fell in love with Mono that I pretty much stopped using
MFC/Visual Studio as my primary development environment.

As Daniel Morgan was mentioning, you can and should install the Gtk#
installer for .NET Framework. During the installation, it will detect to
see if you have Visual Studio .NET 2003 present and will create some
project templates for C# that help you create both Gtk# and Glade#
applications.

At this time, the Gtk# installers for .NET (2.4.0) already contain the
Gnome libraries that Gnome# uses for binding.  However, I have not done
any testing with this and I suspect that it may still need a lot more
integration work for correct operation with .NET and Gtk#/Gnome#.  There
are some additional factors that until now, strictly Gtk# applications
could do without.  I am referring to Gnome specifics like GConf, Mime
Types and Bonobo.

The Experimental Mono Combined Installer tries to include all of these
pieces and even recreate the appropriate execution environment for it
all.  On the other hand, the Gtk# Installers for .NET do little more
than setting up the GTK_BASEPATH environment variable and a few other
Win32 registry entries for the benefit of Visual Studio.

Work is still on going with the .NET specific installers and I invite
all interested to experiment and help me advance the state of the art
when it comes to some of the Gnome facilities while using the MS .NET
Framework Runtime and SDK.
