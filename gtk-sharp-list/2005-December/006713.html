NPlot works under Gtk#. Not really really well, but it does work.

Not really willing to get into this debate. However, you are wrong.
Considering that you were unable to even recognize the MIT X11 license,
I'm not quite sure why you feel expert enough to explain the
ramifications of choosing it.


Gennadiy, as far as use in MD, we have made an exception for the Dock,
and are unlikely to make any other exceptions.

We feel that the MIT X11 allows for the greatest possible reuse of code.

Yes, that does mean that someone could take your MIT X11 licensed code
and use it in their commercial application, but they can do that with
the GPL or LGPL, they just have to jump through hoops.

Basically, I am an optimist. I believe that people contribute code back
because they want to, not because they have to. The MIT X11 license fits
in with this. If a company modifies some code and doesn't want to give
it back, well, did you really lose out? They weren't going to give code
back regardless. And at least this way they will likely submit bugs.
Having worked for companies that utilize opensource code, we contribute
code back because we want to, not because we have to.

Anyway, a licensing debate is not worth my time, or anyone on this lists
time. I wanted to provide an alternate opinion, one that was a bit less
toe-the-RMS-line. If you are interested in other differences between
them, google is sure to find tons and tons of material.
