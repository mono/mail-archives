Well, there are differences:

1) those are C libraries, we are talking about C#/.Net which was
designed for encapsulation and reusability.

2) unlike gnome libraries, we have a captive audience: gtk# developers.
We don't have to gain acceptance by many disparate groups / companies
developing in different languages.  Plus, the gtk# community is still
relatively young.

</I>
Well, first I am not sure that the NPlot widget is a good fit for the
library I am talking about.  I just mean general purpose widgets that
extending the functionality of the gtk wrapper.  Such as a datagrid,
Docking for MDI interface, DockToolbar and so forth.  If there were only
a few of these then maybe rolling them into gtk# is best.

&gt;<i> And do you
</I>&gt;<i> really want the developers of DockToolbar to have to synchronize their
</I>&gt;<i> release schedule with the developers of WidgetA thru WidgetZ?
</I>
I think it could be managable.  If this widget library is synced with
the release schedule of gtk-sharp, all developers would know when bug
fixes / feature additions must be submitted.

I think the only way a library of widgets like this would work is if it
is officially a part of the mono project.  If that is not in the cards,
then I guess a repository is the way to go.
