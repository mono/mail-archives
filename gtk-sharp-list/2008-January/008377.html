<PRE>We are announcing the second public preview release of bindings for the
Gnome 2.20 APIs.  This release includes gnome-sharp-2.19.91 and
gnome-desktop-sharp-2.19.1 to fix configuration and API stability issues
identified in the initial release.  The gtk-sharp package remains at
version 2.11.91 released last week.

Tarballs are available from ftp.gnome.org, and packages for Fedora8 and
OpenSUSE 10.3 are available at:

<A HREF="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/mkestner/">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/mkestner/</A>

These releases are not API-stable yet, but are sufficiently mature to
begin testing against.  Anticipated API adjustments are expected to be
minimal at this point but might occur until we reach the stable 2.12.0
and 2.20.0 versions.

The gtk-sharp package contains bindings for glib, pango, atk, gdk, gtk,
and glade.  The API versions bound correspond to the versions shipped in
the GNOME 2.20 platform release set.

The gnome-sharp package binding set has changed with this release.
Remaining in gnome-sharp are art, gnomevfs, libgnome, libgnomeui,
libgnomeprint, libgnomeprintui, libpanelapplet, libgnomecanvas, and
gconf bindings.

The gnome-desktop-sharp package contains updated versions of the
gtkhtml, rsvg and vte bindings previously shipped in gnome-sharp, as
well as new bindings for libgnome-desktop, libnautilus-burn, and
libwnck.  We expect to add gtksourceview2 bindings as well prior to the
final release.  Bindings shipped in this package are not guaranteed to
be API stable since the underlying libraries are not guaranteed API
stable.  Attempts will be made to maintain compatibility where possible,
using policy assemblies.  When API compatibility is broken in underlying
libraries, the associated bindings will be parallel-installable with
prior versions.

Testing packages for openSUSE 10.3 and Fedora 8 can be found at:

<A HREF="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/mkestner/">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/mkestner/</A>

Source tarballs are available from ftp.gnome.org.

We expect to move rapidly toward the 2.12 and 2.20 final release, with
possibly one more preview depending on the number of issues identified.
Issues can be reported to bugzilla.novell.com module gtk#.
