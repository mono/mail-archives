<PRE>Hi there,

I just added the skeleton for .NET bindings to Tinymail.

Tinymail is a library intended for mobile E-mail clients.

The idea behind the library is to give infrastructure, tools and types
to build an E-mail client that'll run on a mobile device. It's core
goals are low memory consumption, few round trips and low bandwidth
requirements.

An example is Nokia's Modest which is using  Tinymail to create an
E-mail client for the N800 and N810 devices. 

bla bla bla

Its types are very often GTypeInterface ones. I learned from Mike's blog
that newer Gapi versions have some support for this build in.

Eager to test this stuff, I tried it and indeed I'm seeing the various
Gapi tools find my interfaces and create .NET equivalents.

This is the SVN commit for the skeleton, by the way:
  <A HREF="http://tinymail.org/trac/tinymail/changeset/3302">http://tinymail.org/trac/tinymail/changeset/3302</A>
You enable it using --enable-dotnet-bindings

cd bindings/dotnet ; make

It wont compile yet, though. I got these errors:

<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/gtk-sharp-list">pvanhoof at schtrumpf</A>:~/repos/tinymail/trunk/bindings/dotnet$ 


I wonder what my options are. Can I override sufficient things to get
rid of these problems? Can I provide my own alternative code for the
properties and methods that are failing here?

And how? And if documented, where can I find this documentation?

Another question: can I change the type hierarchy of generated types? I
for example have a Tny.List and a Tny.Iterator that I sure would like to
adapt to make it implement the IList interface of .NET. I also have a
Tny.Stream that I think could use some System.IO.Stream magic here and
there.

I would prefer to have language bindings that are comparable to each
other in API. I'm adding J&#252;rg Billeter in CC. J&#252;rg coded on the Vala
bindings for Tinymail. Vala, the programming language, is being designed
after C#. Therefore I'm confident that the bindings can be made to look
the same.
