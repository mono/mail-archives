<PRE>Hi there,

If I look at the prefix of both gtk-sharp and tinymail's -sharp
installation, I noticed that gtk-sharp has .config files installed.

Tinymail's -sharp install directory doesn't have these .config files
installed. I'm not really immediately finding what in the build of
gtk-sharp is installing them (I kept the Makefile.include identical for
that part of the build Makefile code afaik).

I'm guessing these config files are necessary for the .dll-&gt;.so mapping?
Something like that is what they seem to contain as XML data. Obviously
I mimicked them as good as possible using gtk-sharp's code.

Also, what is this policy.$(API_VERSION).config file for by the way?

</I>&gt;<i> other things too)

</I>&gt;<i> They might not be 100% correct. I tried hard to get everything right
</I>&gt;<i> immediately but I'm guessing it's not right yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For example the libtinymail-platform-sharp for some reason only has
</I>&gt;<i> one .cs file in generated. That can't be right. Most of the types that
</I>&gt;<i> in the C API only have a constructor also didn't get a .cs file in the
</I>&gt;<i> generated directory. If I look at the generated API, a lot is missing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have no clue why the codegenerator of gapi is not generating code for
</I>&gt;<i> those types. They do seem to be in the -api.xml and .raw files and they
</I>&gt;<i> are not slashed in the .metadata files.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The libtinymail-camel-sharp things seem to crash gapi's code generator,
</I>&gt;<i> so this one is not in the SUBDIRS of bindings/dotnet/Makefile.am a.t.m.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm generating .pc files for the pkgconfig libdir, but they might not be
</I>&gt;<i> completely correct. I tried mimicking gtk-sharp's files but I might have
</I>&gt;<i> gotten something wrong. I don't know (haven't testing it yet).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The SNK file, the AssemblyInfo.cs file, are all things that I might have
</I>&gt;<i> gotten wrong too. I tried copying as much as possible from how gtk-sharp
</I>&gt;<i> does all this magic.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have not yet made .custom files for Tny.List and Tny.Stream. The
</I>&gt;<i> reason is that both are GTypeInterface types (interfaces in .NET) and
</I>&gt;<i> that adding code in the .custom file only alters the interface. It wont
</I>&gt;<i> alter the Adaptor that Gapi generates. So I can't really influence these
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces a lot (I can't make them require implementing IList, for
</I>&gt;<i> example).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For Tny.Stream I might have to rename the original Tny.Stream to
</I>&gt;<i> something else in the .NET binding and make the .NET version of
</I>&gt;<i> Tny.Stream inherit from System.IO.Stream. This, is going to be quite
</I>&gt;<i> tricky to get it right, I think.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can really use assistance from the gurus in this channel. Tinymail is
</I>&gt;<i> a relatively large library (in terms of API availability) with more
</I>&gt;<i> compilation options, possibilities, combinations and switches than Gtk+
</I>&gt;<i> has. That's because the project's focus is mobiles and each and every
</I>&gt;<i> mobile is typically different from each other mobile.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway .. so here's the skeleton of the binding. All the unpleasant
</I>&gt;<i> crappy autotools work is done.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The tweaking of it is something I'm sure a .NET enthusiast is going to
</I>&gt;<i> like working on.
