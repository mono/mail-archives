</I>I think part of the reason that no one has mentioned anything on the list
yet is because a lot of this is still being planned/figured out. So,
essentially nothing official. I think the hope though is to have the
binding tool improved significantly over the summer and maybe even a beta
release of gtk-sharp3. If that gets accomplished then the beginning of
porting apps over to gtk-sharp3 that are currently on gtk-sharp2 (and where
there is a maintainer willing to do the work).

As some of this is all still up in the air there is no guarantee that it
will all happen. If you work for or know companies that would be willing to
sponsor the hackfest later this year that would be a great help.

Thanks,
Stephen
