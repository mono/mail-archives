<PRE>I've taken a good look at GTK3 and to be honest I'm not sure what it
offers that GTK2 didn't.

They went to all the effort of rolling the major version number and
breaking compatibility but didn't solve the resolution independence
problem. What the hell where they thinking? Seriously, in a few years
you won't be able to get a 96 dpi monitor everything in GTK3 apps will
be to small to use.

There is an open bug about it since 2008. Which people have argued
back and forth about but have done nothing at all. In the post full HD
world of retina displays and quad HD, GTK3 will be rendered irrelevant
and obsolete. It has completely and utterly missed the boat.

Ubuntu has gone with QT for ubuntu touch because it does resolution
independence correctly.

Which makes me wonder should I be going to the effort of porting to
GTK3, or should I be moving to QT so that my user interface can
actually have a future?

What do you guys think? Is there something I&quot;m missing in GTK3 which I
can use to achieve resolution Independence?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've found some positive news on the Banshee maillist [1]. It seems they

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> I think part of the reason that no one has mentioned anything on the list
</I>&gt;<i> yet is because a lot of this is still being planned/figured out. So,
</I>&gt;<i> essentially nothing official. I think the hope though is to have the binding
</I>&gt;<i> tool improved significantly over the summer and maybe even a beta release of
</I>&gt;<i> gtk-sharp3. If that gets accomplished then the beginning of porting apps
</I>&gt;<i> over to gtk-sharp3 that are currently on gtk-sharp2 (and where there is a
</I>&gt;<i> maintainer willing to do the work).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As some of this is all still up in the air there is no guarantee that it
</I>&gt;<i> will all happen. If you work for or know companies that would be willing to
</I>&gt;<i> sponsor the hackfest later this year that would be a great help.
</I>&gt;<i>
