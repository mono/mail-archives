Thanks for responding.  That's weird.  Prior to my fiddling around with the
OnDeleteEvent handler, a.RetVal was being set to true (and of course, the
window was closing normally).  At this point I've tried setting it both to
true and to false and neither way seems to help -- the window still closes.

</I>perhaps?  I've noticed that if I set a.RetVal to false, run my program and
then close it, in monodevelop the &quot;Debug&quot; (run) toolbar button remains
disabled and I have to shut down monodevelop to make this toolbar button
re-enable.  Is this telling me something but I'm just too dense to get it? 
Also, if I'm supposed to set a.RetVal a particular way in order to cause the
window to stay open, I assume that I shouldn't be calling Application.Quit,
or should I?  Thanks!
