<PRE>Since I dropped from the face of the earth for 5 months, I feel I
probably owe apologies to some people for not fulfilling my promises. It
was just the fact that life took its turn and went where I never wanted
it to go (more on that in CHANGELOG).

Related to few messages I saw in archives of this mailing list.

In any case:

I set up gtk-databind repository on sourceforge (and that was just on
the day I dissapeared because of computer problems, which were followed
with complete data crash) so anyone interested in testing can simply do

svn co <A HREF="https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gtk-databind">https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gtk-databind</A> gtk-databind

I will be actively working again on databindings in one week and I would
be appreciating any feedback on them. First I still have to fix some
personal things related to my daily bread and butter part of work.

2. related to TreeView (if they work). Yes, they do, just do work for
all kinds of Combos (with multiple columns) and for IconView (look at
sample in svn, it has implemented all kinds of controls, including
treeview)

p.s. if anyone hacked on them I would appreciate if someone would let me
know where changes can be found
