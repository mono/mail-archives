I hate to answer my own questions but maybe some poor soul will find it 
useful. I managed to get the desired result if on expose I also call:

DrawingaArea.SetSizeRequest (int width, int height);

I wonder if that's the thing I should use. Is it that easy?
And if it is why didn't anyone answer my question? It seems to be a more 
general problem on that list. Just looking on last month's statistics - 
out of 37 questions 23 remained unanswered! OK, I did count duplicate 
ones and non-question posts but that doesn't change the image too much.
On the PyGTK list it looked like 51/20 with a lot announcements in those 
unanswered.
What's the problem? Is it that the GTK# people are mostly also GTK+ 
people and they rather write to GTK+ list?
Come on guys. We can do better than that. Let's not be the least 
responsive community out there.

Cheers
Piotr
