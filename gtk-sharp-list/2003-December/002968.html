Well I gave it a shot, and it almost works wonderfully.  I statically
create the Window as done for the About window in Monodoc.  And when the
Close button is clicked I call Hide().  When the window is called again
it opens perfectly without re-creating the window.  But when I call
Hide() on it through the window Destroy signal, and try to reopen it,
the window is malformed.  All I can see are the edges of the window, no
content -- approximately 4x20 pixels.  Any ideas why or how to fix this?

Also, how do I truly destroy a newly opened window from memory?
