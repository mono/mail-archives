Sorry, nightmare was an overstatement there (I now realize I was thinking=20
of compiling Mono more than gtk-sharp).  Actually before about 0.12 or so=20
I had no trouble installing gtk-sharp and the problems now are probably=20
related to my ignorance of how things work on Linux. =20
=46or the gtk-sharp compilation problems on Debian you suggested:=20
&quot;Your packager has two fixes to choose from: =A0install libasound.la in
asound-devel, or don't install the .la that is referencing it. =A0You'll
need a fixed package from your distributor, unless you want to go
through your libdir and manually delete the offending .la.&quot;
How would I determine which .la is referencing the missing liblinc.la?
I guess I could install liblinc from source but I fear it'll lead me down=20
another fruitless road of compile errors :(

Thanks,
Leo
