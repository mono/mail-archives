Mike said he wanted to target 2.5, not 2.7.
I don't mind having to stick with a more or less stable release for 2.2 
until 2.6 comes out.  As long as it doesn't take ages and ages for 
2.6.  :)  Gnome 2.6 is dependant on GTK 2.4 coming out, right?  From a 
quick glance at the GTK site that doesn't seem that close (no betas or 
rcs).
