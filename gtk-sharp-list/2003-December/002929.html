My example is actually being used by people to learn about Gtk-Sharp so
I fixed those OO issues ;-)

We have also build a (not finished in code) example of an application
that uses the auto* tools for it's build process. This build process
includes creating a script that will invoke &quot;mono theexe.exe&quot;. Later I
will also include the steps to convert po-files to resource files and
stuff like that.

Perhaps somebody should create a complete Gtk-Sharp example which uses
nAnt. Most unanswered questions we had during the development of such
samples where building-related. And when asking here, how deployment
should happen, they all answer: xcopy xcopy !!! well tell that to the
RedHat (Fedora) and Debian packagers. I will probably get a &quot;xcopy your
ass&quot;-like response. My personal opinion is that deployment and building
techniques is a major issue lacking in the current development
environment of Gtk-Sharp and Mono. Fixing this issue can be as easy as
creating a document which guides new developers through all this, or
create examples (but I don't know how correct we did it, I am not a
auto* freak, lol).

To Pablo (or others), if you are planning to study my examples, feel
free to report any such OO related issue in the code. I am using these
examples to teach friends at LUGS about Mono and development using Gtk-
Sharp. So they should be very very correct indeed.
