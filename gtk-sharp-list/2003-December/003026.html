&gt;<i> So, is this OK?

I had wanted to post some thoughts about this last week, and then got
called out of town unexpectedly on Wednesday for an uncle's funeral.

I won't be able to release anything targeting the 2.5 platform on the
22nd.  CVS is still targeting the 2.2 tarballs, and I want to push out
another release against 2.2 with all the recent advancements before
moving the target to 2.5.

This move will force all Gtk# CVS users to build the entire GNOME
platform from source. (Part of me thinks it's a bad idea to have Gtk#
CVS follow the C API this closely to the bleeding edge, but I know the
current situation is aggravated by the lack of a &quot;stable&quot; release of
Gtk#.)  In the short term this is going to be a huge PITA for Gtk#
application developers, and I don't plan to maintain parallel 2.2 and
2.5 branches.

So, I hope to freeze a final 2.2 platform release before the end of the
year. Hopefully this release will be usable enough to hold over the app
developers until they can switch to 2.6. 

Then I'll cut over to the 2.5 platform in CVS trunk and release another
version which will roughly correspond to the 12/22 release on the
platform bindings schedule.  Once I've done that, it should be possible
to release in sync with the schedule. 

So, if anybody has any issues with this plan, speak up soon. I'd like to
get some feedback on whether this approach is feasible.  If it is, I'll
try to move forward on it after Xmas.
