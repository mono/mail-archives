<PRE>&gt;<i> I won't be able to release anything targeting the 2.5 
</I>&gt;<i> platform on the 22nd.
</I>
How about 2 weeks after the 22nd? I am allowing 2 weeks lateness, but I hope
that nobody risks using that.

&gt;<i>  CVS is still targeting the 2.2 
</I>&gt;<i> tarballs, and I want to push out another release against 2.2 
</I>&gt;<i> with all the recent advancements before moving the target to 2.5.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This move will force all Gtk# CVS users to build the entire 
</I>&gt;<i> GNOME platform from source.
</I>
Yes, just as all Nautilus hackers need to build the entire platform from
source.

&gt;<i> (Part of me thinks it's a bad 
</I>&gt;<i> idea to have Gtk# CVS follow the C API this closely to the 
</I>&gt;<i> bleeding edge,
</I>
You can't be in-sync without being in-sync. Are you suggesting that you
don't want to develop Gtk# for GNOME 2.6 until GNOME 2.6 is stable, or even
until it is in binary form in many distros?

&gt;<i> but I know the current situation is aggravated 
</I>&gt;<i> by the lack of a &quot;stable&quot; release of
</I>&gt;<i> Gtk#.)  In the short term this is going to be a huge PITA for 
</I>&gt;<i> Gtk# application developers, and I don't plan to maintain 
</I>&gt;<i> parallel 2.2 and 2.5 branches.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, I hope to freeze a final 2.2 platform release before the 
</I>&gt;<i> end of the year. Hopefully this release will be usable enough 
</I>&gt;<i> to hold over the app developers until they can switch to 2.6. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then I'll cut over to the 2.5 platform in CVS trunk and 
</I>&gt;<i> release another version which will roughly correspond to the 
</I>&gt;<i> 12/22 release on the platform bindings schedule.  Once I've 
</I>&gt;<i> done that, it should be possible to release in sync with the 
</I>&gt;<i> schedule.
</I>
Please consider the 2 weeks thing, and tell me exactly when you expect to be
on the schedule. We can't keep you on the &quot;Beta&quot; list indefinitely unless we
know that you will try to follow the schedule.

If you don't have time to do releases, then I encourage you to delegate to
somebody who has time. I hope we work this out.

&gt;<i> So, if anybody has any issues with this plan, speak up soon. 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to get some feedback on whether this approach is 
</I>&gt;<i> feasible.  If it is, I'll try to move forward on it after Xmas.
