<PRE>Hi,

Still wondering for not raising any reaction with my previous posting
I'm proud the present the second edition of my Gtk# Installer for
Windows.

Gtk# assemblies are now strongly named, compiled with ngen and copied to
the assembly cache during installation. This solves the first part of
the long known &quot;.NET-Framework-cannot-find-Gtk#&quot; problem. Second part of
the well known problem is gtksharpglue.dll not being found. Best
solution for this so far: Manually tweaking the PATH environment
variable. The Gtk# Runtime and Development Environment introduces a more
elegant solution:

	public static void Main()
	{
		GtkSharpRuntimeEnvironment.Init();
		Gtk.Application.Init();
		...

Well. What does this magic GtkSharpRuntimeEnvironment.Init? It checks
the current platform. If Windows is identified the registry is scaned in
order to find the Gtk+ and the Gtk# Runtime Environment. When they are
found the application's PATH is adjusted. When not an exception verbosly
explaining the problem is thrown. Feel free to show it your user. Of
course you'll have to link against the GtkSharpRuntimeEnvironment
assembly if you wish to use this magic function.

So with this package deployment of Gtk# based applications on Windows
should have become quite trivial: You just ask your users to install the
.NET Framework, the Gtk+ Runtime Environment
(<A HREF="http://www.dropline.net/gtk/">http://www.dropline.net/gtk/</A>) and my Gtk# Runtime Environment
(<A HREF="http://taschenorakel.de/mathias/archive.en.html#gtk-sharp">http://taschenorakel.de/mathias/archive.en.html#gtk-sharp</A> *)). Once
those packages have found their way on the user's computer, Gtk# based
applications can be copied arround and renamed as randomly as the user
wishes.

Ciao,
Mathias (aka tbf)

*) Hopefully it is possible to move the package to
<A HREF="http://gtk-sharp.sourceforge.net/">http://gtk-sharp.sourceforge.net/</A> soon?
