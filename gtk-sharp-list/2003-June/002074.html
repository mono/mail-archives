I didn't say it changes wine files.

Ok. Red Hat uses sysv files currently to make sure wine is started when a 
Windows binary is run. How would you add your wrapper to binfmt_misc ? As 
a sysv-script ? Would your script undo what the wine-package does ? Make 
sure it does work after an upgrade of a wine package ? If you have 
multiple entries, it's undetermined what exactly happens afaik (I've seen 
strange things here, while testing)


&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;It works&quot; doesn't necessarily make it the best solution. A shell wrapper 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; works too.

</I>
That's not why I said that. The user doesn't know it's starting a 
shell-wrapper either, so it's transparant to the user and works on _all_ 
systems, not only those that have shipped the binary wrapper.

BTW I made that comment because &quot;a shell wrapper works too&quot; but is 
clearly not a prefered solution either. It would be a temporary solution 
that works everywhere.


&gt;<i> I think it's the best option :-P
</I>
I think a binfmt_exe kernel module would be the best option. Transparant, 
can't be undone by binfmt_misc, and works just the same way as other files 
are made to work that can't take advantage of binfmt_misc.

Of course, it hasn't been written yet.
