<PRE>Hi,

I've also been thinking about this problem

&gt;<i>Gtk# assemblies are now strongly named, compiled with ngen and copied to
</I>&gt;<i>the assembly cache during installation. This solves the first part of
</I>&gt;<i>the long known &quot;.NET-Framework-cannot-find-Gtk#&quot; problem. Second part of
</I>&gt;<i>the well known problem is gtksharpglue.dll not being found. Best
</I>&gt;<i>solution for this so far: Manually tweaking the PATH environment
</I>&gt;<i>variable. The Gtk# Runtime and Development Environment introduces a more
</I>&gt;<i>elegant solution:
</I>
How did you solve that ? Because I tested a few things and I came to the
following conclusion
Lets say assembly X is an open-source assembly, your installer installs
assembly X into the GAC

Then I recompile assembly X from cvs (which is then unsigned) and compile my
application Y against assembly X
In my experience my application Y will never run against the version of
assembly X which is located in the GAC
because my application doesn't expect a signed assembly X (strong named)

As long as people compile against the strong named assemblies in the GAC
(from your installer) their application will work
fine, but if they compile against GTK# on mono it may not always work as
expected.

Unless I'm missing something, which I think is the case,
could you give me some more information.

Btw, I'm sure many people (including me) are very happy with your installer
:<i>)

Tim.

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Still wondering for not raising any reaction with my previous posting
</I>&gt;<i> I'm proud the present the second edition of my Gtk# Installer for
</I>&gt;<i> Windows.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Gtk# assemblies are now strongly named, compiled with ngen and copied to
</I>&gt;<i> the assembly cache during installation. This solves the first part of
</I>&gt;<i> the long known &quot;.NET-Framework-cannot-find-Gtk#&quot; problem. Second part of
</I>&gt;<i> the well known problem is gtksharpglue.dll not being found. Best
</I>&gt;<i> solution for this so far: Manually tweaking the PATH environment
</I>&gt;<i> variable. The Gtk# Runtime and Development Environment introduces a more
</I>&gt;<i> elegant solution:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> public static void Main()
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i> GtkSharpRuntimeEnvironment.Init();
</I>&gt;<i> Gtk.Application.Init();
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well. What does this magic GtkSharpRuntimeEnvironment.Init? It checks
</I>&gt;<i> the current platform. If Windows is identified the registry is scaned in
</I>&gt;<i> order to find the Gtk+ and the Gtk# Runtime Environment. When they are
</I>&gt;<i> found the application's PATH is adjusted. When not an exception verbosly
</I>&gt;<i> explaining the problem is thrown. Feel free to show it your user. Of
</I>&gt;<i> course you'll have to link against the GtkSharpRuntimeEnvironment
</I>&gt;<i> assembly if you wish to use this magic function.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So with this package deployment of Gtk# based applications on Windows
</I>&gt;<i> should have become quite trivial: You just ask your users to install the
</I>&gt;<i> .NET Framework, the Gtk+ Runtime Environment
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.dropline.net/gtk/">http://www.dropline.net/gtk/</A>) and my Gtk# Runtime Environment
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://taschenorakel.de/mathias/archive.en.html#gtk-sharp">http://taschenorakel.de/mathias/archive.en.html#gtk-sharp</A> *)). Once
</I>&gt;<i> those packages have found their way on the user's computer, Gtk# based
</I>&gt;<i> applications can be copied arround and renamed as randomly as the user
</I>&gt;<i> wishes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ciao,
</I>&gt;<i> Mathias (aka tbf)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *) Hopefully it is possible to move the package to
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://gtk-sharp.sourceforge.net/">http://gtk-sharp.sourceforge.net/</A> soon?
</I>&gt;<i>
