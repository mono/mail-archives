Signing an assembly alters the assemblies name. Remember in .NET an 
assembly name doesn't only include the name of the file used to store 
the assembly. In .NET an assembly name also includes &quot;minor&quot; details 
like version number, locale (aka. &quot;culture&quot;) and a &quot;PublicKeyToken&quot;.

So if the names of two assemblies differ, then why should the runtime 
even try to bind a program linked with the assembly &quot;Frosch, 
Version=0.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null&quot; against another 
assembly called &quot;Frosch, Version=0.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, 
PublicKeyToken=2a1844afb4c7924f&quot;?

A solution for the problem _could_ be shipping the keychain used to sign 
the &quot;official&quot; assemblies with the distribution. You could then sign 
your CVS versions of the assemblies with that key. If I understood the 
concept behind strong assembly names correctly your manually built 
assemblies should get the same name as the distributed assemblies then.

Problem with that procedure: We cannot prove anymore that binaries we've 
shipped have not been modified by Fluffy Bunnies and other creatures.


Ciao,
Mathias
