<PRE>Hi,

I'm new to Mono/Gtk# so bear with me ;)

I'm having a problem with a Mono/Gtk# applet requiring *.so libraries 
instead of eg. *.so.0.0.1 libraries.

As you may know, *.so files are always packaged as part of the 
development-package, as it is considered bad practice to have applications 
link to *.so packages directly. What either mono or gtk-sharp is doing 
wrong.

Because of this, my 6k applet needs about 100MB of development-packages 
just to have its dependencies straightened out. And that's not really an 
option for end-users.

I'm wondering if there's any work going on to solve this, or if this is 
done on purpose for some reason. If not, could anyone tell me where to 
look to solve this ?

PS This is 1 of 3 problems I currently have with shipping my applications 
to endusers. My 2 other problems are the binfmt issue and what should I do 
if I need stuff from libegg. I'm not even sure why I need libegg for a 
simple tray applet.

Thanks in advance.
