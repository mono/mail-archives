Gtk# 0.9 was tagged/released about a week before mono 0.24.  Apparently
an mcs change/fix went in before the mono release which broke the gtk#
build in rsvg.  The fix for this is on cvs, and will be available in
0.10.

In the meantime, if anyone wants to extract that patch from cvs, I'd be
happy to post it on the Gtk# download page for people to apply until
0.10 is out.  And before somebody asks, I have no estimate as to when a
0.10 release will be forthcoming.  :)

Thanks,
Mike
