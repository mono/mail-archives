&gt;<i> Hi there,

Okay.. that was me yesterday getting angry because stuff was not doing
what it suppose to do. So perhaps I was a little bit to harsh about the
subject. I am sorry for that ;).

I've forgot the Application.Init() which fixed most of the Gtk.Clipboard
issues. Once that worked I've managed to fix the casting issues too .. 

So yes; I got it working and yes the Gtk.Clipboard bindings do seem to
work (aldo, I still find them pretty difficult for what I needed them
for).

The cast turned out to be pretty easy .. 

In case you are interested in how I got it working .. here is the link
to the ViewCVS of the file :

<A HREF="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/gcm/Gcm.Net/Daemon/ClipboardManager.cs">http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/gcm/Gcm.Net/Daemon/ClipboardManager.cs</A>


I still don't know how I can get the correct size of a Atom
programmatically, so I just took 4 bytes for that. It also seems that
SelectionData.length is the length of SelectionData.Data in bytes (for
example if WaitForData(&quot;TARGETS&quot;) gives me 7 TARGET atoms then
SelectionData.length seems to be 28 in stead of 7 because 7 * 4 = 28. I
remember that the C Gtk+ API will give me 7 in stead of 28 (but, I can
be wrong: first check in case you are going to fix this)

So what I do ...

int sizeof_atom=4;

SelectionData targets = clipboard.WaitForContents
	(Atom.Intern (&quot;TARGETS&quot;, false));

for(int counter = 0; counter &lt; (targets.length); counter+=sizeof_atom)
{
	Atom a = new Atom ((IntPtr)targets.Data[counter]);

	Console.Write(&quot;Atom=&quot; + a.Name());

	Gtk.SelectionData data = 
		this.clipboard.WaitForContents (a);
}



&gt;<i> The issues that I have are ..
</I>
&gt;<i> * targets = clipboard.WaitForContents (Atom.Intern (&quot;TARGETS&quot;, false))

</I>
That was because I forgot Application.Init()

</I>
&gt;<i> * I cannot know the size of a Gdk.Atom and I assume that the

</I>
It's the amount of Bytes

&gt;<i> if a SelectionData.length is -1 and you want the property

</I>

This is still a problem ! With many targets-atoms (for example the
MULTIPLE target) SelectionData.Data will throw this Exception in stead
of returning null ! It's a &quot;public&quot; property so IMHO it should never
throw an Exception unless something &quot;major&quot; has not been initialized
yet. We don't want the programmer to know that &quot;if&quot; the
SelectionData.type is &quot;MULTIPLE&quot; that she should NOT try the
SelectionData.Data or else it will throw an Exception .. thats crazy!
A.t.m. it's even more obvious in C (there, you just always check for
NULL first)!


&gt;<i> Ick.. I am really really not sure how much of all this will actually
</I>&gt;<i> work :)
</I>

Well, it works.. hehe


&gt;<i> Please do not start thinking that I now hate Gtk-Sharp .. it's just that
</I>&gt;<i> the GtkClipboard, GtkSelection and GtkAtom wrappings really REALLY
</I>&gt;<i> dissapoint me a lot...
</I>
They still dissapoint me .. because it's not easy to get things working
thus Gtk-Sharp is missing it's point here: It SHOULD be easy else we are
doing the wrong thing with this library-binding.


&gt;<i> So until this GtkClipboard wrapping works .. I don't belive that any
</I>&gt;<i> major desktop application will get working if it uses gtk-sharp.
</I>
Okay well.. let's say that the average Gtk+ programmer will get things
working .. but not yet the average System.Windows.Forms developer who
want's to develop something using Gtk-Sharp.

&gt;<i> Of course I am interested in helping with fixing the gtk-sharp
</I>&gt;<i> wrappings.. So is, at this moment, somebody maintaining gtk-sharp?
</I>

idd



Again, sorry if I was to harsh ... I still love Gtk-Sharp and Mono! :-)






.. a lot (but I love my girlfriend more!!, imagine her reading that I
love a freakin programming environment more .. auwch!)
