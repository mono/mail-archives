I'd suggest filing a bug report (preferably with patch) to any c library
that is using // style comments.  Some compilers let you do it, but it's
a portability no-no.

&gt;<i> Can I commit?

Did you do a make in sources/ to see if anything changed in api/*.xml?
The patch isn't showing any such changes, but I'd like to confirm this
step was done, since you are making the change for an external lib and
may not have thought to rerun the parser on Gtk#.

If you haven't, and are willing to do the legwork, you could rework the
patch to include the changes to api/ after making sources/ and resend it
to me off list for review.  If not, I'll be happy to do it, but I'm not
sure when I will get to it, and the patch can't really be committed
until this has been done.

Thanks,
