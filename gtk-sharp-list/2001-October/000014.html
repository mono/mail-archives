Been meaning to do a status report, so here goes.

Initially, the effort was focused on proving feasibility, and developing
some knowledge about PInvoke.  Thanks to Bob Smith, the signal
propagation strategy is in pretty good shape now, and I've got property
marshalling pretty much in hand.  Method invocation is a simple exercise
in PInvoke.

So, in other words, I know what the wrappers need to look like at this
point.  My recent effort has been toward automated code generation for
the wrappers.  I've been experimenting with James Henstridge's defs
format and have enums and flags generating already. Sample property and
event defs just became available last week, so the defs format is
looking promising now.

The binding doesn't wrap much at this point, but the coverage should be
increasing dramatically in the next few weeks now that the focus has
switched to code generation. It'd be great to have SharpDevelop use
Gtk#, but there's simply not much there to use yet. I'd suggest
subscribing to gtk-sharp-list where I'll try to post regular status
reports.
