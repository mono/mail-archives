Would it then run under Linux with Mono? I also muct admit I do not know the
difference between the two options. I got in here in pure desperation after
searching for a place where I could find someone that could say something
qualified about the possibilities of getting this app to run on Linux and
OSX via Mono as this seemed to be the fastest and easiest way to go.

I appreciate any effort anyone is able to make. Why should Windows have all
the good apps? :-)
