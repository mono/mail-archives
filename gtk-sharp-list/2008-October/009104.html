</I>Actually, both cmake and autotools have bad support for mingw-w64 on 
Win64. MSys and cygwin are problematic to install/configure on win64 - 
they don't work without additional procedures done. Even win64 developer 
of Gtk+ (what's his name?) is using custom build scripts for win64 port 
of Gtk+, because autotools just don't work correctly on win64. For 
cmake, you must rename e.g. x86_64-pc-mingw32-gcc to gcc in order to be 
found by it. After many years win64 is here, only a few developers 
aren't lazy to create or support win64 ports. There is no difficulty 
with it. Simple recompiling application suffice to have win64 port (of 
course _correct_ use of WinAPI is required to accomplish it, programs 
where pointers are typecasted to long or event int are not worth using 
and mr programmer should really consider learning again how to 
programme. Windows is not the only platform where long is 32bit on 
win64. There are standards and 32bit long on 64bit os is part of them. 
It is Microsoft's free choice to choose it, same as on it is chosen to 
be 64bit on 64bit linux.)
