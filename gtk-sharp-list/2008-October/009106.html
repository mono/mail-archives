Some more info - my code is this;
Public Class MainWindow
		
		Public Shared Sub Main()
			Dim MainWindow As New Gtk.Window(&quot;Vine Animator&quot;)
		
			Application.Init()
			MainWindow.SetSizeRequest(1000, 800)
			MainWindow.ShowAll()
			Application.Run()
		End Sub
		
End Class

Please help, 
Thanks.
