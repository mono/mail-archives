<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt; I have a small amount of time coming up in the next couple of weeks, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; any port would be a Winforms port to just get it running under Mono. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; certainly wouldn't be looking to move it to gtk-sharp.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would it then run under Linux with Mono? 
</I>
It should do :-)

&gt;<i> I also muct admit I do not know the
</I>&gt;<i> difference between the two options. I got in here in pure desperation after
</I>&gt;<i> searching for a place where I could find someone that could say something
</I>&gt;<i> qualified about the possibilities of getting this app to run on Linux and
</I>&gt;<i> OSX via Mono as this seemed to be the fastest and easiest way to go.
</I>
It would have been better placed on the mono-lists rather than on the
gtk-sharp list to be honest...

TTFN

Paul
