To play devils advocate/dogfood advocate, how about MSBuild? :-)

The primary reason would be for easier MonoDevelop integration (i.e.
dogfooding), though this has the following downsides:

1. It would require MonoDevelop to build, and MonoDevelop depends on
Gtk# for building, i.e. a bad circular dependency.  xbuild should help
with this.

2. We'd have to &quot;extend&quot; MSBuild to support autoconf-style target
checking.  I have no idea how difficult this would be or what would
otherwise be entailed.

Consequently, if we were to consider such a migration it wouldn't be
soon (we'd have to solve the above concerns), but I think it's an
interesting possibility...
