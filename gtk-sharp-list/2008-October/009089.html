<PRE>
I'm writing an application in VB, using SharpDevelop's .NET 2.0 Compiler
(SharpDevelop 2 doesn't work with the mono compiler for some reason), and
when i try to compile, i get the exception...

Exception System.AccessViolationException was thrown in debuggee:
Attempted to read or write protected memory. This is often an indication
that other memory is corrupt.

Any help would really be appreciated, 
Thanks.
