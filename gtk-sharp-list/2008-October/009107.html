</I>That not true. Yes we want have installer, but first all we need compile 
the tools. After compile things  we need use NSIS:
<A HREF="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Users">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Users</A>

Compiling GTK in windows need some magick before create the installer.

NSIS is a full scripting languages to create installer in windows. In 
the trunk of all free software you see that scripts.

&gt;<i>   I'm meeting with Brad and Cody
</I>&gt;<i> this weekend at the GNOME summit to try to upstream the win32 installer
</I>&gt;<i> process so we are more responsive with those.  The mac installers are
</I>&gt;<i> already handled responsively by the project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I still think auto* is the correct choice.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>There are obsolete technologies in linux and people don&#180;t mind that. I 
believe we have go ahead...

With waf you can compile in a easy way software for visual c++, mingw, 
gcc, mono, D, java, Qt, GTK, gnome, KDE,...

Like WAF in python we can hack it really easy. We can add support to 
IDEs workspace like code-blocks, netbeans, monodevelop, visual studio, etc

by default WAF works like auto*. CMAKE create workspaces for default in 
windows.

Regards.
