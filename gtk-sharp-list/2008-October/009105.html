Here goes my 2cents:

As well as it's happening with all kinds of technologies (for example
managed VS. unmanaged applications), the layers of abstractions have to
continue growing, even in build systems.

So, the argument should not be &quot;cross-platform&quot; but:

- Not &quot;awkward&quot; build system, in the sense that it should work in the
same way regardless of the OS used (so it's better a scenario in which
you have to install the same dependency in all platforms instead of
different dependencies depending on the underlying OS).
- More maintainable. Each shell system has its own wierd syntaxes. I've
been maintaining in the past a sort-of auto-tools build system but with
Win32-shell syntax, and, as well as it woudn't have been interesting to
make a Linux-layer that abstracts this syntax in order to make it build
outside Win32, it's not interesting to always use the inverse solution:
Cygwin/MinGW/whatever. We need to abstract all platform-dependant parts
into higher level of abstraction bits, as well as Mono has done in the
development scenario, in order to let developers from all platforms
share and reuse knowledge.
- Moving from AutoTools to other system also provides an additional
advantage if the target system is supported out-of-the-box in an IDE.
Suddendly we will start attracting all those VS developers or
drag-and-drop programming lovers ;) - or command-line haters (I consider
myself a mixture of both).

Yes, these 3 reasons may not contain too much technical arguments, but
all of them target to a common concept: easier to use and maintain. A
key concept to attract contributors.

So I would advocate the mentioned tools depending on the advantages they
provide:
- CMake: already used by KDE community. Would avoid reinventing the
wheel and using a common tool, which I think it's always good
(especially for this freedesktop.org common projects that start to
arise; yeah, I've not forgotten am on gtk# list...), because of
knowledge reuse.
- MSBuild: JPryor makes a good point for advocating this one. The
circular dependency is not only addressed by xbuild but also the
&quot;mdtool&quot; tool.
- Waf: seems to have a showstopper for being considered as the
ready-to-go Gnome solution, and a fork is not worth it IMO.


I understand also the points of the maintainer because for him it
doesn't suppose an advantage, as his native platform is Linux and he
would have to learn a new project. This is like the VCS-to-DVCS
discussion... It will take time until everybody migrate...
