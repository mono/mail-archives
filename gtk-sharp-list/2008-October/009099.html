I'm not really interested in the old auto* sucks debate.  It does and it
doesn't.  I have a love/hate relationship with it.  As far as cygwin
being obsolete, I don't really care whether people use cygwin or mingw
or whatever.  The point is that there are auto* toolchains available on
win32 and they work.

</I>
The build system is portable.  I don't understand why you contend it
isn't when the toolchain is available on linux, win32, and mac
platforms.  If by unsupported you mean it has to be downloaded and
installed, are you arguing that the .Net SDK is unsupported on win32?

</I>
Either of these would have to produce some tangible benefit to the
project over what the auto* build does now in order for me to consider
switching from the standard build environment on the primary development
platform of the project.  I haven't heard anything so far that leads me
to believe that's the case.
