I asked them before posting here and they do not have any plans on porting
it at the moment. So I am hoping to find someone with the right skills and
the motivation to do it.

A port like this should benefit both the Linux and the MacOSX users. I am
keeping my fingers crossed. Is there a place to post this kind of
suggestions?

I don't know if they would consider switching to Mono for future releases if
they got some help with the port. Maybe that is not how things work in this
area. Forgive me if I seem without a clue - I am! :-)

Regards,

Svein
