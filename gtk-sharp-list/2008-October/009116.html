<PRE>
I have been searching for the best RSS reader for my use for a long time, and
kinda settled down on FeedDemon. But it is a Windows application and there
is no hope of seeing a native Linux version of this right now.

In comes RSS Bandit that looks like it has all the features I am looking
for, but it is also a Windows app! The difference here is that

1. It is opensource

2. It runs on .net

As I am not a programmer, I am hoping someone will have the interest in
moving this app over to Mono so it is possible to run it on Linux as well. I
can assist in running a website for the project, but the actual programming
has to be done by someone else.

Interested in taking a look at it? Check out <A HREF="http://www.rssbandit.org/">http://www.rssbandit.org/</A>

P.S. I am in no way connected to the RSS Bandit project. I am just a user
that would love to see a great application like this made available outside
the Windows user area.

Regards,

Datahverdag
