Have you ever used glade? All sarcasm aside, and with no offense meant
to the various authors, its horrible.

The libglade stuff is the only thing that makes it even usable. The UI
Builder itself has a horrible ui that borders on unusable at times.

It also has huge issues (read: doesnt support) widgets that aren't
compiled in.

There have been various efforts to fix it, but none have succeeded yet.
Hopefully a clean rewrite might solve some of those issues.

&gt;<i> for me it seems that glade is the recommended way to develop with gtk
</I>&gt;<i> (at least in python ;)
</I>
That is the recommended way to develop with gtk# as well, for now.
However it is not the 'end-goal' so putting any developer time into the
integration between glade and MD is wasted hours that can be better
spent implementing useful features, and bugfixing.
