<PRE>I've been gone from the gtk# world for awhile. I recently installed the
latest NovelForge Gtk# Win32 installer.

I recompiled an app from a previous version...some things I noticed:

1. The combo entry (internal-child) widget in C# is null after the
autoconnect. I had to use the Entry property of the combo to get at the
entry. I know this used to work.

2. The combo list values from glade are not showing up in the app. This also
used to work.

3. When running standalone (not in the IDE) the app runs with a console
window. This is a direct result of Glade.XML. Not sure I remember if this
has always been the case.

I looked high and low for answers to these questions, are these issues
known? This is being run on .NET 1.1 using VS.NET as the IDE.

Does the combo stuff still work under Linux?

Cheers,
Jae
