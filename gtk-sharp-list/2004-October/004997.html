<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> 1 - A simple Glade# app, built on Glade without any signals, besides
</I>&gt;<i> delete_event, attached on a bunch of code who shows a Gtk.Window.
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I've compiled it on Linux and tried to run it in Windows! After
</I>&gt;<i> installing the combined package of Mono+Gtk-sharp i've runned it and
</I>&gt;<i> everything went well, except the GtkToolItem and GtkToolButton widgets
</I>&gt;<i> that weren't recognized. I'm using glade-2.6.2.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My 1st question is: Are these widgets supported on Windows?
</I>
The issue here is that Gtk# is binding the older (and most commonly
available Gtk+).  And recent Glade versions gratuitously &quot;upgrade&quot; your
Gtk 2.2 project to 2.4 and there is no way that am aware of turning this
off.

Am not sure if there is a fix for this, other than &quot;lets move to
2.4&quot; (which we are going to do).

&gt;<i> All the code is running fine, since I have my own debug on each Thread
</I>&gt;<i> and it's debuggin right. So I close my app, and try to run it again!
</I>&gt;<i> SURPRISE! It works very well! The ProgressBar is updated and all the
</I>&gt;<i> widgets works ... 
</I>
That is one way of doing threads.   The recommended way is to use
Thread.Notify.

Basically threads and GUIs do not mix, and you should only ever do Gtk#
calls from one thread.  The Enter/Leave stuff sadly will take the lock
for too long, so your best answer really is Thread.Notify.

&gt;<i> On Windows, I've compiled* it tried to run it and it works, but my
</I>&gt;<i> Threads don't debug :(. It creates the wndSplash and then wndMain, but
</I>&gt;<i> all of them without widgets and the program does not respond.
</I>
You likely have a deadlock and you are not letting Gtk process events.

Solution: dont use Gdk.Enter/Leave thread stuff.  Use ThreadNotify
instead.

&gt;<i> My 3rd question: Any clue about this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *compiled: mcs -pkg:gtk-sharp wndSplash.cs wndMain.cs
</I>
Dont know what that is.

Miguel
