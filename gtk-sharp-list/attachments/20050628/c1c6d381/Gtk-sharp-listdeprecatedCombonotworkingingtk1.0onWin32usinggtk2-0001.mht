Both gtk# 1.0 and gtk# 1.9 are shipped with the mono 1.1.7 and 1.1.8 
windows installers.  Using -pkg:gtk-sharp will use gtk# 1.0 while 
-pkg:gtk-sharp-2.0 will use gtk# 1.9.  Both are installed in Mono's 
GAC.  So, both are running okay.  I did port sql# for gtk# to gtk# 2.0 
using a ComboBox, and it works okay.   However, my problem is with Combo 
working on gtk# 1.0.

Sorry, I could not get bugzilla to work for me today.  So, here is the 
error.

Take the Combo example in monodoc and run it. 

E:\backup_stuff\sqlsharpgtk&gt;mcs ComboTest.cs -pkg:gtk-sharp

E:\backup_stuff\sqlsharpgtk&gt;mono ComboTest.exe

(&lt;unknown&gt;:168): GLib-CRITICAL **: g_convert: assertion `str != NULL' failed

Unhandled Exception: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not 
set to
an instance of an object
in &lt;0x00152&gt; ComboSample:.ctor ()
in &lt;0x00016&gt; ComboSample:Main ()

This is the source:

using System;
using Gtk;

class ComboSample {
    Combo combo;
    
    static void Main () {
        new ComboSample ();    
    }
    
    ComboSample () {
        Application.Init ();
    
        Window win = new Window (&quot;ComboSample&quot;);
        win.DeleteEvent += new DeleteEventHandler (OnWinDelete);

        string[] list = new string[] {&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;three&quot;};
         
        combo = new Combo ();
        combo.PopdownStrings = list;
        combo.DisableActivate ();
        combo.Entry.Activated += new EventHandler (OnEntryActivated);
         
        win.Add (combo);
    
        win.ShowAll ();
        Application.Run ();
    }
    
    void OnEntryActivated (object o, EventArgs args) {
        Console.WriteLine (combo.Entry.Text);
    }
    
    void OnWinDelete (object obj, DeleteEventArgs args) {
        Application.Quit ();
    }
}

&gt;&gt;When I tried to run sql# for gtk# on Mono 1.1.7 for Windows, it failed 
&gt;&gt;to run because the Combo failed.
&gt;&gt;sql# for gtk# was using gtk# 1.0.x and gtk+ 2.6. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Even though Combo was deprecated in gtk+ 2.4, it should still work in 
&gt;&gt;gtk+ 2.6.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I recently chatted with Todd Berman, and he said the deprecated Combo 
&gt;&gt;works fine in MonoDevelop running on gtk+ 2.6.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;So, is this a Win32 problem with gtk+, gtk# 1.0.x , or the installer?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Can someone please look into this problem?
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;That's going to be hard to do without more details than &quot;the Combo
&gt;failed.&quot;  If you can provide a minimal sample application that
&gt;reproduces the problem, please open a bug report including the output
&gt;that occurs on failure.  
&gt;
&gt;When you say you &quot;tried to run sql# for gtk# on Mono 1.1.7 for Windows&quot;
&gt;are you saying you tried to run a binary that was compiled against Gtk#
&gt;1.0.x on mono 1.1.7?  There are different assembly versions involved
&gt;there, so if the 1.1.7 installer doesn't have a set of Gtk# 1.0.x
&gt;assemblies in its GAC, that would be a problem.  I'm just stabbing in
&gt;the dark because the problem description above is fairly vague.
&gt;
&gt;Gtk# 1.0.x and 2.x are parallel-installable and there is no current plan
&gt;to provide a mechanism to run applications compiled against 1.0.x on a
&gt;2.x installation.  You will still have to have 1.0.x assemblies
&gt;installed.  If this is the problem you are indicating, perhaps paco
&gt;needs to consider shipping a combined 1.0.x/2.x installer for Gtk# on
&gt;win32?  Either that or there needs to be a way to install 1.0.x and 2.x
&gt;Gtk# into a single mono install.
&gt;
&gt;FWIW, I just compiled and ran the sample/test/WidgetViewer.exe
&gt;application on the MS 1.1 runtime with gladewin 2.6.8-rc1 and Gtk# trunk
&gt;and the Combo sample (which is still Gtk.Combo, not ComboBox) runs
&gt;without any problems.
