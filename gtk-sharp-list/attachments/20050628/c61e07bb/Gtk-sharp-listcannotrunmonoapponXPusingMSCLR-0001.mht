GTK# included in the Combined Mono/GTK# Windows installer is meant for 
working with Mono.  This installer installs the GTK# assemblies in 
Mono's GAC.

You need to get Windows Installer for Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 for 
it to work properly on Microsoft .NET CLR.  This installer installs the 
GTK# assemblies into Microsoft .NET GAC.

&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;I've loaded the Mono-1.1.8 installer, and I also have .NET 1.1 loaded. I
&gt;can run a test app
&gt;
&gt;c:\&gt; mono test.exe test.glade
&gt;
&gt;with no problem.
&gt;
&gt;When I try
&gt;
&gt;c:&gt;\ test.exe test.glade
&gt;
&gt;I get a CLR error dialog which says &quot;Application has generated an
&gt;exception which cannot be handled&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;I've tried setting paths and other stuff, but nothing seems to works.
&gt;Can anyone give me some pointers ?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;Bryan
