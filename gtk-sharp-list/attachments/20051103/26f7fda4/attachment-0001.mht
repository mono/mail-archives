Hi Clark,

On 10/25/05, Clark Endrizzi &lt;cendrizzi@gmail.com&gt; wrote:
&gt; Hi all.  I'm a complete noob at this stuff (haven't done non-web programming
&gt; since I did C++ and MFC many years ago).  So I'm learning C# (which is
&gt; pretty straigh forward, very nice language) and GTK (which seems to be a lot
&gt; of stuff when you try to extend it beyond Glade).  Here is my issue.
&gt;
&gt;  I have a viewport that I'm including an HBox based class with text fields
&gt; in it (contact information).  Basically I am writing an Address Book program
&gt; that is similar to Apples in that you click on a person and it shows there
&gt; info in another pane.  To edit the contact you click on an edit button and
&gt; instead of opening a seperate window it changes the contact viewing pane
&gt; with the same info but in dialog boxes (and hence editable).  Once your done
&gt; you click apply and it switches the pane back to the view when you start
&gt; (static view).
&gt;
&gt;  To facilitate this I've created a viewport inside the viewing pane and I
&gt; have two classes based off HBox that I'm using; one for viewing (just using
&gt; labels) and one for editing (with the text boxes).  So I start my main
&gt; window with the glade stuff and add the default view (the class using
&gt; labels) inside the viewing pane, everythings great.  Then I click on the
&gt; edit button and I have it so that from the view port object it calls the
&gt; &quot;Remove&quot; function and then it try's to &quot;Add&quot; (the same way the default view
&gt; gets added) the editing HBox class.  It looks like it removes it fine, but
&gt; then it doesnt' add the other (or at least it's not showing).  Is this not
&gt; possible?  It's not giving me errors when I try and do this.
&gt;
&gt;  I will include the relevant code:
&gt;  This is in my main windows contructor.  It's creating both classes that I
&gt; want to use in the same pane.  I then set the static viewing class to my
&gt; view port.
&gt;          this.ContactVEdit = new ContactViewEdit();
&gt;           this.ContactVView = new ContactViewView();
&gt;
&gt; this.ContactView_GtkViewport.Add(this.ContactVView);
&gt;
&gt;  I call this when the edit button is clicked.  It's supposed to toggle
&gt; between the two views (so the user can edit and then view the contact from
&gt; the same pane).
&gt;      public void On_EditContact (object o, EventArgs args)
&gt;      {
&gt;          if(this.ContactViewOnEdit){
&gt;
&gt; this.ContactView_GtkViewport.Remove(this.ContactVEdit);
&gt;
&gt; this.ContactView_GtkViewport.Add(this.ContactVView);
&gt;              this.ContactViewOnEdit = false;
&gt;              this.Edit_GtkButton.Label = &quot;Edit&quot;;
&gt;          }else{
&gt;
&gt; this.ContactView_GtkViewport.Remove(this.ContactVView);
&gt;
&gt; this.ContactView_GtkViewport.Add(this.ContactVEdit);
&gt;              this.ContactViewOnEdit = true;
&gt;              this.Edit_GtkButton.Label = &quot;Apply&quot;;
&gt;          }
&gt;      }
&gt;
&gt;  Again, the view class is showing up but when the edit button is clicked
&gt; then the view class gets dropped but it's just grey, like the other class is
&gt; not being loaded.  I'm sure I just don't know GTK well enough.

I guess you should call this.ContactView_GtkViewport.ShowAll() to
redraw your new child widget.

As a side note, you don't need to explicitly use the &quot;this&quot; keyword in
C#.  You should only use it when you have an argument of your method
with the same name which masks the class member, so in this particular
case, &quot;ContactView_GtkViewport.ShowAll()&quot; is just enough ;-)

I like your UI approach by the way.  Avoiding pop-ups is always a good
idea I think.
