Check&nbsp;out&nbsp;Gtk.Assistant&nbsp;instead&nbsp;--&nbsp;it's&nbsp;the&nbsp;new,&nbsp;Gtk&nbsp;approved&nbsp;wizard<br>

Great&nbsp;suggestion...&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;pasted&nbsp;in&nbsp;this&nbsp;&lt;a&nbsp;href=&quot;http://www.mail-archive.com/mono-patches@lists.ximian.com/msg46474.html&quot;&nbsp;target=&quot;_top&quot;&nbsp;rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;code&nbsp;sample&nbsp;for&nbsp;the&nbsp;Gtk.Assistant&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;which&nbsp;worked&nbsp;great&nbsp;and&nbsp;looked&nbsp;awesome.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>

So&nbsp;I&nbsp;tried&nbsp;to&nbsp;write&nbsp;my&nbsp;own&nbsp;sample.&nbsp;&nbsp;However&nbsp;mine&nbsp;fails&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;comment&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Application&nbsp;Output&nbsp;window:&lt;BR&gt;<br>

It&nbsp;happens&nbsp;when&nbsp;I&nbsp;try&nbsp;to&nbsp;use&nbsp;an&nbsp;event&nbsp;handler&nbsp;to&nbsp;call&nbsp;the&nbsp;SetPageComplete()&nbsp;method.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;cant&nbsp;find&nbsp;anything&nbsp;like&nbsp;that&nbsp;on&nbsp;Google&nbsp;anywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;What&nbsp;exactly&nbsp;is&nbsp;that,&nbsp;and&nbsp;what&nbsp;am&nbsp;I&nbsp;missing?&lt;BR&gt;<br>
