<PRE>Sorry for not being clear. I'd love to take on the build stuff, learning as I go about what's in the codebase. How open would you be to replacing minor things that may be too verbose or time consuming to do with msbuild in something like ruby? I used to be a build engineer at MS, and there are few things I learned to enjoy less than maintain msbuild files.

</I>&gt;<i> Not sure what you mean by making the system compatible.  If you mean providing backwards compatibility in 3.0 to 2.x, I doubt that's going to be possible.  Too much changed and was removed.  Size negotiation, drawing, fundamental concepts which aren't going to map well.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you mean you want to start porting other libraries to work with 3.0, that may be premature, since we haven't even released a preview yet.  You could probably start the ports on branches or a github fork though to be merged back later, and report and help any issues the ports expose in gtk-sharp master. 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I was also interested in making general build improvements, like
</I>&gt;<i> possibly replacing Makefiles with xbuild project files. Any
</I>&gt;<i> thoughts/criticisms of this idea? Am I stepping on toes?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The glue is being reduced, but it's an obstacle to switching to xbuild projects.  We would also need MSBuild tasks to do things like fixup and generation.  Those are things I've wanted to do for a while, to make it easier to build on windows without cygwin/msys.  It's not a trivial task though.  If you wanted to take a stab, I'd be happy to try to answer questions as they arise.
