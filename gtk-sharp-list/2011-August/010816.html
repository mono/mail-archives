<PRE>Hi Gabe,

Not sure what you mean by making the system compatible.  If you mean
providing backwards compatibility in 3.0 to 2.x, I doubt that's going to be
possible.  Too much changed and was removed.  Size negotiation, drawing,
fundamental concepts which aren't going to map well.

If you mean you want to start porting other libraries to work with 3.0, that
may be premature, since we haven't even released a preview yet.  You could
probably start the ports on branches or a github fork though to be merged
back later, and report and help any issues the ports expose in gtk-sharp
master.


&gt;<i> I was also interested in making general build improvements, like

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The glue is being reduced, but it's an obstacle to switching to xbuild
projects.  We would also need MSBuild tasks to do things like fixup and
generation.  Those are things I've wanted to do for a while, to make it
easier to build on windows without cygwin/msys.  It's not a trivial task
though.  If you wanted to take a stab, I'd be happy to try to answer
questions as they arise.

Mike
