<PRE>Hello,

Thanks for bringing up this topic.

I did the previous 2.99.x, but only because nobody else was doing it, and
someone was foolish enough to give me commit access on the GitHub repo.
I've always considered myself as the &quot;de facto acting maintainer&quot; of the
master branch, but not much else.

In the last 5 months, I haven't been able to do any open source stuff in
general, so nothing for Gtk# in particular. My day job has been using up
all my brain juice, and getting a new apartment has not helped either.
I'm sorry for not addressing the pending PRs.

I hope I'll be able to get back to contributing, but I can't make any
promises. I'm of course open to suggestions on how to make things better,
and also for people who want to take over maintainership.
I don't way to block cool stuff from happening.


Regarding the strategy for newer GTK+ API and Gtk# releases:
My idea was, once git master reached a certain level of maturity, to create
a 3.0 branch, which would be API-stable and bug fixes only.
Git master could then be updated to bind the GTK+ 3.12 or 3.14 APIs, which
would then itself be branched off when it's mature.
So that's approach 2 described by Antonius.

I know that Gtk# 2.12 and before uses something like approach 1. See for
example:
<A HREF="https://github.com/mono/gtk-sharp/blob/gtk-sharp-2-12-branch/bootstrap-2.12">https://github.com/mono/gtk-sharp/blob/gtk-sharp-2-12-branch/bootstrap-2.12</A>

This was removed in the early days of porting to GTK+ 3, see:
<A HREF="https://github.com/mono/gtk-sharp/commit/fe2d4c311">https://github.com/mono/gtk-sharp/commit/fe2d4c311</A>

I don't know exactly what the pros and cons of that approach were, it was
before I was involved.
But I think nowadays with git it's much easier to maintain each API in it's
own branch, and merge what is needed from one to the other. Doing this with
SVN at the time would probably have been painful.

What do you think ? How far are we from being able to delare the Gtk# API
stable for 3.0 ?

Cheers,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Both approaches support simultaneous development of different Gtk#
