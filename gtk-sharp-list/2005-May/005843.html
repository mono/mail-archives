<PRE>Hey,

Not sure if this is the right place to post, but i have been searching 
for quite some time for the answer to this question. Anyways, here it is.

I have a HBox, and in that HBox i have two buttons. How do i go about 
setting the height and width of said buttons? I know it's something to 
do with the HBox, but i can't seem to figure it out. Here's some code 
that i have tried:

[Snip]
Button btnOK = new Button(&quot;OK&quot;);
Button btnCancel = new Button(&quot;Cancel&quot;);

HBox bHoz = new HBox();
bHoz.HeightRequest = 10;
bHoz.WidthRequest = 10;

bHoz.StartPack(btnOK);
bHoz.StartPack(btnCancel);
[/Snip]

Anyways, no matter what i try setting the HeightRequest and WidthRequest 
to nothing happens. Am i on the right track? Or completely wrong? I have 
tried reading the docs on the mono website, but they seem quite vague to 
me. If somebody could show me some code to change the size of said 
buttons, that would be great, but I'll settle for a link to some good 
GTK# tutorials. Thanks in advance.
