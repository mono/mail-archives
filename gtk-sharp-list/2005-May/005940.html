Why not just write a TreeModel implementation that allows all this. That
way your TreeModel object is used, and you dont have this option 1
option 2 stuff, both of which are sub-optimal.

Of course, the trick is properly implementing TreeModel (which is not
possible from pure managed code at this point)

As an aside, I know people think that DataBinding is super important,
but if you look at the features missing in gtk#, the big ones (seem to
be) 1) Can't implement GInterfaces 2) Can't override virtual methods w/o
lots of glue and hacks 3) the subclassing situation w/ CellRenderers is
semi-broken, most of this relates to #2.

Those 3 seem like truely important solvable issues, data binding doesn't
seem hard at all, especially if you can implement GInterfaces in C#.
