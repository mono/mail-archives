<PRE>&gt;<i> Those 3 seem like truely important solvable issues,
</I>&gt;<i> data binding doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> seem hard at all, especially if you can implement
</I>&gt;<i> GInterfaces in C#.
</I>
I have no argue with that. Still, I find data-binding
is an important feature because it can save a lot of
code &amp; time in many cases and many people are 
expecting it from a .Net GUI toolkit.
And so, I think some solution should be integrated to
Gtk# if possible. That is why I am asking for your
opinion and  not just implementing a TreeModel that
fits my project alone. Granted, it'd not be 100%
managed but still the benefit would outweigh the cost
IMHO.

Do you think such a feature cannot be integrated to
Gtk# before the 3 issues you've mentioned are solved,
or do you just not see it as a priority?
