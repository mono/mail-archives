<PRE>Anyone using release tarballs or packages for Gtk# need not read
further. This message is intended for people who are building Gtk# from
the subversion repository to track the bleeding edge.

The trunk branch in svn now supports both 1.9.x and 2.5.x release lines.
Since there are more similarities than differences between these two
bindings, and they are both unstable, I decided to produce them both
from the same branch instead of having to cross commit virtually every
patch to two branches.

This has introduced a minor change to the current svn build process.
Instead of the usual:

autogen.sh &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install

I have introduced a pair of bootstrap scripts to set your environment
for either 2.4 or 2.6 bindings.  If you do:

bootstrap &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install

You get a 2.5.x release installed.  bootstrap takes the same arguments
as autogen and configure did, so:

bootstrap --prefix=/opt/foo &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install

Is the way to get a prefixed installation.

If you want to build the 1.9.x release line, there is a bootstrap-2.4
command to set trunk up for it.  So you do:

bootstrap-2.4 --prefix=/opt/foo &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install

To get 2.4 bindings and a 1.9.x version.

Note, 1.9.x and 2.5.x are not parallel installable and there are no
plans to make them so.  We are just continuing to produce a parallel set
of unstable 2.4 binding releases to the current 2.5.x development
release to support people who want to use an unstable series on
platforms that don't yet support Gtk+ 2.6.

Before I get a lot of &quot;Why don't you do this?&quot; messages (especially from
you Ben), I'll try to explain my rational for the bootstrap process.

Q: Why not have configure detect the Gtk+ version and build the
appropriate binding?
A: Because I want to be able to distcheck tarballs for each version that
contain only the necessary files for that specific Gtk+ version.

Q: Why don't you have autogen detect which version of Gtk is installed
automatically?
A: Because I want to be able to compile/test both branches on a single
machine that has 2.6 installed.

Q: Why not have a single autogen script with an option for selecting the
binding version?
A: Because I'm lazy and the two bootstrap script approach was easier.
Besides, I don't think bootstrap-2.4 ...  is any less usable than
autogen.sh --version=2.4.  However, if somebody wanted to spend the time
to make a single autogen script that defaulted to the installed Gtk+
version but also allowed overriding of the choice, I am accepting
patches.  I've personally got more important fish to fry though.
