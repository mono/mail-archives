Thanks; I'm actually familiar with these.
 
A point worth making, though - one of the things you mention (no. 2) is a TreeModel which wraps a DataTable; IMHO this is conceptually incorrect as a bindable data table is represented by a DataView which as such implements the standard interfraces I was suggesting to rely on - IBindingList and ITypedList (of which, ITypedList is used also in sqkgtksharp AFAIK). Since these are generic interfaces relying on them is more correct &amp; powerful.

Here are some things that can help you implement data binding in a gtk# 
TreeView/ListStore
1. take a look at the work Duncan Mak did with NodeView/NodeStore. This 
has been part of GTk# for awhile.
2. take a look at the work Vladimir Vukicevic did with the managed tree 
model stuff. DataTreeModel I think.
3. take a look at sqlsharpgtk the svn - DataGrid.cs - this does not have 
true data binding, it is more like
data loading

There maybe other examples...

See how MonoDevelop or MonoQuery loads a TreeView/ListStore.
