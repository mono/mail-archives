Oh, thats the best part of writing a managed TreeModel implementation.
gtk+ would ask your TreeModel for the data, so you wouldn't have to do
much else to get it to work. In fact, Vlad has written a DataTableModel
that is all managed code that works using DataSet not ITypedList, if you
look at the archives to this list, I am sure you can find it.
