There is no plan to ever release 2.0, because if we did, we'd have to
keep it API stable, and so it would have to diverge from 2.5.

I am not Mike, but some issues I'm aware of are:

      * gnome-vfs-api.raw is currently &quot;wrong&quot;; if you run &quot;make api&quot; in
        sources/, it makes copious changes to gnome-vfs-api.raw. I don't
        know what happened to get it out of sync. (ie, if someone
        mistakenly removed stuff from gnome-vfs-api.raw rather than
        marking it hidden with metadata, or if new stuff has been made
        visible as a result of bugfixes to the parser, or what).
      * mcs and gapi-codegen give lots of warnings in gnome-vfs, some of
        which probably indicate real bugs.
      * I'm not sure how much use it's getting. (Maybe it's getting a
        lot and so this isn't a problem.) It would be good to get a
        handful of apps using it to make sure there is no lurking API
        ickiness that will be painful to deal with after we've committed
        to API stability. (Some of the bugs in bugzilla may tie into
        this, eg, the MimeAction problem.)
