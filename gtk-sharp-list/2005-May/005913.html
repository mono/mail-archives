</I>

The only way it would ever work with csc is to (ab)use Obsolete:

[Obsolete (&quot;This api is too new!&quot;)]

The cost of that would be:
      * You either turn off the obsolete warnings altogether and don't
        get the ones that are useful to you, or you get a spew of
        warnings
      * The error message is somewhat amusing

The other option would be:

[__GtkApiVersion (&quot;2.4&quot;)] and you pass mcs a -req-gtk 2.2 and it warns
if you use any new functionality. However, that clearly won't work on
csc.

We gain a bit of control here, at the cost of the thing working with
csc.
