</I>

The ability to implement GInterfaces and override virtual methods would
absolutely help with implementing a pure C# TreeModel implementation to
allow for nice and easy data-binding. However, it would still be
possible w/o it. You can actually look at the gtk# source for a
TreeModel implementation (NodeStore). One issue if you look at
NodeStore, is that the managed bit doesn't implement TreeModel, and this
ends up creating a lot of interesting issues, like the requirement of
NodeSelection, NodeCellDataFunc, and (somewhat) NodeView...

I think all of it is a priority, but I absolutely think that working to
allow *all* GInterface implementations gives you a lot more than writing
one-off hacks to implement a single GInterface once...
