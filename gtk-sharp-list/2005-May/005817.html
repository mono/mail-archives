<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Some things I find annoying  :
</I>&gt;<i> - It seems we had to use ListStore for TreeView.Model, and it seems
</I>&gt;<i> ListStore is a simple another list object... There is always many
</I>&gt;<i> lists types in System.Collections, why should we use another lis type
</I>&gt;<i> for treeview for instance ? An IList would be better, no ?
</I>
Actually the ListStore is not a simple list object, it is a fairly
elaborate &quot;storage&quot; for treemodels that happens to be flat.

The list/tree widget in Gtk# is actually always a tree.  But depending
on the model implementation it can behave as either a tree or a list.
ListStore is what makes the TreeView behave like a list of elements.

But I see what you want: you want to reuse the same IList API there.
Do you have a sample program that you could share with us that you would
like transformed into an IList-based sample?  That would help us.

&gt;<i> - I find some things very weird. To get the entry selected in a
</I>&gt;<i> TreeView, it seems we have to write an overcomplicated-for-the-job
</I>&gt;<i> code :
</I>&gt;<i> TreeIter iter;
</I>&gt;<i> TreeModel model;
</I>&gt;<i> TreeSelection sel = myTreeView.Selection;
</I>&gt;<i> if(sel.GetSelected(out model, out iter)) {
</I>&gt;<i>     int thing = (int)model.GetValue( iter, 5 );
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And so on.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A simple thing like that could not be possible ? :
</I>&gt;<i> int thing = (int) myTreeView.EntrySelected(5);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> or, even better, a thing like that :
</I>&gt;<i> MyObject my = (MyObject) myTreeView.EntrySelected();
</I>
This sounds like a useful addition, we could file a feature request, but
but there are two problems with your example:

	* What happens if there is nothing selected?  Should
	  we throw an exception?  I think that would be a bad idea.

	* What happens if you have multiple-selection enabled?

Perhaps the solution would be to have a method like this:

class TreeView {

	// Return an array of objects for each row.
	object [] GetSelected () {...}

	// Return the array of objects for a specific column
	object [] GetSelected (int column) { }
}
