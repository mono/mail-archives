<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Announcing the joint release of versions 2.5.5 and 1.9.5 of Gtk#.  These
</I>&gt;<i> releases are unstable development releases.  They are not
</I>&gt;<i> parallel-installable with each other, but either release can be
</I>&gt;<i> parallel-installed with the latest stable release.
</I>
We highly encourage people to *not* use features available in Gtk# 2.5.5
as that will limit the set of platforms where their code will be able to
run.

Both are compatible, but people should test and use Gtk# 1.9.5 if they
hope that their software will run on more than 10% of the available
installations available today.

Gtk# 2.5.5 depends on Gtk 2.6 which first shipped in GNOME 2.10 and very
few distributions have it.  This means that your users will not be able
to run your software until they have made a switch to GNOME 2.10.

Miguel.
</PRE>
