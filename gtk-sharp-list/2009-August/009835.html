</I>I agree, we have to keep that stuff out of Gtk#. It was a bad idea to 
implement IList support in the gtk-sharp assembly. Data binding and the 
bindings for Gtk+ should be seperated cleanly.
&gt;<i> and use it like
</I>&gt;<i> myTreeView.SetItems (myListOrDatabase);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Good idea :-) . The extension methods approach is still not optimal (we 
cannot add a constructor to the TreeModel-based widgets), but it is 
whole lot cleaner.

I wonder if that can be done without compiling the assembly against .net 
3.5. Apparently it seems to be possible to compile extension methods 
with the .net 2.0 profile, but any application wanting to use them will 
have to target 3.5, if I'm correct (though it would still be possible to 
call them as static methods).
&gt;&gt;<i> The second problem is there are existing databinding projects around. It 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will confuse a user of Gtk# DataBindings to see that TreeView has a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;List&quot; and a &quot;DataSource&quot; property. This is a collision that we would 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like to avoid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> this is why extension methods should be used for that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> for example:
</I>&gt;<i> my extension methods for databindings with original gtk widgets reside
</I>&gt;<i> in (v2 not yet in svn)
</I>&gt;<i> Gtk.DataBindings.Compatibility
</I>&gt;<i> which makes it possible for developer to use original widgets without
</I>&gt;<i> extensions even if he references to my assembly
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I agree. Let's keep all data binding stuff outside of the gtk-sharp 
assembly.
&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Matja&#7825; is currently working on a minimal, generic code base for data 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> binding support in Gtk# using extension methods. I'm excited about the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> results. Maybe the best choice would just be to wait until it is ready 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and see if we can possibly add it together with the IList stuff.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> I for one love that very much and would love if some light databinding

</I>&gt;<i> another assembly (if it would be in gtk#... then databinding interface
</I>&gt;<i> would have no meaning).
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Yes, data binding functionality has been neglected for quite some time. 
It is a part of a every good UI toolkit. I'm confident that we can add 
at least some basic stuff in its seperate assembly.
