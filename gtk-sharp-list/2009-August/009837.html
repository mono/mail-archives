</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree, we have to keep that stuff out of Gtk#. It was a bad idea to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implement IList support in the gtk-sharp assembly. Data binding and the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bindings for Gtk+ should be seperated cleanly.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and use it like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; myTreeView.SetItems (myListOrDatabase);

I personally like how the ListView in Hyena solves this solution [see
the thread at &lt;<A HREF="http://www.nabble.com/Re%">http://www.nabble.com/Re%</A>
3A-Sorting-and-Filtering-NodeStore-p20548458ef1367.html&gt;]  IMO, Banshee
has created some great, and under appreciated, Gtk# code.

&gt;<i> &gt; I wonder if that can be done without compiling the assembly against .net 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3.5. Apparently it seems to be possible to compile extension methods 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with the .net 2.0 profile, but any application wanting to use them will 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have to target 3.5, if I'm correct (though it would still be possible to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; call them as static methods).
</I>
Is targeting the current .NET rev really a problem?  Is anyone, in
practice, actually sticking to older revs?  Especially in regards to
shipping a new assembly with a new [?] API?

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I for one love that very much and would love if some light databinding
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; would be deployed with gtk-sharp. as long as it is extension and part of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; another assembly (if it would be in gtk#... then databinding interface
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; would have no meaning).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, data binding functionality has been neglected for quite some time. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It is a part of a every good UI toolkit. I'm confident that we can add 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at least some basic stuff in its seperate assembly.
</I>&gt;<i> lol????? Neglected? I wonder what have I been doing for almost 3 years;)
</I>
I assume we are talking about &lt;<A HREF="http://gtk-databind.sourceforge.net/">http://gtk-databind.sourceforge.net/</A>&gt; ?
