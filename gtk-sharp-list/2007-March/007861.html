<PRE>Hi,

Mono.Cairo.dll should be in the GAC. If not then the installer needs
updating (I think).

GTK's drawing is done via GDK (sort of like a common platform layer)
and Pango, so those should always be present on every GTK+ platform.
Since GTK+ 2.8 it also uses Cairo.

Also, the Gtk.DotNet namespace (not sure what assembly it's in)
provides a way to get a System.Drawing.Graphics context from
Gdk.Drawable, so you can actually use a Graphics object with GTK#.

&gt;<i> So I've worked my way around that with the built-in drawing routines

</I>&gt;<i> something. I'm completely stuck, and I was going so well!

</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone have an example of working cross-platform text drawing

</I>&gt;<i> help will be hugely appreciated.
</I>
Sorry, no examples as I've never done this myself, but I'm fairly
certain that Pango and Cairo are indeed the way to go.

You might have luck looking in the source code of an application like
Banshee for examples. Or you could try translating this from C:
