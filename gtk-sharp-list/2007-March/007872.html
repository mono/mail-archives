<PRE>Thanks again Michael. I've replied inline again, and I'm posting this 
back to the list for reference of people like me in the future.

Yep. I haven't installed Mono, just the Gtk# SDK 2.8.3. In any case, 
I seem to now be getting some crap on the screen, and it redraws on 
resize etc, so I must be getting close to having it going.

&gt;<i>Yep, the number of different and incompatible Windows and Contexts can

</I>&gt;<i>frequently, the compiler's strong typing should help to sort things
</I>&gt;<i>out...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I'm surprised that the VS code completion hasn't helped with this.
</I>
Code completion helps a lot, it's just not clear what's what - some 
CodeDOM comments would be immensely helpful ;-)

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;Also, the Gtk.DotNet namespace (not sure what assembly it's in)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;provides a way to get a System.Drawing.Graphics context from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;Gdk.Drawable, so you can actually use a Graphics object with GTK#.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>That wouldn't be cross-platform friendly though would it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Actually, Mono implements System.Drawing quite well, via a Cairo-based
</I>&gt;<i>GDI+ implementation. The main intention of this is to ease porting.
</I>
OK, so am I now likely to run into problems with the straight Gdk 
drawing routines I've got going? I still have to figure out exactly 
how to use Pango as well, although I am seeing some text floating in 
the top left corner of the window.

Well, I probably should say that I have managed to get a window 
layout, functioning toolbar and menu, and some manual drawing done 
within 2 working days of picking up the code - please don't take my 
comments as bitching, I am quite impressed with my overall progress 
despite getting snagged on some things I would have thought were 
easy. I myself probably should have figured out things like how 
Gtk.DrawingArea extends/contains Gdk.Window earlier, by reading more 
and coding less.

Now to figure out why everthing is black and how to interact with the mouse...

Cheers,

Aaron.
