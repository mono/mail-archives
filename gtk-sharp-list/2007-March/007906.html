No, I hadn't, thanks very much!

</I>
Cheers. I'd found the official docs but wasn't using them heaps 
because they were just API docs.

&gt;<i>Also, the GTK+ docs can be helpful even if they are more difficult to
</I>&gt;<i>interpret:     <A HREF="http://gtk.org/api/">http://gtk.org/api/</A> and <A HREF="http://gtk.org/tutorial/">http://gtk.org/tutorial/</A>
</I>
Yeah, that's where I've been getting most my information. :-(

&gt;<i>On Linux you could of course use MonoDevelop with its fantastic GTK# designer.
</I>
If I thought I had half a chance of getting portaudio, libsndfile and 
so forth to compile under Linux, and if I had an understanding of how 
to set up a project/installer under Linux, I'd seriously consider 
switching to that for my main development platform. Windows is still 
my target audience for now though.

&gt;<i>There has been some work on it, but it's not a priority at all as
</I>&gt;<i>there are plenty of .NET IDEs for Win32. Anyhow, if GTK# is that
</I>&gt;<i>unstable on your machine it wouldn't be much good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>However, I'm sure GTK# is not generally this unstable on Windows.
</I>&gt;<i>Something must be up with your installation. Try a complete purge of
</I>&gt;<i>GTK# and GTK+, then try the MedSphere GTK# installer.
</I>
I definitely will... OK, looks like GAIM's installation of Gtk might 
have been part of the problem. I'm having trouble getting it to 
uninstall. Now that I've installed the Medsphere version, my app will 
compile, but none of the samples will run... Argh, I've gotta clean 
out the GAC. Can't see any references to add in VS2005...

I'll get back to you. I might have to start with a fresh VMWare 
machine and verify it's not something I've done previously.

I know people who use Linux all the time are good at getting all the 
bits and pieces going, but for Windows users it's important to keep 
the dependencies down. I gave choosing Gtk a great deal of thought 
and its important that whatever I do it only involves installing 
.NET2.0/Mono and Gtk#. I really hope this works because you guys are 
the only option - last night I reconfirmed that Qt, WxWidgets and 
Fltk are all definitely a no-go. :-(

&gt;<i>C++/CLI won't run on Mono.
</I>
Damn. If I could slip in some managed C++ my options would be a lot more open.

Thank you *very* much for your reply.

Aaron.
