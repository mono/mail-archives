<PRE>Hi Luciano,

OK thanks, but believe me I've been looking all over the place for 
this sort of information - the samples, the Gtk+ API reference, 
postings to this list, Google, Mono Project site ... I didn't find 
this, and you can do ScrolledWindow.Add(TextView), I've done it myself.

I certainly can't find antything about calling widget functions from 
within handlers causing a crash or failing to work. I was hoping 
someone would test the code and verify my results. I get the same 
sort of results populating one treeview when another's cursor moves.

Something I didn't mention last night is that whatever this is, it 
crashed GAIM. You can say what you like about my crappy code, but I 
shouldn't be able to crash other apps runing on Gtk no matter what I 
do... right?

&gt;<i>The other problem i don't know, but, maybe are you working with 
</I>&gt;<i>Multi-Threading operations?
</I>
I am, but these threads have been working for a long time without 
problems, as has my communication philosophy under winforms. The 
crashes are always in Gtk code and always in the windowing thread, 
even in places like Application.Run().

All thread communication is done with simple one-way 
wordvalue-writing. Do I have to lock the widgets I access in a 
Timeout callback or something? I'll get back to you with more info - 
I'm slowly disabling things so I can track down the problem.
