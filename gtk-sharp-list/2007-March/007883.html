<PRE>Hi,

Seeing as I've dabbed in multi-threading myself (albeit not with that 
much success), I can point you to 
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Responsive_Applications.">http://www.mono-project.com/Responsive_Applications.</A>

If you search through the various threading issues described previously 
in this list, it seems that the Gtk.Application.Invoke(delegate {...}) 
path is the most favored (also covered in the &quot;Responsive Applications&quot; 
article).

Hope this helps,

Walter

</I>&gt;<i> Also, the table layout seems to be playing up very badly. I declare an Nx3 table and fill it up

</I>&gt;<i> hints or Show vs ShowAll. I'm struggling a lot with this completely uncontrollable layout
</I>&gt;<i> philosophy - is there really no way to control the relative proportions of components as they
</I>&gt;<i> scale? It seems that if I create two thin columns and one fat one, stretching the window leaves me
</I>&gt;<i> with three columns of equal width.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apologies for posting even more newbie questions, thanks in advance for any help.
