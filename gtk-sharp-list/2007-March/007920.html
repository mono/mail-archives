The &quot;cilc&quot; CIL-to-C binding generator tool which ships with Mono has 
explicit GObject support. This means that it can tie a Gtk# widget 
subclass into the Gtk+ object hierarchy. Some areas like event-to-signal 
mapping, interfaces and properties aren't that well tested but it more 
than works as proof of concept.

I think that if you channel the time saved by writing widgets in C# back 
into cilc and submit the patches, you would save time overall and help 
bring a neat little tool to the wider developer community.
