<PRE>I *think* that gtk# is specifically targeted at .NET 1.1 at this point
still, so I think using it with .NET 2.0 might still be a &quot;at your own
risk&quot; type of thing.  I have used it with VS2005 Professional, but in
one or two places the runtime would emit a StackImbalanceException in
some of my custom widgets' drawing code.  Using all stock widgets, I
don't think I ever received any.  I never tried using VS2005 Express,
but it seems like that should behave the same as Professional.

I mostly use gtk# right now on VS2003 Professional, where it runs just
fine.  But that's not .NET 2.0.
