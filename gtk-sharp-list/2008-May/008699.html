<PRE>&gt;<i> Sound's exciting, I've never done a control like that.  Any winforms
</I>&gt;<i> calendar control that you've seen and like ?
</I>
There are several commercial ones.  The only Open Source one I've seen
was with &quot;monocalendar&quot;  which is unmaintained, and possibly incomplete.
I originally based mine very roughly off their code.

Commercials ones are &lt;<A HREF="http://www.dbi-tech.com/dbiCalendar.asp">http://www.dbi-tech.com/dbiCalendar.asp</A>&gt; and here
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/WinForms/XtraScheduler/">http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/WinForms/XtraScheduler/</A>&gt;

&gt;<i> I will add it for sure in my todo list for the 2.0 version of holly-widgets.
</I>&gt;<i> If you are an adept with Gtk# and would be willing to take a look at our use
</I>&gt;<i> of Gtk#'s ... calendar widget code and to offer us concrete suggestions to
</I>&gt;<i> make it better/faster we'd almost certainly be willing to send you
</I>&gt;<i> pizza/beverage-of-your-choice! 
</I>
I'm certainly not!  I've muddle through, on a good day.  But I'm
certainly willing to co-operate with anyone on making a decent calendar.

Basically I'm just trying to make something that displays n-number of
days and unto which events can be placed.  The widget handles the
packing for overlapping events (what I find to be the really hard part).
Events can be dragged around and right-clicked for a context menu.
Dragging is crude but it works.  The ability to set event color and
possibly an icon would be nice.   Multi-day events currently work.   It
might be better if each event was its own event box - not sure.

This calendar is in its own DLL,  code is at
&lt;<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/consonance/source/browse">http://code.google.com/p/consonance/source/browse</A>&gt;  in the
trunk/Gtk/Calendar folder.
