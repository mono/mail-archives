&gt;&gt;<i> Sound's exciting, I've never done a control like that.  Any winforms
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> calendar control that you've seen and like ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are several commercial ones.  The only Open Source one I've seen
</I>&gt;<i> was with &quot;monocalendar&quot;  which is unmaintained, and possibly incomplete.
</I>&gt;<i> I originally based mine very roughly off their code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Commercials ones are &lt;<A HREF="http://www.dbi-tech.com/dbiCalendar.asp">http://www.dbi-tech.com/dbiCalendar.asp</A>&gt; and here
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/WinForms/XtraScheduler/">http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/WinForms/XtraScheduler/</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I will add it for sure in my todo list for the 2.0 version of holly-widgets.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you are an adept with Gtk# and would be willing to take a look at our use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of Gtk#'s ... calendar widget code and to offer us concrete suggestions to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make it better/faster we'd almost certainly be willing to send you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pizza/beverage-of-your-choice!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm certainly not!  I've muddle through, on a good day.  But I'm
</I>&gt;<i> certainly willing to co-operate with anyone on making a decent calendar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Basically I'm just trying to make something that displays n-number of
</I>&gt;<i> days and unto which events can be placed.  The widget handles the
</I>&gt;<i> packing for overlapping events (what I find to be the really hard part).
</I>&gt;<i> Events can be dragged around and right-clicked for a context menu.
</I>&gt;<i> Dragging is crude but it works.  The ability to set event color and
</I>&gt;<i> possibly an icon would be nice.   Multi-day events currently work.   It
</I>&gt;<i> might be better if each event was its own event box - not sure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This calendar is in its own DLL,  code is at
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/consonance/source/browse">http://code.google.com/p/consonance/source/browse</A>&gt;  in the
</I>&gt;<i> trunk/Gtk/Calendar folder.
</I>
Pimlico Dates [1] has a pretty good calendar widget in GTK, with
several level of view : date, week, year.  Unfortunately it's written
in C, but it might be easier to port it to GTK# or create a binding
than recreating a whole new widget.
