Then checking on lost focus seems like the most appropriate thing to
do.  Note that when I say validate, I do *not* mean the type of
validation that pops up horribly annoying dialog boxes on failure.
(We have stuff like that where I work.  I could rant about it for
days.)  I'm talking about the kind of validation that will annotate
invalid fields with some indicator and disable all mechanisms that
could be used to submit the form (like the Accept button).  Clicking
the indicator could provide further explanation in a dialog.

An even better idea would be to keep the error messages short and
display them below the field itself.

I'm not sure how doing this on-blur would be an issue.
