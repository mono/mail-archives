About Gtk#: 
Gtk# is C# language binding for the Gtk+ Graphical User Interface
toolkit. Well, that's understating it a bit. It's really a set of
classes in IL assemblies which can theoretically be accessed by any .Net
compatible language. To this date, Gtk# has been seen in the wild under
the control of C# and LOGO code. People are now starting to do
significant things with Gtk#, but it is still largely unproven and not
recommended for production work. 

Changes since 0.2: 
- Better GInterface support (rachel)
- Preliminary Docs: docs are not distributed, but can be accessed from
the Gtk# homepage (rachel)
- Dialog, Paned, ColorSelectionDialog, and FileSelection enhancements
and customizations. (duncan)
- Test samples: Duncan has been systematically exercising the binding,
finding holes, and reporting bugs. Check out his work in sample/test.
- DBClient sample app for Gtk# based database access. (Gonzalo and
Duncan)
- Enum support for GValues (rachel)
- Ctor collision resolutions (rachel)
- Binding of the GtkHTML widget (mkestner)
- Binding of libgnome, libgnomeui, and libgnomecanvas (rachel)
- GnomeHelloWorld sample (rachel)
- Null parameter support (rachel)
- Typed event handlers with EventArgs subclasses for compile time
typesafe signal parameter access. (mkestner)
- Default constructor customization support and ScrolledWindow
customizations. (Radek)
- Opaque structure support in the parser: (mkestner)
- static method parsing and generation: (mkestner)
- structure marshaling support: (rachel)
- Gdk Drawable binding (rachel)
- Prefer property accessor methods instead of GObject
properties.(mkestner)
