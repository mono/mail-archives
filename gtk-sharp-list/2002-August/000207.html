<PRE>Hello guys,

    I have been working on a small image viewing application, whose main
purpose in life is to scale to show thousands of images, so I had to
write a new icon list that would have such a set of features.  

    The hard work of loading images and creating thumbnails is done in a
separate thread, to allow people to look at images while the thumbnails
are either extracted from the .JPG file or generated from scratch.

    The issue I am running into is that I need to signal my Gtk thread
that it should repaint the images that have just been loaded, or whose
quality has been improved.

    So what I need is that my worker thread (who can not do any Gtk
calls) wake up the main thread and let the main thread pick up the
results.    My plan is to use a pipe, and use the pipe to &quot;wakeup&quot; a
callback on the Gtk thread:

    What I would need is:

	* GIOChannel support, so I can create a GIOChannel and
	  a way of registering a delegate with it.

	  or

	* gtk_input_add_full/gdk_input_remove

   That would make me very very happy.

Miguel
