I have no issues with trying to make it more easily reusable, but I
don't want to move it to a separate module. 

&gt;<i> Code changes in generator:

This is just an optimization that can avoided when multiple namespaces
aren't being generated.

&gt;<i>   * XML file should be split up into per-namespace files. Generator
</I>&gt;<i>     should accept additional XML files as &quot;dependencies&quot; for the current
</I>&gt;<i>     assembly (we need the full hierarchy to create code). Bindings
</I>&gt;<i>     should install their XML files to a datadir so that other bindings
</I>&gt;<i>     may depend on them. (This is done with .defs files too in a similar
</I>&gt;<i>     manner.)
</I>
Yeah, good idea.

&gt;<i>   * SymbolTable hacks should be loaded at runtime from XML files. Once
</I>&gt;<i>     multiple files are accepted, it will be easy enough to have
</I>&gt;<i>     (automatically generated) gtkapi.xml and (hand-written)
</I>&gt;<i>     gtk-symboltable.xml.
</I>
Based on a discussion with mmarker on IRC, maybe this could have helped
him avoid doing his hack/slash job for glgen.

&gt;<i>   * Introspection mapping needs to be fixed to be generic:
</I>&gt;<i>      The mapping table should be extendable. Wasn't the final decision
</I>&gt;<i>      on IRC that we put the registration code in wherever the assembly
</I>&gt;<i>      has an &quot;init&quot; func? (Gnome.Modules, Gtk.Application, etc).
</I>
I did it the simple way, because I discovered the beauty of
Activator.CreateInstance() with fully qualified (including assembly)
type names.

&gt;<i> Glib is moved to its own module
</I>&gt;<i>   There are an increasing number of gobject-based projects out there,
</I>&gt;<i> such as gstreamer, that would only really depend on glib-sharp.dll. This
</I>&gt;<i> module wouldn't even need code-generation because the only stuff in
</I>&gt;<i> generated/ is signals (see my earlier point.)
</I>
Nah.  Let's just start installing the generator and parser.  If any
purists are offended enough by the presence of gtk-sharp.dll, they can
add a configure flag to stop the make at glib.
