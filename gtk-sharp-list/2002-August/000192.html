Great.  This is without a doubt the best way to help Gtk# right now. 
There is a huge amount of API wrapped already that has never been
executed.  Duncan is doing a great job of finding bugs, but I'm sure
he'd welcome the help.  :)

We must be doing something right then.  :)

I'd like to encourage everyone to open bugzilla bugs for problems they
find if it is not a trivial obvious fix.  Patches in diff -u, preferably
against current cvs would be great.  Patches can be attached directly to
the bugs.

Let me know if I can help you get started. I look forward to seeing your
patches.  :)

Mike
