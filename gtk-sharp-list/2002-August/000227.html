I reply to this mail just because it brings up one issue I'm worried
about in the Gtk# API.
I think GList and GSList should not be exposed in the public Gtk# API.
They are ugly as hell and should be only used to interface to the
library: the types exposed should be plain arrays or ArrayLists.
The same goes for other internal details of the Gtk+ C API, like, the
use of IntPtr.Zero should be never required to write a Gtk# program, it
just doesn't belong to a C# interface. Also, eliminating it will give
us some chance of using Gtk# in untrusted code.

Uhm, didn't I say I had one issue?
Well, I have also a third: C# won't be the only language to use the
binding to Gtk. I would be nice to have the binding be a thin wrapper of
the C API and have Gtk# on top of that to provide the C#-way of doing
things, while other languages will be able to reuse the binding to
implement the interface to their language as best as it suits _that_
language.

Ok, I'm done, flame away.
