</I>
Beats me!  :) I'm not a Banshee developer,  I just found a BLOG post
about how much he/she/they [don't recall] dislike TreeView while looking
for how on earth you get TreeView to... I don't know.... work.   So it
has been on my list of things to try out.   Would probably be best to
try and just lift the widget parts out into a separate assembly since it
doesn't feel like it is really setup for general use.  Maybe start a
project called &quot;Stolen Widgets&quot; or &quot;Red Hot Widgets&quot; on Google Code. :)
There are other Gtk# that need plundering as well;  the calendar view
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.iola.dk/nemo/">http://www.iola.dk/nemo/</A>&gt; from nemo, for example.

&gt;<i> It seems that way given how long these files have sat around.
</I>
I assume that.   I generally disregard commit comments,  especially when
dealing with code that itself doesn't have *any* inline comments at all.

&gt;<i> Also, would it make sense to allow right clicks?  This is very handy
</I>&gt;<i> for adding context menus.  It is all done in code by creating
</I>&gt;<i> MenuItems right now, but one could probably associate actions to the
</I>&gt;<i> widget for a nice generic context menu display.  This code was mostly
</I>&gt;<i> stolen from somewhere.  Anything I added is as free as it was
</I>&gt;<i> before...
</I>&gt;<i> On line 461 of ListView.cs.
</I>&gt;<i> if(evnt.Button == 3) {
</I>&gt;<i>   OnMouseButtonClick(new MouseButtonPressedEventArgs(evnt));
</I>&gt;<i>   return true;
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>
OnPopupMenu only fires if right button was clicked and an item is
selected.  So it essentially does this.  One can, of course, connect a
button press event handler using ConnectBefore and override the default
behaviour.   But the processing of a button click/release on the widget
actually turns out to be pretty complicated.  Since you must inherit
from ListView&lt;T&gt; anyway just performing an override of OnPopupMenu seems
correct,  your OnPopupMenu could invoke an event handler if that suits
the purpose.

public EventHandler PopupDelegate;

&#65279;protected override bool OnPopupMenu()
{
  if (&#65279;PopupDelegate == null) return false;
  &#65279;PopupDelegate(....
}

&gt;<i> Oh and don't forget
</I>&gt;<i>  public event EventHandler MouseButtonClicked;
</I>
I don't know,  you can already attach a press/release handler, it is
widget after all.  The Hyena ListView provides a much higher-level model
of RowActivated, SelectionChanged, and PopupMenu events which is what,
IMO,  applications want 99.999999% of the time.   My little demo code
certainly doesn't demonstrate everything the ListView supports.
