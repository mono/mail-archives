<PRE>I have been trying to get monodevelop to run on OpenSolaris.  I have 
finally busted through to success.  However, what I discovered along the 
way is that when building/installing gtk-sharp on a 64-bit machine is 
very troublesome because the generated Makefiles for gtk-sharp did not 
have CFLAGS correctly.  Specifically, eventhough I had the same 
environment variables set, including CFLAGS=-m64 for building mono and 
everything else, for some reason for all the Makefiles in gtk-sharp -m64 
was not added to the list of flags.  I have no idea why, since I have 
only finally discovered the problem.  Anyhow, I added (manually) -m64 to 
  each Makefile and monodevelop launched.  I would love to not have to 
make this change by hand again, and if anyone has a clue on what the fix 
could be please let me know.  Hopefully, we can get this straightened 
out and have gtk-sharp on OpenSolaris.

  Thanks, Zak
