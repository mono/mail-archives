<PRE>The Medsphere 2.12 installer that he cited as working includes version
2.0 of Mono.Cairo as well.  The reason I did this was because our build
box (running Mono in Linux) has version 2 installed, and when we began
upgrading products to use .NET 2.0 then we were running into problems
running the Linux-built binaries on Windows using .NET for some reason.

I don't remember the error exactly right now, but basically when we
build with Mono.Cairo 2.0 then .NET seems to expect that version exactly
or something.

Maybe the correct solution was for us to remove version 2 from our build
box?  I don't know, it seems like there was a reason to not do that but
I can't think of it now.
