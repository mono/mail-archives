I can't think of any examples of exactly this, but the basic idea is
that you're just implementing a special container that only sometimes
shows its child and shows it at different positions.

Because you're only using the child in a very limited way, you can
probably just subclass Bin and stuff the child in that, so it does the
bulk of work of propagating mapping, realization, destroying, etc. to
the child. Then, on the expose event of your widget, you have to check
the child state depending on the state of your widget. You may have to
set its visible state, or give it a requisition if its position has
changed, then propagate the expose. Or you could subclass Alignment,
and use the xpad/ypad to handle the positioning. Then you'd just have
to handle giving your widget a GdkWindow and overriding the expose and
allocation like usual. Just make sure you make the PropagateExpose
calls so the child is exposed too.

Something like that, anyway.

I think the Medsphere GTK# widget have some containers written in
managed code you could look at.
