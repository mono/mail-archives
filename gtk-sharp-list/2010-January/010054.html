Since C# objects both have getHashCode() method and the Tag property,
arguments, that they are 'not
the &quot;C# way&quot; to do it' doesn't just feel right to me.

Another note, that the C# 2.0 way (as stated by the guy (I forgot his name)
who led the .net 2.0 framework development back then) is following the so
called '80-20 rule'. Which means that 80% of the functionality are there to
be easily usable, and fasten the development, while allowing to do
everything possible, in the remaining 20%. So we can actually do everything,
we could have done in native code. Like we have unmanaged pointers in
.net2.0.
So the &quot;C# way&quot; in my opinion is: Being able to most of the things easily,
while being able to do everything.
That's why C# is my favourite more than five years now.

By the way, I actually looking for a winForms Tag like functionality for
libglade gui file.
Is it possible to define some text or number in a glade file which get's
readable in C# code using gtk# and glade#?

Greets,
Andrew
