If this is on Linux, you can capture the screen in lock mode simply by
capturing the screen as usual.  However, &quot;log off mode&quot; means there is
no current user X session.  Connecting to the display manager's X
session will require root access, and an unconventional set of
environment variables.

If this is on Linux, you're screwed from the start.  Windows has
security measures in place to prevent tampering with the lock/log-in
environments since this could be exploited to capture user passwords.
