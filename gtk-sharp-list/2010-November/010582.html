I'm nobody official, or even particularly reputable, but there was a
thread about this back in March.
&lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/gtk-sharp-list/2010-March/010135.html">http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/gtk-sharp-list/2010-March/010135.html</A>&gt;

It includes the quote:
Also note that we have not made any commitments to release a Gtk# 3.0 in
September.  If the gtk+ 3.0 release happens in September it is probably
more likely a Gtk# binding for it would come next Spring.  

Although, March was a l-o-n-g time ago as these things go.

As for Glade; wasn't that deprecated a long time ago?  Apps are now
supposed to use GtkBuilder.

Q: Will Gtk+ 3.0 break Stetic?

A: Don't know; but I doubt it. Static doesn't use any real deep magic.
Just partial classes an a virtual method.

Q: Are there any breaking changes in Gtk+ 3.0 that will break Gtk#?

A: My understanding is that there will be minor breakage.  As to be
expected in a major version bump.

Q: Does Gtk# follow the Gtk+ / Gnome releases?

A: Sometimes

Q: can we finally get some generic collections, LINQ to Gtk# controls,
data binding?

A: Heh, I wouldn't hold my breath.  I hope it happens but even if it
does no one will tell us about it.  There are already some nice bits out
there in assemblies like Banshee's Hyena.  But you are totally on your
own in figuring out how to use them.  Writing documentation is
*HARD*.... therefore very few people do so; and with Open Source nobody
is paying them too... so the documentation is scant, crappy, and
out-of-date.

Q: Is it possible for Gtk# to start using Gtk+ Introspection instead of
Gapi?

A: I'm not certain what this question is asking.
