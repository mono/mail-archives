<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> More examples of the infamous &quot;pointer to simple type&quot; bug.  I will get
</I>&gt;<i> around to fixing that some day.  Until then, feel free to overload the
</I>&gt;<i> methods in .custom files, like the dozens of other such cases.  Putting
</I>&gt;<i> a note on the bug would be good too so we can make sure its fix works
</I>&gt;<i> everywhere and can remove the hand customizations.
</I>
Thanks for the information.  I have added a couple of new .custom
constructors, and updated the docs.

&gt;<i> Yep, since there's no Gdk.RGB type, there's nothing to assign the
</I>&gt;<i> methods to.  The parser is typedef driven, and we don't currently
</I>&gt;<i> include any methods not directly attributable to a type.  GdkRGB looks
</I>&gt;<i> like a candidate for a non-instantiable class with static methods.  I
</I>&gt;<i> suppose a bug report would be good to see that the parser handles this
</I>&gt;<i> case eventually.
</I>
Well, I am not sure it is worth the pain to implement, but it would be
good to have its methods exposed.  I will file a bug to have a &quot;.custom&quot;
or some file to include it.


&gt;<i> Well, technically any ctor could return NULL, so we should probably be
</I>&gt;<i> guarding all PInvoked ctors with a similar check.  The only question is
</I>&gt;<i> what exception to throw. Maybe a GLibSharp.ObjectConstructionException
</I>&gt;<i> or something like that. 10 minute hack to generator/Ctor.cs.
</I>
I think that we should only do this for constructors that have a high
degree of probability in failing.   For example, a couple of the Pixbuf
ones might fail due to memory requirements.

&gt;<i> &gt; 	* GetFromImage and GetFromDrawable both allow the first argument
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	  to be NULL (ie, they are really factories for Pixbufs, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	  we are exposing them as instance methods).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	  If nobody minds, I can add the .custom changes to have Factory
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	  versions of them.  The only problem is that the API would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	  the same between instance and static versions of the method. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	  So maybe they will need new names.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	  I can do this if Mike does not mind.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not at all. Please do.  :)
</I>
I created and documented a new method CreateFromDrawable.

&gt;<i> &gt; 	* Pixbuf.Copy should probably be Pixbuf.Clone, and we could have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	  Pixbuf implement the IClonable interface.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd leave Copy alone and have Clone call it.
</I>
I implemented and documented, but how do I make the Pixbuf class list
&quot;ICloneable&quot; as an interface it implements?


&gt;<i> &gt; 	  places.  We could make the API more C#-ish, if we used the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	  System.Drawing Colors as arguments.  We could have overloads
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	  for this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another good customization.
</I>
Perfect!  Just added two method overloads, and documented them.

&gt;<i> &gt; 	I can do this if Mike does not mind:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	Constructor based on gdk_pixbuf_new_subpixbuf 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 		Currently the API requires a Pixbuf to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 		created first, and then this function can be invoked.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 		It is not entirely obvious, I would like to have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 		a Subpixbuf method that would achieve the same.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not exactly sure what you're getting at here.  A static Subpixbuf
</I>&gt;<i> method?
</I>
Yes, a static Subpixbuf method, which makes it obvious what the
operation is.  Maybe it is not necessary though.

Miguel
