Hi=20

I have been looking at the content of the mailing list for the past few =
weeks and it seems there is a lot of interesting code comming in and out =
of the forums. Also a lot of questions / solutions are comming in and =
out however all this data is being lost in the archieves as they grow. =
As well as any code samples that people submit these are lot within the =
archieves.

I am interested in starting a forum where uses can post Q / A type =
questions... sort of what they have at www.ASP.NET . Just so that we can =
store a lot more of the code comming through as well as have a nice =
searchable archieve of information.

If you think this is feasible please reply ;-)

Regards
Piotr Stulinski
