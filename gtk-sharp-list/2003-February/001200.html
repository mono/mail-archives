The samples of the tutorial are more tutorial-focused, and will probably
touch on various things.

That being said, I think we should have a few samples in the
documentation, because I feel that is a bug in general with Gtk
documentation: that looking up the docs has never helped someone who is 
a newcomer start to write code.

&gt;<i> At the very least, I think it would be great to be able to refer/display a full sample from the API docs.

</I>
I am open to any ideas an changes about this.   But please keep in mind
that this is no substitute for small code snippets that show the
functionality of the class.

&gt;<i> Does the monodoc browser currently have facilities for displaying/rendering full code examples? 
</I>&gt;<i> If so, we could probably just pull in referenced files from sample/ when running 'make' in doc/ 
</I>
If it does not, we should make sure it does.  It is very easy to handle
(it requires XSLT work, but that is all it needs).

Pulling automatically samples from the disk is something am not too
excited about.  For technical reasons and because it does not blend
nicely into the explanation for a single method, single class.

In .NET they have a separate section called `QuickStart' that has
pointers to these, for separate tasks.
