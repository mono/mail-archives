Actually I went back and reverted to the code I had before and the
application didn't die but I got an error that 
gtk_tree_selection_get_selected failed which actually is described in
the gtk docs:

gtk_tree_selection_get_selected ()
gboolean    gtk_tree_selection_get_selected (GtkTreeSelection *selection,
                                             GtkTreeModel **model,
                                             GtkTreeIter *iter);

Sets iter to the currently selected node if selection is set to
GTK_SELECTION_SINGLE or GTK_SELECTION_BROWSE. iter may be NULL if you
just want to test if selection has any selected nodes. model is filled
with the current model as a convenience. This function will not work if
you use selection is GTK_SELECTION_MULTIPLE.
