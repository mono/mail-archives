Ya... that sounds like a good idea.

I disagree.  IMO, this is the way a GNOME application should be created.
(I.e., all GNOME applications should subclass Gnome.Program.)

The reason I think this is the case is so that you can use polymorphism,
and have your Main() procedure, or whatever, be untouched by any
change in your GNOME UI.

*cough* *cough*  That's why I created that patch for 
&quot;gnome/Program.custom&quot;.  That way I could &quot;override&quot; the Run()
method, and do even more polymorphism.  (It seems stupid that
I have to create a new method called run() to take the place
of Run().)

I know it probably comes down to a matter of style.  But I think
the reader should get exposed to this style too.  (And then they
can choose.)

What I could probably do is put the &quot;fourth try&quot; and &quot;fifth try&quot;
in a separate tutorial.  (That's actually what I was thinking
originally.)

That way the reader could still learn about this.  While the first
tutorial would only contain the very basics.

What do you think??


&gt;<i> 4th and 5th tries as I indicated above would go away, since they aren't
</I>&gt;<i> really specific to programming in GNOME.Net. If you wanted to go beyond
</I>&gt;<i> the second pass example, I would suggest doing something like packing an
</I>&gt;<i> Entry, Label, and Button into an App window such that when the button is
</I>&gt;<i> clicked, the Label is updated to: &quot;Hello &lt;contents of Entry&gt;, welcome to
</I>&gt;<i> GNOME.Net.  That's not really GNOME specific though, and is probably
</I>&gt;<i> better suited for an extended Gtk# example.
</I>
Putting stuff inside the GNOME Application Window is something I'm 
planning for a future separate tutorial.  (I wanted a separate tutorial
that would focus on the .Contents attribute.)

I want each tutorial to take very simple steps.  That way a beginner
programmer could get started with GNOME.NET.  (And not just someone
who is simply a beginner at Gtk#.)


See ya
