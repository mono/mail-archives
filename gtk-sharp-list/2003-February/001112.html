The problem is that woody is getting a little long in the tooth and
doesn't come with many of the dependencies that non-core Gtk# bindings
need. For example, the libraries for the Gtk+ 2.0 Glade and GNOME 2.0
aren't in woody, so we can't depend on them.

Having said this, there are a number of unofficial GNOME 2.2
repositories becoming available, including one at debianplanet.org. Once
the dust settles down, it might be possible to depend on the GNOME
library versions from this archive, but there would have to be more
evidence that people really do want Glade# and Gnome# bindings on woody.

Of course, the complete set of bindings is always available if you
switch to sid..
