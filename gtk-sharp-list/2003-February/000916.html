It's nice to see the documentation effort gaining a little steam
recently.  Thank you Charles, for pushing out this draft and getting the
ball rolling.  I haven't had an opportunity to review this properly yet,
but can I make a couple of high level observations?

I hate the term Gnome#.  Mainly because I've been asked a few dozen too
many times &quot;Why are the Gnome libraries in Gtk#.  Shouldn't they be in
their own Gnome# module?  Yada, yada, yada.&quot;  :-)  

Early on, the tutorial folks were using the term Gnome.Net.  I like that
nomenclature a lot.  I think it would be *awesome* to have a Gnome.Net
tutorial, complete with samples like this Hello World sample, with the
samples written in both C# and VB.Net, like most of the sample code in
the MS docs.

Of course, beggers can't be choosers, and you can feel free to tell me
to go scratch, but I'd really like to see a tutorial written like that. 
I will review your draft and provide feedback on it, and thanks again
for stepping up and filling this void.

Regards,
