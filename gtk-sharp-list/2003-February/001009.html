Relax, it was meant to inject a little humour.  I'm well aware that with
power comes complexity.  It's not the widget, it's the lack of
documentation and that will come in time I'm sure.  It's just
frustrating trying to figure all this stuff out.  It seems one of the
things about Linux and GUI programing is: there is never complete
documentation and while other code examples work in many cases everyone
codes differently and not always in a way another can easily figure out.

I see no one has jumped in with a quick example so I assume it may not
be trivial  Ah well off to do more reading.
