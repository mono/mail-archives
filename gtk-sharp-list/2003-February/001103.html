<PRE>Hello!

&gt;<i> I think while the project is still growing we would just use a php/mysql
</I>&gt;<i> forum solution it would just be a nice way of doing a lot of needed
</I>&gt;<i> questions and answer sections that currently are flowing in the mailing
</I>&gt;<i> list. I was just looking at the grow of the mailing list in the last few
</I>&gt;<i> months and it is growing tremedously quickly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A forum that contained ordered sections for the various problems people are
</I>&gt;<i> currently experiencing:
</I>&gt;<i> Eg:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     1) General Information
</I>&gt;<i>     2) Installation Problems / Errors
</I>&gt;<i>     3) Compile Problems / Errors
</I>&gt;<i>     4) Programming / API Questions and Answers
</I>&gt;<i>     5) User Tutorials / Quickstarts / Source Code
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The initial board setup easy however if the project continues to grow at the
</I>&gt;<i> rate it has been moderators will be needed ofcourse.
</I>
A piece of software that we desperately need is one to manage the
documentation process.   How can people &quot;register&quot; for authoring a
class, and allow others to see who is working on what, and so on.

Our current effort is being hampered by lack of good tools.  We are
currently using a bugzilla bug to track things, and we depend on people
posting there or on the mailing lists things like `Am doing XXX' 

Such a site would help here.  A feature we could implement is a
`timeout' feature.  In which we would return to the pool of undocumented
classes those that have been claimed, but never contributed to.

Miguel.
