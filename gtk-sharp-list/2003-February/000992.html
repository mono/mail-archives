Notice that this constructor has a &quot;protected&quot; access level.  That
means that others can't call it.

I'd guess that this is declared so that C# doesn't automagically create
a default constructor for us.  In other words, if we did not create
a constructor with the signature:

    HBox()

ourselves.  Then C# would create one for us.  And the one it
created would be &quot;public&quot;.  And others would be able to call it.
(Which we don't want.  So we created one ourselves that was 
&quot;protected&quot;.)

(Although, if we don't want other to call it, I'd probably make
it &quot;private&quot; instead of &quot;protected&quot;.  But then again, if you didn't
do that then subclasses of it couldn't call it.  I don't know if
that is important or not though.  Mike, is it???)


See ya
