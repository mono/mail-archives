Hello Mike,

Yes, Johannes and I are working on a Windows Installer for GTK# 0.8.

We are using NSIS (NullSoft Installer System)
instead of FreeExtractor now.
<A HREF="http://nsis.sourceforge.net">http://nsis.sourceforge.net</A>

We are using their nightly version at:
<A HREF="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/nightly/nsis.zip">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/nightly/nsis.zip</A>

It has scripting capabilities.  Basically, you unzip the arhive somewhere,
you create your script, like mono.nsi, and you run it from
the command-line like:

makensis.exe mono.nsi

I'm basing the GTK# installer off the Mono 0.20 installer.

The GTK# installer will have the option to install the
pkgconfig files (atk.pc, etc...) and gtk+ header files too.  This way, it
will
make it easier for people to later build gtk# from source or from cvs. :-)

Right now, I just need to figure out how to write a NSIS script
to change a path from C:\mono-0.20\install to C:/mono-0.20/install so
I can put that in the target of the pkgconfig files like atk.pc.  Currently,
I'm creating the the pkgconfig files in $INSTALLDIR\lib\pkgconfig.

I'm also using the old Windows Installer for GTK# 0.6 for its gtk+ 2.0
stuff.

Daniel

I fixed that last night at around 3 in the morning, so I have no idea
why you were still seeing that at 1 PM today, unless you were viewing a
cached copy.

&gt;<i> It would also probably be nice (for end users) to get RPMs,
</I>&gt;<i> DEBs, and a Win32 package for Gtk# also.  (Do we still have
</I>&gt;<i> people actively maintaining these packages?)
</I>
Of course it would be nice.  Patience would be nice too.  ;-)  The
package providers for Gtk# are all volunteer, so give them a chance. I
am working on a RH8 RPM, but it won't happen tonight, because I need
some sleep after last night's marathon. I talked to alp and the debs
will no doubt be available soon if they aren't already. I don't know if
Daniel or Johannes are planning to provide win32 bins again, but I hope
someone will.

&gt;<i> Also, a link to the source code tarball should also probably
</I>&gt;<i> be put on the homepage
</I>
The link you mentioned above (labeled &quot;0.8&quot;) on the source tarballs line
is already a link to the source tarball.

&gt;<i> This is a good starting place for new end developers.  (The website
</I>&gt;<i> should probably mention that this is still a work in progress.  But
</I>&gt;<i> is still useful.)
</I>
A documentation page for the website would be good to have.  Something
that explains how to get monodoc setup to view the new docs, perhaps an
online snapshot of the docs in html format, and of course links to the
tutorials would belong in there too.  If anyone is willing to provide
some websmanship, I will happily add it to the website.  If it's left up
to me, it probably won't happen very soon, unfortunately.
