I would love to give this a go.  There are only a couple of conditions:

1.  I'd love to use asp.net w/ mysql or postgresql, but somebody else
would have to host it.

2.  I can't start for probably another 2 weeks (once my current contract
is up).

If that sounds good, and you don't find anybody else interested within
the next little while I'd be more than happy to take the task.  Just
send me a feature/wish list for the site, and I'll do the rest.
