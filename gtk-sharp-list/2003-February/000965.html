I helped install this on a friend's computer (who is running Mandrake
9.0), so I can help you.  (Although I am doing this from memory.)


&gt;<i> When I try and make the gtk# source, I get the following assemblies not

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>       * gnome-sharp.dll: yes

</I>&gt;<i>       * gnomedb-sharp.dll: no
</I>
OK, first this is OK.  Well, OK as long as you don't want to use
Glade#, GDA#, or GnomeDB#.  (Ummm... I guess, using the new naming
convention, I mean... &quot;OK as long as you don't want to use Glade.NET,
GDA.NET, or GnomeDB.NET.&quot;)

The Gtk# source package contains alot of different stuff besides just
the GTK+ .NET bindings.  It also contains bindings for GNOME, Glade.
GDA, GnomeDB, GStreamer, GnomePrint, libart, ATK, GConf, GDK, and
more.

As you can see, it contains alot.

So... when you are building the package from source, you don't 
necessarily have to create everything.

In your case, that message is telling you that the GNOME bindings
will be created.  However, the Glade, GDA, and GnomeDB bindings
will not.

If you want these bindings though, then get the development packages
for each of these.  (And then run &quot;./configure&quot; again.)


&gt;<i> and making gives me:
</I>&gt;<i> Compilation failed: 1 error(s), 0 warnings
</I>&gt;<i> make[2]: *** [gconf-sharp-peditors.dll] Error 1
</I>&gt;<i> make[2]: Leaving directory
</I>&gt;<i> `/home/socrates/Documents/mono/gtk-sharp-0.7/gconf/GConf.PropertyEditors'
</I>&gt;<i> make[1]: *** [linux] Error 1
</I>&gt;<i> make[1]: Leaving directory
</I>&gt;<i> `/home/socrates/Documents/mono/gtk-sharp-0.7/gconf'
</I>&gt;<i> make: *** [binding] Error 1
</I>
Well, this is OK.  Well, OK if you don't want to use the GConf
bindings.  (If you want them, then get the development packages
for GConf, and then run &quot;./configure&quot; again.)

&gt;<i> So of course the compilation fails due to glade-sharp.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Installing the rpm also sees the following errors.
</I>&gt;<i> Installation failed:
</I>&gt;<i>         libglade2 is needed by gtk-sharp-0.7-1
</I>&gt;<i>         libgnomecanvas &gt;= 2.0.0 is needed by gtk-sharp-0.7-1
</I>&gt;<i>         libgnomedb is needed by gtk-sharp-0.7-1
</I>&gt;<i>         libgnomeui &gt;= 2.0.0 is needed by gtk-sharp-0.7-1
</I>
Don't try installing the RPM.  It won't work on Mandrake.

&gt;<i> Would anyone happen to know what the problem could be?  Or where I could
</I>&gt;<i> get those assemblies above... ie glade-sharp etc?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>

You may have actually created some of the RPMs.  For example, check to
see if:

    gtk-sharp-0.7/gtk/gtk-sharp.dll

exists.

One hint though, don't do a &quot;./configure&quot; when building this.
Instead run:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr

It will make things easier for you.  (Since, by default, Mono expects
all the .dll's to be in &quot;/usr/lib&quot;... and this will make it so the
Gtk# .dll's go there when you run &quot;make install&quot;.)


See ya
