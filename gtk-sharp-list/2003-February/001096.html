<PRE>Hello!

&gt;<i> I have been looking at the content of the mailing list for the past
</I>&gt;<i> few weeks and it seems there is a lot of interesting code comming in
</I>&gt;<i> and out of the forums. Also a lot of questions / solutions are comming
</I>&gt;<i> in and out however all this data is being lost in the archieves as
</I>&gt;<i> they grow. As well as any code samples that people submit these are
</I>&gt;<i> lot within the archieves.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I am interested in starting a forum where uses can post Q / A type
</I>&gt;<i> questions... sort of what they have at www.ASP.NET . Just so that we
</I>&gt;<i> can store a lot more of the code comming through as well as have a
</I>&gt;<i> nice searchable archieve of information.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> If you think this is feasible please reply ;-)
</I>
What would you use to host the Forum?

I am personally interested in seeing open source controls that can be
used to create something like the Microsoft ASP.NET Forum (and of
course, host it on Mono/Postgress or Mono/MySQL).

Miguel.
