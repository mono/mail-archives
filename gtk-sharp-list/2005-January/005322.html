Some things to keep in mind:

- Do your pixbufs have an alpha channel?  Due to the current
implementation in the X server of the RENDER extension, they may not go
through accelerated paths.

- If you'll be drawings many little pixbufs, it may be faster to
composite them onto a larger pixbuf without an alpha channel, and send
that to your window with DrawPixbuf().  Download the gtk-sharp sources
and see gtk-sharp/sample/GtkDemo/DemoPixbuf.cs, which makes a nice
animation.

- You may want to turn off double-buffering for your widget and handle
exposures yourself.  EOG has a good example of a non-double-buffered
image widget that is quite fast.

- Can you pre-generate server-side pixmaps out of your pixbufs and keep
them around?  That way they are likely to live in video memory, and
blitting will be very fast.

If you have a web page or something that shows what you are trying to do
in your program, we may be able to come up with more concrete
suggestions.
