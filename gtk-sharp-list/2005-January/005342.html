I haven't heard of anyone trying this.

The problem you'd run into is that the dlls hardcode the name of the
library they depend on, and the gtk library has different names
depending on which backend you're using.

However, this already causes problems if you want one version of gtk# to
be able to work on both Linux and Windows, since they have different
library names (libgtk-win32-2.0-0.dll vs libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0). To work
around that, we use gtk-sharp.dll.config (and other .dll.config files in
the sources) to map the Windows library names to the Linux library
names. So theoretically, all you have to do is change the mappings there
(to refer to libgtk-fb instead of libgtk-x11) and reinstall the
libraries with the new .dll.config files, and it should start using the
framebuffer version instead of the x11 version.

As I said, I don't think anyone has tried this before, so let us know
how it works...
