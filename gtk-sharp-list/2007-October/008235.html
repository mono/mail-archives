<PRE>Hello to everyone on the list!

How would I go about mixing two images (one a .PNG with transparency, and
another a .JPG which will serve as the background) for use with the
Gtk.Image control?  I've worked loosely with images in Java before, creating
animations using transparent PNGs and I did it all using the the Graphics
class etc...  Is there a similar system in Mono and are there any tutorials
out there?  What shows up on the mono page using Cairo seems way too complex
or at least is not described in any palatable form what so ever.  I've been
bumping around using Pixbufs and Drawables but of course I can't get an
instance of a Drawable.  Again, almost similar to Java, but I think there's
a few steps I'm missing.

My question is rather simple, although I can't figure it from the API quite
as easily as I thought it might be.  I'm really enjoying Mono so far, so I'm
hoping I can get help on this.

Feel free to ask me any questions if you need to!
