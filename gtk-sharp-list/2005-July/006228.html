Because we can, and it is good. It allows someone to build the library
on any operating system and run it anywhere.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
We do write the information during configure, but instead of hard coding
it into the library which makes the resulting binaries not
crossplatform, we put it in a dll mapping file. This allows the binaries
to stay portable.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No it CAN'T go in the library itself

</I>&gt;<i> On windows the information *is* in the library.  Why

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Not special, just different.

&gt;<i> &gt; incompatible with ECMA and MS.NET in that point. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; also it is easier
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to manage building for many platforms the way it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; today.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why is it easier to hard-code the windows name into
</I>&gt;<i> the library instead of writing @libgtk@ and let

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
As I said above, that results in a binary that is not crossplatform.

Your approach does not actually *GAIN* anything. These libraries would
still be in the GAC, and you would not be able to do an Assembly.Load
(&quot;gtk-sharp&quot;) and have it work.

So what is your point?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So you aren't talking of a user but of a developer,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is currently that recent versions of
</I>&gt;<i> gtk-sharp cannot be used because the .config files are
</I>&gt;<i> missing in /usr/local/lib/mono/gtk-sharp2.  That's
</I>&gt;<i> all. 
</I>

No, the config files reside next to the *ACTUAL* files, as opposed to
next to the symlinks. If you look in /usr/local/lib/mono/gac/.... you
will find gtk-sharp.dll and gtk-sharp.dll.config.

If you look at the files in /usr/local/lib/mono/gtk-sharp-2.0/ you will
see SYMLINKS those real files.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If there are now other ways to load gtk-sharp, I could
</I>&gt;<i> arrange to change my software.  It's just that I don't
</I>&gt;<i> see a method which loads the most recent version of
</I>&gt;<i> the library, be it 0.6 or 1.x.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
MonoDevelop does it fine, so I am sure you can figure out how to manage.

We actually chose a proactive method of identifying all possible
assemblies in the GAC from pc files, and handling it like that. Your
approach may be different, but I assure you, it is possible.
