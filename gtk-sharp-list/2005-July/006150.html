&gt;<i> I am working on my first application written in Gnome/GTK# and mono
</I>&gt;<i> 1.1.8 / Monodevelop; and I have run into an issue (if this is a NewB
</I>&gt;<i> issue, I apologize in advance).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This application has a couple of methods that are run via threads
</I>&gt;<i> (basically for filecopying, as my app. is a utility for managing MP3
</I>&gt;<i> files on my MP3 player), and I have tried to use the examples I have
</I>&gt;<i> seen online. Everything seems to work OK, but after I run one of these
</I>&gt;<i> threaded methods the first time I see one of the following issues:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. If I display a FileSelection widget it comes up, but the text inside
</I>&gt;<i> the widget (the list of files basically) is not visible, even though it
</I>&gt;<i> appears to be there (as I have some debug code that fires off  a line to
</I>&gt;<i> the console whenever a file is selected, so I think something is there
</I>&gt;<i> even if it is not displaying)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. The main window of my application also uses a Treeview control. In a
</I>&gt;<i> manner similar to #1 above, after running one of my threaded methods
</I>&gt;<i> once, if I run a method to populate the treeview, neither the column
</I>&gt;<i> headings or the test for the items in the Treeview appear (although
</I>&gt;<i> again I have debug code writing to the console that shows there are
</I>&gt;<i> items in the Treeview; it's just the text that is not appearing properly).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure where to go with this from a debugging point of view. I
</I>&gt;<i> have put some sample code below, as maybe the issue is there, but I
</I>&gt;<i> don't know, and of course I did not want to post everything. Is there
</I>&gt;<i> some other refresh I need to call?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any suggestions on what to try would be most appreciated!! Thanks in
</I>&gt;<i> advance!
</I>Hi John,

I'm interested on such application. Could you provide full sources so I
can help you (or maybe someone else).

Cheers,
