This is the worst solution you could ever come up with to this problem.


I have an idea. How about ubuntu ships what is the latest release at
that time and we go from that. If people just stick to the stuff in
ubuntu's repo, then they are fine, and if people start using the latest
gtk#, then obviously they are going to need to use the most recent
version of its various consuming applications. Such is the suck of
riding along the newer development lines.

I dont really see any of this as a 'big' deal, Ubuntu will ship another
release in 6 months.

All 3 of your hackish solutions add *permanent* issues we will have to
deal with, where as just dealing with the suck, the issues go away in 6
months.

I am not confident that we will see another MonoDevelop release until
the stable gtk# release regardless, so 0.7 is what would be current at
that time anyway.

Just as an aside, no MonoDevelop that ships a internal gtk# or a weirdly
versioned gtk# through any means will ever be supported. As in, don't
file your bugs with us, because that is not a sane way to deploy any
application, especially a development environment.
