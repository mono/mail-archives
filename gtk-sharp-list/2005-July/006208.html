I think we need some clarification. :-)

Ever since Mono 1.0 (if not earlier), Gtk# has been installed into the
GAC.  The only exception to this is under .NET, where a GAC installer
didn't appear until later.

For any assembly, if you want to load it from the GAC you need a
fully-qualified assembly name (name, version, culture, public key
token).  Otherwise, you can just place your assembly into the
appropriate directory and just Assembly.Load() the name.

Thus the question: how are you using, shipping, and installing Gtk#?
Are you using the one included with Mono?  Then it's in the GAC.

Are you copying the Gtk# assemblies into your applications directory?
Then an Assembly.Load() will work.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; However, I don't understand why gtk-sharp doesn't

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; appropriate native dll (windows or linux).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Because writing hundreds (yes, hundreds) of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; functions 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Depends on how you do it.  I think it should be

</I>&gt;<i> and then this dll takes over.
</I>
I know of no way to do that.  The DllImport attribute doesn't allow you
to specify which platform the library corresponds to, so you only have a
few options:

  - Use the same library name on all platforms (not always possible).
  - Use Mono's &lt;dllmap/&gt; functionality (preferred).
  - Conditional compilation (means you cannot copy an assembly between 
    platforms).
  - Duplicate DllImports (one/platform) and a runtime check to select
    which set of imports to use. (ugly!  but useful if the actual
    method imports vary between libraries.  useful for abstraction
    layers.)

You can't &quot;check the platform, load the real dll once and then this dll
takes over&quot; as it wouldn't work.  .NET will LoadLibrary() the specified
library and GetProcAddress() the requested symbol.  If the library
doesn't have the symbol, too bad -- EntryPointNotFoundException.
Similarly, Mono will dlopen() the specified library and dlsym() the
symbol, with no way for one library to masquerade as another.

There's no portable way to intercept and modify this process.

&gt;<i> &gt; Instead, mono supports .config files for .dll
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; assemblies (.NET doesn't).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I understand it, a linux user must place a dll/map
</I>&gt;<i> pair into his library directory, while the windows
</I>&gt;<i> user can simply copy the gtk-sharp dll's, right?
</I>
The user shouldn't need to worry about assemblies, much less the .config
files.  Those are a development and deployment issues, handled by the
developer and packager.

All the user needs to do is copy the application directory (and
everything inside it).  Period.
