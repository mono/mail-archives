If you can't handle the GAC, then you can't handle multiple versions
in .NET

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
If you follow the symlink to load the actual real file, it is possible,
or if you know how to write code, and read from the GAC itself, that
will work too.

&gt;<i> As it appears this is not possible on Linux, because
</I>&gt;<i> you &quot;forgot&quot; to install the .config files.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Not forgot, they are in the GAC, next to the dll files, not in the
lib/gtk-sharp dir next to the symlinks. The symlinks exist as
compilation helpers, because you can't load an assembly directly from
the GAC during compilation (csc wont do it either).

It is also possible that you have poorly installed this software.
Considering your obvious windows only bias, it wouldn't surprise me if
that was the case.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, these .config files are not ECMA standard and
</I>&gt;<i> it is unlikely that the other ECMA 335 VM's (DotGNU or

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Nope, they arent, which is EXACTLY why we use them. This is what allows
gtk# to work on ms.net and mono with the same binary.

And lets be honest, if DotGNU doesn't support it, how does that matter?
No one uses it.

&gt;<i> Until then I have simply marked Linux as not
</I>&gt;<i> supported.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Fine to me, considering I have no clue what your application actually
does, and only posted to this thread because you seemed particularly in
need of a clue.

I assume as well then you have marked OSX as not supported as well.

It sounds like you really are leveraging the crossplatform abilities
of .NET, which really is a good thing.
