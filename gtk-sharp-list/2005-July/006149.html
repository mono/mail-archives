<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>I am working on my first application written in Gnome/GTK# and mono
1.1.8 / Monodevelop; and I have run into an issue (if this is a NewB
issue, I apologize in advance).

This application has a couple of methods that are run via threads
(basically for filecopying, as my app. is a utility for managing MP3
files on my MP3 player), and I have tried to use the examples I have
seen online. Everything seems to work OK, but after I run one of these
threaded methods the first time I see one of the following issues:

1. If I display a FileSelection widget it comes up, but the text inside
the widget (the list of files basically) is not visible, even though it
appears to be there (as I have some debug code that fires off  a line to
the console whenever a file is selected, so I think something is there
even if it is not displaying)

2. The main window of my application also uses a Treeview control. In a
manner similar to #1 above, after running one of my threaded methods
once, if I run a method to populate the treeview, neither the column
headings or the test for the items in the Treeview appear (although
again I have debug code writing to the console that shows there are
items in the Treeview; it's just the text that is not appearing properly).

I am not sure where to go with this from a debugging point of view. I
have put some sample code below, as maybe the issue is there, but I
don't know, and of course I did not want to post everything. Is there
some other refresh I need to call?

Any suggestions on what to try would be most appreciated!! Thanks in
advance!

Here's some code

//copy single file to player
   
    void CopyFileToPlayer (object sender, EventArgs a)
    {
        clearLabel(); // resets status labels on window
        lblStatus.Text = &quot;File Copying in Progress...&quot;;
        buttonCopySingle.Sensitive = false;
        Thread oThread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(runSingleCopyThread));
        oThread.Start();
        notify = new ThreadNotify (new ReadyEvent (ready));
        while (!oThread.IsAlive);
    }

the method above calls:

//copy single file from playlist to player
private void runSingleCopyThread()
{
        fc = new FileCommands(); //this is an assembly  use for copying
the MP3 files
        lblStatus.Text = &quot;File Copying in Progress...&quot;;
        fc.currentTrackFile = currentTrack;
        fc.mp3PlayerPath = txtPlayerPath.Text +
System.IO.Path.DirectorySeparatorChar.ToString();
        fc.copyFile();
        if(fc.oppStatus != &quot;Copying Files...&quot;)
        {
            lblStatus.Text = fc.oppStatus;
        }
        notify.WakeupMain ();
    }

The notification method is:

//called when file copying threads are done
void ready ()
{
     buttonCopy.Sensitive = true;
     buttonCopySingle.Sensitive = true;
     lblStatus.Text = fc.oppStatus + &quot;: &quot; + fc.fileCopyCount  + &quot;
file(s) Copied&quot;;
     this.ShowAll();
 }
</PRE>
