<PRE>Hi everyone,

I'm trying to get a TextView window to go through each line in its 
TextBuffer and select that line at a certain pace, using some sort of timer. 
The selection and all that works fine, so long as I manually step through 
each line. However, if I use a timer or a thread in order to do it 
automatically, the window will basically freeze until it gets to the last 
line in the TextBuffer, at which point it stops, and then refreshes the 
window again. I know that it executes the code correctly, but the window 
won't update anything until it's done with the timer. The same thing happens 
whether I'm using a timer or thread. I'll email some source code if you need 
it; I haven't in this message because my code is rather long and complex, 
and would take some time to get down to the barebones.

Thank you very much.

-Mike Storm
