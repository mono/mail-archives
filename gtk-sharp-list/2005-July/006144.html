<PRE>Hey,

Currently I'm working in Publisher Policy support, which could help to
solve this, since it could redirect the reference from gtk 1.x to 2.x.

I don't know if this could help the way you want. Anyway, I will be
sending the patches today night.

Carlos.

&gt;<i> Hey guys,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've been working with tseng, our fearless Ubuntu packager on packaging
</I>&gt;<i> Gtk# 2 apps. It looks like we are pretty clearly not going to be api
</I>&gt;<i> frozen soon enough to make it a good idea to ship Gtk# 2 in the GAC.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, I suggested that we include a pre-release gtk# in the private bin
</I>&gt;<i> path for gtk# 2 apps (muine and monodevelop). However, when I was
</I>&gt;<i> thinking about this, I realized we had a little problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As documented on <A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/3y73k,">http://tinyurl.com/3y73k,</A> the runtime loads assemblies
</I>&gt;<i> from the GAC before it does private path probing. This is done for
</I>&gt;<i> performance reasons (it is more likely that code gets shared between
</I>&gt;<i> processes. Also, for non-gac'd strong named assemblies, the entire file
</I>&gt;<i> has to be read from disk to check the signature. With that gac this is
</I>&gt;<i> done at install time).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right now, we ship pre-release gtk# assemblies with versions 2.4.0.0.
</I>&gt;<i> So, if somebody installs an ubuntu with Gtk# 2 (a pre release) in md's
</I>&gt;<i> private bin path, and later (after we release gtk# 2), installs the
</I>&gt;<i> final .dll files into the gac, when monodevelop is launched, the
</I>&gt;<i> final .dll files will be found by the runtime. However, these may have
</I>&gt;<i> api differences, and thus break MD.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can think of three ways to make this situation not break:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Use different version numbers for pre-releases
</I>&gt;<i> --------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In this solution, the .dll version of Gtk# would change on each
</I>&gt;<i> pre-release. Thus, the MD that is installed with ubuntu would bind to
</I>&gt;<i> 2.3.4.0 (eg). When the user installs 2.4.0.0 in the gac, the older
</I>&gt;<i> assembly will still be loaded by the runtime.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the final release, and all subsequent stable releases, the .dll
</I>&gt;<i> would have the version 2.4.0.0
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Pros:
</I>&gt;<i>       * Easy for packagers (they just move the files into the bin path)
</I>&gt;<i>       * Makes packages of applications that depend on unstable gtk# less
</I>&gt;<i>         likely to break (because the rpm will code a dependency to the
</I>&gt;<i>         exact gtk# version and refuse to upgrade to newer pre-releases)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cons:
</I>&gt;<i>       * Small pain for people working from svn: multiple copies of gtk#
</I>&gt;<i>         will get installed in their GAC.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Use a different version number for each release
</I>&gt;<i> ---------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Same as above, except that we continue the policy through stable
</I>&gt;<i> releases. We will have assemblies 2.4.1.0, 2.4.2.0
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We would use publisher policies to make sure that no matter what stable
</I>&gt;<i> version of gtk# a program was built on, it would run on all others.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Pros:
</I>&gt;<i>       * In theory, would allow parallel installation of stable gtk#
</I>&gt;<i>         versions. Also, makes it easy for an application to demand a
</I>&gt;<i>         specific version of gtk#.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cons:
</I>&gt;<i>       * Makes rpm dependencies a bit of a pain (the automated script
</I>&gt;<i>         that searches for dependencies would probably have trouble with
</I>&gt;<i>         this).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Force people shipping unstable versions of gtk# to rename the
</I>&gt;<i> assembly
</I>&gt;<i> -----------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Probably the easiest way for a packager to do this would be to sign gtk#
</I>&gt;<i> with a different key. In the eyes of the runtime, this would mean that
</I>&gt;<i> the gtk#'s we ship would not match the library the application was
</I>&gt;<i> looking for. Thus it would use the one on the private path.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Pros:
</I>&gt;<i>       * Easy for us (no effort involved)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cons:
</I>&gt;<i>       * Harder for packagers (they have to build custom gtk# versions)
</I>&gt;<i>       * Annoying for plugins (any MD plugin would have to compile with
</I>&gt;<i>         the custom gtk#)
</I>&gt;<i>       * Doesn't allow us to take advantage of the configuration options
</I>&gt;<i>         offered by the runtime
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -- Ben
