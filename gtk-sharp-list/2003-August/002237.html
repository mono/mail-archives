<PRE>Hello all,

I am trying to get the SizeRequest from a GTK widget via gtk-sharp.  It
doesn't seem to work right now:  WidthRequest and HeightRequest seem to
return -1.  I'd like to try to fix this, but I'll need a little
guidance, as I don't know much about language bindings.

Poking through the source files I am trying to figure out where a
property like WidthRequest is defined, but it only seems to be mentioned
in api/gtk-api.xml and there is no implementation there.  Can someone
give me a brief overview as to how gtk-sharp actually works?  

It seems to me like there is some sort of automatic binding
specification in the XML in the the api/ folder and then there are more
C#ish objects in .custom files in gtk/, gdk/, etc.  Is this right?  If
so, does that mean eventually the goal is to have all of the
functionality of GTK contained in .custom files?  Is there anything I
can read to get a better understanding of how this works?

Thanks for your patience, I'm not an expert, but I want to help.

Erik Pukinskis
