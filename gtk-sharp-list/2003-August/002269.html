This is a known issue and an inherent problem with late-binding to
shared objects. Because most users of Mono are developers (with all the
required development packages) right now, it hasn't been a priority to
fix. The Debian packages address the problem by depending on the
development packages of required libraries, which, as you point out, is
rather a lot of overhead for just one symlink as far as the user is
concerned.

We looked into finding an intelligent solution to the problem a few
months back, but nothing struck us as immediately obvious, so the issue
still stands.

Please open a bug for this issue and we'll see if anyone can offer a
better solution.
