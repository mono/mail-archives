<PRE>Hi!

I have a Gtk object structure in a library and some of the structure 
members do not
have an access (get/set) functions:

       struct Something {
                GObject parent;

                int something;
       }

I wonder if there is a way to provide access to such members from  C# 
wrapper.
The obvious solution is to patch source code and write trivial get/set 
functions in C
but this would mean that user would have to install the &quot;modified&quot; 
version of
the library which might not be possible by some reasons. I have looked 
at the
GTK# wrappers but I could not find any examples there.

Any ideas?

Aleksey
