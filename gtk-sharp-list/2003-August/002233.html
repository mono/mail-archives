<PRE>I had some more time to play with this and I found that the problem is in
the current gtk-sharp CVS trunk. The combination mono/mcs from CVS
trunk + gtk-sharp 0.10 works just fine. But if I try any mono/mcs with 
current
gtk-sharp CVS trunk, the application throws a System.NullReferenceException
at random place. Sometimes I also see GTK assertions like this one:
   
(&lt;unknown&gt;:15627): Gtk-CRITICAL **: file gtktreeviewcolumn.c: line 2344
(gtk_tree_view_column_cell_get_size): assertion `GTK_IS_TREE_VIEW_COLUMN
(tree_column)' failed

After looking at the problem in the debugger I have a feeling that
there is a GObject reference count problem somewhere. But I was not
able to spot the exact place.

I have found a solution for now (use gtk-sharp 0.10). But if someone
would need help with testing or reproducing the problem I would be
glad to help.

With best regards,
Aleksey
