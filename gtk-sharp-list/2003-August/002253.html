Hello there.
Two things concern this email.

The first one regarding the patch I submitted to duncan to add a new
.custom file for the Notebook widget that added a property to return the
widget that the page has as a child. When I submitted I thought this
widget that was being returned was a NotebookPage widget and not the
Child widget itself. Now that I understand what it really returns I
think the name of the propery could be changed from CurrentPageWidget to
something more clear like CurrentPageChild. What do you guys think? I
will also have to submit a patch for the monodoc documentation since I
said it returned the widget for the page there... not the actual
contents of the page.

The next thing is really a question. I had a Child widget in one hand...
and I had a notebook widget on the other hand... and I really scratched
my head many times wondering why using a child widget and a notebook I
could get the Label for a page using GetTabLabel method of the Notebook
widget but I couldn't do the same with the Child widget. After many
swearing and things I found that I could call a method of NotebookPage
directly in order to achieve this using this code:

int pageNum = NotebookPage.Num(Notebook, Child);

My question is... why is this in NotebookPage and not as another method
for Notebook like the one that's used to get the Page's label? 
And another side question to the same matter is, why I can call that
method without having an object instance of NotebookPage?

Thanks for reading.

Regards,
