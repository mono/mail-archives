A few things.  First, your attachment shows up as:

Content-Type: application/ms-tnef; name=&quot;winmail.dat&quot;
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;winmail.dat&quot;

Please attach patches as plain text.

Second, TextTag doesn't have a Weight property any more. It was removed
in 2.2 and we are now tracking the 2.2 API.

Third, (guessing on this, since I couldn't read the patch) the subject
looks like you patched gtk-api.xml directly.  We don't hand edit those
files, since they are generated by the parser from source.  Any hand
edits would be lost the next time somebody runs the parser and checks in
the resulting file.  We alter those files via metadata rules which are
stored in the sources dir in cvs.

FWIW, I think what you are looking for is the TextTag.FontDesc, which
allows you to set a weight.
