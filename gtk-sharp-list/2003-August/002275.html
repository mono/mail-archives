I've been swamped a bit lately and haven't had much chance to work on
Gtk#.  Also, there have been some reports of instability related to the
ref counting patch that I want to try to address before releasing.  

There's a patch queued up (sorry for the delay, Aleksey) related to
signal handling and ref ownership, but that may not solve all the
pending issues.

In other words, you should probably build cvs for now.
