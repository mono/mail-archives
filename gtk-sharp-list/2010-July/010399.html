Gdk.Window (not to be confused with Gtk.Window) is an underlying GDK
drawable primitive, essentially a sort of a low-level surface. Widgets
need one in order to receive events - but since they consume
resources, some widgets that don't need events, such as Label or
certain containers, do not have one, and instead simply paint on their
parent's Gdk.Window. The GdkWindow property of a widget accesses the
Gdk.Window it uses..

DrawingArea is basically a convenience subclass of Widget that can
(depending on flags) set up a Gdk.Window for itself properly, so you
probably already have one.

The Gdk.Window.Scroll method translates its contents directly on the X
server (i.e. very efficiently) in the amount and direction you
specify, then invalidates the remaining region, so you then get an
Expose event for only the invalidated area.

You might also like to investigate Clutter for your project - a
3d-accelerated scene graph that integrates somewhat with GTK.
