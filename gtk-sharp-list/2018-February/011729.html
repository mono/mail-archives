<PRE>OK. I eventually worked through this, and was able to successfully build a working 64-bit Gtk# on Windows. If anyone desperately needs the binaries, or needs advice on building their own, they're welcome to contact me.

=====
I would like to run Gtk# on Windows in a 64-bit application, but I haven't been able to locate a pre-built set of DLLs that would allow me to do that.  It appears that Gtk+ 2 (native only) is available for Windows (and is used in GIMP, for example), and the managed Gtk# layers should run on &quot;any CPU&quot;, with the gap being the &quot;glue&quot; DLLs between these layers. Are suitable 64-bit DLLs available somewhere? If not, should I be able to compile them myself without undue difficulty, or are there some obscure technical problems that make this infeasible?
