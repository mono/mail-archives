My knee jerk reaction is that you probably don't really want to do
this.  ;-)  

When a column header shows a sorted indicator, users are going to expect
all rows to be sorted by that indicator.  What you are proposing is a
behavior that is inconsistent with the standard visual feedback of the
interface, and will likely confuse your users.

&gt;<i>   Basically, i want

</I>
If you really want to do this, you would have to implement your own
custom model, which means implementing GtkTreeModel on a GObject
subclass, and also implementing the GtkTreeSortable interface.  

Unfortunately, there is no mechanism currently in Gtk# to register
GObject interface implementations at type registration time, so the
above approach isn't possible yet with the binding.
