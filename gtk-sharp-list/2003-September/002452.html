<PRE>Hey guys

i have a widget which contains a Gtk TreeView.  New rows are added to the 
TreeView from a different thread than the GUI thread.  At random times in my 
application the GUI will freeze up and this exception occurs:

System.NullReferenceException: A null value was found where an object instance 
was required
in (unmanaged) 06 Gtk.Application:gtk_main ()
in &lt;0x00004&gt; 06 Gtk.Application:gtk_main ()
in &lt;0x00007&gt; 00 Gtk.Application:Run ()

i think the problem is more noticable when i enable sorting of the treeview... 
so that probably means that both the GUI thread and the other thread are 
accessing the underlying ListStore object at the same time.  Now what is the 
correct way in gtk# to do this in a thread-safe manner?

in my SWF gui i just use the Invoke method of a Form so the GUI thread will 
actually update the ListView, but in gtk# i don't know how to do this.  Could 
anyone tell me what the best way would be to do this in gtk#?

kind regards,
davy brion
