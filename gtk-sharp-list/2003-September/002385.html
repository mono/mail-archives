I think it's better to have all the glue code in one place, but there
have been other people suggest breaking it up into more focused glue
libs in the past.  I would probably accept a patch to split it into
libgtksharpglue and libgnomesharpglue.  I don't see a lot of point to
fragmenting it beyond that.

Gtk# will only be including gnome platform libraries.  I don't see how
fragmenting the glue really helps to include platform libraries, but I
agree that it may help clarify packaging issues.
