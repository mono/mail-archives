Actually that is a problem because if you install the gstreamer-player, 
people can't play multimedia files unless they explicitly install each 
individual multimedia plugin they need. Most people however wouldn't know 
that something is missing and that they have to install something extra.

To make it easier, they introduced an empty virtual package that requires 
all the multi-media plugins. But then one might wonder why you don't put 
them all in a big package in the first place. That's why I'm packaging it 
like that. That's what most people want anyway and it's not that size 
matters (if you're playing multimedia).
