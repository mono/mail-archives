<PRE>Hi,

Well, for the immediate future, I'd be happy with tagging 2.99.4.
There's the super annoying warning &quot;Source ID was not found when
attempting to remove it&quot; in 2.99.3 that's been fixed in master.

I don't think there's any good solution to get things forward if no one
who can actively maintain gtk-sharp steps up.

One option that comes to my mind is some kind of ack-system, so that
people would report to pull-requests if the PR works for them. If
there's a sufficient amount of acks, then maybe it could be merged even
if it hasn't been thoroughly reviewed. Obviously it's better if people
would also do a review, but speaking of myself, I can test gtk-sharp,
but I don't know enough of glib/gtk internals to be able to properly
review most of the patches.

As for the strategy question, I have only one comment: as it's difficult
to find maintainer-time for gtk-sharp, the strategy should be that of
minimal work for the maintainer.

I might even say that that aspect is the most important one. If it's
easiest for the maintainer to break the gtk-sharp API in every 3.x
release, so be it. I think it's much much better to get API breaking 3.x
releases every now and then, than being stuck at 3.0 (or 2.99.x) for ever.

I don't care much for stable GTK# API, but I very much care about using
the gtk features that's been out there for years. If someone doesn't
want to handle the GTK# API changing, they can just use the old library
version.

Having GTK# that is stuck in years old GTK version, getting no new
features, is basically a dead project. It doesn't matter if the API is
super stable if no one uses the library.

And just to make it clear, I'm not advocating such approach as a good
one. Obviously a stable API with well tested functionality should be the
target. But we have to make do with what we have.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding the strategy for newer GTK+ API and Gtk# releases:
</I>&gt;<i> My idea was, once git master reached a certain level of maturity, to
</I>&gt;<i> create a 3.0 branch, which would be API-stable and bug fixes only.
</I>&gt;<i> Git master could then be updated to bind the GTK+ 3.12 or 3.14 APIs,
</I>&gt;<i> which would then itself be branched off when it's mature.
</I>&gt;<i> So that's approach 2 described by Antonius.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know that Gtk# 2.12 and before uses something like approach 1. See for
</I>&gt;<i> example:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/mono/gtk-sharp/blob/gtk-sharp-2-12-branch/bootstrap-2.12">https://github.com/mono/gtk-sharp/blob/gtk-sharp-2-12-branch/bootstrap-2.12</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This was removed in the early days of porting to GTK+ 3, see:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/mono/gtk-sharp/commit/fe2d4c311">https://github.com/mono/gtk-sharp/commit/fe2d4c311</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know exactly what the pros and cons of that approach were, it
</I>&gt;<i> was before I was involved.
</I>&gt;<i> But I think nowadays with git it's much easier to maintain each API in
</I>&gt;<i> it's own branch, and merge what is needed from one to the other. Doing
</I>&gt;<i> this with SVN at the time would probably have been painful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think ? How far are we from being able to delare the Gtk#
</I>&gt;<i> API stable for 3.0 ?
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>     Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>     I agree with Tomi that it hurts development when PRs remain unattended.
</I>&gt;<i>     Since the current plan (release 3.0 first, higher versions after that),
</I>&gt;<i>     prevents contributions of higher version API, I think we should discuss
</I>&gt;<i>     alternative development plans concerning the release of newer Gtk#
</I>&gt;<i>     versions. I think, in addition to the current plan there are 2
</I>&gt;<i>     alternatives:
</I>&gt;<i>      1. Use conditional compilation to build different API versions. Keep
</I>&gt;<i>     all supported versions in the master branch. (The same as mono does with
</I>&gt;<i>     various .NET profiles.)
</I>&gt;<i>      2. Create a branch for each Gtk# release and have unstable API in the
</I>&gt;<i>     master branch.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Both approaches support simultaneous development of different Gtk#
</I>&gt;<i>     versions. Both are feasible (though approach 1 would need PR #129 [1] to
</I>&gt;<i>     be merged for working with bindinator's conditional code generation
</I>&gt;<i>     feature).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     What are your opinions on this? What are the pros and cons concerning
</I>&gt;<i>     the alternative approaches?
