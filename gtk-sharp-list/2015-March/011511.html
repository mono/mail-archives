<PRE>I've developed an app in Xamarin for OSX that requires sending data to a
printer. My app was originally leveraging System.Drawing for printing and
that was working fine with Mavericks. Unfortunately, Yosemite broke Mono's
System.Drawing implementation, and I was forced to find alternatives since
this was now a production issue that was preventing our customers from being
able to print receipts (not good for a POS system).

GTK# works like a charm for printing from my dev machine. However, when I
try to make an app bundle and install on another non-Mono Mac workstation,
the application doesn't send any data to the print queue. I'm at a loss as
to why it's so difficult to gather all of the required libraries to deploy
onto another machine.

Could someone please provide a list of all required libs and dll mappings in
order to get this to work?

Thanks.
