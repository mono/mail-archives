</I>&gt;<i> 2) Maintain stability by leaving the gnomeprint* dependency in

I'd go with 1) and provide gnome-print bindings in gnome-desktop-sharp
until every user (i.e. tomboy and...?) finally have ported and then
remove it from gnome-desktop-sharp too.

Also, while you're breaking API anyway please remove all other desktop
components from gnome-sharp if there are still any and move them to
gnome-desktop-sharp :)

Breaking API is not nice but in this case makes sense IMHO... and
afterwards we can guarantuee API stability until 3.0 next decade or next
century :)
