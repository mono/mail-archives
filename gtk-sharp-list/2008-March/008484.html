<PRE>PS: this is gtk-sharp 2.8.3 on windows (what's packaged with the most
recent mono)

<A HREF="http://monoport.com/7814">http://monoport.com/7814</A>

I have put in a GC.Collect(); right after the call to this function
and it triggers the access violation every time.

If I comment lines 8,9,10 and 14,15,16 I don't get the violation (or a
working tree) if I leave them in i get the violation every time. 

here's what goes in the console...

Exception while disposing a Gtk.TreeViewColumn in Gtk#
10890 [11] ERROR Sucker.Gui (null) - Unexpected error occurred:
Attempted to read or write protected memory. This is often an indication
that other memory is corrupt.
System.AccessViolationException: Attempted to read or write protected
memory. This is often an indication that other memory is corrupt.
   at GLib.Object.Dispose()
   at Gtk.Object.Dispose()
   at GLib.Object.PerformQueuedUnrefs()



I can't see a problem with this code...

Those columns are being added to tvSolution which stays in scope during
the whole form display.

What can I do? 

For the moment I've moved the declaration for those two treeviewcolumns
to the class level, which moves the problem out of this form to the
calling form... sigh.  Am i going to have to make these application
GLOBAL?

Maybe it's because I have not put anything into the tree yet?
