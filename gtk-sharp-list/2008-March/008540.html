&gt;<i> 2) Maintain stability by leaving the gnomeprint* dependency in
</I>&gt;<i> gnome-sharp.dll.  I don't think this choice will be appreciated by the
</I>&gt;<i> GNOME folks, and would put pressure on Tomboy, because it depends on
</I>&gt;<i> gnome-sharp.dll.  Any gnome build which included Tomboy would therefore
</I>&gt;<i> still require libgnomeprint* and I doubt the gnome folks will be pleased
</I>&gt;<i> with us.  This is probably a non-starter, but I mention it for
</I>&gt;<i> completeness.  This is the &quot;bury our heads in the sand&quot; solution.

Actually, am not sure that this is out of the question.

On the thread at d-d-l people seemed to suggest that distributions will
continue (or can continue) to ship this library.  We could just continue
to depend on it.

Besides, it is a runtime dependency, not a compile-time dependency, so
we could just make it a requirement in the packaging that this is
available, while we move people to another library.

In the meantime, it makes sense to continue with our migration to
independent libraries, to avoid these situations in the future.
