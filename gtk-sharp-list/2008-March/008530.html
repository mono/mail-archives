<PRE>Hi,

I have now written two small example applications for the bugs. Both 
will result in a stack overflow when executing them. Hope that helps 
fixing the problems... I also included my patchfiles again.

However, I have come to the conclusion that the better way of fixing the 
bug with the TreeModelAdapter would be modifying GAPI so that it does 
not only create a wrapper/adapter for the methods of the original 
GInterface but also for the ones that are manually added by the .custom 
files. But since I didn't ever have a look at GAPI and assume it is 
quiet complex, one of the developers that are more familiar with the 
codegenerator may do that.

But these bugs really need to be fixed; I have provided sample apps and 
bug fixes, that is all I can do for now. And when Gtk# 2.12 is released 
- and everyone wants write editable custom TreeModels - it will be too 
late...

I really don't want to make you work instead of mine but as I am not 
really familiar with the Gtk# code all I can do is to report the bugs I 
found and maybe provide a rudimentary fix for them. Sorry if the tone of 
the mail was like &quot;FIX this bug! And the sooner, the best!!!&quot;. I 
understand that you are all(?) hobby developers and work on this 
implementation for no charge. I really admire what you have done so far 
:<i>-) . So if you say you don't like some aspects of my bugfix I will try 
</I>to overwrite them and maybe even have a look at GAPI. But I am not the 
one who decides what is committed and what isn't so I need your response...

Christian Hoff
