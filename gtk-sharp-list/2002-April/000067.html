Gtk+-2.0 has not been declared stable on win32 yet.  Even if it is
stable enough to play with, it looks like we will need Gtk+ binaries
built with MSVC in order to successfully pinvoke into the dll's. I am
not aware of anyone providing such binaries.  

The only win32 binaries I know of are produced with gcc and libtool. I
have not seen a successful pinvoke with the MS runtime into a
gcc+libtool dll yet.  I was able to do some very simple win32 testing
with some MSVC built dll's at one point. I have gone farther on linux
testing of Gtk# than I was ever able to on win32. 

The plan is to eventually support Gtk# on both win32 and *nix platforms
for folks who want cross platform capability using the Gtk API and for
our win32 implementation of System.Windows.Forms.  Right now, Gtk# is a
build on win32, run on linux project, though.
