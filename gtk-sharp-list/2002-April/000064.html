That's where I am now also right now :) I've posted my &quot;first Gtk#
steps&quot; on <A HREF="http://mono.baselabs.org/gtk-sharp/">http://mono.baselabs.org/gtk-sharp/</A> just like I did with
mono/mint/mcs, hoping it will help people pick up the project.

&gt;<i> so if it's not there yet, please add a bug report against

</I>
I'll look into on Monday and submit whatever I can track down

</I>
Well, it's automated to the level that I have to start one script. I
believe, just as I did a few weeks ago regarding Mono itself, that
providing rpms with the on w32 build .dll's offers people with no access
to a w32 build machine the opportunity to test the run-time and submit
bug reports.

I think I'll start building run-time dll's as of monday, just to have
the procedure in place and to complete the current offering :) Maybe
I'll add a temporary rpm containing the current applications (hello en
button) build on w32. This way all is in place for others to test-drive
and bug-hunt on Linux.
 
&gt;<i> Thanks for your interest in doing this.
</I>
No problem, it's a personal joy and I can give something in return.

greetz,
Christophe
