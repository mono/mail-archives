Others have reported the same failure.  I personally am still building on
win32 and running on linux. My linux build efforts have been focused on
&quot;make linux&quot;, which currently fails in the glib directory, long before
attempting to build HelloWorld. I believe someone was going to log this 
in bugzilla, so if it's not there yet, please add a bug report against
mcs or the class libs.

If it's a lot of manual work, I wouldn't go to the trouble yet.  Until 
people can build on linux against the prebuilt dll's, there's not a lot
of value to binaries. If it's an automated script, I would suggest that
you &quot;make windows&quot; on win32 and distribute */*.dll and sample/*.exe.

Thanks for your interest in doing this.

Mike
