<PRE>Announcing the first public release of Gtk#, codenamed Buttonhook.

Binaries and source available for immediate download at
<A HREF="http://gtk-sharp.sf.net.">http://gtk-sharp.sf.net.</A>

About Gtk#:

Gtk# is a C# language binding for the Gtk+ toolkit.  It exposes the
Gtk+-2.0 API via a nice set of C# classes for your GUI programming
pleasure.

At least that's what it will eventually do.  Right now, all we're sure
it does is run a Hello World app and a simple Button pressing demo app. 
We invite you to kick the tires and send us lots of bug reports, if you
are the type that likes to adopt technologies long before they do much
of anything useful.

Dependencies:

You will need a gtk-x11-2.0 installation on linux in order to run the
samples and utilize the Gtk# dll's.  To hack on Gtk#, you still need a
win32 machine with the .Net Framework installed, as the binding cannot
be compiled on linux yet. Hopefully, complete self-hosting on linux is
just around the corner.  You will also need a mono installation newer
than release 0.10. At time of release, that means CVS or a nightly
build.

Acknowledgements:

Thanks to Ximian and the Mono project for CVS hosting.  Thanks to
Sourceforge for project hosting.  Thanks to Bob Smith for early
conceptual work on the signal handling system. Thanks to all of the mono
team for a quickly maturing framework to build on. Thanks to my wife for
not complaining about me hacking in my lazyboy when I could instead have
been showering affection down on her.

Contact:

Discussion of Gtk# occurs at <A HREF="mailto:gtk-sharp-list@ximian.com.">gtk-sharp-list@ximian.com.</A>  Questions and
bug reports should be directed there.
