<PRE>I just realized that if you simply comment out the &quot;DeleteEvent&quot; line, you
can compile HelloWorld.cs under Linux.

Likewise, ButtonApp.cs also compiles with mcs and Linux if you comment out
the lines:

win.DeleteEvent += new EventHandler (Window_Delete);
btn.Clicked += new EventHandler (btn_click);


Notice that by commenting these out you make the button not do anything.
Therefore, you won't be able to write useful programs yet.  However, we
can at least start playing around with Gtk#.  Maybe try to implement
WinForms?


Cheers,
Daniel.

I have not tried the compilation you describe above. I am currently
trying to keep bugzilla stocked with the current bug which stops &quot;make
linux&quot; for Gtk#, and linux execution of win32 built sample programs. The
bug you are describing will eventually hit my radar screen using this
approach, I guess, once the binding compiles and the linux build moves
on to the samples.

If you want to report this as a bug, the best approach is to try to
build it on win32 using mcs with the MS corlib/runtime as well as on
linux, to help isolate whether it is a compiler problem, or a problem in
the corlib/runtime.  Then use bugzilla to report it against the
appropriate module.

Mike
