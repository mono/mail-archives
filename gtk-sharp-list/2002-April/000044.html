Gtk.Window is defined in gtk-sharp.dll, which pinvokes to
libgtk-x11-2.0.so on linux.  So you need to -r gtk-sharp.dll.  The
binding dlls don't build yet on linux, so you'll need to build gtk-sharp
from cvs on win32 in order to try anything on linux yet.

If you are asking if there will be a System.Windows.Forms implementation
based on Gtk#, the answer is yes, eventually.  Windows apps that don't
mess around with window handles and pinvoke to the win32api will
hopefully be portable between win32 and mono/linux.  

Gtk# is unreleased, pre-alpha vaporware.  As I said above, the binding
does not compile on linux.  A win32 compiled Gtk# hello world app will
almost run on linux.  The window shows, but the app segfaults when the
window is closed after delete event processing and gtk main loop exit.
