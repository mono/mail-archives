I do have the dlls compiled on windows.  The gtk-hello-world.exe program
now runs on linux.  However when I recompile the source code (the exact
same source code that gtk-hello-world.exe was compiled from), I get an
error that says Gtk.Window does not contain a &quot;DeleteEvent&quot; member.=20
This is clearly not true, since I can see the DeleteEvent in the source
code for gtksharp.  It's right there defined as an event.  Perhaps mcs
cannot compile this stuff yet.  I'll compile with csc, I suppose.

&gt;<i> If you are asking if there will be a System.Windows.Forms implementation

</I>&gt;<i> window is closed after delete event processing and gtk main loop exit.
</I>Pretty good for vaporware.  Looking good so far.
