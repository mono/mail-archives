Speaking of which, I've been trying to implement the necessary icalls to
actually get it to build.  At least, stubbing them out... I've run into
a couple of mcs bugs, they're #23643 and (more importantly) #23644.

The System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal class is really poorly
documented as far as implementation goes in the MSDN docs, and not in
the ECMA Technical Report at all, so I'm a little unclear as to how
exactly to implement the memory management... but anyway, they really
just need to be stubbed out so the compilation can continue and then be
filled in later when it doesn't build... Miguel, would it be okay to
check in just stubbed out internal calls into the runtime, or should we
wait until we have something we think might work reasonably?
