The code generator writes code to a gdk/generated directory, which
provides the gdk binding.  The directory is there is cvs to provide a
make rule and to provide a place to put gdk custom (non-generated)
binding files if and when it ever comes to that.

The codegen directory is actually dormant now, if you look at the
toplevel makefile.  The code generator lives in the generator directory
and is composed of C# source and a gtkapi.xml API specification.  Ignore
the scheme s-expr's.  I guess I should put a big IGNORE_THIS_DIR file
into cvs or something, to avoid questions until I decide to ship the
whole dir off to the cvs attic.

If you wanna see the binding, you have to run the code generator.  It
runs on both win32 and linux.  Just do a make windows or make linux,
depending on your platform.  make linux on linux will fail immediately
following the code generation step in the glib dir, but at least you can
snoop around in the */generated nodes for pango, atk, gdk, and gtk.
