<PRE>&gt;<i> Thanks to Ximian and the Mono project for CVS hosting.  Thanks to
</I>&gt;<i> Sourceforge for project hosting.  Thanks to Bob Smith for early
</I>&gt;<i> conceptual work on the signal handling system. Thanks to all of the mono
</I>&gt;<i> team for a quickly maturing framework to build on. Thanks to my wife for
</I>&gt;<i> not complaining about me hacking in my lazyboy when I could instead have
</I>&gt;<i> been showering affection down on her.
</I>
I would like to thank everyone who has contributed so far, because
developing for Mono is not exactly simple due to all the evolving
pieces, and all the rapidly changing code.

On the other hand, Mono feels just like the early Gnome days: Breaking
binary compatibility around the clock ;-)

Thanks to everyone who has had all that patience and submitted bug
reports to fix Mono, I know it can be frustrating at times.

Miguel.
