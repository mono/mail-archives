<PRE>Hello,

I was hoping that I could look at the Gtk# code.
I downloaded the CVS tree and I couldn't make sense of it.  Most
directories were nearly empty.  One directory contains what seems to be
LISP code.

This seems odd.  I'd expect that the gdk directory have some sort of gdk
bindings for C#.  Instead, its empty.  Likewise for other directories.

Could someone help me make sense of this.  I'm sure that the key is in
that directory with all the LISP code, but I don't know LISP.

I would really like to figure out how your code works.  Could someone help
me please?

Thanks.
Daniel.
