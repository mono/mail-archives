No API clarity?  It's one of the best things you can do with C# to
improve API clarity.  When declaring what classes/interfaces a new class
inherits from, it can become an annoying job to figure out if one is
inheriting from an interface or class.  Of course, if a user would never
need to implement one, then why are they public?

Well, not 'only' because of it, but that's the issue I decided to argue
about today.  Actually, it looks like most of my gripes have been fixed
already, so erm... never mind.

The inconsistency is the annoying bit.  Why does ITreeNode have the
preceding I, for instance?
