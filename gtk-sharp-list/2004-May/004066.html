libxml2 should be buildable on win32.  I know DV has commented
frequently about his win32 users.  

We can't rely on gapi-fixup because it's used at make time for each
assembly.  You could redo gapi_formal_xml using System.Xml, but that
won't remove the libxml dependency with GAPI::Metadata still in the
picture. At this point, I think we could probably nuke all of that
though and kill those perl libxml binding deps at the same time.  I
doubt anybody is using the old metadata engine at this point, and if
they are, now is the time to force them to upgrade to gapi-fixup, before
1.0 hits the streets.

If you are willing to work on this, I will buy you beers next time we
meet.  I'd love to have an integrated win32 build, and we arguably need
it for beta2 since we want to install strongnamed/GACd assemblies on
win32 and need the AssemblyInfo.cs.in configure expansion step, etc...
