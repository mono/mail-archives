This kind of stuff scares the crap out of me for API stability
guarantees.  This is not the first example of a property type having
changed between 2.2 and 2.4.  For some reason, it doesn't seem like the
gtk+ folks consider this to be an API change, since no method signature
changed and int/uint are &quot;compatible&quot; with enums in C in the realm of
string+void_value APIs.  

I'm afraid we are going to have to add a hack to deal with these kinds
of incompatibilities going forward, but I don't have any good ideas on
how to deal with it yet.
