Some valid points.

As far as wasted effort goes, I'd be willing to do all the work
(documentation, code, fixing projects like Muine/MonoDevelop, etc.)
myself.  I'd just be sitting on around playing the guitar, anyway.  At
least this is a bit more productive.  ;-)

Microsoft's entire .NET API is much nicer than the OSS alternatives. 
The sole reason for this is that they took care to make the API appear
as though everything had been written in managed code from the
beginning.  It's very professionally done.  Gtk# is nice, but a bit
rough around the edges.  Personally, I would love to see development
with Mono be every bit as pleasant an experience as it is with Microsoft
software.

I can understand the benefits of being similar to the C API, but if a
developer wanted to use the C API, they'd be writing C code.  (On a
related note, I plan on working on documentation for Gtk# over the
summer with the Gtk+ docs as a guide.  This should seriously ease
beginner's pain.)

I still believe it should be done now, before the API freeze and before
applications targeting Mono reach an officially stable state.  If it's
not done now, it'll just be that much longer before it CAN be done
again, after all.
