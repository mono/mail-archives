<PRE>As far as my opinion counts, and I dont know exactly how far that is, I
think this is a bad idea.

My understand of implementing a GInterface is that its very different
than implementing a C# interface.

Looking at vlad's recent patch to do so basically proves my point.

Breaking this much code for no appreciable gain to me seems to make
little to no sense. I don't think a user type should ever implement a
GInterface directly, as it just wont work the way you want it to (yet,
maybe later). Therefore giving it the preceding I gives you no API
clarity, and just breaks almost every single Gtk# app in existence. For
what point?

If Gtk# is rough around the edges only because we dont have an I in
front of interfaces that you should *never* implement directly then I
would say our job here is done, and we can pack up and go home early.

Basically, you should treat these interfaces as abstract classes, not
interfaces.

And believe it or not, existing gtk+ developers moving to gtk# are one
of the prime targets of gtk#.
