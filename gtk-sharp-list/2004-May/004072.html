</I>Libxml works fine, I just had some weird cygwin pkg-config problem with 
it, then I thought why does it need it anyways and it seemed like it was 
only used for the
perl stuff that I thought was going to be removed. I guess I should look 
at what gapi_format_xml does, but I think it is equivalent to 
monodoc/browser/normalize.cs., and should be easily replaceable.

&gt;<i>We can't rely on gapi-fixup because it's used at make time for each
</I>&gt;<i>assembly.  You could redo gapi_formal_xml using System.Xml, but that
</I>&gt;<i>won't remove the libxml dependency with GAPI::Metadata still in the
</I>&gt;<i>picture. At this point, I think we could probably nuke all of that
</I>&gt;<i>though and kill those perl libxml binding deps at the same time.  I
</I>&gt;<i>doubt anybody is using the old metadata engine at this point, and if
</I>&gt;<i>they are, now is the time to force them to upgrade to gapi-fixup, before
</I>&gt;<i>1.0 hits the streets.  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Also,  the makefile.win32's are the preferred way to build still?  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Maybe I can integrate the cygwin build in the auto* stuff, if that make 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>things easier.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If you are willing to work on this, I will buy you beers next time we
</I>&gt;<i>meet.  I'd love to have an integrated win32 build, and we arguably need
</I>&gt;<i>it for beta2 since we want to install strongnamed/GACd assemblies on
</I>&gt;<i>win32 and need the AssemblyInfo.cs.in configure expansion step, etc...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Well, I looked at it after posting and I can build all the managed stuff 
ok just by using csc-style compile commands in the Makefile.am's, and a 
couple other small things.  I ran into one problem where csc wont work 
with 'generated/*.cs' and I had to conditionally use /recurse:*.cs instead.
The unmanaged/cygwin stuff will take me some more time to look into.
