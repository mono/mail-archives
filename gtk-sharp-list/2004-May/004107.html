So that you can use a common interface between TreeStore and ListStore
without worry about which one it is. (and other c or potentially with
vlad's patch c# Stores)

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, not 'only' because of it, but that's the issue I decided to argue

</I>&gt;<i> already, so erm... never mind.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Basically, you should treat these interfaces as abstract classes, not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interfaces.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And believe it or not, existing gtk+ developers moving to gtk# are one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the prime targets of gtk#.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The inconsistency is the annoying bit.  Why does ITreeNode have the
</I>&gt;<i> preceding I, for instance?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Because ITreeNode is designed to be implemented by the user (read:
average developer who is using the NodeStore (which is nobody most
likely, because it hasnt been finished)).
