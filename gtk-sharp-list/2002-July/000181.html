I don't think there really is a lot of architectural detail for the
project. We're working on creating a nice set of APIs for accessing
gtk+/GNOME-related libraries for C#, that's about it.

Right now, we generate bindings for glib, atk, pango, gtk+ (including
gdk and gdk-pixbuf), libgnome, libgnomecanvas, libgnomeui and gtkhtml
(from the gnome-2-port branch). These are all gnome2 libraries, we do
not support gnome1 libraries.

Right now we're working on fixing remaining bugs in the marshaling code
(Mike and Rachel) and I'll be finishing up porting testgtk/gtk-demo to
C#.
