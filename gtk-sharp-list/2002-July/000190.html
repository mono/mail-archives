<PRE>Hello Philip!

&gt;<i> I once told myself, if I succeed in doing all that; I start helping the
</I>&gt;<i> mono project. The best way I can do this is (I think) by helping the
</I>&gt;<i> gtk-sharp guys. Maybe thats not true, then please correct me :)
</I>
I am glad that you want to help the Gtk# guys, and your background is
great for this particular task.  Welcome to the team.  As every other
project that is heavily under development, there is not a lot of
documentation, but you should be able to get to speed quickly.

Also Mike and Rachel (the main developers today) hang out in the #mono
channel in irc.gnome.org, as well as Duncan that has written various of
the sample tests.

You might want to exercise the API by writing small applications and see
what is missing, helping then doing those pieces.

Miguel
