Okay, I have added that channel to my auto-join list. (my nickname is
freax).

Okay. I am going to checkout the gtk-sharp (and probably some parts of
mono too) sourcecode this weekend if I find some time for it, after
that i'll start creating a few sample applications with components of
which I think stuff might be missing...etc etc

Today I have quick-browsed trough the sourcecode of gtk-sharp and
whoohoo, it's not that difficult to understand how it's coded. So I
guess that I should be able to get to speed quickly indeed.

I guess patches and bugfixes should be send -to the mailinglist(s)-in u.
diff format? cvs diff -u ? Ack, i'll first read the HACKING files and
the website before asking questions like this :).
