<PRE>I've been following the GTK# mailing list from its beginning and I have one
really large problem.  I'm not an awesome programmer by any stretch but
would love to help out if I could since I think the project is really
important.  However, my problem is, I can't seem to follow the architecture
of the whole project and what needs to be done.  Would someone mind
explaining it (excrutiating detail is good)?  I think this would be very
helpful.

Thanks for your help and patience in advance.

Dave Holz
