Take a look at the mono-tools CVS repository.  It marries the auto*
tools with Makefile-based projects, such as type-reflector.

The autoconf script is fairly simple &amp; straightforward, allowing people
to specify --prefix &amp; other common options, and these options are
forwarded to the Makefiles of sub-directories, allowing things to fit
together reasonably coherently.

&lt;snip/&gt;

</I>&gt;<i> C and C++ modules in cvs.gnome.org).
</I>
The auto* tools were *designed* for C and C++ modules, so that isn't
surprising.  C/C++ code *needs* the auto* tools, just to bring some
sanity to the world of #ifdef code and portability among platforms.

Managed code shouldn't have to deal with that, though.  That's what
managed code is for -- to abstract out the platform-specific details.

Of course, if you start getting platform-specific managed code (such as
heavy P/Invoke use, etc.), the auto* tools will be useful.  But I don't
think we want to encourage heavy use of platform-specific code.

So I would vote for either Makefiles or NAnt.

&gt;<i> So in a way there is a common method for distributing buildscripts for C and
</I>&gt;<i> C++ applications. Packagers know about this method and if the creator of the
</I>&gt;<i> script follows some guidelines, creating packages becomes an easy task and
</I>&gt;<i> automated, I assume?!
</I>
C/C++ apps have the following simple pattern:

	./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install

We could instead have:

	make &amp;&amp; make install

or

	nant &amp;&amp; nant install

So I don't see a major difference, except possibly for common configure
options, such as --prefix.  But this can be done with minimal use of the
auto* tools (again, see mono-tools).

&gt;<i> So.. My suggestion is
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or we create a new sledge hammer to build .NET applications in a platform
</I>&gt;<i> independent way
</I>
I suppose we could try to clone msbuild,  whenever that becomes
available.

&gt;<i> Or we all start yelling: use Nant (which looks like a good option to me)
</I>
A nice option, but it does increase the dependencies.  You need NAnt
installed in order to build the apps.

&gt;<i> Or we all start yelling: Create your custom makefiles
</I>
Possible (I've done this), but people seem to hate make for some
reason...

&gt;<i> Or we all start yelling: Use auto* in this ... way
</I>
This is a bad idea.  Just my opinion.

&gt;<i> As far as I know is Gtk-Sharp, as a programming environment, ready for real
</I>&gt;<i> life usage (agreed, there are some showstopping bugs, oh well). The things
</I>&gt;<i> that really keep stopping me are the questions like how I should distribute
</I>&gt;<i> my application in a Unix environment. 
</I>
Distribute in .zip files? :-)

Installation would be simple: unzip &amp; move.

(Unless, of course, you make use of shared assemblies, but I suspect
most apps require them.  Besides, mono doesn't have a GAC yet, so we
can't really support shared assemblies properly anyway.)

&gt;<i> How I build buildscripts so that
</I>&gt;<i> packagers can easily build packages that depend on a .NET environment and
</I>&gt;<i> Gtk-Sharp.
</I>
This could use a more detailed answer.  Again, I'll suggest mono-tools,
but I'm sure there are better ways to do it.

&gt;<i> How do I use po files for translations, and how do I make the
</I>&gt;<i> lives of the translators as easy as humanly possible (not all of them are
</I>&gt;<i> professionals, you know)?
</I>
I'd like an answer to this as well.
