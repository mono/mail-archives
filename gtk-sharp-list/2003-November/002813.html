Good point.

I was wondering how Glade apps were translated, anyway...

&lt;snip what=&quot;auto* stuff&quot;/&gt;

I fail to see how auto* makes packagers lives easier.

Actually, that's an almost-lie.  The one thing that auto* tools make
easy is simple generation of the &quot;make distcheck&quot; target, which (in
turn) requires the ability to place compiled binaries outside of the
src-dir.

While somewhat useful, I don't think this is actually *required* by most
people, and I certainly can't imagine it being required for packaging.

(And yes, I've done packaging for the mono-tools CVS repository, to
generate RPMs in a somewhat automated fashion.  It required some support
from type-reflector's Makefile, mostly supporting the &quot;distdir&quot; target,
which makes it easy to make a .tar.gz from the source code, but nothing
*required* the auto* tools.)

&lt;snip/&gt;
&gt;<i> It seems that somebody needs to start thinking about such issues (like, when
</I>&gt;<i> once should use the auto* tools or when once should use Nant or or or custom
</I>&gt;<i> Makefiles or build using whatever new tool shipped with Mono. And how to do

</I>&gt;<i> everything down :). Soon!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe we could start a draft ?
</I>
That would likely be useful, but it is also likely to suffer from
opinion overload. :-)

Mostly because there is no &quot;one true answer.&quot;
