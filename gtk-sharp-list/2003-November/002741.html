I'm not terribly excited about this.  I think it's cleaner to obtain the
child label control and set the text on it.  Besides, changing the label
on a button is a good way to confuse your users, so it *should* be hard
to do.  :)

Cool, but this might be a tiny bit premature.  I am currently working on
a NodeStore for treeviews that is more C# friendly.  It might be better
to add the data binding to that.  And Gtk.Combo is a &quot;dead&quot; widget.  As
soon as packages for the upcoming Gtk+-2.4 are widely available, we will
be upgrading to it, and the new sexy Gtk.ComboBox.

So if this looks like it is going to be a lot of work to do this data
binding it might be good to hold off a little for the new API.
