&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Around this time last year I was looking into writing an app on Linux,
</I>&gt;<i> but put it off because Mono/Gtk-sharp etc. were still pretty early in
</I>&gt;<i> development.  Now I have become interested in this again and have been
</I>&gt;<i> thinking about developing a business app, and Mono and Gtk-sharp seem
</I>&gt;<i> pretty well along that this could actually work now.  The only issue I
</I>&gt;<i> would have is support for reports.  Most reports could be rendered in a
</I>&gt;<i> browser or PDF, but some would need to fit pre-printed forms like 1099's
</I>&gt;<i> (US tax form) for instance.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, I have been poking around the Gnome sites and it seems there isn't
</I>&gt;<i> much out there in the way of a visual report designer.  I did find
</I>&gt;<i> however gda-reports, which appears provides all the back end
</I>&gt;<i> functionality one needs to provide rich reports as well as the ability
</I>&gt;<i> to embed Gnome objects (err, Bonobo objects?) in a report.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Gda-sharp is listed on the monodoc site for gtk-sharp, but I think the
</I>&gt;<i> monodoc on go-mono
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://go-mono.com:8080/monodoc.ashx?link=root:/classlib-gnome">http://go-mono.com:8080/monodoc.ashx?link=root:/classlib-gnome</A>) is
</I>&gt;<i> broken, nothing is coming up for me when I click on items in the Type
</I>&gt;<i> column.  I was just wondering if these bindings exist.  Actually, I am
</I>&gt;<i> also wondering if gda-reports is complete at all as well, all I turned
</I>&gt;<i> up on google are some mailing list archives from 2001 and earlier.  A
</I>&gt;<i> google search turned up that Gda bindings were checked in in 2002.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, I could just programmatically generate all of the reports by
</I>&gt;<i> manually creating XML templates for gda-reports (err, I think), but the
</I>&gt;<i> typical end user of this type of app would need to have an easy way to
</I>&gt;<i> go in and tweak things, which means supplying some sort of basic visual
</I>&gt;<i> report designer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So... my question is do the gda bindings include the gda-reports piece?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>no, not yet. We could probably add them for libgda 1.2 bindings though.

cheers
