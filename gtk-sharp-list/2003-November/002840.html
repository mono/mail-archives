<PRE>Ok, so I think I finally figured what's wrong :
	TextIter.ForwardSearch  has a bug !

from gedit sources :
gedit-view.c:   /* FIXME: it does not select the last char of the buffer
*/

I thought this was a bug in gedit but I think it is a bug in
forward_search all the way into gtk+ .

I think it would be really nice if I could add this remark in monodoc.

Of course when I was testing my program, I started to search for the
word &quot;text&quot; and wrote :

Why can't I find this f!@#$%g text
                  
Since &quot;text&quot; was the last word in the buffer and since &quot;t&quot; was the last
char, it never found it. Of course some times when I wrote

This f!@#$%g thing can't find text, I don't believe it.

And it found it, it made me thought that I was doing something wrong. 

Is there a better way to find out about known bugs in Gtk+ ?
