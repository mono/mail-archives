<PRE>I understand from your message that under Gtk# managed objects are
prevented to be GC'ed, and queued to be dereferenced in the unmanaged
code. Your code should work as it allows idle cycles to happen
(yielding). I will try it out on my Gtk# application and let you know if
it works.

Now, I still have a question beyond Gtk#, and more related to the Mono
runtime. 

Please accept my apologies if I am getting it wrong, but I assimilate
the mono VM to a JVM, where both GUI and non GUI managed applications
run on a managed memory heap. Roughly speaking, on a JVM, if after a
marking cycle from the GC thread, there is not enough marked objects to
be reclaimed to leave enough free memory for a requested allocation, the
actual heap is expanded up. If the max heap is reached, and there is
still more memory requested, then the application crashes with an out of
memory error. 

In my sample using mono, I would expect the VM GC mark policy, whichever
policy is used, to limit the amount of memory used, as the test objects
are not kept referenced, at least by the application code. So either,
the GC mark and sweep is not happening, or something else is keeping a
reference to the objects that prevents finalization. Instead, CPU sky
rockets, and the system starts swapping memory until freeze.

Could somebody please give me some light? My experience from heavily
loaded server-side applications, enterprise level, ist that optimized GC
is critical for system performance.

Thanks!
Bruno

public class Test
{
        ~Test ()
        {
                Console.WriteLine (&quot;Finalized&quot;);
        }
                                                                                                                                                                                   
        public static void Main ()
        {
                for (long i = 10000000000; i &gt; 0; i--)
                        new Test ();
        }
}
