Probably needs some ref magic on the Reparent method.  Please file a bug
for this and attach your sample proggie.

The real problem as I see it is that public Button (string) should be
calling gtk_button_new_from_stock, since that falls back to
new_with_mnemonic if the string isn't a stock id.  If the preferred ctor
were set properly, you could just chain up to the string ctor and forget
about this reparenting hack.

Anyone up for some metadata hacking?  

If not, please file a bug for that and I'll get to it as soon as
possible. If you need a workaround in the meantime, you could always
just PInvoke gtk_button_new_from_stock directly in your ctor and assign
the returned handle to Raw. Take a look at the NewFromStock method in
the generated source for the specifics.
