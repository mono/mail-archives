<PRE>Thanks a lot Jon for a clear explanation! I had been wondering for a
long time about the finalization problem. You are right, in Java the
finalization is not deterministic, but the collection is, and that's
probably the main difference with the Bohem GC. I did not know about
per-generation finalization in .NET, so I think I have some reading to
do :)

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unlike Java, .NET/CIL/Mono (eventually) will make an effort to run
</I>&gt;<i> object finalizers (Object.Finalize).  However, finalizers are run
</I>&gt;<i> specially: when a &quot;dead&quot; (unreferenced) object is found, the finalizer
</I>&gt;<i> isn't run immediately; instead, the object is placed on a finalization
</I>&gt;<i> queue, and during the NEXT GC the objects on the finalization queue are
</I>&gt;<i> executed.  Or, the objects in the finalization queue are run on a
</I>&gt;<i> separate thread.  Whatever.  Also note that the finalization queue is
</I>&gt;<i> per-generation, so if it's a Gen-2 object that was placed on the
</I>&gt;<i> finalization queue, it may not be until app-exit that the finalizer is
</I>&gt;<i> run.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Problem #1 is that everything that derives from GLib.Object has a
</I>&gt;<i> finalizer, and thus has the above deferred behavior with the GC system.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This, however, isn't the major problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The major problem is Problem #2 (as far as you're concerned), which is
</I>&gt;<i> that the gtk-sharp library is keeping a reference to all GLib objects. 
</I>&gt;<i> GLib.Object.PerformQueuedUnrefs is fully-managed code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, your understanding is correct, it's just that another library
</I>&gt;<i> (gtk-sharp) is keeping a reference to your objects (Pixbufs) without you
</I>&gt;<i> realizing it.  This is handled by the GLib.Object constructor &amp; related
</I>&gt;<i> methods, so *every* GLib.Object-derived class will exhibit this
</I>&gt;<i> behavior.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To get gtk-sharp to remove it's reference to your objects, you need to
</I>&gt;<i> let it run GLib.Object.PerformQueuedUnrefs, which requires running the
</I>&gt;<i> idle handler.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Due to Problem #1, there will be a delay before the memory is generally
</I>&gt;<i> usable.  First you need to perform the queued unrefs, then the GC will
</I>&gt;<i> realize that the objects are unreachable, and (if GC.SuppressFinalize
</I>&gt;<i> hasn't been called on the object), the objects will be placed on the
</I>&gt;<i> finalization queue and collected on the NEXT GC (again, for that GC
</I>&gt;<i> generation).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note that invoking Dispose() on the objects will call
</I>&gt;<i> GC.SuppressFinalize, so calling Dispose will remove the need to wait for
</I>&gt;<i> the 2nd GC to collect memory.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Where mono differs from the above is that the Boehem GC is used, and
</I>&gt;<i> things are still in flux, so it is less likely for finalizers to be
</I>&gt;<i> invoked.  This will likely change (if it hasn't been fixed already), as
</I>&gt;<i> we get a better GC infrastructure.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I understand from your message that under Gtk# managed objects are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; prevented to be GC'ed, and queued to be dereferenced in the unmanaged
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code. Your code should work as it allows idle cycles to happen
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (yielding). I will try it out on my Gtk# application and let you know if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it works.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now, I still have a question beyond Gtk#, and more related to the Mono
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; runtime. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please accept my apologies if I am getting it wrong, but I assimilate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the mono VM to a JVM, where both GUI and non GUI managed applications
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; run on a managed memory heap. Roughly speaking, on a JVM, if after a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; marking cycle from the GC thread, there is not enough marked objects to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be reclaimed to leave enough free memory for a requested allocation, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; actual heap is expanded up. If the max heap is reached, and there is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; still more memory requested, then the application crashes with an out of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; memory error. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In my sample using mono, I would expect the VM GC mark policy, whichever
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; policy is used, to limit the amount of memory used, as the test objects
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are not kept referenced, at least by the application code. So either,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the GC mark and sweep is not happening, or something else is keeping a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reference to the objects that prevents finalization. Instead, CPU sky
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rockets, and the system starts swapping memory until freeze.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Could somebody please give me some light? My experience from heavily
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; loaded server-side applications, enterprise level, ist that optimized GC
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is critical for system performance.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The problem is that you're not a GUI app. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; PerformQueuedUnrefs is called from the Idle handler for the GUI.  The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Idle handler is run whenever the GUI is not busy.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (Recall that GUIs are event-driven, so if the user isn't doing anything,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and the app isn't doing anything, then the app is idle, so you can do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; background work during idle processing.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Your sample app doesn't have a GUI, so there's never an &quot;idle time&quot;, so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the idle handler is never run, so PerfrmQueuedUnrefs is never called.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Some possible solutions:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   - Insert the code:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 	while(GLib.MainContext.Iteration()) {
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 		// do nothing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 	}
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     This should explicitly run the idle handler.  This should be run
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     after the .Dispose() call.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   - Make Object.Dispose virtual, then make Pixbuf.Dispose free memory 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     immediately.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     This probably isn't a good idea, as GTK+ requires that all objects
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     be disposed from the same thread, which is what PerformQueuedUnrefs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     does (since the idle handler is only run on the GUI thread, so only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     one thread will ever do the unrefs).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     Pixbuf might not have this requirement, though.  I have no idea.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The first option is the safest and simplest option, if it works.  Please
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; try it and let us know.
