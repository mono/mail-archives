Okay, in that case I am not going to create such a patch. Still I belive
that integration with the way of working in the .NET world should be
considered at some point. Perhaps using wrapper classes that actually
make stuff look more like the nice C#-way of doing things...

using Gtk;

public class Whatever 
{
  public Whatever () 
  {
    Button b = new Button ();
    b.Label = &quot;test&quot;;
  }
}


and

using GtkSharper;

public class Whatever 
{
   public Whatever ()
   {
       Button b = new Button ();

       // and then..

       Label l = b.Label;
       l.Text = &quot;test&quot;;

       // and/or

       b.Text = &quot;test&quot;;
   }
}



&gt;<i> &gt; I am also thinking about adding a Databind ()-method and a DataSource
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; property to widgets like the Gtk.Combo and Gtk.TreeView.
</I>
&gt;<i> Cool, but this might be a tiny bit premature.  I am currently working on
</I>&gt;<i> a NodeStore for treeviews that is more C# friendly.  It might be better
</I>&gt;<i> to add the data binding to that.  And Gtk.Combo is a &quot;dead&quot; widget.  As
</I>&gt;<i> soon as packages for the upcoming Gtk+-2.4 are widely available, we will
</I>&gt;<i> be upgrading to it, and the new sexy Gtk.ComboBox.
</I>
&gt;<i> So if this looks like it is going to be a lot of work to do this data
</I>&gt;<i> binding it might be good to hold off a little for the new API.
</I>
Okay, in that case waiting seems to be the best option :). But I am
already looking forward to do things _like_

DataSet ds = new DataSet ();
ds.Tables.Add (&quot;root&quot;);
ds.Tables.Add (&quot;Level1&quot;);
ds...

TreeView tree = new TreeView ();
tree.DataSource = ds;

For example the Infragistics treeview .net components (afaik both the
WebNavigator and the Winforms stuff) work like this. Maybe taking a look
at their API is a smart move ;) as a lot .NET developers are already
used to that way of working.
