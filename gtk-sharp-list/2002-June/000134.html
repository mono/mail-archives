<PRE>Announcing release 0.2.1 of Gtk#, codenamed &quot;Perhaps 1 day too many.&quot;

This is a quickfix release to add a missing file from the 0.2 release
tarball.  Otherwise, it is identical to 0.2.

Source tarball available for download at your convenience from:

<A HREF="http://gtk-sharp.sourceforge.net/">http://gtk-sharp.sourceforge.net/</A>

About Gtk#:

Gtk# is C# language binding for the Gtk+ Graphical User Interface
toolkit.  Well, that's understating it a bit.  It's really a set of
classes in IL assemblies which can be accessed by any .Net compatible
language.  To this date, Gtk# has been seen in the wild under the
control of C# and LOGO code. People are now starting to do significant
things with Gtk#, but it is still largely unproven and not recommended
for production work.

Changes since 0.2:

- added missing mkinstalldirs script to the release tarball. 

Please see release 0.2 announcement at:

<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/gtk-sharp-list/2002-June/000124.html">http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/gtk-sharp-list/2002-June/000124.html</A> 
for the substantial amount of progress made since 0.1

Discussion of Gtk# occurs at <A HREF="mailto:gtk-sharp-list@ximian.com.">gtk-sharp-list@ximian.com.</A>  Questions and
bug reports should be directed there.
