So, I've been thinking about this some more.  The introspection stuff is
no doubt what the good folks at NDoc are doing.  I'm copying Jason on
this, because I recall him being involved in NDoc.  

I tried NDoc with the Gtk# dll's and am getting reflection errors
starting with the pango assembly.  When I try to build just the glib
docs, I get a failure because it's trying to create an MS help file of
some sort, which I don't even want.  I'd rather just have a set of HTML
files to distribute/post on the website.

So Jason, or anyone else in the know on NDoc, any chance of getting some
love on the above issues?  If you want to look at the pango ndoc
failure, you can build gtk-sharp with the /doc switch with the command
&quot;make -f makefile.win32 docs&quot; on win32.

Thanks,
Mike
