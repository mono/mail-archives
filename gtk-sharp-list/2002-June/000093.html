The mono runtime has logic to look for .so dynamic libs.  I have no
experience with rotor and how its DllImport mechanism works.  If it
requires the full library name (with .so extension) then this may need
to be handled via some attribute magic to map the library names for
bsd/rotor.  There is going to need to be some similar mapping done to
the libgtk-win32* lib names.

Thanks for looking into this.

It would be a big help if you could send me a diff, or open a bug in
bugzilla and post the diff there.  Also, I haven't had a chance to
unpack the attached tarball, but the name suggests that you were hacking
on the 0.1 release tree.  If that's the case, the build system has
changed a lot since that release, so reworking the patch against current
cvs would help too.  

Thanks,
Mike
