Thanks for the patch! This was next on my list (bug 25792, which I'll
close now unless you want to do the honors.)  I was planning on leaving
the classes directly under the Gdk namespace to avoid possible confusion
for folks who are familiar with the Gdk API already.  I think we can
leave it as is for now, and adjust accordingly if the FAQs start rolling
in...

I need to get some more meat into the generated API docs, and get them
posted up on the Gtk# homepage.

&gt;<i> As a side effect, GError is now mapped to GLib.GException automatically.

Very Nice! Thanks for filling that hole.

Mike
