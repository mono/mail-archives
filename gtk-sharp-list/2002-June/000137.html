I installed the &quot;web setup release&quot; and unless I'm daft (entirely likely), 
I didn't see an option to just build HTML.  Maybe that's in the CVS version?
Anyway, the HTML definitely was not in the output directory that I specified.
Is it built in temp space somewhere?

Yes, specifically, it's pango-sharp.dll, and the corresponding extracted
doc file is pango-sharp-docs.xml.  I appreciate you taking a look. There are
assemblies and doc files built in the glib, pango, atk, gdk, and gtk dirs
of the gtk-sharp tree, and several of them produce Reflection failures
in NDoc.
