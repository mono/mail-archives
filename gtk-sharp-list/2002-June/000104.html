There is already a bug logged on this, and I've discussed it with
several folks on irc as well.  My goal is to have methods be present
tense and signals be past tense whenever collisions occur. For example,
the EmitAdd wart that every whines about immediately upon seeing the
example code would resolve to an Add method and an Added signal. The
EmitAdd solution was simple and mechanical and at least got things
compiling quickly.

I am trying to decide whether to resolve these collisions when
generating XML, or in the code generator.  I'm inclined to do it in the
XML production, because then any other OO languages that choose to reuse
the XML will not need to work around it in their code generators.
