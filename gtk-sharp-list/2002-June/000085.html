Actually, I haven't checked that code in yet, so the build is still intact.

Based on the increase of irc questions since the announcement of the successful
linux build, it looks important to the project to keep the linux build clean.
I'm going to put code that exposes mcs bugs on branches or keep it private
until the mcs bugs are fixed.  Of course, that's a pain, so I appreciate you
staying on top of them.  I just don't want to risk alienating all these new
testers that seem to be coming forward now by breaking the linux build.  :)
