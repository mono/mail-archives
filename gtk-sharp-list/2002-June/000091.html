<PRE>So, I have been careful to make sure my stuff builds on linux (since I
develop there and only there). Sometimes I have forgotten to get my mcs
fixes committed before committing to gtk-sharp, but I'd like to think I
haven't committed any major goofs. Anyway, the following issues may
trick you into thinking Gtk# is utterly broken on linux:

1) You get nine million errors while compiling.
Answer: Mcs is being dumb and referencing your installed libs before the
compiled ones. I am looking into fixing the path resolution in mcs to
honor -L first, in the meantime, if you run &quot;make install&quot; it will
install the libs as they are compiled, which fixes the problem.

2) No make target in gdk.imaging
Answer: Rerun autogen.sh, so that configure will be regenerated from the
updated configure.in, and then configure will create the new Makefile.
Sadly there's not much way around this; even if we went fully
automake/autoconf it would not work correctly, I've seen this same
problem in GNOME countless times.

3) You seem to have the same class in both Gdk and Gdk.Imaging
Answer: Run &quot;make clean&quot; and rebuild. The build blindly compiles
anything and everything in generated/, if you have old classes there, it
will compile them as well. It may be useful to have codegen.exe generate
a list of files to compile; if this was then incorporated into the build
process it would eliminate the problem.
