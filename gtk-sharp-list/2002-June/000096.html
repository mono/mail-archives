<PRE>A fix to the &quot;EmitAdd&quot; problem that doesn't require extensive metadata
hacking occured to me last night:

As far as I can tell, nearly all[1] of the signal/method collisions in
which the method truly only emits a signal are void(void) methods. So
perhaps the resolution process should look like:

a) If the method signature is void(void), prepend &quot;Emit&quot; to the method.
b) Elsewise, append &quot;Emitted&quot; to the signal.

Thoughts?

[1] In the case of the GtkEditable interface, GtkEntry for some bizarre
reason defines a CopyClipboard signal _and_ implements a void(void)
CopyClipboard method from GtkEditable. Why the signal and method were
broken up I don't know, but I note this as an exception because
(currently) in such cross-interface collisions, one cannot perform the
resolution process I proposed, but instead change the name of whichever
collides in the implementing class.
