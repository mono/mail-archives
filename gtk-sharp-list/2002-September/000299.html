<PRE>Hello Ricardo!

&gt;<i>     After learning enough about reflection, I have implemented signal
</I>&gt;<i> autoconnection for libglade. Attached is the patch and added files of
</I>&gt;<i> this implementation. Look at the test program to see how easy is to use
</I>&gt;<i> this.
</I>
This patch is very nice.  I like a lot the result.  

I find it funny that the result is a lot better than using Microsoft
tools to design GUIs ;-)

&gt;<i>     - Mapping from glib signal names (like &quot;enter&quot;) to Gtk# event names
</I>&gt;<i>     (like &quot;Entered&quot;). To solve this, I have had to modify Gtk# code
</I>&gt;<i>     generation to add a custom attribute to the generated events. The
</I>&gt;<i>     attribute marks all events generated from glib signals, and stores
</I>&gt;<i>     the original name (cname). This is the cleaner way that I could
</I>&gt;<i>     think of doing this.
</I>
I think that this is a very clean approach.

&gt;<i>     - I have implemented the case when the handler object is specified
</I>&gt;<i>     in the glade file, but I think it is totally useless because
</I>&gt;<i>     signatures of handler methods have to match exactly (unlike in C).
</I>
Agreed

&gt;<i>     - I'm not sure of what to do when no signal handler is found. Should
</I>&gt;<i>     this throw an exception? For now it just shows a message...
</I>
Throwing an exception seems like the right thing to do.

Miguel
