It doesn't look like Rachel updated generator/makefile.win32 to account
for the parser/generator restructuring.  There are bigger obstacles in
the way of Gtk# on win32, though.  We need the per-assembly
configuration file loading functionality in the runtime so that we can
deal with the differences in dll names between linux and win32.
Currently, the dllnames default to the x11 names.  We also need some
build system magic to get the glue library building.  

Since all of the contributors to Gtk# at this point are developing on
linux, these issues have taken a bit of a backseat, unfortunately. There
are already bugzilla entries for the two additional problems I
mentioned, but I'd like to revamp the build system soon to merge the
win32 and x11 builds back together.  I've opened bug 30332 to document
the problem.
