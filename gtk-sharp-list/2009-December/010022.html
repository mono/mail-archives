<PRE>Hi All,

I have few questions about the Gtk.TreeView, my program is as same as the TreeView example provided here <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/GtkSharp_TreeView_Tutorial">http://www.mono-project.com/GtkSharp_TreeView_Tutorial</A>

1. How can I get the integer position of the selected TreeIter?

2. How to remove the child nodes of selected TreeIter?
    Currently I'm following the steps to achive this,
        1. Get the parent Iter,
        2. Create a newTreeIter with selectedTreeIter details, and remove the selectedTreeIter (this removes the child iter's)
        3. Append the newTreeIter with the reference of parentIter
        OR
        2. InserftNodeAfter / InsertNodeBefore with sibling as selectedTreeIter to parentIter, this returns newIter, and remove the selectedIter
        3. Set the column values for newIter
    Is there any methods which I can use to remove the child iters of given treeIter?

3. How can I enumerate through the child iters? Wondering why there is no GetIterNext(Gtk.TreeIter selectedIter)?

Please suggest me.

Thanks in Advance,
Karthikeyan R
