Nope, it wasn't improved in 2.4.3. It still uses the 2.17.x+patches
that 2.4.2.3_4 used. We need to rebase our patches on top of 2.18.x
and ship that, but it's a lot of work to rebase, and make sure that
it's stable and doesn't have regressions. There are also some specific
issues affecting MD that we'd like to resolve before making everyone
download a new package.

</I>
Exactly. I'd also point out that MonoDevelop uses the same version of
GTK+ that any other GTK# app on Mac gets, but we have some hacks and
fixes in MD itself for a few issues, since it's usually much easier to
patch specific issues in MD itself than to build and test a new Mono
framework, and make everyone download and install the 50MB package.
