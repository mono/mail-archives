The &quot;wizards&quot; behind MonoDevelop are the primary contributors to the
Gtk# distribution for mac.  As has been described by others, Gtk# on the
mac is mostly limited by Gtk+ on the mac, which is a work in progress
and is improving steadily.  If you want it to improve faster and be more
&quot;well-cared for&quot;, we would welcome your contributions.

My understanding is that we are shipping a custom patched gtk+ in our
mac installer.  Whether it improved in 2.4.3 and just wasn't documented
in the release notes is not something I can speak to confidently.
Perhaps Michael Hutchinson can comment on that.

Gtk# on the mac is not rotting.  It is important to many people.
Unfortunately, there are a considerably larger number of people who want
Gtk# to work on mac than there are people who have been willing to
contribute anything to make it work.
