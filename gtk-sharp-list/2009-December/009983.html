We really need Mac users to stand up and participate in fixing bugs.
I did this for a while, but I don't use or enjoy OS X so my interest
is near zero.

This was a complex problem. &#160;It stems from not having real
multi-monitor support in the gtk+ quartz backed. &#160;It was added to git
master after the 2.18 branch.

These might be of interest for some background information

See above bugs for more info. &#160;They have links to a few others which
are relative.

</I>
This was caused by missing gdk transpose implementation. &#160;It was added
as part of multi-monitor support. &#160;Essentially what is supposed to
happen is a region of the screen in the video buffer is supposed to
get shifted up or down a given number of pixels. &#160;The code to
determine the right section and move it was missing/incorrect.

&gt;<i> If I take my .exe over to Linux, these problems disappear.
</I>
Expected, the Linux version of gtk+ is what developers test with. &#160;For
better or worse, Mac and Windows support lags slightly behind when
major restructuring occurs. &#160;The maintainers, however, are quite
talented and filing bugs w/ test cases helps drastically. &#160;This is
where knowing C is helpful. &#160;If that is a problem, I'm willing to
write test-cases in exchange for donations to the Gnome foundation ;-)

I know it sounds like a lot to ask, but it's invaluable.

&gt;<i> If these problems are unknown, I can try to reduce my program down to
</I>&gt;<i> something smaller that exhibits them. If these problems are known, are
</I>&gt;<i> there plans around fixing them for Mono 2.4.x or Mono 2.6?
</I>
Check out gnome.bugzilla.org for gtk+ bugs related to the issues you
are having. &#160;(I search for &quot;gtk quartz&quot;). &#160;The chances of the bugs
being in Gtk# are much less than it being in gtk+ directly.

&gt;<i> I originally thought GTK# would be well cared for because major apps
</I>&gt;<i> use it, like MonoDevelop for Mac. But now I'm thinking that the
</I>&gt;<i> wizards behind such apps are using a &quot;custom GTK#&quot; they tweaked to
</I>&gt;<i> work for them while the main GTK# distribution, um, ... rots? Sorry
</I>&gt;<i> for the strong word, but I don't see any GTK# love in these release
</I>&gt;<i> notes...
</I>
My gtk+ tree which was used in Mono was the same tree I was using to
fix MonoDevelop on OS X. &#160;I've been meaning to rebase my tree on gtk+
master, but my job keeps me busy fixing Linux.

As it were, most companies I've dealt with that ship a gtk+
application have shipped their own gtk+ libraries.

FWIW, you may want to dive down the rabbit hole and build an entire
Mono and Gtk# stack from source. &#160;I wont lie, it's not easy. &#160;However,
it will give you the ability to try out gtk+ 2.19 to see all the
magical bugs that are fixed.

If you set that up, after its done, you can run:

&#160;$ jhbuild shell
&#160;$ git clone <A HREF="git://git.gnome.org/gtk+">git://git.gnome.org/gtk+</A>
&#160;$ cd gtk+
&#160;$ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$PREFIX
&#160;$ make
&#160;$ make install

If autogen doesn't work, you can try running autoreconf -fiv.

Cheers, and good luck,
