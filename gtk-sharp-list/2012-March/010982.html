<PRE>Thanks for providing the info on how to fix broken JPEG loading.  I'm
surprised the issue isn't mentioned anywhere else.  Maybe it's my weak
search skills but I couldn't find an answer anywhere until I came here and
found your message.

One thing though.  I had to do the opposite of what you mentioned in step 3. 
I had to rename libjpeg7.dll to libjpeg-7.dll.  Still it fixed the problem,
so thanks again for providing the fix.  I doubt I would have had the
patience to track that down on my own.

When I ran gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders.exe I noticed that there were a couple
of other libraries it couldn't find.  One was the TIFF library.  I haven't
tried renaming that one as well to see if it would fix the problem since I
don't expect to be loading any TIFF files.  I just thought I'd mention it.
