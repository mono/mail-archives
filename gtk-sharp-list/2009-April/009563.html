<PRE>Hi folks,

after quite some time the patch implementing virtual method support in 
the generator is finally in SVN.

Naturally, a patch of this size is never free of bugs, but we have to 
stabilize trunk in the upcoming months for the approaching release of 
Gtk# 2.14. That's why we'd be great for any volunteer willing to install 
Gtk# from trunk. As always, bugs can be reported at 
www.mono-project.com/Bugs.

One of the downsides of the patch is that we had to bump up the .net 
framework to 2.0 (see previous mailing list discussion). By now, we also 
have a Mono 2.4 dependency, but that will change soon when Mike has 
fixed the autoconf stuff which will introduce a compiler flag for 
backwards compatibility. Package maintainers should always define that 
flag to avoid the 2.4 dependency.

I hope you like the patch (you can now override CellRenderer.Activate 
and many others :-)  ).

Christian
