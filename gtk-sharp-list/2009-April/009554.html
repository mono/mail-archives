<PRE>Hi Christian,

Thanks for your feedback. On my test system I made sure, that the only file left is the libgtk-win32-2.0-0.dll with the new version. And on my devolopment machine the version is 2.14.7 and on both systems I have the issue. It might turn out to be something totally different. The Gtk+ version on the vmware image is 2.12.9 and the issue does not occur.
Maybe this is something different that came up in a later release of gtk+ and is not related to the bug I originally found! I will try to test with an older version on Windows and with a newer version on the vmware image now.

Thanks and reagrds,

Philip

No, this is definetly not a Gtk# bug. Gtk# only pinvokes Gtk+ functions; the behavior of the application is determined entirely by Gtk+.

Well as that bug was fixed in 2.13.x replacing all the Gtk+ files shipped with Gtk# should solve your problem. Did you really override the 
Gtk+ files? Just installing Gtk+ could cause Gtk# to stick to the old
version. You need to use the Gtk+ bundle from <A HREF="http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html">http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html</A> and override all the files.

If it still doesn't work, you should write a mail to the gtk+ lists.
