The problem is most likely that translation is enable in an MD Gtk#
project.  This causes a reference to Mono.Posix to be added to the
project and any user visible strings will use the Catalog class to
retrieve localized strings.  

The Gtk# for .net installer does not currently ship Mono.Posix, though
it has been suggested recently that we should add it.  

In the meantime, you have a few options I can think of: 

1) if you aren't currently translating any of those UI strings, you
could disable translation via the MD project options. 

2) grab a mono combined installer and manually gac the Mono.Posix
assembly from it using gacutil.

3) we will be releasing an installer in the next couple days which
contains Mono.Posix, Mono.GetOptions, monodoc, Mono.Addins and maybe a
couple other libs from the mono stack for use on .Net.  This is part of
an effort to support building MonoDevelop on .Net.
