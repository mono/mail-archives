<PRE>Hey there,

it is great to hear that there is finally some interest in releasing the work that was done on Gtk# master during the last 4 years! I was an active developer when 2.12 was released. Afterwards, I did some generator improvements(virtual methods) and other gtk-sharp work(getting rid of the glue code etc.).

I already thought that gtk-sharp 3 would never ever be released. The interest in the binding declined, development virtually ceased and then Mike Kestner left the Mono project after it was moved to Xamarin.

I hope that there is enough interest and manpower behind this attempt to finally release something. At least we have the Banshee guys here, who stayed committed to gtk-sharp and pushed the 3.0 bindings forward.

So please, invest some time, try to build an installer and finally release the bindings. It would be worth the effort. The generator is much improved (virtual methods, generates less glue code than before). I don't know about the state of the gtk-sharp bindings, but hope that this is also better than before. I also hope that the project can stay alive, even without a regular committer.

I wish you all much success for your gtk-sharp release efforts!

Kind regards,

 -- Christian Hoff

</I>&gt;<i> Betreff: [Gtk-sharp-list] Towards GTK# 3.0
</I>
&gt;<i> Hi everyone,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm attending GUADEC (the GNOME conference), and during the first day,
</I>&gt;<i> I've been asked several times about the state of C# bindings for GTK+
</I>&gt;<i> 3.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A month ago, I was at the &quot;GNOME/Mono&quot; hackfest
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://live.gnome.org/Hackfests/GNOMEandMonoFestivalofLove2012">https://live.gnome.org/Hackfests/GNOMEandMonoFestivalofLove2012</A>), and
</I>&gt;<i> I did a bit of work on gtk-sharp master.
</I>&gt;<i> When I tried to run the Banshee GTK3 branch, the main issue I hit was
</I>&gt;<i> in fact a regression in GTK+ itself:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=679232">https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=679232</A>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess it's a good sign about the state of the bindings themselves. ;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I think we should try to push out a 2.99.0 release as soon as
</I>&gt;<i> possible. Of course, it needs to be marked as beta, and targeted for
</I>&gt;<i> applications developpers to start porting their apps and maybe provide
</I>&gt;<i> feedback.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What you guys think still needs to be done for that release, and
</I>&gt;<i> before a proper 3.0 release ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> --
