<PRE>Hi, I am a newbie to this list, and to Mono/GTK#. Have tried to google this
problem but couldn't find any solutions.

The problem is when I tried to install MonoDevelop-2.5.90.3 on a Windows
Vista Enterprise, SP2, I get the error message: 
Gtk# version 2.12.9 or greater must be installed.
Same when trying MonoDevelop-2.4.2.1.

Have tried to:
* (Re)Install 2.12.9 and 2.12.10
* Restart the PC
* Remove everything with GTK in the registry after uninstall

But still get the same error message.
I have collegues that get the same problem, and some that don't. Also using
Vista.

Have installed MSVS Express and Professional try out before installing this.
Don't know if that causes any problems? We are trying to evaluate if Mono
Develop is good enough for our purposes or if we have to buy the expensive
licenses from MS...

So, why does Mono-Develop not recognize the version of the installed GTK#?
