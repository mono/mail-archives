<PRE>Hola Miguel,

	I think Gtk.DotNet is a great feature. I am collaborating in the 
MonoUML project and, at this moment, we are using GnomeCanvas for the 
graphical engine, but I think GnomeCanvas is not the best option for 
this job, in addition it seems that GnomeCanvas will be deprecated for 
Gnome 3. So, we are thinking in use Cairo or System.Drawing for do the 
job. All our GUI is done in Gtk# we just want to change the graphical 
engine, so Gtk.DotNet is very appreciated feature.

With Cairo we have a problem. Apparently, there is no GtkCairo binding 
for Mono. In some of my experiments, I was using P/Invoke to be able to 
use Cairo in a Gtk container. I have been thinking about doing a 
GtkCairo binding for the MonoUML project.

&gt;<i>         * Do you use/need OpenGL?  If you do, how do you do it?
</I>
I am not using OpenGL right now, but I will need it in the near future. 
Integration between Tao Framework and Gtk# would be great. No only 
OpenGL is needed, but SDL, Cg, and all other cool things of Tao.


&gt;<i>         * What kind of samples are missing?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         * What kind of tutorials you would like to see?
</I>
One of the bigger problems than I have had when experimenting with Cairo 
and System.Drawing is the lack of documentation and examples. There are 
very few of them or, in the worst cases (like Gtk+Cairo), there is no one

That's all for now, I hope that Gtk # grows every day, you guys are 
doing an excellent work.

Saludos,

Manuel.
