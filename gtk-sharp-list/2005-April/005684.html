<PRE>Hi list,

I am programming a small bit of an app using Mono and Gtk# among other
things. Here are some questions that I'd like to have your thoughts on:

1/ I'm wondering how to make a multipath Gnome.Druid... I have tried
mapping DruidPage.Next() methods to a custom callback function that sets
the Druid.Page to the page I want, but the Next() is then called and I
always get one page too far. As a workaround while I don't have a better
solution, I'm setting Druid.Page to the page before the one I want to
display, but I have no reason to be happy about that. What am I
missing/doing wrong ?

2/ I am using the ListStore.Foreach method to go through all rows and
add them to an ArrayList based on some criteria. However, it looks like
it only iterates through the first row, and then stops. It is no big
deal since I can use a custom loop function, but I was wondering if it
was a known/normal behaviour. Am I the only one having this problem ?

3/ Back to the Gnome.Druid but in relation to glade this time: the first
and last pages I defined in glade, with text, title, etc. appear blanks
in my app. Does anybody else have this problem ?

4/ I am just wondering if this the normal behaviour even if I guess it
is: for a toggle button in a CellRendererToggle (might be the same
anywhere else, I haven't tried) to actually toggle, I have had to make a
callback function and link it to it. Is it the 'right thing to do'Â© ?

OK, I think I've taken enough of your time for the moment, so thanks to
those who'll find the time to help.
