<PRE>I have mono installed in the path
/usr/local/beagle/mono
I am trying to install gtk in the same path. So i did the following things

declare -x PKG_CONFIG_PATH=&quot;/usr/local/beagle/mono/lib/pkgconfig&quot;

./configure --prefix=/usr/local/beagle/mono
art-sharp.dll: yes
gnome-sharp.dll: no
glade-sharp.dll: yes
gda-sharp.dll: no
gnomedb-sharp.dll: no
svg-sharp.dll: yes
gtkhtml-sharp.dll: no
vte-sharp.dll: no

make
Make threw lots of warnings such as
warning: declaration of `index' shadows a global declaration
&lt;built-in&gt;:0: warning: shadowed declaration is here
Finally make failed with:

`gdk_screen_get_root_window'

I am clueless as to how to solve this. Any help in this regard would be 
appreciated.
