<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Well, it was a project using mint (instead of the
</I>&gt;<i> jit), but it is dead now (as fas as I know). Is there
</I>&gt;<i> a port of mono (jitter) for ARM to be used in embedded
</I>&gt;<i> devices like PDAs?
</I>
Ah, right.  The issue is the runtime, not Gtk# :-)

We have just purchased the equipment to complete the port and we should
be getting it on the next few weeks.

&gt;<i> Some people is using pygtk to develop for these
</I>&gt;<i> devices, and after asking to core GPE developers, they
</I>&gt;<i> think that using interpreters make the environment too
</I>&gt;<i> slow. Would Gtk# over mono jitter an option?
</I>
Absolutely.  They would also benefit from the fact that we could use AOT
to precompile the code to native code [1] so there would be no JIT
impact nor extra memory requirements. 

Miguel

[1] Speaking of size: currently Mono requires both the original file and
the compiled file to be present;  So some hacking would be needed to
trim out the CIL code from the first file.
