<PRE>Hello,

I know this is an old question and the last submit was in 2009. I am
repeating this question here to see whether or not the community has formed
the opinion that solution using  individual render as mentioned in 2008
&lt;<A HREF="http://mono.1490590.n4.nabble.com/different-color-rows-for-GtkTreeView-td1545511.html#a1545521">http://mono.1490590.n4.nabble.com/different-color-rows-for-GtkTreeView-td1545511.html#a1545521</A>&gt;  
is the only practical way.

I don't buy it that the grid alternate color is some system theme as some
alluded to. I know the TreeView.EvenRowColor is obtained from I suspect the
theme with the name &quot;even-row-color&quot;. I grep the entire system in my Mint-17
looking of gtkrc file for anything like that. I cannot find any. That may
explain why they both came back as 0.

To me it stands to reason that an application should be able to offer its
user a choice of even and odd row color relevant to that application and is
not dictated by the OS.

It would be nice to see TreeView has a property like EnableAlternateRowColor
much like enabling the grid line.

Furthermore, some suggests that by setting Widget.RulesHint to true would
work. It does not.

Finally is it possible to use RcStyle and through Widget.ModifyStyle to
change the TreeView to display alternate row color? I don't have any
information about RcStyle, any advice will me appreciated. In my grep of
gtkrc, I have come across xthickness and ythickness in grkrc files,
properties of RcStyle. 

The Rc file format for Python can be found  here
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.pygtk.org/pygtk2tutorial/sec-GTKRcFileFormat.html">http://www.pygtk.org/pygtk2tutorial/sec-GTKRcFileFormat.html</A>&gt;  . May be I
have to write an Rc File for my application just to have the even and odd
row with different color? Can I write an &quot;rc file&quot; in memory and then give
it to the application?
