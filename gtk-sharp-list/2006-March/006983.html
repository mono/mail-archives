<PRE>I am currently in the planning stages of an application that I was
orignally going to write in SharpDevelop for Microsoft Windows.
However, I have recently begun to use Linux as an operating system,
and I would like to also support my application on Linux via Mono. So
I had some newbie questions about GTK#. I appreciate your patience
with my efforts to learn about this technology. :]

Here are my questions:

How do you use Glade to design GTK# applications?

Is the Glade XML file simply parsed and the approporiate source code created?

If this is true, what utility performs this function?

Can this be done with Visual Basic .NET on Mono, or is GUI design with
Glade only supported for C#?

How does GTK# work, and how is it related to GTK+?

Does the Mono virtual machine actually make calls to the GTK runtime
at a binary level?

Is the code in C#, or other languages supported by Mono converted to
binary code that would match compiled C code that perform the same API
calls to GTK+?

Where can I learn more about how this all works so I can help with the
development efforts?

Who would I talk to about helping with the documentation, and how
would I get started in this effort?

Thanks,

Scott Huey
