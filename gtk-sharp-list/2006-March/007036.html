Mercury compiles to both C and IL, and has foreign language interfaces
to both C# and C.    Any functions not written in Mercury must have
foreign language definitions for both the IL backend and the C
backend, otherwise it will not be able to compile to both.  One option
for making the binding is to write foreign language calls to both C#
and C that are equivalent (eg. in C gtk_show_widget, and in C#
Widget.show).  The other option, which is considerably less work, is
to write a Mercury predicate show_widget that calls
gtk.set_property(Widget, &quot;visible&quot;, TRUE), and have set_property
defined in C as calling gtk_object_set, and in C# as some function
call along the lines of set_property(object, property_name, value),
which would have the effect of object.property_name = value (though
property_name would have to be converted from the form this_property
to ThisProperty, but that is trivial).

&gt;<i> &gt; Also, is it possible to pass data to a Gtk# handler and have it passed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; back to your callback via. the EventArgs parameter (as you can do with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the data parameter in Gtk+)?  This would be necessary for storing the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mercury procedure to call from the C# callback I register.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Gtk# paradigm for the user_data parameter is to create your delegate
</I>&gt;<i> from an instance method on a class and hold the data member in an
</I>&gt;<i> instance field.
</I>
However, that is impossible for Mercury.  Quoting from the reference manual:

&quot;The C# code from C# pragma foreign_proc declarations will be placed
in the bodies of static member functions of an automatically-generated
C# class. Since such C# code will become part of a static member
function, it must not refer to the this keyword.  It may however refer
to static member variables or static member functions declared with
pragma foreign_code.&quot;

The way I have implemented it in C is to register the callback with
the data parameter being the Mercury closure to call.  However, it
doesn't sound like this is possible with Gtk#.
