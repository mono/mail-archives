<PRE>I can help on some questions (I won't attempt the others):

&quot;How do you use Glade to design GTK# applications?&quot;
You install the glade designer and then in monodevelop you add that as a
resource.  For me I read oreilly's book, I think it was called Mono:
developers handbook.


&quot;Is the Glade XML file simply parsed and the approporiate source code
created?&quot;
As I understand, yes

&quot;Can this be done with Visual Basic .NET on Mono, or is GUI design with
Glade only supported for C#?&quot;
I've never used anything but C#

&quot;How does GTK# work, and how is it related to GTK+?&quot;
GTK# is simply C# binding made for GTK+, which is written in C

&quot;Who would I talk to about helping with the documentation, and how
would I get started in this effort?&quot;
Miguel Icasa most likely, he can give you access to the wiki and stuff.  The
documentation is in need of help (at least for new people) but the class
defenitions in monodoc is pretty far along.  I myself I been planning on
helping but haven't yet.

There is a new forum called www.gnomedev.com.  It's still pretty small but
you could certainly ask questions and contribute to it.

Thanks,
Clark
