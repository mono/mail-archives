<PRE>Guys,

I have a [related?] MASSIVE memory leak (60MB for 1024x768 pixbuf) when
I do the following:

  // INITIALLY load up the svg (XML) file for the one-line graphics
(into an XmlDoc) 
  xmlDoc = new System.Xml.XmlDocument();
  xmlDoc.Load(&quot;prettypicture.svg&quot;);
  // now we have an XML document that we can manipulate and
[re-]render...

  &lt; ... much code deleted here ... &gt;

  // PERIODICALLY [re-]render the SVG into the appropriate image Widget

  // (This snippet executes when the SVG xmlDoc has been modified by
other code)
  System.IO.MemoryStream streamSVG = new System.IO.MemoryStream();
  xmlDoc.Save(streamSVG);  // put the XML doc in a Stream
  streamSVG.Position = 0;  // reset the stream once written, this is
IMPORTANT!               
  imgWdgt.Pixbuf.Unref();  // this DRAMATICALLY slows the leak, but not
good enough
  imgWdgt.Pixbuf = null;   // this was just a guess, it has no effect...
  imgWdgt.Pixbuf = new Gdk.Pixbuf(streamSVG);  // probably actually uses
Rsvg?
  //System.GC.Collect();     // this was just a guess, it has no
effect...

I see a similar memory leak when directly the Rsvg library, so I'm
guessing that the problem is actually there (or in one of Rsvg's
dependancies, maybe libXML?), since I'm betting that Gtk.Pixbuf
implements it's SVG rendering capability by using rsgv?  Here's the Rsvg
version of the &quot;bitmap refresh&quot;:

  imgWdgt.Pixbuf.Unref();  // this DRAMATICALLY slows the leak, but not
good enough!
  imgWdgt.Pixbuf = null;   // this was just a guess, it has no effect...
  imgWdgt.Pixbuf = Rsvg.Pixbuf.LoadFromStream(streamSVG);       
  //System.GC.Collect();     // this was just a guess, it has no
effect...

I would really appreciate some light being shed on this too, as
presently I am shelling out to command-line rsvg to render a .png to
disk and then loading that, but that is not a work-able long term
solution for me (I will wear out my CF-only-based storage media!)...

Thanks,
Wes

Hi Jonathan,

I have just tried your test app and I am not seeing times near 1 second:

Frame 197: 116 msec
Frame 198: 148 msec
Frame 199: 106 msec

As for your first option, there is definitely a memory leak ocurring.  I
could not pinpoint where that is, but I believe you are incorrect in
thinking that it is the Gtk.DotNet.Graphics.FromDrawable (window) in the
Expose Event.  I do that exact thing with no such memory leak:
