This should not be the case.  As long as you are calling dispose on the
correct objects, that memory should be regained instantaneously.  In the
app I linked, I am constantly creating and destroying bitmaps without
any memory issues.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For that reason, it would really be best if I didn't have to create the

</I>&gt;<i> that I observed when drawing to the Pixmap.  Not to be pedantic, but I
</I>&gt;<i> forgot to mention in my original post that you need to change the value
</I>&gt;<i> passed to the PictureArea() constructor, inside of the MainWindow()
</I>&gt;<i> constructor, to false in order for it to use the pixmap option.  If you have
</I>&gt;<i> a chance to try this and see if you observe the 1 second times, that would
</I>&gt;<i> be great.  I hope I'm not asking too much here... I just can't understand
</I>&gt;<i> why it should be any slower to copy an image to a Pixmap than directly to a
</I>&gt;<i> DrawingArea.
</I>
Well your app defaulted to draw to the pixmap.  I had to switch the bool
to true to see the memory leak.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, if you know of any other way to display a
</I>&gt;<i> System.Drawing.Bitmap inside a Gtk window that might work better, I'm open
</I>&gt;<i> to suggestions.
</I>
Check out the code I linked.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Jonathan,

</I>&gt;<i> I have just tried your test app and I am not seeing times near 1 second:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am trying to port an open-source medical imaging application from 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; .NET to Mono so that it can run on Linux. A large part of the codebase 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is based on the System.Drawing library - therefore I am trying to use 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the gtk-dotnet bridge so that GTK can be used as a front end. However, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm having a hard time getting decent performance, and as far as I can 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tell, the problems seem to stem from the gtk-dotnet component.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've attached a sample application that just tries to flip two 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; System.Drawing.Bitmaps to a Gtk.DrawingArea, alternating them, in a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tight loop. It measures the time taken for each flip and prints it to the
</I>&gt;<i> console.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On Linux, I observe the following behaviour:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. My first approach was to try drawing directly to the screen 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (_drawDirect = true in the OnExposeEvent handler). The performance is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; good for roughly the first 100 or so loop iterations, but then it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; quickly degrades. It seems as though the system starts to run out of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; memory, which seems to be caused by creating a Graphics object using 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Gtk.DotNet.Graphics.FromDrawable inside the OnExposeEvent handler.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. My second approach was to try drawing to an intermediate Pixmap 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (_drawDirect = false in the OnExposeEvent handler), so as to avoid 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; having to create a Graphics object each time. In this case, the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; performance is constant over the entire duration of the loop. However, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the performance is pretty bad, taking roughly 1 second per flip, which 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is not acceptable for our purposes (and I'm running it on a reasonably
</I>&gt;<i> powerful laptop machine).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If someone with a solid understanding of Gtk/Gdk could look at my 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sample code and point out to me where I'm going wrong, it would be a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; huge help in getting this application running on Linux.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
