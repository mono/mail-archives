<PRE>As you may have noticed, along with mono 2.2p3 we recently released
gtk-sharp 2.12.7.  The .Net installers have been updated to the new
version and a new mono combined installer for the preview was also
released with 2.12.7.

At this point, we have branched for new development on trunk.  Any
subsequent bugfix and backporting releases for 2.12.x will come from
gtk-sharp-2-12-branch.

Note that trunk as yet still produces a 2.12 build.  This will likely
change over the holidays as I update the source dir to parse 2.14.
There are several efforts underway to add new functionality in 2.14.
Stephane has been working on gio-sharp. Christian is working on virtual
method generation.  I kicked off the trunk effort today with a de-gluing
patch for glib-sharp and pango-sharp.  One goal of the 2.14 release will
be to drastically minimize and eventually eliminate the glue we have
been lazily adding over the past decade.  This will help us deploy/build
more easily on multiple platforms.

We will be making every effort to maintain a working gtk-sharp on trunk
as we go along, so I would encourage developers running gtk+ 2.14
distributions to continue to track trunk and file bug reports liberally.
Those running 2.12 distros will need to switch to 2-12-branch.
