<PRE>You're right the effect only shows up if you have a large number of 
rows. But not storing the images as a pixbuf leads to a considerable 
performance improvement. I used my EAN13 class in a treeview that had 
about 10.000 rows. In earlier versions it was derived from 
CellRendererPixbuf and the load was awfully slow(about 30 seconds!) 
because Gtk+ renders not just the visible cells, but instead all of them.

That's why I tested the approach to subclass directly from CellRenderer 
and create the image in the render method using Cairo. And suddenly 
everything was 10 times faster(yes it was really that much a 
difference). BTW the CellRendererPixbuf uses cairo as well:

  cr = gdk_cairo_create (window);
 
  gdk_cairo_set_source_pixbuf (cr, pixbuf, pix_rect.x, pix_rect.y);
  gdk_cairo_rectangle (cr, &amp;draw_rect);
  cairo_fill (cr);

  cairo_destroy (cr);
