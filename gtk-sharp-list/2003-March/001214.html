I was feeling creative and slightly bored, so I put up a Gtk# wiki at
<A HREF="http://nullenvoid.com/gtksharp/wiki">http://nullenvoid.com/gtksharp/wiki</A> . The main motivation behind this
was to help keep track of what's going on in Gtk# development -- I have
been having a terrible time remembering issues that get raised on the
list, and I have much less time to hack these days anyway so the issues
don't stay clear in my mind.

It is not intended to replace the lists, bugzilla, or the Gtk# home
page, but to enhance them. I have been thinking a lot recently about how
important user input is for the future of Gtk# development, and this
seemed a good way to categorize general comments on Gtk# -- comments
that aren't quite feature requests and thus aren't entirely suitable for
bugzilla, or something that will get brought up on the mailing list and
then forgotten. It could also serve as sort of &quot;homepage breeding
ground&quot; -- I imagine really useful content would eventually migrate to
the Gtk# homepage.

I would encourage anyone who is interested to go to the wiki and add
their own input to it. Also, if you bring something up on the mailing
list that you want to help forgetful people like me remember, please put
it on the wiki as well.

Thanks much,
Rachel
