No, we currently track one lib (gtkhtml) from cvs because it hasn't
released yet for 2.0, and it's been a PITA.  There is no way that gtk#
cvs will ever track all its native libs cvs versions.  We are tracking
&quot;platform&quot; releases with the current target being GNOME/Gtk 2.0. There a
few outliers that are not officially in the platform yet and you can
find the current targeted version of those in the sources/README file. I
know this is suboptimal, and if the docs folks can find a way to better
doc this, great.

What exactly has to be done to what?  Gst#?  Last I heard from alp there
were some union parsing/generation issues with Gst, but I haven't been
able to get a chance to look at it yet.  I thought alp was already using
gst-sharp for platano, though.
