While I'm not a translator, I'd count that as a blessing rather than a
problem. :) It's always been a pain to setup &amp; maintain in my (limited)
experience of it.

&gt;<i> So... as far as I know, you are left creating your own solution for

The .NET way of doing culture-specific things is with a ResourceManager.
&gt;<i>From what I remember reading, it's not tied to strings alone but has a GetString() method that takes a 'name' and a CultureInfo object to retrieve localized strings from a &quot;resource&quot;.
</I>
I've been looking at this recently because the CultureInfo support in mono isn't complete yet, and I've been working locally on improving it.

In short, reading up on ResourceManager is a good idea - it looks like it provides a far nicer way of managing l10n than binding gettext would...

Regards,

Lee.
