The original thought was to categorize these code bits so that the
beginner (ie. me and others) could find what they are looking for

</I>Yes that would be great! there is sooooo much that is unexplained or
that is documented but in a way that is highly unaccessible for a novice
to GTK (or c# etc)

The pros of the repository would be that it would be really easy for
many people to contribute quickly

The con is that it is not directly tied into the GTK# documentation...
maybe a compromize could be found. for example a forum where sample code
could be posted in categories linked from the widget or event in the
gtk# doc or user comments linked in to the documentation (like php.net
allthough that quickly gets messy)
If a forum is needed or any other web/server/repos etc I'd be glad to
donate time and bandwidth to it :)=20
