<PRE>Christ, I just reread my response and realized how cranky it sounded. I
didn't even thank you for the patch. :(

So...

Thanks for the patch. :)

It is important when you are submitting patches that you try to make
only the changes that are necessary to accomplish your task.  Open
source maintainer time is a precious unrenewable resource, and one I in
particular seem to have less of lately than normal, even.  Reviewing
changes that don't add anything still requires effort to make sure they
don't break anything.

Your message with the post didn't indicate any reason for the OUTPUT
changes, and the ChangeLog entry just said you added it and used it, but
no indication as to why.  The only reason I could see to have such a
rule would be to make it easier to copy/paste a makefile into a new
namespace directory, but that doesn't justify changing every existing
makefile.

Anyway, sorry if my abrupt message offended. And thanks again for the
patch.

Mike
