<PRE>Hey guys,

        I have written a small widget that some people might find useful
	to learn Gtk#:

	Screenshot:

		<A HREF="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/tmp/Screenshot-Mlist5.png">http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/tmp/Screenshot-Mlist5.png</A>

	The widget is 307 lines of code currently, and the code contains
	a reader for Camel summaries (those used by Evolution).

* Introduction

	This is a list widget similar to what you have seen on the
	new Outlook screenshots.   Hopefully the code can be useful
	to people who might want to learn to write widgets from 
	scratch with Gtk#.

	The idea of the new layout in Outlook is very simple: most of
	the time the right side of your message display contains blank
	space, which is not used, and the list of messages is crammed
	down to a few lines above the current message view.

	My moving from the traditional view to the new view, you win
	a few lines:

	+------------------------+  +-------------+---------+
	| Sender   Time  Subject |  | Sender Time | Content |
	| Sender   Time  Subject |  | Subject     | Content |
	+------------------------+  +-------------+ Content |
	| Content	         |  | Sender Time | Content |
	| Content	         |  | Subject     | Content |
	| Content	         |  | Sender Time | Content |
	| Content	         |  | Subject     | Content |
        +------------------------+  +-------------+---------+

        The graphic does not do justice to the real space savings, but
	you get the idea.  

* The widget

	The widget supports grouping, and it is not very general, it
	is currently designed to just render this particular kind of
	data. 

	The widget communicates with the data through an interface:

	interface IDataProvider {
		object GetData (int row, Datum col);
		int    Rows { get; }
	}

	The implementor of this interface acts as the model for the
	widget, the widget implements the view.  The model will be
	called back to retrieve information.

	The widget takes firve arguments:

	public Mlist (IDataProvider provider, Datum group_col, 
		      Datum group_label, Datum sort_col, 
		      bool  invert_sort)

	The first is the model provider, which should return data on
	demand, and the number of rows on it.  The `group_col'
	is the column queried to perform groupings, you can choose any
	grouping style you want with this function.

	The actual labels rendered for the group should be provided by
	the `group_label' column on the model.  You can for example
	group by day, but you might want the label to show information
	with labels like `Today', `Yesterday', `Last week'.  Ideally
	the widget is initialized and constructed in a way that the
	columns make sense.

	The sort_col is the column used to sort the elements inside a
	group,and the invert_sort operation is used to tell whether
	the sorting order should be reverted.

	A typical use is:

	Mlist list = new Mlist (
		p, Datum.GroupTime, Datum.Label_GroupTime, Datum.Time,
		true);

	This will group by time, will use a special label for grouping
	by time, and will sort by the time field.   

* Using it.

	To compile use the `make' command, you will need a recent
	version of Gtk# (CVS at the time of this writing), the default
	test program will load a file in the current directory called
	`mbox.ev-summary' which is a Camel summary file for mbox files
	(I took this from my Evolution setup).

	You can provide your own model, but using the default, and
	using the Evolution code allows you to see the data in all its
	beauty.
