Well, if &quot;probing&quot; is the only reason you want to get rid of exceptions,
then maybe we should create a API specifically for &quot;probing&quot;.  (Is that
the only reason to NOT use exceptions?)

For stuff like the &quot;End of File&quot;, these things are already &quot;returned&quot;.
(Instead of being thrown.  It is only the &quot;unusual&quot; errors that
are being thrown.)

Alternatively, I could create 2 different implementation of
System.IO.Stream (and other classes).  One would use exceptions and
the other wouldn't.

Or, I could make one implementation.  But you could configure how
the class reports errors.

What does everyone think about that????


See ya
