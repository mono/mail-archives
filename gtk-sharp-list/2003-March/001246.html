<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Well, if &quot;probing&quot; is the only reason you want to get rid of exceptions,
</I>&gt;<i> then maybe we should create a API specifically for &quot;probing&quot;.  (Is that
</I>&gt;<i> the only reason to NOT use exceptions?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For stuff like the &quot;End of File&quot;, these things are already &quot;returned&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> (Instead of being thrown.  It is only the &quot;unusual&quot; errors that
</I>&gt;<i> are being thrown.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Alternatively, I could create 2 different implementation of
</I>&gt;<i> System.IO.Stream (and other classes).  One would use exceptions and
</I>&gt;<i> the other wouldn't.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or, I could make one implementation.  But you could configure how
</I>&gt;<i> the class reports errors.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What does everyone think about that????
</I>
Remember one thing: exceptions are very expensive to create, to throw
and to catch, CPU-wise.  Very expensive. 

When you are building a file manager, you will need all the speed tricks
that you can to avoid pissing off people for unresponsive call.  That is
why file managers become ugly: they have to pull every possible trick to
avoid blocking, to get the list of files as quickly as possible, to
avoid hitting the disk twice, and so on.

&gt;<i>From a pure computer-science perspective, yes, throwing exceptions might
</I>be nice, but it is not practical.  If you want to have an exception
based API, you can always have a wrapper to do it.  But if you use
exceptions as the foundation, you can not efficiently implement the
other mode.

Miguel.
