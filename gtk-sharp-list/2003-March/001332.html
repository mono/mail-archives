Maybe if I know how `exactly` such a C# binding is created I can help
with updating it and/or writing documentation for it. I, however, don't
have any experience with Gstreamer at this moment (I wil going to learn
how to use it, thats for sure). I have one year experience with .NET and
C# and multiple years with GNOME and GTK+ development.

Because I am talking about the CVS-version of gtk-sharp, imho it should
work with the latest version of GStreamer in CVS... or it should be
documented very good that it only works with a specific version of
GStreamer :).. but instead of wining about that I am willing to help..I
just need to be told what exactly has to be done.
