The pkgconfig file is supposed to use the csc-like switches. If the pnet
compiler doesn't support that, send a bug report to them.

Note that if your program doesn't use types from an assembly,
the assembly is not bound by the compiler, so I think this point is
mostly moot (you just get a tiny slowdown during compilation).
That said, I think we should reduce the number of assemblies.
The reasons are:
*) less clutter
*) each assembly has a fixed overhead, the less are loaded in a program,
the better

One trivial example is atk-sharp: this is a separate assembly
that is linked to gtk-sharp and as such is always loaded: there is no
point in having it as a separate assembly.
Some of the others assemblies are in the same positions: what are the
chances gdk-sharp is used without gtk-sharp? I'd say quite small.

I personally would prefer something like:

	glib-sharp

	gtk-sharp (includes also gdk-sharp, pango-sharp and atk-sharp)

	gnome-sharp (includes also art-sharp and rsvg)

Note that, unlike with C libraries, having your app use gnome-sharp,
would not make the runtime load also the rsvg shared library,
unless you use the feature.

&gt;<i> &gt; Since pkg-config is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; primarily targetted at C projects, maybe we need to be considering
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cooking a different solution that works better for the C# realm?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IMO, I think we need our own pkgconfig flag.  Maybe an --assemblies
</I>&gt;<i> flag.  And then we'd do stuff like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     pkg-config --assemblies gnome-sharp
</I>
pkg-config already supports such a feature, though it doesn't
do variable substituion on it. Add:
assemblies=/ref:gtk-sharp /ref:gnome-sharp
to a .pc file and the issue:
	pkg-config --variable=assemblies filename.pc
