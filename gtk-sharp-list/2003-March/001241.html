First you mentioned that you were told that &quot;gda-sharp.dll&quot; and
&quot;gnomedb-sharp.dll&quot; would not be created or installed.  That's
not a huge problem.  (Unless you want to use GDA or GnomeDB.)
So, basically, don't worry about this for now.

But anyways....

It sounds like you are trying to install Gtk# (a.k.a. gtk-sharp)
from the source code. (There are other ways to install it.  With
an RPM.  With a DEB.  Etc.  But, for the purposes of this e-mail,
I'll just discuss installing it from the source code.)

I'm assuming that you got the latest source code release for
Gtk#.  I.e., you got the file called:

    gtk-sharp-0.8.tar.gz

I'm also assuming you know how to unpack it.

Now, when you install Gtk# from the source code, there are 3
commands you should to type:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    make
    make install

Well, that is assuming that none of these steps gave you
errors.

Your problem with not being able to find &quot;libgtksharpglue.so&quot;
sounds like you may have not have run &quot;make install&quot;?  (Is
this the case?  Did you run &quot;make install&quot;?)

Or else, there may have been errors in creating &quot;libgtksharpglue.so&quot;
when you were running &quot;make&quot;.  Where there are errors?  And if
so, what were they?  (Copy any errors into the e-mail.)

Hope that helps.


See ya
