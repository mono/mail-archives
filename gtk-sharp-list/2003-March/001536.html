No point in installing the script with a .pl suffix.

#!/usr/bin/perl at the start of the script means it will be interpreted
by perl regardless of the file extension.

pkg-config isn't suitable for this kind of use. We grilled this issue to
death on #mono a few months ago; the consensus is that the current setup
will have to suffice until the Global Assembly Cache is implemented.

We shouldn't ship a 1.0 version of either Mono or Gtk# with
architecture-independent dll files in /usr/lib either, for example. But
it's an acceptable compromise until the GAC is done. 

The GAC is a fairly complex suite of tools to manage .NET assembly
versioning and installation. Nevertheless, it should be straightforward
to build a simple GAC that installs and indexes assemblies somewhere in
/usr/share (the exact location should be further discussed, based on
LSB/FHS policy). Until this is done, it would be best to avoid the
introduction of ephemeral workarounds for a problem that will soon have
a proper solution.
