It depends what's trying to be created here.
To go into the tutorial, you need some decent text explaining the code
as well as some C#.

However, I think there's probably still a need for a 'Gtk# code
snippets' repository... It could then be further categorised into things
like really useful classes, or just small snippets demonstrating how to
use a class. I don't think any such thing currently exists for Gtk#
outside of the 'sample' directory on cvs.

At the moment, some of the API docs contain tiny samples to demonstrate
how to create a class in its typical use case.

Maybe code snippets that are obviously related to certain widgets can be
linked in to the relevant widget's API doc page. Patrick, would that
satisfy the need for snippets, or are you still in favour of growing a 
big repository of random examples?

My main reason for suggesting tying of examples/snippets to the API docs
is because then everything remains &quot;integrated&quot; so that if a new Gtk#
programmer looks for the docs, they find everything they need...

Regards,

Lee.
