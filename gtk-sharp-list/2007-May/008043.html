That's right, but I can also add after reviewing what I did with Eskil that this problem now
*only* occurs from within the timer. I have yet to verify whether the crash occurs when I remove
the threading stuff (actually I did it late last night and can't remember the outcome), but I
think this might be directly related to timers even though they should be fully kosher.

At least now I can release a fully working app that opens the dialog immediately when a problem is
detected - not the best solution but at least now I'm only on yellow alert. :-)

Many thanks to all that replied, I will do that other test I mentioned and post an updated test
program sometime this weekend.
