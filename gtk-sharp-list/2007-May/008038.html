<PRE>Hi everyone, hope you are all well.

I'm still getting that problem where my application freezes when I 
try to show a dialog at startup. I've now verified this behaviour on 
several other physical machines. It's driving me around the twist 
working on this great GUI that most people can't start.

I did get one reply to my test app submission, however unfortunately 
that suggestion didn't help in the long run, only temporarily (thanks 
anyway Eskil). Other than that, I don't even know whether the 
behaviour was replicated by anyone. Hint hint :-( .

I can't for the life of me understand how this can happen. If I can't 
open a dialog from a timer thread well after the window opens, when 
can I open one? At any point from within the program I can call the 
same method and successfully open a dialog box on any machine. The 
'check your config' dialog only works for me and me alone. I can't 
see any difference between the two situations, and only *my* computer 
believes me. :-D

Some invisible line is being crossed, and I really need to know what 
it is. I've gone back to stuffing around with different versions of 
Gtk#, order of operations during startup and so on (cause I just 
couldn't get enough last time). Here's my current order of operations 
for starting Gtk#:

         // Initialise the threads.
                 if (!GLib.Thread.Supported) GLib.Thread.Init();
                 Gdk.Threads.Init();
                 Gdk.Threads.Enter();

                 // Start the 'application'.
                 Application.Init();

                 // Create the window.
                 window = new GtkWindow();

                 // Initialise display contents.
                 window.initialise();

                 // Display the window.
                 window.ShowAll();

                 // Start the timer.
                 GLib.Timeout.Add(100, new 
GLib.TimeoutHandler(window.timerTick));

                 // Start Gdk#.
                 Application.Run();

I've pushed this code as far into my app as it will go, just to be 
sure that EVERYTHING is initialised before the GUI. Regardless, it is 
_after_ all this that the dialog opens and the app freezes. Once 
again, if my configuration file is intact, I can open other dialogs 
without problems during normal operation of the program. All that's 
involved in either case is a one line call to the same method passing 
only a string to display as a message.

I am ready to submit the entire app to anyone who will test it for 
me. I *have* to know what is going on here. I will be (even more) 
astoundingly grateful to anyone who can help me with this.

Thanks,

Aaron.
