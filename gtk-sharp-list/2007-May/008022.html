<PRE>I currently have a design in which I am using a TreeCellDataFunc to render 
values of a class that I am storing in a TreeStore to a several editable 
columns in a TreeView. 
This worked great until I added a button that sets all the values back to 
defaults.  The source class gets updated, but the TreeView is not updated 
to reflect the changes until I move the mouse over it.
 
So, my problem is that I can&#8217;t seem to find a list of events that trigger 
the TreeCellDataFunc to run.  It seems that pointing the cursor at the 
TreeView is an event which makes it run, but is seems like there must be a 
way that I can force it to run from the code that is activated by my 
Defaults button. 

Also, it would be ideal if I could control when the TreeCellDataFunc runs 
so that I can run it after I first populate the source class, then after 
that only when I change the data from within my application.  I am afraid 
it will take a bunch of overhead to run the fairly complex code within the 
TreeCellDataFunc whenever the user pans past the TreeView with the mouse. 
Is there any way to control which events trigger the TreeCellDataFunc to 
run.

I assume this is not a difficult thing, but could not figure out how to do 
it!

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks,
Michael
