<PRE>Hey,

&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;<i> I compiled gapi-fixup and codegen using csc from dotnet 3.5 (I can't 
</I>&gt;<i> have 1 or 1.1, I'm using vista and there is no 64bit dotnet 1 or 1.1). 
</I>&gt;<i> Then I wrote those makefiles generating .cs using gapi-fixup and codegen 
</I>&gt;<i> in the same way as 2.12's makefiles and compilling *glue.dll files (I 
</I>&gt;<i> can't get, why you are creating another platform specific stuff, why 
</I>&gt;<i> don't you wrap it in .NET? This is what I don't like on GtkSharp and 
</I>&gt;<i> everything around it - million of platform dependend C wrappers in C). I 
</I>&gt;<i> have glue files and cs files. But I am unable to compile them. Always 
</I>&gt;<i> multiple definitions of blablabla or unknown type blablabla.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So is 64bit version of GtkSharp going to be release in the near future? 
</I>&gt;<i> Is it worth waiting?
</I>
The tone you've taken in your emails is very negative, and it's not
constructive in the least.

The work has been done with respect to Gtk# on Windows, Medsphere
excluded, has been mostly a volunteer effort.  If there's something that
hasn't yet been done (for instance Win64 support), it's because no one
is currently interested enough to invest the time.  And trust me when I
say that getting installers and builds working with Win64 is not
trivial.

Bottom line is -- until someone steps up to implement it because they're
interested, or they're really nice, you can either pay someone to do it,
or work on it yourself.  If you write emails in a polite tone, people
might even be willing to help out.

Best,

-Brad
