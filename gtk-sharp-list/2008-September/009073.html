Not sure what the issue with not being able to reopen it was.  If you
were logged in, you should have been able to.

I just added a comment on the bug.  I talked to Cody Russell last week
and he is in agreement that it is problematic for the win32 build to
require a different function call for that functionality than on linux.
He has to convince Tor of that, and said he would take it back up with
him.

I left the bug resolved|invalid for now, because I still believe this is
an upstream bug in gtk+.
