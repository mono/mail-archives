Hello, I've been looking for a WebBrowser-like component for Mono. There's
not much information about Gecko# that I've been able to find. I have been
using System.Windows.Forms for everything, but if I can find a GOOD solution
to this problem, I would gladly re-write all my code for Gtk#.

This stems from needing a reporting solution for .NET that is cross-platform
(so Crystal is out...besides, I'd prefer open-source anyways) and has a
report designer. This way, the reports that I create could be modified by
the end user to suit their needs. I would also need it to accept a custom
DataSet/DataTable, as my application can connect to multiple database
engines. After searching for days, the only thing I could think of was using
HTML. The only problem is, the Windows .NET version of WebBrowser (IE) sucks
so bad. When it comes to printing, it gives you no control what-so-ever. I
can't even change the headers/footers and page orientation without using COM
Interop or hacking the registry....neither of which is cross-platform.

So does anyone have any recommendations for a reporting solution...or
worst-case, a cross-platform HTML component? Thanks for your help.
