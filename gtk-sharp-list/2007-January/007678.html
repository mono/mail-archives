Short answer:

Things should start looking nicer in bugzilla starting next week.

Longer answer:

We had to put Gtk# into a holding pattern for a while so I could help
with the winforms implementation.  Now that we've shipped mono 1.2, I'll
be rotating back onto &quot;almost full-time&quot; status on Gtk#.  First order of
business is to do some triaging and get the bug count down.  I'll also
be publishing a development plan on the Wiki, hopefully next week, which
will give some indication where the short and longer term focus will
lie.

Thanks for everyone's patience while we took a big step forward for mono
with the winforms toolkit.
