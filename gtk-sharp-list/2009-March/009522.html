</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Yes, this rule applies to the model as well. The model can only be 
updated from the Gtk thread.
&gt;<i> 2. In connection with question one, are there any extra steps I need to take
</I>&gt;<i> to notify the GTK main loop?  I've looked through the ListStore methods and
</I>&gt;<i> I'm seeing methods like 'EmitRowChanged', etc. These would seem to imply
</I>&gt;<i> that the GTK main loop won't notice these changes...and maybe that my queue
</I>&gt;<i> thread can change the model, but I'm not sure.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>No, these methods in ListStore shall not be called directly. They are 
members of GtkTreeModel, but as we generate that class as a .net 
interface, we cannot place the method code in the interface itself.
&gt;<i> 3. I want to be able to perform actions based on a unique ID in my data
</I>&gt;<i> rows, remove them, update them, etc. What methods/approaches are good for
</I>&gt;<i> this with GTK, both from the user side (e.g. capturing the row that the user
</I>&gt;<i> clicked on), or from the program side (e.g. remove row with unique ID 'x')?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>In general it is always a very bad idea to keep the data in two places 
in memory; e. g. in an array your program uses and in the ListStore. If 
you have to store your row data in another internal data structure and 
not just in the ListStore, you can write a custom TreeModel:
