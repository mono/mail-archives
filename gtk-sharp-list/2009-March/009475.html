<PRE>Hi everyone,
 
I am just in the middle of my first gtk# project and I have a problem
with not being able to click a button after a dialog has been shown. The
application is for touchscreen devices and clicking a button in the main
application opens up a fullscreen keyboard dialog which has individual
Done and Cancel reponse buttons. The buttons in the main screen are
shown in a table and the upper right button - let me call it &quot;Enter
Date&quot; - is located just beneath the keyboard dialog &lt;Done&gt; button. When
I now select &lt;Done&gt; in my keyboard dialog it will close and my pointer
is located in the middle of the &quot;Enter Date&quot; button. Clicking this
button has no effect until I move the pointer outside the button and
then back. If you receive my attached screenshot you can see the yellow
button &quot;Pflegedienstleitung&quot; in the background - this can not be clicked
when I click the red &quot;Abbruch&quot; button.
I have looked around for this problem in gtk# but did not find any
references. However, there are quite a few bugs filed for gtk+ that are
related or show a similar behaviour (these are bugs #22930 and #56070
and #30822). This bug seems to have been fixed in gtk+ last year
(according to <A HREF="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gtk+2.0/+bug/22930">https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gtk+2.0/+bug/22930</A>).
 
Can anyone confirm this behaviour or suggest a solution for gtk#? So far
I have tested this on Windows XP with the Mono 2.2 installation
including tht gtk-sharp.dll Version 2.12.0.0.
 
Regards,
 
Philip Wobst
