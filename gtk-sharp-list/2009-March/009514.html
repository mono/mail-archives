Yup, the thing is that the GTK# project templates are included in the
GTK# designer addin, which doesn't currently work on the Mac, since
the Mac GTK+ port is relatively immature and is missing features we
need for the designer. The designer doesn't support VB yet, so the VB
GTK# templates are in the VB addin.

There's a problem with the Mac Mono/MD installer, in that it doesn't
set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH to include the Mono framework pc files (MD
doesn't actually use pkg-config, it just tries to look in the right
places and parse the .pc files). That said, if you've set the path
yourself, it should be working.

After MD 2.0 beta 1, I improved MD's pkg-config detection, so it
correctly picks up GTK# (and other Mono libraries) and offers them in
the edit references dialog.

&gt;<i> Thanks in advance!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS I tried building Mono 1.9.3 (2.0 beta 2.0) but it gives me an error: &quot;You
</I>&gt;<i> need to install update-desktop-database&quot;, so I can't tell if that release

To build for Mac, you have to pass some extra flags. The Mac profile does this:

Alternatively, I built a MD Mac app (on linux) from the 2.0 branch a
few hours ago, for testing. You're welcome to try it:

MD's actually capable of building itself on Mac now, without any
makefiles or autotools. Just use the DebugMac configuration, which
will exclude the addins that don't work or aren't needed on Mac.
