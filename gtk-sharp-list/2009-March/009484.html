Hi Chris,

We wanted to implement MDI feature in our application.
So what we did is everytime when the user is clicking on new window button
we are launching a dialog window.
We are using transientfor property to make this window lie on parent window.

We were planning to use dialog windows as MDI Workaround as they are giving
the functionality like minimizing to the parent window in Windows platform.

In windows for these separate windows no taskbar button is coming. When
minimized, the dialog windows happens to minimize to the parent window.(I
wrongly stated the minimized single icon in the parent window as taskbar
button, Sorry for that..)

But in case of linux even after using the transientfor property the windows
are minimizing to the task bar and separate taskbar buttons are coming for
each window.(seems like transentfor property is not working there)



//code
 public partial class ModuleWindow : Gtk.Window
    {
        public delegate void MyWindowState(object sender,
Gtk.ConfigureEventArgs args);
        public event MyWindowState MyWindowStateEvent;
        private Gtk.ScrolledWindow moduleScrolledWindow;
        private Gtk.Viewport moduleWindowViewport;
       

        public ModuleWindow(): base(Gtk.WindowType.Toplevel)
        {
            this.DeleteEvent += new
Gtk.DeleteEventHandler(this.OnDeleteEvent);
            this.Title = &quot;Module Window&quot;;       

          

            this.TransientFor = Main.MainWindow;// where MainWindow is the
parent window.
		
		// changed this code to get the windows minimized to parent.

            //this.Parent = Main.MainWindow;
            //this.ParentWindow = Main.MainWindow.GdkWindow;

            moduleScrolledWindow = new Gtk.ScrolledWindow();
            this.Add(moduleScrolledWindow);

            moduleWindowViewport = new Gtk.Viewport();
            moduleScrolledWindow.Add(moduleWindowViewport);
            
            this.DestroyWithParent = true;

            this.WindowStateEvent += new
Gtk.WindowStateEventHandler(ModuleWindow_WindowStateEvent);
            this.ConfigureEvent += new
Gtk.ConfigureEventHandler(ModuleWindow_ConfigureEvent);
            
            InitializeModuleWindow();
           
        }

	}

Another thing we are implementing here is we are restricting these diaog
windows inside a frame. We are pushing back the windows when it is going
outside the frame.
We are using frame.allocation for getting the postion and we are moving back
using window.move.

Is  there any other workaround for this? 

I want to tile windows(horizontally and vertically) inside this frame. Now
do I need to resize each dialog window and move them to corresponding
positions or any other go?

Any help will be appreciated.

Thanks a lot!!!

Libin

I'm not sure what you mean by this.  Did you expect the parent window to
have its own taskbar of children or something?

</I>&gt;<i> And In case of linux every window was having a separate taskbar button 
</I>&gt;<i> in the taskbar itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the problem in linux is the OS is considering every new window

</I>
The GNOME panel is seeing every window as a window.  Usually SkipTaskbarHint
is enough to make it not show up in the taskbar.  You might have to subclass
Dialog instead of Window to get this behavior.

Perhaps you could back up a bit and explain the overall goal here?
Maybe there is another approach you have not thought of.
