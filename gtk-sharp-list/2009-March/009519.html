<PRE>Hi!

I have a question which I thought would be easy to answer but till now I
have not found a satisfactory answer. I want to embed a video inside a
gtk# app. The code for embedding this should be as easy as possible and
I do not have much requirements for it.
I just want to be able to play ogg files and play, pause and seek in
them.

I looked for a gtk# widget for something like this but had no luck in
finding one. The simplest code I could find was muxine.c from the xine
lib for plain X11 which I don't yet know how to port and for gstreamer
the simplest solution I could find takes 2500 locs.

So I would be happy for any suggestions for a simple solution.

Thanks a lot, Fabian

</PRE>
