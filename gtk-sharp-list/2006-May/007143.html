<PRE>Ahh interesting. I was going by example since I found a few in there
that use private implementations with .custom files that are like that
as well, where instead of updating the parameter name, it was hiding and
doing it manually (a few of them are in my notebook if you want them).

Hehe, looks like I can update my own bindings now. :-) Learn something
everyday.
