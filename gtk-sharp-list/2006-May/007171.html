Yeah, those will be following soon. I was testing three implementations
of hierarchical notification system and four cases of different TreeView
implementations.

I would really like to find THE right way before updating svn with new
TreeView. Case I'm most interested here is completely live treeview,
with live editing just as much as live updates trough all.

</I>&gt;<i> of [WidgetName]. Maybe Bound[WidgetName] would work better? Ideally it

Second thing you mention is my original plan. First thing.... It was
just that project originally started with this naming. And as long as it
is constricted to be outside of gtk# (meaning test case as it is now) I
don't see a problem. If I wouldn't have such crazy last weeks I would
probably already be done with complete thing, but as it looks this
nuthouse will continue for two weeks more. For that time my time is very
limited to night hacking.

But if you feel there is something to add or idea, you can either post
idea here or leave me message on irc on #monodev (m). I'm mostly not
there but I'll get the message. Same goes for anyone that thinks he has
something to add

&gt;<i> I'm not sure that Gtk.Bondage is really a good name for the namespace...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Well, if you read the readme I think you know why it is good :) (if MS
named their implementation bindings then this can only qualify for ...)
But hopefully it will go down to mainstream gtk namespace, and will be
mentioned as bondage in jokes only:)
