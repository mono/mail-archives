As far as 2.0 dependencies go, we have already added the dependency in
trunk, so we can use features like [UnmanagedFunctionPointer].  Efforts
to move to generic collections can proceed in trunk.

There will also hopefully be significant deprecation cleanup in trunk
before 3.0, so anyone who wants to contribute to that effort is welcome
to do so.  Most of it will be automatic because the native API is
removing them, but we can probably remove most of the workaround and
stability deprecations as well.

Perhaps you were looking for these changes to be done in 2.12?  We could
not do that and maintain our stability guarantee or provide continued
support on mono's 1.1 profile, of course.
