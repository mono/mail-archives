<PRE>[DOH] Sorry Francesco replied to you instead of the list the first time. 
[/DOH]
I understand your frustration but try to remember that this is all open 
source and they don't have tons of money to higher the workforce that 
Microsoft has. I have started work on a rich text editor, however I 
don't have a lot of spare time to work on it. If you find that you can't 
find anyone else who has a rich text editor that you like maybe we can 
see if you want to help me.

Have you thought about using WebKit # to get rich text via html? It's 
just a thought I have had from time to time.

I hope you can find what you are looking for but Gtk# has only been 
around for a short time, maybe something C++ would do what you need?

Good luck to ya.
