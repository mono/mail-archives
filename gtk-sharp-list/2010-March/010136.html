Thanks Christian for your reply and the source code. 

I agree that a build-in binding support for Gtk# would be great.

I've been working at my job with MS tools and controls by DevExpress for
some years now and I decided to work on some personal projects with
MonoDevelop/Gtk#. My first impression is that Gtk# alone is light-years far
from being considered as a RAD tool for large or complex applications. 

On the other hand, I don't believe that someday Gtk# will include all the
nice features like those proprietary controls in MS.NET world, give. I guess
due to Gtk# is attached to gtk+ laconic philosophy.

So these days, after I played a bit with Gtk# I decided to make a layer over
Gtk# with some custom widgets that will include all these features that I
miss most from my experience with DevExpress controls.

Any advice on this? Is there any similar open source project? I would love
to participate and not to rediscover the wheel.
