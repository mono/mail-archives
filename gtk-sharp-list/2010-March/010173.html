Specific questions are easier to answer.

But one overlooked resource is the &quot;sample&quot; directory of the gtk-sharp
source code.  This contains numerous examples of how to use given
widget, and the examples are specific enough not to be obfuscated by
other application stuff.

svn co <A HREF="http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/trunk/gtk-sharp">http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/trunk/gtk-sharp</A> gtk-sharp
cd gtk-sharp/sample

And maybe &lt;<A HREF="http://nemerle.org/Gtk_text_editor">http://nemerle.org/Gtk_text_editor</A>&gt; is worth a look.
