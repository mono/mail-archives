    Hi all. I'm trying to build a GTK# installer which uses GTK+ 2.16 instead
of 2.12. As stated in the README in the directory win32-installers of the
Mono tree, to do this I need to:
    1. Run &quot;make win32-installer&quot; in the branch of GTK# 2.12; 
    2. Move the resulting *.msm files back to win32-installers to create my
installer (by replacing the GTK+ libraries with their 2.16 versions).
    Here comes the problem: as the procedure requires WiX, which doesn't run
in Linux, obviously I need to use Windows. For this purpose I tried to use
Cygwin, which, however, fails at the &quot;configure&quot; stage with &quot;C compiler
cannot create executables&quot;. I found in the Internet that tens of people have
had this issue but none of their solutions worked for me. Therefore, I'd
like to ask the following:
    1. Is there an alternative to Cygwin which I can use?
    2. If not, is it possible to get the *.msm files from somewhere else,
already built? Or could somebody with a working Cygwin configuration be so
kind as to build them for me?
