Welcome to mono. I never used GTK before using mono and most of the
documentation out there seems  basically non helpful for the c# bindings.
Mono's basic GTK documentation can be found here:
<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/docs/">http://www.go-mono.com/docs/</A>  where you click on gnome libraries then Gtk.

Anyway there are probably two existing widgets which might suit your needs:
input and textview. Gtk.Entry does what you think it would do. It allows for
the user to input some text like a username or password or something.

The textview is more complicated and allows for some really nifty text
manipulation using pango. If you want your user to be manipulating the text,
this is probably what you want. Pango can also be tricky to figure out so
I'd have to know more specifically what you want to do to give you a good
example.

So I would recommend that you go to that link up above and click on
gnome-libraries then click on the 'entry class' and the 'textview class'.
Both of them have simple usage examples. If you have more questions after
that I'll try to help as best I can.
