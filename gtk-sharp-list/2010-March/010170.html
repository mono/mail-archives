<PRE>
My situation is this:
I am attending a programming class at my local collage in C#, and I do of
course want to use Open Source to do this since I believe that is where my
future lies. But I'm having trouble with the easiest of things when it comes
to gtk# since it is not at all like WinForms. And since there seems to be no
graphical designer for WinForms in MonoDevelop I'm pritty much bound to use
gtk#. I have nothing against gtk#, it is only that I don't know it and
neither does my teacher. 
Searching around the net I'm having a really hard time wrapping my head
around the subject, understandably the library is not covered a lot since
it's not the most popular.

Anyhow, what I'm basicly looking for is help around what I should use
instead of the WinForms textbox and how it works. As an extension to that I
would gladly accept any beginners guide to gtk#.

Have a great day everyone who had the curtsey to read all the way here!
