Yep.

</I>
For nicer widgets than average check out
&lt;<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/holly-gtk-widgets/">http://code.google.com/p/holly-gtk-widgets/</A>&gt;  It doesn't receive much
love, but these are very nice widgets and easier to use in many cases
than the default ones.

&gt;<i> Any advice on this? Is there any similar open source project? I would love
</I>&gt;<i> to participate and not to rediscover the wheel.
</I>
For data binding as a third-party package there has been considerable
work done at &lt;<A HREF="http://gtk-databind.sourceforge.net/">http://gtk-databind.sourceforge.net/</A>&gt; and the
documentation is unusually good.

Also, IMO, just some documentation / BLOB-posts about doing things like
implementing a TreeModel in Gtk# would be very useful.  There is far to
much go-look-at-the-C-code.  Or if these documents exist make sure they
get linked from the Gtk# site FAQ/docs.
