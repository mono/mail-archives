<PRE>I'm going to dispense with the self-flagellation for how slow the
progress has been lately and skip right to the good news:

Before everyone runs off and starts implementing their favorite
productivity applications in C# on linux, let me bleed a little air out
of your balloons.  The delete event still segfaults.  The entirety of
validated usefulness of Gtk# on linux is displayed in that screenshot. 
If you proceed to start building cutting edge GUI applications with
Gtk#, expect a lot of frustration in your immediate future.

Elsewhere on the good news front, though, the code generator now
compiles on mint on linux.  It does not run to completion yet, but I
don't think that is very far off, especially the way that mint/mono have
been maturing lately. I'm hoping to be developing Gtk# completely on
linux within the month, and will keep spamming bugzilla with my build
failure bug of the day until that happens.  

If you simply must see Gtk# Hello World running on a linux box near you,
you will need to compile the project on win32 and copy all the dll/exe's
over to linux.  Also, the DllImports are still referencing the libg*-1.3
dynamic libs, although that will be changing here as soon as I make time
to download the 2.0 tarballs.  Next on my list.  

Mike
