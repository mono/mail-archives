</I>I'll second that with glade.  I have a little application that I have to
code the layout on part of it because of the flexibility I need and the code
can get a little ugly.  If you have a pretty static interface then you
should always use glade.  What's nice about GTK is that you can do most of
the interface in Glade and in the parts you need the extra flexbility
required by hand coding you just leave that part blank and pack in your
custom stuff.

That might be confusing but it's pretty simple as I'm a pretty big noob
myself.  To start my journey I started by looking at an application called
monotheka (<A HREF="http://monotheka.mdk.org.pl/">http://monotheka.mdk.org.pl/</A>).  It's a simple application and it
used sqlite so it was a good starting point for me.  If you get the source
you'll see how the author set up his glade stuff.  My application is still
too early to start showing it as an example : ) (plus I'm learning .net and
GTK# at the same time, so I don't feel confident enough on my coding
technique).
