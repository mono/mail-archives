<PRE>Hey again.

Sorry for asking so many questions, but I just want to have a few issues clear.

I decided that I'd like to use Gtk.Databox *in* my C# application. I
guess that leaves me no other option than to create binding for it
(right? please correct me if I'm wrong).

Question - if I want to bind Gtk.Databox to C#, do I have to use the
GAPI parser? is there any other way (maybe even a more &quot;manual&quot; way,
that will take longer but I would understand what I'm doing)?

If I have to use the GAPI parser, what basically should I do to make
it work? use the fix-up tool? Edit the C code of Gtk.Databox? Any
hints here?

I could send the problematic C code so you could make gapi-parser
better, but I pretty much want to get this working as fast as I can,
so I don't want to rely on fixes to the GAPI parser.

It's pretty much my first coding project that could interest others,
so I hope that after the initial release I could get some feedback and
make it better, but I'm pretty much just looking for someone to show
me the road so I can start working on it...

Thanks again,
and sorry for my English and the amount of questions.

Yo'av.
