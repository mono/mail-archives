<PRE>After trying to wrap a library using the GAPI parser, I realized that in
one of the GObject wrappers all the functions are wrapped except one,
which has got a prototype like this:

void f_do_barnacle_destroy_deep_barnacle_gnode(GNode** node);

After looking into the API xml file that was generated by the GAPI
parser, I can see that the function was found by it, as you can see
here:

[...]
&lt;method name=&quot;DestroyDeepBarnacleGnode&quot;
cname=&quot;f_do_barnacle_destroy_deep_barnacle_gnode&quot; shared=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
  &lt;return-type type=&quot;void&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;parameters&gt;
    &lt;parameter type=&quot;GNode**&quot; name=&quot;node&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/parameters&gt;
&lt;/method&gt;
[...]

So I thinked about the problem was a missing included api when
generating the code (not in the parsing) but, after reviewing that it
seems that all apis are included, I decided to look into the
documentation and the source code of Gtk# and I found an interesting
thing: as there are C# wrappers for some GLib structs as GList or GSList
(Glib.List and Glib.SList classes), it seems that a wrapper for the
GNode Glib struct is not implemented yet into Gtk#.

My question is... is this true? There's not a wrapper for GNode yet? In
case of this to be true... How can I wrap a library which contains
functions using GNodes? Would be a good idea trying to implement a GNode
C# wrapper by myself or it's a better way to achieve this problem?

Thanks.

Mario.
