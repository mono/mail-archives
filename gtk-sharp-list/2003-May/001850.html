take a look at monotalk object browser, you could checkout monotalk from
mono cvs as module monotalk

</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone of you know of sth. that could be interesting for me???
</I>
I was looking for such library some time ago, but I didn't find any. My
plan was to modify monodis to make it more useful for such task.

Cheers
