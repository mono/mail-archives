Ah. I see now. I was initially confused about how PtrToString worked. I
figured that since it worked on const strings, it didn't involve a free,
but I wasn't sure if it was performing a copy operation as well. For
some reason I was under the impression it just referred back to the
original string without ever freeing it. Now having checked MSDN, I see
it does, which means we can just free the pointer like you say.

Ok, that's easy enough to do. I should be able to have that ready and
committed tonight.
