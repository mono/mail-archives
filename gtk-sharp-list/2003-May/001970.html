Surely there are not 162 instances of const char * returns.  It seems to
me like the majority of string returns in gtk are owned by the caller. 
We should only be changing the DllImports for those that aren't owned by
us.

So that is going to require an audit of those API calls and some tagging
in the XML. Otherwise, we are going to leak all the owned strings. It
should be a pretty small change to the generator to handle a tag like
that.

If you have the time, great.  This will most likely be isolated to
Method.cs, and I don't think I've changed it much, if at all.

Mike
