<PRE>Hello Lee,

&gt;<i> First, I'm afraid this post is a little long, but I'm hoping it will act
</I>&gt;<i> as a motivator for some further discussion on what, if anything, to do
</I>&gt;<i> about list usage in Gtk#.
</I>
Thanks for putting together this list.

&gt;<i> To consider a solution, I think it possibly helps to think of functions
</I>&gt;<i> that *return* lists separately from functions that accept lists.
</I>
I agree.

&gt;<i> Many or all of the functions that *return* GLib lists could be converted
</I>&gt;<i> into returning ILists by hacking GLib.ListBase to implement IList
</I>&gt;<i> instead of just ICollection. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Alternatively, with some .custom writing, we could change the current
</I>&gt;<i> list return types into their relevant specific array types. Eg. instead
</I>&gt;<i> of returning a GLib.List for a 'Widgets' property, just return Widget[].
</I>&gt;<i> When the programmer doesn't want/need to modify the return type, I
</I>&gt;<i> personally favour the latter approach, as it's easier to see what the
</I>&gt;<i> API is doing just by glancing at the method signature.
</I>
I like this approach a lot more too.

&gt;<i> Methods that take GLib lists as arguments might be much more difficult
</I>&gt;<i> to marshal into something that the C API is happy to accept... I think
</I>&gt;<i> accepting an &quot;IList&quot; as the argument is probably making more effort than
</I>&gt;<i> it's worth. Again, I think it might be good to accept an array of a
</I>&gt;<i> specific type, which is then internally converted to a GLib.(S)List
</I>&gt;<i> before being passed to the underlying C function. 
</I>
I would vote for this as well.

The reason is that typical code does not deal with Glib.SLists/Lists,
but something else.  Every piece of code that deals with these APIs
basically has to &quot;wrap&quot; its internal data structure before invoking the
API.  I vote for putting the burden on Gtk# instead of the programmer.

&gt;<i> Any opinions on what I've suggested? My brain is a little fried right
</I>&gt;<i> now, but I suspect I could start write simple custom methods that
</I>&gt;<i> replace the methods/properties that currently return Glib lists with
</I>&gt;<i> array types.
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone have a different approach that might be more appropriate?
</I>
I think that .custom files are the way to go here.

Thanks again for this detailed audit of the API.

Miguel
