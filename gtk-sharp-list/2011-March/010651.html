</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> GObject doesn't have a Dispose method and doesn't use the IDispose

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> .NET developers expect Dispose to free all memory and resources hold by
</I>&gt;<i> an object, and the gtk method that better fits this definition is
</I>&gt;<i> Destroy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We can add another method for doing what Dispose currently does (such as
</I>&gt;<i> Detach or something like that). In any case, I've written thousands of
</I>&gt;<i> GTK# code in the past years, and I never had the need of such a method,
</I>&gt;<i> while I've had to write try/finally blocks to destroy dialogs many
</I>&gt;<i> times.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It makes more sense to me that Destroy call Dispose, not vice-versa,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and the using (FooDialog) pattern isn't all that compelling to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, it doesn't matter which method calls which, since calling any of
</I>&gt;<i> them should have the same result.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is in fact another source of confusion here. If a widget subclass
</I>&gt;<i> needs to free its own resources, should it override Dispose or
</I>&gt;<i> OnDestroyed? It's confusing, because Dispose is not always called when
</I>&gt;<i> destroying a widget, and OnDestroyed is only called when Destroy is
</I>&gt;<i> explicitly called (that is, it won't be called if a widget is finalized
</I>&gt;<i> because all references to it are freed). What we miss here, is a method
</I>&gt;<i> which is called when an object is finalized (in the gtk+ sense), no
</I>&gt;<i> matter how.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I propose is implementing the Dispose pattern in this way:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        * Add a Dispose method which calls Destroy. That Dispose method
</I>&gt;<i>          must be sealed.
</I>&gt;<i>        * Add a new Dispose(bool disposing) method, protected and virtual.
</I>&gt;<i>        * In the OnDestroyed handler, call Dispose(true),
</I>&gt;<i>          GC.SuppressFinalize (this), and free the ref.
</I>&gt;<i>        * In the GLib.Object finalizer, call Dispose(false) and free the
</I>&gt;<i>          ref.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Implementing the pattern in this way, both Dispose and Destroy have the
</I>&gt;<i> same effect, and the Dispose(disposing) virtual method is always called
</I>&gt;<i> (either as a result of all references being freed or by an explicit
</I>&gt;<i> dispose).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> About whether making Dispose/Destroy public or private, the framework
</I>&gt;<i> guidelines recommend using the framework terminology for 'dispose'
</I>&gt;<i> methods, and implement IDisposable explicitly. However, IDisposable is
</I>&gt;<i> implemented by GLib.Object, which doesn't have a Destroy method (Destroy
</I>&gt;<i> is defined by Gtk.Object/Widget), so making Dispose public may be a
</I>&gt;<i> better option in this case. In any case, I think it is ok having both
</I>&gt;<i> public. As Nicholas said, several .NET classes have Dispose/Close
</I>&gt;<i> methods, and it doesn't seem to cause confusion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lluis.
</I>
I agree with Lluis and Chris almost 100%. We would benefit a lot from 
the C#'s &quot;using&quot; pattern to dispose resources.

In regards to removing Destroy() or making it do the same, well, there 
are advantages and disadvantages:

Removing it: less confusing on what to use.
Leaving it, doing the same as dispose: follow Gtk+ API (we know that a 
lot of times developers just check Gtk+'s API reference instead of Gtk# 
expecting to be basically the same).

So I think I just came up with a good compromise that would have the 
best of both worlds: make Destroy() be present and do the same as 
Dispose(), but mark it as Obsolete(&quot;Use the IDisposable.Dispose method 
to improve readability and to benefit from syntax sugar&quot;) or something 
like that. This way Destroy API is discoverable, but the IDE's would 
mark it as undesirable, so it's not confusing anymore.
