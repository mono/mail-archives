 I lost Lluis' response while doing some maintenance on my email scripts 
 (whoops) but I wanted to suggest a compromise.  For some people it's 
 nice to get warnings when you've &quot;leaked&quot; an object that wraps a native 
 resource, but for others they don't care about that.  Neither approach 
 is necessarily wrong.  I'd support the option of having opt-in or 
 opt-out warnings that you control with a static property on the GObject 
 class.  Then people who are trying to tightly control their memory usage 
 can get warnings when they have failed to do so, and others who are less 
 worried about strict memory usage (for example when writing desktop 
 applications) can let the GC do its magic.
