<PRE>I am using Mono-0.29 and Gtk-Sharp-0.15, both built from source, on 
RedHat 9.0 running kernel 2.6.0.

I have begun to play around with Glade to learn building user 
interfaces.  I have created a window which houses 2 main widgets (there 
are others, of course): a MenuBar and a TextView (which is contained in 
a ScrolledWindow).  The TextView displays correctly and is operating as 
advertised.  However, the Menu is not displaying correctly.  It shows up 
at the correct height (default of 24 px) but there are no words 
visible.  Instead, I can see a 1 px tall dotted line.  It looks like 
this might correspond to the tops of letters, or perhaps the font has 
magically been shrunken.

If I need to provide screenshots or source code, let me know.  I just 
didn't want to clog everyone's mailboxes with needless attachments if 
this is a simple operator error.

Thanks,

Jeremiah McElroy
