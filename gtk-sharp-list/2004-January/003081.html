<PRE>&gt;<i> If the Gtk# developers do not want to be in sync then they can choose not to
</I>&gt;<i> be in sync, but then they would not be on the GNOME Platform Bindings
</I>&gt;<i> release schedule.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe I should not require _Beta_ Bindings to wrap some new API. For
</I>&gt;<i> instance, maybe it's OK that Gtk# does not wrap any new API from GTK+ 2.4,
</I>&gt;<i> though it will look strange to people. But Beta bindings are meant to be
</I>&gt;<i> aiming to be fully on the release schedule for the next release, so Gtk#
</I>&gt;<i> would have to get properly in-sync for GNOME 2.7/2.8, at the start.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I personally don't think &quot;beta bindings&quot; need to be tracking the latest
api so early in the process.  If they are able to make a solid release
by say API freeze (Feb. 16) or even the actual release (Mar.22) wouldn't
that be sufficient.

I think everyone (including other bindings) would be much more willing
to follow the schedule then.  In addition, with this being the first
bindings release and having been notified only a month or so ago it
would be nice for additional leeway.

Anyways, I think it is a great idea, and I hope we can be a part of it
soon.
