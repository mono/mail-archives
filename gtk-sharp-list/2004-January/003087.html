<PRE>I just wanted to post a success report since I've been bantering around
with troubles!

First the problem I was having with glade.

The libglade-2.0-0.dll problem I was having was not that at all! For
some reason my gtk+ lib directory was missing the libintl-1.dll file. So
now my glade project works fine.

Also Daniel Morgan sent me the Gtk# 0.14 binaries which I dropped into
my gtk+ directory. After changing the code for the modified api changes,
everything works.

It would be really nice if we could put all this stuff on a windows
dedicated website and keep it up to date (the wiki would work IF we can
keep it up to date!).

Now to get back to coding again!

Jae
