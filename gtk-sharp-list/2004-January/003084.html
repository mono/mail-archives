<PRE>It looks like the Windows binaries for Gtk# are not given much priority
(which is fine, since the main use is GNOME), however, I'm trying to
develop a cross-platform app that needs to run on Windows first. I
really want to use Gtk#. I currently do not have any of the Gtk# build
tools installed (cygwin, etc). It would be nice if someone would just
compile the binaries and tarball them to the SourceForge site. I don't
need an installer, just the binaries.

Is this something that is possible, Mike, anyone? I'm still having
trouble with the glade dll from several versions back. I really do think
this is cool and with the latest version of gtk+ for windows and
gtk-wimp, my windows now redraw while I move them around the screen.

Thanks for all the hard work...believe me, it is appreciated.

Jae
