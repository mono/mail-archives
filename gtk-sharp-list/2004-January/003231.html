</I>
Up until now, we have tried to track the GNOME version which is provided
by the major distributions.  Some of the reasons for this:

- to open up our testing base to the largest possible audience
- to keep the target of the binding as stable as possible, our API is
unstable enough now without tracking an unstable bound API.
- to ensure that when we finally get the binding right, it can be
immediately used in production environments.

My current plan is to ship Gtk#'s first &quot;stable&quot; release against the
GNOME 2.2 platform, unless all the distros move to 2.4 before we
release.  The first &quot;stable&quot; Gtk# is planned to be delivered with mono
1.0 in Q2/2004.

Once we have declared a stable release, we will branch CVS, freeze the
API, and move to the current development series of GNOME libraries. 
Based on the timing as it looks now, this would mean a jump from GNOME
2.2 to GNOME 2.7.  Once we have a stable release out there for people to
deploy apps against, we can afford to track the bleeding edge from then
on.

We can consider branching for &quot;stable&quot; GNOME 2.4 and 2.6 releases as
they become widely available in the distros.  Once we get the
parser/generator up to speed with 2.7, to do a 2.4 branch should be
pretty painless, since the binding is predominantly generated.  However,
it is unlikely that I will have time for backporting customizations and
fixes from trunk to any intermediate releases.
