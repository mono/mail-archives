Probably.  But it would take some work, as I don't think there are any
VS.NET project files in CVS, so you'd have to create your own, at
least.  Plus, you'd first have to get the &quot;generated&quot; .cs files (which
are in turn based off the XML API description files and the *.custom
files), so you'd still have to use part of the current Gtk# build
system.

Here I think someone is confused.  Gtk# isn't a .exe, it's a set of
.dll's (though the samples are .exes, but who cares about the samples? 
In terms of performance, anyway?).

Furthermore, Gtk# is managed code (wrapping a native library, of
course).  The only possible benefit to compiling Gtk# under VS.NET is to
get the (presumably better?) optimizations that CSC.EXE provides but MCS
doesn't currently provide.

However, given that most of Gtk# (that I've seen) is a thin-ish wrapper
over the native GTK+ libraries, I find it doubtful that any CSC.EXE
optimizations would actually provide a significant performance gain.

So I highly doubt that a VS.NET-compiled version of Gtk# would be any
faster than an mcs-generated version.

A better bet would be to compile GTK+ with VS.NET instead of GCC -- at
least GTK+ is a large body of code, and VS.NET tends to have decent
native code optimization.  I have no idea if this is even possible,
though.
