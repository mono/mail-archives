<PRE>I would be happy to, but I don't even know if I'm implementing it right
yet. Is there a simple standalone sample that populates a treeview with
some text and icons (like nunit-gtk (little red, green circles) without
the nunit dependancy) that is known to work on linux...then I would know
it is correct! If it still crashes on windows I could submit the bug.

I may just not know what I'm doing! Even though I'm struggling along, it
is obvious that the Gtk# TreeView is much more powerful than the
Windows.Forms.TreeView component.

Thanks,

Jae
