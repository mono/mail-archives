<PRE>Well, I finally found the solution to my own problem. The code was perfect,
there was nothing wrong with it. Only thing is that Ubuntu 12.04 doesn't
include any mono stuff by default. In particular, it has these packages are
the basic mono dependencies:

mono-runtime
libgtk2.0-cil
libmono-posix4.0-cil

However, once you &quot;apt-get install&quot; these three packages your c#-cum-gtk#
application will run zip-zap-zoom as shown in below screenshot of my program
which was developed on Windows-7 and runs in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS!!

&lt;<A HREF="http://mono.1490590.n4.nabble.com/file/n4659123/editSharp.png">http://mono.1490590.n4.nabble.com/file/n4659123/editSharp.png</A>&gt; 

So, these three are just basic mono packages you need to get going if you
just use gtk# gui and the .NET Framework class libraries. Of course, there
will be additional packages if you make use of any third party packages like
TK#, Qt#, etc.

Well, this has opened a pandora's box for me :-)) Since, having worked on
windows platform throughout, C# is the only language I have expertise in
(I'm still learning C++ and java, but thats going to take a lot of time).
Now that I've found a WinForms substitute in GTK# and signals, I can't wait
to let loose my creativity in various areas like System.Net, System.IO,
System.Security.Cryptography, System.Threading, System.Drawing and other
interesting stuff!! Do any of you know how these things work out on mono
platform in real world programs ?

Thanks to this page that I stumbled upon this solution:

PS: MainWindow is the default class name that monoDevelop gave me when I
started a new project. I'm talking about the latest version of monoDevelop
(4.0) which is based on .NET Framework 4.0
