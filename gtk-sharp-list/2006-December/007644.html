<PRE>2006/12/15, Mike Kestner &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/gtk-sharp-list">mkestner at novell.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I'd be interested in hearing the list of many excellent widgets we've
</I>&gt;<i> rejected.  I don't think we've ever set a policy saying that managed
</I>&gt;<i> widgets are not welcome in Gtk#.  In fact, I'd like to pursue this down
</I>&gt;<i> the road, perhaps, distinguishing Gtk# further through a maintained set
</I>&gt;<i> of enhanced widgets.
</I>
I can only recall the data grid of the top of my head since I was
going to work on it-eventually I decided against it for license
reasons. Look for Gtk.Controls and Datagrid in your list. I can
remember two other that recived the same fate, but cannot remember
what they where.

&gt;<i> That said, the widgets would need to be general purpose enough to be
</I>&gt;<i> compelling to a wide audience.  I honestly can't recall turning such a
</I>&gt;<i> widget away, but my memory isn't what it used to be.
</I>
The Datagrid would surely fit that general purposenes requirement.
This dock-icon would, too.

</I>
The real reason I stopped working on the Gtk# Datagrid was license. I
would not worlk with any licence not GPL/LGPL, and the other members
would rather it under the more libertene X11 license (not free,
libertine). In the end, they won and I retired.

I guess I could have forked an GPL vertion. It would still have all
the maintnance problems fork have. GPL would have also allowed me to
have the advantage over them, as I could hhave incorporated their work
and freed it, but they would not be able to do the same on my code
unless they brought it to freedom.

In the end, however, it was too much work for nothing. X11 license
also gives me, the end user, the freedom to use the software under any
way I might possibly choose. It does not grant me the ability to make
proprietary vertions of it, but as an end user it matters not. It is
only when I am a software house that thee differences apply, and then
it gives me the ability to microsoft other people's work into my own
propietary software.

Jesus bless you,

Victor Rivarola
