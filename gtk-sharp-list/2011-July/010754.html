<PRE>Hello everybody,

I'm a long-time C# developer but new to Mono and, especially, Gtk#. I have
developed a small app using C# and Gtk#. I need this app to work on Windows,
Linux and Mac so I decided to go for Mono and, so far, it seems to be a cool
framework. Thumbs up to the team and the contributors behind it!

What my simple app does is start up an XSP web server based on a local
directory and port chosen by the user. Ideally, I would like my app to work
without having to install the Mono framework at first, but this is not a
must to begin with. I am using the following libraries:

using System;
using Gtk;
using System.Net;
using Mono.WebServer;
using System.Diagnostics;

I am developing on a Mac (Snow Leopard, 10.6.7). My executable works
perfectly on my Mac. But I am having problems with Ubuntu and Windows. My
app works partly on Ubuntu (11.04) -- it starts up and seems to be working
but fails when I try to start the XSP web server, which seems expectable as
/Mono.Webserver/ is probably not installed on my Ubuntu machine. On Windows
(7, 64-bit), my app crashes immediately when I double-click on it. The crash
report tells me that a &quot;System.IO.FileNotFoundException&quot; occurred. Probably
due to the same missing XSP library?

Anyway, I looked around on the Internet and learned about *mkbundle*. I have
performed the following setting as suggested by various forum threads:

*export AS=&quot;as -arch i386&quot;*

I have navigated to the /bin/Release directory of my project and, then, run
the following command:

*mkbundle MivandoLocalServer.exe -o MivandoLocalServer --deps*

But I am getting the following output, which eventually fails:

Compiling:
as -arch i386 -o temp.o temp.s 
cc -g -o MivandoLocalServer -Wall temp.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs mono-2` 
temp.o
Package mono-2 was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `mono-2.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
No package 'mono-2' found
temp.c:2:36: error: mono/metadata/assembly.h: No such file or directory
temp.c:5: error: expected &#8216;=&#8217;, &#8216;,&#8217;, &#8216;;&#8217;, &#8216;asm&#8217; or &#8216;__attribute__&#8217; before
&#8216;assembly_bundle_MivandoLocalServer_exe&#8217;
temp.c:7: error: expected &#8216;=&#8217;, &#8216;,&#8217;, &#8216;;&#8217;, &#8216;asm&#8217; or &#8216;__attribute__&#8217; before &#8216;*&#8217;
token
temp.c:18: error: &#8216;NULL&#8217; undeclared here (not in a function)
temp.c: In function &#8216;mono_mkbundle_init&#8217;:
temp.c:22: warning: implicit declaration of function
&#8216;mono_register_bundled_assemblies&#8217;
temp.c:22: error: &#8216;bundled&#8217; undeclared (first use in this function)
temp.c:22: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
temp.c:22: error: for each function it appears in.)
temp.c: In function &#8216;main&#8217;:
temp.c:114: warning: implicit declaration of function &#8216;mono_set_dirs&#8217;
[Fail]

I really do not know what to do from here. I have MacPorts installed and I
have read that this might cause some problems with regards to the
/pkg-config/ directory. Is this true? If yes, what will I have to do make it
work?

I hope that somebody will be able to help me. Thanks!

Best regards,
Sebastian
