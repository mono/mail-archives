<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>I am working on a Mono GTK# desktop app written in C#. I have developed my
app using the MonoDevelop IDE (v2.4.2) on a Mac (OS X v10.6.7). My app
depends on the /GTK#/ library (obviously) as well as the /Mono.WebServer2/
library for running a local ASP.NET server.

I have tested my app on my own Mac as well as other Macs. Everything is
working out great. Now, I am interested in porting my app to other platforms
(specifically, Windows 7 and Ubuntu v11.04). I have been playing around with
the *mkbundle* command but I haven't had any luck in creating a working
bundle for other platforms than Mac OS X.

Since I have tried a number of different solutions without success, I would
like to hear from the Mono developers out there. What do you do to port your
app to other platforms?

I have been developing C# using Visual Studio for a long time but I am new
to the Mono development environment. Therefore, I would very much appreciate
a detailed explanation.

Thank you very much!
