This is correct, but only partially.

You need all of:

  - The assemblies you use (gtk-sharp.dll, etc.)
  - The .config files for those assemblies (gtk-sharp.dll.config, etc. 
    -- and those are located in the GAC, not in the 
    $prefix/lib/mono/gtk-sharp-2.0 directory.
  - All &quot;glue&quot; libraries, e.g. /usr/lib/libgtksharpglue.so

Because of the last one, you'll need to use a shell-script to invoke
your program, and within that script you'll need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH
to include the directory that contains those &quot;glue&quot; libraries.

Furthermore (again, because of the glue libs), this will only work for
Linux distros; you won't be able to use the same &quot;bundle&quot; with Win32, as
you'll need the win32 glue libraries as well.

In short, it's possible (or should be), but it's not easy.
