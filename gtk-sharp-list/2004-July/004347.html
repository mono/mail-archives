make it short though. (inline)

</I>&gt;<i> I will try to expand my previous reasons for you:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the reasons are:
</I>&gt;<i> 1.1 It avoids confusion by having too many versions of the API.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Developers don't have to ask think too hard about what version of the
</I>&gt;<i> API they are targetting, because there are usually just 2 widely-
</I>&gt;<i> deployed, clearly-defined APIs. This is mostly a matter of making life
</I>&gt;<i> simpler for developers and distributors, but I think that's a very good
</I>&gt;<i> reason, particularly when the time to wait for a new stable release with
</I>&gt;<i> your new API is rarely more than 4 months. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1.2 It allows new API to be tested properly in unstable releases,
</I>&gt;<i> instead of suddenly appearing in a minor stable release.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You need to make unstable releases to test large new API. APIs are not
</I>&gt;<i> born perfect, and people don't test them enough when they are just
</I>&gt;<i> sitting in CVS. In fact, the need to have them tested in CVS can make
</I>&gt;<i> you too scared to release a tarball to provide other unrelated
</I>&gt;<i> improvements. This unstable/stable release schedule is a major reason
</I>&gt;<i> for GNOME's quality success since GNOME 2.0, compared to the chaos and
</I>&gt;<i> awful APIs of before that. That's not a controversial opinion.
</I>
Again, you talk about large new API, and I don't think anyone has 
suggested adding 'large new API', just cleaning and polishing existing API.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>You keep trying, but you keep not articulating your reasons.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let me make it clear again. These are not my policies. These's are
</I>&gt;<i> GNOME's policies. The release team just tries to represent the consensus
</I>&gt;<i> and provide a framework in which they want to work. However, I
</I>&gt;<i> personally happen to think that the GNOME community has got things
</I>&gt;<i> right.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you disagree with the current API/ABI guidelines and/or the GNOME
</I>&gt;<i> time-based release process then please talk to the GNOME community about
</I>&gt;<i> it. Before doing that, I encourage you to read our notes about the GNOME
</I>&gt;<i> release process:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://developer.gnome.org/dotplan/">http://developer.gnome.org/dotplan/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And I'll make it clear once again: You can do whatever you like with
</I>&gt;<i> Gtk# 1.0 as long as it's not in an official GNOME release set.
</I>
They aren't, and 1.0 is already out, so whats the deal?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But I would like to see mono bindings, and other bindings, being taken
</I>&gt;<i> as seriously as the GNOME Platform's C APIs. Only then will people be
</I>&gt;<i> comfortable with developing core GNOME Desktop applications with these
</I>&gt;<i> languages. Choice is good. Chaos is bad. 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>
How exactly will mono bindings being inside this platform release set 
change the fact that nothing but C is allowed in the core GNOME Desktop 
release.

Inclusion in some random binding release set is unimportant when GNOME 
itself doesnt allow anything but C in the core GNOME Desktop release.

In fact, the only language that seems to be considered for allowable 
inclusion in the core GNOME Desktop release is python, which isnt a part 
of your binding set.

And I think the outpouring of mono/gtk# apps that you can see shows that 
people already take it seriously. Being included or not in any binding 
release set wont change that.
