<PRE>Hey,

&gt;<i> It's not good though. I was trying to demonstrate that minor breaks
</I>&gt;<i> changes are allowed - the release process is not meant to make life
</I>&gt;<i> difficult. There is an established freeze-break approval process, and
</I>&gt;<i> current GNOME Platform maintainers are fully aware of it. 
</I>
And I have never heard of a good argument against adding APIs.  You
keep trying, but other than `thats what we do around here' you have not
articulated why this is good.

&gt;<i> I don't think Mono changes concepts of API stability. You are not
</I>&gt;<i> special.
</I>
I was making fun of you.

&gt;<i> I think if you want to be a development platform then you have to act
</I>&gt;<i> like a development platform. It's incredibly arrogant of you to think
</I>&gt;<i> that you don't need to fit in with the rest of the GNOME platform even
</I>&gt;<i> one little bit.
</I>
And adding APIs will always succeed, because it does not break existing
software;   And new software can just require a new version.

You keep trying, but you keep not articulating your reasons.

Miguel
