My interpretation of Mike Kestner's statements follows this line of
reasoning.  He even provides the perfect example:

&gt;<i> &gt; However, if a parameter is really an int[], but the generator has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; produced an &quot;out int&quot; parameter (as is the default case for an int*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; parameter that has not been marked as an array with metadata), there is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no way to use such a method with the out int semantic.  Anybody that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would try to use it as such would quickly find out that it doesn't work,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and would probably be filing a bug report.
</I>
If the choice is between waiting (at most) 6 months for an API fix (for
the next stable release) or waiting a few days to a few weeks for a
point-release, I'll take the point release.  I suspect most developers
would agree.
