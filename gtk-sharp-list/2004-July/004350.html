His blog entry suggests a lot more than that, and that's why I'm
mentioning it:
&quot;
We are also going take advantage of the nice Assembly versioning and GAC
functionality of mono to allow the addition of missing API related to
the 2.2 Platform and convenience overloads for methods. This gives us a
fair amount of flexibility to continue to improve the 2.2 bindings for a
while, without breaking existing code developed against Gtk# 1.0.&quot;

It is a waste of time to argue so energetically if you have not read the
thread so you don't even know what is being dicussed.
 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Do we need to get someone on the release team so we can ok our breaks 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;like you do?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No, just follow the regular, well-known, documented freeze-break
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; approval process:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://developer.gnome.org/dotplan/tasks.html#ApprovingFreezeBreaks">http://developer.gnome.org/dotplan/tasks.html#ApprovingFreezeBreaks</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Which you just said yourself you don't follow. How can you expect other 
</I>&gt;<i> binding writers to follow a specification that you are incapable or 
</I>&gt;<i> unwilling to follow?
</I>
I challenge you to find any large API change in a gtkmm stable series.
