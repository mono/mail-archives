<PRE>Any newbie help for installing Gtk-sharp and Mono on Mandrake Linux?
Has anyone successfully installed Gtk-sharp and Mono on Mandrake Linux?

I have worked thru a handful of example programs from &quot;Mono Kick Start&quot; and
successfully compiled with mcs on Windows 2K.  Would like to port to home
desktop Mandrake Linux 9.2 PC.  I have not been able to install Gtk-sharp
on Mandrake Linux.

A nice step by step explanation of how to install Gtk-sharp and Mono on to
a Mandrake Linux PC that even a clueless Windows user could understand will
be greatly appreciated.

Thanks ahead of time,
Rick
