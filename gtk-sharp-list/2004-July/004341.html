I am on the release-team, so I kind of self-approve my freeze breaks.
It's not good though. I was trying to demonstrate that minor breaks
changes are allowed - the release process is not meant to make life
difficult. There is an established freeze-break approval process, and
current GNOME Platform maintainers are fully aware of it. 

&gt;<i> Anyways, we have different dynamics in the Mono world, its just a nice

</I>&gt;<i> platform on earth ;-)
</I>
I don't think Mono changes concepts of API stability. You are not
special.

I think if you want to be a development platform then you have to act
like a development platform. It's incredibly arrogant of you to think
that you don't need to fit in with the rest of the GNOME platform even
one little bit.
