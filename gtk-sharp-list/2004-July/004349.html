I think it was on his blog, presumably this article:

&lt;URL:<A HREF="http://primates.ximian.com/~mkestner/weblog/pivot/entry.php?id=44">http://primates.ximian.com/~mkestner/weblog/pivot/entry.php?id=44</A>&gt;

In particular, this paragraph:

----
The API freeze that we have in place now for 1.0 still allows us to fix
broken API bindings. We are also going take advantage of the nice Assembly
versioning and GAC functionality of mono to allow the addition of missing
API related to the 2.2 Platform and convenience overloads for methods. This
gives us a fair amount of flexibility to continue to improve the 2.2
bindings for a while, without breaking existing code developed against Gtk#
1.0. As an app developer, sticking with 2.2 should not disappoint you too
much, since using newer API locks your app out of the still enormous Gnome
2.2 installed base.
----

Cheers,

Chris
