You touch on one important detail, which also highlights a difference

The important difference is this: most of Gtk# is a very low level, thin
wrapper of the actual GNOME libraries.  The Gnome libraries benefit from
the stable/unstable release cycle because they're releasing libraries
which haven't been used before, so getting feedback is important before
ensuring API/ABI stability.

Much of Gtk# is different: new API, completely untested, isn't being
written.  Wrappers for existing code are being written, as well as
helper overloads for existing code.  This is a significantly simpler
operation, with fewer concerns about &quot;screwing the API up&quot;.

For more &quot;enthusiastic&quot; API additions -- code which isn't just a thin
wrapper over existing libraries, but is instead a substantial change in
their own right, such as Data Binding and similar functionality,
*should* fall under the traditional stable/unstable release.  This makes
more sense, as it can benefit from the increased testing and feedback
cycle, contributing to a higher quality API.
