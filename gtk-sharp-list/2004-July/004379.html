There is no long-term plan to stay a version behind.  There is also no
near-term plan to track the bleeding edge.  ;-)

I think it is important to support the GNOME 2.6 release set with a
stable Gtk# release line because of the important additions in Gtk-2.4.
There are distributions that are already shipping 2.6, so I think it is
a likely &quot;next step&quot; for application developers to take.  

If I had the time to write an application and it was still in feature
addition mode, I'd personally continue to target Gtk# 1.0 after October,
though.  I don't personally see the value in targeting an API that half
your users don't have installed.  For 2.8 in October, that's going to be
more like 99% unavailable. 

That said.  When we are in the enviable position of having rock solid
stable releases on all the important stable GNOME versions, we will
probably track the GNOME development cycle for the hardy few that like
to build GNOME from source in order to write applications that only they
themselves can run.  :-)
