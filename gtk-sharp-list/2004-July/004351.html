</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I will try to expand my previous reasons for you:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think the reasons are:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1.1 It avoids confusion by having too many versions of the API.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Developers don't have to ask think too hard about what version of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; API they are targetting, because there are usually just 2 widely-
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; deployed, clearly-defined APIs. This is mostly a matter of making life
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; simpler for developers and distributors, but I think that's a very good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reason, particularly when the time to wait for a new stable release with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; your new API is rarely more than 4 months. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1.2 It allows new API to be tested properly in unstable releases,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instead of suddenly appearing in a minor stable release.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You need to make unstable releases to test large new API. APIs are not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; born perfect, and people don't test them enough when they are just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sitting in CVS. In fact, the need to have them tested in CVS can make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you too scared to release a tarball to provide other unrelated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; improvements. This unstable/stable release schedule is a major reason
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for GNOME's quality success since GNOME 2.0, compared to the chaos and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; awful APIs of before that. That's not a controversial opinion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again, you talk about large new API, and I don't think anyone has 
</I>&gt;<i> suggested adding 'large new API', just cleaning and polishing existing API.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;You keep trying, but you keep not articulating your reasons.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Let me make it clear again. These are not my policies. These's are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GNOME's policies. The release team just tries to represent the consensus
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and provide a framework in which they want to work. However, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; personally happen to think that the GNOME community has got things
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; right.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you disagree with the current API/ABI guidelines and/or the GNOME
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time-based release process then please talk to the GNOME community about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it. Before doing that, I encourage you to read our notes about the GNOME
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; release process:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://developer.gnome.org/dotplan/">http://developer.gnome.org/dotplan/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And I'll make it clear once again: You can do whatever you like with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Gtk# 1.0 as long as it's not in an official GNOME release set.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> They aren't, and 1.0 is already out, so whats the deal?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But I would like to see mono bindings, and other bindings, being taken
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as seriously as the GNOME Platform's C APIs. Only then will people be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; comfortable with developing core GNOME Desktop applications with these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; languages. Choice is good. Chaos is bad. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How exactly will mono bindings being inside this platform release set 
</I>&gt;<i> change the fact that nothing but C is allowed in the core GNOME Desktop 
</I>&gt;<i> release.
</I>
Use of C in the GNOME DEsktop is a) Not actually official anywhere, so
there is no offical obstacle to the use of another language in the GNOME
Desktop. Although it's not a big departure, Epiphany and GnomeMeeting
use C++, though they don't use the C++ bindings.

It is not love of C that is keeping GNOME Desktop applications in C. 

&gt;<i> Inclusion in some random binding release set is unimportant when GNOME 
</I>&gt;<i> itself doesnt allow anything but C in the core GNOME Desktop release.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, the only language that seems to be considered for allowable 
</I>&gt;<i> inclusion in the core GNOME Desktop release is python, which isnt a part 
</I>&gt;<i> of your binding set.
</I>
Yes it is.

&gt;<i> And I think the outpouring of mono/gtk# apps that you can see shows that 
</I>&gt;<i> people already take it seriously. Being included or not in any binding 
</I>&gt;<i> release set wont change that.
</I>
I don't think you even know what you are arguing about anymore.
