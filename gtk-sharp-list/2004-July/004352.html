Yes, it's easier to get the API right, but your API will still not be
perfect from the start. You have changed API after you first wrote it
and you will again.

We need to be very careful when changing any API when we don't have the
chance to change it again.

I do have a great deal of experience with this situation.

&gt;<i> For more &quot;enthusiastic&quot; API additions -- code which isn't just a thin

</I>&gt;<i> their own right, such as Data Binding and similar functionality,
</I>&gt;<i> *should* fall under the traditional stable/unstable release.  This makes
</I>&gt;<i> more sense, as it can benefit from the increased testing and feedback
</I>&gt;<i> cycle, contributing to a higher quality API.
