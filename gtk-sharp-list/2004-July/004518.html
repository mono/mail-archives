<PRE>Not only do we lose the translations, but dont we also lose any pre-defined
accelerators ?
It also sounds like gtk# is moving away from the way that glade defines a UI
? If so where are we headed in regards to the likes of translation and
platform unity (in my oppinion one of the strengths of gtk is it's
uniformity of UI - makes it easier on the &quot;newbies&quot; like me and makes
standard fuctions and translations easier to implement) ?

I've probably got it all wrong and gtk# is probably only following gtk+ in
terms of functionality, but since C++ is not one of the languages that I am
at all familiar with I cannot tell.

Why do I need to know ? - Hint - I am asking about the creation (in code) of
a related item in a glade xml file - Sounds suspiciously like someone
working on a managed code generating gui designer to me ;-)

Cheers

Matt

&gt;<i> &gt; a little explanation is in order.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I need a comprehensive understanding of all the standard Gtk widget

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; marked as deprecated in the documentation, I made the (probably unsound)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; assumption that it had already been replaced (logic being that it must
</I>have
&gt;<i> &gt; been replaced in order for it to be marked as deprecated).  Hence my

&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Since it now looks like InsertStock's replacement does not yet exist, I
</I>am
&gt;<i> &gt; unsure as to why it is deprecated without a suitable replacement method
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; being ready.  Stock items *seem* to be an such integral part of rapidly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; building Gtk apps I fail to see the logic.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm sure there *must* be a logic to it, but coming from an MS.net
</I>background
&gt;<i> &gt; it escapes me.  Perhaps deprecated doesn't mean &quot;going out of use - use
</I>the
&gt;<i> &gt; new way&quot; which is what I understood it to be ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The more I think about it - the more sure I become that this is a

</I>&gt;<i> Ok,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After actually *looking* at the mono docs on the web, my answer differs
</I>&gt;<i> a little :)
</I>&gt;<i> InsertStock seems to be deprecated, as you said, already in gtk# 1.0
</I>&gt;<i> (gtk 2.2) and there is not any replacement.
</I>&gt;<i> The preffered methods, as said in the docs, is to use AppendItem,
</I>&gt;<i> PrependItem and InsertItem.
</I>&gt;<i> So if you want to use a stock button in your toolbar you have to use
</I>&gt;<i> following code:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Image image = new Image (Stock.Open, IconSize.SmallToolbar);
</I>&gt;<i> toolbar.AppendItem (&quot;Open&quot;, &quot;open&quot;, &quot;open&quot;, image, new SignalFunc
</I>&gt;<i> (open_callback));
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't really know how deprecated widgets and methods will be treated
</I>&gt;<i> in gtk#, but gtk+ have a API guarantee for the 2.x release cycle.
</I>&gt;<i> So if you use a method that is deprecated in e.g. 2.2, it should still
</I>&gt;<i> work in 2.8, but probably not 3.0.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In gtk# 2.0 (gtk+ 2.4) there is going to be a complete new menu and
</I>&gt;<i> toolbar system that is actionbased.
</I>&gt;<i> The menus and toolbars is defined in xml-files and you can easily merge
</I>&gt;<i> two menus or toolbars.
</I>&gt;<i> So if you can wait til october/november for pre-releases, or use the
</I>&gt;<i> jerone-gtk-2-4 branch from cvs, I would use that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hope this clear things up a bit.
