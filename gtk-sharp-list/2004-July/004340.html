<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The API rules and the whole release process are not meant to make life
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; difficult for you, or to get in your way. But large API changes have no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; place in a stable release. The GNOME developers seem quite united in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; their approval of this policy.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; While I was the maintainer of libgnome, my policy was to keep backwards
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compatibility, but new APIs could be introduced (since they would not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; break old software).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The Gtk+ maintainers have a different position.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But I would not characterize &quot;The GNOME developers&quot; being &quot;quite
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; united&quot;, we disagreed in the past, and we seem to disagree now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I can tell, all current maintainers of GNOME Platform
</I>&gt;<i> libraries are very clear about this. The release process is now very
</I>&gt;<i> established and they don't just ignore the freezes.
</I>
Except for yourself, according to your message indicating you've broken
the policy.

Anyways, we have different dynamics in the Mono world, its just a nice
result of being able to move swiftly with the most fantastic development
platform on earth ;-)

Miguel
