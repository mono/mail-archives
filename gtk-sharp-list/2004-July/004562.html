<PRE>Hi,
    I am trying to develop (initially a standalone) an extensible glade
clone in c# / gtk#.  My question is :-

Is there a &quot;bare&quot; base set of gtk / gtk# functionality that remains the same
regardless of the gtk / gtk# versions ?

Why am I asking ?

Well I'd like to make the gui designer as flexible as possible, allowing for
the addition of widgets / extenstions to the current gtk# framework.  In
order for a long lifespan and to keep this as 'tight' as possible, I would
*like* to only have to code it once (yeah we can all dream lol).

For this to fit in the way I want it, it would be capable of having new
widgets,methods and properties added to it's layout (on systems that have
newer versions of gtk / gtk# or even for people to add some of the widgets /
methods / properties that I may miss out) whilst still being capable of
running on the &quot;bare common&quot; subset in order to reduce the dependency tree
(i.e. you can run it on any released combination of gtk# / gtk).

If I can figure this out I would *hope* to have a gui designer that can be
re-used as plug-ins for other projects such as monodevelop (I know that a
gui designer for monodevelop is already underway but ...... well I like a
challenge).

Cheers in advance for any help.

Matt
