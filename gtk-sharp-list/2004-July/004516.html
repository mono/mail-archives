Ok,

After actually *looking* at the mono docs on the web, my answer differs
a little :)
InsertStock seems to be deprecated, as you said, already in gtk# 1.0
(gtk 2.2) and there is not any replacement.
The preffered methods, as said in the docs, is to use AppendItem,
PrependItem and InsertItem.
So if you want to use a stock button in your toolbar you have to use
following code:
	
	Image image = new Image (Stock.Open, IconSize.SmallToolbar);
	toolbar.AppendItem (&quot;Open&quot;, &quot;open&quot;, &quot;open&quot;, image, new SignalFunc
(open_callback));

I don't really know how deprecated widgets and methods will be treated
in gtk#, but gtk+ have a API guarantee for the 2.x release cycle.
So if you use a method that is deprecated in e.g. 2.2, it should still
work in 2.8, but probably not 3.0.

In gtk# 2.0 (gtk+ 2.4) there is going to be a complete new menu and
toolbar system that is actionbased.
The menus and toolbars is defined in xml-files and you can easily merge
two menus or toolbars.
So if you can wait til october/november for pre-releases, or use the
jerone-gtk-2-4 branch from cvs, I would use that.

Hope this clear things up a bit.

/Fredrik
