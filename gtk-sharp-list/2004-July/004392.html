<PRE>My project for SDD at school was application written in C# using GTK#,
and Glade. It worked fine in Linux where I was developing it, but when
it came time to test it out in Windows, it failed. I'm not sure what
it was, because the code worked fine in Linux but that doesn't matter
now, since I talked to my teacher, and he gave me a small extension,
and I rewrote the program using Windows.Forms. This was with before
the 1.0 release though.

I had tested the program during the early stages in development, and
because it was working fine, I didn't bother to continue to test it at
various stages of development. Sure taught me!
