<PRE>Hi guys,

I'm really frustrated about Gtk#. By now I have found 4 
bugs(TreeModelFilter.ModifyFunc, broken SetValue methods, GType of 
*Adapter classes wrong, virtual methods ignored by object genratable) 
just by development. I have created patches for two of these and need 
further info to create one for the &quot;GType of the *Adapter classes&quot; bug. 
One patch has already made it to SVN, the other one is for a bug that 
hasn't even been assigned since more than 1 week and until now I haven't 
gotten the info I need to create the third patch.

I have also created a new feature for Gtk#(GObject property 
registration) and sent a patch to the mailing list 8 days ago; I didn't 
get any feedback on it.

That all costed me hell of a lot time (about eight hours for two weeks 
just for Gtk#) to create bug reports and the new feature. I don't blame 
you that I had to do so; this is free software that lives from its 
community(and the generous support of Novell). But by ignoring the 
patches you are implicitly telling me that my work(and community efforts 
in general) are not appreciated.

I did already write 3 posts to the mailing list and didn't get a reply; 
please prove that you can do better by commenting on this post and 
telling me what will happen to the GObject patch ;-)
</PRE>
