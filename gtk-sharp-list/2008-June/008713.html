Sorry about that.  I appreciate your efforts on providing patches.  I
saw the TreeModelFilter patch land over the weekend, and meant to
comment on it.  As you indicated in your comments, it still needs some
work and I needed to spend some time investigating to give you
appropriate feedback.

&gt;<i> I have also created a new feature for Gtk#(GObject property 
</I>&gt;<i> registration) and sent a patch to the mailing list 8 days ago; I didn't 
</I>&gt;<i> get any feedback on it.
</I>
This one I don't remember seeing, can you attach it to a bug or send it
to me directly.

&gt;<i> That all costed me hell of a lot time (about eight hours for two weeks 
</I>&gt;<i> just for Gtk#) to create bug reports and the new feature. I don't blame 
</I>&gt;<i> you that I had to do so; this is free software that lives from its

</I>&gt;<i> patches you are implicitly telling me that my work(and community efforts 
</I>&gt;<i> in general) are not appreciated.
</I>
That's one interpretation.  Another is that our team is very small,
taking on an enormous development space, and occasionally we drop the
ball on some patch review.  I am certainly not ignoring your patches.
At the moment, I've been focusing on MonoDevelop, my other job on the
mono team.  Again, I apologize that your patches haven't gotten the
swift attention they should have.

&gt;<i> I did already write 3 posts to the mailing list and didn't get a reply; 
</I>&gt;<i> please prove that you can do better by commenting on this post and 
</I>&gt;<i> telling me what will happen to the GObject patch ;-)
</I>
The number of active contributors to the list is pretty small, and you
are asking some fairly difficult questions.  If you are an irc user,
feel free to drop into #monodev on gimpnet at any time and ask
questions.  I'm in there 8-10 hours a day on weekdays as user mkestner.
Sometimes bugzilla and mailing lists just sit a while every now and
then.  It's certainly not because we don't care about your
contributions.

I'll comment on your bug reports this afternoon.

Thanks,
Mike
