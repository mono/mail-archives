<PRE>Hey Billy,

Not sure if it will make any difference, but rather than building from
svn why don't you try grabbing Brad's pre-built 2.10.4 installer from
here:

<A HREF="http://bzr.medsphere.com/~brad/experimental/gtksharp-sdk-2.10.4-1-unofficial.msi">http://bzr.medsphere.com/~brad/experimental/gtksharp-sdk-2.10.4-1-unofficial.msi</A>

If you're using that then you should have the following in the
environment:

GTK_BASEPATH=C:\Program Files\Medsphere\Gtk# SDK\
PATH=C:\Program Files\Medsphere\Gtk# SDK\bin

The person who filed ticket #12 talks about GTK-BASE being correctly
set, but I'm not sure what GTK-BASE is.  Maybe he meant GTK_BASEPATH but
that seems like something to double check.

You seem to be asking the right questions in the bug reports though.  If
the user has any old versions of GTK+ or Gtk# installed anywhere on the
system, it's possible that they will conflict.
