<PRE>&gt;<i> I'm really frustrated about Gtk#. By now I have found 4 
</I>&gt;<i> bugs(TreeModelFilter.ModifyFunc, broken SetValue methods, GType of 
</I>&gt;<i> *Adapter classes wrong, virtual methods ignored by object genratable) 
</I>&gt;<i> just by development. I have created patches for two of these and need 
</I>&gt;<i> further info to create one for the &quot;GType of the *Adapter classes&quot; bug. 
</I>&gt;<i> One patch has already made it to SVN, the other one is for a bug that 
</I>&gt;<i> hasn't even been assigned since more than 1 week and until now I haven't 
</I>&gt;<i> gotten the info I need to create the third patch.
</I>
This list is typically pretty low volume.  If you want immediate
developer-ish feedback it might be better to hit the Mono IRC channel
which seems pretty active.  Most of the traffic on this list seems to
related to just consuming Gtk# and not necessarily hacking Gtk#.
