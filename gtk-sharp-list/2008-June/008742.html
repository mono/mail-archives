<PRE>Hi Cody:

I've thinking about this, and I think I don't need to do anything
special for Windows as I don't use any glue code. Generating the
bindings is just generating the C# code. I'll try to explain the
situation a little bit.
My C library is just a GTK Widget (GtkTimeScale), witch is a kind of
scale with three cursors. The first one delimits the start, the second
one the position, and the third one the stop. This widget cand send 3
signals :
in_changed
out_changed
pos_changed
Witch are sended when one of the cursor is moved.
On Linux I comple the library and I use the C# code generated by the
GAPI tools: all works great. On windows I do the same, I compile the
lbrary and I use the C# code generate by the GAPI tools.
If I don't connect any of the three signals, the widget is displayed and
I can move the cursors without any problem. The problem comes when I add
an event handler for one of the 3 signals. When I move the cursor the
signal is sended and caught and my app finishes.
I'm having the same problem with  Gstreamer player. I compile the C libs
for the GstPlayer, I run my app with the GstPlayer bindings, and all
works well. The movie is playing on Windows (When I saw it for the first
time I was really happy because I was having a C# multiplatform video
player) but when the movie reaches the final and the end_of_stream event
is sended, the app deads again. 
I don't really know why because 2 months ago I din have this problem. I
have tried to compile it on Visual studio with cygwin and mingw, and
always with the same result. I don't know how to debug  it...
Can I send you the sources so you can try to comple it and execute it?

By the way I notice just at the beginning of the execution of my test
app (a simple window with the gtktimescale) this:
Method (wrapper runtime-invoke) System.Object:runtime_invoke_void_string
(object,intptr,intptr,intptr) emitted at 00F60028 to 00F600BD (code
