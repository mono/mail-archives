on interactive applications.

I am working on a Powerball simulator and I'm just completely lost on
how to make the application part responsive.

Basically, there are a lot of fields (you can see an image at
<A HREF="http://quarter-flash.com/powerball.png">http://quarter-flash.com/powerball.png</A>) and the [Play] button kicks
off either a thread or just starts the loop that starts running the
program.

Because the actual code for updating fields is part of a separate
class (separate from the GUI) I am not seeing the UI update at all.

I have seen a lot of very simple tutorials on how to make a GUI
responsive, but I'm not seeing two way communications happening. That
is, I need to grab values from the text entry fields, process them,
and then update the text entry fields with the new values.

I'm most likely just being very dense here, and I'm finding it very
difficult to wrap my mind around how this works. I think I understand
that if the user was editing the fields I could attach callbacks for
the fields, but since it's the program editing the fields I'm just not
making the connection (literally :) in how this works.

The interface was designed in Glade and perhaps there are some
properties there that I've set incorrectly that are hindering my attempts.

Any pointers/references that you can point me to would be *greatly*
appreciated.

I don't have any previous experience with using GTK in C or C++.

Thank you.

Ken
