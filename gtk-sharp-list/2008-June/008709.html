</I>That's a problem - I *have* looked at that and I'm just not making the
connection. For what you understand of my application, which one of
those approaches would make most sense?

To restate: I need to pull information from the widgets *and* then
update them.  I think I understand how the signal/callback works if I
am interacting with the widgets, I just don't see quite how it works
if it's the program that needs to update them.

The main reason for looking at it being threaded is solely to get the
responsiveness. Perhaps I'd be better off making all the form elements
be part of a class and then just pass the instance (or make it
&quot;global&quot;) and leave it all in one thread.

I'll have to eventually sort out the threading issue for other projects.

Can you recommend any resources that show examples of threaded GUI
interaction? So far all the tutorial articles I've seen either have a
very limited, partially implemented example or they're very simple
interactions between a button and a static label sort of thing.

Thanks for your reply - I'll take another look and see if I can sort
it out some more.
