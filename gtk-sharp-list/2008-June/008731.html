Hi

I'm using monodevelop, and I have a treeview that needs to support multiple
selections, and a popup menu.

I dont really want to make my own custom treeview and override OnButtonPress
if I can avoid it, as I use monodevelop and it'd be a lot cleaner for me to
keep the ui in the ui designer.

I've tried a few different solutions to work around this problem, mostly
[ConnectBefore] on my OnTreeviewButtonPress, and then a function that's
called immediatly to update the selected treeview based on
ButtonPressEventArgs, but this seems awfully hackish, and isn't reliable
(and since I switched to MultipleSelect, not really working at all).

Does anyone have any similar functions?  Preferably something that works, I
just want to be able to get the currently selected rows from my
OnTreeviewButtonPressEvent.

Is there any clean way of implementing a popup menu in a treeview when you
need to know the selection?  I've googled for hours now, and everything I
find is a ton of fairly hackish code.
