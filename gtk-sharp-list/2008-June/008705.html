<PRE>&gt;<i> on interactive applications.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't have any previous experience with using GTK in C or C++.
</I>
I came to GTK# from the same place so don't feel too bad.  Last time I'd
done any GUI programming was with Borland's OWL toolkit on Windows For
Workgroups.  :)

&gt;<i> Basically, there are a lot of fields (you can see an image at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://quarter-flash.com/powerball.png">http://quarter-flash.com/powerball.png</A>) and the [Play] button kicks
</I>&gt;<i> off either a thread or just starts the loop that starts running the
</I>&gt;<i> program.
</I>&gt;<i> Because the actual code for updating fields is part of a separate
</I>&gt;<i> class (separate from the GUI) I am not seeing the UI update at all.
</I>
I assume your Window / Dialog with the form fields is a class?  Just
expose the fields as properties might be the simplest way.

...
public string Jackpot { set { jackpot.Text = value; } }
...

That should update the value in the field.  Have your command class call
that method of your Window/Dialog/Form class.

&gt;<i> I have seen a lot of very simple tutorials on how to make a GUI
</I>&gt;<i> responsive, but I'm not seeing two way communications happening. That
</I>&gt;<i> is, I need to grab values from the text entry fields, process them,
</I>&gt;<i> and then update the text entry fields with the new values.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm most likely just being very dense here, and I'm finding it very
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to wrap my mind around how this works. I think I understand
</I>&gt;<i> that if the user was editing the fields I could attach callbacks for
</I>&gt;<i> the fields, but since it's the program editing the fields I'm just not
</I>&gt;<i> making the connection (literally :) in how this works.
</I>
You can either update the field whenever the value is changed by the
calculation or call a Timer to refresh the values from the command
class.

&gt;<i> The interface was designed in Glade and perhaps there are some
</I>&gt;<i> properties there that I've set incorrectly that are hindering my attempts.
</I>&gt;<i> Any pointers/references that you can point me to would be *greatly*
</I>&gt;<i> appreciated.
