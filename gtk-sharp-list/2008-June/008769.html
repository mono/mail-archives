I tried telepathy-glib-sharp and see some obvious problems.  You are
setting up the parser source file to scan the installed headers.  This
isn't going to work, since the parser also needs to scan the source
files to get at things like class init funcs and type initializations.

The typical approach for GAPI projects is to set a makefile target to
download a source tarball to be used by the make api target and to
configure your parse to access the sources from the downloaded and
extracted target.  You can see examples of this in the gtk-sharp/sources
directory where the gapi2-parser step is performed in Gtk#.

Unless you have a good reason to vary from the typical project layout, I
would recommend sticking to it.  This project layout is fairly well
described on:
