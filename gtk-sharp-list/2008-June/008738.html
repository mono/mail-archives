<PRE>Hello,

I use GTK# (2.10.4 I think) in my project that I am trying to distribute
over the net.  I am having a really hard time with GTK, seems like for some
percentage of the people who install my app there is a problem with GTK
which prevents the program from launching.  I am really at a loss over what
to do.  I am using a GTK# installer which I built from here:
<A HREF="http://medsphere.org/projects/gtksharp/svn/trunk">http://medsphere.org/projects/gtksharp/svn/trunk</A> . I am doing this because I
need 2.10.4 because 2.10.3 has a known issue with TreevViews that was fixed
in 2.10.4.  On my machine and every machine I can get my hands on there
isn't a problem, but I know the situation does exist because I have 3
tickets about it, and I know how tricky it is to get my app to find GTK,
even on my machine.  This is the info that I have from their crashes,
<A HREF="http://dialect.openmodeling.net/report/1">http://dialect.openmodeling.net/report/1</A> if anyone can help I would really
appreciate it, I do not know what to do in order to make sure that my app
can find GTK.

Billy
