Hello 

I didn't know where to post it so, since I'm on linux, this section seemed
appropriate. If not, my apologies. 

I am running SMath Studio in ubuntu (previously Karmic, now Lucid) and there
seems to be a strange behavior (for me): special characters like &#259;&#351;&#355;&#238;&#226; don't
show in tooltips or dialogs, but they do in menus and main program. Below is
a small screenshot: 

<A HREF="http://i42.tinypic.com/efs8kk.png">http://i42.tinypic.com/efs8kk.png</A>
(it seems that at the preview of the message, nabble deleted the picture;
instead, I'm posting the link to it) 

It can be seen that the same character, &#259;, is displayed correctly in
&quot;Aritmetic&#259;&quot; (up, main program), but not in &quot;Num&#259;r&quot; (tooltip). 
I tried various approaches: changing locale to CP1250, ISO-8859-2, running
the program with &quot;LC_ALL=&lt;codepage&gt; mono xxx.exe&quot;, changing the translation
file to CP1250 and ISO8859-2 from UTF-8 (that says: &quot;falling back to C
locale&quot;, but the menu characters are still OK), grabbing the sources from
the main page and recompiling them (Ubuntu has 2.4) because the developer of
SMath showed me a screenshot of the program running in openSuse 11 (which
has 2.6), and it works for him. But, nothing. Searching the internet only
showed me the locale approach, and in the forums, here, got me to this
closest result. But, since I am not compiling any program... 
The tries have been in Karmic and Lucid (except compiling, in Lucid). I
posted in the Ubuntu forums, thinking that it may be a problem with their
packages. I'm posting here, too, thinking that you know more about mono than
anyone else. 
Now I'm left staring at the squares with no solution and it's a bit
frustrating to know that there is one but I cant see it. I even bet it's a
simple one right under my nose. However it is, I'm stuck and asking for
help. So, if anyone thinks that can help, please do. 

Anticipated thanks, 
Vlad.
