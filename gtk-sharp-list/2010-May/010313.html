I'm making a custom widget which contains an Image widget but allows the
image's size to grow and shrink as the widget is resized. The problem is
that I can't find an appropriate event to do this on.

I tried to use the Expose event, but as changing the Image widget's pixbuf
forces it to be redrawn, the Expose event runs again, producing a sort of
infinite loop.

I tried the Configure event, which supposedly is fired whenever the widget
is resized or moved but it doesn't get fired at all (even if I use
[Glib.ConnectBefore]).

I tried the SizeRequest event, but it seems it only runs one in the
beginning and then never again even if the widget is resized.

How do you think I should do this? Is there another event which is more
appropriate, or a way to solve the problem of one of these three events?
