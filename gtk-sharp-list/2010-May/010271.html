<PRE>
I am writing an application that needs to run some code when the app first
starts up. I would prefer this code to run after Gtk.Application.Run() is
called, but I have not found a way to detect when the main loop has started.

The code should run after the main loop has started because it is capable of
calling Application.Quit if there is a problem, and this doesn't seem to
work if Application.Run has not been called first.

I was hoping there was an event I could listen for from Gtk.Application that
is fired when the main loop starts, or even a property I could check (like
Gtk.Application.IsRunning) from a background thread before running this
code, but I haven't had any luck finding something along those lines.

Could someone provide some insight into how to approach this? Is there a way
to accomplish what I am after, or is there a better approach to use? Any
input would be appreciated.
