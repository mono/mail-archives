<PRE>I have an application that uses GTK#, and links to GTK# libraries that have
been JIT compiled. The GTK# libraries are JIT compiled because the packages
that my GNU/Linux distribution (Debian) provides are JIT compiled. I
explicitly compile my application as a 32-bit binary because another
dependency I have provides 32 and 64 bit releases. This is a 32 bit
distirubiton of my application.

Without GTK# everything runs fine since every library I linked against is a
32 bit binary. When adding GTK#, the application crashes upon looking for
gtk-sharp.dll because it looks for a 64 bit library due to being linked
against JIT compiled GTK# libraries. Replacing gtk-sharp.dll and the rest of
the *-sharp.dll libraries with JIT compiled ones fixes the issue, but then
the application crashes upon calling Gtk.Object.gtk_object_destroy(IntPtr
raw). I am guessing that it is unable to use one of the windows specific 32
bit libraries provided by the mono windows installer because the app is
linked against JIT binaries.

Is there any way I can tell the application to look for 32 bit libraries
rather then the platform architecture?

Do I need to somehow compile 32 bit gtk-sharp libraries and link against
those?

Right now I am trying to keep the GTK# libraries in the same folder as the
application so the user does not have to install GTK#.
