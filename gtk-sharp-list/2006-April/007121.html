Will it work with a common base class? If so, I guess interfaces will
work too. I don't know, but I doubt it. According to MSDN, MemberInfo
classes have a DeclaringType property that is not necessarily the same
type that the MemberInfo was obtained from. However, you can't use the
DeclaringType to get a PropertyInfo from the base type, as any
overridden member is considered to 'redeclare' the member. I poked
around in Mono's class library as well, but stopped when I hit an
internal call.

If it doesn't work, you could require a System.Type in the ListAdaptor
constructor, then use that to get a base PropertyInfo. The System.Type
could then of course be an interface. I think this will work, though I
could be wrong.

GTK# databinding is already on the Mono SoC ideas page:
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/StudentProjects#DataBinding">http://www.mono-project.com/StudentProjects#DataBinding</A>

I'm afraid I'm applying for something else, sorry :(
It would be interesting to collect ideas for GTK# databinding anyway.
Maybe we need a wiki page somewhere.
