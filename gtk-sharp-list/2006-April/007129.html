Probably, indeed.

I agree. But it's not something I can at this moment spend my time on.
But I would like the idea of implementing the ComponentModel stuff in
Gtk#. I once started, I would very likely help out implementing bits and
bytes.

&gt;<i> I think it's good to pursue this is an external project for now as you
</I>&gt;<i> are doing.  The majority of the code should probably be
</I>&gt;<i> internal/non-public API with the exception of the
</I>&gt;<i> DataSource/Field/etc... API.  With proper planning, it should be
</I>&gt;<i> possible to develop as a standalone project to be merged into Gtk# when
</I>&gt;<i> it matures.  Of course, since I'll have to maintain it going forward, it
</I>&gt;<i> will need to meet the standards that typically apply: coding standards,
</I>&gt;<i> readability, etc...
</I>
When the time is ripe, I propose doing it in a new namespace and in a
different assembly. Perhaps shouldn't it be called Gtk#: Because it
would introduce drastic changes to the way developers have to look at
Gtk+ development in .NET. Those changes wouldn't be (at all) compatible
with the API documentation of the C Gtk+ API anymore. Nor I think should
Gtk# be very different from the C/Object Gtk+ API.

Whether or not the C/Gobject Gtk+ API is &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; isn't something
the 1-1 bindings should fix. However, an library/assembly that imple-
ments a bunch of adapters isn't an ugly solution in my humble opinion.

So .. in a new project/assembly/library/namespace and on-top-of.

&gt;<i> I'll follow your efforts as closely as I can and give feedback.  Please
</I>&gt;<i> keep us posted.
</I>
Will do.
