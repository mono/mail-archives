As I see you already did.

Noticed that, but still worked a wonder for me:) I was right on the start of
applying few treeviews with complex data. So this was a real life saver. This is
the least I could do back for my new gained time:)

&gt;<i> Let me know. It's a mod_svn so I can apply any type of Apache2 authent-

I see no prob here. I'm prepared to do my share of work on this one. Especialy
if this would have a chance to get in regular gtk-sharp TreeView (or if the
mainters decide what kind of Databindings they prefer).

If anything matters, I did another patch, but I'm not on my computer right now
so I can't send it right now, I didn't expect that childish patch would be taken
in consideration so soon (and if it even would).

Second patch is restoring the state of treeview after same datasource has been
applied again. Restoring position and selections. Only one problem with that
patch, I can't get rid of flicker in treeview on restore (redrawing start and
then changing position with another redraw). Doing
treeviewobject.GdkWindow.FreezeUpdates() and
treeviewobject.GdkWindow.ThawUpdates() doesn't seem to help here either (any
idea is appreciated). Have to look more than 15 minutes as I did so far.

I plan to try making the same thing for Combo.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry I had to modify lib locations too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I hardcoded the library locations because I don't really understand that
</I>&gt;<i> Mono trick you have to do to translate Win32 DLL locations to UNIX so
</I>&gt;<i> file locations.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Don't know much about that one too. I don't touch Windows with a ten foot pole.
This is why I like mono and gtk-sharp. Same results everywhere.

&gt;<i> I improved it a little bit. Except that I've left the .so extension and
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;-x11&quot; thingy of gtk+ in tact. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Saw that.

&gt;<i> Some guy who's experienced in P/Invoke should really or document it or
</I>&gt;<i> create me such a config file that will work everywhere ;-). I'm happy to
</I>&gt;<i> accept both patches and commits for the experiment.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Can't help here:( As I said, no Windows.
