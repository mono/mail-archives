Hey Mike, easy dude ;-). As you said, indeed, at this moment it's just a
prove of concept.

But I'm totally open about contributions and ideas here. If you want to
change the idea, turn it upside down and stuff like that: I'll even give
you commit access to the Subversion so that you can tryout things.

I don't know at which point I'll hit the hard limits of the C-isms of
the Gtk+ API. I don't know how easy it will be to also make it sortable
in a typical .NET fashion. I think it should already be sortable, as in
essence ListAdaptor is a very typical GtkTreeModelIface. I think it
should work, I'm just afraid of testing it :-D. I fear my computer will
start throwing its keys in my eyes because I'm tying to do crazy stuff
for which its hardware isn't designed, it thinks.

&gt;<i> Would it be possible to implement this a completely self-contained
</I>&gt;<i> TreeModel (maybe a MappingTreemodel) without a need for a
</I>&gt;<i> TreeViewAdaptor? Something that just performs mappings? Maybe even
</I>&gt;<i> allow delegates for custom mappings?
</I>
Well, the Banshee dude is implementing a TreeView in C# (*). Such an
implementation could do it. If you want to use the GtkTreeView (the C
GObject type), I think the only way is to wrap the IList in an adaptor
that also implements GtkTreeModelIface (the C GTypeInterface).

&gt;<i> Really good work anyway; I've always been uncomfortable about having
</I>&gt;<i> to use a specialised model for TreeView, even with the NodeStore.
</I>
Same here. Now you can use the view component in a typical .NET fashion.

I'm planning to test writable cells. It should work if I add some code.
It will be basically doing a pi.SetValue (instance, value, null) upon
writing. It should be as possible as reading the value (which is atm
using the pi.GetValue (instance, null) reflection stuff.

If somebody is interested: go ahead dude ;-). Improve this prove of
concept. That's why I posted it.
