<PRE>Well, it's an approach, and that's what I'm looking for.

My perspective is something like Visio. The road map is an image, the
background of a &quot;canvas&quot; or a &quot;grid&quot;, which I'll call map from now. Then
I would have a toolbar with my buttons, each one representing some
object. When drag n' dropped into that map, it would instantiate the
connected object and store the coordinates in the map, and the variables
I which to save.

I'm splitting the problem in two: the app and the app gui! I'm
developing the app &quot;forgetting&quot; the gui, but then I'll have to link the
gui to the core, so there is the needed interaction.

I'm trying to get as much different ideas as I can, so I can decide
better which way to take. But my main issue is what GTK# widgets to use
to get this going.


Many thanks for your tip
Paulo Pires

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am developing  a Traffic Control Management System, which 1st version

&gt;<i> &gt; (like speed-measurers) in image format. Each control (image) can be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; selected and deleted/moved at anytime and I must know which control is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; selected, since each one of them will have different configurations
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (such as timing, state, etc). After everything is configured, there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should be a &quot;simulator&quot;, which, following the configurations for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; several controls, will demonstrate the &quot;real&quot; project behavior.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The question here is that I'm willing to deploy it in GTK#, and I've
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; never worked, at this level, with GTK (or other GUI besides VB :$). I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; following GTK# since September but I feel like it's not enough for my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; task.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've got Edd &amp; Niel's book &quot;Mono - A Developer's Notebook&quot; and I think
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that my solution is probably around DrawingArea but I have serious
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; issues, like i don't want to renderize my work into one single image. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; want to work images (controls) independantly.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would really appreciate some enlightenment about which is the best
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; approach, for you guys, to get this going.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I really don't want to get back to VB to get this project on
