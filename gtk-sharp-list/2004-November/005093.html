<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; =20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So I then dug further to find the developer tools.  Gtk#=20
</I>&gt;<i> turns out to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be the Open Source version of C# right?
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> Not so much, Gtk# is comparable with Microsoft .NET Framework=20
</I>&gt;<i> WinForms=20
</I>&gt;<i> toolkit for creating rich client GUI applications.  Gtk# is=20
</I>&gt;<i> written in C#.
</I>So that means you use Gtk# to add a GUI for apps written with some other
tool?  Can one develop complete applications with Gtk# that can access a
database or is that not what its for?

&gt;<i> &gt; =20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Downloaded that, but now it says it wants the MS .NET SDK=20
</I>&gt;<i> 1.1 ?  So I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; looked it up but it's a large download and I don't have a lot of=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bandwidth where I'm at at the moment.
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, even though our SDK and Runtime are much=20
</I>&gt;<i> smaller than the MS counter parts, they still have to be=20
</I>&gt;<i> measured in mega bytes (in the case of the combined installer
</I>&gt;<i> , dozen of mega bytes). =20
</I>Which is this SDK and where can I read more about it?

&gt;<i> However if you need GTK+ you will have it bundle with the=20
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate installer.  If you are willing to use a text=20
</I>&gt;<i> editor or an IDE like SharpDevelop you may be able to=20
</I>&gt;<i> forgo the MS .NET SDK when developing Mono applications \
</I>&gt;<i> with the Mono Combined installer.
</I>Why would I need Gtk+?  Does it do more than Gtk#.  Would you mind
explaining briefly?

&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; =20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is there somewhere where I can read a basic desciption of=20
</I>&gt;<i> how this all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; works.  I'm still very much used to the MS way of doing=20
</I>&gt;<i> something, so=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I need some help here.  The webpages I found don't help much.
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> I may have some blog entries that may help you get a better=20
</I>&gt;<i> picture of=20
</I>&gt;<i> how some of the Mono and Gtk# technologies fit and interact=20
</I>&gt;<i> with Win32. =20
</I>&gt;<i> The link below is a somewhat older entry but may be worth=20
</I>&gt;<i> wile. <A HREF="http://www.mfconsulting.com/blog/archives/000041.html">http://www.mfconsulting.com/blog/archives/000041.html</A>
</I>I'm a bit snowed under at the moment, but I will read it in the next few
days.

Lastly, if I'm looking for an Open Source equivalent for Visual Studio =
.net,
is there anything available (even if I have to use a combination of
apps/IDEs/whatever?

Thanks again

Roland

PS. I'm seriously considering doing a fairly large development in an =
Open
Source environment.  I'm a fairly proficient programmer (B.Sc Computer
Science), but have worked only really in VB, lots of JavaScript/XML/VBS,
Fortran, PL/1 and quite a few other ancient languages.  Would you say =
I'm
doing the right thing by looking at Gtk#/Mono?
