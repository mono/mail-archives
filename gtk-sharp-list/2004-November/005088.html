Not so much, Gtk# is comparable with Microsoft .NET Framework WinForms 
toolkit for creating rich client GUI applications.  Gtk# is written in C#.

&gt;<i>

Unfortunately, even though our SDK and Runtime are much smaller than the 
MS counter parts, they still have to be measured in mega bytes (in the 
case of the combined installer, dozen of mega bytes).  However if you 
need GTK+ you will have it bundle with the appropriate installer.  If 
you are willing to use a text editor or an IDE like SharpDevelop you may 
be able to forgo the MS .NET SDK when developing Mono applications with 
the Mono Combined installer.

&gt;<i>

I may have some blog entries that may help you get a better picture of 
how some of the Mono and Gtk# technologies fit and interact with Win32.  
The link below is a somewhat older entry but may be worth wile.
