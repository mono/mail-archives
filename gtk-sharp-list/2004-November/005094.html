&gt;<i> &gt; Not so much, Gtk# is comparable with Microsoft .NET Framework
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; WinForms
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; toolkit for creating rich client GUI applications.  Gtk# is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; written in C#.
</I>&gt;<i> So that means you use Gtk# to add a GUI for apps written with some other
</I>&gt;<i> tool?  Can one develop complete applications with Gtk# that can access a
</I>&gt;<i> database or is that not what its for?
</I>
A good example is this: You can write console programs in VB.  If you
use the WinForms toolkit you can also create GUI applications in VB.

Likewise, you can write Console programs in C#.  If you use WinForms
or Gtk# or one of the other gui toolkits you can also create graphical
programs.

Which gui toolkit you use depends on your needs.  Gtk# is nice because
it works on many platforms, not just Windows.  However, choosing a
toolkit is very important and you should look at the pros and cons of
each toolkit to decide which you want to make a commitment to.

If you're going to make database applications, make sure you choose a
toolkit that will meet your printing needs, if you'll be creating
reports. So far I have not found any cross-platform printing
solutions. I've seen some that work well only on windows and others
that work well only on *nix.

BTW, Yes, you can create DB applications with Gtk#.

&gt;<i> &gt; However if you need GTK+ you will have it bundle with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; appropriate installer.  If you are willing to use a text
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; editor or an IDE like SharpDevelop you may be able to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; forgo the MS .NET SDK when developing Mono applications \
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with the Mono Combined installer.
</I>&gt;<i> Why would I need Gtk+?  Does it do more than Gtk#.  Would you mind
</I>&gt;<i> explaining briefly?
</I>
Gtk+ is a C (not C#) gui toolkit. It has been around for some time and
is cross platform and mature. Gtk# is the Gtk+ toolkit usable from C#
programs. So, if you use C you use Gtk+, if you use C# you use Gtk#.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Is there somewhere where I can read a basic desciption of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how this all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; works.  I'm still very much used to the MS way of doing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something, so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I need some help here.  The webpages I found don't help much.
</I>
I too am an experienced programmer and I found the book, &quot;Mono
Developer's Handbook&quot; to be phenominal. It is written with programmers
in mind and spends a lot of time talking about writting graphical
programs with Gtk#.

&gt;<i> Lastly, if I'm looking for an Open Source equivalent for Visual Studio .net,
</I>&gt;<i> is there anything available (even if I have to use a combination of
</I>&gt;<i> apps/IDEs/whatever?
</I>
In Windows I use SharpDevelop (www.icsharpcode.com) but it favors the
WinForms toolkit.  You can tweak it to help you in your Gtk#
development but there is no GUI builder such as VB if you choose Gtk#
as your gui toolkit with SharpDevelop.

If you are on Linux, check out MonoDevelop, a port of SharpDevelop
that is being tailored specifically to Gtk# developers.

If you want a VB like form building experience, the most mature tool
I've seen is glade. I believe it works with C#. It has a lot of
similarities with the drag-and-drop tools of VB but it is also a bit
different in the way it works, so allow some time to get used to it.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PS. I'm seriously considering doing a fairly large development in an Open
</I>&gt;<i> Source environment.  I'm a fairly proficient programmer (B.Sc Computer
</I>&gt;<i> Science), but have worked only really in VB, lots of JavaScript/XML/VBS,
</I>&gt;<i> Fortran, PL/1 and quite a few other ancient languages.  Would you say I'm
</I>&gt;<i> doing the right thing by looking at Gtk#/Mono?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I just finished my first Mono based project, which is only my 2nd C#
project.  I'll say that the end result is 25 - 100 times faster than
what it replaced, a PHP/Stored Procedure based program.

Another thing to consider is your target audience.  If your users are
windows, be aware that Gtk programs feel just a little different than
other windows programs.  Check out gaim (<A HREF="http://gaim.sf.net">http://gaim.sf.net</A>) and
you'll see what I mean. It's a very functional and usable toolkit;
it's just a little different.

If you really need cross-platform, the only good choices I know that
are opensource are Gtk# and Wx#.

If you are developing for Linux/Gnome environment then Gtk# is the
best choice I believe.

Of course, these are my opinions and I'm a new subscriber to the Gtk#
mailing list.
