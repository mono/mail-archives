<PRE>I think a simpler approach might work, but I may be wrong (happens all
the time :).

The traffic lights, etc can (on screen) probably be simple widgets, like
buttons (they can have images). You create them, and can move them etc.
You may want to keep a list or something with all of them too.

I'm not sure if you're getting the map as an already drawn figure, or as
one you draw. If it's already drawn, then displaying it is simple (again
a button or something). If you have to draw it, you may use DrawingArea,
or just a bunch of widgets again. 

How are you representing your map ? is there a grid ? if so, then you
can just use a widget per cell, and change the image depending on  what
the widget is.

Would something like this work ? is this too simple ?
