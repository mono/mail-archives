<PRE>hi,

i try do write a programm that runs under linux and windows. i'm 
developing under windows with sharpdevelop and c#. therefore i installed 
gtk# for windows. my program should draw a few rectangels and stuff like 
that. therefore i'm &quot;using Gtk;&quot; and this offers me something called 
&quot;DrawingArea&quot;. i have this add to my window, but this drawingarea doen't 
support any funktions like drawRectangle!? how can i draw some 
rectangles with drawingarea?

my second solution (but i think its netter to use Gtk) is to use Gdk. if 
i make an instant of Gdk.Window this instant has functions like 
drawRectangle... but i can't use them, because i can not build a window. 
the constructor for new Gdk.Windw(x,y,z) need a parent window. but my 
program should only have one window i can not tell my programm that 
there is only one window (itself) that i would like to have. and so i 
can't create my window. :-(

at the end an other short stupid question: there are a many libarys 
(atk, pango, gdk,...) what are they for? i think it should be enough to 
use Gtk?

thank a lot, thomas
