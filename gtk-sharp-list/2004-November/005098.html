<PRE>Briefly...

1 - Mono is an open implementation of the Microsoft .NET framework.
2 - GTK# is C# bindings for GTK+, which can be embedded into C# code in
order to your app run a graphical mode.

.NET brings much more than C# (programming languange, C-Sharp) and a GUI
system known as System.Window.Forms (those nasty Windows graphics) and
Mono supports it as well. GTK# is a GUI system, with the very famous GTK
+ as its &quot;parent&quot;, GTK+ is a main part of Gnome.

So I guess you are really confused.

Now, how can you develop an app using GTK# GUI? Well you can get
Mono-installer (available at Mono site) and run your apps over it, on
Windows, Linux or MacOS (I guess there are ports for other OSes too). Or
you can get the gtk-sharp into your Microsoft .NET framework.

Check out www.mono-project.com and read carefully.
