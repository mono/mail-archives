Well, there are two options that come to my mind:

1) I think writing your own TreeModel would be the most elegant
solution, but this is an advanced topic, no questions and the details
could be evil, which I'm not aware of specifically.

2) However creating your own stores per views and maintaining them is
probably easier to do, but less elegant and the code is harder to
maintain in the long run.

I'd try 1) and if it doesn't work out, I'd move to 2).

This is all general stuff, of course, but I hope that it helps.
