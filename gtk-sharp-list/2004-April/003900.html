                                         into                MS Visual Studio .NET(Document link: Richard Staff)   
                                                                                                                   



libgtk-win32-2.0-0.dll is calling libiconv_set_relocation_prefix, which is
supposed to reside inside iconv.dll.
libgtk-win32-2.0-0.dll appears to be calling a lot of things during startup
that support GtkButton.exe.
There were a lot of not found DLL's that I was able to track down and fix,
but this iconv.dll appears to be missing a method that
libgtk-win32-2.0-0.dll wants to use.  Oh well.

P.S.  What are  #mono or #monodevelop?

&gt;<i> P.S. I tried using the mono GTK# iconv.dll as an assembly reference, MS

I had a similar problem with (if I remember correctly) gdl-sharp.dll. I'm
not at my XP box at the moment, so I can't look to see how I resolved
that, but I'll get back to you.

What is it that requires iconv.dll? The file doesn't ring any bells for me
- is it required for the code snippet you sent earlier?

PS: If you hang around #mono or #monodevelop after midnight CST, I can try
to help you out with vs.net handy.
