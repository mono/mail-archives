Sorry, I didn't mean to sound terse.

Done.

&gt;<i> So, thanks again for your patch, but please be more patient in the

Yes, you're quite right. I was a bit quick on the trigger after a couple
of other projects I've submitted patches for and never received
approval. It's good to see this isn't one of them.

Cheers,
Owen
