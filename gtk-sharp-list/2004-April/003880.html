Cool, I had just looked at it the other day when 0.8.1 came out and it
seems to be much better on the parser than 0.8.  You still had to modify
the source for it to parse cleanly correct?  One thing that was
discussed is moving gstreamer-sharp to its own module given that its
been rather unstable and is now going to be targeting a version that is
much newer than the rest of Gtk#, but I'm ok with either place.  Also,
by working do you mean you are able to fully use it to play music or
video, or compiling only?

It may be best if you can post the gstreamer specific stuff somewhere
also or at least detail the changes a bit more, so it can be approved to
go into cvs, but thats not my call.
