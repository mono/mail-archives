Thanks for the patch.

For future reference, this is not how commit priviledges work. Explicit
patch approval from the module maintainer is required for committing
code to mono cvs in all modules, unless the maintainer tells you
otherwise.

I know this was a small patch, but unfortunately you can't expect a
maintainer to comment on all patches within 24 hours.  Most of us are
very busy working on the Beta1 release ATM, for example.  I was planning
on approving you patch today after I merged it up and built it. 
However, my approval message to you would have specified that you
provide a ChangeLog entry with your commit, which you didn't do.  Please
commit one when you get a chance.

So, thanks again for your patch, but please be more patient in the
future waiting for patch approvals.  Just so you know, I plan to comment
on your generator patch for the gstreamer binding this afternoon.
