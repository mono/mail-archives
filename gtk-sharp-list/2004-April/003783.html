I'm not sure that is enough of an improvement to warrant differing from
the GTK+ name, but it could be done depending on what everyone thinks.
I just think you are the first to propose it.  For others
(constructively) criticizing the API and names is helpful so do so when
you notice things like that.

&gt;<i> 	Why do none of the Atk interfaces have I in front of their names even
</I>&gt;<i> though the convention is used throughout the rest of Gtk#?
</I>
I don't think the generator is prefixing I on interfaces at all is it?
The only one in Gtk is ITreeNode which was hand written.
I believe this was discussed and/or planned at one time but I can't
remember what was decided.
