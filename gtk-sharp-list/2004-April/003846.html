I've been looking into creating designer functionality for Gtk# similar 
to the designers for Windows.Forms. (ultimately for creating a plugin 
for monodevelop)  I've been creating a control at work and have been 
learning a lot about the various .Componentmodel and .Design namespaces.

I know that Glade is out there for designing Gtk, but using the 
&quot;standard&quot; way of using CodeDom serialization as Windows.Forms does 
would probably help the transition from someone coming from 
Windows.Forms to Gtk#.

The only issue I've seen so far is that Windows.Forms specific stuff is 
mixed in with the .Design namespaces.  Perhaps we could implement our 
own .Design namespaces for Gtk# as well as the Windows.Forms version?
