<PRE>Hi,

thank you very much for your work. I think there are a lot of people
(like me) that want to use gst-sharp. I tried some months ago to get it
working, but I didn't reached it. 

Where did you committed the patch finally? 

Jorge

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, the thought occurred to me too. I guess it really belongs in its

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also,

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've played music using it. I haven't tested video but I expect if there

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It may be best if you can post the gstreamer specific stuff somewhere
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; also or at least detail the changes a bit more, so it can be approved to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; go into cvs, but thats not my call.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The changes in the gst directory are a bit extensive to post as a patch
</I>&gt;<i> but if I can create a new module then that can be examined before
</I>&gt;<i> removing the existing code from the gtk-sharp tree.
