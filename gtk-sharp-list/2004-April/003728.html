The problem with scribble and glade was (to put it in my own words/not
knowing how to describe it clearly) that the events didn't get connected
the right way?
I mean, for example, that there is an event in scribble called
&quot;ConfigureEvent&quot; that should create the pixmap and paint it with a white
background.
So it doesn't get called or the parameters aren't the right? I guess
thats why it kills with a NullPointerException.
I did both ways, configuring the events in glade and/or connecting them
in scribble. Neither worked.

I've found a solution for the thing i wanted to do. (just loading a
glade file with a drawingarea and paint to them.)

Then you do create the pixmap outsite of the events in scribble it won't
fail to run, but it doesn't draw anything.
You could draw to them by hand, but not with the created events.

So i hope this helps so far, maybe you or someone else does have a
better idea?! (Maybe it has something to do with the [ConnectBefore]
stuff???)

Btw.: Is there a chance to see the libgnomeprint/ui stuff for c# (gtk#)
someday? I mean i would like to port the gnome-photo-printer stuff i
worked on before to c#/gtk#.

Sebastian Vorköper
