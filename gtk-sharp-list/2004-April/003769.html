<PRE>Hey,

	Ben has just finished explaining to me that you are planning on
accepting his patch to remove the need for the GType stuff. While I do
completely support this patch, and would love to see it in CVS, he has
told me that it will be committed in a form that breaks '300 ctors' (his
words). Why is this even being considered?! I understand that cvs is a
place for some breakage to occur, but to check in code with a huge known
issue like this seems insane.

	Please, at the very least fix all the common usages before committing
this patch, as setting an acceptable precedent for that sort of breakage
seems ridiculous. Considering especially that for the last few releases
people have been told over and over again to use the sub-classing and
overriding pattern instead of event attachment.

	Apparently as well, there is no plan to fix all this breakage by 1.0?
That sounds even crazier.

	Am I not understanding something fundamental? Ben hasn't made exactly
what is breaking and why clear, and why it has to happen and why there
is no better way. Any explanation will help. :)
