&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The problem with scribble and glade was (to put it in my own word=
</I>s/not
&gt;<i> &gt; knowing how to describe it clearly) that the events didn't get co=
</I>nnected
&gt;<i> &gt; the right way?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I mean, for example, that there is an event in scribble called
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;ConfigureEvent&quot; that should create the pixmap and paint it with =
</I>a white
&gt;<i> &gt; background.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So it doesn't get called or the parameters aren't the right? I gu=
</I>ess
&gt;<i> &gt; thats why it kills with a NullPointerException.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I did both ways, configuring the events in glade and/or connectin=
</I>g them
&gt;<i> &gt; in scribble. Neither worked.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've found a solution for the thing i wanted to do. (just loading=
</I> a
&gt;<i> &gt; glade file with a drawingarea and paint to them.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Pixmaps do not have the flags set to allow for any interesting even=
</I>ts to
&gt;<i> be received.  See my sample code in mphoto, mlist or monodoc's list=
</I>.cs
&gt;<i> to see how to set the events to be delivered.
</I>
I know, but i'm not talking about events for pixmap's.
I'm talking about the events that get set up for the drawingarea in
scribble.
But anyway i will take a look at tthe suggested sources.

&gt;<i> &gt; Then you do create the pixmap outsite of the events in scribble i=
</I>t won't
&gt;<i> &gt; fail to run, but it doesn't draw anything.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You could draw to them by hand, but not with the created events.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A drawing area has those events setup.
</I>
See above.

&gt;<i> &gt; Btw.: Is there a chance to see the libgnomeprint/ui stuff for c# =
</I>(gtk#)
&gt;<i> &gt; someday? I mean i would like to port the gnome-photo-printer stuf=
</I>f i
&gt;<i> &gt; worked on before to c#/gtk#.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are plenty of gnome_print calls in Gtk# today, did you see th=
</I>em?

Haven't take a look at to much source yet.
So, sorry if the question was a bit to off-topic.

Thanks for the help anyway.

Greetings,
