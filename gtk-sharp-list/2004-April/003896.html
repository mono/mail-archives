<PRE>I had to drop several lib---.dll's into C:\WINNT\system32, and several
*sharp*.dll's into the PublicAssemblies folder before I could compile and
attempt a run.
An error message box popped up with the following title: &quot;GtkButton - Entry
Point Not Found&quot;.  The detailed error message in the popup was &quot;The
procedure libiconv_set_relocation_prefix could not be located in the
dynamic link library iconv.dll.&quot;
iconv.dll is an already existing .NET Framework DLL, and I definitely do
not want to replace it with GTK's thru a dumb drag-n-drop move on my
part!!!!!
Here is the source for GtkButton.cs from &quot;Mono Kick Start&quot; by Hans-Jurgens
Schonig &amp; Ewald Geschwinde, page 238.
//
using Gtk;
using GtkSharp;
using System;
using System.Drawing;

public class MyButton
{
  public static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Application.Init();
    Window win = new Window(&quot;My first button&quot;);
    win.DefaultSize = new Size(200, 200);
    Button btn = new Button(&quot;Click&quot;);
    win.ShowAll();
    Application.Run();
  }
}
//
Suggestions?  Rick  :-(

You can use GTK# under the MS runtime just fine. I've found this works
really well on a VS.net machine as it allows you to use VS.net for your
GTK# development (intellisense, etc.) and debugging. You can even grab a
win32 copy of glade and use it for interface design. I've spent a few
hours attempting to make a GTK# interface designer addin for Visual
Studio, but I haven't made much progress - it's not as usable as glade,
but glade works pretty slick. :)

If you have any questions about GTK# under vs.net, send me a message.
There are a few gotchas you might find yourself working around.
