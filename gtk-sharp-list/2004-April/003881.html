<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Cool, I had just looked at it the other day when 0.8.1 came out and it
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be much better on the parser than 0.8.  You still had to modify
</I>&gt;<i> the source for it to parse cleanly correct?  
</I>
Yes, I've generated a new patch against v0.8.1. Actually, I'm going to
submit that patch to the gstreamer camp as I believe all the things the
parser snagged on were really faults in the gstreamer source.

&gt;<i> One thing that was
</I>&gt;<i> discussed is moving gstreamer-sharp to its own module given that its
</I>&gt;<i> been rather unstable and is now going to be targeting a version that is
</I>&gt;<i> much newer than the rest of Gtk#, but I'm ok with either place.  
</I>
Yeah, the thought occurred to me too. I guess it really belongs in its
own module and if everyone else thinks that's OK I'd be happy to create
that module.

&gt;<i> Also,
</I>&gt;<i> by working do you mean you are able to fully use it to play music or
</I>&gt;<i> video, or compiling only?
</I>
I've played music using it. I haven't tested video but I expect if there
are any problems they wouldn't be hard to right.

&gt;<i> It may be best if you can post the gstreamer specific stuff somewhere
</I>&gt;<i> also or at least detail the changes a bit more, so it can be approved to
</I>&gt;<i> go into cvs, but thats not my call.
</I>
The changes in the gst directory are a bit extensive to post as a patch
but if I can create a new module then that can be examined before
removing the existing code from the gtk-sharp tree.

Cheers,
Owen
