Thanks for the reply. Doing a search on my system reports that the only
file with glue even in the name is

C:\Program Files\Mono-0.31\lib\gtksharpglue.dll

I've never done anything but install everything into the standard
directories. 

So it seems the necessary files don't even exist on my system right now.
How could this have happened (I've used the windows installers from the
webpage), and more importantly then, how can i remedy this?

Thanks again,
Britt
