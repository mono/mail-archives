<PRE>I'm using Gtk# 0.18-2 on Debian.  I'm trying to write
a custom CellRenderer but not having much luck.

When I derive from CellRenderer or CellRendererText
and try to implement a simple GetSize or Activate
method, my methods don't get called.

Since this is a problem with other Gtk+ bindings
(e.g., it doesn't work in PyGtk either), I was
wondering whether this is supposed to work at all--is
it possible to implement custom CellRenderers in
Mono/Gtk#?  Is there some trick to it other than doing
the obvious--deriving from CellRenderer? 

Either way, the CellRenderer documentation should
probably have a sentence saying something like &quot;you
can't currently...&quot; or &quot;in order to make a custom cell
renderer use...&quot;, since that is the primary function
of the CellRenderer class.

Of course, if anybody has an actual, working example
of a custom CellRenderer class implemented in
Mono/Gtk#, that would be even better.  Looking at the
Gtkmm and Gtk+ examples didn't help in this case.

Thanks.
