It's a matter of opinion, I suppose.  IMHO, one of the advantages of
using bindings is that you get an API that seems to be native to the
language.  Naming of classes is part of the that..

&gt;<i> &gt; 	Why do none of the Atk interfaces have I in front of their names even

GLib.IWrapper exists, as well.  Interfaces seem scarce in the Gtk# API. 
I'd be more than happy to file a report and write a patch for the
generator if that's what we want.
