<PRE>nod, after sending the email, the second issue with regard to ctor
chaining was explained to me, and now it all makes sense :)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; words). Why is this even being considered?! I understand that cvs is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; place for some breakage to occur, but to check in code with a huge known
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; issue like this seems insane.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll pause for a moment while you read this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=55694">http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=55694</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Saying that the patch breaks 300 ctors, while dramatic and eye-catching,
</I>&gt;<i> lacks a certain, shall we say, truth.  The scenario that will be broken
</I>&gt;<i> after the patch is currently broken without the patch and documented on
</I>&gt;<i> the above bug report.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One &quot;feature&quot; that will &quot;break&quot; with the patch was only partially broken
</I>&gt;<i> before the patch: the ability to subclass a widget without registering a
</I>&gt;<i> gtype and chaining to a non-default ctor.  An example of this usage is:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> public class MyWindow : Gtk.Window { public MyWindow () : base
</I>&gt;<i> (&quot;MyWindowTitle&quot;) {} }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is currently legal, and will theoretically work unless you ever try
</I>&gt;<i> to use a MyWindow method on an instance ref returned from a Gtk method.
</I>&gt;<i> Gtk# will not be able to wrap the ref as a MyWindow, since there is no
</I>&gt;<i> GType for MyWindow.  It would get wrapped as a Gtk.Window.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, the current situation is broken.  The right way to do it long term
</I>&gt;<i> is to force GType registration for all subclasses so that proper
</I>&gt;<i> wrapping will always occur.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is that with the new silently registered GType scenario,
</I>&gt;<i> chaining to a non-default ctor will not be possible without first
</I>&gt;<i> manually implementing a ctor wrapper. We'll need to call g_object_new on
</I>&gt;<i> the newly registered gtype and pass prop/value pairs to initialize the
</I>&gt;<i> properties which represent the ctor parameters.  The example from the
</I>&gt;<i> above bug is:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> public MyTreeView (NodeStore store) : base (store) {}
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To do this properly, we need (approximately): 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> public TreeView (NodeStore store)
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i> 	if (GetType() != typeof (TreeView) {
</I>&gt;<i> 		GType gtype = RegisterGType (GetType());
</I>&gt;<i> 		Raw = g_object_new (gtype, &quot;store&quot;, new Value (store), IntPtr.Zero);
</I>&gt;<i> 	} else
</I>&gt;<i> 		Raw = gtk_tree_view_new (store.Handle);
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course the patch has more logic to ensure we reuse an already
</I>&gt;<i> registered GType for the new Type, but you get the idea.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would be nice if we could autogenerate the ctors like this, but
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunately, there isn't necessarily a direct mapping of ctor
</I>&gt;<i> parameter to property name.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	Please, at the very least fix all the common usages before committing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this patch, as setting an acceptable precedent for that sort of breakage
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seems ridiculous. Considering especially that for the last few releases
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people have been told over and over again to use the sub-classing and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; overriding pattern instead of event attachment.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I said, it is already broken.  Effectively, this patch just
</I>&gt;<i> advertises that it is broken, by throwing an exception if you try to use
</I>&gt;<i> a non-customized ctor from a subclass.  To reiterate, nobody using the
</I>&gt;<i> existing paradigm of GType boilerplate plus chaining to ctor(GType) will
</I>&gt;<i> be impacted.  I still personally recommend this approach to subclassing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	Apparently as well, there is no plan to fix all this breakage by 1.0?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That sounds even crazier.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, subclassing will not be 100% functional in 1.0.  There
</I>&gt;<i> simply isn't enough time to get it all done.  Another example of known
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;breakage&quot; will be the lack of Virtual methods for GObject class virtual
</I>&gt;<i> methods that don't have an associated signal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You will be able to do a lot with subclassing in 1.0, but it won't be
</I>&gt;<i> fully cooked.  In this case, you'll have to chain to base () and set the
</I>&gt;<i> associated properties in your ctor instead of calling a parametered base
</I>&gt;<i> ctor.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	Am I not understanding something fundamental? Ben hasn't made exactly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what is breaking and why clear, and why it has to happen and why there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is no better way. Any explanation will help. :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm certainly open to suggestions of better ways to solve the joint
</I>&gt;<i> problems of silent type registration and base ctor chaining.  If anyone
</I>&gt;<i> has any bright ideas, speak up so we can shoot holes in them.  ;-)
