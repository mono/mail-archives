<PRE>I know that's a fuzzy question, but it's an important one. Let me
explain: I wrote a small GTK# application on Mac and right away there
are major problems:

-- The first time I click and drag on the resize corner of a window,
nothing happens. On the second attempt, the resize happens.

-- After resizing a window, it will not respond to any mouse clicks.
If I move the window then it will become responsive again.

-- If I scroll within a TextView using the scrollwheel, it displays
overlapping text lines. I have to use the arrow keys to coax the
TextView to redisplay each line correctly.

-- The dock shows &quot;mono&quot; instead of the name of the app and choosing
&quot;Quit&quot; from its menu or the menu bar does not work.

The first three are the real blockers.

I was on the latest Mono 2.4.x and now have Mono 2.6 preview 1 with no
improvement.

If I take the app.exe over to an opensuse install, no problems are present.

I believe that some version of GTK+ is viable because I installed the
gedit for Mac and it looks and works great.

I would like to know if anyone on this list is having success with
GTK# on Mac. Are you seeing these kinds of problems? Do you have an
application running well?
