</I>
At the GNOME summit two years ago, Mike Kestner and I added a makefile
target to gtk-sharp (win32-installer) to allow merge modules to be
built.  This target still exists, and all you need to do is run `make
win32-installer` from a fully built gtk-sharp win32 build to produce a
gtk# msm.

The idea at the time was that Medsphere (who I was working for at the
time) would distribute gtk+ merge modules, and those two combined could
provide the complete gtk# stack.  Now, I'm no longer employed by
Medsphere, so I'm not sure if they still release updated merge modules
along with the general gtk-sharp installer.  Perhaps someone at
Medsphere could speak to this?

Hope this helps,

-Brad
