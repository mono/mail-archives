Dear Chris,

In Linux, separate task bar buttons are appearing for each window when we
are opening multiple windows.
And we should select each by selecting the corresponding buttons.

And in windows XP no separate task buttons are coming. Only one button will
be there for the entire application. While minimizing multiple windows, it
shows only a single taskbar button and we can get individual windows by
clicking on this repeatedly. 

This is wat the code looks like: 	

		//this is for making module window lie on parent

            this.TransientFor = MyClass.MyClassWindow;//parent window
		this.DestroyWithParent = true;
          
When we are testing this code in SUSE SLES-10(x86), it is giving the
unexpected behaviour.

Actually we are here creating new objects of windows(with modal= false)to
accomplish the MDI work around. So a taskbar button for every window is
highly undesirable.

Any help will be highly appreciated,

Thanks,

Libin

What to you mean by &quot;all child windows are comng up like separate separate
applications?&quot;  In terms of functionality and visual appearance, how do they
differ from the Windows implementation?
