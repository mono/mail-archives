Hi Chris,

I tried to solve the problem using  window.SkipTaskbarHint = true, but the
problem in windows is, I cant get back the minimized window without making
another new window as I don't have the taskbar button.

Also in linux the problem of having separate taskbar buttons remains even
after using this code. This taskbar Buttons are actually coming on the
desktop taskbar and not on the parent window.

Earlier In Windows It was working fine with only one taskbar buttonthat too
when minimized it gets minimized on the parent window.I am calling it
taskbar button but when it is minimized it is showing only on the parent
window and not on the windows taskbar.

And In case of linux every window was having a separate taskbar button in
the taskbar itself.

I think the problem in linux is the OS is considering every new window as a
separate process.

Any Inputs about what we could have done wrong here?

Many Thanks,

Libin

Out of curiosity, is there actually only one taskbar button or is the XP
taskbar grouping them?

&gt;<i> This is wat the code looks like:

</I>&gt;<i>                //this is for making module window lie on parent
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>            this.TransientFor = MyClass.MyClassWindow;//parent window
</I>&gt;<i>                this.DestroyWithParent = true;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When we are testing this code in SUSE SLES-10(x86), it is giving the 
</I>&gt;<i> unexpected behaviour.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually we are here creating new objects of windows(with modal= 
</I>&gt;<i> false)to accomplish the MDI work around. So a taskbar button for every 
</I>&gt;<i> window is highly undesirable.
</I>
You can force a window to not have a taskbar button by setting
window.SkipTaskbarHint = true.
