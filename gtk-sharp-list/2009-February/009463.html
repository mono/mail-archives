<PRE>Hi All,
 
I installed GTK# SDK (2.8.3) and GTK # runtime(2.8.3) to work in .net
framework in Windows XP.
It was working fine.
After the release of 2.12 version of GTK #, I uninstalled GTK # runtime
(2.8.3) and installed 2.12.7 version . 
This was also working fine.
But the problem raised when I uninstalled 2.12.7 runtime and installed 2.8.3
version.
While running the program getting exception like
&quot;Unable to find an entry point named 'glibsharp_closure_new' in DLL
'glibsharpglue-2'.&quot;
 
This is happening now in both the version of runtime.
Please suggest something to overcome the error.
 
Thanks In Advance,
 
-Libin
