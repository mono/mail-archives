<PRE>Hello,

I am wondering if someone can give me some pointers to my problem? 

I am using MonoDevelop to develop some GUI applications in Mint-17.3 using
Mono. I want to use the TreeView as a DataGrid, which I know how to do it in
a test harness and using methods/code to configure the TreeView as a grid,
etc.

In OO, these methods should really be belonging to a data grid class that is
and I want to create MyDataGrid derived from TreeView. Using derivation also
allows me to access protected members.

I have investigated using Custom Widget but that does not generate a derive
class of any widget. It simply bundles the widgets you want to use as a
whole unit in a package. 

The questions I want to ask for help are:
1) How do I use this derived class with the MonoDevelop UI designer? For
example, inserting MyDataGrid into say a HBox
2) How do I refer MyDataGrid in MonoDevelop, without being a Custom Widget
in the designer?

After studying the generated code Build(), I managed to follow some of the
logic to get my test harness 'working' to use MyDataGrid. My technique
essentially ditches the UI drag-drop way to build up the UI for the part
where I want to use my derived class.

Not sure if that is the right way or is there a better way if anyone can
suggest?

Thanks.

MarL
