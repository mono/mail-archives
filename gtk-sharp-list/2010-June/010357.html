Ok.  You don't technically need to do this though.  And note that
Application.Invoke is asynchronous (it returns immediately, probably
before the delegate runs).  And as I mentioned before, the delegate will
not run until control of the main thread returns to the GLib main loop.
 So by doing it this way, you are actually going to delay showing of the
dialog by a very small fraction of a second.

However, most operations you are going to perform (such as setting a
progress bar's value) can be done whether the dialog is shown or not.
The changes will be visible once the dialog is shown.

The only thing you really have to worry about is if the Show() call
happens after the Destroy() call.  But again, as you should be using
Application.Invoke() to call Destroy(), the dialog cannot be destroyed
until it is shown, since it is shown before control returns to the GLib
main loop.

Make sense?

In programming, everything is easy when you know what to do.  ;)

&gt;<i> Just thinking -- would you like/mind to add this to the web page you

</I>&gt;<i> piece.

I thought it already had an example of this... or maybe it was removed.
 I'm not sure.  But I do recall reading such an example on the Mono
website a while ago.
