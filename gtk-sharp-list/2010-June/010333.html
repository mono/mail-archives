Unless you can manage to get complete control of the windowing system,
whether that be X or the Windows GUI subsystem, this is an impossible
task.  Screenshot programs typically just attempt to grab the contents
of the display framebuffer, which is outside the control of your program.

The only conceivable way to accomplish this would be to monitor the
running processes for applications that can take screenshots and blank
out your window if any are running.  And this is, of course, a terrible
hack, and would be incredibly easy to get around.
