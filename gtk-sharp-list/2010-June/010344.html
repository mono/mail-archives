That's because &quot;completely obscured by other windows&quot; is not a state,
it's just the net effect of the positions of all of the open windows.
If you want to know if your window is completely obscured then you will
have to obtain all of the rectangles defining all of the desktop's
windows' positions and sizes and compute the obscured regions of your
window yourself.
