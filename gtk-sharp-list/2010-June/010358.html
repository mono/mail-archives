And, actually, I should have also noted that the dialog will be shown at
the point that the delegates run, which I explained after this
paragraph.  Basically, in your click event handler (or whatever) you
will probably be doing something like this:

----------8&lt;----------
var dialog = new ProgressDialog();

new Thread(delegate() {
   // This is where you would do your actual work.
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) {
      Application.Invoke(delegate { dialog.Progress = i / 1000d; });
      Thread.Sleep(100);
   }

   Application.Invoke(delegate { dialog.Destroy(); });
}).Start();

// It is *impossible* for any of the invoked delegates to be run
// here, because this method is running on the GLib main loop thread.

dialog.Show();
----------8&lt;----------

Note that if you are really concerned (which you shouldn't be) then you
can also do this instead:

----------8&lt;----------
var dialog = new ProgressDialog();
var thread = new Thread(delegate() { ... });

dialog.Show();
thread.Start();
----------8&lt;----------
