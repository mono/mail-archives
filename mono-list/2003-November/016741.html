<PRE>Hello people!

I just read the hacking roadmao, and I really want to help!
Not on time critical things, since I don't always have it :-)

What I can:
- C#, fairly good (no miguel just please don't look at that very small game 
i made for testing SDL.NET on mono - thats not my way of coding if it 
doesn't have to be done fast)
- limited to no really usable C skills (the language yes, but the unix libs 
no)

What I have to code:
- At the place i have the most time to write code, I have at my 
availability: SharpDevelop, the .NET framework 1.1, and ofcourse mono. 
Sorry, no C/C++ compiler (could be arranged)
- Eventually in the evening a Gentoo Linux box at home, which has everything 
i would need.

What I would like to do:
- Something visible with results. I just really don't like things like a 
backbackbackend of a library or something, but something that could be a bit 
'visible' (think about the new .NET 1.2 features)
- C# if it could be arranged :P

Please let me know if there is anything for me...
