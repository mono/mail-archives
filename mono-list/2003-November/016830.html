<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> I want to write a C# editor tool as Visual Studio or SharpDevelop, but specialized
</I>&gt;<i> on Mono and GTk# enviroment. I would need a C# parser and some .cs files
</I>&gt;<i> of the mcs sources (/mcs directory) that are exactly that I'm looking for
</I>&gt;<i> (using it, I could implement code analysis or autocompletion). I don't know
</I>&gt;<i> if I could include some files of the sources on my own project (making clear
</I>&gt;<i> where I find it), if I have to notify to the user to download the mcs sources
</I>&gt;<i> to compile my project or if I cannot use it anyway r:-/ Do I have to change
</I>&gt;<i> my project to GPL license?
</I>
The C# compiler code is covered under the GPL, so if you use that code,
your code would have to be compatible with the GPL.

I understand that SharpDevelop also has a C# parser that does
intellisense and auto-completion.  The engine is separated from the
actual widget, so you could save a lot of time and just use that (MCS
source code is not designed to be used in that way).

Notice that SharpDevelop's code is also GPL.

Miguel
