<PRE>hello,

&gt;<i> What I would like to do:
</I>&gt;<i> - Something visible with results. I just really don't like things like a 
</I>&gt;<i> backbackbackend of a library or something, but something that could be a bit 
</I>&gt;<i> 'visible' (think about the new .NET 1.2 features)
</I>&gt;<i> - C# if it could be arranged :P
</I>
There are many areas that need work:

	* ASP.NET v2 controls: there are about 40 new controls, and 700 new
	  classes in ASP.NET v2, so am sure you will find something interesting
	  there.

	* Windows.Forms: we have a small, but motivated team of Windows.Forms
	  developers, but they need your help: tons of controls, tons of bugs.

	* System.Drawing: highly visible, we have set a direction with it:
	  we are going to use GdiPlus to implement it, so on Unix we have to
	  build our own emulation layer in C.

	  Implement all the missing functionality (which is a lot, but is relatively
	  simple to do).

And of course, the most visible bug is Mono not being 1.0, so helping
out closing every bug on Bugzilla is probably going to bring us Mono to
everyone faster.

See:

	www.go-mono.com/bugs.html

For quick-links to bugs.

Also, Bugzilla is useful to build character, since you get to learn how
Mono fits together, the build process, submitting a patch, etc.

Miguel
