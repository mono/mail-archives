<PRE>Rhys,
     SearchResultCollection and SearchResult classes are still not
completed and they are in progress ,thats why I haven't included them in
the System.DirectoryServices.dll build. That is the reason these files
are not appearing in System.DirectoryServices.dll . I will be completing
them soon.

Regards,
Sunil

</I>Hi Sunil,

I've been trying to get Mono's System.DirectoryServices to compile with

Portable.NET, and I've found a couple of problems.

First, the constructor for &quot;SearchResultCollection&quot; is declared as
&quot;internal 
PropertyCollection()&quot; (i.e. it has the wrong name).  The &quot;SearchResult&quot;
class 
refers to a type called &quot;Properties&quot; (line 45) that does not appear to
exist 
anywhere that I could find.

When I exclude these two classes from the build, it compiles fine.  I
note 
that the &quot;System.DirectoryServices.dll.sources&quot; file does not appear to

contain those two classes.

Was it a deliberate choice that those two classes were omitted from the
build, 
or merely an oversight?

Cheers,

Rhys.
