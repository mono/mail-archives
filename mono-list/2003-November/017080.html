LLVM should map to *unverifiable* CIL without too much difficulty, I think.
Well, actually you'd map to a subset of that: you wouldn't use the
object model instructions at all.

It's mostly fairly straight-forward to map general C programs onto
unverifiable CIL.  Casting a pointer to int or vice versa is easy, just
push as one type and pop as another.  Pointer arithmetic is just integer
addition.  The C heap is unmanaged memory which can be allocated either
as a global array or using OS-specific code.  There are some tricky parts,
such as volatile and setjmp/longjmp, but these are not insurmountable
hurdles -- they can be handled, it just requires a little more cleverness.

&gt;<i> The best way to do this would be to make a _new_ C/C++ compiler like
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft did, which adds language restrictions for managed mode.
</I>
Microsoft's C++ compiler, and lcc, and the C compiler in Portable.NET
can all compile almost every C construct to unverifiable IL.  I don't
know if any of them handle volatile properly, and AFAIK none of them
handle setjmp/longjmp.  But that's just lack of development resources.
