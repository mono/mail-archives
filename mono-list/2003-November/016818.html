Rotor is a Microsoft product, released under their Shared-Source license
(which basically allows you to do nothing with the code aside from look
at it). It is a crippled version of the CLR and the C# compiler that
runs on Windows XP, FreeBSD and now Mac OS X, I believe (or at least an
OS X version was supposed to be forthcoming). 

I was told very early in the Mono project's lifetime that if I was ever
to contribute to Mono, I had best not have looked at the Rotor source
code, lest some nasty inter-license issues come up. Its next to
worthless to check that code out anyway, AFAIK, as it does not support
very many class libraries and the compiler is well below workable
efficiency. You can, however, find information and downloads for Rotor
at the following URL:
