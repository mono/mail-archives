<PRE>Hi

&gt;<i> Hello everybody.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I love mono. Open-source dotnet. But for my line of work it is unusable
</I>&gt;<i> and will remain so for a long time. You see certain parts seems to be
</I>&gt;<i> ignored in mono and it is of great concern to me (and I hope others).
</I>
No parts of .NET are ignored, it is just that nobody has started
contributing those parts, and the core Mono team has other priorities.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Code Access Security
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Little has been done in this area. And I believe in the great security
</I>&gt;<i> motto : You can't hack in security afterwards, it will lead to a mess.
</I>&gt;<i> CAS spans most of the class libraries.
</I>
See &quot;Unscheduled activities&quot; section on the mono roadmap for info about
this.

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Messaging
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> .NET is to compete with J2EE. .NET has messaging based on MSMQ. We have
</I>&gt;<i> no implementation of this, and no credible alternative. Without it we
</I>&gt;<i> can't be taken seriously in the enterprise domain.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) EnterpriseServices
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We have no transaction support. I do believe that COM+ will be a little
</I>&gt;<i> bit difficult to duplicate. The closest we can get to this is using
</I>&gt;<i> CORBA... And open-source CORBA itself has neglected Transactions. It
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't seem if either mySQL or postgreSQL supports the XA Transaction
</I>&gt;<i> standards. Yet again, for any serious EE application this is mandatory.
</I>
All we want Mono to be a credible platform for building enterprise
applications, and I'm sure that Mono's support in this area will grow
once the runtime, core and basic libraries become more complete and
stable.

The landscape has changed quite a lote since the last PDC. The priority
will be to build Indigo, because it replaces Messaging and
EnterpriseServices. 

However, if there is people really interested in EnterpriseServices and
Messaging, I think that the right path is to build them on top of
Indigo, since it provides most of the needed infrastructure (it provides
a transaction manager, reliable messaging and so on).

Lluis.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now most of the people will most likely say, shut up and pitch in but
</I>&gt;<i> these components span multiple parts of the .NET implementation as well
</I>&gt;<i> as other open-source projects. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If anybody has any ideas on how we are going to solve this problem drop
</I>&gt;<i> me an e-mail please. If nothing else I do hope that people starts to
</I>&gt;<i> talk about these components.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers
</I>&gt;<i> Johan du Plessis
