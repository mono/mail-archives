I checked out the source from CVS today and tried to update my  Mono/Mcs
install as described by the README.  I got the error that was described
above and copied over the corlib.dll from monocharge which fixed that
error (thanks).  I then followed the directions down to &quot;make fullbuild&quot;
in mono which generated some errors.  I can't see how to fix these
errors via the directions above.  For starters, the errors would full
quite a few pages printed so while scanning them the biggest piece comes
from mono/metadata and it ends at mcs/class/System.Drawing (I see some
stuff about Cairo).  But honestly I'm not sure how to diagnose this.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
