<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; While possible, it would be _very_ difficult.  LLVM code is more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; expressive/low-level than CIL code: for example array bounds checks are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not implicit, and there is no object model.  I'm not sure exactly how you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would map general C programs onto the managed runtime at least, much less
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; general LLVM programs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> LLVM should map to *unverifiable* CIL without too much difficulty, I think.
</I>&gt;<i> Well, actually you'd map to a subset of that: you wouldn't use the
</I>&gt;<i> object model instructions at all.
</I>
Ah, ok.  I thought the unverifiable CIL was basically just machine code.
I didn't know it used the stack machine: cool!

&gt;<i> It's mostly fairly straight-forward to map general C programs onto
</I>&gt;<i> unverifiable CIL.  Casting a pointer to int or vice versa is easy, just
</I>&gt;<i> push as one type and pop as another.  Pointer arithmetic is just integer
</I>&gt;<i> addition.  The C heap is unmanaged memory which can be allocated either
</I>&gt;<i> as a global array or using OS-specific code.
</I>
Ok.  There are _inherently_ difficult parts though.  For example, you
can't really translate '#ifdef BIG_ENDIAN' style code into a portable
representation, no matter what it is.

&gt;<i> There are some tricky parts,
</I>&gt;<i> such as volatile and setjmp/longjmp, but these are not insurmountable
</I>&gt;<i> hurdles -- they can be handled, it just requires a little more cleverness.
</I>
The hardest part is probably handling all of the libc functions that
everyone expects: signals, stdio, etc.  Running a subset of C programs
probably wouldn't be that hard.  Also, it's not volatile itself that is
the problem: it's the reasons that volatile exists which you probably
wouldn't be able to support (mmap'd IO, etc).

Also, you might be interested to know that LLVM already maps
setjmp/longjmp into exception handling constructs, so I expect sjlj to not
be a big problem in a CIL mapping...

&gt;<i> &gt; The best way to do this would be to make a _new_ C/C++ compiler like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Microsoft did, which adds language restrictions for managed mode.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft's C++ compiler, and lcc, and the C compiler in Portable.NET
</I>&gt;<i> can all compile almost every C construct to unverifiable IL.  I don't
</I>&gt;<i> know if any of them handle volatile properly, and AFAIK none of them
</I>&gt;<i> handle setjmp/longjmp.  But that's just lack of development resources.
</I>
LLVM preserves volatile correctly and maps SJLJ into exceptions.  It also
supports the full set of GCC extensions, and uses the G++ &quot;3.4&quot; parser.
If anyone would like to try out LLVM, please download it (or you can use
the webpage: <A HREF="http://llvm.cs.uiuc.edu/demo">http://llvm.cs.uiuc.edu/demo</A> ).  Of course, I would be happy
to answer any questions...
