You have to distinguish between _unverifiable_ code, and _unmanaged_ code.
The former uses the stack machine, the latter is just machine code.

&gt;<i> &gt; It's mostly fairly straight-forward to map general C programs onto
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unverifiable CIL.  Casting a pointer to int or vice versa is easy, just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; push as one type and pop as another.  Pointer arithmetic is just integer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; addition.  The C heap is unmanaged memory which can be allocated either
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as a global array or using OS-specific code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok.  There are _inherently_ difficult parts though.  For example, you
</I>&gt;<i> can't really translate '#ifdef BIG_ENDIAN' style code into a portable
</I>&gt;<i> representation, no matter what it is.
</I>
That's true.  But code which uses #ifdef BIG_ENDIAN is not
standard-conforming C code.

&gt;<i> The hardest part is probably handling all of the libc functions that
</I>&gt;<i> everyone expects: signals, stdio, etc.
</I>
Right.  For most of that, you can implement it using PInvoke to invoke
the underlying (run-time) platform's libc.  However, because there are
a lot of macros that the C standard specifies are (compile-time) constant
expressions, you would have to wrap a lot of the functionality.
That is, you'd need to define your own set of C header files that define
the constants in a platform-independent way, and then have the implementation
of the C functions work by PInvoking your own C wrapper functions which
convert these constants to the appropriate platform-specific values and
then invoke the wrapped libc function.
