<PRE>This is slightly off-from the C++/CLI specifically, but some type of compiler 
that is aware of GCC-produced C++ code and can produce managed code would be 
wonderful.

As someone working on calling C++ code from C#, I really would like a Free 
compiler like Managed Extensions to C++. It would eliminate so many problems 
if GCC could produce CLI assemblies and yet allow the user to call unmanaged 
code without having to use P/Invoke.

Unfortunately, it appears that there's a huge overhead in learning GCC's 
structure, and this would entail not only a new front end but also a back end 
that can emit managed and unmanaged (e.g. x86 code), so it would somehow have 
to invoke an existing back-end.
