<PRE>Hi,

I've been trying to use linecap to make lines with arrows at the end,
and while this works fine in .NET, I can't seem to get it to work on
mono. I know this is dependent on libcairo and libgdiplus, but has
anyone successfully used pen caps in mono? 

If yes, I could try recompiling libcairo, libgdiplus and mono from svn
and try again, but I'm starting to think this isn't implemented at all.

I've been successful in other settings, such as pen color, seems like
pen caps is the only thing I haven't been able to do with lines.

Thank you,
