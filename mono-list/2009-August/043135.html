<PRE>Hi All,

I need some help getting a SVN compile on Mac OS X going.  My latest
project will be a very simple ASP.NET MVC site.  It's perfect to try a
soup to nuts development lifecycle using strictly Mono and
MonoDevelop.

Here's what I have so far:
1.  Mac OS X with Mono 2.4.2.1 official binary installation installed
in /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/2.4.2.1
2.  Macports with a bunch of libraries placed in /opt/local
3.  Fresh SVN sources of the mono, mcs, and libgdiplus modules.

What I'd like to do:
Get a successful build of Mono, XSP, and MonoDevelop from SVN while
maintaining the official Mono binary release in parallel.  I'm
attempting to put the source build into
/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/svn.  I should be able to
easily switch between the two at will - I see there's a soft link at
/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current which points to
/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/2.4.2.1.  I'd like to
simply update the link to point at the
/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/svn directory when I want
to switch.  However, there are also a bunch of binaries in
/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Commands which are not links and
therefore I assume are a little more difficult to switch at will.

The optimal solution would be to use the libraries installed by
macports in /opt/local (things like gettext and libtool).  So far I
have been unsuccessful.  So I tried compiling each dependency by hand
a la <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Compiling_Mono_on_OSX">http://www.mono-project.com/Compiling_Mono_on_OSX</A> but still no
joy.  I'm currently stuck while trying to configure glib:

configure: error:
*** You must have either have gettext support in your C library, or use the
*** GNU gettext library. (<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext.html</A>

This happens regardless of whether I set CPPFLAGS to include the
macports headers for gettext or my personally compiled version of
gettext which I placed in
/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/svn.  But, as stated
above, I'd much prefer using macports version of these libs.

Would someone please give me some general guidance to get this going?
And not to add any bribes or anything, but I intend to blog a howto on
both getting the environment setup as above but also the overall
development experience with MonoDevelop + ASP.NET MVC + Mac OS X.

Thanks.
-Abe
