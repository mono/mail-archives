<PRE>Some progress, at last! Review: trying to use Mono to port ancient VB.net code to run on iOS...

Using a simple project with a single public class, &quot;DtaProject&quot; and two public methods, &quot;Load&quot; and &quot;Save&quot;, I was able to build a dll using System.Core and WindowsBase. I then emailed that to my Mac with Xamarin, Referenced it, and presto. No minor miracle, this!

Unfortunately while I can refer to the object in my .cs code on Xamarin, none of the methods appear. 



Before going further, does this ring any bells for anyone?



That dll is not a PCL dll, so I went back to the PC and build a new PCL/.net 4.0 project that imported...

System
System.Core
System.Data
System.Xml
WindowsBase

However, this will not compile, with a number of what appear to be odd errors. For instance, it complains that FileStream does not exist, although according to github it does (in corlib, did I get the wrong dll?). XmlNodeType likewise fails, although it seems that is indeed part of System.Xml. Finally, it says Uri is ambiguous within System, which really confuses me, because it seems I'm importing two Uri's or something?

I suspect I'm simply importing the wrong dll - am I supposed to use the one's in the /x.0/ directories, or the ones in the gac? Or are these the same? Or am I supposed to be importing the Microsoft versions of these libraries, and let the infrastructure handle selecting the right one on different platforms?

I suspect I'm moments away from a working DLL, but I'm still confused by too little understanding of the .net architecture to know what I'm doing wrong.
