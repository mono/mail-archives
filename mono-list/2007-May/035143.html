Hi, 
I am using Mono.Security.dll to bind to eDirectory using SSL and
Novell.Directory.Ldap 
 
I have been able to get mono installed locally and authenicate against
eDirectory without any problems. However I am having problems getting mono
to work on a test server and I am assuming it is a security issue and
wondering if anyone has any ideas? 
 
The error in question is SSL provider not found and I know this is because
Novell.Directory.Ldap either can't see or access the mono.security.dll. The
dll is in the system32 folder and assembly bin folder with the project in
question referencing the Novell.Directory.Ldap dll but still not joy, but
runs fine locally. I can replicate the error localy by simply removing the
mono.security.dll from the system32 folder. So I am a little confused as the
setup on the server is the same as locally and thinking it must be some sort
of extra security issue on the server.  
 
So does anyone have any pointers of things I could look into? Does it matter
that the server is partitioned and the iis directories are on a different
partition to where Mono is installed?  
 
Are there any permissions issues I might need to look into regarding the
system32 folder? Any help would be great 
 
Thanks in advance
