Yes, you are completely right when saying that a workaround can be  
easily done using the already implemented tools... It shouldn't be a  
hard think to do a conditional compilation of the code where  
according to the platform the code would use one technology or other  
one...

The problem is that for some reason the people a Microsoft decided to  
use a completely new namespace for SqlCe server. That is, they have  
implemented a SqlCeDataReader, SqlCeCommand etc...

My question is the following.. If someone has already created an  
application using the Visual studio tools and have made some code  
such as

public void Method(){

	SqlCeConnection conn = new SqlCeConnection(connectionString);
	SdlCeCommand sql = new SqlCeCommand(&quot;SELECT * FROM table&quot;, conn);
	
	SqlCeDataReader dataReader = sql.ExecuteReader();

	while(dataReader.Read())
	{
		//blah blah blah
	}

}

Should we allow them to compile the code with out changing the code,  
or on the other hand should you force them to use the more correct code:

public void Method(){

	IDbConnection conn = new SqlCeConnection(connectionString);
	IDbCommand sql = new SqlCeCommand(&quot;SELECT * FROM table&quot;, conn);
	
	IDataReader dataReader = sql.ExecuteReader();

	while(dataReader.Read())
	{
		//blah blah blah
	}

}

We all agree that the second code is a more correct one since it  
allows to easily change of db technology, but we can also agree that  
there are the hell of a lot of programmers that do not use the  
interfaces and use the objects instead. What I'm proposing is to  
create the name space to avoid making people change their code when  
compiling on linux, at the end of the day that would make the switch  
easier for programmers, wouldn't it??

PD: I forgot to say that SqlCE runs on the compact framework as well  
as on the full version, why??? I don't know, I suppose they want to  
give it as an alternative for access db.
