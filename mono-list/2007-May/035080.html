<PRE>Hi everyone,

First off, thank you to everyone on the Mono team!  You are doing an 
excellent job and I don't doubt there are many people like me out there 
who have trouble free experiences and fail to give you any feedback 
until the day something doesn't go right.

I am working on a fairly large web application which has I have intended 
to run on Mono from day 1.  Being a windows developer I worked on the 
project on my XP workstation (sharpdevelop, running the site in Personal 
web server from Visual Studio 2005) and porting the software over to 
debian/mono for testing. 

I have finally made the move to full time development on a debian 
workstation using Monodevelop and overall the transition was very smooth 
(congrats to the Monodevelop team also, its excellent!).  (Side note: 
when i rebuild a web app from md while xsp2 is running my entire system 
crashes and I have to hit the reset button? Hd churns and it is possibly 
automatic assembly reloading in xsp2 similar to what happens under .net? 
Happen for anyone else?)

We have run into issues with stability, where the web application (under 
xsp2), and the fixtures application (console app) both freeze randomly.  
I have not been able to pinpoint any particular point in the code where 
it fails.  If I add tracing the program runs slower and freezes far less 
often.  The faster the program is running the more likely it is to 
freeze.  The application includes log4net, mysql provider, and 
httpwebrequest amongst other things.  We have had some issues with 
httpwebrequest, notably for certain requests it fails every 3rd time.  I 
am starting to believe that it may be the root of all of the freezes.  
When the application freezes i have to ctrl-z, kill -9 to kill the process.

I've toyed with --trace extensively and not been able to specifically 
catch HttpWebRequest 'in the act' so I could be on the completely wrong 
path?

I'm just looking for anyone having similar issues that can help guide me 
toward making some unit tests to demonstrate the problem so that I can 
resolve it or submit a bug.

My system is a 6400 core2 running on the latest stable debian 
(i386/32bit), with mono 1.2.3.1 which I downloaded using apt-get from 
the unstable debian repository.


Cheers for any advice,
Mike Cleaver
