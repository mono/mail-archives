<PRE>Hi everyone, about a week ago I posted about a problem I was having 
running my app under Mono.  My app (hosted in xsp2 or test environments) 
completely froze at random intervals requiring the process to be 
killed.  Taking some advice, I experimented with --debug &amp; kill -QUIT 
without much luck (I didnt get any stack trace on most threads).  I also 
didn't really get anywhere using tracing as the resulting decrease in 
performance prevented my app from crashing - I'd assume it is 
threading/deadlock related?

Anyway we have worked around the issue now and the application runs 
perfectly.  What I did was include the MySql 5.0.7 provider in the MD 
solution and let MD setup project references to include it in the 
various projects in the solution.  I'm pretty sure that I had compiled 
the MySql provider from source previously using nant, but prehaps I 
didn't compile it in debug or maybe I compiled it under windows.  
Anyway, now that it is being compiled as part of my solution it runs 
fine.  I havnt tried running the app in release mode yet though...

So my question is: can compiling libraries in .Net 2.0 or Mono2/Windows 
generate different/incompatible libraries? Or am I just on the wrong track?

Thanks for all the replies to my previous thread,
Mike
