<PRE>Looking for a client to access CodePlex from a Mono/Linux box?

I'd like to announce version 0.4.4 of Team Foundation for Mono,
a major update which includes diff support, gnome-keyring support,
and several new commands from the TF Power Tool.

Team Foundation powers Microsoft's CodePlex site and is used in many
corporate environments - its tightly integrated with Visual Studio.

Team Foundation for Mono provides the TF client for accessing
Team Foundation Servers as well as the Microsoft.TeamFoundation.*
assemblies related to Version Control.

An example of accessing CodePlex to pull the latest version of
the &quot;Turtle&quot; project is at the bottom of this email.

Special thanks to Matthias Hertel for his BSD licensed C# implementation 
of &quot;An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and its Variations&quot; by Eugene Myers.


Major Feature Additions include:
===================================================================
# add diff command with support for diff against server latest,
   diff of pending changes, diff view of any changeset.

# add basic version of TF Power Tool 1.1 &quot;online&quot; command to tf.exe,
   includes /preview mode.

# add basic version of TF Power Tool 1.2 &quot;treeclean&quot; command to tf.exe,
   includes /preview mode.

# add support for response file processing and multiple commands
   on a single command line, please see documentation for usage	

# add changeset and help commands

# add configure command with options &quot;Checkin.Validate&quot;,
   &quot;Credentials.Save&quot;, and &quot;History.Recursive&quot;. See man page for more
   details.

# if &quot;Credentials.Save&quot; is set to true, the tf client can load/store
   credentials from the gnome-keyring or TfClient.config.


Minor Enhancements include:
===================================================================
# read server setings from cache file, don't need /server
   quite as much now

# add /format:detailed option to history command
	
# undoing a delete restores the file now

# numerous API additions including: WorkspaceVersionSpec, IDiffItem,
   DiffItemVersionedFile, DiffOutputType, DiffOptionFlags, DiffOptions,
   Conflict*, ExceptionEvent* types

# add DisplayString property for all VersionSpec classes

# prompts for password if not provided on the command line

# better man page and error messages

# more test cases


Bugfixes include:
===================================================================
Many bugfixes from running TF client against Microsoft's TFS assemblies

# BUGFIX: when a file is checked in mark it should be marked read-only

# BUGFIX: do case insensitive string comparisons in ls-files and
   online commands on windows, and use Path.DirectorySeparatorChar

# BUGFIX: GetLocalWorkspaceInfo should find longest matching path,
   not first matching path

# BUGFIX: tf get should use CWD only to find workspace

# BUGFIX: properly handle checkin of files marked read-only

# BUGFIX: on windows find correct TFS VersionControl.config file


Miscellaneous:
===================================================================
NOTE: in this release VersionControl.config is now stored in 
~/.tf/Cache/, instead of ~/.tf/ - this change was made for consistency 
with the  MS versions of the TFS assemblies. If you've used the TF tool 
previously, just move VersionControl.config from ~/.tf/ to ~/.tf/Cache/

Please note that this software is alpha. Use it at your own risk!


Source and Packages
===================================================================
Debian packages and source tarball available here:
    <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/tf4mono/downloads/list">http://code.google.com/p/tf4mono/downloads/list</A>

Additionally, a git clone of the source tree can be made with:

     git clone <A HREF="git://repo.or.cz/tfs.git">git://repo.or.cz/tfs.git</A>

will include a signed v0.4.4 tag which points to a commit named:

     d583cdc72b6e283869576ea970f28bc9a331ce9b

which can be verified with:

     gpg --keyserver <A HREF="hkp://keyserver.veridis.com">hkp://keyserver.veridis.com</A> --recv-keys 0xB1850655

     git verify-tag v0.4.4

and can be checked out with a command such as:

     git checkout -b build v0.4.4


Project Site
===================================================================
There is a Google Code Project Site for tf4mono, the URL is:
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/tf4mono/">http://code.google.com/p/tf4mono/</A>


CodePlex Example Usage
===================================================================
In the commands below,
    UID = your codeplex user name
    PWD = your codeplex password
    MACHINENAME = your machine name (or any other random name)

First create a workspace:

tf /server:<A HREF="https://tfs01.codeplex.com">https://tfs01.codeplex.com</A> /login:snd\\UID,PWD
workspace /new &quot;MACHINENAME;UID&quot;

Then map &quot;Turtle&quot; project to a local folder:

tf /server:<A HREF="https://tfs01.codeplex.com">https://tfs01.codeplex.com</A> /login:snd\\UID,PWD
workfold &quot;$/Turtle&quot; ~/Source/turtle

Then pull the files:

tf /server:<A HREF="https://tfs01.codeplex.com">https://tfs01.codeplex.com</A> /login:snd\\UID,PWD get
~/Source/turtle /recursive

Then you could review the history, review a changeset, then look
at the diff of the changeset. Note: the examples below assume
Credentials.Save is on.

cd ~/Source/turtle
tf history /recursive .
tf changeset 340
tf diff C340

That's it. Enjoy,

jr
