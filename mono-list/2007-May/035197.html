<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i>   This is my first mail to this list, and I am a new Mono Developer. I
</I>&gt;<i> hope
</I>&gt;<i> to use this list to learn more about mono and C# on linux platforms.
</I>&gt;<i>   I would like to know how it is possible to change the priority of a
</I>&gt;<i> process running on Unix based platform, say SuSe Linux, using C# compiled
</I>&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;<i> Mono.
</I>&gt;<i>  I have tried using this following Code snippet,
</I>

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>            Process Simple = new Process();
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>           Simple.StartInfo.FileName   = &quot;mono&quot;;
</I>&gt;<i>           Simple.StartInfo.Arguments = &quot;/home/ksrijith/Simple.exe&quot;;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>           Simple.Start();
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>           Console.WriteLine(&quot;Simple Running with priority {0}&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> Simple.PriorityClass);
</I>&gt;<i>           Simple.PriorityClass = ProcessPriorityClass.BelowNormal ;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    But the priority of the process does not change and is always &quot;Normal&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Is there any kind of privileges i need to set for this to work on Unix. or
</I>&gt;<i> is there any way i can do this using Mono.Unix namespace. ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Please excuse me, if this has already been discussed in the list. I am
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> newbie and didn`t know how to search the existing archives..!
</I>
What you have to keep in mind is that Mono relies on your operating system
API at the end : in the Linux world (as well as the other Unices/like
ones), processes are created using exec?() and the so famous fork() 
system calls and it is not possible to tell them a new priority for the
newly created process (&quot;child processes are created like their father&quot;).

But.. you can alter a process priority later and this operation is known
as &quot;renicing&quot; : you can use either the renice command from the shell (see
renice(1)) or use the setpriority() system call in your code (this implies
a P/Invoke in your C# code). AFAK, &quot;renicing&quot; just gives the process
scheduler a /hint/ about how it has to schedule your process /relatively/
to the others and you are left at its mercy. Windows and Unices/likes
handles that in a very different way, I do not have a precise knowledge
about Windows and Unix scheduler internals so will I leave the explanation
to someone else ;-)

Under normal conditions, there are no reasons to alter a process nice
value (may your application has to do heavy computations that could
seriously slow down the system ?). If your program has to be run only on
Linux/Unix, the best option for you is to launch it from a shell-script
next put in the shell-script a renice call. Two reasons for that :

1. You follow the Unix &quot;philosphy&quot;
2. It will make you life easier (lowering a process nice value can be done
under your standard user account but increasing it requires super-user
privileges, so you could do &quot;sudo&quot; later).

Hope that will help...

Adrien.
