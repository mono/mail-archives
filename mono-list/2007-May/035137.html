<PRE>Hello Stojance,
Thank you for your reply. I hope you don't mind that I am posting back
to the mono list. I am hoping someone may read this and give some hints.

Already passing --enable-nermerle.

Well, here's the problem. Monodevelop expects nemerle &gt;= 0.9.3.99.
Latest stable is 0.9.3, so it is not enough. Surprisingly, SVN trunk
identifies as 0.9.3 as well. So although it may be enough, it isn't.
Only the snapshots are 0.9.3.99.NNNN where NNNN is some kind of index
always incrementing by one. The next step is obvious, go grab the latest
snapshot and play with it. I did that several times always getting one
of these problems:
- Nemerle didn't compile. Probably instability that can be expected of
snapshots.
- Monodevelop didn't compile *if* --enable-nemerle was passed. Possibly
incompatibilities between Monodevelop and the latest Nemerle at that
time.
I bet there are some snapshots that work and some that doesn't. If
anybody knows a bit more about this, I'll be grateful if that
information is shared.

Thank you.
