<PRE>Hi guys,

I have been recently working on a Windows CE/XP application... one of
the ideas we had when developing the application was to use a SqlCE
database file (.sdf) to store the different data used by the
application. I though it would be nice to try an compile it with mono
(gmcs) and get it running on Linux, but I've got the problem that the
namespace System.Data.SqlCeServer has no yet been implemented (let me
know it it has been).

I have been thinking to implement the different classes of this space
myself, is there anyone already doing this??? 

I have already done most of the NUnit tests that the classes should pass
and I'm testing them with the Microsoft dll. I'm thinking of either
creating the dll as a wrapper of the SQLite namespace (both databases
are file based) or simply finding a way to read the .sdf files. 

Although the first option is far easier to implement it will mean that
people will have different files according to the platform (Window =
sdf, Linux = sqlite), I don't think this is a massive issue, specially
because Linux users could have bigger dbs (.sdf has a max size of 4Gb)
and I could always make a tool to go from one to another....

Summarising, let me know what you think, and if there is anyone already
doing the SqlCeServer namespace, please tell me and I'll do my best to
help :)

</PRE>
