<PRE>Hi,

Sorry for the very strange and vague issue report:

My c sharp mono program randomly works and doesn't work. When I say  
doesn't work - it doesn't crash - the program logic  inexplicably  
fails - I know, I know, bear with me...

My program has no IO apart from reading from files that I am positive  
are not changing between runs. There is no network code. There is no  
threading at all. There is no external process launching. There are  
no libraries apart from System.*.

When it suddenly stops working, if I put in a Console.WriteLine  
statement to see what's going on at a certain point it will suddenly  
work. And that's &quot;Console.WriteLine(&quot;test&quot;)&quot; - I'm not calling a  
property or anything that could possibly have a side effect in  
evaluating it.

I've tried running my program on two separate installations of Mono  
on a PowerPC OS X and an x86 Linux, one of those not being set up by  
myself. I've tried 1.2.3.1 and 1.2.4 with the same problem. It's very  
intermittent. I'll be working happily

The only strange thing I do is a massive amount of dynamic code  
emission. Lots of TypeBuilder and DynamicMethods. It also uses a fair  
bit of memory, usually up to about 500 MB. I am positive that there  
must be some subtle bug somewhere in Mono.

I know this is no information to diagnose any problem, but has anyone  
else had any kind of similar experience? Could anyone suggest  
anything I could try? Remember, there is no crash - the output of my  
program simply becomes wrong as if it branched incorrectly at some  
point, or some bit of memory changed behind my back.

Thanks

Chris Seaton
