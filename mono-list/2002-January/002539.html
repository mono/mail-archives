<PRE>Jim Hugunin, the original author of Jython (then JPython),
describes the basic architecture of Jython at

<A HREF="http://www.python.org/workshops/1997-10/proceedings/">http://www.python.org/workshops/1997-10/proceedings/</A>

From this and my own work on a python derivative that compiles to java
byte code, I don't see why many of the dynamic properties of python
can't be implemented. Of course, I'm not very familiar with CLI / CLR so
there are no doubt unexpected pitfalls.
