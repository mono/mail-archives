<PRE>&gt;<i> This isn't really specific to Mono at all.  If Ximian were able to

</I>&gt;<i> all copyright holders.  In the United States, licenses are contracts,
</I>&gt;<i> and the user is given the benefit of any ambiguity, since s/he did not

Doesn't the GPL specifically say that once you have released a copy of a
program under the GPL, you can't revoke the license on that particular piece
of software?

(i.e. you can distribute another copy of the program under a different
license as long as you are the copyright holder, but you can't revoke the
GPL on an already-distributed copy.)

Does anyone have a copy of The Modern Law of Copyright, where the quote in
the link a couple of messages back comes from?

Cheers,
Phil
