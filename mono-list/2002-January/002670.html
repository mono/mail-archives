Thanks, Miguel. Whilst I have had some, ahem, disagreements with the dotGNU
people in the past, this last attack goes beyond the pale. It also
demonstrates to me that you and Ximian have a far better understanding of
Free Software and the writings of Mr Stallman than does the dotGNU board.
Not surprising, really, since you know him personally. Personally, I think
they're just jealous and want your post on the FSF board...

And, they can complain all they like about the steering committe having been
&quot;annointed&quot; by RMS, it won't change the fact that dotGNU is falling further
behind Mono every day.

Martin
