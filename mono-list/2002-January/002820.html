<PRE>Hello Everyone,

   One mechanism that we have used at Ximian with Mono is that before we
make a CVS commit, we make a diff of the changes and post the patches to
an internal mailing list of ours.

   Posting the patches is used to do some peer-review of the code, and
at the same time allow for the code to hit CVS as soon as possible.  So
we do the peer-review in an out-of-band fashion.

   We tried for some time to use the public mailing list
(<A HREF="mailto:mono-list@ximian.com">mono-list@ximian.com</A>) to post the patches, but some people complained
that this was too much traffic and not necessarily something they were
interested in.

   I have created a new mailing list called
`<A HREF="mailto:mono-patches-list@ximian.com">mono-patches-list@ximian.com</A>'.  Now the question is whether we should
continue with manual patches being sent to the mailing list or whether
we should have a script that posts the patches as they get commited to
the CVS.

   The plus side is that we get and automated setup (so we get the
default behaviour by default), the downside is that you will get every
single two-line commit to the CVS posted to that mailing list.

   So I am not sure what is the best thing to do.

Miguel.
