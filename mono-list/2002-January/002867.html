:<i> Hi Gaurav,
</I>:<i>
</I>:<i> I took a look at the interfaces and have a few comments.
</I>
    Thanks for your time and the suggestions.

:<i>
</I>:<i> I think you're missing some interfaces for Content-Disposition.
</I>:<i> Inline/Attachment is only a part of what a Content-Disposition header
</I>:<i> can contain. Often times it also contains some parameters such as
</I>:<i> 'filename'. When implementing parameters, you'll want to read rfc2184
</I>:<i> and/or rfc2231 which describe how to encode/decode parameters.
</I>
    Yes, I have already gone through these RFCs. The thing what I wanted to put
in by the enumerations ContentDisposition and ContentType was the &quot;compulsory&quot;
parameter. The filename etc parameters are but optional. You may or may not
have. Also, they cannot be put as enum's. Though, as you suggest, I may as well
provide interfaces (or better classes) for ContentDisposition, though personally
I would not like that. A tool should generate the header and add it using Header
class.

:<i>
</I>:<i> The same pretty much goes for Content-Type. There needs to be a way to
</I>:<i> set parameters and get parameters.
</I>
    Yes! I can add these methods for the Header class!

:<i> I'm also not convinced that EncodedContent and DecodedData should return
</I>:<i> strings. Be aware that emails are not bound by any size limit and thus
</I>
    How can I miss this. It *MUST* be a stream, may be a simple StringStream
would suffice.

:<i>
</I>:<i> For class part, you will need a setContent. You may also want a
</I>:<i> Constructor that can take a raw mime stream to construct the Part from.
</I>
    But I already have the property &quot;Content&quot; that allows both get as well as
set. A constructor with raw mime-stream can be easily added.

:<i> I'm not sure where you are going with the PartList class. You should
</I>:<i> just be able to have a simple linked list within each Part. Btw, it may
</I>:<i> be beneficial to have a Multipart class that inherits from base class
</I>:<i> Part which contains a PartList. as well as interfaces for a Preamble as
</I>:<i> well as a Postamble.
</I>
    Oh, I just saw, I did not complete the PartList class. It's basically an
implementation of a collection of Part's, may be, linked list Part or a vector
(overheads here) or what ever. But I may very well remove this and modify Part
so as to allow space for linked-list_ing Part.

    Basically, what I wanted was to have was Body to contain PartList. You call
it MultiPart - well, that may be a better name, though I cannot see any other
difference between the two, or am I missing something?

:<i>
</I>:<i> At this point, you won't need a class Body. Class message can just
</I>:<i> contain a generic Part object (either a Multipart or a Part).
</I>
    Oh yes, I did not missing anything. Multipart = (Part)+ and so is Body. But
MultiPart, by name, looks closer to Part.

:<i> class Message should probably also inherit from class Part since a
</I>:<i> message doesn't differ much from a normal Mime Part. This also will more
</I>:<i> easily allow you to have multipart/rfc822 message parts as subparts of
</I>:<i> Multiparts.
</I>
    Thanks. That really really useful. Removing a lot of burden of lower-order
classes and putting a good hierarchy in place.

:<i>
</I>:<i> Not sure what class MimeEncoding is?
</I>
    Damn, it should have been Base64. There's nothing as &quot;MimeEncoding&quot;. Silly
me.

:<i>
</I>:<i> I'm guessing that class TextPlainEncoding and class
</I>:<i> QuotedPrintableEncoding are for encoding/decoding data? If this is the
</I>:<i> case, I assume that TextPlainEncoding will handle 7bit and 8bit? You
</I>
    I have space for them. I did not list all of the standard / popular encoding
schemes. TextPlainEncoding will take care of 7bit and 8bit and any other popular
variant.

:<i>
</I>:<i> If you haven't already started implementing anything, I suggest you look
</I>:<i> at the Camel interfaces (and maybe GMime as well?). I can tell you from
</I>
    Well, I haven't started as yes. I'm in designing_arch phase right now. I've
recently been trying to go through Camel, though have not looked at very closely
because of my tight schedule. GMime - that's new to me. Will have a look at it.

:<i> experience that you will need all of the interfaces that something like
</I>:<i> Camel provides for a really good mail library. You may even want to
</I>:<i> extend the Camel interfaces some.
</I>
    I will be more than willing to do so, but only if I find some time off the
&quot;new&quot; platform applications. That's quite interesting - starting from scratch
and building a-top, though building in c/c++ is even more exciting. I love
implementing c++ structues (class, hierarchy, polymorphism!!) through c
structures (structs, lists, enums).

    Thanks once again for your comments. It will definitely help in making the
API even more promising.


Cheers,
Gaurav Vaish
