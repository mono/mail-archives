Sure, if these languages are designed to target CIL and are (therefore)
pretty much just an alternative syntax for C#.

If you want your language to do anything that CIL doesn't directly
support, or you need to interoperate with CIL but your language doesn't
have all the features of CIL (or at least the CLS) then you are going to
have a much tougher time writing a compiler.

C# is going to be the easiest case, as it is practically the same
feature set as CIL.  The more different your language is from C#, the
more work you are going to have to do.

I would certainly think modifying gcc to be like the Managed C++
compiler would be way way more work than 1 semester.
