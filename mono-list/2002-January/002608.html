<PRE>All (Especially lawyer types),

I want to re-use code from OCL for Mono, which I think we determined was
OK.  However,  since the classes there are just shells, and sometimes
incomplete ones at that I am wondering how to handle the copyright
properly.

1) I want to give credit to OCL for what I used, and so we need to
include their license for those parts. How do we best do that?  Just put
their license file in the CVS tree?

2) Can I say at the top of the source, &quot;Some parts of this file are (C)
Intel&quot; blah blah blah, like that?  Or do we say that just once
somewhere?  Can I copyright the parts I add?  How do I do that when it's
all mixed up like a frog in a blender?

Thanks,
Nick D.
