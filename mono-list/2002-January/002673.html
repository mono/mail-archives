<PRE>Miguel,

  My only trouble with the copyright assignment was section 6(a). In the
world of bogus patent grants, and we do live in that world, I cannot
easily know if my work can subject Ximian to a suit. As an individual
copyright owner, I am not an attractive target for a large corporation
seeking to assert its patent rights. However, as part of the Mono
runtime, which I did want to contribute to but declined after reading
6(a), I am part of a much larger, more attractive target. If some third
party gains a bogus patent similar to work I do for Ximian, an event I
can easily imagine, then suddenly I have agreed to compensate Ximian
should it not prevail in the suit.

</I>&gt;<i> [mailto:<A HREF="mailto:mono-list-admin@ximian.com">mono-list-admin@ximian.com</A>] On Behalf Of Miguel de Icaza

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Re: [Mono-list] problems with relicensing
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But what if now Ximian changes the license to &quot;you can only use this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code if you pay Miguel de Icaza two-hundred gorgan-zillian 
</I>&gt;<i> dollars&quot;, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which would be in Ximian's rights to do.  Could Ximian make 
</I>&gt;<i> this license 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; change retroactive?  Let me be more specific: if Ximian has 
</I>&gt;<i> owned the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; copyright to my lexer since version 1.2, can they say that 
</I>&gt;<i> all software 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that uses a version of my lexer later than 1.2 (which may 
</I>&gt;<i> be /years/ old 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at this point) has to fork over money to Miguel or be sued?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is definitely not our intention.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will make sure that the copyright assignment will allow you 
</I>&gt;<i> to keep the right over your code as well (I do not have the 
</I>&gt;<i> copyright assignment form with me as I am in Mexico this week 
</I>&gt;<i> as well).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But basically, you should be able to do whatever you want 
</I>&gt;<i> with your code (even grant licenses to other people or 
</I>&gt;<i> relicense it yourself).  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The reason why the copyright assignment is required is not to 
</I>&gt;<i> sue people, but to be legally entitled to grant access to the 
</I>&gt;<i> source code under different licenses.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here is a scenario: a company decided that they wanted to 
</I>&gt;<i> build a set-top box using Mono, but that the GPL on the JIT 
</I>&gt;<i> engine would not allow them to deploy their system and still 
</I>&gt;<i> grant the recipient the rights they want (be able to modify 
</I>&gt;<i> the software you run on your settop box for example), we 
</I>&gt;<i> would be able legally to grant them a license to use the 
</I>&gt;<i> JITer on such set top box without infringing the GPL. n
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So then my problem becomes, do I donate my lexer to Ximian, 
</I>&gt;<i> knowing that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   /any other/ project I use it in may be put in jeopardy if Ximian
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; changes the lexer's license, as they have the right to do?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your contributions are available under the open source 
</I>&gt;<i> version of the libraries.  That means that even if we 
</I>&gt;<i> relicense the code, you can use the code as distributed 
</I>&gt;<i> originally (and use any of our code under the open source 
</I>&gt;<i> license terms for that particular piece).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If I didn't have some sort of legal guarantee that Ximian would not 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; retroactive changes to my code's license, the only code I 
</I>&gt;<i> would donate 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to Ximian would be code that I was sure I was never going to use 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anywhere else.  That doesn't sound like quality code to me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can not do retroactive changes.  You can not get back a 
</I>&gt;<i> gift you have given either ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Miguel.
