<PRE>Hello everyone,

   We have created a new mailing list: <A HREF="mailto:mono-patches@ximian.com">mono-patches@ximian.com</A>

   To subscribe, send email to: 

 	<A HREF="mailto:mono-patches-request@ximian.com">mono-patches-request@ximian.com</A>

   This mailing list will receive automatically the patches that are
submitted to the Mono CVS to any of its modules.    Active Mono
developers are encouraged to join.

   This allows anyone who wants to participate in the peer-review of the
code submitted to CVS to receive patches on e-mail.  It should also
expose to everyone the changes that are being done by the team every
day.

   Thanks a lot go to Gaurav who saved my sanity (and everyone else who
was being spammed as I was testing some Perl scripts that I could not
really figure out ;-).  Again, thanks Gaurav!

   Ximian folks: you no longer have to post your patches manually, we
can now use this medium of communication. 

Best wishes,
Miguel.
