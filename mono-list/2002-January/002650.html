I don't understand why company's such as Ximian are demonized when they try
to profit off of something they have invested significant resources into.  I
think the situation is very clear.  You contribute to the C# compiler and
runtime because you enjoy it.  You should understand that Ximian will at
some time try to recoup their investment.

In return, you get an open source implementation of a C# compiler and .net
runtime, which you can always use for free, forever.

When they no longer want outside contributions, they can close it up.  (but
you can always keep older snapshots and continue where they left off if
you'd like)

It is in everyone's interest for companies like Ximian to survive (companies
with an open tradition).  If it is not palatable to a person that their work
might help them profit in the future, I don't think they should contribute.

Miguel, I think you misunderstood Joe Betz's question :-)

He was asking: What guarantee do developers who hand over the copyright of
their contributions to Mono get that Ximian will not release this code under
a more restrictive license that forbids redistribution as per the terms of a
Free Software license?

Say I give you my LGPL'd code: how do I know that you won't take it and
release &lt;insert proprietary non-free application name here&gt; based on it? I
think the general consensus is that there needs to be some kind of contract
to ensure developers that their code won't be abused (to take away the
rights of other users, as RMS would put it) once the copyright has been
transfered.

Will my code stay Free in your hands or will it be proprietarized?

Thanks
