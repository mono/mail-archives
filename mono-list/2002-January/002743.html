<PRE>Kids,

I've (very) recently discovered a serious medical problem that I need to
attend to.  With that being said, I won't be around for a while to harass
y'all nearly as much, and, when I am, I will likely not have the brainpower
to be a useful contributor.

Anyhow, a quick loose end: I've written a little tool that generates enough
XML to produce a nice todo page (with percentages complete, et cetera) for
an assembly, but I haven't written the XSLT or minor tools to transform it
into readable html.  If anybody's willing to pick up my slack, take a look
at mcs/doctools.  There's a NAnt build script, but I just scratched it down
and haven't even tried to run the damn thing. ;-)

I'll be around occasionally (and probably on IRC from bed a lot ;-), and I
hope to keep sticking my fingers in Mono for a good long time to come, even
if I'm not an active contributor.


~ j.
