</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've spoken with Miguel about how the System.Data namespace should be implemented, and he sugested I post my thoughts on the mono-list.  According to the Mono site It was believed that we could just write a wrapper to GnomeDB.  After looking at the Namespace, I noticed that there has been a major overhaul to ADO, with new concepts like the DataSet, DataReaders, and the ability to synchronize a DataSet with an XmlDataDocument. I believe a wrapper to GnomeDB would have been great if ADO.NET wasn't an architectural overhaul from the previous versions of ADO.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This brings up another topic of conversation.  .NET currently has two data providers: a SQL Server Data Provider, and an OLE DB Data Provider.  I'm not very familiar with Databases and Data access on the Linux/Unix platform.  Would there need to be another Data Provider for the Linux platform?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Wow...now your talking right up my alley.  I have researched the

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For those who are use to ADO... a good comparison is the dataset is a
</I>&gt;<i> container with datatables, data relations connecting the tables.  But
</I>&gt;<i> the dataset has no cursor functionality itself.  In ADO, the
</I>&gt;<i> recordset provided a storage container (sort of) and a pointer to the
</I>&gt;<i> current row of data.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>GNOME-DB has also abandoned that cursor-oriented datasets (although they
are still possible, of course). We use data models, which seem to be
more or less similar to DataReaders. Data models are just like arrays,
with a specific value in each cell, and you can access them just by
index, as with any other array. And values can be anything, even lists
or enumerations.
