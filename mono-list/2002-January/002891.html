:<i> Okay, that would work... It would be nice as a convenience thing to have
</I>:<i> interfaces for setting parameters though. This makes it so that only one
</I>:<i> place in the code has to worry about doing proper rfc2231 encoding of
</I>:<i> parameter values and such. If the mail client has to do the encoding,
</I>:<i> you open yourself up for problems.
</I>
    Ah, I was off to my home town (city) for a day.
    I think it's a better idea. I will add something of the sort -
AddAttribute(string name, string value) / AddParameter(...).
    So, let me redefine Header class as follows:

public class Header
{
    public string Name { get; }
    public string Value { get; }

    public string this[string parameter] { get; set; }    // return value
corresponding to the parameter. null if it does not exist.

    public string ToString();    // return full header with all parameters.

    public Header(string name, string value);
    public Header(string[] nameParams, string[] values);    // nameParams[0] and
values[0] = Name and Value. All others correspond to parameters and their
values.
}

    All the methods / properties are overridable. I think this 'd be a better
structure than simply Name / Value.

:<i>
</I>:<i> Actually, I think a vector or a list of parts would be better than a
</I>:<i> Part being a linked-list node. It's possible that you may want to put a
</I>:<i> Part into multiple Messages/Multiparts/whatever. We do this a lot in
</I>:<i> Evolution for example...
</I>
    It will take a lot of time before I understand the basic architecuture of
Evolution. Just got the code from the anonymous-cvs. Though I've heard a lot
about the &quot;beauty&quot; of the code and arch of evolution, but I'll have to get used
to it. It will take at least next weekend - exams coming in. :((

:<i>
</I>:<i> Okay, I guess I just misunderstood. I think I would personally prefer
</I>:<i> &quot;Multipart&quot; rather than &quot;Body&quot; because it is more clear what the
</I>:<i> abstraction is (to someone who has read the MIME spec at least). But
</I>:<i> that's just a naming convention, it's not really important.
</I>
    That's what I said... I'll make it MultiPart - making it self explanatory
(?)

:<i> This is one mistake I made when I wrote GMime. GMimeMessage should have
</I>:<i> inherited from GMimePart, but it didn't so I'm not able to use a
</I>:<i> GMimemessage as a GMimePart :-\
</I>
    I will take care of this in my architecture. Why put extra burden.

:<i>
</I>:<i> GMime is something I wrote up in my bored spare time. It's basically a
</I>:<i> simplified Camel MIME implementation.
</I>
    Right now I'm checkout-ing the gmime from the cvs. Will see it.

:<i>
</I>:<i> Again, no problem. I'm just glad I could provide some useful input to
</I>:<i> you.
</I>:<i>
</I>:<i> Good luck, and may the source be with you ;-)
</I>
    Thanks. I am pretty confident that the source is with me and shall continue
to be with me. ;-)


Cheers,
Gaurav Vaish
