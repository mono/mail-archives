First of all i'd like to appreciate the good work that miguel and his &quot;team&quot;
are doing and for the outstanding progress they are making towards the Mono
project. I  was wondering if Dietmar (preferably) or some one in his group
could give an overview of the architecture of the &quot;runtime&quot; engine (diagrams
of the stack layout and the general flow of how IL gets processed to machine
code and the virtual execution system) with relation to the Mono source code
and some general directions on how  people need to study the source code for
the same.
Thanks
..... and keep up the good work. !!!
