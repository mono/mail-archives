&gt;<i> What's wrong with it?  I would probably adopt a similar approach.
</I>&gt;<i> My own thoughts have been to use &quot;jay&quot; for the Python grammar
</I>&gt;<i> and obtain a parse tree of the Python code to be compiled.
</I>&gt;<i> (All in C# btw). Walk the parse tree and use System.Reflection.Emit
</I>&gt;<i> to create the byte code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Well, I'm a big big fan of Python, its a wonderful prototyping tool, and
good for a wide range of web development. I am however dubious abouts it
suitability as a language in which to produce a compiler (one concern raised
by ActiveState was the slow compile times).

&gt;<i> I think that the real problems are to do with mapping the
</I>&gt;<i> semantics of Python to .NET;
</I>
I dont think this is the case (although I could well be wrong), as there
have been no problems mapping Python semantics to Java (no problems in that
it's been done, I have no idea if it was easy to do or not), as we can see
from Jython.

I'd underline the fact that we have a Java/Python implimentation that works
well and is &quot;adult&quot;. I don't see the big difference between C#/.NET and
Java/VM that would suddenly throw the whole thing into the realm of
&quot;problematic&quot; which is at the end of the day where ActiveState placed
Python.NET. To paraphrase &quot;harder than we thought, we were going to have a
crack at it but decided its not worth the resource as its running like a
dog&quot;.

&gt;<i> this I can't yet comment
</I>&gt;<i> on, I haven't researched it enough.  I was wondering about
</I>&gt;<i> doing my research by hacking MonoPython and seeing exactly
</I>&gt;<i> why it won't work :-)
</I>
Well if it wont work one has to ask why will Java/Python work and not
.NET/Python? If there's a genuine reason then its an area of concern.

Guy.
