<PRE>&gt;<i>   My only trouble with the copyright assignment was section 6(a). In the
</I>&gt;<i> world of bogus patent grants, and we do live in that world, I cannot
</I>&gt;<i> easily know if my work can subject Ximian to a suit. As an individual
</I>&gt;<i> copyright owner, I am not an attractive target for a large corporation
</I>&gt;<i> seeking to assert its patent rights. However, as part of the Mono
</I>&gt;<i> runtime, which I did want to contribute to but declined after reading
</I>&gt;<i> 6(a), I am part of a much larger, more attractive target. If some third
</I>&gt;<i> party gains a bogus patent similar to work I do for Ximian, an event I
</I>&gt;<i> can easily imagine, then suddenly I have agreed to compensate Ximian
</I>&gt;<i> should it not prevail in the suit.

Ok, I went and got a copy of the copyright assignment form.  Section 6.a
does not talk about patents, it talks about you stating that you are the
copyright holder (ie, you are giving us permission to use *your* code,
you are not giving someone else's rights to us).

This is not related in any way to patents.  

Miguel.
