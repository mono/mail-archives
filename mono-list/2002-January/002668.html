<PRE>If they relicense it, it only effects what they release. Older versions
are still GPL, and you can continue to use/work on the gpled version as
long as you'd like.

</I>&gt;<i> Ximian, well, you all would win every time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But consider the following scenario:  I write a lexical parser (let's

</I>&gt;<i> is Open Source or Free or whatever, so the only freedom I loose by doing
</I>&gt;<i> so is the freedom to relicense my lexer.  I, or anybody else, can still
</I>&gt;<i> modify it and use it in as many different projects as needed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But what if now Ximian changes the license to &quot;you can only use this
</I>&gt;<i> code if you pay Miguel de Icaza two-hundred gorgan-zillian dollars&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> which would be in Ximian's rights to do.  Could Ximian make this license
</I>&gt;<i> change retroactive?  Let me be more specific: if Ximian has owned the
</I>&gt;<i> copyright to my lexer since version 1.2, can they say that all software
</I>&gt;<i> that uses a version of my lexer later than 1.2 (which may be /years/ old
</I>&gt;<i> at this point) has to fork over money to Miguel or be sued?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that they can (though not that they would).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So then my problem becomes, do I donate my lexer to Ximian, knowing that
</I>&gt;<i>   /any other/ project I use it in may be put in jeopardy if Ximian
</I>&gt;<i> changes the lexer's license, as they have the right to do?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I didn't have some sort of legal guarantee that Ximian would not make
</I>&gt;<i> retroactive changes to my code's license, the only code I would donate
</I>&gt;<i> to Ximian would be code that I was sure I was never going to use
</I>&gt;<i> anywhere else.  That doesn't sound like quality code to me.
