    I see it now.  corlib.build is excluding System.Resources.  When I
    removed the exclusion, I got a slew of errors.  Basically those classes
    haven't got all the methods they need for the interfaces from which they
    inherit.
    
    Can you fix this so at least the build isn't broken when we include that
    directory?

I'm the one that wrote all that code in System.Resources. I checked in
what I had back in December and I know they aren't complete yet, so I
added them to the exclude list to not break the build.

My laptop is busted right now and I won't be able to have it fixed until
next week, or maybe even later. In the mean time, please feel free to
fix anything you see, I don't have any pending patches.

My reading of the beta2 spec is that System.Resources is one of the
sections that hasn't been completely spec'd out yet. There are multiple
methods in the Beta2 SDK that didn't have any documentation to it.

I was just browsing the Class Library resources at MSDN and noticed that
they might have updated their documentation and added some new methods.
So maybe the docs are all in there now. I'll start working on it once my
laptop is up and running again.

Thanks,

Duncan.
