<PRE>&gt;<i> After reading quite a bit about the mono project, I am interested to &quot;see it
</I>&gt;<i> in action&quot;.  From my understanding (based on reading the mailing lists and
</I>&gt;<i> the go-mono web page), I should be able to download a current snapshot and
</I>&gt;<i> build it.  Unfortunately, I am running into trouble even getting started.  I
</I>&gt;<i> have some familiarity with Linux/UNIX, but I primary develop on windows,
</I>&gt;<i> where I am trying to build mono.
</I>
Building Mono on Windows is known to be hard.  Nick Drochak has been
trying to get a few build errors fixed, but we have not figured them
all.  Check the mailing list for details.

&gt;<i> Your daily snapshots seem to be missing the configure file under the mono
</I>&gt;<i> directory (there is one there in the 0.7 release).  I tried using the old
</I>&gt;<i> one from the 0.7 release, and it successfully ran, but the the &quot;make&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> command mad errors in the io-layer directory.
</I>
The configure file is generated by the `autogen.sh' script.  Snapshots
only contain the master files, on the other hand the &quot;releases&quot; are
ready-to compile packages.

&gt;<i> Also, I was wondering:  are nant, etc. are able to run (without re-compile)
</I>&gt;<i> under post-beta 2 versions of the .NET SDK?  I am running v1.0.3512.  I was
</I>&gt;<i> able to compile mcs, but running it (or nant) gives me errors... it seemed
</I>&gt;<i> to have trouble finding the right version of the system.dll library.  I have
</I>&gt;<i> the beta 2 SDK somewhere, if it is not supposed to be forward compatible.
</I>
I think the Nant binary fails to run on RC0.  Someone posted a fix to
the mailing list for this, but most of us are still using Beta2, so we
have not bothered to upgrade Nant.exe

&gt;<i> Please forgive me if this is the wrong place to ask this, and forward this
</I>&gt;<i> request on to the right person.
</I>
The mailing list usually works better, because this alias is moderated.

Miguel.
