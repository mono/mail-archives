Hi,
 
Last week when I was dealing with my .NET course homework assignment, I had a problem when running the program with Mono 1.2.5.1.
 
The assignment was about creating a user control that shows the file system hierarchy on the left in a TreeView, and the contents of a selected directory on the right in a ListView. I started the solution in Visual Studio 2008 Beta 2, and everything worked fine on it. Then I thought it might be fun to try running the program on Mono without recompiling, but then I had a problem with a file called &quot;pagefile.sys&quot;, which is a [+archive][+hidden][+system] page file for caching. The program ran fine on Mono (on Windows XP SP2), except that when it came across this file, whose path is @&quot;F:\pagefile.sys&quot;, it raised an exception saying that the file was not found, in System.IO.FileInfo.get_Length(). That was confusing because no problem occured when running the program with .NET Framework 3.5 Beta 2. I tried to avoid the exception by filtering out files with [+hidden] and [+system] attributes before a call to this FileInfo.Length was made, but what's strange is that the same exception still got raised. I don't the problem had anything to do with those attributes, though, because when browsing drive C:\ there were files with the same attributes, but didn't raise an exception.
 
So I fired up SharpDevelop, started a new solution and copied the code into it, and then compiled the solution with Mono 1.2.5.1, and still got the same result. I tried the program in openSUSE 10.2 with Mono 1.2.5.1, too, somehow there were different exceptions, probably because I didn't log in as root, and didn't have enough privilege to access those directories/files.
 
Could anyone shed me some light on this? I've attached the solution here: <A HREF="http://download.yousendit.com/60C0C5630B95DBAC,">http://download.yousendit.com/60C0C5630B95DBAC,</A> in case anyone's interested in reproducing the bug.Greetings,- RednaxelaFX
