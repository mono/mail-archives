<PRE>Thanks for your helpful response, Eric.

&gt;<i>Does anyone know if the gtk# libraries can be used in silverlight /
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;moonlight? If not, what should I be using for GUI construction? It
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;looks like Windows Forms are going to be somewhat deprecated in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; favour of WPF/e.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Silverlight is the new name for WPF/e, so please use this name. On mono
</I>&gt;<i> that will be Moonlight. This is strictly web technology. It's also quite
</I>&gt;<i> limited and you can't make much of an application with it yet. It's
</I>&gt;<i> supposed to work along with ASP.NET which will provide the &quot;standard web
</I>&gt;<i> style&quot; functionality.
</I>

Thanks for the clarification of terms and also maturity/status.

I don't want to burst your bubble, but php and Python or Ruby on Rails
&gt;<i> would be about a hundred times easier for you to master if you don't
</I>&gt;<i> know any .NET today. I love .NET but I admit the learning curve is
</I>&gt;<i> steep.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You'd have to learn C#, the .NET Framework including ADO.NET, ASP.NET,
</I>&gt;<i> and Silverlight/Moonlight. That's a big job for you.
</I>


Thanks for that info. So, just to clarify:

WPF/e is different to WPF. The first is Silverlight, the second is a fat
client.

Neither GTK# nor WPF is particularly more able to be deployed in
Silverlight/Moonlight. They are both intended for desktop apps and neither
is a universal framework.

As such, the choice between GTK# and WPF would be on their relative merits
for desktop applications.

Given that, it may be somewhat pointless to use .NET. I might as well use
regular CPython with GTK. I won't get a web application for free by using
.NET and I might as well minimise my pain.

That said, .NET with IronPython and GTK# might be a better desktop framework
than CPython and GTK, but that's a different question.

Thanks,
-Tennessee
