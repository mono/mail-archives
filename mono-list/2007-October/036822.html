<PRE>&gt;<i> What problems are you having?
</I>
This is part of a larger proof of concept we are doing on Linux running on 
Z series hardware. I suggested trying to port some of our aspx websites to 
the POC as well; in the middle of trying to get it up and running this is 
what I am running into.

When I try to install several of the rpms I get a Failed dependencies 
error for mono(System.Windows.Forms) and mono(System.Web); for example:

suse:~/software/mono # rpm -ivh mono-web-1.2.5.1-0.novell.s390x.rpm
error: Failed dependencies:
        mono(System.Windows.Forms) = 2.0.0.0 is needed by 
mono-web-1.2.5.1-0.novell
suse:~/software/mono #
suse:~/software/monoweb # rpm -ivh xsp-1.2.5-2.novell.noarch.rpm
error: Failed dependencies:
        mono(System.Web) = 1.0.5000.0 is needed by xsp-1.2.5-2.novell
        mono(System.Web) = 2.0.0.0 is needed by xsp-1.2.5-2.novell
        mono(System.Web.Services) = 1.0.5000.0 is needed by 
xsp-1.2.5-2.novell
suse:~/software/monoweb #
