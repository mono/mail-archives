&gt;<i>So IronPython is not part of Silverlight 1.0, and neither is the 
</I>&gt;<i>.NET runtime -- those are both part of Silverlight 1.1 (unless/until 
</I>&gt;<i>things change, as things tend to).
</I>
That's not a concern that IronPython is only available with 1.1. Most of
us have jumped straight to 1.1 and we're bypassing 1.0 because we really
want to play with the mini-CLR that runs in the browser. The 1.0
JavaScript-only solution isn't very attractive to most .NET coders.

1.1 is also being enhanced to include more controls so it might be quite
useful by the time of its official release. Even if Microsoft doesn't
include a *lot* of controls I'm sure there will be many open source
controls that can &quot;add on&quot; to what Microsoft provides.

Silverlight/Moonlight is the most exciting new web technology ever since
ASP.NET was initially released. And thankfully Microsoft has noticed the
interest in it and they've got many of their best people working on it.
