<PRE>Hi there.

I'm a .Net developer and recently started to evaluate Virtualbox [1]. 
Their guys are quite friendly and helpful on IRC and told me that apart 
from the native C++ samples using their XPCom api there are some other 
samples as well - like the one Miguel postet on his blog [2]. Obviously 
he got it from Jonathan (whose blog is linked from that entry, see [3]).

I had the somewhat stupid idea to drop into the mono irc channel some 
time ago and ask if one of those guys is available and was sent back to 
this ml.

I'd love to get my hands on the samples that support those blog entries 
and it would be awesome if someone has a small, short introduction on this 
topic (but the source on its own would be more than enough, of course). Is 
there any chance to get this stuff from one of you guys? Is this the right 
place to discuss about (app-specific) xpcom stuff?

Regards and thanks in advance,
Ben
