<PRE>Zac Bowling escribi&#243;:
&gt;<i> I seen one in Java that monitored network activity with a JNI wrapper
</I>&gt;<i> for a bittorent client. It would involve looking up and querying your
</I>&gt;<i> network interfaces which would be different most certainly from platform
</I>&gt;<i> to platform, and writing one that way.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However that implementation is only good for one client. The thing with
</I>&gt;<i> BITS is that it's a single process queuing service, so if multiple
</I>&gt;<i> clients want to use it, they can all get a fraction of the idle
</I>&gt;<i> bandwidth to pool together. However, the idea is totally possible and I
</I>&gt;<i> would love to see an implementation written. It would take a few native
</I>&gt;<i> hooks for each platform and some skill to make a shared daemon that all
</I>&gt;<i> the client processes queue up with over some type of IPC. Not a
</I>&gt;<i> difficult concept at all, just nobody has done it yet :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some things to think about:
</I>&gt;<i> * error control (what if the bandwidth picks up again, do you drop the
</I>&gt;<i> connection? how do you let the client lib handle that?)
</I>&gt;<i> * should be like a socket proxy or just purely handle http? (are you
</I>&gt;<i> going to proxy any type of socket for the client, or are you going to
</I>&gt;<i> support purely an http implementation? both have trade offs and
</I>&gt;<i> considerations.. things like FTP and HTTP can be restarted mid stream
</I>&gt;<i> with some servers so you can pick up where you left off. You could even
</I>&gt;<i> go the route of writing a transaction like wrapper and handling only
</I>&gt;<i> request queue messages)
</I>&gt;<i> * security (pretty simple if done correctly, but you don't want to make
</I>&gt;<i> it an open proxy like the first BITS version basically was in Windows
</I>&gt;<i> 2000)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hope that helps (and maybe inspires) :-)
</I>
Thanks for all your ideas, they clarify a lot.

I will let you know if I get any advance in this subject.

Regards.
