<PRE>Thanks,

I was worried about the debugging thing.  The best thing I can think
of is implementing fairly heavy log4net style logging.

This leads me to another question on the conf files for the service. I
know typically linux service oriented apps place configuration files
into /etc/.  With .NET apps defaulting to &lt;appname&gt;.dll.config in the
same dir as the executable, is the standard approach to symlink the
config file to a proper location in /etc/?

My target platform for production is SuSe though I have a couple of
other flavors in the engineering to QA to production loop still
(Gentoo/RHEL).

Thanks,

-n

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have been trawling the list archives and the mono site on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recommended approach for writing / deploying a windows service to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; target linux but haven't been able to find a good reference.
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;good reference&quot; depends pretty much on the Linux distribution you

</I>&gt;<i> about Novell's SuSE Linux; I managed to get it working on Fedora Core
</I>&gt;<i> (and Solaris) based on that, using documentation for native
</I>&gt;<i> daemons/services.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What is the current recommended approach for developing and deploying
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; services with mono on linux?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Basically I am looking to port a windows service so that it runs via
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; /etc/init.d/natesnuclearservice start | stop | restart etc.
</I>&gt;<i> Usually this involves having a distribution-specific shell script that
</I>&gt;<i> spawns mono-service (or mono-service2 for .NET 2.0) and interacts with
</I>&gt;<i> it via PID and signals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> During initial development getting your service to work can be a little
</I>&gt;<i> tricky as exceptions or Mono crashes are not logged. You might need to
</I>&gt;<i> figure out how to manually call Mono with the managed mono-service class
</I>&gt;<i> to see its output on the console.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for deployment, that depends on the system as well - so far I've only
</I>&gt;<i> worked with Solaris packages but it should also be possible through RPMs
</I>&gt;<i> or Debian packages just like installing native daemons.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I saw a few threads refer to a mono-service but they seemed a couple
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; years old?
</I>&gt;<i> The most up-to-date mono-service options are available through &quot;man
</I>&gt;<i> mono-service&quot;. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> And no, there are also more recent posts on this topic, e.g. by me
</I>&gt;<i> around February, also some earlier related posts on the topic of running
</I>&gt;<i> XSP as daemon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> HTH,
