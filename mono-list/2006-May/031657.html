</I>
Thats a point against my patch.

&gt;<i> OTOH, if you insert a string that can't be parsed as a DateTime, a

</I>&gt;<i> Mono.Data.SqliteClient.SqliteDataReader (with or without the patch)

</I>&gt;<i> aggressively convert doubles to DateTimes too, which would partially get 
</I>&gt;<i> around the problem above.) 
</I>
That's a point against the existing implementation.

&gt;<i> The next best thing we can do, I think, is to have GetSchemaTable return 
</I>&gt;<i> the result of GetFieldType.  GetFieldType is implemented to look at the 
</I>&gt;<i> first row of the result set and return the type of the object it's 
</I>&gt;<i> actually going to return (or to return typeof(string) if the result set 
</I>&gt;<i> is empty).  This way, so long as the column contains fields of a 
</I>&gt;<i> consistent type, it'll be ok.  However, even this is possible to mess 
</I>&gt;<i> up.  If I declare the column as INT and then insert first an integer and 
</I>&gt;<i> then a string (let's say by accident), a FormatException is thrown in 
</I>&gt;<i> AbstractDataContainer when reading it back. 
</I>
That's a point against this proposed fix.

&gt;<i> Lastly, since SqliteDataReader buffers all of the results, a solution 
</I>&gt;<i> could be to return a type that surely all of the values in a column can 
</I>&gt;<i> be converted to.  If a double is found in a DATETIME column, it could 
</I>&gt;<i> automatically return typeof(string) and convert all of the values 
</I>&gt;<i> appropriately.  However, this would be doing a lot of behind-the-scenes 
</I>&gt;<i> conversions that don't seem too friendly. 
</I>
That sounds horrible.

&gt;<i> So my inclination after all of this is to recommend not using the 
</I>&gt;<i> DataTable class with Sqlite.  But what do you say? 
</I>
That's a cop-out :-)

What about putting in some type checking when the data is _written_ to the 
database, instead? OK, it wouldn't stop exceptions being thrown if the data 
was written by a some other app, but at least it would make things work 
consistently.

&gt;<i> And finally, if there's really a bug in DateTime.Parse reversing the 
</I>&gt;<i> dates on non-US locales, fixing that might make all of this moot (for 
</I>&gt;<i> your application, at least).
</I>
That would help - at least I could put in some MONO-specific code which 
would work for my application.

Could I have a copy of the test code you used to try all this out? I want 
to run it on the Microsoft/Finisar version, to see what happens.
