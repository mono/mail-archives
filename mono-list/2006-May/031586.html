<PRE>Hello,

We have an application we have written that we are having problems with
it locking up. This is a command line application that runs continuously
with lots of threads. The lock ups are completely random as far as we
can tell. Sometimes it may take 10 minutes, and sometimes it can take up
to 1-2 hours before it locks up. All threads appear to stop running, but
the process never stops and we never see any exceptions thrown.

What is the best way to pursue troubleshooting this. We have tried
different approaches such as using mono --trace and Console.WriteLines,
but have made no significant steps forward.

Here's the details about the server:
Linux 2.6.16-1.2096_FC5 #1 SMP Wed Apr 19 05:14:26 EDT 2006 x86_64

Mono JIT compiler version 1.1.13.4, (C) 2002-2005 Novell, Inc and Contributors. www.mono-project.com
        TLS:           __thread
        GC:            Included Boehm (with typed GC)
        SIGSEGV      : normal

This is the version of mono that ships with Fedora Core 5.

Thanks for any help,
Eric
