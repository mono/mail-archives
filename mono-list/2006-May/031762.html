That's good news - I guess things will improve rapidly then.

&gt;<i> &gt; Therefore, the application has a single Canvas on which it does all its

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; window goes away, but mono doesn't terminate. As this is a critical 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; application which must be restarted immediately if it exits, this is the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; last straw. 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Try Environment.Exit. Additionally, you may debug the application

Thanks - we're doing that (but it was making us uncomfortable, along with all 
the other problems we are getting).

&gt;<i> &gt; I have been asked to look into the possibility of doing away with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Windows.Forms altogether. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Windows.Forms is clearly an interface between the application and GTK. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Would it be reasonably easy to bypass Windows.Forms, and use the existing 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GTK interface instead? 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> SWF is not based on GTK. 
</I>
Ah, I see. Is it based on anything I can usefully get at?

&gt;<i> Anyhow, here you go: <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/GtkSharp">http://www.mono-project.com/GtkSharp</A> 
</I>
Thanks again. Will discuss this with the boss.

I must say, Mono may have more obvious bugs than .NET, but it has a _very_ 
helpful developer community!
