The boilerplate just states that the implementation of
a certain class is not thread safe. It doesn't mean that
the underlying technology is not thread safe.

</I>
It's common sense that [Begin|End]Receive[From] and
[Begin|End]Send[To] are thread safe.

[In MS.NET 2.0, the Socket class is even marked as thread safe.]

&gt;<i> The case I am working with is the following: two hosts have a socket

</I>&gt;<i> them.  At any time one or the other may send data.  What is the lowest

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If anyone else has some good pointers on how to use one socket to send and

</I>
Supposing the reads &amp; writes are highly interdependent, using
asynchronous methods is the fastest way. Having separate threads
for reading and writing needs thread synchronization and leads
to a context switch.

The async methods used by the Socket class are handled differently
by the runtime. They are not invoked from the generic TP. The Socket
IO is handled by a specialized thread using AIO APIs.

BTW, the TP issues have been fixed in the meanwhile:
