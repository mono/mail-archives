Is this really true?  I assume you mean posix aio methods?  When I look in
the mono source I can't find where this is happening.  Am I missing it?  It
appeared to me that the asynchronous methods were being implemented with
threading in mono and the standard synchronous socket calls.

Can you provide a reference (file names/line numbers) for the aio code in
mono?


&gt;<i> BTW, the TP issues have been fixed in the meanwhile:

Yeah I have seen that, but when I start many asynchronous calls (30-50)
between  many sockets in many different threads which are sending a lot of
data back and fourth, I get problems which I don't get if I work with
Socket.Poll (it appears some of the threads are deadlocked).  I know that's
a vague statement and not sufficient for a bug report, but I am still
dubious that the asynchronous code is robust enough to be used in my setting
(P2P code used in research).

Best Regards,
