</I>&gt;<i> on a Mac or Linux box?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> And one more question - at the very start of the FAQ, it lists a bunch
</I>&gt;<i> of different libraries. The first few have links, but most don't ...
</I>&gt;<i> where do I get these other libraries from? (like Mono.Data, Mono.XML ...)
</I>The Gtk# Installers for .NET Framework do include some Mono specific
libraries that are installed on the GAC and are made visible to Visual
Studio so your projects can easily make reference to them.  Over time,
and with the help and feedback from the community, we may add more
libraries to the MS GAC and VS if appropriate or deemed necessary.

The earlier reply from Jon Pryor is a must read.  There is a small
addition to the resources that Jon mentioned in his email,
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Working_with_Mono_and_Visual_Studio.">http://www.mono-project.com/Working_with_Mono_and_Visual_Studio.</A>

There will be more to come in the near future as we try to bring more of
Mono and MonoDevelop on Windows systems through the presence of a &quot;Mono
Appliance&quot; running with the VMware Player that can be use to complement
VSPrj2make.
