Though it is not the cause of the problem, this is not an appropriate way
to build a path. You should use the Path.Combine method:

S.D.Image Backdrop = S.D.Image.FromFile(System.IO.Path.Combine(&quot;Images&quot;,
&quot;Backdrop.jpg&quot;));

Though it is bad form, you could actually simply hardcode a &quot;/&quot; as well;
Windows does actually support it in all the underlying APIs, even though
the front-end user interface usually insists on &quot;\&quot;s.

If this image isn't going to change, ever, though, then the best course of
action would be to embed it as a resource; that way, there's no chance of
it going missing, and you don't need to worry about path separator
characters at all :-)

S.D.Image Backdrop = S.D.Image.FromStream(
  GetType().Assembly.GetManifestResourceStream(&quot;Backdrop.jpg&quot;));

Note that if you embed it using Visual Studio, then the name will be
prefixed with the name of your assembly. If your project is called
&quot;MDIWithBackdrop&quot;, then you'd actually need to pass
&quot;MDIWithBackdrop.Backdrop.jpg&quot; to Assembly.GetManifestStream().

In order to embed it with Visual Studio, add it to the project, and then in
the Solution Explorer, right click on the file and select &quot;Properties&quot;.
Then, in the properties panel, change the Build Action from &quot;None&quot; to
&quot;Embedded Resource&quot;.

&gt;<i> Now this code works fine running it directly from Visual Studio (in
</I>&gt;<i> Windows). However (using the VSPrj2Make add-in), when I test it with
</I>&gt;<i> Mono (1.1.15), the backdrop image appears on the toolbar instead!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do I need to do this differently in Mono?
</I>
This is almost certainly a bug in Managed.Windows.Forms; your program
should magically begin to work (without even recompiling) when it is fixed.
Probably someone closer to the core of M.W.F development will respond to
confirm this.
