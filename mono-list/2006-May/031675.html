Yes, Mono does need to be installed on the machine that will be expected
run an application that requires the Mono runtime.  It is possible to
create executable files that package in them all the functionality that
would otherwise would be searched and match at runtime against the Mono
Global Assembly Cache.  You may want to research one of Mono's tools
called mkbundle.  Do this by typing mkbundle --help or by using man
pages like so:

man mkbundle.

However, if you are planning deploying your applications in Windows you
could be using Gtk# Installers for MS .NET Framework.  There is also a
new project I have been working on that may interest you.  It is an
application packager or rather an Installer creator with Mono Win32
application deployment in mind.  You could learn a bit more here:

Hope this helps,
