<PRE>My RHEL-based host (now shifting from BSD) is quite large and supports
thousands of domains. Based on a recent inquiry I made I understand they
are now looking into hosting Mono for new and existing customers.

Is there a document somewhere that targets this specific audience with
information about the concerns for shared hosts?

We have plenty of disk with this host - is the Linux Installer an option
for individual installs?  We don't have shell access so we'd need to do all
command-line operations via remote/cron-executed scripts.

Some dependencies and components would need to be removed, since for
example, we don't need Gtk# on a system that's not serving thick-client
apps, and they're running Apache and we wouldn't be able to run XSP.

This could be a big opportunity for Mono to get some exposure with a major
host.  I'm just wondering how secure and stable it would be in this sort of
environment.  Does anyone build installers or RPMs that are oriented toward
this focus audience?

Thanks.

</PRE>
