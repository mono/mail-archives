<PRE>I am a late arrival to a project trying to do serious work with Mono. It 
has been accepted since before I arrived that Mono's Windows.Forms was 
buggy, and its use should be kept to a minimum. 

Therefore, the application has a single Canvas on which it does all its 
GUI. Windows.Forms is only used to get keyboard and paint messages.

Recently we have discovered that Application.Exit doesn't always exit - the 
window goes away, but mono doesn't terminate. As this is a critical 
application which must be restarted immediately if it exits, this is the 
last straw.

I have been asked to look into the possibility of doing away with 
Windows.Forms altogether. 

Windows.Forms is clearly an interface between the application and GTK. 
Would it be reasonably easy to bypass Windows.Forms, and use the existing 
GTK interface instead?

Any advice would be appreciated.
