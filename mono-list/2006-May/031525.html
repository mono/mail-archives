<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Lately I received an interesting question from Japanese users:
</I>&gt;<i> To run ASP.NET applications there are xsp and mod_mono. So, how
</I>&gt;<i> is xsp performance good or bad as compared to mod_mono + xsp ?
</I>&gt;<i> Did anyone tried to compare them?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The question is pretty loose, so I'd appreciate any degree of
</I>&gt;<i> infos. (I'm not asking only to Gonzalo as there are some other
</I>&gt;<i> guys who manage to run their web apps.)
</I>
One important point to keep in mind is that XSP implements HTTP 1.0 and
a few other nuggets, but is not a complete HTTP server implementation.

Proper clients that expect to take advantage of some HTTP 1.1 features
(like keep alive connections) will not get this behavior (I think we
might have added a hack, but it is still not a full 1.1 server).

When XSP is used with mod_mono, Apache acts as a front-end to implement
the full HTTP 1.1 stack, and in addition provides a lot of extra
features on top of it that are just not available from XSP (like
mime-type mapping to specific handlers, using sendfile to send static
file contents and so much more).

Miguel.
</PRE>
