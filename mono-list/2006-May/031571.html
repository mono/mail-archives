<PRE>Hi, I'm just looking into Mono, and trying to get a handle on exactly what is there, and what I need to do. First of all, I gather there's currently no Mono IDE for a Windows environment? I did glance at the MonoDevelop page, but it said it's only for Linux and Mac - is there any plans/timeline for this to be extended to Windows? Or is there another IDE I'm missing?

Anyway, without a Mono IDE I guess I'm looking at using Visual Studio. (I realize I could use gtk#/Glade - but I'd rather have a full blown IDE, even if it means a bit more hassle when it comes to deploying). Now, I read the FAQ, and it said that I could still code in Visual Studio, and have my program run using Mono (as long as I avoided anything specific to .Net 2.0). But I'm unclear on how that applies to multi-platform deployment ... what would be involved in getting my program (writting in Visual Studio under Windows) running on a Mac or Linux box?

And one more question - at the very start of the FAQ, it lists a bunch of different libraries. The first few have links, but most don't ... where do I get these other libraries from? (like Mono.Data, Mono.XML ...)

Thanks,
Glen.
