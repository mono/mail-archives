<PRE>Hi,

I am new to this forum and the topic of mono so first of all: Hi at all!

I want to build mono in a buildroot environment to be able to program .net
applications for an embedded device. I use the mono source package
mono-2.8.1
(<A HREF="http://download.mono-project.com/sources/mono/mono-2.8.1.tar.bz2">http://download.mono-project.com/sources/mono/mono-2.8.1.tar.bz2</A>) which is
build via Autobuild. The build is done in the following steps (as usual):

- Download the sourcecode
- Extract the archive
- Patch some files
- Configure (with --prefix option)
- Make
- Install (also with DESTDIR) 

After the successful compilation (complete project size app. 500 MB) the
installation process beginns. Some files are copied to the target dir, but
unfortunately only ~30 MB are copied. In the error logs (make + install)
nothing explicit can be found (some warnings, some issues, but nothing too
bad) and it seems all the files are build correctly.
After installation I observed that the directory /usr/lib/mono is missing
(or whatever prefix I use) and therefor all the necessary libs are missing.
Nearly only executables are installed and I wonder abour the problem. When
trying to run some compiled program via mono I only get the message:

The assembly mscorlib.dll was not found or could not be loaded.
It should have been installed in the `/usr/lib/mono/2.0/mscorlib.dll'
directory.

(which is clear because no /usr/lib/mono dir exists...) Nevertheless, if I
search for mscorlib.dll on my computer I find it in the build directory (but
not in the install folder).

Has anybody any idea for the reason? I already checked the internet but
found nothing useful.

Thanks and regards
Sycko
