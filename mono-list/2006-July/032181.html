That's probably because you're a top poster, who is used to seeing the most 
recent information first. Us traditional bottom posters expect information in 
chronological order, top to bottom. :-) :-) :-)

&gt;<i> Note that if you report a bug using bugzilla you don't have to post it to 
</I>&gt;<i> the list as well. I just tried to answer your question in subject: &quot;Is this 
</I>&gt;<i> a new bug?&quot; 
</I>
I thought the information would be useful to other list users, as it is a nasty 
bug which could catch anyone out, and which is only revealed by careful 
testing. I would certainly like to have known about it in advance, and I 
haven't found anywhere in bugzilla where you can get a programmer-friendly list 
of bugs which might bite you.

However, if the list isn't the right place to post this kind of heads up 
warning, please let me know, and I will desist.
