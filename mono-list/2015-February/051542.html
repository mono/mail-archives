<PRE>&gt;<i>From my understanding, it comes down to generalizing over number
</I>operations, not about creating a number type hierarchy.

You could create a type hierarchy, but you wouldn't be able to use natural
operators, you'd need to use interface methods like a.Add(b).

I'm pretty sure that you could create an interface that represents the
major number operations, and then create structs that implement that
interface and wrap the main number types without touching anything in the
runtime like native types needed to do.
