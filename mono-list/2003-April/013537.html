<PRE>Hello, I need to get SOAP calls working in a portable way in my .NET code
real soon now, and since I'll be jumping the gun on Mono's webservices
implementation a bit, I was wondering if anyone had a good idea for how to
do it in the meantime, or had already gone down this path and could give a
tip?  The best idea I've had so far is to bind my interfaces to EasySoap++
in C++ (I've had good success with EasySoap++ in the past for C++ projects)
then export them as C functions which I could P/Invoke with Mono via a C#
binding.  Maybe someone out there has already wrapped a C lib for SOAP for
this purpose, which would probably be a better strategy (Does such a lib
exist?  SOUP's SOAP seems dead and OpenSoap seems unusably complex).  Any
ideas welcome!  I'm determined to get my code running on Mono. :)
