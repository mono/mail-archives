<PRE>Hi there,

I have been following this mailinglist, news about mono and releases for
some time now. All that reading made me interested in helping you guys
getting the mono .NET implementation a great development environment.

I am a employed .NET developer, a hobby GNOME developer and long-time
Linux user and developer. I have installed both Windows XP Home (which I
mounted on /mnt/windows) and RedHat 9.0 with all development packages
that I can think of.

What I want to know .. 

* Where can I find information on building the CVS-tree of Mono (all
it's components). It looks like a simple ./autogen.sh &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make
install does not (always) work. So is there information available? 

* What development environment is used? For Linux development I always
use Anjuta and I know (from the Anjuta mailinglist) that C#-support is
being worked on. Are there at this moment editors for Linux which
support stuff like code-completion and C# syntax highligthing? And what
development environment can I use on Windows ? I own a copy of Visual
Studio.NET but how should I set it up to make it start using the
Mono-framework?

* Which parts/sub projects of Mono can actually use my help? I have
experience in developing Java, C, C#, VB.NET, C++ with Visual Studio,
PHP, GNOME and Gtk+, GNOME2.x and Gtk+-2.x. Where should I start?!
Please be very specific :)

* I guess these questions have been asked a lot .. maybe, if it has been
answered a lot, there is a FAQ for questions like this? If thats the
case: where can I find it?
