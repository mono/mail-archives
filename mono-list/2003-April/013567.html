<PRE>Rogue Wave has some C++ web service product that I heard was cross platform, lightweight, flexible and easy to use. I would check them out.

Subject: [Mono-list] SOAP 'alternative' for temporary use with Mono?


Hello, I need to get SOAP calls working in a portable way in my .NET code real soon now, and since I'll be jumping the gun on Mono's webservices implementation a bit, I was wondering if anyone had a good idea for how to do it in the meantime, or had already gone down this path and could give a tip?  The best idea I've had so far is to bind my interfaces to EasySoap++ in C++ (I've had good success with EasySoap++ in the past for C++ projects) then export them as C functions which I could P/Invoke with Mono via a C# binding.  Maybe someone out there has already wrapped a C lib for SOAP for this purpose, which would probably be a better strategy (Does such a lib exist?  SOUP's SOAP seems dead and OpenSoap seems unusably complex).  Any ideas welcome!  I'm determined to get my code running on Mono. :)
