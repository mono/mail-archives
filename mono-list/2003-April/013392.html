<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> I think that Mono is targetting mainly the Desktop Application developers 
</I>&gt;<i> and the Web Application developers. No criticism here, just expressing 
</I>&gt;<i> reality as I see it.
</I>
Although that is *my* major interest, plenty of the work done in Mono is
not done for the desktop sake, but for the larger universe of
applications (see System.Web as a proof).

&gt;<i> I'm trying to work on filling this gap in Mono. It's just that I'm feeling a 
</I>&gt;<i> bit lonely here. Are there any other EA archs/devs around here?
</I>
The main problem I see with MonoQLE is that it lacks a number of
elements:

	* An architecture document.

	* Any sort of working code.

	* Any sort of samples.

	* An active developer.

It is not sufficient to create a project on SourceForge.  For a project
to be successful, you have to be ready to devote hundreds of hours of
your time to get it off the ground.  

This is one of the most common mistakes with a lot of projects out
there: they might have a grand vision, but they do not have any code. 
The only way you can get MonoQLE to take off is by getting it off the
ground yourself.

Miguel.
