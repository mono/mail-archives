AFAIK there is no option to make 100% sure that MS produces shared code,

We already do that, but this does not solve the problem with multiple
domains and shared code. So it is not faster, or I don't understand what
you talk about.

&gt;<i> &gt; My suggestion is to modify mcs to produce the same code as csc, which

</I>&gt;<i> But this would not solve the issue, since one can always write the

</I>
Well, &quot;correct&quot; is the wrong word - this is just how you define correct
behaviour. I think using the C# compiler to handle the issue is much
cleaner solution that implementing those strange hidden runtime
features.

An performance of that approach is faster, because you only slow down
code which uses switch statements on strings (which is quite seldom),
whereas the other approach slows down code all code containing ldstr
opcodes.
