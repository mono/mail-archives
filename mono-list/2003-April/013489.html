<PRE>There are several reasons for this.

First of all, Gtk+ and Qt are standard toolkits on Linux, and their
proponents want to use their favorite toolkits when writing
applications.

Possibly related to this is the idea that Windows.Forms is brain-dead in
certain areas, such as internationalization.  Windows.Forms uses
explicit sizes for all controls, as opposed to Gtk+ and Qt which use a
box/packing model, which can better deal with the different string
lengths different languages will have.

Next is compatibility.  It is not possible to implement Windows.Forms on
top of Gtk+/Qt and have 100% compatibility, because Windows.Forms
exposes *lots* of Win32-isms, such as the Win32 message loop.  In order
to maintain compatibility, Wine must be used, and this is being done.

However, Wine apps don't currently fit in -- visually -- with Gtk+ or Qt
apps.

Those, AFAIK, are the primary reasons.  People don't like the
Windows.Forms API, and using it would limit us to using Wine under
Linux.

As for SharpDevelop, I have no idea when that'll be complete.  Last I
heard they were porting SWT (the Ecplipse toolkit from IBM) to C#, after
which they'll re-write SharpDevelop to use SWT.
