<PRE>Hello,

The problem I have in general with stubbed classes is that it gives the
wrong impression that code is there.

Sometimes stubs are required to get other pieces working or moving, but
I dislike the idea of just stubbing classes for the sake of it.  

This is a case where we are better off without the stubs, until we have
a real implementation.   

For example, instead of having 200 classes stubbed, I would like to have
a single class implemented from that collection.   People who need the
other classes will likely appreciate being able to stub it themselves,
and at the same time get a big picture of what they need to work on, as
opposed to &quot;filling in&quot; one or two methods.

Miguel.
