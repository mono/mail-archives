<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Hello, I need to get SOAP calls working in a portable way in my .NET code
</I>&gt;<i> real soon now, and since I'll be jumping the gun on Mono's webservices
</I>&gt;<i> implementation a bit, I was wondering if anyone had a good idea for how to
</I>&gt;<i> do it in the meantime, or had already gone down this path and could give a
</I>&gt;<i> tip?  The best idea I've had so far is to bind my interfaces to EasySoap++
</I>&gt;<i> in C++ (I've had good success with EasySoap++ in the past for C++ projects)
</I>&gt;<i> then export them as C functions which I could P/Invoke with Mono via a C#
</I>&gt;<i> binding.  Maybe someone out there has already wrapped a C lib for SOAP for
</I>&gt;<i> this purpose, which would probably be a better strategy (Does such a lib
</I>&gt;<i> exist?  SOUP's SOAP seems dead and OpenSoap seems unusably complex).  Any
</I>&gt;<i> ideas welcome!  I'm determined to get my code running on Mono. :)
</I>
That is one option.  Another option would be to have your SOAP messages
manually crafted, and  send them using the simpler web classes.

Miguel
