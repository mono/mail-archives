Cool - I'll check out the CVS version then, the install stuff could be
interesting as well, as I'll be keen on building some form on windows
installer as well ( preferably all from linux ).

If it compiles fine, it should suffice for what we currently need ( with
it still running on a windows host ).  I'll take a look a the services
stuff in cvs, not sure if I'll be much use thou, so far I'm only a week or
two into really using C# :)

What sort of services framework do we want to provide to mono/linux?  We
were discussing this in the office this afternoon, possibly implement the
ServiceBase class to provide base functionality that'll fork and daemonize
itself, and handle ( pass over to the implementing subclass ) the
appropriate start/stop/restart messages ( kill -HUP or process.exe
--restart style ).
