<PRE>&gt;<i>From: <A HREF="mailto:leroy.dissinger@kodak.com">leroy.dissinger@kodak.com</A>
</I>
&gt;<i>I've read the FAQ page and didn't see much on the System.Messaging
</I>&gt;<i>classes, namely MSMQ and Transactions for MSMQ, etc.   What is the target
</I>&gt;<i>time for implementation of these classes.
</I>
I'm working on these technologies, but any volunteers would speed it up a 
lot.

There's no scheduled date so far, as it is somewhat orbiting mono like 
saturn around the sun: It's huge, but for cosmicly-near-sighted earthlings, 
it's too afar to have dayly relevance.

&gt;<i>I realize that MSMQ isn't really a core .NET service, it's a COM+ 
</I>&gt;<i>component.   A MSMQ lookalike could be written for Linux, but don't know if 
</I>&gt;<i>this is planned.
</I>
The MSMQ-lookalike is my other project: MonoQLE (at sourceforge).

A dearth of volunteers also happen there, as too many people think 
corporations are happy to pay tens of thousands for licenses for MQ products 
(think three-letters). To be fair MSMQ comes 'free' with Windows Server, but 
you become a prisoner of their software-locking scheme.

Also, if you go Java, JBoss has an embedded JMS offering. That makes MQ 
services have a good open-source implementation. But again Mono exists for 
those that want an alternative to Java.

Just an EA's activist digression:

I think that Mono is targetting mainly the Desktop Application developers 
and the Web Application developers. No criticism here, just expressing 
reality as I see it.

The Enterprise Application architect/developer, that have to factor 
scalability issues, among others, into their architecture, obviously depend 
on Desktop/Web technologies but also need a lot of other things, like 
Transactions/Messaging, to make applications scale to thousands of 
concurrent users in a manageable and cost-effective way.

I'm trying to work on filling this gap in Mono. It's just that I'm feeling a 
bit lonely here. Are there any other EA archs/devs around here?

End of digression...
