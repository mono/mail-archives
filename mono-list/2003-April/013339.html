<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Sure that is one way of doing things, but my proposal is to have a single 
</I>&gt;<i> daemon (I'm calling it 'monod') starting/tracking/managing all mono 
</I>&gt;<i> services. Somewhat similar to services.exe in Win2000, that manages 
</I>&gt;<i> services, each one started in a svchost.exe process.
</I>
I like this plan myself.

&gt;<i> The monod daemon would be started in the SysV style. But each service would 
</I>&gt;<i> be started on a dedicated process created by monod (no need to fork itself).
</I>
Yes, like this idea as well.  But I would make monod auto-launched when
some of the services api request the process to be started as well.  So
it is transparent to the user.

To keep monod small, I would write this in C myself, and have a trivial
RPC mechanism to communicate with it.  Since most people wont have Mono
daemons, I would not want to have the Mono runtime running all the time
to fulfill one or two requests that might barely happen.

&gt;<i> - A GUI for starting/stopping services is easier to construct by talking 
</I>&gt;<i> directly to monod than having to read/interpret scattered files (etc/conf, 
</I>&gt;<i> PIDs, etc...)
</I>
Provided you have an RPC mechanism to monod, there is a lot of
flexibility here.

Miguel
