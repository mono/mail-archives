<PRE>Hi,

I downloaded from CVS last night the source to mcs, mono and gtk# (as
per the instructions on the website).

Following the readme file, I compiled mono. However, it looks like most
of the dlls required (which should be in mcs) aren't there. Further
digging found this to be the case.

I've downloaded the tar ball which the other readme file says, copied
this to /usr/local and then compiled mcs (as per the instructions).

I have 2 questions about this process.

1. Shouldn't the sources for the dlls be part of the cvs download
2. Why are the files in the tar ball all terminated with the .exe
extension?

TTFN

Paul

P.S. Mono is marvellous - keep up the good work :-)

Tired of bloated software which gobbles up your system resources?
Bored of hearing your harddrive being thrashed by inefficient code?
Feel like tearing your hair out when you see a blue screen of death?
Then why not come over from the darkside, and become one of the ever
increasing number of people using Linux - it's free, it's open,
it's easier to use than Windows and more reliable as well.
