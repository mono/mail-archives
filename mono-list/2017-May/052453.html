Subject: Congrats Dude!

Mobile, so can't reference your post as i write.

Carrying with one  in that chamber is common and preferred. Having  to rack a  weapon before use can lose tactical advantage.

I don't know what  weapon she had, so can't  comment on  specifics.  That said, not every weapon is a good carry  weapon. Further more, weapons should be picked to match specific needs and  skill set.

Many carry weapons do not have active safeties. Meaning, no switch to  switch. This is  to ensure the weapon can be used  in high stress  situations without  worry of forgetting or fumbling to turn off. Many  (most/all) carry weapons  do  have  multiple passive safeties which prevent the weapon  from discharging  when dropped and or require  a finger to physically be on the trigger. Meaning it can only be  fired  intentionally.


In general, women  carrying  in their purse is  heavily frowned upon. Honestly, in  my  opinion, its stupid. Its a sign  they perhaps should  not be carrying in the  first place. A weapon  in the  purse  encourages the women to lose  control of her weapon in even the best of circumstances. Its reckless and  dangerous.  As  is  exactly what happened here. Her decision to  carry in her purse killed her. It was a bad decision. Secondly, carrying in a  purse encourages  the  weapon to be stolen, thereby  leaving the women  entirely unarmed, and  worse,  her assailant is now  armed. At best she  has fed the gun  black market. Women should never carry in their purse,  save  only  in very uncommon situations.

That said, many state laws  basically force women  to decide between  their ability to protect  themselves and going out. As some  laws  frequently force  these poor decisions under the guise its a bad idea but better  than nothing. That's why  in part open carry is  constitutionally protected and illegal in all states that prevent it. People  should never  be forced to surrender their right to self protection unless  it steps on someone else's constitutional rights.

While  this is most definitely a sad situation, the real  problem is  that many  thousands of guns are used annually to protect  people and  save lives yet this accident is held high by  trashy media  and unintelligent  leftists. If the left actually cared,  they would  be campaigning for women to not carry  in their purse and to once again encourage gun education in our schools.
