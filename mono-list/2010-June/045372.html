I know that to set a window to fullscreen in X requires
_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN.  A quick grep of the Mono and libgdiplus source
did not turn this up so I assume there is no managed call I can make to set
an X window to fullscreen.

GTK+ does it with a call to GDK that uses _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN through
XLib.  So there are a few levels of C code underneath GTK#.

I am really interested in doing it from System.Drawing or Windows Forms.

The normal ways of using the full screen on Windows do not seem to work on
X.  For example, even if I set the window size to the full screen size and
the location of the window to 0,0 window managers like Metacity (GNOME) will
meddle to keep the panels on top.  The way to stop this with native X apps
is to use _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN as above.

I know I can call XLib directly but the C calls require handles to the
display and the window.  How would I get a hold of these from Mono if I
wanted to call XLib myself?

Do I have to modify libgdiplus or write my own C glue just to make a window
use the whole screen?  I certainly hope not.  It would not be cross-platform
for starters.
