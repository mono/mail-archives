<PRE>Hi,

I have a regular mono process (not a daemon) that I have set up to start
with the system boot, runs as root and does stuff in the background. The
problem I see, and have verified during several months is that once the
process accrues 1000 minutes of cpu time (as reported by top), the process
gets terminated/killed at the next hour boundary.

Is there something in mono that could cause this?, or should I look
somewhere else?

The mono process is running in a (Virtuozzo) VPS with CentOS 5, and 
WHM/cPanel server... I have searched for info on Virtuozzo/cPanel that could 
explain this, but have found nothing...

If anybody has any idea about the cause for this, I would be very grateful..

Best regards,

Oriol

</PRE>
