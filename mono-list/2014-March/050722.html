<PRE>I would like to warn you that learning some of the Gtk# API was a challenge 
for me at first because I was stuck in the Microsoft way of doing things. 
Once I learned how to use Gtk# effectively I loved it but not at first. 

For example the Gtk.TreeView does not work anything like WinForms.GridView 
and everyone I know who tried to make the Gtk.TreeView work like a 
WinForms.GridView didn't succeed but preferred the Gtk.TreeView + 
Gtk.TreeStore methods in the end.

In the long run it feels to me like Gtk# is easier to use MVC techniques on 
than WinForms so if you have the time to learn the Gtk# API I recommend it 
very highly for cross platform development.

This is just the opinion of a humble developer nothing more.

Hey, 
 Mono has an implementaiton of Windows.Forms, but it is both old, 
unmaintainted and known to have some bugs. 
 Some people have been able to use it effectively, but we do not currently 
have an active maintainer, so we encourage developers to pick something 
like Gtk# instead.

doing command-line and server-side Unix, Python, and JavaScript stuff 
mostly.]

I've been asked to fix, update and make portable an app build around 
Microsoft.Reporting.WinForms. From searching I see a bunch of old posts 
saying that Mono doesn't support WinForms but nothing very recent. I don't 
really know much about it so my basic question is if there is an easy fix 
(add the needed assembly somewhere) and if not what is the recommended way 
to handle porting?

I had nothing to do with writing this app and it's fairly large, complex, 
and seems poorly written but as much as I'd like to do a total remit it's 
probably not the best strategy at the moment.
