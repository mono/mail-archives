<PRE>&gt;<i> From: Peter Hultqvist [mailto:<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-list">phq at silentorbit.com</A>]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have used mkbundle together with &quot;setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep'
</I>&gt;<i> /path/to/my-bin&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> That way I get a binary which can listen to privileged ports without
</I>&gt;<i> running as root.
</I>
So - First of all, the cap_net_bind_service permission has to be applied to the file ...  But it's the &quot;mono&quot; executable that needs it, right?  I actually tried applying that permission to both the mono executable and the exe file, but even so, I still got access denied.  Not sure why.  I checked my kernel version, and I think it should have worked ...

I would consider it to be a bad thing, if the permission needs to be applied to the mono executable.  And based on my understanding, that's what I think is actually required.


&gt;<i> Your method is probably better since it prevents further use of
</I>&gt;<i> privileged ports.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also you could possible use iptables to redirect to a higher port number.
</I>
Yeah, I thought of that.  (Meaning, found it on google and thought about it.)  Things *could* end up this way if other plans don't go well.
