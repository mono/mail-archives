Hi Dave,

I am sorry to differ from your reasoning and thanks for logging this as a
bug for me.

Are you suggesting that System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer in Mono can
serialize read only property with a non-public setter? I guess, it is most
unfortunate that ECMA does not prescribe the behaviour of
System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer.

So what is Mono's position on treatment of class with non-public setter and
can you point me to the definition/specification? 

If departure like this is prevalent (indeed I have long MS .Net background)
and is up to mono developer's wishes then may I respectfully suggest to mono
project to change its claim on their project web page
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page">http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page</A> from the current one which states
that:
&quot;Cross platform, open source .Net development framework&quot;

Since cross platform is an important issue to me, perhaps Mono is not the
right tools. 

MarL
