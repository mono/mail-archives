<PRE>The simple fact of the matter is that xamarin does not care about
desktop linux, Miguel is on record as saying the desktop linux has
failed. Xamarin is a commercial company that makes no money from
desktop linux and thus has not incentive to make it easy for distro
packagers. Take a look a monologue, it is dominated by commercial
companies using mono, there are almost no posts from people using mono
for opensource, requests to be included in monologue from prominent
people involved in the opensource side of mono (Like Ian Norton) have
been ignored. Xamarin has no interest in opensource mono at all.
MonoDevelop 4.0 doesn't actually exists, only Xamarin Studio 4.0 which
is not open source and does not not support linux. This is not a
complaint, its just a commercial reality.

Despite this mono is still opensource and I am seeing a lot of
activity and interest in opensource mono from outside Xamarin. Ian and
I have started a alternative blog aggregation for people involved in
opensource mono here: <A HREF="http://planeteria.org/mono/">http://planeteria.org/mono/</A> If you are involved
in opensource mono or use mono to create opensource products and have
a blog please contact Ian or myself and we will add you.

I think in the long term the continuance of opensource mono will
require the creation of a mono foundation, there has been some talk of
that on this mailing list before but nothing has come of it. It is
clear however that we can not reply on Xamarin to act in the best
interest of desktop linux, and why should they?

</I>&gt;<i> I'm really disappointed at the moment with the information policy of Xamarin
