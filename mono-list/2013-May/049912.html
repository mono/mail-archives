<PRE>Hi,

I'm the mono maintainer of Arch Linux and I would really like to package 
and push the mono framework and monodevelop to the next stable release 
out there. But it is totally not possible to find out what the latest 
stable release of mono (and subpackages) and monodevelop is on the servers.

Since ages there is mono 3.x out there but it's stated as beta on the 
official download page. Monodevelop latest release is 4.0.8, but it 
isn't possible to compile it because it's complaining about missing 
dependency. I would really like to support the mono developers and 
provide the latest packages to our community, but with all the splitted 
sources and packages and absolutely no information about a release, it 
is not possible to maintain this.

This is a call to the mono developers / Xamarin to change this and to 
provide us packagers with the information we need to package mono and 
the related packages for our distribution.

I don't want to click anymore through github repositories and outdated 
webpages on mono-project.com to get the information I need.

A webpage with information about the latest (stable) packages and links 
to the source tarballs would be perfect! In the past this was done, but 
since Xamarin has taken the development this page doesn't exists anymore.

I'm really disappointed at the moment with the information policy of 
Xamarin and the packager for Linux distribution.

I really hope that there will be an answer for this call.

Cheers
  - Daniel
