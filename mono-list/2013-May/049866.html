<PRE>Hi,

What does it mean? Is GTK# going to be supported in future? I am
afraid it will die and get replaced by xwt or something like that :(
(if that is a case, I hope that mono developers make it really easy to
convert existing gtk# application to xwt, by calling the controls same
and properties as well, as rewriting the whole GUI of huge app is a
lot of pointless work)

Also, you mentioned that monodevelop is using gtk#3 is there any guide
how to install and use it? I suppose that only way is to download the
sources and build it myself, which may not work in windows as it would
require the gtk3 libraries as well.

Thank you
