<PRE>Hi Edward,

Those 4 points I mentioned are really about comparing Java platforms to
Windows.

&gt;<i> Really, none of that is true.  The blanket statement &quot;java is more secure
</I>&gt;<i> than windows&quot; is very arguable,
</I>&gt;<i> but not worth arguing.
</I>
I am not talking about application security here. Both Java and .NET are
vulnerable to things like SQL injection, disassemblers, plain text
configuration files, etc. My point is that Unix-like servers are
architecturally more secure than Windows servers. For example, Unix-like
servers address the issue of privilege separation at the architectural
level:

&gt;<i>Point #2 also, very arguable, not worth arguing.
</I>
Solaris, for example, has demonstrated linear scalability to 64 processors
in a system, has databases larger than 5 terabytes, and lets thousands of
users connect. Windows does not come close. Simply google the web and you
will also find that Unix-like servers provide higher availability than
Windows.

&gt;<i>Point #4:  &quot;Java is cheaper than windows because solaris is free for
</I>development&quot; is a really weird
&gt;<i>statement
</I>
Well, at least you won't have to bear the costs during development ;) Also,
there are tons of free Linux alternatives unlike Windows

&gt;<i>Use ubuntu server.  That'll do it for you. 
</I>Thank you for the suggestion. I will look into it.
