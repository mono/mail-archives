<PRE>Hi Dave,

Thanks for your suggestion and the links to download the parallel
installation. It is fanatastic and why Linux does not do this as modi
operandi for other software like GnuCash?

I followed the instructions provided by the link and managed to install
pmono and the accompanied MonoDevelop (version 4.0.4). The mono runtime is
3.0.11.

With MD 3.0.3.2 (I installed this from BadgerPorts PPA), the mono runtime is
2.10.8.1.

I am running all these in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

I fired up the MD (4.0.4) using the 
pmono monodevelop &lt;My Mono Solution&gt;

I ran the same unit tests as prepared in VS2010 in .Net 4.0. Sadly, the
XmlSerializer failed the test in which it did not generate the
InvalidOperationException and then same kind of complain that came from
.Net's sgen when dealing with a class with non-public property setter. Does
mono use sgen? But at least it should throw the exception when dealing with
a class with non-public property setter.

That means both mono 2.10.8.1 and the shiny 3.0.11 both fails the tests.
This kind of difference in runtime behaviour does not instil much confidence
in Mono to implement cross-platform solution. I wonder how many others in
this category?

Mono's XmlSerializer seems to be blissfully ignoring the accessibility of
the property setter treating it like public. Of course with reflection, one
would have no trouble to execute that setter.

So looks like back to the drawing board.

MarL.
