<PRE>Hi,

Mono is great and so much work has been put into it since its inception some
10 years ago.

The fact is applications today are built on the server-side whether they are
web based or mobile apps based. When it comes to server technologies,
enterprises refer Java.

The primary reason Java is popular with the enterprise is its supported
server platforms (Given similiar hardware) like Solaris and RHEL. When
compared to Windows servers,

1) More secure
2) Better performance, scalability and reliability. Windows servers are
clunky.
3) Works well with Oracle, the large enterprise's database of choice
4) Cheaper (Solaris is free for development)

It is great Mono brings Solaris to the table but Solaris is not free for
production use.

OpenSuse is a great client but I need something for the server.

It would be great if Mono also gets support for CentOS.
