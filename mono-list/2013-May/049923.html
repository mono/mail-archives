That means both mono 2.10.8.1 and the shiny 3.0.11 both fails the tests.

 As for the expected InvalidOperationException, I think this is one area
that the mono maintainers seem to take liberty to deviate from MS .NET
behavior. I've logged a few bugs like this in the past where mono does not
throw an exception but MS does and they refuse to fix these because it is
likely to break people's working code. IMHO it would be better to have
compatibility as I think most people expect this when coming from the
Windows world.  I think most .NET developers that start using mono probably
have experience working in Windows and would the same exceptions raised on
either platform...devs want to be able to take their code to any OS,
including Windows.
