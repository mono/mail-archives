<PRE>&gt;<i> work). In the
</I>&gt;<i> second case, your program need not be GPL but I am
</I>&gt;<i> not sure if 
</I>&gt;<i> this allows a user to invoke the GPLed Interface
</I>&gt;<i> implementation.
</I>
This is why stallman is against allowing the gcc to be
used as shared object. To prevent that type of usage.

Point being that the implementor of this &quot;GPLed
Interface implementation.&quot; would be in violation to
release GPLed code wrapped in a different licence.

Also if you instanciated that object for usage a
non-gpled code you would also be in trouble.... 

Which brings me back to my original question, what
does linking mean in C#? 

What type of protection does the mono c# compiler have
at all from that type of usage?

Bye the way, 
You can avoid linking by using an XML or Binary file
alltogether instead of linking. 

That is exactly what is being done by the swagkit
people, and cpp_xml.

XMLRPC, SOAP and RPC are all not covered by the GPL
under linking directly.

The question is of derived works, if you have to
distribute the GCC as a dll to use your non-free
program and it would not work without it, it might be
considered a derived work... It is a grey area.
