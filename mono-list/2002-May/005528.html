<PRE>Brad,

&gt;<i> XP Home does not ship with the web server. XP Professional does, but it's

&gt;<i> couple &quot;simple&quot; web servers that can host ASP.net without needing IIS:

Thanks for the pointers.  I tried to run the first one. Unfortunately,
neither the precompiled exe runs nor I am able to recompile the code with
mono.  The precompiled exe will serve the static start page but fail with a
NullReferenceException processing the aspx.  I haven't investigated further.

The mono team however might be interested in the compiler errors

The project consists of two sub projects you have to compile separately.
The &quot;NetProxy&quot; subproject requires to add System.Web.  However, this seems
to require adding also System.Drawing but it cannot find it:

 $ mcs.bat -r System.Web -r System.Drawing *.cs

 (process:2908): ** WARNING **: Could not find assembly System.Drawing
c:/mono-0.10/install/lib\System.Drawing.dll

Interestingly, a message box with the title &quot;Fehler&quot; (error in German) opens
which says

 (process:772):**ERROR**: file object.c: line 127 (mono_class_vtable):
assertion failed: (class) aborting...

Even more interestingly, the message box does not always occur.  If I rerun
the compiler, it's about every third or forth time - a GC problem?

Well... So I tried to recompile at least the other subproject.  A few
minutes ago, it gave me a NullReferenceException in the compiler, but now, I
only get the &quot;Fehler&quot;-Message box - do I have to reboot my system because of
a faulty DLL?

This project should be a good test case for mcs and the mono library.


bye
