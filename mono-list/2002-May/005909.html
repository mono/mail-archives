<PRE>Yes, but the GPL is not any more &quot;viral&quot; than a license from Microsoft
which limits your ability to use their code (e.g. their shared source
license).

This is why the GPL is almost never used for libraries.  Under Linux,
libraries are usually LGPL or X11.  That way linking is allowed.

Indeed, the FSF recommends that you *not* use the GPL for libraries unless
you are writing a library that has unique functionality, and you want to
give an advantage to free software (that's from their website).


I can't think of a single library that has this GPL problem you describe.

Also, even if you do really breach the GPL (say that you copy GPL code) ,
your code isn't GPL'd automatically.  No one can do that.  Rather, there
is a conflict that has to be resolved.  One solution is to simply remove
the GPL code (yes, in the case of linking the issue is more difficult, but
that's precisely why people DON'T release libraries under the GPL).

Daniel.
