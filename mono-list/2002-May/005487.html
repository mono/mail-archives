Thanks! I guess the windows people will welcome this addition.

&gt;<i> The footprint of the msvc build is small (a subdirectory from in the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;mono&quot; directory that contains all the msvc specific libs, includes,
</I>&gt;<i> projects, and bin directory).   The only changes to the main project
</I>&gt;<i> path are a variety of minor source code changes that are necessary for
</I>&gt;<i> cross platform compatibility.
</I>
Excellent!

&gt;<i> I will have a more complete list when I can grab the diffs off my
</I>&gt;<i> computer and send them.
</I>
Thanks. We're waiting for them: we'll be able to offer more comments
when we see the actual diffs (please use the -u option of diff).

&gt;<i> ISSUES:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can we come up with a solid way of handling multiple compiler versions.   Perhaps the following:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Macros: __GCC__, __MSVC__, __CODEWARRIOR__, __PRODG__, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Dirs: mono/msvc - MSVC specific projects libs, includes, bin, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>         mono/codewarrior - Codewarrior specific projects libs, includes, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>         etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Possibly a &quot;compiler.h&quot; file..?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Currently I am using _MSC_VER, placing some extra bits in the msvc version of the config.h file, and #ifdef _MSC_VER including msvc specific include files where they are needed.
</I>
Yes, I think that's fine. As a general rule we'd like to keep .c files
free from #ifdefs if possible, but having them in an header file is fine.

&gt;<i> We have an application that needs to be both cross platform, but who's
</I>&gt;<i> primary dev environment and tools are based in Windows.  This means that
</I>&gt;<i> we need the same version of .NET running on all platforms (i.e. mono,
</I>&gt;<i> because it's cross platform), but we do primary tools development in
</I>&gt;<i> Windows, for Windows, in Visual Studio with MFC, etc.   Obviously this
</I>&gt;<i> requires both that we have a working VS library for the mono jit and
</I>&gt;<i> interpreter for the primary app, as well as CodeWarrior, ProDG, and
</I>&gt;<i> GNU compatible versions of mono for the other platforms (i.e. GameCube,
</I>&gt;<i> PS2, XBox).
</I>
I sense it will be fun to see mono support all that platforms:-)

&gt;<i> We still need a C# to C/C++ compiler for final highly optimized release
</I>&gt;<i> builds of all static assemblies, but that will have to come a bit later
</I>&gt;<i> I think.
</I>
We have plans for an ahead of time compiler, but that is still a few
months off...
