</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Secondly, the public interface of a class tends to be less volatile.  It
</I>&gt;<i> changes less often, in other words.  This makes it easier to keep your tests

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, non-public methods will be used by the public ones eventually, and
</I>&gt;<i> therefore will be tested, albeit somewhat indirectly. Those that are never
</I>&gt;<i> reached by a public access point are unneeded anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> See <A HREF="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UnitTests">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UnitTests</A> for more info (and debate).  Search for

Hi

It's good to finally make a post, after lurking for so long. :-)

Are you asking about classes which are part of the .NET framework, or
are you asking about classes which are internal to Mono? In both cases
all non-private members form part of a class' interface and should
probably be tested.

However, I think it is more important to test protected members of the
.NET framework. When Mono is released, developers are going to be using
this code. It may seem a bit strange writing subclasses in tests. But
consider that this is exactly how developers will be using the Mono
code. They are going to be writing subclasses, so it makes sense to do
the same in testing.

The point about testing private methods is a good one. It is a tricky
issue when you want to write a test for a complicated piece of private
code. In the past I've found that this is an indicator that the code in
the private should be made simpler, possibly in more than one class
(that's option 2 on the page you link to). Each of these classes can
then be tested through its non-private methods. Of course, you may not
have this option with private methods in classes that form part of a
public API.

Rich Dougherty
