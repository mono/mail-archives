<PRE>Hiya,

&gt;<i> &gt; Is anybody working on &quot;System.Runtime.Remoting.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Channels.Tcp.*Channel&quot; and friends?   
</I>
&gt;<i> The remoting framework is in place, but the actual channel does not
</I>&gt;<i> exist.  Ingo Rammer said he was interested in contributing 
</I>&gt;<i> such a thing.
</I>
Exactly. This offer is still valid ;). Even though I read quite a number of
sources of Remoting while writing my book, I did in fact not work my way
through TcpChannel. What I'd need someone of you to do is to write a small
documentation of the binary transfer format of the TcpChannel (i.e. how are
the header encoded and how is the stream transferred) by reading the Rotor
sources.

As soon as I get this information, I'll start hacking it ;)

Alternatively, I can opt to write the documentation but in this case, I'm
not going to be a great help for you as I won't be able to contribute too
much afterwards.
