<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; out of curiosity, has anyone else seen really bad performance in certain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; spots like menus in sharpdevelop on windows XP?  mine slows dramatically
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whenever i mouseover a menu and flashes a bit also, but my XP
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; installation is on top of vmware, so i can't tell if its sharpdevelop or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the vmware that's causing the performance problem.  I haven't noticed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problems like that anywhere else in xp, but i don't know that i have any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other real .Net apps installed either.  if anyone has any tips for me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they are much appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which menu style do you use.  I use sharpdevelop on a &quot;real&quot; XP and I
</I>didn't
&gt;<i> notice any slowdown or flashing when using the &quot;flat&quot; style.  I think, the
</I>&gt;<i> SD menus are selfmade (for whatever reason), so perhaps there drawing
</I>isn't
&gt;<i> as optimized as the drawing of real Windows menus and this is visible in
</I>&gt;<i> vmware.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The 3D style menus feel less snappy, sometimes the selecition bar doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> follow the mouse. They also look neither like XP nor VS.NET so I don't use
</I>&gt;<i> this style.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Well this is only the second true .net app i use on my computer ( 1ghz amd
512 mb ram and win xp pro ) and i also see no problems with the menus or
flashing and also i use the flat style, then ONLY thing i have noticed about
this and the other .net app i use are that they have very slow startup times
(  20+ seconds ) and i think this has to do with .net itself but not sure.
So i would GUESS that atleaste part of the preformance hit is from vmware
but dunno.
