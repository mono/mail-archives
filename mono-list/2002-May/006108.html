<PRE>Ok, you're right, Jikes actually does produce this type of code,
nevertheless, Javac does not. No argument about which compiler is used more often.

Anyway, a Bytecode to CIL-translator would probably want to start with easy
code and then works toward the more difficult stuff (and thus start with
javac-generated code or code that does not exhibit these problems).

Even then, the problem of resued local variables is a lot easier to solve
that you say. Just split the local variable after types. The Java Virtual
Machine Specification does not allow reading reference types as integers, so
astore_1
iload_1
is not allowed anyway. So a simple translation scheme might do something
like: Generate 1 new local variable for each old pair of (variable position,
variable type).

To answer your last statement:
My statement was not directly about mono, but rather about the project of
JB-CIL-Translation. And CIL is certainly &quot;near&quot; JB. As someone has already
pointed out, it is a superset of JB.

A JB-CIL-Translator is certainly interesting and I should like to take part
if I have enough time (that way I can learn something about CIL).

Try compiling the attatched code with Kopi or Jikes (which I have on my box)
and try disassembling it ... (with jdasm of course). See the istore_0 and
lstore_0 in the same function ?

Language specs should be followed , not ignored or taken for granted ....
otherwise you'll find yourself tearing your hair when that app you wrote 
doesn't port well..... and it's fun debugging bytecode.

&gt;<i> The real problem is that Java-Code normally uses the Java API ....
</I>
That is *after* the bytecode has been correctly parsed ... I guess 
this discussion isn't doing mono any good ...... nor is mono going 
anywhere near Java (Miguel himself said that he started Mono because
he didn't like Java's &quot;Give and Take&quot; combo)....
