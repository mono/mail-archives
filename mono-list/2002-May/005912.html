</I>Ah, true... But I'm not devoted to a single platform, and I like working 
on as many different types of projects at once. As a matter of fact, 
currently I'm writing software in 4 different languages: C++, C#, 
Javascript, and VB. (Different projects, but all concurrently., and of 
course the satellite languages XML, SQL and XSLT)

That being said, I *really* have fallen in love with VS.NET. I've never 
found anything that comes close. But, On different platforms I make do.

</I>Well, like I mentioned before, I use an Inspiron 8000 laptop, completly 
loaded. It was a hell of a lot more than $1000.

</I>Yeah, I've played with this as well, but VNC just doesn't cut it for the 
work I do.  I really don't like running multiple computers, as I'm 
constantly changing locations etc... My laptop supports multi-headed 
displays all on its own on XP, a feature which would be critical under 
Linux (Where ATI's drivers don't exactly shine )

I guess given the wide range of stuff I like to do, XP is still where 
I'll have to be, and using VMWare to bring Linux and BSD into the mix.

My ideal solution would be a Linux world, where it would run more of my 
native Windows Code. *sigh*
