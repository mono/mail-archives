<PRE>I would like to include those tests, please add them.

Attached is a test class mcs/class/corlib/Test/System/ExceptionTest.cs
which implements an NUnit test case for the exception described
previously. Also attached is the corresponding patch for
System/AllTests.cs. The ExceptionTest class only tests for this one
issue and so isn't a very good test of the Exception class as a whole. I
don't know if you want to include stub tests like this or not.

I forgot to include the small test program which demonstrates the
problem:

using System;

public class TryTest {
        public static void ThrowException() {
                throw new Exception();
        }

        public static void Main() {
                ThrowException();

                // If the following line is uncommented, mono will work
right.
                // Console.WriteLine(&quot;This shouldn't matter&quot;);

                try {
                        Console.WriteLine(&quot;In try block&quot;);
                } catch (Exception e) {
                        Console.WriteLine(&quot;------------------------&quot;);
                        Console.WriteLine(e);
                        Console.WriteLine(&quot;------------------------&quot;);
                }
        }
}

Before the patch, the Exception thrown in ThrowException() would be
caught by the catch block in Main().

Subject: [Mono-list] patch for mono/jit/exception.c


Running NUnitConsole_mono.exe in mono on Windows exposed the following
bug:

If an exception were throw by the instruction immediately preceding a
try block, the exception would be considered to be thrown inside the try
block.

A patch is attached which appears to solve the problem. The patch won't
work if arch_handle_exception() can be called with ctx-&gt;SC_EIP pointing
to the instruction which threw the exception. I think an exception can
only be thrown by a CALL (as far as managed code is concerned) so EIP
will always point to the instruction after the CALL. If this isn't the
case, a different fix will be needed.

I believe the same problem exists on Linux as well, but I haven't
tested. 

Cheers,
Linus
