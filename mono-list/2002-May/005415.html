<PRE>Thanks for the info Miguel!  Please direct me to any docs that would help
clarify my general questions.  I have some more questions below if anyone has
time to answer them.  

&gt;<i> My guess is that `mcs' there is not the native .NET executable, but the
</I>&gt;<i> mcs that is using the Mono runtime.  When running with the .NET runtime
</I>&gt;<i> you will get the assemblies from the .NET distribution, if you run with
</I>&gt;<i> our runtime you will get our assemblies.
</I>
the mcs i was using was (you're right) the mcs.bat file from the windows
binaries Johannes Roth made available last week.  

let me make sure i understand what you are saying.  is the native .NET
execuatble you are talking about monomcs.exe?  does monomcs.exe not use the
mono runtime?  also, i thought mono had implemented the
System.Runtime.Remoting.dll but I don't see it in the &quot;private GAC&quot; you
mentioned below.  when i use monomcs with the following options : 

monomcs --target ... -r System.Runtime.Remoting -r ChatServerLib.dll(local
monomcs compiled dll,) it seems to access the MS GAC...(the simple chat server
compiled.)  is that what is expected?

so, i've got a compiled chat server exe that seems to start up properly using
the MS runtime, but not the mono runtime(can't access
System.Runtime.Remoting.dll at runtime.)  so i'm not sure if that actually
means it's working properly referencing some monomcs dlls and some MS dlls ??

one other thing...monomcs produces IL that places the delegates outside the
namespace they were declared in, the opposite of what microsoft does.  (both
were declared inside the namespace in the code)

&gt;<i> You posted in the right place.  Thanks for your feedback as well.
</I>
Phew!  Thanks, Brian
