Speaking of ADO.Net, I started working on the
DataSet/DataRelation/Constraint stuff, but all I have so far is the
attached class, Tuple. Tuple takes an array of objects which must be
comparable (they must implement IComparable) and &quot;aggregates&quot; it into a
single comparable object. This allows relations and constraints to be
constructed on more than one column. More explictly it allows
multi-column data to be used as a key into an associative
order-preserving container. Its not designed to be used by client code.

I didn't write a hash function because I thought that the compiler would
provide one for me automatically. If this isn't the case let me know and
I will write one. If the compiler does provide one, some tests to
determine its fitness should probably be written because the uniformity
of its distribution will have a big impact on performance.

I started thinking about how I would implement the Relation and
Constraint classes, particularly how I would connect them to the
DataTable and DataTableCollection classes to respond to row insertion,
updates and deletes without modifying the class interface. I ended up
stopping that, however, because it was giving me a big headache.

I figured what I needed was a diagramtic reperesentation of the
relationships between the classes in the System.Data namespace that I
could have in front of me while I was programming, so I decided what I
would do is draw a uml diagram of the System.Data namespace. Then I
started thinking &quot;why not diagram the entire .Net Framework Class
library?&quot;, but then it also dawned on me that I didn't know anything
about uml. I went and read a book on uml. As of now I've started
constructing uml diagrams (package dependancy diagrams, class diagrams,
etc) for the .Net class library. I don't have enough done to warrant
providing them to the group, but when I do, I'll tar/gzip them up and
send them out (html, postscript and pdf versions)

I figured that having diagrams of the framework library would be a big
help. Let me know if you think this is a worthwhile effort or not.
