<PRE>From: &quot;Dick Porter&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:dick@ximian.com">dick@ximian.com</A>&gt;

&gt;<i> Theres a script on <A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/download">http://www.go-mono.com/download</A> that automates all
</I>&gt;<i> this for you.
</I>
Thank you!  I overlooked that script...  I probably thought that I didn't
have to read all the page and know what to do.  The script indeed seems to
work, however I don't see what it does differently than I...

It installs the precompiled stuff to .../install and not to /usr/local has I
tried but that shouldn't make a difference, should it?

Perhaps it's the aclocal stuff (where I have no clue that it does) or it's
because it adds the lib dir to the path (I didn't thought this is required)

Wouldn't it be a good idea (even if low-priority) idea to make it build
without some helper shell script?

BTW, the compiled mono.exe still doesn't run if I don't add the lib dir to
the PATH. I know, on Windows, DLLs must be either in the same dir as the EXE
or in the PATH.  However, cygwin being a Unix emulation should have this
&quot;feature&quot; but cygwin programs should search there libs in the cygwin lib
path.  Why does mono &quot;misbehave&quot; here?  Is there a good reason?


bye

PS: Installing glib for cygwin is horrible.  I've respect for the brave men
or women who compiled the binary distributions... :-)
