<PRE>From: &quot;Miguel de Icaza&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:miguel@ximian.com">miguel@ximian.com</A>&gt;

&gt;<i> Maybe we should talk at some point, but I would like to roll out a
</I>&gt;<i> little content management system for maintaining my home page (do not
</I>&gt;<i> look at it right now, it sucks), but I want a mechanism to maintain and
</I>&gt;<i> update this.
</I>
Well, I'm dreaming about something along these lines for my company, too.
But then, I ask myself whether I've a bad case of the NIH
(not-invented-here) syndrom, creating the 1025th CMS out there. So I haven't
started yet.

&gt;<i> ASP.NET seems like the natural choice, because you could have a
</I>&gt;<i> `BlogRender' component for example.
</I>
The component-based approach is intriguing, yes.  Somewhere I read, ASP.NET
is JSP done right.  I can't comment on this statement yet, however.

bye
