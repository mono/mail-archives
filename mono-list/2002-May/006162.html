<PRE>&gt;<i> I think it's more pratical to take mono as a Linux
</I>&gt;<i> Server Platform, then
</I>&gt;<i> try to expand it to desktop. I have heard several
</I>&gt;<i> companies that want to
</I>&gt;<i> use mono as its server side platform, and take
</I>&gt;<i> Windows .NET as client
</I>&gt;<i> side platform(for C/S application).

Along the required functionality that you mentioned,
performance is equally important, specifically the
runtime performance. A server app should have minimum
downtime, recover system resources after peak loads,
etc, etc. We need to consider this too. 

One very specific example of how important is
performance on .net apps is the ms.net Global Assembly
Cache (GAC) that is created on the Windows platform. 
Obviously this is giving a performance boost that I
haven't found how much is it, and I'm curious to know
all the reasons that push Microsoft to build it, one
question is what it could be the performance for a
server app without it?
