<PRE>Hey Scott,

We would be glad to have your help working on DataSet, et all.

In cvs, SqlDataAdapter can Fill() a DataRow within a DataTable within a
DataSet.  Currently, you can only read data from it though, but it's a
start.  There is still LOTS to be done to DataSet, DataTable,
DataRelation, etc...

1. and 2. Tim Coleman and Rodrigo Moya have been working heavily in the
DataSet area. Another area that has not been touched at all - the
XmlDataDocument - it is just a stub right now.  There is currently no
XML support System.Data right now.  

If you want to know where we are with the ADO.NET functionality in Mono,
see the page <A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/ado-net.html">http://www.go-mono.com/ado-net.html</A>

3. There are coding styles for Mono.  Take a look at mcs/class/README.

The first step in helping out is to get mono and mcs from cvs.  There is
an anoncvs server setup to do this.  For mono, it is easier to use the
build scripts to build mono, but the build scripts do not retrieve nor
build mcs nor the class libraries.  You will have to checkout mcs from
cvs and build after mono has been built.

4. Any Mono cvs committer would do.  You can email Rodrigo Moya
<A HREF="mailto:rodrigo@ximian.com">rodrigo@ximian.com</A>, Tim Coleman <A HREF="mailto:tim@timcoleman.com">tim@timcoleman.com</A>, Miguel de Icaza
<A HREF="mailto:miguel@ximian.com">miguel@ximian.com</A>, or me.

5. This is the best forum for these questions.

Hope this helps,
Daniel

Subject: [Mono-list] ADO.Net

I am interested in working on some of the framework classes for the mono
project, particularly the DataRelation, DataSet, and DataTable portions
of ado.net. I was wondering several things:

1) Is Any one else working on this?
2) Has any of this been done?
3) Are there are any particular coding or design standards that the
project is using?
4) If I were to write them, where would I send the code too?
5) Is this group the appropriate forum for opening up discussion on the
best (or not so best) ways to approach an implementation of these
classes?
