<PRE>Hi,

I agree. A nice summary of what *can* be done on Windows and Linux would
be very helpful.

&gt;<i> Basically an explanation of what you guys have and how to use it.  I'd be happy
</I>&gt;<i> to help someone who knew what they were doing put it together.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  I really like the idea of the project of the week...you could put together

</I>
I volunteer to set up such a web page. I invite everyone's input (I
looked through the items on Bugzilla, but most are too complex for this,
to my understanding) on several such small, self-contained projects.

Also, what do you think about a weekly mono newsletter? This can be used
to gain publicity and also to promote these micro-projects :-) I will be
able to do this as well.

Pavel.
