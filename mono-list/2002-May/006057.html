<PRE>hi!

i'm a java programmer, and just read about your 'Java to IL 
Compiler'-project. at one point it says, that java-bytecode is a subset of 
cil-bytecode. would it be hard to make the mono-jit a hybrid platform which 
runs both cil-bytecode and java classfiles (without prior java-bytecode to 
cil translation)? if you put so much energy into creating a fast JIT, why 
not use it for java as well?
... instead of migrating software from java to cil, rather melt the two 
technologies together (with some kind of bridge in between - i guess that 
class-libraries still have to stay separate)... maybe this would also 
reduce the 'cost' of creating language bindings to gtk and gnome for both 
languages (like gtk# / java-gnome)...

but i don't know if this makes sense from a technical point of view... ;-)
