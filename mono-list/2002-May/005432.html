Hi,

I have managed to create visual studio project that will compile and run =
Mono and Mint from visual C++ 7.0.  I've tested it with a few modules, =
and it seems to work.  I haven't run the full test suite on it yet =
though.

The footprint of the msvc build is small (a subdirectory from in the =
&quot;mono&quot; directory that contains all the msvc specific libs, includes, =
projects, and bin directory).   The only changes to the main project =
path are a variety of minor source code changes that are necessary for =
cross platform compatibility.

Roughly, here are the changes to the code base:

1. MSVC doesn't work well with the unix autoconf, automake system (at =
least it's a pain in the ass).  Created preconfigured config.h and =
glibconfig.h files in the msvc directory.
2. MSVC doesn't link with the glib, gc, etc. dll's that gcc cygwin uses. =
 Luckily these were compiled with mingw, so there's no nasty cygwin =
dependencies.  I used dumpbin to get the exports, converted them to .DEF =
files, and created MSVC import libs and .exp files with the lib.exe =
command.
3. MSVC has many more lint style warnings than GCC.  I turned off =
signed/unsigned mismatch, dangerous 64 bit pointer warnings, type =
conversion warnings, unused var warnings, etc.
4. MSVC doesn't have standard low level io calls like open(), close(), =
etc.  Add an &lt;msvcio.h&gt; file that creates macros to rename msvc io calls =
to normal unix calls.
5. MSVC doesn't allow an empty &quot;default:&quot; block in a case statement.  I =
added a break; statement to each empty default block.
6. MSVC doesn't have sys/time.h or unistd.h.
7. MSVC doesn't like the constant NAN and INF declarations (1.0/0.0 and =
0.0/1.0) in the floating point routines.  I remarked these out for now.
8. MSVC doesn't compile GCC asm inlines.  #ifdef in __asm {} MSVC =
inlines in message.c to do the things.
9. MSVC doesn't like the floating point comparison functions in hacks.h =
for Mint.  Replaced these with __forceinline functions.  Also MSVC's =
version of isnan() is _isnan().
10. References to some of the GNU winapi header files were incompatible =
with actual windows headers.  #ifdef'ed them to use straight &lt;windows.h&gt;
11. MSVC's windows.h file doesn't define SignalAndWaitForEvent() without =
the _WINNT_VER macro being defined.  Added that to the project.
12. The current build depends on having monoburg, nant, and the other =
tools from the cygwin gcc build having already generated their various =
files.  Since linux gcc is the primary dev platform and will remain the =
primary dev platform, simply grabbing a snapshot of these generated =
files whenever a new MSVC build is needed is okay I'm thinking.  MSVC's =
projects are more for MSVC lib or exe builds, and development of =
integrated MSVC mono apps, not for work on the core bits of mono itself.

I will have a more complete list when I can grab the diffs off my =
computer and send them.

ISSUES:

Can we come up with a solid way of handling multiple compiler versions.  =
 Perhaps the following:

Macros: __GCC__, __MSVC__, __CODEWARRIOR__, __PRODG__, etc.

Dirs: mono/msvc - MSVC specific projects libs, includes, bin, etc.
        mono/codewarrior - Codewarrior specific projects libs, includes, =
etc.
        etc.

Possibly a &quot;compiler.h&quot; file..?

Currently I am using _MSC_VER, placing some extra bits in the msvc =
version of the config.h file, and #ifdef _MSC_VER including msvc =
specific include files where they are needed.

Any comments?

Now to answer the question WHY...

We have an application that needs to be both cross platform, but who's =
primary dev environment and tools are based in Windows.  This means that =
we need the same version of .NET running on all platforms (i.e. mono, =
because it's cross platform), but we do primary tools development in =
Windows, for Windows, in Visual Studio with MFC, etc.   Obviously this =
requires both that we have a working VS library for the mono jit and =
interpreter for the primary app, as well as CodeWarrior, ProDG, and GNU =
compatible versions of mono for the other platforms (i.e. GameCube, PS2, =
XBox).

We still need a C# to C/C++ compiler for final highly optimized release =
builds of all static assemblies, but that will have to come a bit later =
I think.
