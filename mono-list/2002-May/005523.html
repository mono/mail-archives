<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Heh, funny you would say that.  The reason I have refused to update my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; web page content is because I want to make sure that the next version of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; my web page is &quot;powered&quot; by Mono (blog included ;-).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd open source my experiments, if that would be helpful.
</I>
It would ;-)

Maybe we should talk at some point, but I would like to roll out a
little content management system for maintaining my home page (do not
look at it right now, it sucks), but I want a mechanism to maintain and
update this.

ASP.NET seems like the natural choice, because you could have a
`BlogRender' component for example. 


&gt;<i> While I follow the progress of the Linux desktops and greately appreciate
</I>&gt;<i> it, I really like my XP and see no need to switch... right now.
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, IMHO Windows is still the best Java development platform.  Its
</I>&gt;<i> VM is the fastest and it's the only platform right now, which supports all
</I>&gt;<i> JDK 1.4 features (fullscreen mode for example)...
</I>
I had to try...

&gt;<i> Hm, I could perhaps wait for one month, as Johannes promissed, but six?  I
</I>&gt;<i> can't even start to experiment with ASP on my windows box because that would
</I>&gt;<i> require me to install an IIS.  And I don't want that piece of sh^Hoftware on
</I>&gt;<i> my computer.
</I>
Yes, I think a full implementation is still six months away.  There are
pieces here and there, and we are working on various areas of the
problem, but I would not like to deceive you.  

&gt;<i> Interesting :-)  A MUD server is another thing, I always wanted to create...
</I>&gt;<i> Did he ever finish that project?
</I>
Yes.  

Miguel
