I applied your patch.

When the other end disappears you'd get a SIGPIPE. MSG_NOSIGNAL makes
the lib just return the error in that case without raising the signal.
I think the best solution would be to just signal (SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN),
but it would be good to know if BSD has a different flag we can use.

&gt;<i> after shortcutting around the problem by simply replacing MSG_NOSIGNAL

I currently get a total of less than 30 warnings with a complete
rebuild, if you get a significant number of warnings, they probably are
in some system header or in the GLib headers (updating to the latest
GLib helps there). Of course, this is just a guess, without looking at
the actual warning messages...

&gt;<i> are there any publicly available precompiled mono libs/executables i
</I>&gt;<i> could try this stuff out with?
</I>
The packaged snapshots should have binaries for corlib.dll, mcs.exe etc.
Check: <A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/download.html.">http://www.go-mono.com/download.html.</A>
There are also precompiled test cases that you can download:
<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-tests.tar.gz">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-tests.tar.gz</A>
Most of them you should be able to compile yourself once you get
mcs.exe running.
