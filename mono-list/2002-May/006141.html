<PRE>I've been outta town for a while, or I would have caught and responded to
this earlier.  I solved this problem.  The short story is: the prepackaged
libgc (Garbage Collector) on baselabs, as well as every other prepackaged
libgc I tried (which was quite a few) failed miserably.  It was surprisingly
difficult to track down a source tarball (indeed I couldnt find a src.rpm at
all after looking for about an hour with all my googling skill) but when I
did track it down (off of some Debian page) I recompiled it (including
fixing a typo in the Makefile) and then rebuilt mono, and all was well.

Incidently, you can prove to yourself that it is in fact the garbage
collector by compiling mono without libgc installed, and it will work.
However without a garbage collector, things might get pretty hairy when
running anything other than trivial programs, so using it in that state is
probably contraindicated.

If anyone is an rpm expert, perhaps when they gets a minute they could
rebuild libgc and make an i386.rpm out of the new build, and pass it to
Christophe for baselabs inclusion.

Good luck and feel free to contact me if you have any further troubles.

Ian
