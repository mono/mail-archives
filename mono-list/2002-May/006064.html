With regards to #develop: as #D is a GUI app, it extensively uses Windows 
Forms. In addition to that dependency, we need quite a few classes from 
other namespaces too. Therefore, for #develop to run under Mono, the Mono 
FCL must implement the classes used by #D. (We have a few WIN32 
dependencies, but these can be removed/worked around)

The Mono support we have so far is limited to platform-specific line 
terminators. The support that's going to be added soon: a switch in C# 
projects where you can choose to compile with either csc.exe or mcs.exe 
(nice for testing a project/class library/sample against both compilers).

While I'm at it: we'd welcome input to our unit testing framework, #unit 
(should be portable to Mono with exception to the GUI). It is slightly 
different from NUnit: it can test protected class members, follows .NET 
paradigms (attributes instead of inheritacne) and most importantly, it can 
test multi-assembly projects. (We are working on a detailed tech note)
