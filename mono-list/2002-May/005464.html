<PRE>Hi Taylor,

I have done ppc port before few months. It's not updated for about two
months. I will be very happy if you plan to help with ppc port.

OK, I will prepare small page with links to technical documentation
about ppc. I hope to have it this evening.

As Miguel pointed out, mono c# compiler (mcs) is written in c# so it
should work. I haven't tried it yet, as last time when I updated ppc
port mcs wasn't self hosting on linux. So it probably need some work to
update it to current mono.

Other big task is jit/ppc support which is not started yet.

Cheers
Radek
