<PRE>I currently use Cygwin under XP Pro on my nearly identical Inspiron
8100.  I doubt that will change in the near future.  I develop under
Windows and test with Mono under Cygwin.  I have a desktop system that I
will be putting Linux back on this weekend, and my initial plan is to
have it dual boot to XP Pro.  I may move some of my development efforts
there.  I hope to eventually move all of my development efforts there,
but I doubt I will at the start.

I just need to figure out something that should be an FAQ but I can't
find anywhere, which is how to make a Linux box live on a Windows 2000
domain (I need domain security, DHCP client, etc.).

Subject: [Mono-list] [OT] Windows and Linux, development practices.

 

  I've got a couple of [offtopic] questions about the way development 
being done by the group here. I think that this group of people are some

of the most level-headed when it comes to working in multiple
environments.

I really want to run Linux as my desktop of choice. Unfortunantly I'm a 
software development consultant, and I'm somewhat forced at the moment 
to run such tools as VB6, MS C++6, and Visual Studio.NET, amongst other 
windows software (office, etc...) for my client.

Now, I have had limited success running some stuff under WINE, but I 
haven't taken the time to get *all* of my tools running.

I've got a Dell Inspiron 8000 Laptop with an ATI Rage Mobility video 
chipset in it, that lets me run dual-head under windows with an external

monitor as the second screen. Damn invaluable.

So, given that a large number/most of the tools for .NET are availible 
under Windows, I figure the people here would be best suited to 
answering these questions:

1. How *are* you developing Mono, with Windows? Linux? Two Computers? 
Cygwin?

2. Those working under Linux, what kind of effort does it take to run 
some of this stuff under linux (specifically the Windows Dev tools? Is 
VMWare tough enough to get the job done? For *everyday* work?

3. Dual Booting? Is that worth my time?

4. How about that dual-headed support for the ATI Rage Mobility? Has 
anyone done that?

5. What is the likelyhood I'll *ever* be able to get MS's VS.NET to run 
under Linux?  ( as far as I'm aware it is largely native code with a 
dollop of Managed code inside.)
