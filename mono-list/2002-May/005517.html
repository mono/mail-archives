<PRE>Hi Miguel!

From: &quot;Miguel de Icaza&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:miguel@ximian.com">miguel@ximian.com</A>&gt;

&gt;<i> Heh, funny you would say that.  The reason I have refused to update my
</I>&gt;<i> web page content is because I want to make sure that the next version of
</I>&gt;<i> my web page is &quot;powered&quot; by Mono (blog included ;-).
</I>
I'd open source my experiments, if that would be helpful.

&gt;<i> Good choice.  The next step is to replace a few of those XP machines
</I>&gt;<i> with a Linux desktop ;-)
</I>
While I follow the progress of the Linux desktops and greately appreciate
it, I really like my XP and see no need to switch... right now.
Furthermore, IMHO Windows is still the best Java development platform.  Its
VM is the fastest and it's the only platform right now, which supports all
JDK 1.4 features (fullscreen mode for example)...

&gt;<i> The good news is that we are working on ASP.NET support;  The bad news
</I>&gt;<i> is that you can not expect this to exist for at least another six
</I>&gt;<i> months.
</I>
Hm, I could perhaps wait for one month, as Johannes promissed, but six?  I
can't even start to experiment with ASP on my windows box because that would
require me to install an IIS.  And I don't want that piece of sh^Hoftware on
my computer.

&gt;<i> I have the impression that FileUpload is just an http post, which should
</I>&gt;<i> not be complicated at all.  I am sure you can use some of the class
</I>&gt;<i> libraries without ASP.NET
</I>
While file upload eventually uses HTTP POST, it's more difficult because it
doesn't use the normal URL-encoded format but a more complex MIME format -
multipart/form-data.  In my code, I'd of course want to simply access some
dictionary of key/value pairs where the value in that case would be a
FileUpload object with a byte[] propery containing the data and a name
property for the file name.

I was hoping to be able to use some of the System.Web, but the Microsoft
docu only talks about ASP and ever about CGI.

&gt;<i> &gt; probably very similar, but I know Servlet programming very well and a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compatible API would be a big plus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We do not have anything like that.  Something that many of us want to
</I>&gt;<i> see happening is to have a JVM-Bytecode to IL bytecode conversion
</I>&gt;<i> program (Gaurav has looked into this in the past), and then run existing
</I>&gt;<i> Java software on top of Mono.
</I>
As I want some project to learn C#, running Java on the mono VES wouldn't be
helpful in this context :-)

Otherwise, it shouldn't be that difficult to compile class files into .NET
assemblies.  I think, there's even already some C# code to parse class files
out there in the internet.

&gt;<i> Some pieces of XML are ready, some are not.  It would be great if you
</I>&gt;<i> start work on your wiki/blog tool, and as you move along, contribute to
</I>&gt;<i> the project in the areas that its missing functionality (btw, Alan Cox,
</I>&gt;<i> one of the main Linux developers started work on Linux because he needed
</I>&gt;<i> a system to run a Mud server.  He ended up developing and maintaining
</I>&gt;<i> the TCP/IP stack for the kernel ;-)
</I>
Interesting :-)  A MUD server is another thing, I always wanted to create...
Did he ever finish that project?

I'll see, what I can do.

&gt;<i> We have a *marvelous* implementation of the regular expressions package,
</I>&gt;<i> implemented by Dan Lewis.
</I>
Great.


bye
