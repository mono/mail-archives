<PRE>No, I had just copied another set of .build files that referenced the
System.dll as /r:../lib/System.dll rather than using /r:System.dll, so I
figured that was what I was supposed to be doing.  I just now followed
your suggestion, and of course it worked flawlessly.

Seems odd that I could've written 19 other tests without referencing
anything from System, but maybe I did.  Probably everything I referenced
was in mscorlib.  Will have to check on that.

Perhaps only that one test used anything from System.dll.

NickD will probably be able to advise you on the best way to set up your
test
suite. Is there a particular reason why you want to test Mono's M.VB.dll
together with Mono's System.dll on Windows, instead of using Microsoft's
System.dll?

Unless you are seeing a difference in behaviour running the tests under
the
full Mono runtime compared to under MS.NET, perhaps it would be best
just
linking against Mono's M.VB.dll to help isolate the problems the tests
look
for.

Dan.


eg:

only copy Mono's Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll into the test directory,
then:

csc /noconfig /r:.\Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll /r:System.dll test.cs
./test.exe

This should grab M.VB.dll from the current directory, and then picks up
corlib.dll and System.dll from the GAC.
