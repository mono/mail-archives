I am the primary author of _Thinking in C#_ and am very interested in
making sure that all the applicable (non-Windows Forms, etc.) code runs
under Mono. The book emphasizes a text editor and command-line approach
to learning the language, so hopefully there are not too many areas
where I've confused &quot;What's C#&quot; with &quot;What's Visual Studio.&quot; I'd
appreciate feedback on any such mistakes. Another thing I'd like to do
in the book is present a clear picture of the boundaries between what is
Microsoft's protected IP and what is open; as I understand it, this is
the ECMA spec. True? And is there anywhere a clear diagram of what
elements are within the spec and which outside? Is it the case that, for
instance with System.Runtime.Interopservices that some classes might be
inside the spec and some outside, or are the standards fairly well
delineated by namespace boundaries? 

Also, any feedback on what I say about the CLR in Chapter 2 would be
much appreciated. Again, what I'm shooting for is a) technical accuracy
and b) a clear distinction between what is in the specification and what
is incidental to Microsoft's implementation. 

Okay, back to the chapter on multithreading...

Cheers,
Larry
