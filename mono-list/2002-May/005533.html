<PRE>Subject: Re: [Mono-list] People distributing Mono for Windows.

As a new-to-mono developer, I have a couple comments on Pavel's statement about
what could be done to increase the adoption of mono among new developers:

1.  There is some documentation that would probably make things easier.  (the
binary packages made a huge difference!)  I personally, and thanks to Miguel I
was able to get everything working, would like to see a document describing the
difference running mono and mcs on linux and windows.  Ex, what is the mcs.bat
file included with the windows binary distribution versus the monomcs.exe. 
Which one uses mono and which one is the native .net exe?
Maybe it should point out some of the different scenarios that might be
possible ( csc compiled exe's running in the mono runtime, mcs compiler
referencing .net dlls, etc )  Also, if there are any tools available (like
Ildasm.exe, etc) for mono, or if they can be used for mcs compiled apps.  

Basically an explanation of what you guys have and how to use it.  I'd be happy
to help someone who knew what they were doing put it together.  

2.  I really like the idea of the project of the week...you could put together
projects that utilize new classes as they are put together...

Thanks, and if I wasn't clear on anything, please ask for clarification.

Most certainly so! A big thanks indeed.

Is there anything that can be done to make the barrier to new developers
lower? A nice idea is the project-of-the-week type exercise, something
really tedious but not deeply technically challengling, that other
projects have.

Pavel.
