<PRE>I looked into this a while back. I have to warn you I have no real-world
experience of messaging applications - this is just what I concluded after a
brief look on the web, so feel free to jump in and tell me I'm talking crap.

In short there appear to be no open wire protocols for messaging. Even JMS only
defines an API. MSMQ 3 has support for SOAP-based messages, but as with
previous MSMQ incarnations there are no specifications for the format.

At the moment the messaging guys seem to be quite happy with their proprietary
protocols, enjoying the benefits of locking people into their platform.

It would certainly be an interesting exercise to write a System.Messaging
client and server/router in C# for use with Mono, perhaps using JBossMQ as a
guide to implementation. But interoperability with Windows platforms would be a
pain, as it would require a bridge.
