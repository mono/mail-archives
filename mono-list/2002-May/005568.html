&gt;<i> As the creator of OpenWiki I wanted to port my ASP software
</I>
www.openwiki.org?  From the URL I'd have guessed that you're using PHP.

Thank you for the feature status report.  As I'm more interested in the way
than the solution, I'll probably start with a GCI solution, waiting for the
mono ASP support.

&gt;<i> [file upload]
</I>
&gt;<i> See the HttpRequest.Files property, too easy. ;-)
</I>
Well, from the sources it looks like this isn't implemented yet - as most of
the HTTP stuff.  So, it's not THAT easy...

&gt;<i> &gt; I think, I'd keep pages as XML files, removing the need for a database.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would reconsider that.
</I>
As I tried to explain, my decissions were mostly based on what is available
right now or in very near future, not what would be the best technology...


bye
