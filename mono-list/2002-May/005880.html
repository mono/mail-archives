&gt;<i>I currently use Cygwin under XP Pro on my nearly identical Inspiron

Hmmm.. The 8100 has an NVidia GPU right?.  I wonder if that supports dual-headedness?

Ooooh. Good Question.  I keep switching environments, and I haven't 
registered my laptop into my client's domain, so this isn't so much of 
an issue, but I would like to know about it too.

</I>&gt;<i>This question was very interesting to me, as I currently dual boot

</I>I've had *moderate* success with wine, but I haven' t tried any

I used to use VMWare lots, but I find it feels quite synthetic compared 
to the native os. It just feels funny.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>using SuSE 8.0 on a brand new machine, so I may get vmware to work and

</I>&gt;<i>at the moment it's pretty difficult to work in just Linux, as the

</I>&gt;<i>run SharpDevelop in there as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I was thinking about using VMWare under Linux to run windows, but rather 
than using the OS thru the VMWare window, I thought I might try using 
the Terminal Services client to connect to XP from Linux (Either the 
ActiveX control, running under something like Codeweavers, or the free 
implementation (/.*RDP.*/ ? ) of the TS Client.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I wouldn't bet on being able to run any .NET is Wine, but I think vmware
</I>&gt;<i>would be a practical solution, if expensive.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>No, I wouldn't either, but I've seen strange things from Wine Before... 
I'da bet big bucks they'd never get some of the MS software to run, but 
they did.

&gt;<i>I'm sorry, that's not really much help - I've just waffled about random
</I>&gt;<i>stuff. Oh well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Does anyone what source of Wine is the best these days? After the fork, 
it gets muddy.
