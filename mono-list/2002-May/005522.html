<PRE>&gt;<i> can't even start to experiment with ASP on my windows box because that
</I>would
&gt;<i> require me to install an IIS.  And I don't want that piece of sh^Hoftware
</I>on
&gt;<i> my computer.
</I>
I don't have or know xp, but unless ms has changed it's strategy I think you
already have it installed on your computer.  ;-)   Or else I expect you at
least have PWS installed, which is enough (and complete) to develop any ASP.

&gt;<i> While file upload eventually uses HTTP POST, it's more difficult because
</I>it
&gt;<i> doesn't use the normal URL-encoded format but a more complex MIME format -
</I>&gt;<i> multipart/form-data.  In my code, I'd of course want to simply access some
</I>&gt;<i> dictionary of key/value pairs where the value in that case would be a
</I>&gt;<i> FileUpload object with a byte[] propery containing the data and a name
</I>&gt;<i> property for the file name.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was hoping to be able to use some of the System.Web, but the Microsoft
</I>&gt;<i> docu only talks about ASP and ever about CGI.
</I>
As said in prev msg: it's the HttpRequest.Files property. Doesn't even come
that easy in Java. ;)



Greets,
Lawrence
