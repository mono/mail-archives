Hi Steven

Yes, Mono 2.10.8 runs without a hitch for us on 6.2. I believe that 6.1 
still had issues, but CentOS/RHEL 6.2 work fine with Mono. I honestly 
couldn't say what the issue is; 6.2 has glibc 2.12-1.47 while 6.0 has 
2.12-1.7, so it seems only the build number changed -- not sure if any 
actual pthread code in 6.2 changed from earlier versions.

While I obviously can't guarantee faultless operation, I can say that 
we've had zero spinlocks with 6.2, where I would spinlock on 6.0 and 6.1 
just building Mono itself (since it uses mcs to build the assemblies) 
nearly 100% of the time.

Greg
