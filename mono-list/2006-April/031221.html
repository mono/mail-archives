OK that's great :) Even after reading this thread, could you do a 'gdb
101'? This is so that when the admin site next fails I'm not fumbling
through pages of docs whilst people around me are panicing that
everything is broken :)

I'm using mono 1.1.14 on the admin site machine, with the &quot;handle
SIGXCPU SIG33 SIGPWR nostop noprint&quot; and &quot;mono_backtrace&quot; macro
in /root/.gdbinit. The admin site runs on x86_64 so I haven't included
define mono_stack since it's marked as only tested on x86.

The symptoms for when the admin site fails are that Apache returns
'Server Temporarily Unavailable' after a few moments for each aspx
request.

So, next time it happens, I'll fire up &quot;gdb --pid=12345&quot; and be
presented with the (gdb) prompt ... from here, what do I type to
provide the most useful information?

&gt;<i> One thing that might help (on private email if you have to) is to
</I>&gt;<i> describe what kind of things your application is doing: what database
</I>&gt;<i> provider, whether you can run pieces of the application from the
</I>&gt;<i> command line (no web version).
</I>
We're using Npgsql.dll - not the latest version I confess - in fact
we've been using the same dll for months - just stuck it in the 'bin'
directory along with all the other dll's we're using or have written as
part of our own application.

That said, no problems have been experienced with it on Windows :)

Running the admin site under xsp is an interesting idea, since I'm not
doing anything exotic with mod_rewrite (like I have to for the public
site), however I'd need to reboot the machine to UP mode to use heap
buddy, and I don't want to do that when the machine is far away :) Will
using XSP bring any other debugging benefits than mod_mono ?

Cheers,
Gavin.
