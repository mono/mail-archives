Sure thing.
 
&gt;<i> You mention that the application will go down within twenty minutes.  By

</I>
The latter. Apache is only occupying the typical 80MB per process.

&gt;<i> You mentioned that requests were being received, but they were not
</I>&gt;<i> getting a reply.  What was the size of Mono then?
</I>
It could be anything from 300M upwards - initially we only saw that
everything stopped working when Mono reached about 800M, so we threw
more memory into the machine, but it made no difference.
 
&gt;<i> This could be caused by a number of reasons: the requests might not be
</I>&gt;<i> completing;   You might be using some library that has a threadpool
</I>&gt;<i> leak;  You might be starving and deadlocking the threadpool internally.
</I>
&lt;nod&gt; All sounding very sensible...

We use SMP machines so from what I've read, Heap Buddy will be no help..

I have been reading <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Debugging">http://www.mono-project.com/Debugging</A> as a result
of your reply to Georgi Moskov who is having the same issue as us, but I
don't understand how this applies to mod_mono, since obviously we do not
run the website from the commandline :)

Do I wait for the site to grind to a halt, and then attach gdb? Do I
hook gdb in as soon as the mod-mono-server.exe process begins? What gdb
options do I need to deal with multi-threads? Finally, do I need to
recompile mono to include extra debug symbols?

Cheers,
Gavin.
