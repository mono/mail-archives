<PRE>I reported this exact issue to this list over a month ago.  It's not a
CentOS issue but I happen to use CentOS4 as well.  The problem is with
other Gnome desktop apps that use a current version of SQLite, which is
installed by Yum/up2date, etc.  The solution is NOT to force installation
of a package that will break your other applications !!  Someone said there
was a packaging bug in 1.1.13 which should have been fixed to allow Mono to
install in a neighborly fashion with other existing applications that use
SQLite.  I was hoping to see this in a later cut.  Can someone verify that
this has been fixed in the current 1.1.15?

I'm wondering why Mono depends on SQLite anyway.

Someone else suggested the &quot;Linux Installer&quot; to keep Mono completely
separate from other packages, but then someone commented that the installer
has its own set of problems.  I wouldn't mind working with the installer if
someone could document what the potential problems are that we might
encounter.
 
Thanks!

I was the same problem. I installed sqlite with force flag.

	Sqlite 3.2.2-1 provides libsqlite3.so.0, so that doesn't help
either.
	
	Any suggestions what I can do here?
