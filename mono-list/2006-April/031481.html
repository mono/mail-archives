Atsushi, please check your sent bin for this post you sent to the list and
the post you sent on april 24 to the thread titled &quot;CultureInfo to it-IT&quot;.
You did not CC the list in this one but you did on that one, and I received
a dupe on that one.  I get similar dupes when Miguel responds to posts
since apparently he uses Reply-All.

I've checked the Mailman list discussions, and this issue has been reported
on and off for several years.  Usually the problem is when a CC recipient
matches the name of someone in the list.  Mailman has a flag (set by
default to On) which avoids sending dupes with the same message-id to the
same recipient.  I'm thinking that for v2.1.5 which is being used here, a
new bug has crept in.  I am checking with the Mailman-users list about
this.

Thanks again.
Tony
