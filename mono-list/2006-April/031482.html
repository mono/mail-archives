<PRE>Hello,

Tony, as I wrote

 &gt; (Of course having To for the sender and Cc to the list is not
 &gt; the case you claimed above. But if you meant it, it is simply
 &gt; unacceptable as discussed before.)

Having personal email on To: and the mailing list on Cc: is not
what you claimed some of us do (you said that we put the mail
list address on both To and Cc). You will receive two messages
(which is not identical in message routing context but identical
in message body context) obviously because we usually (I believe
it is usual, according to my experience) do &quot;reply to all&quot;.
The reason why we usually reply to messages in that way is already
explained by others.

(This time I dare removed your address from To but it is not
practical to expect others to understand your favor in advance
and it is very difficult to keep your favor in my memory. I think
it is &quot;Do in Rome as the Romans do&quot; matter - Robert also explained
it in other words. I on the other hand usually don't do reply to
all in some of other mailings lists I post.)

Cheers,
Atsushi Eno

</I>&gt;<i> same recipient.  I'm thinking that for v2.1.5 which is being used here, a
