<PRE>I have written a small command line prog in mono that rescales a
directory of images using System.Drawing and System.Drawing.Imaging, and
it doesn't require an X server to be actually running.

Maybe certain classes/methods in the namespace do, but my code uses both
the Bitmap and Image classes and runs fine with no X server running.
There is however X installed on the machine, just not necessarily
running.

If you can't be a good example,
then you'll just have to be  a horrible warning
