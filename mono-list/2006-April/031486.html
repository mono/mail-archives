This is exactly the header that I was looking at.  Thank you very much.  I
completely agree that the TO recipient &quot;might&quot; receive two copies depending
on mailman and the recipient's MUA.  It seems the consistent pattern is
that I get two copies from the list whenever people here use the list
address in the CC field, even when I am not in the TO field.

Note to Atsushi: I do not expect people to change their behavior, I'm
trying to understand what software in these many tiers is either
duplicating mails or not removing dupes.

I have just one more question in this diagnostic: Is anyone here receiving
mail with MS Outlook 2003 and not getting dupes?  If this is the case then
my server is creating the dupes.  If no one else is using Outlook (as would
be expected with the bias of most OSS communities) then it's still possible
that mailman is generating dupes and other people's MUAs are filtering
them.

Note however, that I am on the mailman-users list, obviously run using
mailman, and I do not get dupes from them even when they CC the list.  This
is why I am so confused about why it's only this one list where this issue
is manifested.

I apologize to others who don't give a dang about my mail issues.  I've
been trying to ascertain if this was a general issue, bug in mailman, etc.
Without this discussion I have no other way to perform a diagnosis.  Thank
you for your indulgence.

Tony
