I agree that the Reply-to should be configured to the list address.
However I find it very handy getting a personal copy (&quot;reply all&quot;)
because sometimes there are hours of difference (in the past even days!)
between getting a list email and a direct email (with the direct one
being much quicker I should add).

Some new to the list have been impatient in sending their message up to
five times with no information added, just not having got a response to
their original message at that time.

Maybe you can be more specific about what emails you get twice? Have you
checked the status of the &quot;Avoid duplicate copies of messages&quot; option
for your subscription?
