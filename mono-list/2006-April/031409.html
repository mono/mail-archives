<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; I suppose my real concern is that if you want to use code to draw
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (e.g.) CAPTCHAs or other bitmaps as part of a process, rather than for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the purposes of drawing UI for the user, running an X server to do it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could seem like overkill on a server that would ordinarily not be

Not entirely true ; you can't BOOT the OS without the GUI but (these
days) it's quite feasible to manage a Windows server without touching
GUI widgets.

</I>
I heartily disagree. I'd hardly call the non-GUI uses of Linux
&quot;limited&quot;. My default interface to Linux is the shell, and aside from
one application (MythTV), I never leave the confines of the command
line.

I think your perceptions are being skewed by your background as a CAD
engineer here.

So, I agree, it's sensible re-use to be using the X drawing routines ;
I wouldn't advocate re-writing such a large body of code just for
kicks. I was just exploring the possibility that someone might want to
draw things without having a graphical desktop up (or even without
graphics hardware being present) - which is probably the case on a
server generating bitmaps.

This is a pretty hypothetical line of reasoning anyway ; I'm not in
serious need of a solution to this, and if I was, I'd probably be
inclined to compromise.

The next question would be - is it possible to use X drawing libraries
in a way that does not use a Display, or use some sort of Display that
does not actually need a real display device... an example I was able
to find was Xvnc or Xvfb (which are the recommended X servers for
webMathematica).

I tried using Xvfb ; I got the same results as I got using xwin.exe
(cygwin X server), the segfault stacktraced further up in the thread.
Bah.
