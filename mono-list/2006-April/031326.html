<PRE>I have a relatively large C library that I do not want to reproduce in C#. Its
core functionality (for better or worse) is based around reading/writing a very
specific XML format. XML is created using libxml2's xmlWriter and parsed via
libxml2's XmlReader like interface. My goal is to expose this functionality to
.NET via streams.

Essentially, I would like to be able to write XML to a .NET stream (say asp.net
response) as well as read XML (from an asp.net request) from unmanaged code.

Any suggestions on the best way to get this done would be greatly appreciated.
