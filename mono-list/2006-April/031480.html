It is technically difficult to agree with you. Can you exactly point
out which mails are sent to both To and Cc to the mailing lists?
If there are such ones, the evidence should lie in the message headers.
As far as I have ever recognized there is none as such. And IF there
are such people who tend to do that, the number I believe is
absolutely small.

(Of course having To for the sender and Cc to the list is not
the case you claimed above. But if you meant it, it is simply
unacceptable as discussed before.)

I'd rather think that either your mail client downloads or your
mail *server* sends the same messages twice. Note that there was
exactly no one who agrees to you that he or she is also receiving
duplicates when you posted the first message on this topic.
