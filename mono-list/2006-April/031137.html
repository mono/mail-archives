If you use the mono packages from your distribution, which is what I
suggested, there is no such issue. They are done so that people won't
have to build from sources and they deal with the dependencies exactly
to solve the issues you had. If you want to ignore my advice it's
possible you'll run into dependency issues, but it's your choice, of
course.
Note that packages can have bugs themseleves, of course, so make sure
you file bug reports about that.
The binary installer, IMHO, should be avaoided or used only for quick
checks and not for 'production' installs. If you're happy with it good
for you, but it doesn't mean that it is the solution to the dependency
issues (the binary installer brings its own share of issues, you just
might be unaware of the).

&gt;<i> I respectfully request that someone provide a clear set of documentation
</I>&gt;<i> that explains how to work around these issues : &quot;How to install Mono when
</I>&gt;<i> installed packages are more or less up to date than current Mono
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies&quot;. Existing documentation found on the net is seriously out of
</I>&gt;<i> date and no longer helpful.  I'm basically a Windows/.NET/C# guy with Linux
</I>&gt;<i> admin experience.  I'm not a Linux C developer and not yet familiar with
</I>&gt;<i> building packages from source or hacking software as sophisticated as Mono
</I>&gt;<i> to conform to a unique environment, but I'm willing to learn everything
</I>&gt;<i> required using Mono as a learning project.
</I>
Beginners in the Linux worls should always use the packages that come
with their distribution. This is the documentation people need and it
is up to date:) If your distribution doesn't have current mono packages,
complain with them or change distribution.
