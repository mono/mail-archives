Hi, I'm planning to start developing desktop applications on C# with MySQL
that can be run under Windows9x,2K,XP and under Linux too.
I've read about this Mono project, but downloads page says that it is only
for Windows 2000 or greater and I need something to run on a windows 98
machine.
I've also read about a project called dotGNU and its portable .NET, and at
this point I don't know what to use for my applications development.
An important thing is that I don't want to use anything from Microsoft to
develop and I don't want neither install nor depend on Microsoft's .NET
Framework
I have a couple of questions about Mono before starting to develop and just
to check if this is suitable for me. Be patient, I'm a newbie in this.

1. Is it possible to develop with Mono using a Windows 98 machine?
2. Is it possible to run Mono applications using a Windows 98 machine?
3. On a client machine, is it possible to install only the mono runtime
instead the whole package that includes the compiler?
4. I need to build reports. At this moment I don't know what to use to
generate reports. What can I use or what do you recommend for making
reports?

Just for the record, I've been programming in Java and using jasperreports
with iReport (report designer). I've been very happy with Java but I would
like to change to C# for many reasons.

Thanks for your help, I really appreciate it!

Regards
