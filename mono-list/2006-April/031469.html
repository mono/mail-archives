<PRE>Hello,

(IANAL)
IMO, that's not quite correct. Actually, if you produce and distribute
a derived work of a GPL-licensed product then you must make the source
code available *for whom you distributed said derived work*.

This means that you can take a piece of GPL'd code, modify it, and
then sell copies without giving away the source code, BUT as soon as
some of your customers request it, you are forced to give him/her the
complete source code. On the other hand, if someone else (who didn't
receive a copy from you) asks you for the modified code, you're
allowed to deny the request.

Fell free to correct me if I'm wrong.
