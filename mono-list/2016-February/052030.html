<PRE>Hello,

ThreadPools are available on .NET 2.0, just not the fancier TPL-based ones.

Perhaps you could consider replacing that bit of code with using the
ThreadPool?

&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We&#8217;re currently porting a Windows Forms Application to Mono, and have
</I>&gt;<i> generally had great success.  However, we have now hit a critical decision
</I>&gt;<i> point, and were hoping for some guidance on the best route forward.   If we
</I>&gt;<i> don&#8217;t have X11, mono fails to run Windows Forms code with the following
</I>&gt;<i> error:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From: System.Windows.Forms, at: Void .ctor(), Error Message: The type
</I>&gt;<i> initializer for 'System.Windows.Forms.WindowsFormsSynchronizationContext'
</I>&gt;<i> threw an exception.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Question First:
</I>&gt;<i> The main question I had for the Mono list is this.  Is it possible to have
</I>&gt;<i> mono run Windows Forms code without trying to open X11 (I.e. headless
</I>&gt;<i> mode)?  What triggers mono to request an X11 display? Is it the project
</I>&gt;<i> type?  Is it the call to an object that inherits from a Windows Forms
</I>&gt;<i> control?  I don&#8217;t need to see the form, but if I&#8217;m using BackgroundWorkers,
</I>&gt;<i> I need the form's event handler, don&#8217;t I?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Details Last:
</I>&gt;<i> Requirements dictate that make every attempt possible to keep a single
</I>&gt;<i> code base.  I.e., either if&#8217;s or #ifdefs if different code needs to run on
</I>&gt;<i> Linux than on Windows.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The code uses multiple concurrent BackgroundWorkers (it&#8217;s a .net 2.0 app,
</I>&gt;<i> and we currently don&#8217;t have permission to move it to 4.0 and thread pools)
</I>&gt;<i> that process data in parallel.  We&#8217;re trying to run this code on a large
</I>&gt;<i> Linux-based HPC system that uses a batch (PBS) queueing system.  The
</I>&gt;<i> problem is that we do not have X11  available on the compute nodes (well,
</I>&gt;<i> at least not unless we&#8217;re in interactive mode, and that&#8217;s against the
</I>&gt;<i> requirements).  There is a large amount of logic that is tied into using
</I>&gt;<i> BackgroundWorkers, and those seem to require a visible form to provide an
</I>&gt;<i> event loop to handle events generated by the BackgroundWorkers.
</I>&gt;<i> Essentially, this app was designed to only be run interactively, but now
</I>&gt;<i> we&#8217;re both parallelizing it, as well as giving it a headless option (I.e.
</I>&gt;<i> if a command line option is given, we&#8217;re running with no GUI).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. We tried creating a Windows Console app in Visual Studio, essentially a
</I>&gt;<i> driver, that then instantiated the the forms and ran them.  Although
</I>&gt;<i> nothing is shown on the screen, it still required us to use X11. giving the
</I>&gt;<i> error at the top of this message.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  We tried just not using BackgroundWorkers.  This meant the code was
</I>&gt;<i> single threaded, but it still relies on logic in the Windows forms.  We
</I>&gt;<i> could move this logic to classes that don&#8217;t have anything to do with
</I>&gt;<i> Windows Forms, but now we have two code bases, essentially.  However, it
</I>&gt;<i> still fails even though we don&#8217;t display anything on screen, we get the
</I>&gt;<i> error at the top of this message.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3.  Xvfb.  This works on local VM&#8217;s, but not on our cluster, which we
</I>&gt;<i> don&#8217;t have admin rights to (it&#8217;s not installed).  There is a possibility
</I>&gt;<i> that we could install X11-Xvfb from source, but this seems overkill.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4.  Worst case option - remove all background worker logic, and change it
</I>&gt;<i> to just use C# threads.  REALLY don&#8217;t want to do this if we don&#8217;t have to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know this may be confusing, and if so, please feel free to ask for
</I>&gt;<i> clarifications, or even just to say &#8220;Why would you want to do that?&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers.
