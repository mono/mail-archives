<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I might be ignorent, but is the board ment for programmers looking for
</I>&gt;<i> work, is it only for companies looking to get some work done or both?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Currently, our focus is to enable companies to post job/contract listings.
 We may let listings run the other way at some point in the future, but
this requires something a little different than what we've currently put
together, and we're not yet sure that the alternative is what employers or
developers want.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The other thing, how about a bug insentive, where one could post a reward
</I>&gt;<i> for fixing a specific bug report? I know the company I work at would
</I>&gt;<i> probably be okay chipping in to get a speficic bug fixed from time to time
</I>&gt;<i> when we hit them..
</I>

There is some overlap inasmuch as a company can post a job listing that is
essentially &quot;We need someone to address this bug/these bugs&quot;;
however, we're launching the job board because we get a lot of requests
from people willing to pay for Mono expertise, but the requests are far
more often in the form of &quot;Help us deliver a project on Mono.&quot; or &quot;We have
some issues, but we don't know what they are.&quot;

A bug-fixing-reward board would be something different than what we've
built, and is probably a discussion for a separate thread.
