<PRE>You did not understand my point(s).

The FIRST point is, that with the Boehm GC, I can create objects really
fast. Even 500 millions. BUT when the memory consumption is over 4 GB, it
crashes under some conditions when you want to create a new object. So the
point of my test program is to create many big objects just to demonstrate
that Mono crashes after 500 objects IF your memory consumption is already
over 4 GB when you reach that point.

The SECOND point is, that SGen GC has NOT this limitation, BUT it has a
serious speed issue. When you create 500 million objects with each one 100
bytes, you come up with 50 GB of memory consumption. This WORKS in SGen, but
it goes slower and slower the more memory I already use. When I have reached
12 GB, it can be said its then unusable.

Conclusion: Either I can use Boehm and take care that I do not use more than
4 GB of Ram, since its dangerous to create new objects then, OR I can use
SGen and create up to 100 million of objects, because then its slow.

In the end this means I can NOT create 500 millions of objects, which
require about 50 GB of Ram. SGen is too slow for that and Boehm crashes.
