<PRE>Sorry for being unclear. I am working in the context of adaptive
optimization. Maybe I would use a small example:

Method mthA {
   =20
     // Call some method B here
}

What I want to do is have the JIT patch the code of mthA as it is =
compiling
it such that it becomes:

Method mthA {
   =20
     if (condition) {
         // Call some method C
     }
     else {
         // Call some method B here
     }
}

Now there are some requirement:
1. &quot;condition&quot; is a reference to internal data of the runtime, e.g. the
execution count of a method, or some info that is collected from the
profiler.
2. The condition check is done as &quot;mthA&quot; is actually executing.

Basically, the runtime passed a reference of some data, to a piece of =
user
code. And the user code checked that data for some condition.

I can certainly do the patching in &quot;mono_method_to_ir()&quot;. But the =
problem is
how I can enable such condition check from user code to internal data
structure of the runtime. And do it quickly.

Thanks.

Derek


&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am experimenting with some ideas using mono. I hope this is not=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; off-topic.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I want to modify the JIT of mono to insert some code to=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; methods when they are being JIT -ted. Specifically, I need to insert =
</I>a=20
&gt;<i> &gt; check to some internal variables declared in the mono runtime (e.g.=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an int, a  single bit, etc). The problem is that these are =
</I>&quot;unmanaged&quot;
stuff=20
&gt;<i> &gt; existing in the runtime's address space. And I must insert  the =
</I>check=20
&gt;<i> &gt; to User's code that are &quot;managed&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I need a way to insert this check crossing the &quot;managed&quot; /=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;unmanaged&quot; boundary. I know the &quot;Marshal&quot; class would do that for =
</I>me.=20
&gt;<i> &gt; But I am guess it might be too slow. Are there other ways to do it?
</I>Maybe the=20
&gt;<i> &gt; only better way is to patch up the native code after the code gen

&gt;<i> &gt; Any insight is appreciated. Thanks.
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> You should describe in more detail what you are after.  There=20
</I>&gt;<i> is a pluggable profiling interface that you might want to=20
</I>&gt;<i> look into (code coverage and profiling are implemented this way).
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> For more technical stuff, you might want to patch directly=20
</I>&gt;<i> the code generation engine.
