<PRE>There is a problem with file downloads from your go-mono site, particularly 
tar.gz source archives, including the daily snapshots.  I think it is 
something in the http header - which is sending incorrect file size info. to 
clients which then corrupts the downloads.  

I have confirmed this with Mozilla, Konqueror and IE browsers on Win32 and 
Linux, and it has been a problem for several weeks now.

Download of the same file from a mirror of your site is fine.
