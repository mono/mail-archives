Ditto to it being hard to code after hours, especially with a wife and
the tons of study I do to keep up on the MS platform alone. I try to set
a goal of getting something done each night, but am not too strict about
that. Much of that may however be doing some admin/changes to my
hardware setup (got 7 machines now, and I tend to tinker a bit much) or
catching up on the mailing lists and email.

Weekends are generally better since I can have a few hours on the trot,
but it's still hard just to keep up with the pace of change and
re-compiles, let alone contribute anything more than bug reports.

If you set yourself a little time a few times a week, and a few hours on
the weekend it should be possible to keep contributing.

Sigh, now back to my admin stuff...
