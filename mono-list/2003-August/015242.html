<PRE>I remember someone mentioning this earlier and part of the problem might 
be that the MIME type is being sent as a gzip, which causes many 
browsers to attempt to ungzip it as they download it.

Right click -&gt; save as usually fixes the problem.

Of course, I might be wrong on the underlying technological reasons, I 
don't run the site, I'm just some wag on the internet.
