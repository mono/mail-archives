Ah! I think we may have been talking cross purposes.

I remember reading on the mono website a few weeks ago that in order to
use WinForms it was necessary to have Wine installed and build mono from
the CVS source. I remember thinking at the time that this was a little
strange as I had downloaded the GTK# RPMs a long with the mono RPMs.

So, am I right in thinking that you do not need Wine or to build mono
from the CVS source to use WinForms and that you only need to install
the GTK# RPMs along with the mono RPMs?
