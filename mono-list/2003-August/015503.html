You'll have to modify autogen.sh to use &quot;glibtool&quot; and &quot;glibtoolize&quot; 
instead.  Apple has their own program called &quot;libtool&quot; that's an 
internal part of the linking process that's unrelated to GNU libtool, 
and you're getting that instead.

It's difficult to say, it could be related to the libtool issue, so you 
never got a consistent configure script.

I believe mini actually compiles on OSX now, although I've not managed 
to bootstrap mcs.  I've only played with it off and on.

We put a lot of thought into our defaults.  We like them.  If we
didn't, we would have made something else be the default.  So keep
your cotton-pickin' hands off our defaults.  Don't touch.  Consider
them mandatory.  &quot;Mandatory defaults&quot; has a nice ring to it.
