I think this is a good idea as one of the major downers for me is that 
I'm having difficulty building mono so that I can use Forms. It's 
almost at the point where I'm going to switch to Windows and Visual 
Studio, which is something I really don't want to do.

I'm missing your point. Why can't built versions of the wrappers be 
shipped in the pacakge? :-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This would make deployment much easier!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A worst case scenario:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I user wants to run a simple Mono/GTK# application and is a real

&gt;<i> &gt; First he has to install Mono, but the application still does not

&gt;<i> &gt; Now he tries to install GTK# but there are so many dependencies 
</I>because 
&gt;<i> &gt; of GTK+....
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This user will use a wore C app before installing all required

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's up to the packager to correctly specify all the dependencies, 
</I>just
&gt;<i> as it is for the packager of the C app.
</I>
In that case, why hasn't it been done? Or has it and I've missed it 
somewhere? I know there are gtk RPMs that can be downloaded from the 
mono website. :-)
