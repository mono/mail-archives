<PRE>One has to wonder, then, why you would follow Mono if you have no interest 
in .NET?

Speaking abstractly, the open source community should favor a standard held 
by an international standards body (CLI &amp; C#) as opposed by a single vendor 
(Java). Speaking practically, the open source community should favor an 
environment where they can easily wrap all their legacy open source code 
(CLI/Interop) over one where they cannot (Java/RMI). Speaking in terms of 
self preservation, it pays to stay relevant and compatible with the, not 
800, but 1000 pound gorilla (see it's also simian!), namely Microsoft. In 
the end they call the shots. That’s why, pragmatically, generics exist in 
the emerging Mono C#--if MS had no inclination to add generics I highly 
doubt they would be in Mono. Just a fact of life.

Following the same vein, then, most users of CLI are VS.NET users. Opening a 
wide door to them opens lots of doors for the Mono community. Personally, 
I'm a big believer in the CLI/FCL and the technologies on top of them, and I 
want to program in them regardless of what platform I am writing for. How 
much better if I can have single source/single environment solution!

No flame wars, man, but what's up with the &quot;replace java in corporate&quot;
perspective ?!
I mean I for one don't like .net at all and would have tomes to speak
against it, but i don't do that except when I'm asked to...
