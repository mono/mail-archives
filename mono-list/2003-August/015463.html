<PRE>Hello Fabio,

I have received a few e-mails about the availability of Mono 0.26
binaries on Windows. I'll be working on getting them out this week.

I also want to say that it is a personal goal of mine to get the Windows
build integrated into the release process in time for the next release
(0.27). Hopefully, by then, we'll have packages for the various Linux
distributions and builds for Windows all done at the same time.

Duncan.
