<PRE>Hi!

I recently got a job as a asp.net programmer at a company here in sweden and 
one of the things that they really liked was that i had contributed to mono. 
So contributing  really fun , and it can also help you get that job you want. 

So i really think you guys who passive observers of this project should 
consider to contribute if you have the time to do it, its fun.! 

Since im not a student anymore i have discovered that it is really hard to 
find time to do any coding at all after 8 hours of <A HREF="mailto:coding@work.">coding@work.</A> When do u 
other guys/gals who work do you coding? weeknights or weekends? I really wish 
that i can get used to long working hours ao that i have the energy to sit 
down and some coding for mono again :) 

Best regards
 Per Arneng
