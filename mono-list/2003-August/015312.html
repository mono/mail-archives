<PRE>Here is the page for SharpWT (SWT)
<A HREF="http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SharpWT/">http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SharpWT/</A>

The mailing list is mentioned there too.

I have not received any email from it in a while. I think the core team is
focusing on 1.0 for now instead of porting to Linux.

Not to sidetrack the discussion, but is there somewhere I can get some
information on the progress of the SWT/Sharpdevelop stuff?  I keep poking
around on their site, but I either haven't found the forum where everyone is
talking about this or the interest has died to a level that there isn't such
a forum.
  I've played with SharpDevelop on windows and would love to have that
available under linux so if I can help move things along, I'd be happy to.
