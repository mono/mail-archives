  Subject: [Mono-devel-list] Mono 0.26 has been released


  Mono 0.26 Release

  Hello everyone,

  A new release of the Mono runtime and SDK is available for UNIX and
Windows. Packages for various distributions are also available from our
download page.

  Since the last release, 1,591 individual commits were done to our runtime
and class libraries (out of 2,700 commits to the repository).

  189 bugzilla bugs were closed.

  I know that the following summary is incomplete, I apologize for missing
major features

  We continue our SourceGear contract, so you will see a lot more stability
and bug fixes in the area of networking, web services and the core of Mono.



  1. Availability

  2. New Features in this release.
    Peter Williams authored our new unified build system (before we had two
build paths: one for Unix and one for Windows), and Gonzalo helped with the
roll-out. Thanks to the two of them for assisting us in the migration.

    The new build system supports profiles; Currently we support .NET 1.0,
.NET 1.1 and the experimental Generics profile (for the Generics
extensions).

    Andreas Nahr continued his quest to fix the signatures, attributes and
visibility in all of our class libraries. Also he has been adding the proper
AssemblyInfo files to all of our assemblies as well as adding Locale
support.
  Runtime
    Thread pool management has been fixed to have the same semantics as
.NET; Lots of bugs have been fixed there.

    Portability fixes, and progress on the Power PC port. Chris and Mark
have initiated a SPARC port of the JIT engine and Malte contributed fixes to
the ARM port.
  C# Compiler
    Martin, Ravi and Miguel fixed the top 88 most wanted bugs in the C#
compiler, needless to say, we are very proud of the reliability and
conformance of our compiler.

    It was a fantastic compiler, now it is even better. Thanks to everyone
who contributed bug reports for MCS, keep them coming.

    Also MCS has gone through a memory usage diet, and we have increased the
performance on this release mostly by reducing the memory usage. We did this
by using Mono's integrated profiler.

    Big outstanding bugs have been dealt with, and we are on a final pass to
close the existing known problems before we jump into the anonymous methods
and generics support.
  Tools
    Lluis contributed a new XSD tool based on the new XmlSerialization code.
This version is more complete than our old XSD. It is now possible to create
C# classes from a Xml Schema file and also create an XML schema out of a C#
class
  IL Assembler
    Jackson got our IL assembler passing all of the Rotor tests, and also
has added support for Generics.

    We used our assembler to test our runtime engine generics support.
  System.Net
    Gonzalo added support for proxies as well as fixing plenty of bugs in
NetworkStream, Socket and HttpWebRequest.

    Jerome contributed the IPV6 support to Mono, which is only available if
you build with the .NET 1.1 profile mode.
  Web Services world
    Lluis worked on adding support for server side ASP.NET web services,
including complex parameters, in/out parameters, async calls, Soap headers
and Soap extensions.

    We also ship some nice examples in the XSP server that make use of the
Web Services extension features (Dump, Encrypt and Trace samples included).

    Gonzalo and Daniel made the mod_mono Apache module work with both 1.3
and 2.0 editions of Apache. This version also uses a separate process to
host Mono, so we get the right caching semantics.

    Work on the various pieces of WSDL continues.
  Web Forms
    Plenty of updates to the ASP.NET to conform to the new features in .NET
1.1, as well as many controls from Gaurav to support the Mobile class
libraries.

    Gonzalo and Lluis got the Web Services .asmx and .ashx files supported
in our web hosting facilities (both XSP and Apache).
  Xml Serialization
    Lluis improved the XmlSerializer. It now supports all attributes for
customizing xml output.

    Lluis implemented the XmlSchemaImporter and XmlCodeExporter. They also
improved primitive type support in xml schema.

    Atsushi and Lluis improved XmlSchema compilation support. It now
supports more precise schema object information.
  Windows.Forms and System.Drawing
    Alexandre Pigolkine and Aleksey Ryabchuk did most of the work on
System.Windows.Forms and System.Drawing. Duncan and myself did janitorial
work on the code base.

    Bmp, Jpeg codecs improved, PngCodec added.

    Xr implementation: It is possible to load an image, paint on it and save
modified image to a file: Currently 24bpp and 32bpp formats are supported.

    Duncan and Larry Ewing (yes, that Larry Ewing) improved our Xr-based
rendering engine, which continues to move along

    Wine implementation improved to support image visualization.

    MDI Forms work on Linux.

    FileDialog is compatible with Wine, ColorDialog implemented. The dialogs
were not tested with WineLib package (looks like it does not support common
dialogs).

    Implementation of some controls (Button,Label,RadioButton,CheckBox)
changed to be compatible with documentation and to work with WineLib
package.

    Some bugs, revealed by samples at
<A HREF="http://www.nullenvoid.com/mono/wiki/index.php/WineSamples,">http://www.nullenvoid.com/mono/wiki/index.php/WineSamples,</A> are fixed.

    Switched to WineLib by default.
  XML support
    The work to implement a fully managed version of Xslt (System.Xml.Xsl)
is making enourmous progress. The effort is being coordinated by Ben who has
done an amazing job in implementing Xslt in record time. Both Atsushi and
Piers made very big contributions to the effort.

    Monodoc is now capable of running completely with our managed
implementation of Xslt. This is good, because we will now be able to
implement properly the XPathNavigator-based interfaces without having to
resort to temporary files, and we also get the proper threading semantics.

    Piers did an great job at fixing XPath as the work on Xstl progressed.
He also fixed the various bugs reported by the Dashboard hackers (Variable
handling, improved namespace support, sorting support and so on).

    Atsushi also got XPathDocument and its XPathNavigator implemented.
XmlDocument's XPathNavigator has been also improved and is a lot faster
thanks to the new architecture. They are now almost finised.

    On the DTD support: XmlValidatingReader validatation, entity handling,
ID and default attribute support in XmlDocument and XPathNavigator.

    Improved well-formedness check in XmlTextReader and XmlNodeWriter was
implemented, in relation to managed XSLT (Atsushi).
  Security
    C14N support has finally been added to System.Security assembly thanks
to Aleksey Sanin!

    Added missing classes/methods to System.Security,
System.Security.Permissions, System.Security.Policies and
System.Security.Principal. We now have a much better signature compatibility
with the framework. [Duncan, Sebastien]

    New unit tests in System.Security.Permissions, System.Security.Policies
and System.Security.Principal. (Sebastien)

    All (known) bugs are fixed in CryptoStream. (Sebastien)

    MonoTODO attributes under System.Security.* have been updated and should
reflect reality. (Sebastien)
  Remoting
    Improvements in Remoting infrastucture. Now it can run Remoting.Corba
out of the box. Both client and server channels work.

    Implemented HttpChannel, thanks to the work of Hussein Mehanna, Ahmad
Tantawy and Ahmad Kadry.
  JScript
    Progress from Cesar:

    Parser: Support for classes, enumerations, interfaces, packages.

    Code Generation: &quot;Hello mono::&quot; is back. (first jscript .net program
compiled by mjs).

    Public API: The stubs for the classes of the Microsoft.JScript namespace
public API are complete now.

    CodeGeneration and Semantic Analysis were supposed to be implemented as
Visitor classed, that will change. The methods Resolve () and Emit () will
be at each AST class.
  System.Design and CodeDom
    Andreas contributed a VB CodeDom provider and also implemented plenty of
functionality System.Design and also fixed roughly a thousand API entry
points in the API.
  Mono Cairo debuts
    Duncan has done Cairo bindings for Mono.


    In the next release we will drop our support for the old Xr bindings,
and move everything to the new Cairo API.

    .ashx files supported in our web hosting facilities (both XSP and =
Apache).=20
  &lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
  &lt;H3&gt;Xml Serialization&lt;/H3&gt;
  &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Lluis improved the XmlSerializer. It now supports all =
attributes=20
    for customizing xml output. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lluis implemented the =
XmlSchemaImporter=20
    and XmlCodeExporter. They also improved primitive type support in =
xml=20
    schema. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Atsushi and Lluis improved XmlSchema compilation =
support. It=20
    now supports more precise schema object information. &lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
  &lt;H3&gt;Windows.Forms and System.Drawing&lt;/H3&gt;
  &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Alexandre Pigolkine and Aleksey Ryabchuk did most of the =
work on=20
    System.Windows.Forms and System.Drawing. Duncan and myself did =
janitorial=20
    work on the code base.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bmp, Jpeg codecs improved, PngCodec =
added.=20
    &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Xr implementation: It is possible to load an image, paint on =
it and=20
    save modified image to a file: Currently 24bpp and 32bpp formats are =

    supported. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Duncan and Larry Ewing (yes, that Larry Ewing) =
improved=20
    our Xr-based rendering engine, which continues to move along =
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Wine=20
    implementation improved to support image visualization. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;MDI =
Forms=20
    work on Linux. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;FileDialog is compatible with Wine, =
ColorDialog=20
    implemented. The dialogs were not tested with WineLib package (looks =
like it=20
    does not support common dialogs). &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Implementation of some =
controls=20
    (Button,Label,RadioButton,CheckBox) changed to be compatible with=20
    documentation and to work with WineLib package. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some bugs, =
revealed=20
    by samples at &lt;A=20
    =
href=3D&quot;<A HREF="http://www.nullenvoid.com/mono/wiki/index.php/WineSamples"">http://www.nullenvoid.com/mono/wiki/index.php/WineSamples&quot;</A>&gt;&lt;U&gt;htt=

    are fixed. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Switched to WineLib by default. &lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
  &lt;H3&gt;XML support&lt;/H3&gt;
  &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;The work to implement a fully managed version of Xslt=20
    (System.Xml.Xsl) is making enourmous progress. The effort is being=20
    coordinated by Ben who has done an amazing job in implementing Xslt =
in=20
    record time. Both Atsushi and Piers made very big contributions to =
the=20
    effort. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Monodoc is now capable of running completely with =
our=20
    managed implementation of Xslt. This is good, because we will now be =
able to=20
    implement properly the XPathNavigator-based interfaces without =
having to=20
    resort to temporary files, and we also get the proper threading =
semantics.=20
    &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Piers did an great job at fixing XPath as the work on Xstl=20
    progressed. He also fixed the various bugs reported by the Dashboard =
hackers=20
    (Variable handling, improved namespace support, sorting support and =
so on).=20
    &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Atsushi also got XPathDocument and its XPathNavigator =
implemented.=20
    XmlDocument's XPathNavigator has been also improved and is a lot =
faster=20
    thanks to the new architecture. They are now almost finised. =
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;On the=20
    DTD support: XmlValidatingReader validatation, entity handling, ID =
and=20
    default attribute support in XmlDocument and XPathNavigator.=20
    &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Improved well-formedness check in XmlTextReader and =
XmlNodeWriter=20
    was implemented, in relation to managed XSLT (Atsushi). =
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
  &lt;H3&gt;Security&lt;/H3&gt;
  &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;C14N support has finally been added to System.Security =
assembly=20
    thanks to Aleksey Sanin! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Added missing classes/methods to=20
    System.Security, System.Security.Permissions, =
System.Security.Policies and=20
    System.Security.Principal. We now have a much better signature =
compatibility=20
    with the framework. [Duncan, Sebastien] &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;New unit tests in=20
    System.Security.Permissions, System.Security.Policies and=20
    System.Security.Principal. (Sebastien) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;All (known) bugs are =
fixed in=20
    CryptoStream. (Sebastien) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;MonoTODO attributes under=20
    System.Security.* have been updated and should reflect reality. =
(Sebastien)=20
  &lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
  &lt;H3&gt;Remoting&lt;/H3&gt;
  &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Improvements in Remoting infrastucture. Now it can run &lt;A=20

 out=20
    of the box. Both client and server channels work. =
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Implemented=20
    HttpChannel, thanks to the work of Hussein Mehanna, Ahmad Tantawy =
and Ahmad=20
    Kadry. &lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
  &lt;H3&gt;JScript&lt;/H3&gt;
  &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Progress from Cesar: &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Parser: Support for classes,=20
    enumerations, interfaces, packages. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Code Generation: &quot;Hello =
mono::&quot;=20
    is back. (first jscript .net program compiled by mjs). =
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Public API:=20
    The stubs for the classes of the Microsoft.JScript namespace public =
API are=20
    complete now. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;CodeGeneration and Semantic Analysis were =
supposed to=20
    be implemented as Visitor classed, that will change. The methods =
Resolve ()=20
    and Emit () will be at each AST class. &lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
  &lt;H3&gt;System.Design and CodeDom&lt;/H3&gt;
  &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Andreas contributed a VB CodeDom provider and also =
implemented=20
    plenty of functionality System.Design and also fixed roughly a =
thousand API=20
    entry points in the API. &lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
  &lt;H3&gt;Mono Cairo debuts&lt;/H3&gt;
  &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Duncan has done &lt;A=20
    href=3D&quot;<A HREF="http://www.cairographics.org/"">http://www.cairographics.org/&quot;</A>&gt;&lt;U&gt;Cairo&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/A&gt; bindings for =
Mono.=20
  &lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
  &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;In the next release we will drop our support for the old =
Xr=20
    bindings, and move everything to the new Cairo API. &lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
  &lt;H2&gt;3. The people behind this release&lt;/H2&gt;
