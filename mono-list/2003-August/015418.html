First of all, I would like to congratulate all of you mono hackers on
this new release. You are doing some amazing work here.

However, I have a problem installing this new release. I am maintaining
the mono installation at my university's RedHat system. I have
sucessfully installed mono 0.19 up to 0.24. But 0.26 refuses to be
installed.

I do not have root access on the machine(s). We have a student-run
organization called dikunix which maintains all kinds of software on the
system. On 0.24 and below I could install mono like this:

cd mono-0.24
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/dikunix
make
make install prefix=/usr/local/dikunix/work/mono/linux


As you can see the mono files are installed in a different location then
what is specified in configure. There is a script that creates symlinks
in /usr/local/dikunix to /usr/local/dikunix/work/mono/linux for all the
individual files.

One of the reasons for doing this is to ease maintaining the same
software on both linux on x86, HP-UX and alpha.

Anyway when I am doing the make install on 0.26 I get the following:
make install prefix=/usr/local/dikunix/work/mono/linux

(some output skipped)
/bin/sh ../../libtool --mode=install /usr/local/stow/bin/ginstall -c 
libmono.la /usr/local/dikunix/work/mono/linux/lib/libmono.la
libtool: install: error: cannot install `libmono.la' to a directory not
ending in /usr/local/dikunix/lib
make[3]: *** [install-libLTLIBRARIES] Error 1


Does anybody have any idea on how this could be made to work?

Thanks in advance
