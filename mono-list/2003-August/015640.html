Wouldn't it make more sense to just change method C to read:

	if (condition) {
		call method B;
		return;
	}
	... normal method C code ...

This way you keep code expansion low and it's easier to implement in the
JIT, since it's just stuff you can do in the prolog, for example.

&gt;<i> Now there are some requirement:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. &quot;condition&quot; is a reference to internal data of the runtime, e.g. the
</I>&gt;<i> execution count of a method, or some info that is collected from the

</I>&gt;<i> 2. The condition check is done as &quot;mthA&quot; is actually executing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, the runtime passed a reference of some data, to a piece of user
</I>&gt;<i> code. And the user code checked that data for some condition.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can certainly do the patching in &quot;mono_method_to_ir()&quot;. But the problem is
</I>&gt;<i> how I can enable such condition check from user code to internal data

</I>

You can do it in three ways:
*) in mono_method_to_ir () by generating the intermediate code directly
(this also means it will be portable). This is the reccomended way.
*) you can do it in mini-x86.c in emit_prolog: hackish non portable way.
*) you can do it using wrappers, like it's done for some methods in
metadata/marshal.c. It's portable, but you need to generate IL code and
it's more cumbersome and runtime-heavy.

I suggest the first way to do it. You may want to grep for coverage_info
in mini.c to see how a static unmanaged variable is accessed in the
internal representation. There are plenty of examples there on how to
call a method as well.
