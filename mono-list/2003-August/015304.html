We already do processor-specific optimizations, so it's not safe to copy
the output from --aot (when it will be safe, the file will be ignored).

Currently it's possible to build a single mono binary that includes
a set of assemblies: the assembly loader will try to load them first.
In this case, though, the LGPL requires that people should be able to
re-link the application to a new runtime, so there should be an option
for the users to also download the application separately.

&gt;<i> Additionally, as soon as you had a second .net application to
</I>&gt;<i> distribute, you'd have to do all that again, likely requiring more disk
</I>&gt;<i> space than if you had just installed the redistributable in the first

</I>
Yes. I'll note, though, that if the issue is really the size of the
runtime, mono is much smaller than the MS runtime;-)
