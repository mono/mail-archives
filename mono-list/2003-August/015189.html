</I>Actually, you can compile from source.

They should get a copy of the latest version from cvs
(<A HREF="http://go-mono.com/daily">http://go-mono.com/daily</A>), or the latest release (0.25), and extract
the files from the tarball. They can then execute:

./configure --prefix=/path/to/prefix

Where /path/to/prefix is a directory where they can write to. Folders
such as bin/ and lib/ will be made, they have the traditional functions.
They must then set MONO_PATH to lib/, and make sure bin/ is in their
path. They should then be all set.

It may be easier, however, for your users to ask a system administrator
to install the latest RPM. If they use Red Carpet, this would be as
simple as:

rug in mono

Otherwise, they can download the latest release and install the RPM.

If you have any more questions, please feel free to ask. I am glad to
hear you are looking into deploying Mono.
