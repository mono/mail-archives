<PRE>Summary: No, you're wrong in thinking that you don't need Wine and CVS
mono to use WinForms.

WinForms is not Gtk#.  WinForms currently has two backends: the
Wine-based implementation, and a GTK+ implementation.  The Wine-based
implementation is getting most of the attention (you can consider the
GTK+ version to be a research project for now).

As such, you *must* have Wine installed in order to use WinForms under
mono.  However, you can't just use any Wine installation.  You have to
use a Wine installation that has the appropriate patches.  The Wine
patches can be found at:

	<A HREF="http://www.openlinksw.com/mono/">http://www.openlinksw.com/mono/</A>

Miguel originally discussed this in:

	<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2003-May/014079.html">http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2003-May/014079.html</A>

However, you don't need to apply the patches and compile Wine yourself. 
RPM packages are available from the mono download page.  See Duncan's
original email:

	<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2003-July/015120.html">http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2003-July/015120.html</A>

Additionally, you have to use CVS mono because the last mono release
(0.25) has a less complete WinForms implementation than CVS.  So, you
can either use CVS to get the better WinForms support, or wait for the
next mono release (0.26).
