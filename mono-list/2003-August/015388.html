<PRE>Hello,
 
&gt;<i> I have been following the Mono development effort in parallel to the
</I>&gt;<i> Rotor initiative (with also I have worked some bits and pieces).
</I>&gt;<i> Comparing the two, I found that the work being done towards Mono
</I>&gt;<i> development not only provides a good learning environment but also
</I>&gt;<i> very intellectually stimulating.
</I>
Am glad to hear that Gaurav!

&gt;<i> I have joined the various Mono mailing lists, and would like to start
</I>&gt;<i> contributing by working with Microsoft.Win32 namespace in the corlib
</I>&gt;<i> assembly. I have downloaded the latest (0.25) Mono source, and would
</I>&gt;<i> be working on it against .NET 1.1/WinXP to build it. Do let me know
</I>&gt;<i> whom to get in touch for this assembly, and how to proceed to check in
</I>&gt;<i> the source once I am done.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Looking forward to a fruitful development for the community.
</I>
Thanks, we will be happy to assist you becoming a contributor.

Miguel
