<PRE>Hi,

I am experimenting with some ideas using mono. I hope this is not =
off-topic.

I want to modify the JIT of mono to insert some code to methods when =
they
are being JIT -ted. Specifically, I need to insert a check to some =
internal
variables declared in the mono runtime (e.g. an int, a single bit, etc). =
The
problem is that these are &quot;unmanaged&quot; stuff existing in the runtime's
address space. And I must insert the check to User's code that are
&quot;managed&quot;.

I need a way to insert this check crossing the &quot;managed&quot; / &quot;unmanaged&quot;
boundary. I know the &quot;Marshal&quot; class would do that for me. But I am =
guess it
might be too slow. Are there other ways to do it? Maybe the only better =
way
is to patch up the native code after the code gen process? Any insight =
is
appreciated. Thanks.

Regards,
Derek Woo
