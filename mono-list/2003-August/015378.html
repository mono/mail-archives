I have also ran into this problem before. Most of the time, my solution
is to just read the Mono source code. I know it's kinda lame, but it is
one way to find out what methods are available for the classes.

Lately, I've also been using Monodoc. I use it mostly as a Gtk#
reference and it works pretty well. On top of Gtk# documentation, we
distribute files for the FCL (BCL?) as well, based on the ECMA
documentation (a subset of the whole MS set), along with stubs of the
Types and methods that were in the MS set but not the ECMA set. So we
should have all the type/method listing that MS has in their 1.0
documentation.

The FCL documentation in monodoc should be pretty useful and handy if
you're just interested in finding out the methods and properties
available for a particular class; if you want more in depth
explanations, unless what you are looking for is covered by the ECMA
docs, your best bet is reading the source for now.

However, we always welcome contributions to documentation... ;-)

Duncan.
