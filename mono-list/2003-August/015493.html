<PRE>The mappings are hard coded into a file which is installed by mono.  It
would be nice if there were a tool to alter the config file at install
time.  On linux, I could just do an ldd libgtksharpglue.so and grep out
the versioned so names. Not sure about the portability of such an
approach, but it obviously doesn't need to be portable to win32 at
least.

There are packages for gtkhtml3 available through red carpet's Evolution
channel or associated ftp directory.

No, you want /etc/mono/config
