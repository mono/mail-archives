<PRE>Hi Stephen,

I apologize, I lacked clarity in my previous post.

The Ubuntu issue mentioned by Daniel is a real problem, we're always 
versions behind and it's frustrating.
In light of the recent changes, it is worth considering if an opportunity 
existed to address some of these issues.

It would be great to have the ability to install the latest Mono across 
multiple platforms, ie. Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, Windows, etc.
Bringing Mono up to date in Ubuntu would be awesome, for Mono and for 
Ubuntu.

&gt;<i>From the feedback to Daniel's initial post, it has been made manifest to me 
</I>that there is a lot more work
that goes into the packaging of Mono than I realized, and there are other 
issues such as distribution policies,
application installation base compatibilities, etc.

I am very grateful to you and everybody else who makes Mono available to us.

Just to clarify, it wasn't openSUSE or SUSE that laid off the mono
team.  And to be technical, it wasn't Novell either.  In case you
missed it, Attachemate recently bought Novell, split SUSE off and
canned the mono team.  Since you mention Attachemate one would have to
ask if your are just trolling at this point?

Cheers,
Stephen
