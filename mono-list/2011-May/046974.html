<PRE>I think you will be pleasantly surprised at the compatibility and maturity of
Mono when working with ASP.NET. The core is quite solid.

It depends on what else you want to include of course. Not all Microsoft
tchnologies are supported. You would have trouble if you tried to use WCF
heavily for example and LINQ to Entities is not supported at all. You
probably would not be using these anyway but I wanted to point it out.

If you are going to use ASP.NET MVC, MVC2 ships out of the box with Mono now
and works very well. The Razor view engine is not open source though so you
need to bring in a few Microsoft assemblies to use. MVC3. It does work
though. I have launched an MVC3 app on OS X.

Probably anything you build on Mono will run fine on .NET and I have never
had much trouble moving the other way. I would want to test on Mac often if
my primary dev environment was .NET on Windows. Given that you are going the
other way, you should be fine.

I assume you will be using MonoDevelop on the Mac and Visual Studio on
Windows. Another consideration is how you are handling unit tests etc.
