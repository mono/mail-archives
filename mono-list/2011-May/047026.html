I could only imagine, I prefer to develop software as I have the advantage 
of
being able to copy other peoples code :)

Let's hope the guys who lost their jobs are doing okay, it's not a good time 
to
be looking for work...

Thanks a million again to you, meebey, directhex and everybody else's 
efforts
to make Mono available.

I'm not sure anyone truly understands all the effort especially the
initial effort it takes to get stuff packaged and pushed out :)

Even though I'm not a debian/ubuntu user I think it would be great to
have mono up to date on there as well.  You can ask meebey and
directhex, I've bugged them enough :)

It certainly makes packaging easier with the latest stuff.  That has
been one of the biggest headaches for me and the packages I was trying
to package on ubuntu.  Not to mention the policy stuff.  It took me
longer to get the debian licensing stuff done than it took me to
package my stuff on openSUSE and fedora.

Cheers,
Stephen
