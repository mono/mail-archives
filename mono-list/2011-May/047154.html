The community is certainly not a concern, I have read many blog posts praising MonoTouch which was one of the reasons I started to make use of the trial product.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HomeSite.  I cried when Macromedia bought them, and sure enough, that was

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> many years before I finally retired it from daily use. I'm hoping to get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at least a year out of MonoTouch before it's truly &quot;obsolete&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Or am I just being overly optimistic or naive?
</I>

My biggest concern is purely upgrades. I have read many tweets/posts suggesting that Attachmate/Novell are not activating new licenses (I have no proof this is true other than the number of posts), and since the core development team is no longer a part of Attachmate/Novell I see no way they could produce an update for iOS 5. Suggesting the product will quickly become outdated. (Lets say by the end of the keynote at WWDC).


&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am with you. MonoTouch is a polished product now. Even without another
</I>&gt;<i> update, it is easily worth the license fee ($399) to be able to use C#
</I>&gt;<i> instead of Objective-C for the next year.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Xamarin says that their upcoming product will work with my MonoTouch
</I>&gt;<i> code-base so my effort is not wasted. I will have a path forward. If it
</I>&gt;<i> really takes less than six months for the Xamarin product to arrive, I am
</I>&gt;<i> betting that I can transition to it before any major issues appear (like
</I>&gt;<i> support for iOS 5 or something).
</I>
6 months is a very long time, easily enough time for me to convert what I have done into Objective-C and complete the App.

I am sure the product produced by Xamarin will be as polished if not more so. Finishing this app in Objective-C will not stop me from using the Xamarin product for future Apps.
