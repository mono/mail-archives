1) If the Mono-General list is not the appropriate question to ask how the
NEW OWNER of Mono laying off a large number of its workforce will impact the
Mono project then where is?

I feel this is a very serious question in light of Attachmate's acquisition
of Novell. They are already selling off all of Novell's pattens to a holding
group organized Microsoft. So what are they going to do with Mono?

I am sure they do not want to keep it.  They chances of Attachment selling
of the intellectual property rights for Mono to another company are high.  

Don't get me wrong I don't think Mono is going away, and has a great future
ahead of it with it seeming to be about ready to accelerate. However the
accusation and layoffs could seriously impact the development time lines and
road map in some way. 

2) I have talked with several Novell employees current and past that I know
and they state that some of the Novell based contributors are located in
Provo. 

This is a legitimate question and concern that many people have been having
since last Wednesday, and now with recent layoffs just becomes more
worrisome. 

So let me be clear my question is very serious and it is direct to the
leaders of the Mono project who are the ones who can truly know or at least
predict the future.
