I am with you. MonoTouch is a polished product now. Even without another
update, it is easily worth the license fee ($399) to be able to use C#
instead of Objective-C for the next year.

Xamarin says that their upcoming product will work with my MonoTouch
code-base so my effort is not wasted. I will have a path forward. If it
really takes less than six months for the Xamarin product to arrive, I am
betting that I can transition to it before any major issues appear (like
support for iOS 5 or something).

Mono for Android is not as mature unfortunately. I am not as happy relying
on it to create shipping applications. Luckily for me, I have have not
created anything significant with it yet. In the end, I decided to stick
with it as it will likely take me almost as long to start launching real
apps as it will for Xamarin to write a replacement product. I am going to
use it mostly for internal projects for now.

I guess it all comes down to how confident you are that Xamarin will pull
off nice products to transition to within a reasonable time frame. I
personally have confidence in them but others might assess the situation
differently.

For a few days there, I just wanted to be sure that Novell did not get my
money. Then I realised that penalising my company in an attempt to punish
Novell just made no sense. Who cares about them? They will be dead to me
soon enough. In the meantime, I want to be able to use the best tools
available.

I also had to wrestle with the idea of buying licenses now that I would have
to replace with Xamarin products later. Well, the Novell products only
included updates for one year as it was. I would likely have been paying to
upgrade them sometime after that anyway. Moving to the Xamarin products when
they are ready just means doing this 4-8 months from now instead. The
productivity gains (and joy) of being able to use C# in the meantime is more
than worth the money (for me at least).

Quick question(s)...

If you were one of the ex-Novell employees that got sacked by Attachmate,
how motivated would you be the kick their ass in the marketplace? If you
felt that your vision was constrained by &quot;big company issues&quot; at Novell, how
excited would you be now to run with your ideas?

The Mono team is talented, experienced, and driven. If I think about how
much value I am going to get out of these products in the next few years, it
feels like I am better off now than I was with the team all at Novell. Have
a some delay in before &quot;upgraded&quot; versions are available and/or having to
invest slightly more to get them seems completely worth it.
