I'm not sure anyone truly understands all the effort especially the
initial effort it takes to get stuff packaged and pushed out :)

Even though I'm not a debian/ubuntu user I think it would be great to
have mono up to date on there as well.  You can ask meebey and
directhex, I've bugged them enough :)

It certainly makes packaging easier with the latest stuff.  That has
been one of the biggest headaches for me and the packages I was trying
to package on ubuntu.  Not to mention the policy stuff.  It took me
longer to get the debian licensing stuff done than it took me to
package my stuff on openSUSE and fedora.

Cheers,
Stephen
