Great info!  Thanks..

As far as what becomes of MonoTouch (though it seems like most of the
/real/ work is part of the open source dependencies) is up to
Attachmate..  However, I could see three possible scenarios:

1) Attachmate just abandons the MonoTouch code (if they're mean)
2) Attachmate open-sources the whole thing (if they're nice)
3) Attachmate sells the IP to Xamian for cheap (if such a deal could
be worked out)..

I'm very glad to see the Mono guys are still all together - starting a
new company was an awesome idea, I'm definitely a bit jealous..  If I
had some money I'd want to help fund this effort..

Mike
