<PRE>Hi there,

I'm posting this here in the hopes the mono-list is slightly more populated
that the asp sublist.

Basically the issue I have is this:

I can compile an MVC 2.0 application under mono (great) but I can't actually
run it.

xsp2 appears to only serve old-style apps where there is a 1-1 mapping
between the file system and files, with each .aspx file having an associated
.aspx.cs code-behind file. This is not how MVC apps work.

MVC apps should have their urls parsed and run according to the routing
information defined for that application; typically the
/{controller}/{action} url is mapped to the function {action} in the class
Controller{controller} in the project. Under no circumstances should the
webserver randomly start trying to load aspx files from purely from the url
pattern.

I've seen a few vague posts about something called 'xsp4' that is somehow
capable of doing this (for example this page mentions it with regard to
using razor:
<A HREF="http://twistedcode.net/blog/post/2011/02/03/Orchard-begins-to-work-under-Mono.aspx">http://twistedcode.net/blog/post/2011/02/03/Orchard-begins-to-work-under-Mono.aspx</A>),
and is possibly packaged as part of the mono develop package, but I can't
find any concrete information on where to actually get this.

Also, if it's part of mono develop, that's not particularly useful for, for
example, actually hosting a web app that uses MVC on a real server.

Is this part of the git repo somewhere?

I build mono 2.10 from source on my server, but I couldn't find the sources
to xsp anywhere.

help~

cheers,
Doug.
