I don't think you fully understand what you are asking for.  Having
done both RPM and DEB packaging I'll take RPM (both openSUSE and
fedora) packaging especially in OBS  (OpenSUSE Build Service) any day
over debian packaging.  In fact, if the debian guys don't pick up the
packages I put together I'll most likely not support ubuntu.  Just
isn't worth my extremely limited free time that I have.  Ignoring the
large amount of complexity that comes with packaging for
debian/ubuntu, they package mono differently than on openSUSE and even
fedora for that matter.

Add in all of the different components, this isn't about just
packaging mono.  Its about all of the packaging that are
required/connected to mono.  They are generating and packaging an
entire developer platform/ecosystem not just some libraries.  Its very
impressive what these guys do.  It'd be unfair to not mention the
amount of time that ajorg puts into all of this.


Cheers,
Stephen

PS.  As an openSUSE user (Disclaimer) I'd be sad to see the support
drop.  What strikes me as odd is your request to drop support for an
entire distro and its users.  Coming from someone that is writing a
bible study application that doesn't seem very christian.
