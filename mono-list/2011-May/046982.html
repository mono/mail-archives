<PRE>Like I said, there is more of a problem doing all the dev on Windows and then
expecting it to work on Mac or Linux than there is working on the Mac and
expecting it to work on Windows. I am sure you will find that you can work
on your .NET code from within MonoDevelop on the Mac without problems.
MonoDevelop reads and writes the Visual Studio project and solution formats
natively. You should not have to go into Visual Studio to make any changes.

Mono does support LINQ. LINQ-to-Objects and LINQ-to-XML are both quite
mature. LINQ-to-SQL also works but is not as well tested (and I do not think
very much used) on Mono. It also supports more databases than the original
.NET version but I doubt that interests you much.

What Mono does not support is LINQ-to-Entities (the Entity Framework) which
is Microsoft's new ORM product. It competes with stuff like NHibernate
(which does work on Mono).

I realize that the rest of the team will be Windows (.NET) based so it makes
sense that you want your work to integrated effortlessly for them. You are a
great test suite though for making sure that your team is writing good
cross-platform code. There is probably no reason to use a technology that
does not work on Mono if you run into one. If that happens, you will catch
the issue very early. Similarly, you will catch any problems like
letter-case mismatches or hard-wired path separators that creep into .NET
projects but which should really be avoided.

In my mind, a Mono user on a .NET development team is a form of forced
quality control for a project.
