<PRE>Actually, I agree with Daniel, I think he is being both reasonable and forward thinking.

There is an opportunity now to broaden Mono&#8217;s usage via Ubuntu. 

If Java can be deployed seamlessly across platforms why can&#8217;t Mono? On Ubuntu 10.10 we can install parallel versions of Mono, but we can&#8217;t expect the end users to set up parallel environments just to run our applications.

The differences between Mono 2.10 and 2.6.7 are significant enough that as a developer you either drop Ubuntu as a target or you code large portions of your application for the lowest common denominator (2.6.7) &#8211; which is frustrating. 
Ubuntu&#8217;s acceptance of key Mono desktop projects has demonstrated that Mono has a lot to offer, and with Ubuntu being the best Linux experience (in my opinion) this is a really good opportunity that&#8217;s worth exploring.
Everybody is grateful for the efforts of Mirco Bauer and Jo Shields.
Daniel is just asking the question, and I think it is a good question worth investigating.

  Currently all my volunteer time is going into Wide Margin. And I foresee it taking up all my time in the near future. 

  However my suggestion is that the mono project drops open suse and instead supports ubuntu. 


  This would require no extra effort. And would get the latest mono to a larger user base.



This is where you're wrong&#8212;it would require extra effort. Not many of the &quot;Mono team&quot; members use Ubuntu (or any Debian-derivative, which means learning a whole new set of package management/building tools), and as Jon already pointed out, there are a very talented set of Debian packagers who do a much better job of making available proper packages for Debian and Debian derivatives than the Mono team ever could. There are better things for the newly-minted Xamarin team to focus on than duplicating work that is already done by two able and willing hands. If you want up-to-date Ubuntu packages, donate some cash or better yet, some time to either Mirco Bauer (meebey) or Jo Shields (directhex), who comprise the Mono packaging tag-team for Debian.

    &gt; I looking for upto date packages,
    &gt; 
    &gt; I&quot;m still waiting for 2.8 packages and 2.10 packages.
    &gt; 
    &gt; So what I'm looking for is when a new version of mono is released on the
    &gt; same day the new Ubuntu packages are available. Not a year or two or three
    &gt; later.

    &gt;&gt;
    &gt;&gt; How do you define &quot;official ubuntu support&quot;?
    &gt;&gt;
    &gt;&gt; The community has excellent Ubuntu packagers who know the best way to
    &gt;&gt; package Mono for Ubuntu, and submit these packages for inclusion in the
    &gt;&gt; official Ubuntu releases.
    &gt;&gt;
    &gt;&gt; So the short of it is: Mono is already packaged and included in Ubuntu.
    &gt;&gt;
    &gt;&gt; What more than that would you like to see?
