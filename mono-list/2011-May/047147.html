That was my first impression to when I heard.

Open Source &amp; Startups. The perfect mix ;-) Back to the good old Ximian days.

My only gripe is around MonoTouch. I was just in the process of building my first iPhone app and now we are back to square one. I know Xamarin will produce an ever better alternative &quot;.NET for iPhone&quot;. However this falls a little to late for me, so now I have to learn Objective-C, so I can complete what I started.

I only wish that Attachmate/Novell/SuSE actually did the full handover of all Mono projects to Xamarin.

Do Xamarin have any plans to create a new home for Mono and projects on the Internet, as from what I can see at the old Mono homepage, it has not been updated in some time.

Did a not-for-profit company ever get setup to maintain the Mono domains, homepage, IP, etc?

I wish Miguel, Nat and the rest of the Xamarin crew good fortune and for the Mono project to go from strength to strength.

As for Attachmate/Novell/SuSE, they have lost me as a Linux customer. I will be using Ubuntu from now on, and recommending that going forward.

Regards
Matt
