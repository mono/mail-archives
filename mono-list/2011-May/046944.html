<PRE>Hi Robert,

I tried that, but the help provided seems to be generic to configure and not
specific to XSP.  Maybe there is nothing specific to XSP and that is why.

However is failing ONLY when I do a make install and it is failing when it
uses dbpage_test_setup.exe and when it trys to create a test DB.  I don't
think I need to have any of the tests stuff created for make or make install
I just want the compiled XSP to be build and installed where I tell it.  

I am looking for how to disable this area that is failing with a
configuration option if available, or find out how to fix it. But not sure
where to go from the errors, as I have SQLite3 installed in the cygwin
environment and I can run and access SQLite in cygwin without issues.  Not
sure what it is missing as the errors don't appear specific.
