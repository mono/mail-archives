&gt;<i> But I am not shutting down your idea.  In fact, if someone is
</I>motivated
&gt;<i> enough, they can use Mono as a research platform to try out the idea,
</I>do
&gt;<i> a proof-of-concept implementation, and then they could propose this to
</I>&gt;<i> the ECMA standards body.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do not know enough about multiple-inheritance to have a strong
</I>&gt;<i> opinion, but I know people who do have a pretty strong opinion against
</I>&gt;<i> it, so you might want to address those issues as well.

Personally my feeling is that the BCL basically proves that it is
possible to build large and very usable class libraries *without* MI.  I
say this as a former MI lover (my primary previous life was with ATL
which bordered on pathological use of MI :)). Adding MI support would
significant increase the complexity of CLI execution engines for
marginal benefits so I really don't expect to ever see it supported
natively in the CLI type system.  I think generics support will turn out
to be much more enabling.

(BTW I love the word &quot;Mehrfachvererbung&quot; and am going to try to use it
in conversation soon).
