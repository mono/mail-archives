<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Yesterday I have read an ca 1 years old article about .net again.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In this magazine there stood advantages and disadvantages of C# and .net 
</I>&gt;<i> (and things, what could be better) .
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some of the things, which the magazine have listed, what could be better is, 
</I>&gt;<i> that the CIL is not compatible to C++.
</I>&gt;<i> Not all C++-programs can be compiled to the CIL. The reason is, that C++ 
</I>&gt;<i> supports &quot;Mehrfachvererbung&quot; for example - the CIL dosen't.
</I>&gt;<i> (&quot;Mehrfachvererbung&quot; is a german word. And I don't know how it is called in 
</I>&gt;<i> english. Is it called &quot;multi-heredity&quot; ?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, is it possible, that Mono integrate this features in its CIL, which 
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft haven't integrated?
</I>
Multiple-inheritance can be emulated on the CIL (C++ does this) and
Eiffel.NET found an interesting trick to implement it, so there is no
need to change the CIL.

Now, even in that case, I am more interested in remaining compatible to
the Microsoft CIL than to do our own extensions.

But I am not shutting down your idea.  In fact, if someone is motivated
enough, they can use Mono as a research platform to try out the idea, do
a proof-of-concept implementation, and then they could propose this to
the ECMA standards body.

I do not know enough about multiple-inheritance to have a strong
opinion, but I know people who do have a pretty strong opinion against
it, so you might want to address those issues as well.


&gt;<i> But for completeness, here the &quot;disadvantages&quot; of C#, which there was 
</I>&gt;<i> listed:
</I>&gt;<i> - it is not possible to get more parameters by one function back
</I>
You can use `out' parameters.

&gt;<i> - no support for definitions of pre- and postconditions and invariants.
</I>
Brian posted a link yesterday about pre-conditions using attributes
which was interesting.  It is not natively supported as Eiffel does.

Miguel
