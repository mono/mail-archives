This site came up when I searched for &quot;mscoree.dll&quot;.  Can you tell me =
what the heck mscoree.dll is?  Starting a few days ago, whenever I run =
Norton WinDoctor, I get the problem that this program file is missing, =
and cannot be repaired.  It cannot be found on my hard drive, and I have =
no idea what changed to make the file vanish.  I downloaded a &quot;PC =
Booster&quot; program that has improved my PC and Internet performance, and =
it was around this time that I started getting the WinDoctor message =
about the missing mscoree.dll file.  The only other change I made around =
this time was to open &quot;Startup&quot; in System Configuration Utility and =
uncheck all Norton-related entries to try to get LiveUpdate to stop =
running automatically.  All I know for certain is my computer is running =
BETTER now than it has ... but it bugs me that WinDoctor makes it sound =
like this file should be replaced.  Any help is much appreciated.  =
Thanks in advance.
