<PRE>There is one place where multiple-inheritance is a clear winner: when
reusing someone else's code...

Every discussion of multiple vs single only inheritance focuses on how
people can design properly their library such that they don't need
multiple inheritance.

All nice and true when you control everything but when you want to
reuses someone elses code, what do you do? Let's say I have a math
library that I have been building for a couple of years. Now I find one
on the net that someone also has a math library and it has one
functionality that I'd like to reuse. Of course that library expects its
own type of matrices and vectors. 

With multiple inheritance I can easily have a transparent bridge between
those two libraries. With single inheritance, I need a lot more work to
make it work.

That's why I'm pro-multiple inheritance. I also like the fact that you
can have pre-defined implementation for the interfaces you want to
implement.

...

But I am not shutting down your idea.  In fact, if someone is motivated
enough, they can use Mono as a research platform to try out the idea, do
a proof-of-concept implementation, and then they could propose this to
the ECMA standards body.

I do not know enough about multiple-inheritance to have a strong
opinion, but I know people who do have a pretty strong opinion against
it, so you might want to address those issues as well.
