<PRE>Hi Lluis!,

I am just another guy trying to help on the implementation of Remoting
but nothing more so I can't say if there is a 'plan', so the following
are just suggestions.

Remoting lacks of a lot of the classes and the ones already there are
mostly stubs.
Since they are in the corlib we will have to be using special tricks to
get somethings working as classes in the corlib can't access other
important and really usefull stuff as the XML classes. But Miguel
pointed me out some ways in which we can skip these problems.
You now that maybe the most important classes in Remoting are
MarshalByRefObject and ObjectHandle. The second one is mostly done and
it's being used already but the first one, the parent class for all the
marshaled by reference objects is little more than a stub and then you
can't inherit freely from it as needed for lots of the Remoting classes.

So, what can you do?. I suggest you to try to finish the
MarshalByRefObject class if you can, but this is difficult and strange
corlibs are generated. If you think that's too hard, you should try to
jump directly into mcs/class/corlib/System.Runtime.Remoting directory
and try to complete the missing stuff there, what probably will make you
to go to other classes in System.ComponentModel or
System.Runtime.Remoting.Services, etc. So first try that
MarshalByRefObject or come to the System.Runtime.Remoting space.
Currently I am trying to implement the RemotingConfiguration and
SoapServices class with priority to others as some methods as in
RemotingConfiguration are very important but implementable by me (hope).

Another thing, get as much documentation you can and... share it with me
;-).

Cheers,

Jaime.
