I've only dreamed of using *nix in my web farm application but I have a =
few needs to to contend with before I could. For one, a data provider =
that mimics SQLXML managed classes would be a huge advantage. Microsoft =
built their SQLXML managed classes using TDS and I believe I know =
approximately how they have done it. Secondly, I'd need the ability to =
write modules and handlers (and register them in web.config's would be =
nice). Also, a couple of shortcomings MS has would be nice to overcome: =
for example, impersonation is great but it the impersonated user =
requires all the permissions to allow the dynamic compilation of the =
code. This is a security risk and makes the use of impersonation =
unfeasible in many ways. It would be nicer if a section of code could be =
run in context of the logged (or specifed) user and the rest of the =
code, including the compilation, runs as the normal ASPNET system user. =
Or, maybe it would make more sense to specify which user account context =
is used when complilation is performed...
