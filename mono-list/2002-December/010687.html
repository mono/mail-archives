<PRE>Hi,

I would be interested in helping out on this, who else would like to
help out?

Steve did mention that he has list of to-do's for the compiler, if your
about Steve can you let me know what they are?

I would also be interested in hearing all your thoughts on the compiler,
possible features etc.

Cheers

Andrew

Subject: [Mono-list] Javascript and Mono

Hello,

   JavaScript is going to be an important programming language to
support.   A year ago, Steve was working on an implementation of it
called JANET.  JANET compiled Javascript code to C#, and the runs the
resulting code.

   He is unable to continue this work at this point, but has written a
lot of code, I have included his e-mail and his current snapshot of the
code to this message, hoping that someone might be interested in
completing this compiler.

   I would like to see this compiler use Reflection.Emit to generate
code because it would allow us to use it as an embeddable scripting
engine, and would allow us to implement &quot;eval&quot;.  In fact, Rachel's
MonoLOGO compiler has moved into this direction as well: the compiler is
part of the supporting runtime for the language.

Miguel
