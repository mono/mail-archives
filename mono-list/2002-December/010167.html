Hi!

I am an expert in .NET programming and have published a few articles and
books on it. I really think that the success of Mono is really important for
the success of .NET and Linux. I have worked with Java for a long time and
have found deployment glitches in it. .NET solves a lot of these problems.
On the other hand, I prefer Linux to Windows anytime. Linux is just one of
those wonderful things happened to the deployment world. If Mono is
successful, Linux sales will really go up. And MS will try hard for it not
to be successful.

So, Go-Mono !!! We need a success here.
