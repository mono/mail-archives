<PRE>Hi all,

I'm having a bit of trouble running mono with GC support enabled.  I initially 
compiled mono without the GC and started using it to learn C#.  Everything 
worked great until I decided to check out GTK#.  GTK# compiled and installed 
fine but whenever I tried to run one of the apps I got an error saying &quot;** 
ERROR **: No GCHandle support built-in&quot;.  I figured that for some reason GTK# 
required a GC enabled mono.  So I got Boehm and recompiled mono with GC 
support.  That all worked fine until I tried to run something.

I first tried to recompile mcs thinking that maybe it needed to turn some 
stuff on now that it had a GC enabled mono running underneath it.  However, 
when it tried to compile csc I got a warning from the GC saying that 
something was allocating alot of memory repeadedly (~40 meg).  My system 
quickly slowed to a crawl until the compiler exited with an out of memory 
error.

I also went ahead an tried to run one of the GTK# examples.  It didn't give me 
the error I previously had, but it did give me the error from the GC saying 
that something was allocating alot of memory repeatedly (~20 meg this time).  
That too died with an out of memory error.

Has anyone else seen this behavior before?

I went back and recompiled mono without GC support and now everything works 
fine again, except for GTK# apps which give their original error again.

My system is a PIII 866 with 512 meg of ram.  My swap partition is 512 meg as 
well.  I compiled everything with gcc 3.2.1.  I'm running the latest stable 
Gentoo.

Thanks for your help,

rob
