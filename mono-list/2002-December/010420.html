<PRE>Yesterday I have read an ca 1 years old article about .net again.

In this magazine there stood advantages and disadvantages of C# and .net 
(and things, what could be better) .

Some of the things, which the magazine have listed, what could be better is, 
that the CIL is not compatible to C++.
Not all C++-programs can be compiled to the CIL. The reason is, that C++ 
supports &quot;Mehrfachvererbung&quot; for example - the CIL dosen't.
(&quot;Mehrfachvererbung&quot; is a german word. And I don't know how it is called in 
english. Is it called &quot;multi-heredity&quot; ?)

So, is it possible, that Mono integrate this features in its CIL, which 
Microsoft haven't integrated?
I think, that is something, which makes only programs incompatible to 
MS.NET, if they use this feature. And if MS.NET have the same feature in the 
future, the existing programs written on Mono running then on MS.NET, too.



The other disadvantages, which are they have published are all refered to 
C#. But, because C# is only _one_ language for the CIL, I don't see it as so 
important as to have a CIL which can be used for all programming-languages.

But for completeness, here the &quot;disadvantages&quot; of C#, which there was 
listed:
- it is not possible to get more parameters by one function back
- no support for definitions of pre- and postconditions and invariants.
