<PRE>Salutations!

I've just downloaded the latest release of Mono, and I must say it has come
a long way since I last looked at it. Amazing!

After updating the version of my main x86 linux box, I decided to give it a
go on my iBook running Yellow Dog. The compile seemed to go well, but it
doesn't appear as if the mono JIT was built - I was wondering, is the mono
JIT done for PPC, or just x86? The status page for PPC was kind of vague -
I'm assuming that &quot;Jitter - Start the port&quot; is speaking of the JIT engine,
but I wasn't sure.

Just wondering! If you could let me know if the JIT engine for PPC is
working or not, that'd be great!

BTW, I'm completely impressed with the polish the system seems to have at
this point - you guys have done a fantastic job!!

Regards,
Bryan Porter
