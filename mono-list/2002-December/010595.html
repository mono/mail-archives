<PRE>Guess you haven't been reading the list lately...  ;-)

I re-wrote a good portion of the Switch handling and related code
(including the all-important DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler, which
actually reads the .config file).  This was committed to CVS and
announced to Mono-List on Wednesday (see message titled &quot;Got
Switches?&quot;), so it's a rather recent addition.

Good news: it works (for my tests, anyway).
Bad news: your diff doesn't have a chance of applying properly, as most
of TraceSwitch has changed.  Such is life.

I just committed unit tests for TraceSwitch, but there will be problems
with actually *running* the unit tests until somebody can tell me how to
deal with .config files from within NUnit.  See the (going nowhere)
thread &quot;Testing .config files&quot;.

&gt;<i> I was in the process of making our enhanced trace package function with Mono and I ran into TraceSwitch.  I don't think it was ever finished.  Included is a functioning TraceSwitch class which is used to determine if the trace level you're testing is greater/equal to the level of the Switch.  This is used to determine if our TraceQueue should send the trace items onto the listeners.  I didn't see any Unit Tests for TraceSwitch and it doesn't look like anybody really uses it.  But we do.  :)
