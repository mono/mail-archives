<PRE>Thanks.  That's great news.  I just signed up for the list on Thursday and have only looked at committed code.  So long as it works well (read: like the Microsoft Framework), I don't really care who's code it is.  :)  You can pretend I didn't send the patch in.

	Guess you haven't been reading the list lately...  ;-)
	
	I re-wrote a good portion of the Switch handling and related code
	(including the all-important DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler, which
	actually reads the .config file).  This was committed to CVS and
	announced to Mono-List on Wednesday (see message titled &quot;Got
	Switches?&quot;), so it's a rather recent addition.
	
	Good news: it works (for my tests, anyway).
	Bad news: your diff doesn't have a chance of applying properly, as most
	of TraceSwitch has changed.  Such is life.
	
	I just committed unit tests for TraceSwitch, but there will be problems
	with actually *running* the unit tests until somebody can tell me how to
	deal with .config files from within NUnit.  See the (going nowhere)
	thread &quot;Testing .config files&quot;.

	&gt; I was in the process of making our enhanced trace package function with Mono and I ran into TraceSwitch.  I don't think it was ever finished.  Included is a functioning TraceSwitch class which is used to determine if the trace level you're testing is greater/equal to the level of the Switch.  This is used to determine if our TraceQueue should send the trace items onto the listeners.  I didn't see any Unit Tests for TraceSwitch and it doesn't look like anybody really uses it.  But we do.  :)
