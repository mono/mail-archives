Maybe.  If you've used libraries that Mono has implemented, then it will
be portable.  If not, then it won't be portable.

The long-term Mono goal is to support all (most?) of .NET.  However,
that will take time.  Windows.Forms may be a year off before it's mostly
complete, and several of the libraries I've seen are in incomplete
states.

In short, many libraries are still being worked on, but the long-term
goal is to be compatible.

&gt;<i> Q2: in case of yes in previous question ,how can you grantee that Microsoft

</I>&gt;<i> portability between  (Mono CLI) and Microsoft CLI?
</I>
Can I guarantee that the sun will rise tomorrow?  No.  I can be
reasonably sure it will, but for all I know a Vogon Constructor Fleet
will come by this afternoon and destroy the Earth to make way for a
Hyperspace Bypass (apologies to Douglas Adams).

Backward compatibility will work against them, though.  If they change
the meaning of CIL opcodes, then existing apps will fail, which kinda
kills the whole point of .NET.

New CIL opcodes will be added, but current indications are that any
added opcodes will also be added to the ECMA and/or ISO standards, so a
major split appears to be unlikely.

But I don't claim to see the future, either.

&gt;<i> Q3:when you work in .Net Platform for Microsoft it is a most to use IIS as
</I>&gt;<i> web server, what is the status in MONO in this case and how can i port my
</I>&gt;<i> code in case MONO accept another type of web server?
</I>
I know work is ongoing for ASP.NET support, but I don't know much beyond
that.

<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/asp-net.html">http://www.go-mono.com/asp-net.html</A> might provide some additional
information.

Anyone else want to field this question?
