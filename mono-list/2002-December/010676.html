<PRE>Hi,

I don't know if anyone else is having the same problems but Win Zip
can't open the Tar file. Any chance someone can repackage the code up
for opening in Win Zip?

Thanks

Andrew

Subject: [Mono-list] Javascript and Mono

Hello,

   JavaScript is going to be an important programming language to
support.   A year ago, Steve was working on an implementation of it
called JANET.  JANET compiled Javascript code to C#, and the runs the
resulting code.

   He is unable to continue this work at this point, but has written a
lot of code, I have included his e-mail and his current snapshot of the
code to this message, hoping that someone might be interested in
completing this compiler.

   I would like to see this compiler use Reflection.Emit to generate
code because it would allow us to use it as an embeddable scripting
engine, and would allow us to implement &quot;eval&quot;.  In fact, Rachel's
MonoLOGO compiler has moved into this direction as well: the compiler is
part of the supporting runtime for the language.

Miguel
