<PRE>Hi Stifu,



&gt;<i> This is pretty vague. What kind of application would you like to make?
</I>&gt;<i> You may want to check out GTK# tutorials (but then again, I'm not even sure
</I>&gt;<i> you want to make a program with a UI)...
</I>

I want to create a C# program displaying &quot;Bible Verse of The Day&quot; in a window, each day a new verse, and to be repeated next year.  It can also work on leap year, i.e. the verse for Feb., 29. also available.


The .dat file is already prepared as follows;
0101|&quot;The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.&quot;|Psalms 121:8
0102|&quot;Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.&quot;|John 5:24
0103|&quot;I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.&quot;|Proverbs 8:17
...
...
0201|&quot;And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God.&quot;|Romans 12:2
0202|&quot;Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him...And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.&quot;|1 John 2:15,17
....
etc.


When MS Windows starts (PC) and after login the &quot;verse of the day&quot; will be displayed in a window popup in the centre of the screen.  The said window has animated background.  Church melody will play as well.

At the bottom of the window there is a &quot;Amen&quot; button on the left.  Clicking it will close the window and stop the music.  A drop list will reside on the right for selecting language.

The above is the program I expect to create.  Please shed me some light.  TIA

PS - .wav sound file and .gif background file are already available.
