My understanding is that gst-sharp is either very slow-moving or dead
altogether.  I have never seen anything more than a proof-of-concept app
that uses it.

&gt;<i> Regarding glue...  I was thinking that I could write a shared object library

Yup, that's exactly what Banshee does.  Do all the tricky pointer stuff
in C, and export a nice, clean set of functions for C# to consume.  If
you want to look at an example, look at the libbanshee sources in
Banshee.  Most of the consumption of this library is in the GStreamer
PlayerEngine.  (I forget where it is in the source tree, but &quot;find
-iname gstreamer\*.cs&quot; should locate it.)

&gt;<i> This will only be on Linux, so distributing GStreamer would be no problem. 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, we have a lot of control over the platforms that this would run

Ah, I misread your initial message.  I thought you wanted to run this on
Linux and Windows, but upon rereading it, it is actually quite clear
that you just want to *talk* to a Windows system from Linux.

Yeah, I would definitely go with GStreamer.  :)
