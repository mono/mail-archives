Hi Folks
I am a total newbie to Linux, Mono, C# and audio editing - but keen to
learn.

I have a project where I would like to display images and play an audio
file. (simple enough) 

However, I would like to pre-determine when the image should change, based
on where the playhead is currently situated within the audio file.
In effect, the application will read a database (or XML) which contains
&quot;Audio_FileName&quot;, &quot;Start_Point&quot;, &quot;End_Point&quot; and &quot;Image_Name&quot;.
As the playhead reaches &quot;End_Point&quot;, the pointer moves the the next record
in the DB/XML, changes the image and continues playing (or skips ahead to
the next &quot;Start_Point&quot; if its different)

I have this all working in my proof-of-concept tool, (once the data is in
the DB) but I am making MANY instances of the same thing, so I would like an
IDE which has both an audio editor and database on screen. 
1. Open the Audio file and select the relevant portion for the image.
2. Click a button that writes the &quot;Start_Point&quot; and &quot;End_Point&quot; to my
database.
(Inserting the start and end point by hand is REALLY laborious.)

Is this do-able in Mono / C#?
