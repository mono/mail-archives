Hello,

I moved to GNU/Linux (Ubuntu specifically) from Windows last year. I had a
very long history with MS, going back to MS-DOS 3.3 and GW Basic. I was
thrilled to discover Mono, as I really like VB, and want to learn and use
C#. What I aspire to do is to build a server application that runs as a
daemon process, that can be connected to from an Apache so module. This
server application would have to catch signals sent from the OS and start
and stop scripts and all that stuff that processes do. Also, I want to be
able to extend its functionality with external Mono code, through a basic
API of sorts.

Basicly what this application is, it's a scaled down clone of the ColdFusion
Web application server. No disrespect to ASP.NET, this being a Mono
community and all, but I also have a very long history with ColdFusion,
going back to the Allaire days when it was called dbml instead of cfml, and
I just like it. My problem with the commercial ColdFusion product right now,
its $7500 price tag (if you want to run it on more than one Web site), a
severe case of code bloat (it's a 357MB download for 32-bit, 456 for
64-bit), and increasingly pro Microsoft leanings. I only need a small subset
of the complete CF functionality. Obviously, a complete clone of the CF
server would be a massive bite to swallow.

I look forward to any input about this. Mono has a brilliant future I think,
and I'd like to use it for this.

Thanks,

Dave
