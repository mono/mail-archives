<PRE>Google has announced the projects accepted for Summer for Code 2010!

The results* are in, and this year the Mono project has been awarded
10 slots. We had many good applications and a limited number of slots,
and unfortunately had to make some hard decisions - we had many more
proposals worthy of support, and there was a lot of fighting** between
the Mono devs to narrow down the list.
Congratulations to the students who were accepted to work with the Mono Project!

If you weren't accepted, we still would like you to join our
community. We're always happy to provide guidance and support to
anyone who'd like to contribute, not just GSoC students.

This year, we have the following projects, students and mentors:

Background Code Analysis in MonoDevelop
Student: Nikhil Sarda
Mentor: Jeremie Laval
This project will bring background C# code analysis to MonoDevelop, to
highlight problems on the fly, and offer fixes using MonoDevelop's
refactoring operations.

Code Contracts Verifier
Student: Chris Bacon
Mentor: Marek Safar
This project will implement the verifier for .NET 4 Code Contracts,
and complete Mono's implementation of the Code Contracts API.

Additional C# Refactoring Operations for MonoDevelop
Student: Martinho Fernandes
Mentor: Mike Krueger
This project will increase the number of C# refactoring operations in
MonoDevelop, including improved extract method, extract
interface/superclass, change method signature, and many more.

F# Language Binding for MonoDevelop
Student: Victor Milovanov
Mentor: Lluis Sanchez
This project will improve the nascent F# support in MonoDevelop,
focusing on more advanced features such as the code completion parser.

Safe Points and Precise Scanning of Locals for SGen
Student: Sanjoy Das
Mentor: Mark Probst
This project will add safe points to Mono's new SGen GC, which are a
prerequisite of several useful GC features and optimizations.

Managed Interop with Native C++ Libraries
Student: Alexander Corrado
Mentor: Andreia Gaita
This project will improved C++ interop mechanisms for managed code,
including direct invocation without C glue.

MonoDevelop Class Designer
Student: Evan Briones
Mentor: Michael Hutchinson
This project will create a class designer for MonoDevelop based on a
re-usable Moonlight canvas.

GTK# Data Binding Library with Stetic Support
Student: Krzysztof Marecki
Mentor: Mike Kestner
This project will focus on improving MonoDevelop's &quot;Stetic&quot; GTK# designer.

Regex-to-IL Compiler
Student: C.J. Adams-Collier
Mentor: Rodrigo Kumpera
This project will complete Mono's Regex-to-IL compiler, allowing
regexes to be JIT-compiled.

Mono.UPnP
Student: Yavor Georgiev
Mentor: Scott Peterson
This project will complete the Mono.UPnP library, for media sharing
between devices and applications such as Banshee and F-Spot.


We are now in the community bonding period, which means it's time to
get to know your mentors, get comfortable with any tools you're going
to need to use on the project, refine your project goals and scope,
and do any setup required to get ready for coding.

Things to do at this time:

- subscribe to the mono-soc mailing list -
<A HREF="http://groups.google.com/group/mono-soc-2010">http://groups.google.com/group/mono-soc-2010</A>
- if you haven't yet, join us on irc.gimpnet.org, the SoC-specific
channel is #monosoc
- get excited!

We look forward to working with these students this summer, and hope
for a very successful Summer of Code!
