<PRE>Hi Stifu,


&gt;<i> Why would you need to create 2 programs, and where does the .dat file
</I>&gt;<i> come into the equation? It'd still be one single program, whether there
</I>&gt;<i> is a .dat file or not.
</I>
Because some users are running Windows and others Linux.  Therefore I need 2 programs serving them for the time being.  The .dat file is the same for both systems.  It has been created and is working.


Regarding Java if an program needs JRE (Java Runtime Environment) and it can't find it on Windows during execution, it'll ask permission to download it on Internet and install it on Windows as well.  Only ONCE.   Should my recollection is correct.  I don't run Windows often only for testing.  If I'm wrong please correct me.  Thanks.

Will GTK# be the same?


Other advice noted and thanks


B.R.

</I>Most Windows installation don't have GTK# installed, but you could make an
installer package that handles this (check if GTK# is already installed, and
which version, in order to determine whether to install it or not). Look
around for such solutions.
That's why I mentioned Windows.Forms earlier, because with it, you wouldn't
need any extra installation on Windows, just the .NET framework. The
downside is that there is no WinForms designer in MonoDevelop, so you'd
either need to code all the UI code manually with no designer, or make the
UI on Windows.

By the way, Java would work fine. But you'd need to use Swing (for the UI)
if you don't want to install anything other than Java. But then again,
whether you use Java or .NET, the Java or .NET framework is also required on
the user computer, and you should probably ensure it is there in your
installer. So whether you need to add an extra installation (like GTK#)
shouldn't be a problem, since you'll need a smart installer anyway.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I guess you might need gtk-sharp2, but you could simply try to make a GTK#
app in MonoDevelop, and see if it complains about anything missing. That way
you'd know for sure, it only takes a few seconds.
