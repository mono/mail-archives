<PRE>
So I've been studying and reading up on Mono, and in the course of this I
came upon articles saying that Mono should be quarantined from Gnome, its
not free software etc. But in reading these articles, I'm having a hard time
seeing the core issues clearly. So far what I gather is that Microsoft holds
patents  on some of the .NET libraries related to ASP, ADO etc. The argument
being that at some point in time, if many OSS projects use these, MS could
pull the rug out from under them by demanding royalties. Yet I also read
that some of it is not threatened by these patents.

So I've heard arguments that these patents aren't a really big deal, but I
understand people's hesitation about that. But isn't all the core
functionality of Mono, these libraries aside, TOTALLY based on free
software? In other words don't we have a cool system here for OSS
development even if Microsoft goes its way and .NET and Mono are no longer
compatible?

And if that is correct, how can I show to people exactly what that totally
free part of Mono is? The FUD is so vague, I get the impression that the
entirety of this project is patented by Microsoft, but when I look for
details I'm not seeing it. Is there some way I can show people that this
isn't the case? 

HELP ME STOP THE FUD! :)
