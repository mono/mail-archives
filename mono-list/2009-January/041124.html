<PRE>Robert,

Thank you.

&gt;<i> You forgot the platform, but I guess it's Vista.
</I>
Yes. You can see it from posted log file: Windows NT 6.0

 &gt; Why don't you use a more common platform? Or at least stick
&gt;<i> with something that it supposed to work under Windows, like XSP.
</I>&gt;<i> That beast is perfectly suitable for testing an ASP.NET application
</I>&gt;<i> on Windows before deploying it on Linux.
</I>
Some of customers have windows servers.
If some servers are using IIS  and some are using Mono I need to support two
different platforms.

So my idea is to use single platform, Mono in all servers.

Is this reasonable or should I learn and use IIS+.NET  in Windows?

I got the following reply from windows mod_mono  author, Angel Marin:

&quot;mod_mono binary is not updated to run with mono svn. I'm surprised that
it even works, mod_mono protocol is bound to particular mono releases.
You'll probably need a binary that matches the svn revision of your mono
build.

Webservices have had issues when going through mod_mono on windows,
though not sure if they work reliably now, haven't tested them lately&quot;

Will Apache+mod_mono run OK in older windwses than Vista ?

Is it reasonable to use XSP instead mod_mono to run asmx web service in
Windows production servers ?
Can you make mod_mono in SVN to compile for Windows also by including 
Angel's patch ?

Which is the stable configuration to run Mono asmx web service in
windows in production server ?

Andrus. 

</PRE>
