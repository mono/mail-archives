Excellent response by Adam. This sort of thing (FUD) occurs on a grand scale
on the net, and within companies as well. Ultimately I put my faith in
Darwinism. In other words, a technology or project will survive based on its
merits.  Rather than burn energy fighting FUD, spend it on code and
documentation.

Also found this post vaguely relevant and inspirational:

With regards to the specifics of patents, anything included  in the ECMA is
100% safe. Anything not in ECMA is subject to speculation (and FUD).   I
believe that's Windows.Forms and ADO.NET. But at this point in the evolution
of the industry its a moot issue.  In other words, from a practical
perspective any mono classes are safe.  

If at some point in the future commercial libraries are built on top of
mono,  I'll gladly buy a license, simply because its the most productive
stack I've ever used.
