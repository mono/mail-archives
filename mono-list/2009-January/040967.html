<PRE>Uh oh, I feel like this is turning into a Java vs. DotNet culture debate
here, and I really don't care enough about either side to get into that. All
I'm saying is that I like the way Java lets you directly access a generic
class without refering to the type in it. Don't like my example? Fine, make
it static Mug.MugsInUse, which is incremented each time a constructor is
called. Unlike topology, that would change. My point is the same. Now could
that be done another way? Sure. I could have a MugInUse counter class or
whatever. At a technical level, it doesn't matter, it would work as well,
there are a million ways to make it work. Its about what's intuitive, what
sits easy in the mind. And what sits easy in my mind is that, a List is a
List whether its of groceries or things to do, and a Mug is a Mug whether it
has Cocoa in it or Coffee. And I should be able to refer to a List or Mug as
an entity regardless of what they contain.
But whatever, this is just my observation. And I'm pretty new to DotNet, I
may yet &quot;see the light&quot;. Give me 6 months of getting used to DotNet and if I
still see things the same way, I'll come back and we'll have a real debate
on it. :)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more intuitive to program in. The reason is that I think of Generics as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something that are &quot;contained&quot; in a class, while being separate of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; class. So something like:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mug&lt;Cocoa&gt; yourdrink = new Mug&lt;Cocoa&gt;();
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mug&lt;Coffee&gt; mydrink = new Mug&lt;Coffee&gt;();
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mug.topology = Doughnut;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; makes more sense, I the general shape of all Mugs shouldn't be dependent
</I>&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what liquid they contain. I can see the value of the dotnet approach too,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but its just simply less intuitive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I disagree entirely, and I was a Java developer long before I learned
</I>&gt;<i> C#.  I find the Java system incredible mind-bending and the only
</I>&gt;<i> difficulty I had transitioning to the .NET model of generics was
</I>&gt;<i> unlearning the Java model (which was a joy).  There is nothing worse
</I>&gt;<i> than enforcing the use of .equals and friends over what should
</I>&gt;<i> effectively be primitive types, but are actually objects.  And, of
</I>&gt;<i> course, there's the memory footprint you create by boxing primitives
</I>&gt;<i> for no good reason.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What you're specifying there, by the way, actually doesn't even make
</I>&gt;<i> sense since data like that would be better exposed in a property (or
</I>&gt;<i> getter method, if we're talking Java) since it's not something you
</I>&gt;<i> would expect to be able to set about all Mugs that exist in an
</I>&gt;<i> application all at once.
