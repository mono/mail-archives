<PRE>Hi,

.NET Framework is just a part of Windows so it makes sense to have a 
Windows port of Mono. This also helps making Mono more platform independent.

You may also find useful to test your applications on Windows with Mono 
even if you target Linux because it is very similar to the Linux port.

On the other hand you even can embed Mono to your application and take 
advantage of being able to strip unneeded parts to shrink the deployment 
size.
