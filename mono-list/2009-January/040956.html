This is in reference to comparing C# and C++ for Game Engine/Game Programming
and while this is not all about Mono, it does have some questions about it
that you guys might be able to answer.

I know this has probably been argued to death but I am just starting to get
back interested in want to learn game programming again(been doing a lot of
web development) so I am not sure if the agreeument has changed at all.  A
few years ago, that main thing people said against C# was the speed lost you
occur for using it and the requirement on the .NET framework(or Mono Runtime
libraries in using Mono).  

For the runtime requirements:
Now from what I understand, Window updater included updates to the .NET
Framework and basically Microsoft is integrating the .NET framework into all
of their applications so if the requirement on the .NET Framework really
that big of a deal anymore?

For the speed degrade:
How big is this really?  I am not looking to build the next Unreal Engine or
a game engine that will power the next PC version of GTA, I would be happy
with a game engine that would be able to produce graphics like we would have
seen in the Mythos game if it was ever finished(for screen shots, take a
look here: <A HREF="http://media.pc.ign.com/media/869/869458/imgs_1.html">http://media.pc.ign.com/media/869/869458/imgs_1.html</A>).  Now I
know I am going to have to battle my technical skills to get something like
that and I improve my skill but I don't want to have to battle the
language(that is something I cannot improve).  So are those quality of
graphics possible with a complete C# Game Engine(and possible use of C++/ASM
.dll files for stuff like math and physics and what not) while still getting
a good frame rate?  Also from what I hear (correct me if I am wrong) more
and more code for graphics are being pushed to the graphics card itself so
that seems like it would also help with the speed issue.  Also is using
Mono/Tao Framework vs. .NET/XNA add even more to the performance loss to the
equation?

Another thing I am also curious about is portability.  Now I know if I use
C# with .NET and XNA, I will be limited to Windows/Xbox 360.  I also know
that if I used Mono/Tao Framework instead, that should work on
Windows/Linux/MacOS.  Do you think that any of these technologies are going
to become compatible with PS3/Wii/Future Consoles because if there is no
chance that C# with .NET/XNA or Mono/Tao Framework will work on
consoles(besides .NET/XNA working on Xbox 360) that would also be something
for me to consider as I except all platform and console to continue to
support C++ for a while.
Answers to these questions or links to articles that are recent(no older
than 6 months) that answer these questions would be great.  Thanks.
