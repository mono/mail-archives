<PRE>Huh. Yeah, I don't really know the history of Generics in each language. I'm
assuming there's value in the .NET model, but I still find the Java model
more intuitive to program in. The reason is that I think of Generics as
something that are &quot;contained&quot; in a class, while being separate of the
class. So something like:
Mug&lt;Cocoa&gt; yourdrink = new Mug&lt;Cocoa&gt;();
Mug&lt;Coffee&gt; mydrink = new Mug&lt;Coffee&gt;();
Mug.topology = Doughnut;
makes more sense, I the general shape of all Mugs shouldn't be dependent on
what liquid they contain. I can see the value of the dotnet approach too,
but its just simply less intuitive.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Type erasure enables Java applications that use generics to maintain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; binary compatibility with Java libraries and applications that were
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; created before generics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is, they failed.  The _original_ intent, as I remember it

</I>&gt;<i> used by the Java 1.4 development chain, i.e. you could use generic
</I>&gt;<i> classes from a non-generic runtime, etc.  Had this *actually* been the
</I>&gt;<i> case, the tradeoffs would likely have been acceptable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alas, that is not the case; they had to change class file format anyway,
</I>&gt;<i> thus preventing 1.5 .class files from being loaded into a 1.4 runtime.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, back in 1999 there were Java generic efforts that mirrored
</I>&gt;<i> what .NET has -- actual distinct generic types, the use of value types
</I>&gt;<i> within the generic system (so you could have an ArrayList&lt;int&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> implemented atop an int[] as opposed to the Java 1.5 List&lt;Integer&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> implemented atop an Object[]).  It was rejected because...it introduced
</I>&gt;<i> incompatible changes to the runtime (shock!  horror!).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That might be why it feels more &quot;natural&quot; to me than the .NET stuff,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just because I have a long history with Java. You're probably right on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the .NET system being better in the long run, it was designed at a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time when they could take all the lessons and mistakes of Java into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; account...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That can't be entirely true, either.  Java 1.5 was released in September
</I>&gt;<i> 2004, while .NET 2.0 was released in November 2005.  14 months is not
</I>&gt;<i> enough time to get feedback from the Java release and introduce any
</I>&gt;<i> major changes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For that matter, I know that MSR was looking into generics *before* .NET
</I>&gt;<i> 1.0 was released (and found a few semantics issues in the BCL because of
</I>&gt;<i> it that were subsequently fixed), so it really doesn't make sense to
</I>&gt;<i> state that .NET was building off of Java's failures.  The issues with
</I>&gt;<i> erasure were known well before Java 1.5 was released; Sun was just
</I>&gt;<i> willing to live with those restrictions.
