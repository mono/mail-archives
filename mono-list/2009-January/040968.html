I can see that side of things.  I'm just more of a technical person,
so seeing List&lt;T&gt; as a &quot;blueprint&quot; type and List&lt;string&gt; as a concrete
type using that blueprint seems intuitive to me.  Then it naturally
follows that List&lt;string&gt;.StaticMember and List&lt;object&gt;.StaticMember
are different properties.

It's probably more of a &quot;how your brain works&quot; thing than an actual
design advantage for either framework.
