By the way, it seems the forums don't work at all with Konqueror (you can see
threads, but when you enter one, you can't see any content, it's all empty).
This is with Kubuntu 8.10, by the way. That's too bad, as Mono itself is an
alternative .NET for alternative OSes, so you'd expect the site and forums
to work on alternative browsers, too. And Miguel keeps on saying he loves
Linux, which is why he started Mono and all... So it could be good to make
the forums work with Konqueror, which is a relatively popular Linux browser,
otherwise, it looks bad on Mono and may discourage some potential Mono
enthousiasts.

By the way, it could be a Konqueror bug, but I don't think so, because these
forums are usually glitchy for me with Firefox, and the way the content is
displayed keeps on changing randomly. I know they're actually mailing lists
in disguise, but still, I guess something could be done... I would gladly
help (or try to), but I don't think I'd be given the keys to the forums just
like that, naturally.
