<PRE>Hi, 

I'm designing a program, but I need to get the XML bit correct first -
and it's down to the software having to be run on boxes which have no
database software on... 

The problem is this. I have a blank XML design which contains all of the
fields that I need, but it is for a single entity (in this case, student
records). I will need to create a configuration file for each class I
take that has (say) 30 copies of the blank in. This isn't much of a
problem to be honest, open a new stream, copy the bits I need as many
times as I need and close the stream - works fine under C++, should work
fine under C#. 

Now the likes of attendance need to be updated maybe 4 times a week.
Rather than add in every session statically, I'd rather add each in
dynamically (add attendance from a menu, it updates the XML file with
that day and registers in, abs, auth_abs, ill etc), so the XML file is
updated with not only this data, but also have something like 

&lt;date&gt;23rd Jan 2008&lt;/date&gt; 
&lt;record&gt;in&lt;/record&gt; 

inserted at the correct place in the XML (the next date will then go
under this and so on and so on and so on - in effect, the XML file will
increase in size, but act as a text based database system). 

How would I go about doing this? 

TTFN 

Paul
