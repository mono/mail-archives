If what you are saying is that you will be writing a C# game on Linux,
compiling using mcs/gmcs, and distributing the resulting binary, then
there are no restrictions on the distribution of that binary since
it's not actually linked against Mono at all.  You only have to worry
about the LGPL if you are writing some other app, say in C, where you
embed the Mono runtime.
