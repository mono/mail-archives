<PRE>Hi,

If you are sure that this is the case you should file a bug report 
because this could easily be solved in the runtime.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suspect that you've hit a misfeature that exists for most 
</I>&gt;<i> floating-point code on 32-bit x86 Linux. It goes like this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The 32-bit floating-point registers (the &quot;x87 registers&quot;) are 
</I>&gt;<i> quite large, 80 bits long. This allows more precision than 
</I>&gt;<i> conventional &quot;double&quot; variables, which are 64 bits. There's a 
</I>&gt;<i> control register for setting what precision the processor should 
</I>&gt;<i> evaluate to, which has options of 32 bits (&quot;float&quot;), 64 bits 
</I>&gt;<i> (&quot;double&quot;) or 80 bits (&quot;long double&quot;). The idea was that you set 
</I>&gt;<i> up the precision you wanted to use, and that lower precision was 
</I>&gt;<i> faster. The power-up default is 80 bits, and Linux doesn't change 
</I>&gt;<i> that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, lower precision is not faster any more. With tens of 
</I>&gt;<i> millions of transistors available, rather than tens of thousands, 
</I>&gt;<i> chip designers can use different floating-point methods that are 
</I>&gt;<i> much faster. So using 80bit precision is obviously the right 
</I>&gt;<i> thing to do? Well, no. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You see, doubles in memory are 64 bits. And if you use 80 bit 
</I>&gt;<i> precision in the floating point processor, that means that when 
</I>&gt;<i> intermediate values get saved out to memory, they get rounded off 
</I>&gt;<i> to 64 bits, and then extended back to 80 bits when they're re-
</I>&gt;<i> loaded. And those extension bits won't be the same as the ones 
</I>&gt;<i> that were discarded. Sadly, this is the way that floating point 
</I>&gt;<i> behaves by default on 32-bit x86 Linux. It introduces some noise 
</I>&gt;<i> into the results; one can't so much say that they are wrong, as
</I>&gt;<i> that they aren't quite consistent with other platforms that use
</I>&gt;<i> 64 bits consistently throughout the calculation process. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sparcs, PowerPCs, ARMs, and 64-bit x86 use 64-bit floating-point 
</I>&gt;<i> consistently. 32-bit Windows used to do floating-point the same
</I>&gt;<i> way as 32-bit Linux does, but they changed it, so that when a 
</I>&gt;<i> Windows program starts up, the floating point has been set up to 
</I>&gt;<i> do 64 bits throughout. That's much more consistent with other 
</I>&gt;<i> platforms, and is an interesting instance of MS doing something 
</I>&gt;<i> arguably &quot;right even though awkward&quot; instead of &quot;consistent with 
</I>&gt;<i> past errors&quot;. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But why not change it to whatever you need? Well, changing the 
</I>&gt;<i> floating point precision is Very Slow on modern processors. You
</I>&gt;<i> have to completely flush the pipeline at minimum. It's much easier 
</I>&gt;<i> for it to be set at program start-up, and used consistently after
</I>&gt;<i> that. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To get this to work right in Mono, you need to write a small C 
</I>&gt;<i> function, and call it with P/Invoke on Linux. That means your 
</I>&gt;<i> program won't be pure .NET code anymore; how to best cope with 
</I>&gt;<i> that depends on your program.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The code to be run in the C function is:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> #include &lt;fpu_control.h&gt;    /* Mask the Denormal, Underflow and Inexact
</I>&gt;<i> exceptions,
</I>&gt;<i>         				leaving Invalid, Overflow and
</I>&gt;<i> Zero-divide active.
</I>&gt;<i> 				      Set precision to standard doubles,
</I>&gt;<i> and round-to-nearest. */    
</I>&gt;<i> fpu_control_t desired = _FPU_MASK_DM | _FPU_MASK_UM | _FPU_MASK_PM |
</I>&gt;<i> _FPU_DOUBLE | _FPU_RC_NEAREST ;    
</I>&gt;<i> _FPU_SETCW( desired);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This needs to be a C function because everything in uppercase in 
</I>&gt;<i> that code is a macro, from fpu_control.h. You may want to leave out 
</I>&gt;<i> enabling floating point traps, in which case the code becomes:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> #include &lt;fpu_control.h&gt;    /* Set precision to standard doubles, and
</I>&gt;<i> round-to-nearest. */    
</I>&gt;<i> fpu_control_t desired =	_FPU_DOUBLE | _FPU_RC_NEAREST ;    
</I>&gt;<i> _FPU_SETCW( desired);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would be good, really, if Mono had a standard call for setting 
</I>&gt;<i> up consistent floating-point on all its platforms. 
</I>&gt;<i>
