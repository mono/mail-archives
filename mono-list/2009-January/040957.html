Indeed.

</I>
I ran an F# version of the SciMark2 benchmark and found that Mono is 3x slower 
than .NET.

</I>
I expect you can achieve those graphics from C#/Mono alone at an acceptable 
frame rate. Don't forget that dropping to C++ can slow code down because the 
FFI has a cost.

&gt;<i> Also from what I hear (correct me if I am wrong) more and more code 
</I>&gt;<i> for graphics are being pushed to the graphics card itself so that seems
</I>&gt;<i> like it would also help with the speed issue.
</I>
Yes. You can probably push most of the computation onto the GPU today.
