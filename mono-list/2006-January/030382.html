<PRE>I am beginning to dive inside Remoting and I have read the following
sentence in a .NET book:

&gt;<i> Web services are requested much like a web page over an HTTP channel. This allows web-service requests to cross most firewalls. Of course, the same is possible with Remoting, as long as you configure your component accordingly.
</I>
However, this leads me to a new doubt: if I want to deploy a
Remoting-powered solution that bypasses most firewalls, I have to
install my application in port 80, and use and HttpChannel (although
this last requisite is not necessary I think), right? But does this
require that my application must monopolize the http port? I mean: can I
have a server with Apache running and with my Remoting application
running in port 80 at the same time? If this is possible, I suppose that
I must use some kind of redirection from Apache invokations that request
the specific URI of my remote singleton object, like mod_mono does with
XSP (AFAIK), so: is this possible right now or there should be a new
implementation of a special module for Apache, similar to mod_mono? BTW:
is this possible with IIS?

Any comments would be really appreciated.
