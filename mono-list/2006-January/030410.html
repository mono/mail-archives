On the search daemon, the main problems I've had have been when memory or file
descriptors become exhausted. If you can avoid that, and don't trip any runtime
bugs ;) it seems steady as a rock and will run for hours, days, or a couple months.

In some places we've had memory leak problems under Mono but I suspect these are
from bugs in the dotlucene port's handling of index updates. (It's known to have
some such problems.) Since I only seem to be able to reproduce it after several
hours under Wikipedia's load level it was hard to debug and I've just put off
the live index updates feature...

A more minor issue is that setting up for standard Unix-style daemon operation
seems tricky. There is a runner for 'services', but it's not well documented.
For the moment we use a hacky little shell script and a PID file which usually
works for basic start/stop/restart behavior where you don't need a clean shutdown.
