</I>OK people, here's the best I can do for the moment.

The attached script works to the extent that it reliably starts xsp, 
unreliably shuts it down and makes a right royal mess of most of the 
other things its supposed to do.  I'm most concerned about the stop 
functionality: it's really ugly, and flakey as well.  However, I just 
don't have any more time to spend on this.  Sorry.

The thing that puzzles me most is the probe functionality - in 
particular why it should start xsp after having printed the &quot;not 
supported&quot; message.  In fact, if you simply call the script without a 
parameter, it still starts (or tries to start) xsp.  I can't for the 
life of me figure out why.  But then again, as is abundantly clear from 
the script, I'm not an expert at shell scripting.

Having said that, I copied the script to /etc/init.d and called insserv 
on it and then restarted my machine.  xsp starts up just fine and is 
registered in YAST2 (i.e. YAST2 sees it and reports correctly on its 
status).  And pointing Firefox at localhost:8080 brings up the test 
application(s).

Sorry I can't come up with a better script.  If anyone else can, I'd be 
very grateful...

Cheers


Peter
