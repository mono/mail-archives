<PRE>Hi Clark,
first of all: thank you for the comments. 

&gt;<i> 1.  The program name (first field on the first step) , won't let you
</I>&gt;<i> have spaces etc (looks like it's used for the file name or something).
</I>&gt;<i>  This wasn't clear and so it wasn't working for me, so I ran it from
</I>&gt;<i> the command line and saw the error output that helped me come to this
</I>&gt;<i> conclusion.  Perhaps better validation is in order?
</I>
Of course. I'm working on it to check every fields.

&gt;<i> 1.  Selecting where to put the deb would be nice.  It's not obvious
</I>&gt;<i> that I should look in my home folder.
</I>
This is in the &quot;TODO List&quot;...

&gt;<i> 2.  The writing on the top should say &quot;steps&quot; not &quot;step&quot; (I know that
</I>&gt;<i> is nitpicky)
</I>
You are right. I'm italian, so writing in english is not so &quot;natural&quot; for me.

&gt;<i> 3.  In a future version it would be cool if you could simplify the
</I>&gt;<i> application requirement step since I have no idea what to put there as
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know how to create debs (I figure you kind of want this for
</I>&gt;<i> people who don't need to know that).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I would like to link my application directly to the assembly of a project or
the main file of a MonoDevelop solution, so the requirement should be compiled
automatically...

&gt;<i> I know you said it basically your program to learn mono so my comments
</I>&gt;<i> are probably pretty dumb but I know I will want feedback on my
</I>&gt;<i> application so I hoped it would be helpful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Ok, my applciations are developed to learn mono and basically for a personal
use, but I like to share my experience with other mono developer ...

&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Clark
</I>
Bye,
Salvatore

</PRE>
