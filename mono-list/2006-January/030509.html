I don't see any SIGTERM handlers in the runtime, so I doubt finally
blocks will be executed if you hit C-c.

&gt;<i> On a different note, I'm looking for a way to release system wide

</I>&gt;<i> state&quot; is there a way to release it?  I thought I read Mono used a

</I>
There used to be a daemon managing shared handles, but we removed that.
These days, named mutexes are released by a mono process when it exits
normally.  If a process crashes or is killed it will leave named mutexes
locked, but a new process will clean up the old named mutex when it
tries to open it again (there is a 60 second window where the old named
mutex will still be considered &quot;alive&quot; though.)

I've just realised there is a bug here, in that if a process is already
waiting for the named mutex when the process holding it terminates
prematurely, then the wait will not finish.  I'll look at that now.
