Very interesting. I did something similar when I first started learning
about .net and web services when (1.0) beta2 was released (seems a long
time ago).

This was an XKMS (1.0) client and server, where the server had
everything to create x.509 certificates, CRLs and OCSP responses. The
client/server couldn't be open-sourced (for contractual reasons) but
updated versions of the most basic stuff (ASN.1 and x.509 certificates)
are available in Mono.Security.dll.

IMHO it depends on your definition of success ;-)

Very few PKI implementation projects succeed (and those that succeed
generally never talk about the PKI stuff used internally). This
translates to lack of &quot;user/CA base&quot; success for *any* CA
implementation. So if you're looking to create a &quot;big&quot; user/CA base then
you may be disappointed.

I can suggest a few things if you want to create a &quot;generic&quot; CA
software/tools

        * don't try to do everything at once - there's too much to cover
        and that will only frustrate people needing the half-implemented
        features;
        
        * when you do something do it right - from a usability point of
        view. Creating certificates is easy but, mostly, worthless if
        you don't publish them and support a revocation mechanism;
        
        * try to make your first version &quot;works&quot; (interop) with some
        existing software (e.g. provide a &quot;template&quot; to create SSL
        server certificates). That's usable and can be used by
        &quot;normal&quot; (non X.509 versed) people to get immediate
        results/feedback. Add more scenarios later (e.g. S/MIME
        certificates, SSL client certificates, VPN...). This also
        affects how you'll publish (web, ldap...) your certificates and
        how you'll revoke them (crl, ocsp...)

Of course you can also &quot;hide the PKI&quot; and decide to offer some security
services on top of PKI technologies - as some people now fear the PKI
acronym ;-)

Have fun!
