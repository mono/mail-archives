<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1)  Using Solaris' tar will lead to failed builds due to a rules problem
</I>&gt;<i> in jay.  A work around was eventually found in an old mailing list
</I>&gt;<i> reference to this problem.  The work around suggested using cpio, pax,
</I>&gt;<i> or GNU's tar to &quot;untar&quot; the file.  It would have been helpful to have a
</I>&gt;<i> mention of this on the web site or in the README file.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2)  Do not use any of Sun's tools for the build.  configure may find
</I>&gt;<i> some of Sun's tools when run.  However, I had compilation problems when
</I>&gt;<i> they were used.  Instead, using gmake for make, and CC=gcc within the
</I>&gt;<i> CFLAGS will provide a better chance of a successful build.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3)  The generated Makefile had an incorrect INSTALL variable.  &quot;gmake
</I>&gt;<i> install&quot; was failing because the INSTALL was set to ./install-sh.  The
</I>&gt;<i> script goes into numerous sub directories where install-sh does not
</I>&gt;<i> exist.  I had to edit Makefile to set the correct path to install-sh.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note, I'm not sure if there was a problem during the run of configure or
</I>&gt;<i> something in my setup, but this was something I wanted to report just in
</I>&gt;<i> case.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4)  This problem is not related to build/installation, but I thought
</I>&gt;<i> someone may want to take a look at it, as it *does not* occur when Vault
</I>&gt;<i> is run on Linux (installed by use of binaries).  When the Vault command
</I>&gt;<i> line client is called, the following error occurs:
</I>
Thanks for these notes, I have included some of these in the README and
also in:
