<PRE>Hello, Sebastien!

At last i've received good answer on my question! Big thanks to you!

SP&gt; Very interesting. I did something similar when I first started learning
SP&gt; about .net and web services when (1.0) beta2 was released (seems a long
SP&gt; time ago).

SP&gt; This was an XKMS (1.0) client and server, where the server had
SP&gt; everything to create x.509 certificates, CRLs and OCSP responses. The
SP&gt; client/server couldn't be open-sourced (for contractual reasons) but
SP&gt; updated versions of the most basic stuff (ASN.1 and x.509 certificates)
SP&gt; are available in Mono.Security.dll.

Yes, i've already practised with Mono X509Certificate and
X509CertificateBuilder, it seems easy to create and parse certificates
with this classes. But there aren't classes for PKCS#10 Certificate
Request and requests are in use in many CA's. It would be great to
have classes like CertificateRequest, CertificateRequestCollection and
CertificateRequestBuilder. I quess, i will have to compensate this lack of
functionality.


&gt;&gt;<i> How do you think is there any future of this project. Your notes and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opinion about this project is very important to me.
</I>
SP&gt; IMHO it depends on your definition of success ;-)

SP&gt; Very few PKI implementation projects succeed (and those that succeed
SP&gt; generally never talk about the PKI stuff used internally). This
SP&gt; translates to lack of &quot;user/CA base&quot; success for *any* CA
SP&gt; implementation. So if you're looking to create a &quot;big&quot; user/CA base then
SP&gt; you may be disappointed.


SP&gt; I can suggest a few things if you want to create a &quot;generic&quot; CA
SP&gt; software/tools

SP&gt;         * don't try to do everything at once - there's too much to cover
SP&gt;         and that will only frustrate people needing the half-implemented
SP&gt;         features;

Yes, i thought about that, i agree.
        
SP&gt;         * when you do something do it right - from a usability point of
SP&gt;         view. Creating certificates is easy but, mostly, worthless if
SP&gt;         you don't publish them and support a revocation mechanism;

Yes, yes of course.
        
SP&gt;         * try to make your first version &quot;works&quot; (interop) with some
SP&gt;         existing software (e.g. provide a &quot;template&quot; to create SSL
SP&gt;         server certificates). That's usable and can be used by
SP&gt;         &quot;normal&quot; (non X.509 versed) people to get immediate
SP&gt;         results/feedback. Add more scenarios later (e.g. S/MIME
SP&gt;         certificates, SSL client certificates, VPN...). This also
SP&gt;         affects how you'll publish (web, ldap...) your certificates and
SP&gt;         how you'll revoke them (crl, ocsp...)

Interesting, i'll take it into account.

SP&gt; Of course you can also &quot;hide the PKI&quot; and decide to offer some security
SP&gt; services on top of PKI technologies - as some people now fear the PKI
SP&gt; acronym ;-)

SP&gt; Have fun!

Your advices are very helpful! Thanks!

Oleg
