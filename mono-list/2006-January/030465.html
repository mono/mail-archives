<PRE>What should i use to connect to a MySql server? I'm making an aplication
which i intend to distribute (not personal use).

There seems to be ByteFX.
The problem is that, the last time i tried to use it, it completely
failed to connect to the server (mono 1.1.11 in Suse). I was even
starting to doubt the server was really accepting conections until i
tried the MySql's Connector/Net for Ms.NET, which worked.

Now, i'm on another system with mono 1.1.13 and, this time, ByteFX seems
to be working but i don't know if i should trust it to work on all of my
intended users's systems (most of them probably Windows).
On the other hand, MySql's Connector/Net for Ms.NET is the
&#171;continuation&#187; of ByteFX but i'm not completely sure if i should trust
MySql's Connector/Net for Ms.NET since it may have problems working with
mono.

Reggie, I understand you actually brought Connector/Net with you when
joining MySQL AB?

Reggie: Yes. I developed the original ByteFX connector, which was
acquired by MySQL in April '04. It was renamed to Connector/Net,
...&quot;

Can anyone give some insight on this?
Sorry if this is asked alot but i don't find usefull information
regarding this.
