<PRE>Hi Folks

I'm running fedoracore 4 on a acer aspire 3610 laptop I have an 80 GB 
harddrive. ? how do i partition the cpanel scheme.

The following partition scheme is recommended:



NOTE: Different partition schemes are suitable for different types of 
hosting. Some servers may require space to be allocated in different ways 
than others. This recommended scheme is an attempt to provide enough space 
for many different types of hosting but it is no substitution for real world 
experience. This partition scheme may need to be varied to suit the needs of 
your specific setup.



/boot   35 Megabytes (Mb)

/usr     4096+ Mb (If you have a 60 gig drive try 6144 for /usr, 8192 if you 
have an 80 gig drive, etc.)

/var     1500+ Mb

/tmp    512+ Mb

/           1024 Mb

/home  grow to fill disk

swap    2x memory size



NOTE: The &quot;/tmp&quot; directory is a special directory that is required to be 
writeable by all users and processes on the system. In general, directories 
that are writable by all users and processes are cause for security concern, 
however this directory is a special case. To minimize any security impact as 
a result of having an unsecured &quot;/tmp&quot; directory, it is recommended that 
&quot;/tmp&quot; be mounted on a seperate partition in order to take advantage of the 
&quot;no exec&quot; option available under both Linux and FreeBSD. If a separate mount 
point exists for &quot;/tmp&quot;, then the installer will verify and potentially 
remount the partition with the &quot;no exec&quot; option. Additionally, the installer 
will ensure that the sticky bit is set on the directory and that the other 
permissions are correct. If &quot;/tmp&quot; is not mounted on a separate partition, 
the installer will create a file system disk image of 512 Mb and mount 
&quot;/tmp&quot; on the newly created disk image with the &quot;no exec&quot; directive. Under 
most circumstances, 512 Mb is sufficient for the &quot;/tmp&quot; partition; however, 
your system may require additional space. It is therefore recommended that 
you include a separate partition for the &quot;/tmp&quot; mount point (sized according 
to your size specification) prior to installing cPanel.

I'm setting up a small webhosting / ISP Business

if someone can help us out that would great....

Michael Wright....
