That's because we confused the definition of &quot;stable.&quot;  Stable can mean
&quot;continues to work properly,&quot; and it can mean &quot;doesn't change much.&quot;

As it happened, the 1.0.x series didn't have a fully functional
regression test system (many of the tests didn't work, for various
reasons), so there was little way to guarantee the first definition.
The development 1.1.x series got properly working regression tests
(which still don't test everything), which made following the first
definition more tenable, but since it was the development series the 2nd
definition wasn't followed (*everything* changed, for performance,
stability, correctness...).

Fortunately, the 1.1.13 release is intended to be a longer-lived stable
branch, as it will be shipping with the next SuSE release, and will need
to be supported for at least 7 months.

Consequently we do have a stable release now, 1.1.13, and the later
1.1.x releases can be considered to be development releases.

Hopefully once 1.2 is released we can have *real* stable/development
parallel releases again.
