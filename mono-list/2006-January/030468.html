<PRE>I have a user who says a system named mutex is not being released on
RedHat Enterprise Linux v3 using Mono 1.1.12.1.  I don't have any
particulars yet about how this is happening, so I'm trying to form a
theory on why this is happening.

I've examined the code, and I don't think it is a bug in there.  The
release of the mutex is found in a try/finally, so if the console
encounters an exception, it is guaranteed the mutex would be released.


Is it possible if a console app is killed while owning a system wide
named mutex that the mutex is not released?  (I wonder if that is what
is happening in my reported case - Ctrl-C while owning the mutex.)


On a different note, I'm looking for a way to release system wide
mutexes.  If I encounter a situation where a named mutex is in a &quot;hanged
state&quot; is there a way to release it?  I thought I read Mono used a
daemon to handle system wide mutexes?  If so, what is the name of that
daemon?  Would restarting it release the mutex?  Are there other options
here?

Thanks for your help.
