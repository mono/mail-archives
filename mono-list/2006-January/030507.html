<PRE>Just a quick question.

The Mono documentation at <A HREF="http://mono-project.com/MySQL">http://mono-project.com/MySQL</A> says:

&quot;... the 1.0.7 release of MysQL Connector/Net ... works on Mono on 
Windows and Linux&quot;

I notice in the download (the one without the installer, which is 
therefore suitable for Linux), that there are several different versions 
of the DLL (.NET 1.0, .NET 1.1, .NET 2.0, Mono 1.0).  Presumably I'm 
correct in thinking that it is the one in the 
MySQL/connectornet/bin/mono-1.0/release directory that should be 
installed in the GAC on Linux.  The Windows download had an installer, 
so I didn't notice any different versions, and there is only one version 
in the Windows GAC (Well, there are two actually, but they are just 
slightly different version numbers, not different versions for .NET/Mono).

Now, I'm developing some code that I want to be able to run under both 
.NET on Windows and Mono on Linux.  I'll be doing the development on 
Windows and then installing the binaries created on Windows onto a Linux 
box.  Should that run OK?  Or will I have to cross-compile?  If so, is 
there anything I could do to avoid that (like installing the version I 
have in the Windows GAC into the Mono GAC on Linux??)

What is behind this is that I'm doing some experiments to evaluate the 
portability of CLI code (amongst other things).  If I had to do it, this 
would be the first time I'd had to cross-compile at all.

The reason I'm asking now - before I've hit any problems - is because 
I'd like to know that if I do hit problems it's not because the code 
shouldn't run without cross-compiling.

Thanks in advance.


Peter
