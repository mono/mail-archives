Hi Gabriel, thanks for your response, I've actually resolved that problem.
Possibly a typo but we're discussing SQLite here not MySQL and the column
was actually being reported as an Int64 (long). But, in essence you're right
the Boolean storage class doesn't actually exist in SQlite and it is storing
them internally as 0s or 1s which I have to interpret and cast
appropriately. However that still seems strange given that there is a
GetType method (which technically should report Boolean) and GetBoolean()
which should give me the result as a Boolean. Anyhow, I'm over that now and
have worked around it.

Going back to the current issue, it looks like this LockEx issue could be
(related to) a &quot;known&quot; issue with the current build.

Not sure if anyone has any experience of this or knows of what could be
wrong?
