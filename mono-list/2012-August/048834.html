<PRE>In mySQL boolean values doesn't exist as it. They are short int. You can deal with them like 0 as false and 1 as true.

 &gt; -I use the &quot;URI=&quot; scheme because I think I remember that the &quot;data
 &gt; source=&quot;
 &gt; one didn't work for me.
 &gt; 
 Unfortunately that made no difference

 Nope just what you see in that log output
 
 
 Now here's an interesting thing, I've just switched the DLL (and the using
 statement) to the community one you originally suggested and that works.
 There's another error now but the majority of the features seem to work. It
 connects to the DB, creates tables, populates them and reads from (some) of
 them.
 
 I'm purplexed why the DLL from the monodevelop download wouldn't work but I
 think I'll continue with the community one then for now.
 
 The problem I'm having now is reading Boolean columns, it seems to insist on
 them being returned as Int64's. I'm going to investigate that a little. I
 really appreciate your help so far!
