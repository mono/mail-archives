<PRE>Sorry to bump this thread but this issue is really important to me. 

Our main customers planned to move to open source OSs (mainly linux) and we
need to adapt our main applications to run on that platforms. The only
alternative was to either rewrite everything in java or to run the current
code under mono.

I have spent several days trying to persuade my boss that a migration to the
mono runtime would be feasible, mainly because he sees the mono project as
an &quot;unsupported mess with no future&quot;. It was really hard but I was able to
obtain some days to experiment with the runtime to prove my stance while the
java conversion is kept on hold. The time I was allowed to spend is starting
to run out and I have no notable result to show.

I have downloaded the source code and tried to step into mono code but
without being able to find the root of the problem. I have no knowledge of
the internals of mono and I just get lost in the sea of code.

Please, I relly need some help or at least some hint about where I should
start looking at. 

Thank you very much.

Nicola
