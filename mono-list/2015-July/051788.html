I would love to hear of an 'official' way to do this... but what I do to use XS on OS-X:
First, you do have to configure and make the first time as this stands up your build/dev environment.
I have updated the local classes .csproj files with the matching xxxx.xxxx.dll.sources files for the classes that I work on personally as those Make include files are the gold standard otherwise the configure/make would fail and a lot of the .csproj files are just plain busted (at least in the public git repo). I wrote a simple app that does that for me, hand fixing/editing 68 entries for something like Mono.CSharp x 10 other classes will drive you insane, to get drunk and bald, I am only two of those things right now... ;-)
I also use the project hint path on the references to point back to the &quot;mcs/class/lib/net_4_5&quot; directory (FYI: I'm only working on 4.5 in my case) so I will pick up the 'local' mscorlib, etc.. that I manually reference in the projects.
FYI: Running/debugging items with your build environment using the local mono wrapper ensures that you are grabbing the right runtime, libs,etc... (look in the runtime/ dir for the mono-wrapper script) to see how the machine.config is used.
The best source for understanding how to run apps with this build is the compiler-tester in mcs/tools as you have to have to dogfood the compiler using what you built, from the native binaries (mini-mono/sgen/bohem/...), and the non-modified class libs and then of course your modified versions.

In XS/MD you will then have a startup project (say the mcs compiler in my case) that references the class project that is also in the active solution and flagging it for t use local copy vs the hint pathing to the one in the class/lib/xxx dir allows you to run/debug your class modifications.

Remember, that is my way, nothing official, but it works for me...

Subject: [Mono-list] contributing to mono with monodevelop

Hello!
 
Yesterday I tried to start with some small contribution to the mono class 
library, and failed miserably in the setup process. I checked out the sources 
from github, but I was unable to find a valid solution file, which allowed me 
to edit the framework in monodevelop. All the readmes I found were either very 
outdated or centered on VisualStudio.
Is there some sort of howto for this matter?
 
cheers
Mat
