<PRE>I agree with you 100% but &quot;suits&quot; want that kinda shit, I am just 
relating what i am seeing/hearing with
multi-billion dollar companies I consult for in Canada, they get worried 
about this shit, and
your rational below (I buy it), but the heads of IT's, well they need a 
bit more to feel comfortable.
Also remember, the US DOJ has managed to NOT hand out any justice what 
so ever in anything
to do with MS, the fines are simple some small part of interest on the 
profits they made from the
screw fest the dealt out to  Netscape,Sun, etc,etc.  My point is, use 
Mono, be happy,
and if MS comes in to screw things up, hopefully Mono steers around it, 
just as Linus has said
Linux can steer around SCO (if they won).
