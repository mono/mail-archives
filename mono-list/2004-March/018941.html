<PRE>I'm running an ASP.Net application through XSP on the CVS version of 
mono. XSP has a habit of simply stopping after a few pages have been 
requested from it. I can still close it with Ctrl-C. Basically it just 
serves a few pages and then all managed code stops executing. Has anyone 
else experienced similar problems or have any suggestions?

Regards
