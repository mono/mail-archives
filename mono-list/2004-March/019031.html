Let's face it. Only voicing ourselves is not going to help. Havoc has
brought out some very solid points and a stark reality too. Mono (as of
now) is not clear of legal doubts and Sun won't open source Java. If you
follow some latest news on Sun/Java, you'll find some interesting
things. Sun and M$ are competing for market-hold through Java/.NET
because that's their way to big money. What remains as options now are:
(1) GCJ or (2) Mono/IKVM. It's really a tough decision to take at this
juncture. Significant portions of both Java and .NET are still
proprietary, which have no open-source alternatives. This is what gives
Sun and M$ the impetus to wield managed-platforms monopoly.

The ideal solution might be open-source community having its own
managed-platform which is adaptive of Java and .NET. Or maybe some kind
of standard through which multiple managed-platforms can co-exist and
inter-operate. But that's far from realistic and in all likelihood, that
is not going to happen (at least anytime soon).


&gt;<i> Personally, I think Havoc was taking a very

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &lt; uninformed_and_idealistic_rant &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We would need to get _everyone_ onboard and
</I>&gt;<i> re-engineer the entire desktop into a truely component

</I>&gt;<i> Managed World(tm) ends up being integrated). If the
</I>&gt;<i> entire platform were truely and completely component
</I>&gt;<i> based then I think there would be room for both
</I>&gt;<i> Managed Worlds(tm) and developers could choose to
</I>&gt;<i> target which ever they feel more comfortable with.
</I>&gt;<i> Win, win.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/ uninformed_and_idealistic_rant &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Further more, Havoc sites the problem of a possible
</I>&gt;<i> fork if Mono is chosen and sites the legal limbo
</I>&gt;<i> quagmire that we are currently wallowing in as the
</I>&gt;<i> reason for it. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How is that legal review coming? 
</I>&gt;<i> Do we have a time line?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And finally, I think that if a fork were to take place
</I>&gt;<i> (by Novel choosing to go it alone and integrate Mono
</I>&gt;<i> into the core of its Ximian Desktop) that we would
</I>&gt;<i> survive the storm and eventually we would prevail. I
</I>&gt;<i> think Mono has the critical mass needed in order to
</I>&gt;<i> weather a fork-storm, although I really hope we dont
</I>&gt;<i> need to fork.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please, please, please, please do not sit idly by and
</I>&gt;<i> watch as a Mono based desktop is yanked out of our
</I>&gt;<i> reach. We need action. Lots of it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
As a GNOME fan, I'd love to see GNOME scaling heights. I am sure neither
the Java folks nor the Mono community is going to be silent over it.
Time will tell better, perhaps. :-)

Shantanu
