Ok, I'm wrong. This isn't limited to codebehind and this happens on any 
of the xsp tests. Try opening any of the xsp tests in your browser 
(through xsp of course). Say server-side-object.aspx, but it doesn't 
matter. Hit refresh repeatedly (it doesn't have to be fast) and 
eventually you'll have your browser waiting for the page to load and a 
frozen xsp.

This isn't just my setup as I have two other boxes with different 
configurations and they both have this problem too.
