What would be most helpful is source + the benchmark source ;-).

Failing that, a profile output would be helpful (mono --profile
myapp.exe [args]), however, this will give someone looking at the
profile much less information, as they will have to assume things they
would not have to with the source code.

Also, with the source it is easier to see the benefits of fixes.
