<PRE>Instead of going outside of the project, why don't we just ask to have 
the distribution files include a PGP signed MD5Hash?  This is pretty 
much standard practice for many projects.

</I>&gt;<i> I had a look at mono again yesterday for about a year away from it, and
</I>&gt;<i> you guys have really been productive.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One thing however that I think is a bit frustrating with mono is that to
</I>&gt;<i> bootstrap it you distribute quite a lot of binary files (in the
</I>&gt;<i> mono/runtime directory). This is maybe convinient, but from a security
</I>&gt;<i> standpoint it means that you need to &quot;blindly&quot; trust whoever has control
</I>&gt;<i> over the distribution path of the binaries.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (Modifying mcs.exe that makes string comparisons always succeed if
</I>&gt;<i> compared with the magic string &quot;LawrJj4joR6c&quot; and adding code that makes
</I>&gt;<i> mcs.exe compiled with that &quot;tainted&quot; mcs.exe do the same thing without
</I>&gt;<i> the source code for it is left as an exercise to the reader.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If such a binary was ever included in the mono distribution someone
</I>&gt;<i> would have a magic password that worked here and there and detecting the
</I>&gt;<i> backdoor would be non-trivial.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A solution to this problem would be to have the ability to bootstrap the
</I>&gt;<i> mono environment from a verifiable source. I immediately come to think
</I>&gt;<i> about Portable.NET, since the cscc compiler is written in c and the
</I>&gt;<i> system bootstraps from a standard c environment without any binary code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I just tried to this, with mixed success. A trivial patch to mcs/decl.cs
</I>&gt;<i> to work around a bug in enum initialization in cscc made mcs.exe
</I>&gt;<i> compile. Some more kluges applied to to the mcs sources made mcs.exe
</I>&gt;<i> work in the Portable.NET environment for simple test cases, like
</I>&gt;<i> compiling a runnable HelloWorld.exe.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Trying to compile mono's mscorlib.dll however is a completely different
</I>&gt;<i> experience. Exceptions from
</I>&gt;<i> Mono.CSharp.RootContext.BootCorlib_PopulateCoreTypes decendands all over
</I>&gt;<i> the place.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I was hoping that someone with deeper understanding than me of the
</I>&gt;<i> mono internals could do an estimation on how much work it would need to
</I>&gt;<i> get mono's corlib to compile with mcs.exe executed from the Portable.NET
</I>&gt;<i> runtime.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These are the non-trivial stuff that fails right now:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> error CS0518: The predefined type `System.Char*' is not defined or
</I>&gt;<i> imported
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> the same goes for 'System.Void*'
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Method SetCorlibTypeBuilders is missing from
</I>&gt;<i> System.Reflection.Emit.AssemblyBuilder (btw, isn't there a better way to
</I>&gt;<i> do this than adding non-standard methods to the corlib?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> cheers
</I>&gt;<i> /noa
