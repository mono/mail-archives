Indeed. What is the definition of a propspective &quot;mountpoint&quot; anyway?
Things in /mnt? Things like /{floppy,cdrom}? Things declared with `noauto'
in /etc/fstab? What about LVM mountpoints? Or things that *are* actually
mounted but that *aren't* generally transient in nature - /, /usr, /var,
/home, whatever else people tend to peel-off? There's a case to be made for
most of the above, I think - but I would only go with / as the most
portable, myself.
