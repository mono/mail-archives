<PRE>Well the idea is to work like the Windows version of the framework.  In
actuality Windows boxes only have one logical drive too.  Such as

multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\

then you just keep going on down the list much like hda1, hda2, hda3, etc.

I mean these aren't suppose to be literal they are suppose to return what
the user would think that the literal disks are.  It just happens that in
Windows there is user separation from this process of mounting.

I disagree. The call is get*Logical*Drives. Linux only has a single
logical drive, though it is made up of several physical drives mounted
into it. If you enumerate /, /cdrom, /floppy, /mnt/moredisk,
/mnt/moredisk/someNFSserver then you will end up with applications
double counting files and generally recursing over more then they need
to in order to find a file.

&quot;OK. Enter system password, out of ttys, can't fork process, Panic Double
Panic, can't open socket, bad magic number, NO ROUTE TO HOST, hme is down,
stale file handle, /var is full, and it's January 1970.&quot;
