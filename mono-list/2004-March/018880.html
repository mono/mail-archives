<PRE>I just downloaded the latest CVS of mcs and mono and did the following:

mono$ ./autogen.sh
mono$ make fullbuild

And I got this error:

System.Security.Cryptography/HMACSHA1.cs(110) error CS0246: Cannot find 
type `HMAC'

I found this error previously on the list and people mention that the 
HMAC class only exists in NET_1_2 so I did the following (which seems to 
have worked)

mono$ makke PROFILE=default fullbuild

Will this have broken or crippled my mono installation in any way?
