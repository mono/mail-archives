<PRE>Hello,

If you'r interested in deepder details about the copyright and patents
issue, you should try to go and get them. I'm very sure there are a lot
of places that can *explain* the terms. Really, or at least go ot the
ECMA site and read about what the patents are and how they work.

You should consider that the mono team is a group of coders, and are not
selling the mono platform. They are coders, and they work for make it a
good choice. Is there any place where is it written that every question
should be _fully_ answered? As you should see, every persopn trying to
support Mono has precious time, and thus sometimes is impossible to
answer the best (or the longest) way.

I understand that thay you are not convinced about Mono, and that's ok,
but don't tell that you don't understand the facts. It is possible, of
course, but then you should avoid words than could misunderstood.

Plase avoid the flames, and continue exposing your _true_ questions and
opinions.

Regards,
Carlos.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Not in any way to slight _your_ career in opensource

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; everyone here knows and respects for _his_ career in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; opensource.
</I>&gt;<i> yes, i also respect him very much, but he still didn't answer my (imho
</I>&gt;<i> also andy's) question.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Miguel is also a _very_ respected community leader. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cant even begin to tell you how childish your remarks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about his community building skills seem.
</I>&gt;<i> maybe you're right here, i also like very much his blog entries, but his
</I>&gt;<i> latest mails are a little bit ...let's say not that informative as his
</I>&gt;<i> blog entries
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Furthermore, one would think that you would have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; enough sence to at least be appreciative that he
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bothered to personally answer your questions at all.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When he could have (and should have) been doing a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; zillion other things.
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> wow, we got a mail from Miguel de Icaza PERSONALLY!!!!! WOWOWOWOWOWOWOW
</I>&gt;<i> let's all of us pray before Miguel :)))
</I>&gt;<i> (no, i don't want to offend anyone, but words like &quot;personally anser&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and so on, it seems soooo funny to me)
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> btw. he works/owns/whatever in/for a company which is primarily focused
</I>&gt;<i> on mono. Andy in contrast seems to be  a developer, who would like to
</I>&gt;<i> use mono. so basically Miguel is selling something, and Andy wants
</I>&gt;<i> (wanted, to be more precise) to buy it. so we could also look at this
</I>&gt;<i> from the following point: Andy wasted his time asking the seller some
</I>&gt;<i> questions about a product, and he got no answers from the seller. The
</I>&gt;<i> seller only told him, that he doesn't understand what he is asking, so
</I>&gt;<i> he should better learn all stuff-not-exactly-needed-for-programmers, and
</I>&gt;<i> then...no, he won't get answers even then.
</I>&gt;<i> i am not saying that's the correct point of view. but imho it's as good
</I>&gt;<i> as your point of view.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; =20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But no, he decided that he would personally try to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; asuage your fears regarding MS and Mono, and got
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; flamed for his efforts.
</I>&gt;<i> the same as above.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Instead of flaming him (which is _exactly_ what you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just did) perhaps you could have started by saying:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Thanks for the info. I really appreciate your time Mr
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; de Icaza, but Im _still_ not convinced. Is there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anything more you could show me?&quot;. Eventually the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; magic bullet you are so desperately seeking would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; found.=20
</I>&gt;<i> he asked...how many times? 2x? 3x? and he always got the same answer:
</I>&gt;<i> we-know-better-but-we-dont-give-you-any-proof-go-and-learn-about-patents-=
</I>and-copyrights
&gt;<i> &gt;=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Unfortunately for you, flames have a funny way of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; burning down bridges, so I really doubt you will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; getting more information from _anyone_ here.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Have a nice day :)
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> have a nice day too :)))
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ps. When MS is gone and you're running a Mono based
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GNOME desktop like the other 90% of mankind, remember
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that you blew up and had a hissy fit at one of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GNOME's, Ximian's, and Mono's founding members.
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> i hope you meant this as a joke :)
