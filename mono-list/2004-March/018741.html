However, this is an application i would generally think of as platform bound anyways. It would be a bit easier to comment about the correct behavior with a use case. I am not sure what a file browser shoudl display. On the one hand, having a single root, /, is pretty correct (nautilus does it), however, a root for each drive would be more user friendly. One problem is that on Windows, the drive logical name and the physical drive are very much associated, you say &quot;open up the C drive&quot; or &quot;copy that to the A drive&quot;. So, in Windows, it is user friendly to display &quot;D:\&quot; as the name of the cdrom. However, a user would *not* say &quot;open up /mnt/cdrom&quot; I think showing /mnt/cdrom as a root would actually be wrong.

Using this api to build a crossplatform filebrowser is not only
possible, its extremely easy, and i have done it before and tested it
successfully under .net and mono.

You just drop as a root node in a treestore each path returned from the
GetLogicalDrives and use that.
