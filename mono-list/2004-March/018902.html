<PRE>Daniel:

You are becoming a sort of celebrity among my direct contacts -- a bunch
of Mono, Linux and .NET ethusiast in Dalla/Fort Worth Metroplex.

Don't you dare stopping the great work you are doing -- PLEASE!!!!!!

Matt Gutierrez and myself are on a path to evangelize everyone we come
in contact with.  I have a full time day job were I design and architect
solutions for a company that is 97% Microsoft Windows Technology based. 
They are constantly trying to look for better and more affordable
solutions.

Matt and I fanatically believe that Mono/Linux is it!!!!!!!!!

In the months to come we will have a lot more infrastructure build to
serve our humble independent efforts, and at that point, we will be in a
better position to contribute more aggressively to all things Mono --
especially the Windows expertise part of it.

Without your contributions, it simply would not be possible to
accomplish this.

You can show Windows culture people a lot of things in a linux laptop. 
There is a lot of awe when you build something in MS Visual Studio and
later run it on a Linux box using mint to demonstrate how it &quot;just
simply runs&quot;!

But that is not quite the demo I do now days.  In fact I will argue that
the above mentioned makes for a good novelty that only perpetuates the
running of MS Tools.

The latest little demo I show off today is more like this:

I run the combine Mono .30 / GTK# .15 install you did on a stand alone
windows box.

I go to my laptop and fire up MonoDevelop, and build a quick GTK#
project form scratch.

I add some menu entries to show off code completion in the editor.

Build and run.

later I copy all of the three resulting *.cs files to the Windows box
and compile using mcs from the cmd.exe prompt.

I then run the resulting exe from the command line.

I get some uhh-ahh(s)! -- maybe.

But here is the best part.

I follow up with a run of sqlsharpgtk where I do a MS SQL Server query
and an invocation of &quot;exec sp_who2&quot;.  I show the grid output and the
texpad output.

Finally, I export the resulting query to XML.  I open the xml file with
Internet Explorer.

The rest of the story goes like this.  All present -- mainly C# but some
VB .NET programmer types -- immediately ask to download the combine
Mono/GTK# installer.

Later they ask me what distro I run, followed with the infallible:

&quot;Can you send me an email with the links to all of that stuff&quot;
&quot;Can you show this to my boss?&quot;
&quot;When will you be available for a demonstration to a larger audience?&quot;

Now I ask you.  Do you realize just how important the work you do is?

THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!

PS
Todd, Sebastian, Lluis, Eno, Jackson, Dick, Paolo, Duncan, Miguel, Uhrs,
and Maxi thank you so much for making Matt and I feel like family on the
last Mono Developer meeting at Boston!  You guys rule!!!!!

</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've just installed the latest Mono 0.30 for Windows (using the
</I>&gt;<i> installer), and while previous releases (e.g. 0.28) worked fine for me,
</I>&gt;<i> this one is a major problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Whenever I launch mint or mono to execute an assembly, it comes up with
</I>&gt;<i> the following error:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The assembly mscorlib.dll was not found or could not be loaded.
</I>&gt;<i> It should have been installed in the
</I>&gt;<i> `e:/cygwin/home/danmorg/mono/install/lib' directory.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've read BugID 50085. I have the PATH set to C:\Program
</I>&gt;<i> Files\Mono-0.30\bin and C:\Program Files\Mono-0.30\lib . MONO_PATH is
</I>&gt;<i> set to C:\Program Files\Mono-0.30\lib and MONO_CFG_DIR to C:\Program
</I>&gt;<i> Files\Mono-0.30\etc\mono
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All DLLs, including mscorlib.dll are present in 'lib' directory, I've
</I>&gt;<i> also copied the DLLs to 'bin' just in case, but the error message remains.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does it mean I have to install Mono into a new partition E: ? That is,
</I>&gt;<i> until I compile Mono myself, I plan to do that this weekend. However, I
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't expect my users to do the same :(
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is there a quick workaround not requiring complete recompilation?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maciek Plewa
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PS. This is a minor thing, but I thought I should mention it. The
</I>&gt;<i> msvcr70.dll was not present on my computer (I have mscvr71.dll :), so I
</I>&gt;<i> had to download it from the net and put it in Mono/bin directory. It
</I>&gt;<i> seems this release of Mono for Windows wasn't tested by anyone else than
</I>&gt;<i> the author (danmorg) himself.
