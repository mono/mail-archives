This shouldn't _slow_ down Gnome.  No matter how you look at it, they're
compiled languages - just think about all the applications you have on
your Gnome installation that aren't (Python, Bash, etc).  Naturally
however, being a higher level language does mean some performance
decrease.  But theoretically it shouldn't be a problem with modern day
machines, and should be faster than run-time compile/execution. 
Wouldn't it be nice to compile all the python applications down to one
common binary for use and sharing across multiple languages?  Having
Mono used as the new framework for Gnome (future, not passed) it would
allow Mono/.Net to perform the task it's meant to.  Join multiple
languages together under a common framework so that everyone can
benefit.

Its not like Mono/Java would be used to actually rewrite the entire
framework.  It would slowly entangle itself into the gnome core so that
you could write system and user level applications with them in order to
gain the benefits of higher level languages.
