I think you are missing an important point.

Over the same period of time a managed app will become
more featureful and robust than an app written in a
non-managed language.

Think of it like this: managed apps are like
homosapiens and non-managed apps are like really
advanced slime.

Right now we should be trying to infuse gene's into
GNOME that will ensure its survival in the coming
Managed(tm) world. We need to grow a thumb, or maybe a
cerabellum, not just faster legs. 

What we need is an evolutionary leap and that is going
to cost us something.

We cant afford to be short sited by worrying about a
possible speed hit, this is about survival.

Alex

There is a reason why the speed of hardware doubles
every 18 months, and its not just greed.
