I disagree. The call is get*Logical*Drives. Linux only has a single
logical drive, though it is made up of several physical drives mounted
into it. If you enumerate /, /cdrom, /floppy, /mnt/moredisk,
/mnt/moredisk/someNFSserver then you will end up with applications
double counting files and generally recursing over more then they need
to in order to find a file.

&quot;OK. Enter system password, out of ttys, can't fork process, Panic Double
Panic, can't open socket, bad magic number, NO ROUTE TO HOST, hme is down,
stale file handle, /var is full, and it's January 1970.&quot;
    - sing, sing, halt
