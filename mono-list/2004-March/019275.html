<PRE>Eric:

There doesn't seem to be any overlap between the changes I proposed and 
the ones included with your most recent posting..  I will look at  files 
you have included to try to see if I can apply them and maybe we can 
consolidate all of these modifications for the time being.

I don't think that there is a product defined in the bug database for 
sqlsharpgtk.  I did some searching myself to see if the patches I was 
submitting could correct an existing bug, but I did not find a match for 
the product.

As I stated in some earlier postings to the mailing list, I have a 
personal interest and vision for sqlsharpgtk.  I have recently 
corresponded with the Mono developer that has been taking care of this 
module and he says that he will welcome patches.
