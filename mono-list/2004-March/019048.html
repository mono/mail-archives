<PRE>I just want to chime in quickly here.  There is no technology in the
world today that is &quot;unemcumbered by possible legal tangles.&quot;  If I
recall correctly, someone recently even made a patent claim on the
technology in jpeg images.

As I see it, at least we have the ECMA standards body and public
statements from Microsoft to indicate that other implementations of the
standardized .net runtime and class libraries are allowed and desired
(they even mention mono specifically).  You can search MSDN for these
statements.

Now.. as for ASP.Net and WinForms...  There are no guarantees.

I have been following Mono since it began because I know how productive
this environment can be.  It is of lesser concern to me that it is
compatible with windows apps written against Microsoft's runtime.

There are more people than you would expect out there like me who 1) are
big fans of .net and 2) are big fans of linux.

I think that with some level of advocacy (which I would expect to begin
post 1.0) you will see a huge influx of volunteers working on projects
on linux...

As a Gnome user and fan I'd prefer Gnome remained fast and unencumbered
by possible legal tangles. I don't want EITHER Java nor Mono to form the
basis of Gnome.

Just my personal opinion and I'm a Mono fan as well.
