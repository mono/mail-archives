<PRE>Hello,

I've just installed the latest Mono 0.30 for Windows (using the 
installer), and while previous releases (e.g. 0.28) worked fine for me, 
this one is a major problem.

Whenever I launch mint or mono to execute an assembly, it comes up with 
the following error:

The assembly mscorlib.dll was not found or could not be loaded.
It should have been installed in the 
`e:/cygwin/home/danmorg/mono/install/lib' directory.

I've read BugID 50085. I have the PATH set to C:\Program 
Files\Mono-0.30\bin and C:\Program Files\Mono-0.30\lib . MONO_PATH is 
set to C:\Program Files\Mono-0.30\lib and MONO_CFG_DIR to C:\Program 
Files\Mono-0.30\etc\mono

All DLLs, including mscorlib.dll are present in 'lib' directory, I've 
also copied the DLLs to 'bin' just in case, but the error message remains.

Does it mean I have to install Mono into a new partition E: ? That is, 
until I compile Mono myself, I plan to do that this weekend. However, I 
wouldn't expect my users to do the same :(

Is there a quick workaround not requiring complete recompilation?

Regards,

Maciek Plewa

PS. This is a minor thing, but I thought I should mention it. The 
msvcr70.dll was not present on my computer (I have mscvr71.dll :), so I 
had to download it from the net and put it in Mono/bin directory. It 
seems this release of Mono for Windows wasn't tested by anyone else than 
the author (danmorg) himself.

</PRE>
