It's not like this needs to be decided before we all go to bed.  But we
also cannot sit on it either.  As HP said, we need to have the
discussions in order to make the most intelligent decision.  The
importance seems so surreal, but if RMS (and others) hadn't stood up
firmly for what he believed - we'd be no where.
