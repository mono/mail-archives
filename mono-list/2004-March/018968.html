Good, Im glad that everyone noticed that I was not
commenting on the main subject. I was simply trying to
make the point that flaming people is not a good way
to get the information you need.

Also I made the point that flaming a respected member
of the community (like Miguel) is especially ill
advised.

I purposely did not comment on the main subject. 

The point I was making was about manners, not patents.

I fail to understand how it can be considered *BS*.
Im asuming that you use the word BS to mean that I was
either lying, misleading, or otherwise acting in an
underhanded way.

However the part about calling him &quot;Mr Troll&quot; was a
flame, I appologize, mostly that was done for laughs,
and the same goes for the part about his &quot;hissy fit&quot;.

Im will not reply on this subject further.

ps. Greatest, troll, ever. Wow, Im honored.


&gt;<i> The issues raised by Mr Lewis are completely
</I>&gt;<i> genuine, and had the
</I>&gt;<i> Mono FAQ answered them convincingly there wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> be so many
</I>&gt;<i> recurring questions in the first place. The post by
</I>&gt;<i> Robert Scott
</I>&gt;<i> Horning highlights what could go wrong (in respect
</I>&gt;<i> of clause 7 of
</I>&gt;<i> the GNU GPL). If what Robert explained (that M$
</I>&gt;<i> decides to charge
</I>&gt;<i> a nominal royalty of $0.01 on .NET implementation
</I>&gt;<i> under RAND)
</I>&gt;<i> happens to Mono someday, how could the Mono
</I>&gt;<i> community work around
</I>&gt;<i> that? And would that not affect Ximian's
</I>&gt;<i> distributing Mono at
</I>&gt;<i> all?
