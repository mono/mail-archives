<PRE>Hello Monofolks,

I'd like to apologize in advance if this is the inappropriate forum for my
question, but I looked at other lists and this seemed to be the best choice.
If not, please politely direct me to where I should pose my question.

I'm developing a .Net Web application with C# and I'm currently calling
stored procedures on SQL Server. I would *love* to port this to Mono running
on FreeBSD, but my problem, of course, is the SQL Server data provider. I'm
comfortable with the idea of moving my stored procedures to another
Unix-friendly database, but I was wondering if anyone else was doing
something similar on a non-commercial-license DB, such as Postgresql or
Firebird or whatever, and had any advice or information about their
experience or success.

I realize that this is really as much of a database question as a Mono
question, but I am specifically curious about how the various DB choices
interact with Mono's ADO.NET implementation and whether this community
thinks I stand a chance of success.

My stored procedures, incidentally, are run-of-the-mill, vanilla and boring.
I'm not using any intensive SQL, but I'm not crazy about the idea of using
MySQL since I'd like to continue development on the SQL Server installation
that I have and then simply change the data providers to OleDB providers and
only have to port the stored procedures, rather than creating a whole new
little framework for, somehow, elegantly encapsulating my SQL statements and
calling MySQL that way.

Any advice, information would be extremely helpful.

Thank you in advance.
