<PRE>Hmm.

Actually, what I think it means is that the efforts to assuage the
fears of the users in this regard has not had the success we need.  I'm
not intending to criticize the efforts to clarify this situation up to
this point at all - it seems that significant effort has been put into
understanding the issue, and explaining it to the Mono users.  And I can
understand why &quot;most people are bored to death&quot; with this subject
matter.

However, as long as this question keeps popping up, it means it has not
been sufficiently answered by the FAQ (as the original poster stated). 
And as long as the question is not sufficiently answered, the
uncertainty will remain as a barrier to adoption for Mono.

The question for this group is to what extent that barrier should be
addressed.  I think that question has already been answered.  But let's
not discourage questions like this, even if the group is bored and tired
of the subject.  It simply lets the group know that Mono is becomiing
more widely considered, and the result of this will be more and more
legal concerns.  We need to be prepared to either provide a better
answer to their questions, a more concrete answer like &quot;Microsoft WILL
NOT sue because x, y, and z&quot; (and who's going to pay for that?), or be
prepared to provide the same answer as before (&quot;We don't think Microsoft
will sue, but you should seek your own legal advice&quot;) and be
understanding when people go elsewhere for their solution.

</I>Hello,

&gt;<i> does that mean thay you/mono-devel-team doesn't know the answer to
</I>my
&gt;<i> (original) question?
</I>
We have gone through this too many times, to the point that we have
added this to the FAQ.

It means you are just very late asking that question, and most people
are bored to death with the subject who has been answered in the FAQ.
