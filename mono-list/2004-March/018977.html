Ok, I thought we killed this particular issue a long time ago.. (grin)
 
Here is the take I get from Miguel and someone correct the perception
if I am incorrect....
 
Your application makes use of the framework not the actual libraries
(unless you create a library that extends an existing one). So your OWN
libraries should be safe to do whatever you wish with them. Your
applications themselves should be fine.
 
If you were creating your own C# compiler or assemblies using the
existing APIs (System.Windows, System.Web, etc...) You &quot;could&quot; be at
risk. It again depends on what the terms of the ECMA agreement is and
what the API patents actually are.
 
This particular issue would fall into the lap of the Open Source apps
of dotGNU, Mono, and others (I think Intel has an implementation - but
not open source).
 
So the basics of the answer is that you are not directly affected if
Microsoft has some sort of fee. Your application can freely use the
libraries, but only for the creation of your own apps. If you are
planning to create a lot of extended libraries or your own compiler (I
think few of us are on this list for that), then you may want to review
it (the license and the RAND terms) more closely. Technically the people
to actually ask for your own satisfaction are Microsoft and ECMA to be
sure that they are all on the same page. ECMA regarding the ECMA specs,
and Microsoft for the API issue and overall RAND terms if you are
unclear.
 
Everyone, am I pretty much right? Miguel, is this the jist of the issue
you are trying to sum up for everyone?
