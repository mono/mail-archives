<PRE>I definitely think that the best and least complicated way to go about
doing what this prospect was wanting would be to store the compiled
module or class in a blob field in mysql or sql server. When I get a
response(if I get a response) from the prospect I will post it to the
list and who ever wants to contact him then feel free to do so. All I
ask is that you indicate in your contact that I referred him to you this
way there is not a non-disclosure issue. I told Dave he was more than
welcome to the project as I don't have the time to take on another one
right now. Dave indicated that Jonathan and Jackson may want it as well.
They initially gave me a reply so I would presume they would have first
dibs at it.

Regards,
Shawn

Would it be an idea to store a module (compile cs file) into the 
database? That is what Progress(tm) does with Java classes for trigger 
procedures.

</I>&gt;<i>Hi Shawn.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I know you've gotten a couple of good answers on this already, but I'm
</I>&gt;<i>curious about the application. Would you mind sharing why your client
</I>wants
&gt;<i>to do this? Also, where do they want the code snippets to execute--on
</I>the
&gt;<i>client, or on the server? Will the code snippets manipulate the
</I>database?
&gt;<i>Where will the snippets come from?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I'm intrigued by this idea.

</I>&gt;<i>Does anyone know if the following is possible:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Taking a snippet of .NET c# code, maybe a function, and storing it in a
</I>&gt;<i>mysql db
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>to be later called by another piece of code and executed?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I was asked this question by a client and I dont have the slightest

&gt;<i>on how to answer this. My initial answer is no because it would have to
</I>&gt;<i>be compiled into the calling class; however, I am thinking that
</I>&gt;<i>system.reflection would be able to help me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Any opinions or direction  would be greatly appreciated.
