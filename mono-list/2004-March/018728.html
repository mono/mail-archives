If you are writing something that is portable between the two platforms
then you _Do not_ know that you have a &quot;/&quot;. You might have a &quot;C:\&quot; and
an &quot;A:\&quot;, you might have a &quot;/&quot;, or you might have something else if you
are running on something weird like VMS or RiscOS. 

Think about an app that was written without knowing about Unix, to find
a file, you would enumerate the drives, then enumerate the content of
each. On windows that will work fine, on Unix it would take N times
longer, as the file system is searched many times.

That said, I can see that you might want to expose the set of mount
points to the developer but I think that should be somewhere else in the
API not here.
