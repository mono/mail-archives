There never have been gtk-sharp-devel packages on the mono downloads
page, to my knowledge.

There are -gapi packages for the gapi code generator and parser and
associated files, but there is no point to having a -devel package for
Gtk#.  

IIRC, somebody was shipping packages using the -devel name for their
gapi packages, but that's a poor naming convention, since devel packages
typically contain files needed to link/compile against a library.  The
stuff in gapi is not needed to compile against the Gtk# assemblies. The
only thing that would theoretically go in a -devel is the .pc file, and
it would be pretty silly to require a separate download for that.

So, wherever you got your -devel package, I don't think it was from the
mono project.
