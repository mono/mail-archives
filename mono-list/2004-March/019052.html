<PRE>Hey!

&gt;<i> &gt; So at this point, you might want to consider a career switch.  Growing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; corn and pigs seems to be a fairly safe industry.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You would think so! :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But obviously, you'd be wrong if you've been paying any attention to
</I>&gt;<i> slashdot for the past few years.  Monseto (spelling?) has been trying to
</I>&gt;<i> patent genes, splicing them into plants, and selling plants *under
</I>&gt;<i> license*.  As a farmer, you are NOT allowed to follow the several
</I>&gt;<i> millennium-old practice of *saving the seeds from the previous years
</I>&gt;<i> crop to use in the following year*.  When using genetically-engineered
</I>&gt;<i> seeds, anyway.
</I>
Ah, I had forgotten about that.  You are right, people have written
lengthy articles about Monsanto practices (&quot;The Best Democracy Money Can
Buy&quot; has a good piece), and a google search reveals some more
interesting things.

I will refrain from career advise now, and go back to my corner ;-)

</PRE>
