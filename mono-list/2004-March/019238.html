<PRE>Hello,

I am going to adress the pratical issues you bring up. I am not sure
about legal issues (such as licensing Windows to use the J# assemblies).

&gt;<i> J#,
</I>Assuming the J# assemblies comply to the CLI specs (which I assume, but
have not verified, they do) they should run on Mono. However, there
might be pathing issues, as I am not sure the J# designers were keeping
in mind Linux. They might use &quot;\&quot; as the path seperator char. If this
were the case, you might have to round trip the j# assemblies in an
ilassembler and fix bugs. Of course, you would have to check if this
were compliant with the EULA.

One other option might be to use the ikvm (<A HREF="http://www.ikvm.net/">http://www.ikvm.net/</A>) to
simulate the java classlibs. The issue would be getting things to
compile.
 
&gt;<i> and comercial third party controls.
</I>There are a few possible issues here:
     1. Most component venders obfuscate their code. Some code
        obfuscators emit code that does not comply to the CLI
        specification, and is thus invalid. Some of these invalid
        sequences are incorrectly accepted by Microsoft's jit, while our
        jit compliantly rejects them.
     2. I have seen many third party components that store licencing
        information in the registry obviously this is a problem
     3. As above, a third party component might not be built with linux
        in mind and might hardcode the path seperator char, etc.

All three issues are things that you could obviously bring up with the
vendor.

&gt;<i> Is there now or will there ever be a way to run an app like this on linux mono? 
</I>Short of the above issues, or any issues in your own code, this
application should run on Mono. If it does not, bug reports would help
us to help you get the application running.

Good luck,
-- Ben
