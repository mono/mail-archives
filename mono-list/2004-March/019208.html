&gt;<i> I doubt there is one person in the world who can say that he has 
</I>&gt;<i> traced the creation of his computer environment from square one
</I>
Valid point. However, it's all about risk/feasability. Just because I
can't verfiy evertything back to the big bang doesn't mean that is's
pointless to be somewhat strict about what I do in the environment
that I have choosen to trust.


&gt;<i> In short, the verification of mcs is probably the least of your
</I>&gt;<i> problems. There are much bigger things you would really need to
</I>verify,
&gt;<i> and mcs is easy in comparison.
</I>
I disagree. Yes, mcs is &quot;easy&quot; to verify, but it is also a very powerful
point of entry for some black hat since the abstraction level is much
higher than say the CPU or even your average lib/c compiler.

One can never be totally secure, but an attack that propgagates a trojan
from my cc/libc by the way of the Portable.NET runtime into mcs is
several orders of magnitude more difficult to execute than the attack
that I described in my original post.

Then there is hack value, and that is of course the most important
reason for trying bootstrapping mono from Portable.NET.

&gt;<i> &gt; I just tried to this, with mixed success. A trivial patch to
</I>mcs/decl.cs
&gt;<i> &gt; to work around a bug in enum initialization in cscc made mcs.exe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compile. Some more kluges applied to to the mcs sources made mcs.exe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work in the Portable.NET environment for simple test cases, like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compiling a runnable HelloWorld.exe.
</I>&gt;<i> The correct way to go about this is to fix up cscc. MCS's source is
</I>&gt;<i> valid, it can be compiled with csc. 
</I>
Of course. But hacknig mcs is so much easier since it's written in a
better language :) If there is ever an officially supported way of
bootstrapping mono with Portable.NET all fixes would of course be
applied on the appropriate places in the respective trees first.

&gt;<i> System.Reflection.Emit was never designed to compile corlib. Remember,
</I>&gt;<i> csc.exe is written in C++, it uses Microsoft's internal C++ interface
</I>to
&gt;<i> metadata. To enable mcs to be written in c#, extensions were needed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, if you really want to do this, you would need to replicate the
</I>Mono
&gt;<i> `magic' methods.
</I>
Ok. Perhaps something to do when I'm bored someday.

&gt;<i> Also, you can just compile our corlib with cscc, (that is how it was
</I>&gt;<i> created in the first place, mcs and corlib were compiled with csc, and
</I>&gt;<i> scp'd over to linux).
</I>
True, but that would mean that I'd need to buy windows licenses that I
won't use for anything else.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the reasons stated above, I think this is an effort that will not
</I>&gt;<i> net you any additional security.
</I>
I fail to see how you draw that conclusion. The total security is equal
to the security of the &quot;weakest link&quot; in the chain and you can't know
beforehand which link is weakest. Therefore improving the safeguards
against a certain class of attacks against the distributed mcs/corlib
binaries will give additional security. It might not be much though. And
then there is hack value :)
