<PRE>&gt;<i> We are aware of this problem (not only codebehind). I think there's
</I>&gt;<i> already a bug report for it.
</I>
Is this problem being actively chased? We cannot use XSP or mod_mono for 
  any serious work because it hangs after 10 or so requests (it varies). 
This is often not even enough to load a whole page. Do other people use 
xsp much?

Also, Gonzalo, what do you use for debugging?

Finally, if you have an idea of where this bug is occuring, then let me 
know. I am happy to have a crack at fixing it.
