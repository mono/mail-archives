<PRE>Hi everybody,
I've sent several mail to this mailing list asking for
assistance or confirmation.
What I received so far was a flamewar about stuff that
had already been said or was not going to be answered.

I don't know but I understood this mailing list as one
about developing with mono. If I'm wrong please don't
read any further and tell me wich the right mailing list
is.

If this legal discussion is going on, it blurs those
wo actually try to get some help. So I'd suggest to put
the *legal* requests and discussion into mono-legal
mailing list. -- That's just a suggestion.

I'm a 19 year old German Student and I'm going for my
A-Levels. So I'm interested in mono as I'm a technology
junky and I'd like to explore c# a little. Thus the 
legal case is not really a concern at the moment.

Anyway I tried to ask the following things:
 · Usage of long time tasks with the GUI.
 · If the behaviour of GtkImage from Glade is
   intended or a bug.

For the first I got some answers on the IRC channel.
Some in the GTK FAQ, some in sample apps. So I came
up with three ways of doing it. Wich is confusing, at
lease for someone who tries to start with it.
The latest Codesample, to wich i posted a link in my
previous mail, uses ThreadNotify for this, though I
still do not know if I call it right.

For the second problem, I've not got any help.
I figured how to hack the .glade file to actually
work with mono. But I think that's not the way it's
intended. Thus this might be a bug, but I don't know,
so I ask.

So far my digging into mono was really hard. As I did not
find any good pointer where to look at where to start.
Sure, the tutorial on go-mono.com is good. And also the
monodoc. But the first is only half hearted finished, and
the latter one misses some documentation.
I do not accuse anyone here for not doing so I just try to
make it clear that it's really hard to get one's feet wet
with mono. 

MD is a lot of help when getting started with mono. But
finding the *New Combine* takes some time.

Anyway.
Kindest Regards,
 -mo
