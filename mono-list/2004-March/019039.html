My definition of &quot;Modern Machine&quot; clearly includes your computer since
you happen to run EVERYTHING on it I'm talking about.  As Lupus
(<A HREF="http://www.advogato.org/person/lupus/diary.html?start=10">http://www.advogato.org/person/lupus/diary.html?start=10</A>) points out,
it's not about replacing everything, but rather starting the next
application you develop for Gnome with Mono.  And having that as a
viable core component of Gnome in future distribution releases.

&gt;<i> &gt; Its not like Mono/Java would be used to actually rewrite the entire
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; framework.  It would slowly entangle itself into the gnome core so that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you could write system and user level applications with them in order to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gain the benefits of higher level languages.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Entangle being the word to remember. I don't think of &quot;entangle&quot; as a
</I>&gt;<i> good thing.
</I>
Linux/Gnome/etc is entangled everywhere with depencies.... try removing
python and see what happens.
