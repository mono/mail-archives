<PRE>Howdy! Yeah, its been a while... Been swamped with paying work, so all =
is
good! :)
The queueing landscape is looking to change so much anyway... With the =
move
of so many mono-specific libraries out from under anything Microsoft
copyrighted, I wonder if there still won't be desire/need for a queue =
server
that has no resemblance to all of the MSMQ specific hooks of
System.Messaging...

Thanks for the monocov info. Its features like that, that help =
test-driven
development that help people like me start to discuss Mono as a viable
future alternative. Clients like mine are more than willing to purchase
software from Microsoft for productivity reasons. They do not care about
&quot;free as in speech&quot;. But &quot;free as in beer&quot; along with being productive =
is
what will sway them. Things like Monocov and hopefully more on the =
horizon
that are geared towards productivity is how people like me help push =
Mono...
MonoDevelop is hopefully another ace up the sleeve when it is ready...


Cheers,
David
