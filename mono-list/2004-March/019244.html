<PRE>Ok, after getting those &quot;Bus Error&quot;s I decided to clean out what I 
could and use Fink.  So I did, got it working, but then realized it was 
quite old.  I was also getting some warnings about mscore being old or 
something.  Anyways, I quickly removed Fink's version and decided to 
try my hand at compiling from CVS once again.

I was sent a patch to fix /mono/io-layer/daemon.c  &lt;- This succeeded in 
getting the official 0.31 compiled but I then got the &quot;Bus Error&quot;s as 
stated above.  Now I'm back to not getting through the entire build.  
Now I'm getting:

libtool: link: error: cannot link shared libraries into libtool 
libraries
make[3]: *** [libmono-profiler-cov.la] Error 1
make[2]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make: *** [all] Error 2

I admit that I'm only slightly older than a fresh *nix user.  I have 
libraries all over the place and sometimes have had to symlink to 
libraries to get other programs to compile.  So, my machine isn't the 
cleanest.  But I'm learning right ... :)

Thanks in advance.
