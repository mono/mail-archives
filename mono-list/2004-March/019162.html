Depends on your context.  For implementing Mono, C# is preferred when
possible, to ease maintenance, portability, and it's occasionally faster
than C (due to internal-call overhead, etc.).
 
&gt;<i> Exemple : gtk should be coding in C or in C#. Gtksourceview in C or C#
</I>&gt;<i> ... ? What application, library should be coding in C# ? 
</I>
That's a very contentious issue, and has spawned a great multitude of
blog entries on <A HREF="http://planet.gnome.org.">http://planet.gnome.org.</A>

For the time being, the status quo is probably best: GTK+ in C with C#
wrappers, GtkSourceView in C with C# wrappers, etc.

For new code, developers should use what they're most comfortable with. 
With large exceptions (until contentious issues are resolved): if it's
going to be part of the Gnome platform, it must (currently) be in C.  If
the targeted developer base (for libraries) wants C, use C.

In short, don't force people to use C#, as that's a good way to cause
needless hatred against Mono, making the contentious issues...more
contentious.

It all depends on the particular circumstances.
 
&gt;<i> What will be the performance of gtk if it is coded in C# ? 
</I>
Code it up and give us a performance comparison? ;-)

There are too many variables to answer this question.
