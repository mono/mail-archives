<PRE>Hey All,

I seem to have broken XSP somehow.  I was having a problem with an 
ASP.NET page where I was using codebehind as opposed to inline code.  
It took me a while to get it working, but I finally did.  However, when 
I made changes to the code, the changes didn't propagate (at least as 
far as I could tell, is this a bug?).  So I tried deleting the cached 
dlls in /tmp.  This may have been the step that broke things.

Now whenever I try to hit my pages I get:

Server error in '/mono' application
Cannot find '/mono/whatever_test_page.aspx'.
Description: Error processing request.

Error Message: HTTP 404. Cannot find '/mono/whatever_test_page.aspx'.

(where whatever_test_page is any example page that comes with mono)

I've tried rebooting and deleting .wapi (as per another post).  No dice.

Thanks in advance as always.
-Abe
