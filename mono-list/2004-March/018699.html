I know this is always a topic of religious war, but...

/usr/local is in the default compiler path.  Unless you're committing to 
always maintaining all of mono's dependencies, keeping them up-to-date, 
and making them compatible with other packaging systems, you're going to 
end up causing conflicts with things like fink and opendarwin that 
expect things in different places.

IMHO, /usr/local is for the *local* administrator to put things, not 
3rd-party packagers.  I would suggest /opt/mono or somesuch instead.  If 
people want to use those binaries for their own projects, they can with 
CFLAGS and LDFLAGS, without polluting the default compiler path.

At the very least, put them somewhere out of the way and ask if they 
want you to symlink them to /usr/local.

You can make frameworks manually, by changing things around after 
building using install_name_tool (I do this with the Qt3 packages I made).

Generally you would do something like:

   install -d /Library/Frameworks/MonoVM.framework/Versions/A/Headers
   cp -a /mono/root/include/* \
	/Library/Frameworks/MonoVM.framework/Versions/A/Headers
   cp /mono/root/lib/libmono.dylib \
	/Library/Frameworks/MonoVM.framework/Versions/A/MonoVM
   ln -sf A/MonoVM /Library/Frameworks/MonoVM.framework/MonoVM
   ln -sf A/Headers /Library/Frameworks/MonoVM.framework/Headers
   install_name_tool -id \
	/Library/Frameworks/MonoVM.framework/Versions/A/MonoVM

...or something along those lines.  There's more to it for any 
reasonably complicated framework, but you get the idea.
