That's the problem. &quot;Modern machines&quot;. Is that the consensus? That Gnome
should only run fast on &quot;Modern Machines&quot;? I don't agree with that
certainly. I still run an older machine as my ONLY machine. P3 800mhz
with 768MB of RAM. Granted, that's a decent machine, but nowhere near
what's &quot;current&quot;. Yet because Gnome is *relatively* light (especially
when I compare it to KDE) I can run a Gnome desktop at the same time as
I have Evolution open, XSP running, Apache running, mySQL running,
Ajunta open, Quanta Gold open, a couple bash prompts open, ripping a CD,
playing MP3s, etc. That's the beauty of Linux. A similar task load at my
previous job on a 1GHZ machine with 1GB of RAM would have killed the
machine. So personally, as someone who develops, multi-tasks and enjoys
the fact that my machine NEVER slows down, I don't want to start having
my desktop being run through a VM. Sorry. I already run enough stuff at
different times (Mono, Tomcat, Junit, Ant, etc.) through a VM. I don't
want my Window Manager running off a VM.

</I>
Entangle being the word to remember. I don't think of &quot;entangle&quot; as a
good thing.
