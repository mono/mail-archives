<PRE>:<i>) Yeah, this conversation seems to come up here from time to time.
</I>
The best places to get info these particular questions would probably be 
gtk-sharp-list and monodevelop-list (available at 
<A HREF="http://www.monodevelop.com/lists.aspx">http://www.monodevelop.com/lists.aspx</A>).

As far as the doc goes, make additions with the things that you've found 
and send them to the list to be included.

</I>&gt;<i> What I received so far was a flamewar about stuff that

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know but I understood this mailing list as one
</I>&gt;<i> about developing with mono. If I'm wrong please don't
</I>&gt;<i> read any further and tell me wich the right mailing list
</I>&gt;<i> is.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If this legal discussion is going on, it blurs those

</I>&gt;<i> the *legal* requests and discussion into mono-legal
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list. -- That's just a suggestion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm a 19 year old German Student and I'm going for my
</I>&gt;<i> A-Levels. So I'm interested in mono as I'm a technology
</I>&gt;<i> junky and I'd like to explore c# a little. Thus the 
</I>&gt;<i> legal case is not really a concern at the moment.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway I tried to ask the following things:
</I>&gt;<i>  · Usage of long time tasks with the GUI.
</I>&gt;<i>  · If the behaviour of GtkImage from Glade is
</I>&gt;<i>    intended or a bug.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the first I got some answers on the IRC channel.
</I>&gt;<i> Some in the GTK FAQ, some in sample apps. So I came
</I>&gt;<i> up with three ways of doing it. Wich is confusing, at
</I>&gt;<i> lease for someone who tries to start with it.
</I>&gt;<i> The latest Codesample, to wich i posted a link in my
</I>&gt;<i> previous mail, uses ThreadNotify for this, though I
</I>&gt;<i> still do not know if I call it right.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the second problem, I've not got any help.
</I>&gt;<i> I figured how to hack the .glade file to actually
</I>&gt;<i> work with mono. But I think that's not the way it's
</I>&gt;<i> intended. Thus this might be a bug, but I don't know,
</I>&gt;<i> so I ask.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So far my digging into mono was really hard. As I did not
</I>&gt;<i> find any good pointer where to look at where to start.
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, the tutorial on go-mono.com is good. And also the
</I>&gt;<i> monodoc. But the first is only half hearted finished, and
</I>&gt;<i> the latter one misses some documentation.
</I>&gt;<i> I do not accuse anyone here for not doing so I just try to
</I>&gt;<i> make it clear that it's really hard to get one's feet wet
</I>&gt;<i> with mono. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> MD is a lot of help when getting started with mono. But
</I>&gt;<i> finding the *New Combine* takes some time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway.
