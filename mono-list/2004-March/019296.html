<PRE>Just thought I'd re-ask and elaborate a bit...

I am not talking about Nunit type tools, those are great for =
understanding
the success/failure of tests... I am talking about innate profiling to
easily understand that all functions within a project have been covered =
by a
test. The term in question is &quot;Code-Coverage&quot; and it is simply a way of
knowing during the running of a test-suite that all of the code has been
excercised. It has nothing to do with the success or failure of the =
tests
calling the code.=20

In test-driven development, writing test cases is easy. Knowing that you
have written enough test cases is not. All too often portions of the =
code
are missed or some conditions are not met, so entire sub-sections are =
never
excercised.

So, having elaborated what I meant, can anyone tell me if there is any =
such
support existing or planned for Mono?=20

Subject: [Mono-list] Question on core test support in Mono



Hello...

I just read an article in MSDN magazine about writing profiler DLLs for
dotNet that you can tailor to your individual apps to ensure that your =
test
programs cover 100% of your code. The profilers simply filter out calls =
to
the CLR based upon some criteria built in and they write out listings of =
all
functions or even blocks of code that have been hit when running a test
program.

Unfortunately for dotNet in this instance, this is something that must =
be
written and on a per application basis if you are into hard-core =
test-driven
development and want to PROVE that your tests give you 100% =
code-coverage.

So, what I am wondering is if Mono currently has this or if there is any
intent to put supportiong functionality like this in at the CLR level =
that
can optionally be turned on to help test-driven code-coverage oriented
development?=20

Cheers,
David
