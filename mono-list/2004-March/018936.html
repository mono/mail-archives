Hi,

&gt;<i> There is no right answer to this until it is tested in court. Much like=20
</I>&gt;<i> SCO/IBM/Linux issue.
</I>
There is no SCO-IBM issue other than in Darl's head. Everyone and his
dog agrees there is no validity in it. <A HREF="http://www.groklaw.net">http://www.groklaw.net</A> for the
latest info.

&gt;<i> To be a safe user of Mono, (much like a safe user of Linux),
</I>&gt;<i> you'd have to get it from a vendor that will endemnify it, and maybe
</I>&gt;<i> some day soon, who knows, that could happen.
</I>
Why? Just because a number of distro companies (and IBM) decide to
indemnify doesn't mean anything. All it's there for is to say to
customers, don't worry, use linux and we'll protect you against any
trumped up charges from SCO.

Mono is also a different case. Mono has nothing to do with MS, but is
based on the EMCA standards for the language. It is using a clean
implementation (AFAIK) of the windows.forms stuff.

MS, like SCO and Linux, has no hold on mono. Use it and be happy.

TTFN

Paul
