<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> &gt; Just to let everyone know, since there are so many unsatified people using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the Mono installer, I will not create anymore installers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi Daniel!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Currently (in the last xx months), the only way for me to run mono on
</I>&gt;<i> windows is using your installers. I've tried quite a few times to build
</I>&gt;<i> from CVS but something seems borked in my computer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't have any problem when using your installer and I bet there are
</I>&gt;<i> many other silent happy windows installer users out there. Just so you
</I>&gt;<i> know, the mono and mono+gtk packages for 0.30 have been downloaded from
</I>&gt;<i> go-mono.com site about 13000 times this month.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know that it must be frustrating to hear complains such as that after
</I>&gt;<i> doing a hard work but, please, don't give up with packaging mono for
</I>&gt;<i> windows!
</I>
Just a data point (someone asked about this yesterday as well):

You never know how many people are thrilled about your work, you only
hear when someone has a problem.

In fact, we believe that only 1 in every 80 users of Mono subscribes to
the mailing list judging from the downloads and the people subscribed
to the list (I did that exercise a few months ago).

Speaking about the installer for Windows: not every bug is on the
installer for Windows, am sure that many of the problems people are
having with it are related to Unix-isms (the fact that we assume that
people compile software for use on a &quot;prefix&quot;) and to limitations in
our expertise in the Windows culture.

Miguel.
