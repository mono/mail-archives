<PRE>But surely the aforementioned functionality should be exposed to the
developer in a similar manner as he/she would expect - whereby all physical
drives should be available through the call as they are in Windows and .Net.

I am merely thinking of portability between the two platforms, and why have=
 a
method which tells you what you already know - you have a &quot;/&quot;...

I disagree. The call is get*Logical*Drives. Linux only has a single logical
drive, though it is made up of several physical drives mounted into it. If
you enumerate /, /cdrom, /floppy, /mnt/moredisk, /mnt/moredisk/someNFSserver
then you will end up with applications double counting files and generally
recursing over more then they need to in order to find a file.

Panic, can't open socket, bad magic number, NO ROUTE TO HOST, hme is down,
stale file handle, /var is full, and it's January 1970.&quot;
