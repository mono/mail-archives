I don't think you can expect a huge increase for mono on linux although
I am certainly not an expert on this.  What might be helpful is
identifying the areas it is slower, using mono --profile, then the
relevent people could probably tell you and improve it.  I know there is
a relatively high demand for a python compiler, so it would be great to
get it performing well on mono also.

Also, you could use ahead of time compiling to remove the JIT cost,
using: mono --aot the.exe
