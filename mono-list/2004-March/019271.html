<PRE>Hello...

I just read an article in MSDN magazine about writing profiler DLLs for
dotNet that you can tailor to your individual apps to ensure that your =
test
programs cover 100% of your code. The profilers simply filter out calls =
to
the CLR based upon some criteria built in and they write out listings of =
all
functions or even blocks of code that have been hit when running a test
program.

Unfortunately for dotNet in this instance, this is something that must =
be
written and on a per application basis if you are into hard-core =
test-driven
development and want to PROVE that your tests give you 100% =
code-coverage.

So, what I am wondering is if Mono currently has this or if there is any
intent to put supportiong functionality like this in at the CLR level =
that
can optionally be turned on to help test-driven code-coverage oriented
development?=20

Cheers,
David
