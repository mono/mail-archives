I'm not sure if it's not a bug, but I do the same thing (using the 
mod_mono control panel), so to some extent it's normal.

&gt;<i> 2/ Once we restart mod_mono, if we access an aspx page to quickly,

</I>
That's not right. First accesses to pages can take a while as things are 
loaded up, but it should be &lt;10s, unless something unusual is happening 
in your code.

&gt;<i> 3/ Quite often, mod_mono seems to be down. The process is still up, but

</I>
I experience intermittent things as well, but on the order of just a few 
times under 50,000 hits, a day. Still, I continue to do a 
stop/killall/start every six hours.

I also found that in some cases the control panel restart would send 
mod_mono into a big mess of forking new backend processes indefinitely. 
I think I've fixed this but I haven't yet committed the changes.

&gt;<i> The mono version:
</I>&gt;<i> mono: 1.2.6
</I>
You could try a later version though I'm not sure the changes since then 
are relevant.

&gt;<i> Any idea how I can find out more infromation about mod_mono being down?
</I>
You can compile mod_mono from source with the debugging flag. It'll 
output a lot to the error_log, but it would be useful.

&gt;<i> [Fri Apr 25 22:20:51 2008] [error] Not running mod-mono-server.exe
</I>&gt;<i> because no Mo
</I>&gt;<i> noApplications, MonoApplicationsConfigFile or MonoApplicationConfigDir
</I>&gt;<i> specified
</I>
I'm not sure where this is coming from but if it works at all, that 
seems to be spurious.

&gt;<i> [Fri Apr 25 22:20:37 2008] [warn] (22)Invalid argument: Failed to

</I>&gt;<i> tmp/mod_mono_dashboard_XXGLOBAL_1' shared memory dashboard

</I>
I fixed this after 1.2.6, but I don't think it's related to your problems.

So one problem at a time- On the first access after a restart, is the 
timeout occurring in ASP.NET? (i.e. it times itself out)
