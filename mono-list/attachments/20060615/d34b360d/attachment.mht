Hi,

Okay, this is possibly not the best place to be asking this...

I'm trying to build ikvm-0.28.0.0 from the ikvm.net website. Unlike the
version on the go-mono/sources tree, this actually has the sources in
(naughty naughty...)

I have nant installed on my box along with eclipse-ecj (I'm using FC5).

The problem is that with both 0.22.0.0 and 0.28.0.0, the build fails in
the same place and I'm at a loss to see why as everything looks sane.

The error coming up is

[exec]
File ../../classpath-0.19/external/sax/org/xml/sax/AttributeList.java is
missing

I cannot find this file either. Where does it come from?

TTFN

Paul
