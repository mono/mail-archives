<fontfamily><param>Arial</param><x-tad-bigger>I’m trying to install
Mono on Red Hat 9 using Red Carpet, because that’s what the web site
says is the best way to do it. 

 

I finally managed to get most of the components installed (yesterday
Red Carpet wasn’t working for me at all, and kept telling me there was
an I/O Error, but today, it magically started working).

 

I also got gtk-sharp installed, but I get errors trying to install
gtk-sharp-gapi.  Does anyone know where to get the necessary
dependencies?
