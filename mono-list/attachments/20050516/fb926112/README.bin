+DEBUGGING THE DEBUGGER
+----------------------
+
+	* The debugger provides its own internal tracing/debugging facility, which prints diagnostic output related to its internal actions and codepaths.  This facility checks for two environment variables to determine the location and level of debugging/tracing output.  
+
+	* $MDB_DEBUG_FLAGS - determines the category or categories for which the debugger's internal functionality is traced.  Set it according to the following table:
+
+		None			= 0
+		JitSymtab		= 1
+		MethodAddress	= 2
+		Threads			= 4
+		Signals			= 8
+		EventLoop		= 16
+		Wait			= 32
+		SSE				= 64
+		Notification	= 128
+		Mutex			= 256
+		SymbolTable		= 512
+		SourceFiles		= 1024
+
+	Use MDB_DEBUG_FLAGS=2047 to see all messages.  
+
+	* $MDB_DEBUG_OUTPUT - if set to a filepath, the debugger will write all of its internal tracing messages to the specified file.  Otherwise, STDERR is used.
