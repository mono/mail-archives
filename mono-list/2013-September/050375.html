Hey guys:

After I was so kindly helped with my previous question, I managed to get
mkbundle to generate a bundled exe file. How did I manage? I decided to wait
a few months for some new versions of things and stuff just happened to fix
itself with the new versions. The only real issue I have is with pkg-config
and windows not recognizing the single quotes. I replaced those with ...
&quot;back ticks&quot;. 

So, I am able to generate that magic exe; however, it doesn't seem to be
very magic. So much for 'embedding', as I know it now. There are 2 issues.
The first is that when I run the bundled exe, which simply prints &quot;Hello
World!&quot; to the console, it prints nothing. Secondly, when I try to run it,
it says I libmonoboehm-2.0.dll does not exist. I had to put that into the
same directory as the exe.

Now.. my goal is a SINGLE exe with everything. How can I embed libmonoboehm
and actually get the exe to work? It seems there is an actual libmonoboehm.a
file in the libraries folder for mono when you compile stuff together, so
why is this not getting linked in statically so that I don't need the dll? 

As always to the mono guys, your help is greatly and graciously appreciated!
I know that windows is of utmost important to you guys, and you will
continue to support it with ALL of your resources.
