<PRE>Just another note,

Using mod_mono gives us the option to host multiple applications on the same
instance, also letting them both share the same AppDomain I'm assuming.  It
also gives us the option to easily set maximum utilizations for cpu time and
memory.  We also get the option to have the mono-ctrl handler for the
control panel.

Are these things easily available using stand alone xsp instances with
mod_proxy? 

I'm just trying to get a good list of pros and cons for both options and
weigh the results.

Once I get a good grasp of what each implementation offers, I'll gladly
write up some documentation comparing the options so that new adopters will
have a good reference as to what would be best for them.

Thanks for your input,

-
Jesse

Joshua,

Thanks for providing clarification on this.

I believe I remember someone promoting the use of mod_proxy over mod_mono in
a shared environment because they said with mod_mono all requests will be
passed onto the mod-mono-server even html page, images, etc.  I'm not sure
if this is the case or not but I'm just going off what I was told.  They
argued that using mod_proxy you could choose what to proxy to the xsp
instance and what not to proxy, letting apache serve up all the content
aside from specific ASP.NET pages.  

I'm am in the same boat as David here, looking for the best possible setup
for a scalable/secure shared hosting environment, so once again any comments
are appreciated.

Thanks,

Jesse

You can run XSPs and then proxy them with Apache, as you say, but 
alternatively you can run mod-mono-server's and not have to configure 
proxying.  Remember that mod_mono is just a light-weight thing that 
spawns mod-mono-server.exe to run the mono environment.  Normally 
mod_mono starts the mod-mono-server, but you can turn that off to start 
it yourself under a different user, or on another machine.  (See the man 
page for mod-mono-server.exe, I think.)

Also, mod-mono-server runs as the same user as apache (if it is started 
automatically by mod_mono), which at least on Fedora systems is the 
apache user, who has no access to do anything malicious.

&gt;<i> believe people also argue against mod_mono because that would tie the GC

</I>
Since the mono runtime is in a separate process, there's no interaction 
like that.
