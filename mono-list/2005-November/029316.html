<PRE>Hi,
 
I have mod_mono running on a production server and one of my mono
applications fell over. I have to kill the mod_mono process in order to
restart Apache so the website works again. So I checked out my error log
(attached to the bottom of this e-mail). Has the &quot;URI too long&quot; caused the
&quot;Permission Denied&quot;? Is this what's causing my application to crash? Or is
it because my application just has a bug? Any help would be greatly
appreciated.
 
Regards,
 
Camel
