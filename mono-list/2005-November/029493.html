Well, there are some basic stubs that I did (a long time ago). But
AFAIK, nobody is working on implementing one of the providers.

IMHO, SqlMembershipProvider (if it is implemented) should be written so
that it queries a mssql server with the schema that msft's framework
uses -- there would be some value to being able to share an
authentication database with apps that are written on windows. Also, if
somebody wants to quickly migrate an application from windows to linux,
it may be easiest to first do the web part, then the db part. (in fact
one app that I am working on for school would benefit greatly from being
able to attach to the MSFT schema).

If we want to have a provider that uses a free database (which is
needed), it should probably be a mono specific assembly (that way people
on Windows can use it too, if they don't want to pay &gt; $1000 for
sqlserver (and for some reason can't use don't want sqlexpress). We
could still make this class the default in Mono's machine.config, so
that things worked out of the box (however, for this to really work,
we'd need something like sqlexpress's database attaching).

In terms of mysql, pgsql might be a better choice as the mysql provider
is now GPL and we are no longer updating it from upstream.
