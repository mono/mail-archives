Like you say, it's GPL. It hardly matters who &quot;owns&quot; it.

&gt;<i> that prevents you from developping commercial software on it.

You can develop commercial software with it all you want. You just have to
comply with the GPL.

If you intend to publish software that is not GPL-compatible, you have to
pay for the non-free license. However, you don't have to buy it in advance,
just use the GPL version, which is fine as long as you don't distribute the
software.

Interesting analysis.
