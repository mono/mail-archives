<PRE>First off...thanks to everyone for helping me out with this frustrating
problem. There were a few problems that were causing my application not to
run correctly:
 1. The biggest problem was that none of my compiled code events were
firing. This was occuring because in my ASP.NET &lt;<A HREF="http://ASP.NET">http://ASP.NET</A>&gt; on my
windows machine running the .NET framework, I had commented out the
initilize events in the windows generate code, for some custom error
handling I was using. After I uncommented the line and made sure that my
&quot;AutoEventWireUp&quot; value in my aspx file was set to &quot;false&quot;, then my events
were firing.
 2. Next, I was using the MySql.Data provider for .NET 1.1, rather than for
mono and this was causing a run-time error, since this version of the DLL
could not be loaded, so I simply copied the MySql.Data.dll into my bin
directory and wow! everything is working.
 I do want to provide a little tip to those porting ASP.NET
&lt;<A HREF="http://ASP.NET">http://ASP.NET</A>&gt;apps from Windows to mono/mod_mono, running the XSP
server directly is much
easier to use when tracking down errors than sorting through the Apache
error_log. Also if you don't already have it...it is also a good idea to
install mono on your Windows machine along with SharpDevelop, so that you
can insure that your application builds and everything works with mono, at
least until Prj2Make is further along, then I belive you will be able to use
this VS.net plug-in to insure that your appliction is mono compatible.
 Again...thanks to everyong for your help!
