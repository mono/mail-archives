<PRE>G'day Oleg,

&gt;<i> Last 2 monthes I did no changes in code. Frankly, during this
</I>&gt;<i> nothes my work was mostly on business WinForms application.
</I>&gt;<i> I think, I will be busy during next 1-2 monthes, so I cannot
</I>&gt;<i> make big changes myself.
</I>
Yeah, that's we^W non-Novell hackers would always face. Don't
worry, that doesn't matter.

&gt;<i> The greates problem I am worrying today is testing. There are
</I>&gt;<i> 2 areas, where I am not sure: multithreading (race conditions)
</I>&gt;<i> and fully valid HTTP/1.1 protocol implementation.
</I>
Maybe we can write tests for very obvious cases (anyways it won't be
simply done in our NUnit tests).

&gt;<i> Atsushi, I understand your point on source code style and naming
</I>&gt;<i> conventions. It is OK to change code. May be I will do it, but I
</I>&gt;<i> am not sure due to busy time.
</I>
That's OK; we can do it instead.

&gt;<i> I am really INTERESTING what is in archive you attached to mail.
</I>&gt;<i> Some HttpListener extensions? Very interesting! But it seems it
</I>&gt;<i> is broken here - 2 Kb tar only. Or may be I use inproper tool
</I>&gt;<i> to unpack?
</I>
Oh, well, that archive is not something that interesting. It just
packs new missing types that does not seem to exist in the .NET 2.0
beta version you used to write your code (such as HttpRequestHeader
enum). Nothing more than that.

&gt;<i> Thank you, Atsushi Eno. Let me know when my code will be integrated
</I>&gt;<i> to Mono, it will make me happy these cold days :-)
</I>
If I could make changes to your code before you come back with
enough time, I'll post rewritten one before checking in :-)

Thanks,
Atsushi Eno
</PRE>
