<PRE>Peter,

&gt;<i> &quot;OnStart doesn't call RemotingConfiguration.Configure(). It must be
</I>&gt;<i> a sample from that book doing so.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's a sample from every book I've read on remoting that does so.
</I>&gt;<i> Remember that I'm concerned about services that host remote objects (as
</I>&gt;<i> I said in an earlier post - but you may have missed that).
</I>
I didn't miss that. One may call RemotingConfiguration.Configure()
from OnStart, but this is not a rule.

&gt;<i> &quot;It is true that the working directory of a service is system32.
</I>&gt;<i> Hoewever, Rammer's advice to put the remoting into system32 is
</I>&gt;<i> pretty weird.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not the remoting - if by that you mean the executable - but rather the
</I>&gt;<i> app.config file for the service hosting the remote object.
</I>
Sorry, I missed a word: &quot;remoting config&quot;.

&gt;<i> Once again, Rammer is not on his own.  In my post I also quoted from
</I>&gt;<i> Conger, &quot;Remoting with C# and .NET&quot;, which gives exactly the same
</I>&gt;<i> advice.  I also know that the same advice is given in textbooks for the
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft MCSA exams.  I'll find the quotes tonight when I'm at home, if
</I>&gt;<i> you like.
</I>
Thanks, but I know how it works. They probably crib from each other ;-)

&gt;<i> &quot;You should use that. If simply loads the remoting configuration
</I>&gt;<i> from the app.exe.config of your app, regardless of the current
</I>&gt;<i> directory.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK.  I'll play with that.  The property has to be set, of course, which
</I>&gt;<i> means hard coding a path into code, which is something I like to avoid
</I>&gt;<i> where I can, but it doesn't seem too much of a risk in this situation.
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you.
</I>
The property has not to be set (and cannot be set, unless a new
app domain is created).
It defaults the to the absolute path name of the app.exe.config,
and that's exectly what it's needed for RemotingConfiguration.Config (),
which otherwise tries to pick the file from the current directory.

Rob
