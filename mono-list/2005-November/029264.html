<PRE>Robert,

&quot;OnStart doesn't call RemotingConfiguration.Configure(). It must be
a sample from that book doing so.&quot;

It's a sample from every book I've read on remoting that does so.
Remember that I'm concerned about services that host remote objects (as
I said in an earlier post - but you may have missed that).

&quot;It is true that the working directory of a service is system32.
Hoewever, Rammer's advice to put the remoting into system32 is
pretty weird.&quot;

Not the remoting - if by that you mean the executable - but rather the
app.config file for the service hosting the remote object.

Once again, Rammer is not on his own.  In my post I also quoted from
Conger, &quot;Remoting with C# and .NET&quot;, which gives exactly the same
advice.  I also know that the same advice is given in textbooks for the
Microsoft MCSA exams.  I'll find the quotes tonight when I'm at home, if
you like.

So if it's weird, it's a weirdness that's pretty widespread.

&quot;You should use that. If simply loads the remoting configuration
from the app.exe.config of your app, regardless of the current
directory.&quot;

OK.  I'll play with that.  The property has to be set, of course, which
means hard coding a path into code, which is something I like to avoid
where I can, but it doesn't seem too much of a risk in this situation.
Thank you.

Cheers


Peter
