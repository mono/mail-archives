<PRE>Well, as some may or may not be aware, I was in the Seattle area this
past weekend for an interview at Microsoft on monday...

The day started out pretty well, until the 4th interview.. just got a
kind of bad feeling throughout it...  In any case, I've come away from
that experience with a *very* sour taste in my mouth...  The irony is when
I went up there, half my friends thought it'd be great, the others were
surprised (thinking I hated MS)...  I've always noticed the security
issues, being my #1 concern.. most I blew off, because they were user
driven, and would happen in any OS.  Some were just plain stupid (Outlook,
and outlook express running the IE engine in local/full-trust mode in
the late 90's)...

I've pretty much loved ASP.Net as a platform from the start, and really
enjoy the Visual Studio environment (except for the code mangling in
the VS designer)... I've generally defended things, choosing to err on the 
side of MS's POV.  I like to chose the best tool for the job, but to be 
honest, from what I've seen from their recruiting, I don't care to associate 
with this company irregardless of their tools' merits..  I will continue to 
work with it in the workplace, and will probably continue to attend group 
meetings, but will probably be moving my servers off of windows, starting with 
my bulletin board, and won't be recommending it as a platform for my clients.
