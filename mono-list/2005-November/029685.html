<PRE>David,

I made a post this last weekend when I was trying to get mod-mono-server
running in a chroot jail.  See I am trying to do the same thing and exec my
mod-mono-server instances as each user that owns the site, but since these
users are chrooted, initializing the mod-mono-server fails.

How are you actually starting the process as the user?  Just with a:

su - username -c [command to start mod-mono-server on the application]

or programmatically via setuid/setgid ?

I believe we are trying to do the same thing here.  I however didn't get
back a reply yet on my chroot issues.

If I hear anything I'll keep you posted,

Jesse

Currently I am working on a proxy to put between mod_mono and
mod-mono-server.exe, which executes the mod-mono-server.exe instances for
each customer, using seperate uid's for each domain, which does limit how
much
one customer can access the files all other customers, but we still have
alot of customers who does not set proper permissions on their files, and
therefore there are still plenty of files beloging to other files which are
accessible.
And to eliminate that problem we need to be able to limit which files a
mono/mod-mono-server.exe instance can access, before we can implement it in
our production environment. And therefore I am now asking about the
possibility of souch a functionality getting implementes in
mono/mod-mono-server.exe.
