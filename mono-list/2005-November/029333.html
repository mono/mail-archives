<PRE>I've been hosting an ASP .NET website (written in Visual Studio, hosted 
on Apache with mod_mono on Slackware) for a while now and have been 
using ByteFX 0.76 to interface with MySQL.  During this time, however, 
I've noticed a lot of flakiness with the database connections.  A lot of 
times functions won't return anything when they most definitely should.

Has anyone noticed any such flakiness as well?  I don't think it's 
MySQL, because I put a phpBB board up and it interfaces with the 
database flawlessly.  The .NET code in the matter is terribly simple 
(usually just bind a dataset to a SELECT statement and return the 
dataset), so I'm wondering if it's the data provider.

Can anyone recommend another one they've used that works well for them? 
  I remember when I first started out that it was necessary for me to 
re-compile the data provider myself in order to get it to run in Mono, 
and ByteFX was the only one I found that came with the code and was 
simple enough to do that.  But that was many moons ago and I don't know 
if others would easily work with a more recent Mono.

Any suggestions?
