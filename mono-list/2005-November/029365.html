<PRE>I didn't mean to spark so much debate :)

Anyway, now that my development machine is up and running again I'll be 
testing the official data provider, since that seems to be the 
recommended one.

As for the GPL concerns, I only use the data provider in a very much 
seperate data module (web service project that my other websites call) 
so there's not much actual code to be shared.  Nor do I imagine anyone 
will ask for it (it's my understanding that I only _have_ to provide 
GPL-ed code if someone requests it) because it's hardly interesting or 
revolutionary, and it's very specific to my needs.

Now hopefully I won't have to change much to accomodate the new data 
provider.  I remember some things being a pain before (MySQL TEXT 
fields, for example).

David P. Donahue

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>*  Yes, because the program as it is actually run includes the library.&#187; So,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I guess I was and I am right.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>If I remember right, there is something called FLOSS (or very similar) in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>MySql license that allows you to release your application (the one linking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>to a MySql licensed library) under a license compatible to GPL *and*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>approved by that FLOSS. Not sure what that means but I assume that you can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>do a LGPL library that used .net connector, thus allowing other to link to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>your app with any other license, including closed-source.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>There is a workaround that I was told to work well - to make sure your app
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>works with other providers, like postgres, sqlserver, access, etc.... and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>load the provider dynamically, that is, as an addin (using a xml file and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>reflection....). Again, I'm not sure this works, but I believe so.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Qoting the GPL:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ---- CUT ----
</I>&gt;<i> 2. [...]
</I>&gt;<i> These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
</I>&gt;<i> identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
</I>&gt;<i> and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
</I>&gt;<i> themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
</I>&gt;<i> sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
</I>&gt;<i> distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
</I>&gt;<i> on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
</I>&gt;<i> this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
</I>&gt;<i> entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i> ---- CUT ----
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, this is true that you can make sure your program doesn't have to abide
</I>&gt;<i> by the terms of the GPL by constructing it so that the program is not
</I>&gt;<i> entirely dependant on the MySQL connector assembly. Thus, in my
</I>&gt;<i> understanding, using the ADO.NET interfaces for your work fulfills that
</I>&gt;<i> requirement - you can make your code generic as far as the RDBMS used is
</I>&gt;<i> concerned. Also, I think, the other solution you mentioned - using code
</I>&gt;<i> that's licensed under a GPL-compatible license should be sufficient. You, as
</I>&gt;<i> the author of your application, hold all the rights to the source code and
</I>&gt;<i> the license that governs its use. Therefore, you can create a &quot;glue&quot; assembly
</I>&gt;<i> (it would have to be a separate DLL referenced by your app) and license it
</I>&gt;<i> under (e.g.) MIT _and_ GPL - leaving the user of your code the option to
</I>&gt;<i> choose which license applies to the code of the assembly. Your application 
</I>&gt;<i> would link to the MIT/GPL assembly, thus &quot;separating&quot; your application code 
</I>&gt;<i> from the GPL piece. According to some lawyers I talked to, it would also be
</I>&gt;<i> necessary to include a clause in your main application's license, that it
</I>&gt;<i> can solely be licensed under the terms of this or that license, or otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> your application users could, by implication, assume that since your app
</I>&gt;<i> links with a MIT/GPL assembly and they can use one of those licenses, then
</I>&gt;<i> your application can be considered GPL-ed if they select GPL instead of MIT
</I>&gt;<i> for the glue assembly.
</I>&gt;<i> All of this is very blury and unclear, but that's unfortunately what GPL
</I>&gt;<i> forces us to do in certain situations and is, IMO, one of the greatest harms
</I>&gt;<i> the GPL does to the free software community (this is my personal comment
</I>&gt;<i> only, so please ignore it if you don't agree with it and if you really want
</I>&gt;<i> to discuss it, please write me off the list)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> best regards,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> marek
