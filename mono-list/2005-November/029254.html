<PRE>Hi Peter,

&gt;<i> -----Original Message-----
</I>&gt;<i> From: <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-list">mono-list-bounces at lists.ximian.com</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> [mailto:<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-list">mono-list-bounces at lists.ximian.com</A>] On Behalf Of 
</I>&gt;<i> Bradley, Peter
</I>&gt;<i> Sent: Tuesday, November 01, 2005 1:26 PM
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My post was not intended as a criticism of the man page, and I'm very
</I>&gt;<i> sorry if it appeared to be so.  Perhaps I should have been 
</I>&gt;<i> clearer, but
</I>&gt;<i> what I was really saying that what (I think) is needed is a HowTo.
</I>
Yes I think this is true. There needs to be something in the Wiki.

To answer some of your questions:

&gt;<i> Does the process to be run as a daemon have to inherit from
</I>&gt;<i> System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase?  Does it guarantee that the
</I>&gt;<i> OnStart(), OnStop(), OnPause(), and OnContinue() methods get called as
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate?  
</I>
The service has to be implemented according to the MS docs:
<A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemserviceprocessservicebaseclasstopic.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemserviceprocessservicebaseclasstopic.asp</A>
and
<A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemserviceprocessservicebaseclassruntopic1.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemserviceprocessservicebaseclassruntopic1.asp</A>

Short: It needs to be inherited from ServiceBase and it needs to call 
ServiceBase.Run in it's Main method.

&gt;<i> What does one have to do make the service start 
</I>&gt;<i> up at boot
</I>&gt;<i> time and run without a user logged in?  (Your script is a 
</I>&gt;<i> great help in
</I>&gt;<i> that regard.  Thanks).  What user does the service run as?  
</I>
It runs as the user you are starting mono-service with. You
are responsible for switching the user in the start script.
Examples of start scripts should be in the Wiki/Doc/etc. too.
Maybe that's tootoo distribution specific to put it into SVN?

&gt;<i> What changes
</I>&gt;<i> (if any) are required to assemblies written as Windows 
</I>&gt;<i> services to make
</I>&gt;<i> sure they can run as daemons?
</I>
There are no changes needed if the assemblies are written
with the normal portability rules in mind. Mono-service 
should mimic the behaviour of MS' implementation as close 
as possible.

&gt;<i> The OP obviously has trouble getting the OnStart() method 
</I>&gt;<i> running.  The
</I>&gt;<i> reason why might be contained in the answers to the questions I make
</I>&gt;<i> above.
</I>
Yes :-)

&gt;<i> I'm perfectly happy to put my money where my mouth is as far as
</I>&gt;<i> producing a HowTo is concerned.  Once I've got a daemon 
</I>&gt;<i> running, I'll be
</I>&gt;<i> only too happy to explain how it was done.  But I may need my hand
</I>&gt;<i> holding a little in the meantime :)
</I>
The man page is very basic and contains only information about 
handling of services. There should be an article about implementation
of services too. I would be happy if you write a howto down.
Please ask if you have any questions.

Joerg.
