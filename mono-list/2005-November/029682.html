</I>
Currently I am working on a proxy to put between mod_mono and
mod-mono-server.exe, which executes the mod-mono-server.exe instances for
each customer, using seperate uid's for each domain, which does limit how much
one customer can access the files all other customers, but we still have
alot of customers who does not set proper permissions on their files, and
therefore there are still plenty of files beloging to other files which are
accessible.
And to eliminate that problem we need to be able to limit which files a
mono/mod-mono-server.exe instance can access, before we can implement it in
our production environment. And therefore I am now asking about the
possibility of souch a functionality getting implementes in
mono/mod-mono-server.exe.
