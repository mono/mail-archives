D'oh! I *did* know that, honest.

  can definitely offer support to get this thing going.  The

Those goals seem to align with ours perfectly, because the more 
platforms Mono is fast and stable on, the more platforms we can sell our 
solutions running on.

(Note that I'm just speaking for myself here (and giving my own 
impression of the company's goals) not for the company itself)

I've forwarded your email to our sales rep so we'll see if anything 
comes of it. It probably depends on how determined the potential 
customer is to go with Solaris rather than MS, and how much they're 
willing to pay for the privilege :)

Thanks for the quick answer!

One thing I didn't see in your email is an answer to the question of 
whether the Mono project officially recommends (for or against) running 
Mono on production websites at this stage of development. The published 
information about the SourceGear partnership seemed to indicate that 
this was one of the goals of that project, but I'm not sure what the 
current status of that is.

Thanks again,
Stuart.
