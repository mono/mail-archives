<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> We quickly discovered some issues in Mono 0.29's schema support.  I
</I>&gt;<i> posted on this list and somebody quickly jumped in with a patch.  I
</I>&gt;<i> think everyone can guess what came next -- 3 days of frustration as I
</I>&gt;<i> worked through old and incorrect procedures documented in the Mono
</I>&gt;<i> handbook as well as the Faq.  Finally, someone posted a message that
</I>&gt;<i> contained a step by step procedure, which was 95% correct.  I finally
</I>&gt;<i> got Mono to build on day 4 and was able to return to my porting work.
</I>
Can you point us to the Mono Handbook and the FAQ errors so we can
correct them?  

As things change quickly, we have not had a chance to update everything
that references this mistaken information.

&gt;<i> What's needed even more than a technical or graphic reworking of the
</I>&gt;<i> site is primarily editorial in nature.  Old, obsolete material needs to
</I>&gt;<i> be cleared away.  FAQ's need to lead you in the right direction.  Broken
</I>
Yup, that has been my request about the Monkeyguide on mono-docs-list a
few times.

Am tempted to remove the Monkeyguide from the Mono site until a serious
editorial pass has been done.

&gt;<i> Anyway, this list has been quite helpful to me.  The availability of
</I>&gt;<i> Mono is also helping me reach (and sell) customers I would not otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> be able to service.  I would be happy to help with the editorial work.
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously, I would need lots of help from the much more knowledgeable
</I>&gt;<i> developers that have made Mono what it is today.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Meanwhile, I need to go work on my Mono port :-)
</I>
If you could start posting bug reports to this list, with concrete urls
that are wrong, that would be a fantastic step.

Miguel
