First step is to use something more recent. Use latest 0.29 release or,
if you can handle it, latest code from CVS.

I have a blogX around that works with mono, but may be Ben or Jackson
sent me a slightly modified version that copes with a few minor problems
(file name case and such). May be those fixes got to blogx developers...
