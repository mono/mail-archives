<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> &quot;Most ambitious would be to put the site entirely into ASP.NET, making
</I>&gt;<i> it a showcase for Mono software&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is absolutely critical, and has been a point of contention for some
</I>&gt;<i> time.  By not using your own product, you are telling everyone that even
</I>&gt;<i> the developers can't get it to work on there production site.  To start,
</I>&gt;<i> a basic port and a little cleanup shouldn't be an unrealistic project
</I>&gt;<i> for the talent that in floating around on this project.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Please move the Mono site to Mono/ASP.NET!&quot;  
</I>
No, that has not been the contention issue.

The issue has been that we need:

	a. A new design that can serve the different needs that we have,
	   starting with defining the audience, the layout and its goals.

	b. Design graphically a site that would include support for those
	   audiences defined above, roughly: Installing Mono, Using Mono,
	   Developing with Mono and The Development of Mono.

	c. Someone to oversee the integration of the few pieces of dynamic
	   content that we have.

In fact, today the Mono web site *uses* ASP.NET, just not on the front
page.

So you are wrong in that there is any issue using ASP.NET, we just have
not had anyone who can do (a), (b) and (c) other than what I have done.

Miguel
