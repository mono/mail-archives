 I saw this mentioned on various boards, and shortly discussed a few =
months ago on this list, so it appears possible, but I have yet to be =
successful to get blogX successfully runnning in mono. I am currently =
running the october stable build of mono, so my woes may be entirely due =
to insufficient versions. I have been attempting to utilize the =
webclient of blogX through mono for a little while, and after making =
several alterations I was finally able to view a serverely broken =
representation of the aspx pages (I was forced to remove all of the =
'Inherit=3D' tags, something which I assume shouldn't need to be done, =
nor actually solves the problem. Furthermore, I have had no succes =
getting the web services to run at all, the asmx will compile using mcs =
when signifying the assembly for the namespace and class associated with =
the service, yet when trying to use the service, an exception is thrown =
signifying that it can not locate the needed class or namespace.=20

What steps have you all done to get blogX running in mono? I have been a =
net developer for something near one year now, and would like to get =
involved with mono development, but need a little help getting started. =
I figure blogX is a fun enough place to start. (I have ran most of the =
included examples, so I'm wanting to branch into larger, more realistic =
apps.)
