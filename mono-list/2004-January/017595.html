<PRE>I obviously don't know what Miguel's timeline is for this suggestion,
but I'd like to see the whole thing as ASP.NET running on Mono, even if
it took longer.  Not only would it serve as a showcase for Mono, but it
could also be a good test case (not the production one, mind you, but
the development image), to test the implementation of Mono's features
and ensure they continue to work.

My $.02...

</I>Hello all,

Miguel mentioned to me that we ought to update go-mono.net at some
point. While at first the major site audience was people who wanted to
contribute to Mono as a platform, now we have more kinds of people
that
we need to pay attention to:

* People contributing to the Mono platform
* C# developers who want to use Mono, ASP.NET, gtk#, and so forth, but
don't want to contribute to the platform
* Power-users who want to use things written in C#, but aren't
developers.

I think two or three things we can do. 

The easiest is a simple content update, maybe with some
re-organization.
We'll make sure that info on use and installation is easy to find,
clean
up the directory structure into a few primary sections:
news/about/general, platform development, programming with C#/Mono,
and
using Mono/C# software. This would be relatively simple but wouldn't
solve any major structural issues with the site.

A more serious update would involve redoing the left-hand navigation
and
creating a real directory structure. Ideally, we should have a menu
system that expands as you go down (see www.ximian.com), rather than a
long list of items on the left side of the page. This would be great,
but I probably don't have the autoconf/make/etc. skills to rewrite the
site scripts.

Most ambitious would be to put the site entirely into ASP.NET, making
it
a showcase for Mono software. This would probably mean a ground-up
redesign, and might as well include a new look to emphasize the
difference. That would be really cool. I have no idea how advisable
that
is, though-- it could be a long project that would require resources
better spent on developing mono and software for it.
