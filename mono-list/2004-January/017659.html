<PRE>All,
The point that I was trying to make is that the current site doesn't
clearly reflect the use of Mono/ASP.Net.  This creates the perception of
the site that I tried to describe in my first email.  When I have
directed others to the site, they responded with the same sentiment. 
That's the contention that I was talking about, and not that the Mono
tools/developers/etc are incapable.  This emphasizes the need for
(a,b,c), but wouldn't necessarily be required to change the tone of the
site a little to show more of it's roots.  
  Are you looking for members of the community to do (a,b,c) or are you
looking at resources within Novell?

Regards!

Nick Pavlica

</I>&gt;<i> No, that has not been the contention issue.

</I>&gt;<i> The issue has been that we need:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	b. Design graphically a site that would include support for those

</I>&gt;<i> 	   Developing with Mono and The Development of Mono.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	c. Someone to oversee the integration of the few pieces of dynamic

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, today the Mono web site *uses* ASP.NET, just not on the front
