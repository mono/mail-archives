<PRE>I am trying to build Mono from CVS.  I have cygwin working.  I can build =
mcs just fine. I believe I have libgc installed correctly (installed by =
downloading gc6.2.tar.gz into /usr/src, expanding it, and doing =
./configure; make; make install from /usr/src/gc6.2) but I don't know =
for sure as I am experiencing the following problem when running =
./autogen.sh - prefix=3D/usr/local from my mono directory:

Checking gc.h usability... no
Checking gc.h presence... no
Checking for gc.h... no
Checking gc/gc.h usability... no
Checking gc/gc.h presence... no
Checking for gc/gc.h... no
Checking for GC_malloc in -lgc... no
Error: &quot;GC requested but libgc not found! Install libgc or run configure =
with -with-gc=3Dnone.&quot;

I'm an experienced developer and Windows guy but have limited knowledge =
of Unix and cygwin so I know I am doing something stupid here.  I =
checked the list archives but found nothing that helped me get past this =
issue.  I'd really like to get this build process working so I can =
contribute effectively in the xml.schema area.  Can anyone point me in =
the right direction?

I ran into a similar problem with glib and got past it just fine.  I =
followed more or less the same process (go get the archive, expand it, =
build it and install it) with the libgc without success.

Here's the deal: if I can get this thing working I will document it so =
we have a repeatable process for morons like me :-).  Note that I do =
have an installed copy of mono 0.29 on the Windows box (not under =
cygwin).  I just want to build the latest as it contains some fixes for =
my schema issues. =20

Thanks
