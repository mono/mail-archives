<PRE>&quot;Most ambitious would be to put the site entirely into ASP.NET, making
it a showcase for Mono software&quot;

IMHO :)

This is absolutely critical, and has been a point of contention for some
time.  By not using your own product, you are telling everyone that even
the developers can't get it to work on there production site.  To start,
a basic port and a little cleanup shouldn't be an unrealistic project
for the talent that in floating around on this project.

&quot;Please move the Mono site to Mono/ASP.NET!&quot;

</I>&gt;<i> that is, though-- it could be a long project that would require
</I>&gt;<i> resources better spent on developing mono and software for it.
