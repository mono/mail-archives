Nope. multiple threads can belong to the same appdomain.

If you're embedding mono, you get the initial appdomain from
mono_jit_init(). In threads started by mono you can get the current
domain by calling mono_domain_get (). You call also get the domain an
object belongs to by calling mono_dobject_domain (obj).
If you don't know what appdomains are, you don't need to create them, so
don't use mono_domain_create().

&gt;<i> I may not have described my situation in enough detail.  I have a C#

</I>
If that case you want to get the domain using mono_object_domain(obj)
where obj is the object you pass to the C++ code. Or use mono_domain_get()
from a thread called from managed code, for example when you first go
from C# to C++ code.

&gt;<i> I think that my analysis regarding a deadlock was wrong.  The

Good.
