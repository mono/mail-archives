Hello all,

Miguel mentioned to me that we ought to update go-mono.net at some
point. While at first the major site audience was people who wanted to
contribute to Mono as a platform, now we have more kinds of people that
we need to pay attention to:

* People contributing to the Mono platform
* C# developers who want to use Mono, ASP.NET, gtk#, and so forth, but
don't want to contribute to the platform
* Power-users who want to use things written in C#, but aren't
developers.

I think two or three things we can do. 

The easiest is a simple content update, maybe with some re-organization.
We'll make sure that info on use and installation is easy to find, clean
up the directory structure into a few primary sections:
news/about/general, platform development, programming with C#/Mono, and
using Mono/C# software. This would be relatively simple but wouldn't
solve any major structural issues with the site.

A more serious update would involve redoing the left-hand navigation and
creating a real directory structure. Ideally, we should have a menu
system that expands as you go down (see www.ximian.com), rather than a
long list of items on the left side of the page. This would be great,
but I probably don't have the autoconf/make/etc. skills to rewrite the
site scripts.

Most ambitious would be to put the site entirely into ASP.NET, making it
a showcase for Mono software. This would probably mean a ground-up
redesign, and might as well include a new look to emphasize the
difference. That would be really cool. I have no idea how advisable that
is, though-- it could be a long project that would require resources
better spent on developing mono and software for it.
