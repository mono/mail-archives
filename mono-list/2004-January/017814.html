There are a few items in VB that are not implemented that, IMHO, would
make it much more useable.  I'm not sure if anyone is really working on
VB now-a-days, but I would really like to see it improved.  VB is the
most widely used language in the corporate world and a good, free,
implementation would go a long way.  Anyway, here's the items that are
immediately important for me, but unfortunately I don't have the
knowledge to dive into the VB class libraries or compiler and implement
them.

1) Synclock Blocks - System.Threading.Monitor.Enter/Exit is implemented,
but not the &quot;Synclock Object&quot;/&quot;End Synclock&quot; block.  I use this all the
time and the extra 3 lines of code required to use the Monitor class
really clutters things up.
2) IsNothing() Method - The Is keyword is imlpemented so you can do
&quot;Object Is Nothing&quot; but not this more readable version.
3) Preserve Keyword - It's a pain to have to make temporary copies of
arrays when you need to change the bounds.

I'm really impressed with the runtime and class libraries as a whole, I
just wish VB.NET support was at the same level as C#.  I've got a lot of
large applications written in VB.NET that I'd like to run on Mono, but
it's just not feasible to port them to C# or work around everything
that's not implemented.

Thanks,
JD
