Hi, 

I have been looking at the XML Schema code recently, though I am mainly
looking at facet validation at the moment. I am interested in helping
you find problems with our implementation.

Are these the files available at <A HREF="http://www.cip4.org/open_source/intro.php?">http://www.cip4.org/open_source/intro.php?</A>

If so I can't see anything wrong with them at a quick glance as both the
anys are in the ##other namespace, so shouldn't be ambiguous.
Unfortunately I have not had time for a good look at them, and need to
go to bed. 

In the mean-time, have you run IBM's Schema Quality Checker against
them? I find it is a good way of finding things that are against the
spec, even though processors don't detect them. It is available at 
  <A HREF="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xmlsqc">http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xmlsqc</A>

It tends to take a long time on any complicated schema, so don't give up
unless you have given it a few hours.

Let me know if I can help.

David
