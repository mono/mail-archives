Are you really using multiple domains in your app?
If that's not the case you should pass the MonoDomain you get back from
mono_jit_init().

mono_thread_attach() should be called only once per-thread.
If you're using multiple application domains, you may get all sort of
issues, since the mono_thread_attach() implementation is broken in that
case, there is already a bug filed about that.

&gt;<i> situation using Python/C where the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) must be

</I>&gt;<i> Python interpreter.  I am wondering if calling mono_thread_attach() has

</I>&gt;<i> my code when I no longer need to hold it.  Is that the case?  If so,
</I>&gt;<i> what is the call to make this happen?  Or am I just on the wrong track
</I>&gt;<i> entirely?
</I>
If you're using multiple appdomains you're hitting a mono bug. If you're
not, just try using mono_thread_attach() once per thread.

&gt;<i> Lastly, is there any documentation for doing multi-threaded programming
</I>&gt;<i> with Mono?  So far, I have mostly been looking through the code trying
</I>&gt;<i> to find types and functions that look roughly like what I need.
</I>
The API is supposed to be thread-safe, so there should be no particular
thing to do apart from calling mono_thread_attach() in threads not
created by mono. Please, see the suggestions above and report bavk if
they solve your issue.
Thanks.
