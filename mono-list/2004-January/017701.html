<PRE>Hello,

	Over the next few weeks there will be an effort to 'port' as many open
source asp.net applications as possible to Mono and get the patches
pushed up stream. If there are any other asp.net applications that you
would like to see on Mono please speak up now or forever hold your
peace.

Jackson
