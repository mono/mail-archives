<PRE>Hi,

I am running blogx with xsp.exe here:

<A HREF="http://turchin.homelinux.net:81/blogx/">http://turchin.homelinux.net:81/blogx/</A>

It was mostly a battle with Uri capitalization, and a couple of issues
with object scope (The Server object was only addressable via
HttpContext.Current.Serve) in asmx. The latter is fixed in CVS I
think... Now everything seems to be working great. I can even use
WinBlogX from windows to administer it from my windows machine at work
via blogx's web services interface (though there too I needed to change
the case of a couple of Uri's to make it work right). Getting the RSS to
work as a bit of trouble as well, but was related to the asmx thing...

It was not working right with mod_mono in apache last week but I think
this may have changed in CVS as well, I need to test it again...

If you need help or want a copy of the modified sources (or the Makefile
;-), send me a mail (there is a link from my blog as well ;-).

regards,
--chris
