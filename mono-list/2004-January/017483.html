<PRE>Hello Chris,

    Most of the problems that you had resulted from you trying to work
around Mono's build system.   To get a functional Mono, the only piece
you need to compile is `mono-0.29.tar.gz', the setup is very simple:

	wget <A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-0.29.tar.gz">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-0.29.tar.gz</A>
	tar xzvf mono-0.29.tar.gz
	cd mono-0.29
	./configure
	make 
	make install

    That is all you have to do.

    Windows.Forms in Mono 0.29 is sadly broken (it is described on the
release notes for version 0.29).   It is getting fixed, but it is not
yet ready, you will have to wait for that to actually work.

&gt;<i> But, it seems what nothing really works. Is it so hard to include a makefile 
</I>&gt;<i> a configure or
</I>&gt;<i> something for monostub.c. Is it so hard to write some help for your mono_ 
</I>&gt;<i> functions,
</I>&gt;<i> For example where to find the necessary libs?
</I>
Monostub has been outdated for about nine months, that is why it is not
in any makefile, but the code is valuable, and we did not remove it
because of that.   Maybe your story is a reason to remove it to avoid
confusing new people.

Miguel
