</I>
My understand of application domains is still very limited, so I am not
sure I can answer this question definitively.  If threads spawned by
native code each need their own domain, then yes, I am using multiple
domains.  Is there something different that I could call besides
mono_domain_create() to get a valid MonoDomain* to hand off to
mono_thread_attach()?

&gt;<i> If that's not the case you should pass the MonoDomain you get back from

</I>
I may not have described my situation in enough detail.  I have a C#
class with a static Main() function that I execute using Mono.  That
class instantiates an object that (conceptually) derives from a native
C++ object.  The C# object is handed off to C++ code where callbacks are
invoked from a thread spawned by the native code.  The end result is
that a C# object is handled polymorphically by C++ code.  The primary
thread of control in the C# Main() function blocks until the C++ code
shuts down.

At this point, I do not have code of my own that calls mono_jit_init().=20
In the long term, I probably will, but for now, I am concentrating on
making C# applications that can activate and utilize the native C++
libraries I am exposing for use with CLS-compliant languages.

&gt;<i> &gt; After the call into the CIL code returns, however, I appear to get into

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mono_thread_attach().  I have successfully dealt with a similar

</I>&gt;<i> mono_thread_attach() should be called only once per-thread.
</I>&gt;<i> If you're using multiple application domains, you may get all sort of
</I>&gt;<i> issues, since the mono_thread_attach() implementation is broken in that
</I>&gt;<i> case, there is already a bug filed about that.
</I>
I think that my analysis regarding a deadlock was wrong.  The
application was hanging, but I do not know where.  I modified things so
that mono_thread_attach() is called precisely once pre thread, and
things appear to be working quite well now.

&gt;<i> &gt; situation using Python/C where the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) must b=

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; my code when I no longer need to hold it.  Is that the case?  If so,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what is the call to make this happen?  Or am I just on the wrong track
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; entirely?
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> If you're using multiple appdomains you're hitting a mono bug. If you're
</I>&gt;<i> not, just try using mono_thread_attach() once per thread.
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Lastly, is there any documentation for doing multi-threaded programming
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with Mono?  So far, I have mostly been looking through the code trying
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to find types and functions that look roughly like what I need.
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> The API is supposed to be thread-safe, so there should be no particular

</I>&gt;<i> created by mono. Please, see the suggestions above and report bavk if
</I>&gt;<i> they solve your issue.
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks.
</I>
Your suggestion of calling mono_thread_attach() once per thread appears
to have put things into good working order.  Thanks for the help.
