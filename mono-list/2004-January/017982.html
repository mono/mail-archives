<PRE>&gt;<i> Which libraries commonly employed with C# are ISO standards?  I have
</I>&gt;<i> tried reading the ECMA standards docs, but they are ponderous and
</I>&gt;<i> unclear.  I want a simple list of all the namespaces that are ISO
</I>&gt;<i> standard, as distinct from Microsoft proprietary libraries.  I am
</I>&gt;<i> particularly concerned about System.Collections.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I figure you guys have surely done the homework on what's really an ISO
</I>&gt;<i> standard and what's a Microsoft poison pill.

The CLI (which you're surely talking about since in C# there's nothing like &quot;standard libraries&quot; :) seems to be covered here:

<A HREF="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-335-xml.zip">http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-335-xml.zip</A>

It's a huuuge ML document along with its DTD (the XML uses a SYSTEM DTD with a full disk path, which is something I don't understand - probably author forgot not everyone has access to his HDD, just edit it if you need it), which seems to be some kind of exhaustive and complete CLI class documentation. 

The only thing a curious .NET platform user needs to do is to write a simple XSLT stylesheet that extracts exactly those thing he needs :)

Hope this is what you're searching for.
