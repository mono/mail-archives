<PRE>Hi all,

	I don't have a success story (yet), but since i don't know what
	to code right now i'm trying it till it's a success...

I'm currently trying to get Microsoft's PetShop .NET (its answer to
Suns PetStore (Java)) running with Mono and MySQL.

First i thought the hardest part is to make PetShop database indepent
since the first look to its source code offered the use of Sql* classes
all over its bussiness object classes. 

But it was easier than i first thought since replacing all occurrances
of
SqlParameter, SqlDbType, SqlDataReader with its interfaces
(IDataParameter,
DbType and IDataReader) did nearly everything i needed to make it db 
indenpendent. Last step was to rename the Components/Database.cs to
MsSqlDatabase.cs, create a IDataBase interface and write a
MySqlDatabase.cs
implementation which emulates the stored procedure calls with help of C#
code.

In a few hours i got PetShop running on MySQL and Windows XP/IIS
(just the web interface not the XML RPC interface).

But then i tried to run it with XSP, preciously with Apache2/mod_mono
and
encounter some problems:
	
	* binaries compiled with Debug flag and windows csc.exe don't
work
	  with mono-0.29 (that was easy to solve, just recompile with
mcs)

	* The &quot;Inherits&quot; attribute in &lt;%@ Page=...
Codebehind=&quot;Default.asp.cs&quot;
		Inherits=&quot;PetShop.Web.Default.cs&quot; ... %&gt; stopped all
aspx sites
 	  from working with XSP. I don't know if it's valid to refer to
the 
	  Codebehind class in the inherits attribute, but XSP compiles
(which
	  is imho correct) since you can't inherit from its own class. 
	  (Removing the Inherits attribute did the job though...)

	* But after successfull compilation i got a
System.ArgumentException:
	  The requested value was not found in our AspParser:OnTagParsed
method.
	  It would be nice if the exception tells which Xml file and
what enum
	  value couldn't be resolved.

So...before i start reading bugzilla and searching if those &quot;bugs&quot; are
either
solved or not yet mentioned i wanted to ask if someone is currently
working
on getting PetShop running on mono/xsp?

Having a petshop.tar.gz which behavious like the one you can download
from
microsoft.com with Nant.exe scripts instead of the &quot;setup.cmds&quot; which do
e.g. DB generation would be a nice showcase for mono's development
status,
won't it?

Current cvs for petshop:
