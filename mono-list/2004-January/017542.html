<PRE>Hello,

Please keep up your effort which would be a great chance to improve 
schema compilation and validation feature.

The best thing at this point is to file it to bugzilla, with
the means we can reproduce the error. In this case, I could not find 
this problem on any of the schema file provided in the url David Sheldon 
indicated, only getting other simple type compilation error (I haven't 
look into that detail).

Thanks,
Atsushi Eno
