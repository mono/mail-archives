<PRE>Bear with me as I'm guessing this has been answered a thousand times, I
just want to check my understanding and hope I'm asking in the right
place!

After a little to-ing and fro-ing I managed to build Mono 0.29 on Fedora
Core 1 with ICU support. After this I built NAnt, and I'm now trying to
use NAnt. My NAnt.exe is in ~/dev/nant/bin and if I do mono
~/dev/nant/bin/NAnt/exe NAnt runs fine. However I want to run NAnt
without using the fully qualified name if possible. To do this I set
MONO_PATH, so

export MONO_PATH=~/dev/nant/bin/
mono NAnt.exe

This doesn't work. I was very sure that when I tried this initially it
did work, but after logging off and back onto Linux it's stopped
working. 

Am I correct in assuming that MONO_PATH should be enough to find the
'exe' assembly?
Do I need to set anything else?
Is there someway of checking the path that Mono is using to locate
assemblies?
Am I being a complete idiot?

Thanks,

Kevin Jones
