Note that the mono runtime still doesn't support using type at runtime
created with Reflection.Emit (you'd need to save the assembly and load
the compiled type from there...).

</I>
Sample code that would reproduce the problem is appreciated.
Inspect the method running mono under gdb: when you hit the assert
type 'up' until you get inside mono_store_tree() and then type:
print cfg-&gt;method-&gt;name
and
print cfg-&gt;method-&gt;klass-&gt;name

Try to use the code in that method to isolate the bug in a simple test
case.

&gt;<i> II. As part of the attempt to bring scheme to the world of .Net, I am
</I>&gt;<i> trying to support the Microsoft.Vsa interfaces, so scheme could easily
</I>&gt;<i> be used for ASP and as an extension language in applications. Mono still
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't have these interfaces, and I was wondering : Do you want to have
</I>&gt;<i> them? Is there any legal problem with them being part of the Microsoft
</I>&gt;<i> namespace and not part of the standard? I could probably contribute
</I>&gt;<i> them, it doesn't seem like much work. If not, are there any plans to
</I>&gt;<i> support any other script engine technology in mono?
</I>
There is no legal issue: for every piece of functionality that the MS
runtime provides that we don't have we take patches:-)
