<PRE>Hi there,

well, no, I hadn't installed the -dev-packages yet. This morning I tried 
to do it, and the only thing still missing is pango-devel, which depends 
on freetype-devel &gt; 2.0.9.

I downloaded 2.1.2, but I only get the message

no matter if I try to update or to install. Has anyone an idea?

Thanks in advance,

Hi there,

I try to install Gtk# 0.4, but on the Gtk-List nobody could help me with 
my problems, that's why I am trying it here now.

All necessary rpm's are installed, and now there's one problem left 
while running ./configure of Gtk#.

Here's a part of the install protocol:

******************

[...]

Package gtk+-2.0 was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `gtk+-2.0.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable

variable if your libraries are in a nonstandard prefix so pkg-config can
find them.

**********************

But both packages are installed, so what can I do?

Thanks in advance,


Golo
