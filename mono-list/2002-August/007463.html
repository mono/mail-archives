Excellent.

&gt;<i> &gt; This announcement is of course really exciting.  I have only taken a

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a very interesting idea.  I will let Dietmar and Paolo comment further

I think this approach is a really good approach.

&gt;<i> &gt; What I wanted to look into was to use the JIT to generate code that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would end up in a library, basically reusing the JIT, but turning on all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the optimizations for this.

</I>&gt;<i> This approach would also avoid much code duplication.
</I>
This approach is what MS did.  This approach sucks.
You just won't get good performance that way.

An ahead-of-time compiler can afford to spend a lot more time compiling,
and as a result it can use much more sophisticated optimizations than
a JIT compiler can.

There's no point trying to duplicate all of GCC's optimizations in your
JIT compiler; doing that would be a huge amount of code duplication.
It's much better to reuse GCC's optimizer, as Zoltan has done.

Note also that GCC's optimizer has already been ported to a lot more
architectures than the mono JIT has been.  For architectures where
the choice is to use an interpreter or an ahead-of-time compiler,
the ahead-of-time compiler should give a very significant speedup.
