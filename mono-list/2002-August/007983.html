Aha, that's probably it. I'll try it with saving and loading and see how
it works. Suggestion : Maybe until it works it can be emulated using
libraries (Saving and Loading the assembly before trying to create an
instance).

I'll try to arrange for either CVS or at least some packaging of the
current sources so you can try and run it yourself if you want.
Meanwhile I'll also try to do some debugging on my own.

Cool, I'll work on that. Under what namespace do I put these? Mono?
Ximian? (the original is : Microsoft.Vsa)
