Hi,
    To be frank, there has not been a single byte update since about 2
months now. And the only thing working (jilc-0.1) is (or was?) Java
deassembler. But, as far as I have tested jdasm, it was working fine. Oh
yes, there are not tests for AWT etc. Can you give me the class that failed
it?

    Abhaya did some work towards generating the IL-code (not bytecode). I am
in a new environment (just upgraded from campus to office) and updated the
office computer with the latest CVS code just yesterday and would be looking
after it. Hope, I am able to commit some code to it.

Happy Hacking,
Gaurav
