<PRE>The old system was, and will be again, lists of source files stored in
cvs in the root of the relevant assembly, some called 'unix.args', some
called 'list.unix', others called just 'list'. These files aren't just
lists of source files, though, in some cases they also contain
additional mcs arguments (why aren't these arguments just in the
makefiles??).

Anyone who adds a source file to mono has to be very careful that they
also add the source file to the relevant 'list' file otherwise the build
will break on non win32 machines. Point in case: currently corlib
doesn't build because Dick just implemented some stuff in the
corlib/System.Globalization directory, adding the TextInfo.cs file, but
this file wasn't added to the 'unix.args' file, so now CultureInfo.cs
fails to build.

The namespace dependancy idea is  good one, but it might take quite a
bit more work than, say, a few changes to some makefiles...

Piers.

</I>&gt;<i> Out of curiosity what was the old setup?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And out of further curiosity, why don't we (we of course 
</I>&gt;<i> means you ;) just build based on a set of namespaces? That 
</I>&gt;<i> solution does require either nant or make or whatever to 
</I>&gt;<i> parse a file to see if it is inside a proper namespace before 
</I>&gt;<i> compiling and including it. Unless the test classes need to 
</I>&gt;<i> be inside the same namespace as the actual code, but I doubt 
</I>&gt;<i> it is the case.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, all my unit-tests are in the Test namespace. I 
</I>&gt;<i> didn't check which namespace mono uses to put your unit-tests.

</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you may have noticed, however, that the makefiles for the class libs
</I>&gt;<i> no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; longer depend on static lists of source files. the list of files to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compile is generated with 'nant-like' include/exclude rules.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Nant-like lists is one of the reasons we wanted to drop 
</I>&gt;<i> nant altogether ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is cumbersome, because sometimes we would create a 
</I>&gt;<i> temporary file, in that directory and the classes in that 
</I>&gt;<i> directory would get pulled into the library, or would subtly 
</I>&gt;<i> break the build when removed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I liked the old setup a lot more.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Miguel.
