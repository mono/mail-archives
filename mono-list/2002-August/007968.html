</I>&gt;<i> Hey Guyz,
</I>&gt;<i> ________________________________________________________________________
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1st
</I>&gt;<i> about the TenDRA thing. It could be modified to accept managed c++ and 
</I>&gt;<i> inline assembly and to produce CIL. However that would defeat the purpose of 
</I>&gt;<i> porting GCC to .NET and also GCC has many many languages fortran pascal 
</I>&gt;<i> cobol c++ java etc. but TenDRA only uses C++ and the C++ standard library is 
</I>&gt;<i> still not availible under the TenDRA system which is why i say we should 
</I>&gt;<i> stick with GCJ and JILC.
</I>
Porting the GCC backend is neither easy politically nor trivial in terms of
LOC and Work.  TenDRA is the diametrical opposite in those terms.  The STL
functionality will not be in the too distant future.  Trust me, I've been
peripherally involved with the TenDRA project (in terms of Jeroen Ruigrok and
the tendra.org stuff) since before it was the TenDRA project.  For a while
there was discussion of it being the system compiler in xMach.  The version
of TenDRA available online is the last DERA version, and it's not the most
advanced.  A lot of work was done by related people since then, and work on
bringing that online and under the BSD license is being done.  Among the things
which exist after 4.1.2 are MUCH improved C++ support.  Plus there's support
for C, which you seem to have left out.  There is more C software for UNIX
than any other language, unless you count ever 50 line Perl or PHP program 
that some doofus writes and slaps a GPL on and sticks on Freshmeat.

Seriously, this is something I've put a *lot* of thought into.

juli.
