<PRE>Hello,

    Mono 0.15 has been released.

    Mono is an open source implementation of ECMA CLI virtual machine,
and the ECMA C# standard, and includes many classes found on the .NET
Framework as well.  

    The C# compiler is fully functional (we use it to bootstrap this
release for instance, roughly half a million lines of C# code). 

    We skipped version 0.14, that was only an internal release.

* Administrivia:

    As usual, two packages were released.  You only need the first to
    develop applications though:

	<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-0.15.tar.gz">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-0.15.tar.gz</A>
		Runtime engine source code.
		Binaries for the compiler and class libraries.

	<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mcs-0.15.tar.gz">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mcs-0.15.tar.gz</A>
		Source code for the compiler and the class libraries.

		Instructions for recompiling the compiler and the
	 	class libraries is included in mcs-0.13/INSTALL,
		thanks to Alp for authoring this doc.

    RPMS are available for Red Hat 7.3:

	<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/libgc-6.1alpha5-1.i386.rpm">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/libgc-6.1alpha5-1.i386.rpm</A>
	<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/libgc-devel-6.1alpha5-1.i386.rpm">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/libgc-devel-6.1alpha5-1.i386.rpm</A>  
	<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-0.15-1.i386.rpm">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-0.15-1.i386.rpm</A>  
	<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-devel-0.15-1.i386.rpm">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-devel-0.15-1.i386.rpm</A>  

    Debian packages are available too (Robert McQueen)
	&lt;<A HREF="mailto:robot101@debian.org">robot101@debian.org</A>&gt;.

	<A HREF="http://www.debianplanet.org/mono/">http://www.debianplanet.org/mono/</A>

    sources.list for Woody:
	deb <A HREF="http://www.debianplanet.org/mono">http://www.debianplanet.org/mono</A> stable release 
	deb-src <A HREF="http://www.debianplanet.org/mono">http://www.debianplanet.org/mono</A> stable release 

    sources.list lines for sid are: 
	deb <A HREF="http://www.debianplanet.org/mono">http://www.debianplanet.org/mono</A> unstable release 
	deb-src <A HREF="http://www.debianplanet.org/mono">http://www.debianplanet.org/mono</A> unstable release 


		
* Stats:

	1049 commits since July 27th (0.13 release date)

* News

    There are so many news in the past month, that it is very hard to
    summarize it.  Basically: better, faster, more complete Mono.  I
    have included my attempt at a summary:

	* C# Compiler, from Martin Baulig:
	     Definite assignment support.
	     50% faster compilation times.
	     Almost all bugs against the compiler closed.

	* Tim Coleman and Web Services:
	     Tim has started to add support for Web Services.

	* Runtime:
	     Dietmar has been working on our remoting support as well
	     as Interop code.  Structure marshalling got complete
	     now. 

	* Internationalization:
	     Rhys Weatherley author of Portable.NET has contributed
	     his very complete internationalization code to the Mono
	     class libraries.  

	* ASP.NET:
	     Many contributions from Patrik Torstensson to the
	     HttpRuntime.  Gonzalo started to move the XSP page
	     processor into the System.Web assembly.  

	     Once Patrik commits the rest of the new code, it will
	     be possible to use the regular Web servers people write
	     as well as writing an Apache module.

	     Gaurav is back, and has been fixing and improving some of the
	     existing Webform widgets. 

	* Sparc and PowerPC.
	     Mark Crichton updated the SPARC code for Mono, Radek
	     updated the PowerPC port as well.

	* ADO.NET
	     Rodrigo and Dan have maintained thing: the OleDB classes
	     are starting to show signs of life with the LibGDA backend

	* Windows.Forms:
	     Work is progressing on the WineLib-based implementation
	     of the Windows.Forms.  The only way of making sure we
	     can run all Windows.Forms apps on Linux.

	* Resources
	     Dick checked in resource readers and writers.

	* Tons of bug fixes.
	     Everywhere, really.

    This time I had to put together packages, rpms, and release notes
myself, I apologize if I missed an important chunk of work, it is
really hard to read over a thousand commits and try to synthesize.

Enjoy!
Miguel.
