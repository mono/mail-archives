<PRE>Yeah, I can see how that would be a problem.

The main reason I did the rules thing was so we didn't have to maintain
the rather cumbersome lists of source files, which as far as I could
tell were becoming out-of-date quite frequently since not everyone
adding files is building on linux.

It would be simple to add a global rule to exclude all files matching,
say &quot;*/_*.cs&quot; from the build:

diff -u -u -r1.9 library.make
--- library.make        13 Aug 2002 06:45:48 -0000      1.9
+++ library.make        16 Aug 2002 00:25:51 -0000
@@ -5,7 +5,8 @@

 SOURCES_CMD=find . \
          \( -false $(SOURCES_INCLUDE:%=-o -path '%') \) -a      \
-       ! \( -false $(SOURCES_EXCLUDE:%=-o -path '%') \)
+       ! \( -false $(SOURCES_EXCLUDE:%=-o -path '%') \) -a     \
+       ! \( -path '*/_*.cs' \)

 all: .makefrag $(LIBRARY)


Something similar could be added to the nant .build files so people
could use _test.cs, etc... To avoid poluting the build with their
temporary test files. It's kinda clunky, but no more so than
'*/unix.args' .

On the other hand, it would also be simple to back out the whole lot and
go back to the lists... I just see them being more trouble than they're
worth.

Hello,

&gt;<i> you may have noticed, however, that the makefiles for the class libs 
</I>&gt;<i> no longer depend on static lists of source files. the list of files to
</I>
&gt;<i> compile is generated with 'nant-like' include/exclude rules.
</I>
The Nant-like lists is one of the reasons we wanted to drop nant
altogether ;-)

This is cumbersome, because sometimes we would create a temporary file,
in that directory and the classes in that directory would get pulled
into the library, or would subtly break the build when removed.

I liked the old setup a lot more.

Miguel.
