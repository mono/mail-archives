&gt;<i> Hi Juli!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Nice catch - I hadn't thought about that.
</I>
Eh, it just happened to come up in the hello world I was writing :)

&gt;<i> Your patch does indeed solve the problem. However the parser is now
</I>&gt;<i> being called for each new expression, whether it is in the cache or not.
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps a better long term solution would be to cache a structure in the
</I>&gt;<i> lookup table.
</I>
There were a lot of more elegant solutions I could come up with, however to
say I ran into that literally my first day writing C# would be no great
hyperbole.  It is a greater expense now, yes.

&gt;<i> At the moment, FactoryCache maps (pattern, options) =&gt; (factory). It
</I>&gt;<i> could be altered to map (pattern, options) =&gt; (factory, mapping,
</I>&gt;<i> group_count), so that the Regex constructor could pull these details out
</I>&gt;<i> too, and save both parse and compile time.
</I>
group_count logically should be stored with the pattern yes, is there anything
else which maybe should be, too?  I wasn't very familiar with this factory
system, and so I was very hesitant to dig around and try to fix it in this
manner, especially as I did not know how right that was.  If you could do
this, that'd be great, or I could give it a go later.

Thanks much!

juli.
