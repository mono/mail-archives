<PRE>Hi all,
I am a newbie to Mono and this list. I work for a company that
specialises in Mircosoft .NET web development and so I am trying to get
a proof of concept site going on a Mono platform.

I am attempting to get Mono up and running on an OpenBSD server however
I have hit some problems. I guess they are really OpenBSD issues, but I
thought someone here must have dealt with them by now...

I am following the instructions in the
<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/mono-beginning/t1.html">http://www.go-mono.com/mono-beginning/t1.html</A> document, however it
states that a minimum of glib-1.3 must be installed prior to installing
Mono. Unfortunately the OpenBSD 3.1 distro comes with glib-1.2 and my
attempts to make glib-1.3 have met with failure. It fails at
configuration time with the following error:

checking whether NLS is requested... yes
checking for libintl.h... no
found xgettext program is not GNU xgettext; ignore it
configure: error:
*** You must have either have gettext support in your C library, or use
the
*** GNU gettext library.
(<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext.html</A>

bash-2.05a#

The really weird thing is that I have gettext installed and when you do
a gettext -V to get the version information it says it is the gnu
version:

bash-2.05a# xgettext -V
xgettext (GNU gettext) 0.10.35

Can anyone shed some light on this?

Thanks for any and all help you can provide!
