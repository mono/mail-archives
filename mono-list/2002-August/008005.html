<PRE>&gt;<i> Please let me know once we have binaries -- I can write a nice Mac OS X
</I>&gt;<i> installer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is it possible to integrate Mono with Project Builder?
</I>
Actually, I am building it with project builder.  While I think that 
Fink is a Good Thing, I definitely do not want my Mac OS X becoming 
Linux.  (I can hug the penguin, but I don't think I can hug the Linux.)  
So I am focusing on &quot;drag the Mono framework to your 
System/Library/Frameworks (or $HOME/Library/Frameworks) and then (for 
now) drag the .exe assembly onto the Mono application.  Eventually, I'd 
like a MRMonoAppBuilder, kind of like the MRJAppBuilder.  At that point, 
I'd probably put the whole Mono runtime into a Mono.app bundle, but I'm 
not sure.  That part is iffy.  But now you know my goal.  Luckily 
enough, it's not a very challenging goal unto itself.

Radek (rodo) gave me some pointers to Mozilla code that interests me.  
It turns out that the Mac calling convention could be a lot simpler than 
I thought.  It is essentially the Mach calling convention, I think, but 
I could be wrong.  But considering that Mach was designed for the MIPS 
R2000, and the PowerPC is a direct descendant, this is not too 
unlikely.  Kudos to DEC for giving CMU a bargain! Thanks a million, rodo!

Oh, _Love_Is_Hell_... What memories!
