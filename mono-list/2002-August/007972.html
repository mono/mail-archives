Excellent! Did you have to patch or tweak the sources? There are
several people that want mono running on OS X, so, if you can share with
us the changes needed to compile it we'll commit them to cvs so that
other people as well can start testing.

I don't know about the ppc details, but maybe perusing

gives some ideas. Radek is our ppc porting hacker, I'm sure he'll be
able to give more info on the specific problem.
