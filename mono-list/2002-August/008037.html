<PRE>Well, some things I wanted to required some form of the functionality
provided by these three classes, but after trying and failing, I learned
that (in the case of HttpWebRequest/Response) the status docs aren't
entirely correct ;-(.  After looking at the ChangeLog and seeing that
none of them had been updated in a rather long time and not seeing any
posts about these classes on the list I decided it might be a long wait
if I didn't do something about it, so I've started implementing them
based on what was already there.

At this point I've got HttpWebRequest actually using the stream and (I
think) writing at least mostly correct information over it, I need to
review the HTTP specs before I go further, but I can get webpages (and,
unfortunately, headers at this point) back with HttpWebResponse, which
is a lot further than it was when I started.

I should have an almost fully functional (if not completely &quot;correct&quot;)
patch for this by tomorrow and would love some input as this is really
my first attempt at a C# program (outside of some early flailings of
course).
