<PRE>Hi all!

Is there any reason why mono is developed entirely using C?
Why not C++?

Quick look at mono/mono/metadata/ directory shows that you guys are actually
very good at emulating object oriented concepts using C, which are more
naturally expressible using C++ syntax (classes, methods, member variables,
virtual functions). Of course you don't have to use all of C++ language
constructs, but you could benefit from using some of them.

IMHO when you write in C, the number of potential problems resulting from
the language itself is much higher than in C++. How do you deal with it?

I assume there must be some sort of C coding style that you're all
following. I don't mean indentation style, but rather a common way to
express higher level constructs like classes, virtual functions, exceptions,
allocating and freeing memory, namespaces. Where can I download such a
guide?

I'm not a GNU/Linux guy (yet? ;-) but I've heard that gcc is not so good ad
handling c++ code.
I've also heard that it's not as portable as in C mode. Are there any more
reasons why you avoid c++?
