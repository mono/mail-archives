It should be save.
 
&gt;<i> Another question:
</I>&gt;<i> Why does the init method already need the filename ?
</I>
Good question. I the early days of the jit I used it to get the address
of the stack frame. But the code seems to be broken and unused, so I
will try to remove the filename parameter (you can pass an arbitrary
string in the meantime).

&gt;<i> If I get it right, I can still open more than one assembly  at the same within the same domain by calling: assembly = mono_domain_assembly_open (domain, file); right ?
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise I could only load one plugin at a time, which wouldn't make much sense for me.
</I>
yes, you can load more than one assembly.
