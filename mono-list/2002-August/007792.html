<PRE>Out of curiosity what was the old setup?

And out of further curiosity, why don't we (we of course means you ;)
just build based on a set of namespaces? That solution does require
either nant or make or whatever to parse a file to see if it is inside a
proper namespace before compiling and including it. Unless the test
classes need to be inside the same namespace as the actual code, but I
doubt it is the case.
 
Personally, all my unit-tests are in the Test namespace. I didn't check
which namespace mono uses to put your unit-tests.

Hello,

&gt;<i> you may have noticed, however, that the makefiles for the class libs
</I>no
&gt;<i> longer depend on static lists of source files. the list of files to
</I>&gt;<i> compile is generated with 'nant-like' include/exclude rules.
</I>
The Nant-like lists is one of the reasons we wanted to drop nant
altogether ;-)

This is cumbersome, because sometimes we would create a temporary file,
in that directory and the classes in that directory would get pulled
into the library, or would subtly break the build when removed.

I liked the old setup a lot more.

Miguel.
