<PRE>eclipse from eclipse.org does a GREAT job of making connection to a
sourceforge cvs repository brain-dead easy.  It's even got secure shell
built into the client.

There's a project to allow eclipse to work with C# files under windows at
<A HREF="http://www.improve-technologies.com/alpha/esharp/">http://www.improve-technologies.com/alpha/esharp/</A>

The only problem getting this to work on Linux is that mcs appears to take
different command line parameters relative to MS's csc.  A little help with
this project would allow them to work with mono and provide developers with
a pretty sharp (pun intended) development environment that connects easily
to sourceforge.  Either that or create a compatability mode for command line
parameters that mimics csc.

Whaddaya think?

</I>&gt;<i>i've followed the link to JANET (a open-source C# implementation of
</I>&gt;<i>JavaScript) at your site, only to find that this sourceforge project hasn't
</I>&gt;<i>had an update in over a year!!!  any idea what's going on here.  or better,
</I>&gt;<i>do you know of anyone else working on an implementation of ECMA-262 (the
</I>&gt;<i>official standard) that will work in a .NET environment.
</I>
JANET was my project.  There are two reasons the SourceForge project is so
out of date:

1. When I began the project, there was essentially no outside interest.  I
worked on it for a while, and got pretty far (see below).  However,
eventually I set it aside and moved on to other things.  So no work has been
done in quite a while.  There has been a little discussion of JavaScript on
this list recently, maybe something will get started again.  I don't have
time to continue leading the project, but would be happy to help someone
else picking it up.

2. Frankly, I found SourceForge so baffling that I was never able to
successfully upload source, and had to go through an embarassingly
convoluted process even to update the web site.  So SourceForge is out of
date even with respect to the stalled project.

The current project status is as follows: I have a working compiler that
handles most of the  ECMAScript 3 language, and have implemented most of the
core object model.  There is a test file, about 500 lines of JavaScript,
that exercises more or less all of the implemented functionality.  The
current implementation compiles JavaScript to C# source code, but the code
generator is well isolated behind a set of interfaces, and it should be easy
to add direct-to-CIL support.

I have not yet tried to implement any of the jscript.net extensions, partly
because (at the time) I couldn't find a specification for this language --
just some tutorials and sample code.  If anyone knows of a rigorous
specification for jscript.net, I'd love to hear about it.
