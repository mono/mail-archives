Sure, I'll give it a try. The new code generator will anyway do all the
work in one-shot after reading it from an intermediate representation,
so that should probably solve the problem.

Then we'll still have the problem with dynamic assemblies, but I'll try
to emulate for now. (b.t.w would mono handle it ok if the assembly is
not *really* saved to disk but rather written and read back from a byte
array? that would make things slightly more efficient)

Is there any standard way to determine in run-time what jit we're using
(ms or mono)?
