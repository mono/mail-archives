If I recall correctly, I wrote that class before the other classes necessary to
test it were in place, so if it turns out to be buggy, that's not a huge
surprise.  I think I got the idea that it was buffered from the presence of a
&quot;FillBuffer&quot; method documented in the API docs, but it isn't clear whether the
class always buffers some, and the buffer size is just controlled by
&quot;FillBuffer&quot; or if it only buffers when you call &quot;FillBuffer&quot; before reading. 
Perhaps it would work better if you do the latter.  What does MS's .NET
implementation do?

In any case, since I am now employed by Microsoft, I think it's best if I didn't
contribute further to Mono.  Because I'm working on games for the Xbox -- using
plain old unmanaged C++ -- I don't really have any inside knowledge of the .NET
platform, but I would like to be very careful about not doing anything which
could conceivably jeopardize the Mono project.

I'm sorry I'm not much help, and I wish you guys all the luck in the world.
