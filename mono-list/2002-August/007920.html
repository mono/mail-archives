<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Well, what you actually want to look at doing is making the TenDRA compiler
</I>&gt;<i> produce CIL instead of ANDF/TDF, or write a TDF producer for CIL, both of
</I>&gt;<i> which are pretty darn trivial.  This would allow you to compile most C/C++
</I>&gt;<i> that didn't use inline (machine)assembly.
</I>
Thanks for this pointer Juli.  

I went to look at this, and your approach is indeed very interesting,
because we would get a C/C++ compilers basically for free by writing a
TFT producer for CIL.

Also the source code I have seen for Tendra so far is beautiful.

Miguel.
