I am interested in the GCC because it is so well supported.
Secondly the lack of documentation is a large problem with the gcc, but
people are working on it. One of the motivations for the introspector
project was to help document this structure.

I must admit that my docs are much worse than anything the gcc team has
written.

One of the things that I was looking into was a abstract sytax tree
level two-way translation between the gcc and other compilers,
specifically the cscc compiler.

The idea was to use a simple perl scripting language to do the mapping
between the two... I have paused this to get into many debates about
the legal and moral issues involved, and many people are not happy
about the idea.....

If you go the GCC-GJC compiler path then I will try and help...
