I may be wrong here, but it seems that his question was &quot;is it possible to embed Mono
in C++ apps using compilers other than GCC&quot;? In such case the answer is probably &quot;yes&quot; :-)


&gt;&gt;<i> Will be posible to compile apps with embed stuff with MSVC++?

&gt;<i> I have not tested any C++ code, but I would certainly appreciate some
</I>&gt;<i> samples running on Mono.
</I>
Again this is probably a more specific version of the same question, but here is some
info about running VC++ binaries compiled for CIL target under Mono.
It's possible, but requires a couple of extra things:
    * Micorosoft.VisualC.dll - some attributes and custom mods used by VC++
       (not yet in CVS, but included in my Win32 binary build);
    * System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CallConv* classes, custom mods (same here);

Until recently there was a tiny bug in custom mods reader, so Mono was entering infinite-loop
when loading binaries produced by VC++, this was the main showstopper and it's already fixed.
For some reason it's necessary to disassemble those binaries, then assemble them again,
Mono still refuses to load original binaries (I will look into this issue later).
Also, it's necessary to use appropriate compiler switches to ensure that there is no native
code in the resulting assemblies, and entry point is set to IL code (for EXEs).

All in all, it's already possible to compile C++ code with VisualC compiler and then run
the binary on Linux under Mono. This is very nice, IMO :-)
