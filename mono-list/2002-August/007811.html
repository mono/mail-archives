Eh. Well, I guess that is an implementation glitch.
I don't know the rationale for not allowing C# to create static members
and subtypes in interfaces. Probably it's just a stupid limitation that
should not be there _in the spec_ and the C# compiler writers didn't
feel like enforcing such dumbness on their tool...
Of course this is assuming the rationale for the limitation is not
valid. It would be good if the MS and ECMA people could enlighten us on
that.
