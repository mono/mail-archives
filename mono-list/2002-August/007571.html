<PRE>I'd love to do it but until we move to Linux on the desktop (slated for Q1
2004...we're moving backend servers first and our citrix boxes will move to
X as the last piece of the puzzle) I need to develop the app to work on
Windows and WinForms.  ]

What I can (and plan to) do is isolate the data access portions of the
application from the GUI so there's no reason I can't write some CLI test
code and keep you appraised of how well it runs under mono with postgresql.

Basically, it's our dependence on WinForms that makes full development under
mono undoable.

(Just FYI, for apps that need to remain on Windows until we've found
suitable replacements (mainly ERP stuff) we'll be using Citrix to share the
app to our X session clients)

Will

PS:  Great job on ADO.NET...it sounds like this part of the project is
maturing quickly.

you can be sure that things will work the same in Mono as with the MS's

we've found missing while developing ADO.NET in Mono, but if you keep
using the MS's System.Data classes, things will work out of the box with
no changes (or at least that's the plan :-)

</I>They could be ready if we got more help for implenenting ADO.NET support
in Mono :-)
