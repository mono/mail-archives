You'll have to use a different regset for FP registers: since operations
on FP and integers registers are so different anyway that makes sense.
It's not like you have 64 registers that you can use however you like as
FP or ints. You have two different sets of 32 registers: that maps
pretty well to two different MonoRegSets.

MonoRegSet is a non-issue, see above.
In mono_linear_scan() there are two hardcoded x86 registers, but it's so
easy to remove them: make it an argument to the function (as a bitmap)
and you're done. The function is called from emit-x86.c, so your
customized call will be in emit-ppc.c and it'll use whatever registers
are correct for that arch.
