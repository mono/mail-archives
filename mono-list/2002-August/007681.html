Hello,

&gt;<i> I believe you are the person I heard about who was able to get gtk# to
</I>work
&gt;<i> under Windows.  Can you apply this patch to cvs or provide the source code
</I>&gt;<i> or binaries for those of us interested too?  I prefer the binaries though.
</I>
Actually I haven't looked at the recent GTK# updates (for the past two weeks
or so),
so info below maybe outdated.
The main problem is that there is no clean patch as such, but on the other
hand the problem with
Windows build was really small - native library names are hardcoded in the
sources and they are
not the same under Windows and X11-based system.
So the only thing that was needed to run GTK# under Windows is replacing
these names with
the names of precompiled Win32 DLLs from
<A HREF="http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/downloads.html">http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/downloads.html</A>
This should be fixed in the GTK# codegeneration system, and I believe it was
planned by GTK# guys
to do so, so I will take a look at the most recent version and will let you
know.
Someone else asked for GTK#/Win32 binaries as well, so I will try to find
some time this week to build
DLLs from the latest sources. (There is also a native glue DLL, it may be
tricky to build it on/for Windows,
I uploaded pre-build version of this DLL some time ago, now I think it's
outdated, so I would have to rebuild
it as well).
All in all, my fix is really dirty and can't be applied to CVS (it will
break Linux build), but I can provide
precompiled binaries, just need to schedule some time for this task :-)

&gt;<i> Dear Serge:

</I>&gt;<i> The guy, <A HREF="mailto:groith@tcrz.net">groith@tcrz.net</A>, who has Mono 4 Windows would be glad to include
</I>&gt;<i> your gtk# for Windows binaries in his distribution if you provide them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What problems did you encounter and solve?  What problems still need to be
</I>&gt;<i> resolved?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure there are others like me out there interested in working Mono on
</I>&gt;<i> Windows.
</I>&gt;<i>
