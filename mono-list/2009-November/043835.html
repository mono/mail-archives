<PRE>Dear List users,

I'm requesting your help, because I experience strange crashes while
starting my GTK# application using Mono 2.0.1 and GTK 2.16.1. My code
used to run perfectly with former versions of Mono and GTK, but now I
can't even get the user interface to show up correctly.

The problem seems to be related to the GTK libraries and/or the GTK#
assembly bundled with Mono as this problem didn't exist when using
version 1.2.6 which was used for development. Replacing the native GTK
libraries with an older version (2.12.9) solves the issue, but two
other issues appear: the system theme doesn't get applied to widgets
and one of the widgets completely freezes the application (no
exceptions are thrown, the application just stops handling any
events).
The application runs perfectly on Ubuntu 8.04 (which was used for
development), but any later version fails to run the code.

I attached the stack trace for investigation. According to it, one of
the native libraries does something wrong, probably libx11, as the
last visible function call is XrmQGetResource. I'm not a programming
expert, though, so I just leave it to you to determine what may cause
this behaviour.

Thanks for your help!

Regards
Gergely Kiss
