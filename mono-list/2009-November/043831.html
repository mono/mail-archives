<PRE>Hi,

got a very weird problem with Process.Start here, and I don't know where
to start debugging (first issues actually I ever had with Mono.) Problem
appears like this, I set up a ProcessStartInfo, register the
OutputDataReceived handler, and then I start the process using Start(),
but unfortunately, Start() never returns and the app just hangs. Code
looks like this:

            p.Start();
		// Never comes here ...
            p.BeginOutputReadLine();

I tried it in an isolated test case, but no luck. Using the .NET Runtime
on Windows it works flawlessly, while it hangs _every time_ using Mono.
(Source code:
<A HREF="http://gitorious.org/network/network/blobs/master/NetWork/Task/RunBinaryTask.cs">http://gitorious.org/network/network/blobs/master/NetWork/Task/RunBinaryTask.cs</A>)

Might be related to the network stuff going on, or maybe because it's in
 a ThreadPool :/ I tried to reproduce it in a smaller test case by
starting a thread and trying to read (works), I also tried to run in a
thread pool (works also), so there must be something in the app which
breaks it, but I have no idea where to start debugging.

I checked access rights, these are fine, and running the executable
manually also works fine.

Thanks,
  Anteru
