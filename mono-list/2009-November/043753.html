<PRE>I have to at least partly agree with you here daniel, while I would love to
develop
smartphone applications using C#/Mono, getting an iPhone to do so is not
a compromise I'm willing to make. Too expensive for the masses (outside
of the US anyway) and way too much dictatorship. Frankly, I think Apple and
the iPhone is at its peak at the moment as they transition from small
and lightweight to large and heavy.

Miguel did blog about it a couple of years ago
[<A HREF="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2007/Nov-13-1.html]">http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2007/Nov-13-1.html]</A> and as you mention,
Koushik did get a prototype up and running earlier this year
[<A HREF="http://www.koushikdutta.com/2009/01/mono-for-android-now-available-on.html]">http://www.koushikdutta.com/2009/01/mono-for-android-now-available-on.html]</A>
but since then not much has happened.

Of course, we are free to join in and work on this ourselves (the
typical response) but I just wanted to add that I have also talked to
several other Android developers who would not mind a more expressive
language as well as better runtime, as also investigated by Koushik
