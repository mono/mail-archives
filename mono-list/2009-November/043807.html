<PRE>Hi everyone,

I am developing some software using monodevelop v2.2 beta 1 on opensuse
11.1. A friend is bug chasing for me and he normally runs my program on
Ubuntu 8.04 and has had no problem with that version of Ubuntu.

However he has just bought a new laptop and loaded a clean install of
9.10 because he says he couldn't load 8.04. Trying to run my program
causes a crash on his new laptop see message below.

&gt;<i> The message I am getting is ....
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The assembly mscorlib.dll was not found or could not be loaded. It should have been installed in the 'usr/lib/mono/1.0/mscorlib.dll' directory.&quot; 
</I>


Now I have looked at all the References in my projects and they are all
2.0 or greater but obviously something is looking for version 1.0 which
is not in his install.

So is this a Ubuntu problem or are there some old references I cannot
see in monodevelop.  Finally,is there anything I should be doing to get
around any possible deficiencies in 9.10 and what should I advise him to do?

Thanks

Alan
