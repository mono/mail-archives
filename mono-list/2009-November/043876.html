<PRE>Hello,

I'm not quite sure that this problem is specific to monodevelop but I
have feeling that this might be a problem of compiling mono stack
instead, so I decided to put my questions here.

I tried to build MonoDevelop 2.2b2 on Ubuntu, since there is no
packaged build, to write my first moonlight application. However this
means either I have to use directhex's PPA or I may have to set up
parallel mono environment. I choose the later since by that time I
didn't realized existence of such Mono 2.4 family packages. Now I can
finally build MonoDevelop and open it as an application. However when
I create a new moonlight solution then I check References folder and
see System.Windows and Systems.Windows.Browser gone red. When I tried
to run the solution, &quot;Could not find respack&quot; error is always raised.
I'm not sure that this two problems might related or not but I'm
willing to solve both of them.

Any ideas and suggestions are highly appreciated.
</PRE>
