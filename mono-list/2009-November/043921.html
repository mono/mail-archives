&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> I was looking at the tutorials available for GTK#, and none of them seem to
</I>&gt;<i> be as good as the tutorials available for PyGtk or Gtk+. I realized that the
</I>&gt;<i> PyGtk tutorial is almost like a port of the original GTK+ tutorial with some
</I>&gt;<i> added tutorials regarding TreeViews, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> Since GTK# bears some significant similarity over PyGTK, I felt that it
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't be too challenging to port the code samples and syntax from the
</I>&gt;<i> original tutorial to a newer one. The structure of the tutorial and the
</I>&gt;<i> content has been tested for several years and seem to be effective enough as
</I>&gt;<i> a starting point for material. I decided to start an ambitious attempt to
</I>&gt;<i> port the entire tutorial to GTK# within the next few weeks)
</I>&gt;<i> The original PyGtk tutorial can be accessed from
</I>&gt;<i> here:&#160;<A HREF="http://pygtk.org/pygtk2tutorial/">http://pygtk.org/pygtk2tutorial/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> I have attempted porting a single section just to get a feel for it. You can
</I>&gt;<i> see the original &quot;Buttons&quot; tutorial here
</I>&gt;<i> -&#160;<A HREF="http://pygtk.org/pygtk2tutorial/ch-ButtonWidget.html">http://pygtk.org/pygtk2tutorial/ch-ButtonWidget.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> And also compare it with my attempt available
</I>&gt;<i> here:&#160;<A HREF="http://www.ninjagod.com/gtk-sharp/wikka.php?wakka=Buttons">http://www.ninjagod.com/gtk-sharp/wikka.php?wakka=Buttons</A>
</I>&gt;<i> The conversion was relatively effortless and required a single concise
</I>&gt;<i> read-through and porting the code line-by-line. The rest was just
</I>&gt;<i> copy-paste. Porting is a lot easier if you have an understanding of Python
</I>&gt;<i> (I did), but it's quite readable and obvious. I guess we also need to write
</I>&gt;<i> whole programs and make the source available after testing and making sure
</I>&gt;<i> that it works (My code that I put up there doesn't). It took about half an
</I>&gt;<i> hour to get it done.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm hoping that with enough contributors sharing the work, and not altering
</I>&gt;<i> content significantly, we can finish the conversion fast and effectively,
</I>&gt;<i> and make the learning content available for people who are new to GTK#
</I>&gt;<i> development, and leverage existing documentation. Please email me if you are
</I>&gt;<i> interested in contributing.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, for people who have done something like this before, any advice
</I>&gt;<i> regarding the tools to use, etc would be greatly appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Andy

This was a good idea, but Andy's domain seems to be down which means
his email might be down as well.

Are there any additional tutorials besides what is listed here?
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/GtkSharpTutorials">http://www.mono-project.com/GtkSharpTutorials</A>

Searching for GTK# on Google yields a lot of GTK+ results, making it
hard to get only GTK#-specific pages.
