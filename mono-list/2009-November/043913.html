I have personally tested mod_mono/xsp2 running a Large application. In
fact during one of the tests, if you tried to reach the (Large) site you
had 1 in 16 chances of getting the page served by mono.

There were memory problems that we addressed and the size of the
threadpool had to be tuned based on the results we got for this
application, but in the end the performance and memory use were
acceptable.

</I>
If there were questions related to those problems or bug reports, I
didn't see them and I apologize. But if there were not, you should
consider helping the Mono community by asking the questions or
submitting bug reports if you have problems like these. We all know that
the current GC is not ideal, but there are ways to mitigate the impact
it has on memory usage.
