<PRE>What are mono projects plans regarding Android.

I see that a basic port has been done but that its not good for much 
more then a hello world app.

I assumed that strategically Android would be more important to mono 
then the iphone. Given that android has a Linux kernel and is open 
source, it seems to be a much better fit for mono then what the iphone 
is. And as such would have a larger mind share amongst mono developers. 
Instead a lot of effort has gone in to supporting the most closed and 
tightly controlled mobile platform in existence.

Predictions are that android will overtake the iphone in market share by 
2012. Not only is Android free and open source google is actually paying 
venders to use android (<A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/yzqjmkq">http://tinyurl.com/yzqjmkq</A>). Companies like 
motorola are betting their future on android.

Being able to use mono to do cross platform mobile development would be 
awesome. But the catch is in order to capture a decent share of android 
development you will have to be in early.

The appeal of mono is that it enables cross platform .net development, 
if so why concentrate so much on a single platform to the exclusion of 
the others. (surely its not because you can charge for mono touch, if so 
the mono project has strayed very far from its roots)

It seems to me that mono is excursively betting everything on the wrong 
horse.
