<PRE>Dear All. 

We are currently porting Mono to Android. (and soon also to ChromeOS)

We expect to release the first version in the beginning of next year. (2010)

We do this because we need it for Roozz plugin. A technology layer that allow for cross platform development on 6 platforms and integrate pay-per-use, security, updating and copy-right-protection
www.3djam.com

We hope to make it so that winform programs developed in VisualStudio will run on all platforms without recompile (in most cases). 
The Roozz plugin allow these applications to run both as stand alone &quot;desktop applications&quot; and as applications embedded in a webpage. 
Mono is not integrated into the Roozz technology. But Roozz uses is as an underlying layer for cross platform application development. 

Our project needs funding, so if you are willing to help, we will greatly appreciate this. 

Best regards, 

Thomas Jam Pedersen

Emne: Re: [Mono-list] Android
 
I have to at least partly agree with you here daniel, while I would love to
develop
smartphone applications using C#/Mono, getting an iPhone to do so is not
a compromise I'm willing to make. Too expensive for the masses (outside
of the US anyway) and way too much dictatorship. Frankly, I think Apple and
the iPhone is at its peak at the moment as they transition from small
and lightweight to large and heavy.

Miguel did blog about it a couple of years ago
[<A HREF="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2007/Nov-13-1.html]">http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2007/Nov-13-1.html]</A> and as you mention,
Koushik did get a prototype up and running earlier this year
[<A HREF="http://www.koushikdutta.com/2009/01/mono-for-android-now-available-on.html]">http://www.koushikdutta.com/2009/01/mono-for-android-now-available-on.html]</A>
but since then not much has happened.

Of course, we are free to join in and work on this ourselves (the
typical response) but I just wanted to add that I have also talked to
several other Android developers who would not mind a more expressive
language as well as better runtime, as also investigated by Koushik
