<PRE>Well, seeing as I so far have no reply, can I take that to mean that no 
one uses it, and therefore know one has any advice to give concerning it.

I see that the mono page points to a SVN repository for it, however if 
you look closely at the code it comes with the following warning:

Clutter and all of the related modules have migrated to a git
repository. This SVN repository is now read only and will no longer be
updated.
Please clone the git repository instead by typing:
  git clone <A HREF="git://git.clutter-project.org/clutter">git://git.clutter-project.org/clutter</A>
There is also a web interface to it here:

I haven't tried it yet, But before I waste to much time on it I would 
like to know if it actually works.

As far as I can tell it is not in synaptic, however there are python 
bindings, and javascript bindings.
