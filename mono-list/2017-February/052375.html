<PRE>Hello,


There is no WPF for Mono, and the Windows.Forms stack as Baltasar said has not been maintained since 2009 or so.


You will need to use either Gtk# (version 2, which we use for MonoDevelop, or version 3 which tracks newer versions of Gtk+).   What this means is that you will have to refactor your code to split the UI code from the backend logic,  and write two different implementations, whatever you are using on Windows and another version for your Linux port.


The advantage of course, is that once you do that, you can then add a Mac head trivially.


For what its worth, Xamarin Studio itself uses Gtk# 2, and Xwt.

Subject: Re: [Mono-list] Current state of play, w WPF, or Olive, or Moonlight

Hi,
I'm hoping to get LinqPad running on my Ubuntu workstation. When I run
latest/greatest LinqPad, I get an error saying PresentationCore is missing.

&gt;<i>From some older threads (re OSX), this assembly was found in Olive.
</I>
A current Olive page on the mono-project site, says don't use Olive, use
Moonlight.

A current Moonlight page on mono-project, says don't use Moonlight.

A current look at the mono-olive list archive, is all porn, so I assume
that project is not current or maintained.

Any thoughts on how to get WPF, or at least PresentationCore, installed on
Ubuntu? Or am I out of luck.

The short answer is that yes, you are out of luck.
The long answer is that Xamarin is devoted to portable devices, and does not care very much about the desktop.

WinForms was never finished. It seems it is crap in Mac.
Gtk# seems to be stuck in version 2, thoug there is a NuGET package for version 3 (don't know why it does only exist as a package). Still it is the best option available, since it is portable in Windows, Linux and Mac.

There are other efforts, such as XWT, which would be great, but unfortunately don't know about its maturity or even whether it has been abandoned. Other toolkits are ETO, but they are not suited for your needs.
