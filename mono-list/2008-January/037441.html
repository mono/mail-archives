<PRE>William Lahti escribi&#243;:
&gt;<i> 'm happy to announce that we have released version 0.0.1 of SharpOS,
</I>&gt;<i> including our AOT compiler and a basic kernel with an interactive
</I>&gt;<i> shell. This is a proof of concept release intended to gather
</I>&gt;<i> awareness, support and participation from community members, so if you
</I>&gt;<i> are interested in working on this project we encourage you to sign up
</I>&gt;<i> for our mailing list. For those of you who don't know about SharpOS,
</I>&gt;<i> it is a project to write an operating system purely in C#, which was
</I>&gt;<i> actually spawned from the &quot;Operating system in C#&quot; thread on
</I>&gt;<i> mono-devel-list. Although we don't have object instantiation or meta
</I>&gt;<i> data embedding in our kernel yet, the release proves clearly that the
</I>&gt;<i> concept is possible. Our next milestone focuses on supporting managed
</I>&gt;<i> code in the kernel, as well as using that managed code to improve our
</I>&gt;<i> current systems as much as possible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Our wiki and project management suite is at <A HREF="http://sharpos.org/.">http://sharpos.org/.</A>  Our
</I>&gt;<i> file releases area at SourceForge
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/platformdownload.php?group_id=196652">http://sourceforge.net/project/platformdownload.php?group_id=196652</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> contains tarballs and zips with source code, binaries, and disk images
</I>&gt;<i> for testing. We've also got ISO images for trying SharpOS on real
</I>&gt;<i> computers (that don't have floppy drives, that is), as well as the
</I>&gt;<i> usual configurations for Bochs, VMWare, and Virtual PC.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And have a wonderful new year everyone!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PS: I've had a lot of trouble posting to the list because Postfix says
</I>&gt;<i> the dates on the email are in the future??
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I'm curious, do you have rough numbers about performance loss compared 
to a non-managed OS like Linux (I guess the difference is huge right 
now, but what do you think you can reach if it begins to get optimized?).

BTW, does this approach have the advantage of a micro-kernel safe 
approach or is it only safe from the point of view of memory leaks 
(thanks to the garbage collector)?

Thanks in advance, and congratulations for this great project.
