To which MySQL provider version have you downgrade?

Please try to get a proper GDB backtrace. See

<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Debugging#Debugging_with_GDB">http://www.mono-project.com/Debugging#Debugging_with_GDB</A>

You should attach GDB as root to the mono process of mod-mono-server.

Additionally, you may want to give mod_mono &amp; XSP from SVN a try.
The latest version is able to limit the rate of parallel requests
made to mod-mono-server. This helps keeping your web server healthy
and there are chances that it's also fixing the problems you've
encountered.
