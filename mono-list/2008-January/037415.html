<PRE>'m happy to announce that we have released version 0.0.1 of SharpOS,
including our AOT compiler and a basic kernel with an interactive
shell. This is a proof of concept release intended to gather
awareness, support and participation from community members, so if you
are interested in working on this project we encourage you to sign up
for our mailing list. For those of you who don't know about SharpOS,
it is a project to write an operating system purely in C#, which was
actually spawned from the &quot;Operating system in C#&quot; thread on
mono-devel-list. Although we don't have object instantiation or meta
data embedding in our kernel yet, the release proves clearly that the
concept is possible. Our next milestone focuses on supporting managed
code in the kernel, as well as using that managed code to improve our
current systems as much as possible.

Our wiki and project management suite is at <A HREF="http://sharpos.org/.">http://sharpos.org/.</A>  Our
file releases area at SourceForge
(<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/platformdownload.php?group_id=196652">http://sourceforge.net/project/platformdownload.php?group_id=196652</A>)
contains tarballs and zips with source code, binaries, and disk images
for testing. We've also got ISO images for trying SharpOS on real
computers (that don't have floppy drives, that is), as well as the
usual configurations for Bochs, VMWare, and Virtual PC.

And have a wonderful new year everyone!

PS: I've had a lot of trouble posting to the list because Postfix says
the dates on the email are in the future??
