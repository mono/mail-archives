It was too large for the list, like I feared (which was why I gave  
the bandwidth-saving &quot;recipe&quot; in the first place), and was  
subsequently rejected by the list admin. I did cc you though and  
recently already inquired whether you received it. Did you check your  
spam filter? Will re-send it anyway.
