<PRE>Hi,

 

MySQL Connector/Net 1.0.8 RC has been released.  MySQL Connector/Net is an
all-managed ADO.Net provider for MySQL.  While this release is suitable for
any version of MySQL, it is strongly encouraged that this release not be
used on any production data.  

 

** IMPORTANT **

We are making this release available as an RC because there were significant
changes made to the provider beyond just simple bug fixes.  Due to this, we
felt it prudent to ask for feedback from the community before declaring the
provider safe for production use.  We plan to release the next version
(1.0.9) as GA within the next 2-3 weeks incorporating any feedback we get
from the community.

** IMPORTANT **

 

It is now available in source and binary form from the Connector/Net
download pages at <A HREF="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/1.0.html">http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/1.0.html</A> and
mirror sites (note that not all mirror sites may be up to date at this point
of time - if you can't find this version on some mirror, please try again
later or choose another download site.)

 

This release includes many bug fixes along with the following
enhancements/changes:

 

* Implemented a stored procedure cache.  By default, the connector caches
the metadata for the last 25    procedures that are seen.  You can change
the number of procedures that are cached by using the 'procedure
cache=&lt;size&gt;' connection string setting.  You can disable the procedure
cache by setting a zero size.

 

* Executing stored procedures now no longer requires the user to have select
privileges on the mysql.proc table.

 

* Shared memory connections now work as expected.

 

* Queries containing a large number of parameters now run many times faster
than before.  As an example of the performance gains seen, an internal
testing app that needed more than 30 minutes to execute using 1.0.7,
completes in less than 8 seconds using 1.0.8.

 

* We are no longer providing binaries compiled with .NET 1.0.  We are doing
this for a couple of reasons.  First, we believe the vast majority of our
users are using .NET 1.1 or 2.0.  Also, removing .NET 1.0 binaries reduces
the number of frameworks we have to test thereby reducing the time it takes
to verify releases.  If 1.0 is needed by a sufficiently large number of
users, we are willing to re-evaluate this decision.

 

* ICSharpCode ZipLib is no longer used by the connector and is no longer
being distributed with it.

 

The installer for this release installs the assembly into the Global
Assembly Cache (GAC) without giving you an option to not do this.  In the GA
release (1.0.9), the installer will include an option to not register the
provider in the GAC.  

 

Also, the installer attempts to install both 1.1 and 2.0 binaries into the
respective GAC.  If you do not have both frameworks installed, the installer
will give an error.  This will be fixed in the final product but for now you
can work around this by doing a custom install and choosing the version of
the driver for the framework you want to install. 

 

Thank you for checking out this release of Connector/Net.  

 

-Reggie
