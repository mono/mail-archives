<PRE>
For a particular customer, I want to deploy an existing C# app to
Windows XP hosts. This deployment is to occur via the web, and it must
occur &quot;quickly&quot;. The size of the compiled app assembly is several
hundred Kb. All required classes are known at compile-time.

I cannot force the end-user to install .NET - it will take too long.
Microsoft has confirmed that .NET was not bundled with XP, so I cannot
rely on it &quot;already being there&quot;.

Hence I am investigating mono. I want to use it to compile the C#, and
then deploy something less bulky than .NET in order to run on the
end-user hosts.

I searched all the available documentation, and the only deployment
instructions I find are:

	1. install mono on the target host
	2. use mkbundle

1 is unacceptable - for the same reasons that we cannot force an
installation .NET.

2 is listed in the documentation as being available only on linux.

So would someone please answer the following:

1. What is the minimum runtime file-set required in order to run a mono
app on a &quot;clean&quot; host?
2. Can mkbundle be used for a windows target?

Thank you in advance for any assistance offered.
