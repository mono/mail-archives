<PRE>Hi!
I think that this is a big step.
Maybe the best way to fund Mono is to involve major corporations in it. 
It is difficult because a lot of them just think in .Net/Java rather
than Mono, so a Mono Foundation might be a big step promoting Mono.
With good free software projects into the Mono Foundation many companies
might be interested in Mono. To talk with &quot;N*&quot; project maintainers like
NLog, NHibernate... to welcome them to the Mono Foundation might be a
hit.
I think that using the Apache Foundation as the host is not a good idea
because people thinks in Java when they read &quot;Apache Foundation&quot; but I
don't know how much cost to setup up a new foundation.
Im a volunteer to help in the Mono Foundation :-)
Regards

&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Over the past few years, people have suggested that we should create
</I>&gt;<i> a foundation to further develop Mono.  The idea in general is good, it
</I>&gt;<i> has worked fairly well for Gnome, and has worked fairly well for
</I>&gt;<i> Apache.    
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     This comes at a time when some third parties would like to see Mono
</I>&gt;<i> developed in a particular direction and the process that we have at
</I>&gt;<i> Novell for getting paid for Mono is not optimal (which is to say, today
</I>&gt;<i> the best thing you can do to fund Mono is buy SUSE, which is not a very
</I>&gt;<i> direct way of funding Mono). 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     But am not sure that everyone has the same idea about what a Mono
</I>&gt;<i> foundation would do, I would like such a foundation to be a mechanism to
</I>&gt;<i> funnel more money into the development of Mono and its ecosystem.   
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     A foundation might have other uses, as it does in Gnome and Apache
</I>&gt;<i> cases (defining release schedules, promotion, opening up the decision
</I>&gt;<i> making process), but I think that fundamentally it should aim to have a
</I>&gt;<i> budget that it can use to hire developers to work on particular areas
</I>&gt;<i> that need to be developed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     I think this is a topic that is worth discussing at the upcoming
</I>&gt;<i> Mono Meeting: are there enough companies that would be willing to fund a
</I>&gt;<i> non-profit to develop open source software for this particular purpose?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     A few months ago, just when someone had brought up the idea about a
</I>&gt;<i> Mono Foundation, I happened to run into Greg Stein from Apache at a
</I>&gt;<i> conference.  He had a few comments: setting up a foundation is a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> work (I agree);  it might be best to reuse an existing foundation (I
</I>&gt;<i> agree as well);   The Apache Foundation *might* be a host for our
</I>&gt;<i> activities, but does not have a mechanism for paying/funding any
</I>&gt;<i> activities (which is what I would personally like to see happen). 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Miguel.
