<PRE>Hey,

Nice resume.

You should take the time to check out Gendarme from SVN. It's worth it
and, by looking at the file names, would quickly answer your question.

&lt;spoiler&gt;The .sln and .csproj files in Gendarme SVN (and source tarball)
aren't fakes&lt;/spoiler&gt;

&gt;<i> Some portability rules would be:
</I>&gt;<i>   - Calling methods that do not exist in Mono (useful for seeing what 
</I>&gt;<i> 2.0 features you use that mono does not have yet)
</I>&gt;<i>   - Calling methods that are marked with [MonoTODO]
</I>&gt;<i>   - Calling methods that throw a NotSupportedException
</I>
This is (well should be) all the same rule. We need to extract those
information in a file (e.g. once by Mono release) which would be easy
using (again) Cecil. Then have a (Gendarme) rule to check all (e.g.
direct, virtual, interfaces...) calls made by an assembly against the
file.

Obviously you can run Gendarme (or a custom runner) with a single rule
on a set of assemblies (e.g. all assemblies in a solution) but it may be
more complex to implement for web projects (e.g. aspx pages).

&gt;<i> Ideally, this would exist in the above VS plugin.  At the very least, it 
</I>&gt;<i> should produce a report listing the errors.  
</I>
This is exactly what Gendarme does (see my blog in my signature for a,
albeit old, sample). It's also one of the reason to re-use Gendarme for
this task.

&gt;<i> More advanced, and if 
</I>&gt;<i> possible, some sort of integration to take you directly to places in 
</I>&gt;<i> your source code, or mark them as warnings on compile.
</I>
This has been discussed in the mono-devel mailing list, look for subject
with &quot;Gendarme&quot; inside, as this is a new feature (mdb/pdb support) being
implemented in Cecil.

...

&gt;<i> I think one of the most important things I came away from the meeting is 
</I>&gt;<i> Miguel's sincere commitment to courting Windows developers for Mono.  
</I>&gt;<i> However, I think there are roughly zero (?) Windows developers on the

</I>
Thanks. I (and a few others) will take that as a compliment ;-)

Not that I ever considered myself a &quot;insert any registered trademark&quot;
developer but I admit I still have the 2 *pre-release* volumes of
&quot;Microsoft Win32 Application Programming Interfaces&quot;. OTOH I don't
recall all the OS names I've written software for... (embedded systems
are great for 404)

Anyway it does prove that Windows developers can learn new tricks
too ;-)

&gt;<i> so they don't really know the way Windows developers work 
</I>&gt;<i> and how they expect things to work.  
</I>
Keeping with Pareto's rule, I guess this is part your 20% wrong, 80% of
the time (which is, obviously, an abuse of language ;-)

Knowing the way, or expectations, is one thing but making it a &quot;perfect
fit&quot; is quite another. This gets even less trivial with limited
man-power and other priorities in Mono (and that's not limited to
Novell!). I think we should be looking at an intermediate (do I dare say
&quot;good enough&quot; ?) step(s) - which are much less obvious that a &quot;perfect&quot;
solution would be.

&gt;<i> They were very actively seeking 
</I>&gt;<i> feedback from Windows developers.  The above is a start.  
</I>
If you're keeping a list (which I guess should be in the wiki) then
please add the &quot;#@%^@$# cygwin build dependency&quot; to build Mono and
execute it's test suite.

&gt;<i> Please be sure to add yours!
</I>
Yes, please do!
