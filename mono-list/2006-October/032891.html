<PRE>I don't particularly think that my vote carries much weight.. but I
would personally like the apache name behind Mono and historically the
apache foundation has done a good job of not getting in the way. With
regards to paying for development, I don't see the apache foundation as
being a hindrance; hard to implement tasks will still require an
interested party to finance the development.I don't know of any
non-profits out there (maybe the eclipse foundation) that are paying for
hard core dev work. 

my 2 cents,

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     A foundation might have other uses, as it does in Gnome and Apache

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     I think this is a topic that is worth discussing at the upcoming
</I>&gt;<i> Mono Meeting: are there enough companies that would be willing to fund a
</I>&gt;<i> non-profit to develop open source software for this particular purpose?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     A few months ago, just when someone had brought up the idea about a
</I>&gt;<i> Mono Foundation, I happened to run into Greg Stein from Apache at a
</I>&gt;<i> conference.  He had a few comments: setting up a foundation is a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> work (I agree);  it might be best to reuse an existing foundation (I
</I>&gt;<i> agree as well);   The Apache Foundation *might* be a host for our
</I>&gt;<i> activities, but does not have a mechanism for paying/funding any
</I>&gt;<i> activities (which is what I would personally like to see happen).
