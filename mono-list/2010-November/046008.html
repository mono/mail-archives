Hi Folks,

I have been tasked with &quot;modernizing&quot; a complex, distributed application.
Part of that modernization involves discarding a proprietary TCP/IP-based
messaging protocol and, in its stead, using Web Services.

As a proof of concept, I am considering taking a very small part of the
application and writing a WS version thereof. For the sake of discussion I
would describe the current implementation of this part as follows:

a. UI on nodeA connects to an inetd-like process on nodeB, asking this
process to start another process,   
    let's call it a &quot;filesystem browser.&quot;
b. the inetd-like process launches the filesystem browser and hands off the
connection to the UI
c. the UI can now obtain and display the contents of nodeB's filesystem.
Note that the UI uses a dll that implements the aforementioned proprietary
messaging.

Part of this POC is to not completely rewrite the application. The intent is
to preserve, where possible, the existing application code and to replace
only the plumbing. My current thinking is to realize this functionality via
.Net as follows:

1. Build the fileystem browser as a .dll (it is presently an .exe)
2. Implement the inetd-like process as a Web Service &quot;wrapper&quot; around this
dll (interop implicated here)
3. Replace the client-side messaging dll with a .Net dll that offers the
same entry points as the original dll.
4. This .Net dll would function as a client to the Web Service.

So the new implementation, at least its steady-state, would look something
like this:

i.  UI sends a proprietary message to nodeB by calling into the new client
dll of step 3. 
ii.  client dll sends this propriety message via MTOM to the Web Service
wrapper at nodeB
iii. Web Service at nodeB makes an interop call to the dll version of the
.exe file of step 1, passing the proprietary message to the same code that
has always processed this message.
iv. data returned by the dll, perhaps including a reply message, is returned
by the Web Service to the 
    client, thence to the UI

That's about as far as I've gotten. Some questions:

A. Does this seem a reasonable approach to this POC?
B. Will the use of interop lend itself to Mono? I have read the FAQs and see
that there seems to be pretty 
    robust support for interop.
C. Will the use of WCF lend itself to Mono?

I try to evangelize for .Net but am routinely and reflexively shot down
because of a perceived lack of *nix support. This is my first foray into the
Mono world and alot depends on it.

At any rate, I would be most grateful if folks who have dealt with similar
problems, or those who simply can shed some light on such a matter, would
offer their opinions.

Thank you.
