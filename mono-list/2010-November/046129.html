C++/CLI that is not /clr:pure is not supported by mono on any platform.

&gt;<i> My initial thoughts on a plan for porting the code:
</I>&gt;<i>       * If available replace each p/invoke to a Win32 API with a call

</I>
Doubtful; if you could do that, then there'd likely be a .NET method you
could be using already (in which case, wouldn't you already be using
it?).

&gt;<i>       * If not available I plan to leave the p/invoke in place and
</I>&gt;<i>         build a platform specific native library (.dylib on OS X)
</I>&gt;<i>         providing similar functionality with the same signature.
</I>
A slight variation, there's:

        <A HREF="http://mono-project.com/DllMap">http://mono-project.com/DllMap</A>

This allows you to change the native library name and the function
names, as long as the functions have identical signatures...

&gt;<i>       * Stub out or #ifdef out the code entirely. (For example the
</I>&gt;<i>         code that ties in to Windows event logging is not essential
</I>&gt;<i>         functionality.)
</I>
Generally not ideal, as it means you need to do multiple builds for each
platform.

Then there's option 4: Runtime platform checks:

        static readonly bool IsWinApi = Path.DirectorySepartorChar == '\
        \';
        /* ... */
        if (IsWinApi)
                CallWinApiMethod ();
        else
                DoSomethingElse();

Runtime checks are generally preferred.

&gt;<i> My initial thoughts on a strategy for porting the code:
</I>&gt;<i>       * Port this library to Mono on Windows
</I>
Good first step.

&gt;<i>       * Port it to Mono on WINE on non-Windows platforms
</I>
Skip.

&gt;<i>       * Port it to Mono on non-Windows platforms
</I>
Good idea.

&gt;<i> My questions:
</I>&gt;<i>      1. Can Mono on Windows run managed C++ code?
</I>
I do not think so, unless the C++/CLI code is compiled as /clr:pure.

&gt;<i>      1. Assuming the managed C++ code makes no platform specific
</I>&gt;<i>         calls, is clean for 32/64 bit architectures, clean for bit
</I>&gt;<i>         endianness could it be recompiled can Mono on non-Windows
</I>&gt;<i>         platforms run managed C++ code?
</I>
Again, is it compiled as /clr:pure?  If it is, it should run; if it
isn't, it won't run.

&gt;<i>      1. Would porting to Mono on WINE on OS X as an intermediate step
</I>&gt;<i>         be worth the effort?
</I>
No.

&gt;<i>      1. Is there a better or alternative porting strategy that you
</I>&gt;<i>         would recommend?
</I>
No.
