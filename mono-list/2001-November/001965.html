<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>My opinion (which isn't necessarily right!) is that the author is rather
obsessed with java! He doesn't believe that there can be any circumstances
where it isn't the ideal language. If you write a small program to run on
clients old, slow machines, it will almost certainly run faster in C or even
VB than written in java, and they may not even have JVM. The costs involved
in renting space on a shared web server are far less with languages such as
php or perl compared with java.

Surely an article like this would be better written by someone with a
neutral viewpoint!

I think he sees projects such as Mono, .NET, and .GNU as a threat to java,
and himself! Surely if java was so good then it will fight the battle for
itself! People aren't going to move from java to .NET or Mono just because
other people say .Net/Mono is good! If they do, then they will either find
it to be a bad experience and will return to java, or will find it to be an
improvement, and stay away from java, in that case with good reasons!

Daniel.
