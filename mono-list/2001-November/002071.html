<PRE>Hey guys,

   Just as an update and a clarification.  I think that adding a `_'
keyword is an idea worth submitting to ECMA, and if they decide to
include this on the long run, it could be used [1].

   But we will not develop a non-compliant C# compiler, we want to allow
developers to use the compiler they like the most (Microsoft, Mono,
Portable.NET) and be able to move freely from one to another.  It would
be bad for users.  We have to stick to the standards.  And if the
standards are insufficient, we should examine the avenues to get
improvements into the standards. 

   As someone pointed out: locking people into one particular compiler
is not really going to achieve much more than upset developers at this
point.

   That being said, the proposal is interesting to get ideas moving in
this particular direction.  Already some good ideas have been posted to
the list and we should continue the discussion.

Miguel.

[1] that is, if we still think it is a good idea, and no other solutions
are available, but I see quite many good ideas being posted that it
seems we will have a nice system.
