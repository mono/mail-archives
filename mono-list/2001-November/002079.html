<PRE>I agree. It ruins the entire point of Mono if you start making it not work
with anything else that is .NET. I thought the reason of Mono was to create
an Open Source implementation of a universal standard we know will succeed.
Sure, there are many other (possibly better) ways to do what .NET does...
but they don't have Microsoft's marketting behind them, do they?


That's why Microsoft is where they are today. They have good business minds.
Like they said... Bill Gates won't be remembered for technical
innovations... but for being a good businessman.



And could someone please come over here and slam the simple concept that I
must send messages to
<A HREF="mailto:mono-list@ximian.com">mono-list@ximian.com</A> and not hit reply.... before I make a fool of myself
yet again by sending messages to only the author and not the message list...
grahhhh

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; why OpenSource project couldn't be creative ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; why not submit your idea to the ECMA ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well given that a lot of inital anxiety on this list revolved
</I>&gt;<i> around whether
</I>&gt;<i> MS would get &quot;creative&quot; with the ECMA spec... yes I think it
</I>&gt;<i> would be a bad
</I>&gt;<i> thing for an OpenSource to get creative in such a fashion. Note
</I>&gt;<i> this doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> preclude creativity, just when creativity means moving at a tangent to a
</I>&gt;<i> standard.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One can't lambast MS for it's historic abuse of specs and then behave in a
</I>&gt;<i> like fashion... well one can but it's normally called hypocrasy... again
</I>&gt;<i> this is based upon the assumption that my reading of the proposal is
</I>&gt;<i> correct, if it isn't I'll be glad to be corrected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By all means submit the idea to the ECMA, and if it gets rolled into the
</I>&gt;<i> spec use it. If it doesn't, don't.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Stick to the spec. If you don't intend to stick to the spec then
</I>&gt;<i> there's no
</I>&gt;<i> point for a large section of developers to even monitor this project. If
</I>&gt;<i> Mono isn't going to allow me to compile my C# (core libs, I appreciate the
</I>&gt;<i> need for clear distinct interfaces for things like GUI components) as per
</I>&gt;<i> spec on Linux, that I have quite probably developed under VisualStudio.NET
</I>&gt;<i> then there's nothing here for me, and I'm not likely to bother redeploying
</I>&gt;<i> applications from Windows to Gnome.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Adding a non-spec keyword is not a small thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>     Guy.
