To be clear, Gtk# has a run-time dependency on gtk+.  There is no
compile time dependency because it uses pinvoke to access gtk+.  I am
making an effort to keep it compiling on win32+cygwin.  I build prior to
checkin on a Win98 vmware instance, so if anyone detects build breakage
on win2k, I'd like to know details, preferably posted to
<A HREF="mailto:gtk-sharp-list@ximian.com.">gtk-sharp-list@ximian.com.</A>  

Based on the above description, it sounds like you have some larger
environmental issues, since it is unlikely all of the above builds would
be simultaneously broken. It will be difficult to help get to the bottom
of them without access to better problem descriptions than &quot;won't
compile.&quot; There are some frequently asked build failure resolutions that
can be looked up in the list archives.  glib is one of the most
frequently failed builds, for example, and the archives have numerous
references to a patch to fix it.  

Feel free to contact me directly or on the list with more detailed build
output, and I'd be happy to help you work through them.

Mike
