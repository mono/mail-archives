<PRE>Jason

Thanks for detailed reply.  Please see my verbage below...

&gt;<i> So anyhow, where I feel he's wrong is:
</I>&gt;<i> 1.) Passport is the real problem, and pressure needs to be applied so that
</I>&gt;<i> this doesn't turn into fiasco so big people will wish for the days with
</I>&gt;<i> InterNIC bungled and abused their DNS rights.
</I>
M$ will use PInvoke to tie apps to MS.NET in the name of
increased performance.  They will figure out a way to
tie apps to Passport too.  (Think IE only web sites.)

I think author's point was 
Passport won't be unavoidable so give up now.

&gt;<i> 2.) Java is not appropriate for all tasks. Neither is .net for that matter.
</I>&gt;<i> But what we do need is a loosely coupled platform where different language
</I>&gt;<i> technology's are allowed to interact as much as possible. .net doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> wholely solve that problem, but it definately steps in the right way. We
</I>&gt;<i> should not throw that baby out with the Passport bathwater.
</I>
I'm not an expert but I believe there *already* exists compilers
that compile lots of languages to the Java Virtual Machine.
J2EE/EJB won't tie people to Java anymore than .NET/Mono for
this reason.  I believe author wants us to win the war over
the web services infrastructure first. 
After that battle is won we can work on secondary battle of 
adding JVM compilers for all languages and making Open Source
clones of JVM, Java libraries and other Java-isms.

Chris
