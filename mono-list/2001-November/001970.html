Right.
    But I guess it's all valid till we don't use the code in the same =
form as it is.

    Unless we use the code as given by M$, we should be in a position to =
defend our project. And as far as I recall, there's no restriction over =
decompilation using ILDasm or otherwise to decompile their code. My view =
is - unless we duplicate their code, it should be no harm to us, I mean =
the project. I have included the &quot;ToU&quot; - Terms of Use - from the M$ site =
under the .NET downloads category where nothing is mentioned about =
decompilations and the related stuff.

    All of your views in this matter would be welcome. It is of high =
priority I think.

NB: I am forwarding the mail to the list to have their opinion over this =
matter.

Cheers,
Gaurav Vaish
