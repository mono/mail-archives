<PRE>I have not looked much into XSP. I'll have a look.
What I was planing on doing is a mod_mono for allowing server extentions
written with mono. The rest of ASP.NET was designed to be in a class lib
and not to depend on a webserver, so that project can be seperate from
mod_mono. mod_mono can be shared between an ASP.NET implementation, and an
XSP implementation. Another thing that might help to get XSP on mono would
be to create a java compiler like Microsoft is doing with their new
j++.net project. Create a java class lib that wrap the .net ones. It then
would be posible to compile java programs for use with mono without code
changes.

</I>&gt;<i> I've looked at both ASP.NET and XSP, and superficially, I can see only
</I>&gt;<i> four key differences.
</I>&gt;<i> 1) While both JVM and ASP.NET support multiple languages, ASP.NET
</I>&gt;<i>    supports them through the CLR while XSP supports them through
</I>&gt;<i>    through the Bean Scripting Framework:
</I>&gt;<i>       <A HREF="http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/projects/bsf">http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/projects/bsf</A>
</I>&gt;<i>    and through the Windows scripting interface (if you're on Windows).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) The reference implementation of XSP, Cocoon, doesn't seem to allow
</I>&gt;<i>    compiled web pages like ASP.NET does. XSP pages should thus be
</I>&gt;<i>    slower.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) XSP is undergoing W3 standardization whereas ASP.NET get's enhanced
</I>&gt;<i>    at Microsoft's whim.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Through Visual Studio.NET, ASP.NET implements a really nice drag and
</I>&gt;<i>    drop tool for creating ASP.NET pages. No such tool exists for XSP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In all other ways, each seems to have features that available in the
</I>&gt;<i> other.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's go through these items one at a time.
</I>&gt;<i> 1) This seems to be a limitation of the current reference
</I>&gt;<i>    implementation, Cocoon. There's no reason Cocoon couldn't be
</I>&gt;<i>    rewritten for the CLR. Since Java an C# are so similar,
</I>&gt;<i>    reimplementing Cocoon in the C# will be a lot easier than
</I>&gt;<i>    reverse engineering ASP.NET. I know that OpenASP was created
</I>&gt;<i>    once, but I can't find any source code to it now, so
</I>&gt;<i>    there's little code or design that can be reused to reimplement
</I>&gt;<i>    ASP.NET.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) This seems to be a limitation of the current reference
</I>&gt;<i>    implementation. The Apache group is working on Cocoon2 that gets
</I>&gt;<i>    rid of many of the limitations of XSP, but I don't think they've
</I>&gt;<i>    fixed this. Personally, I don't see why it's impossible to create
</I>&gt;<i>    XSLT transformations on XSP to translate XSP pages into CLR code.
</I>&gt;<i>    Even if XSLT can't handle the job, GSP (<A HREF="http://gsp.sourceforge.net">http://gsp.sourceforge.net</A>)
</I>&gt;<i>    is proof of concept that precompiling HTML (and thus XML) pages to
</I>&gt;<i>    any language as either CGI or an Apache/IIS extension is possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) This means XSP is easier to implement than ASP.NET. My fear is that
</I>&gt;<i>    ASP.NET for Mono developers would be in a Samba-like/WINE-like
</I>&gt;<i>    situation of chasing moving target that's not under the control of
</I>&gt;<i>    free software or at least some standards body. MonoBasic, Gtk#, and
</I>&gt;<i>    ECMA C# &amp; CLR aren't exposed as much to these problems because the
</I>&gt;<i>    success of these projects isn't determined by one a single company's
</I>&gt;<i>    whims.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) This is a tough one. It should be possible to write an ASP.NET to XSP
</I>&gt;<i>    translator so XSP pages could indirectly be made in Visual
</I>&gt;<i>    Studio.NET, but this is clearly a big kludge. The real solution to
</I>&gt;<i>    enhance SharpDevelop so it handles XSP pages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have been planning to work on some sort of C# support for XSP (using
</I>&gt;<i> the GSP approach), but unfortunately because of unforseen
</I>&gt;<i> circumstances, I won't be able to do much beyond research before next
</I>&gt;<i> February.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please take a look at XSP. If you need any more information, let me know.
