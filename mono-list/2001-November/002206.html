<PRE>&gt;<i>From: &quot;Veronica&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:veron78@interfree.it">veron78@interfree.it</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>Subject: [Mono-list] Hi , can someone get me on the right way?
</I>
&gt;<i>There is some docs about the projects itself? Where i can learn how the 
</I>&gt;<i>parts of project are related and the meaning of all stuff i downloaded?( 
</I>&gt;<i>for instance what is gtk-csharp? it won't compile under win2k+cygwin ; also 
</I>&gt;<i>glib and mono won't compile )
</I>
gtk-sharp, depends on gtk (a graphic toolkit), normally available in Linux, 
but there´s a version that can be installed on Windows and used by Cygwin 
programs I believe.

aside from the compiler (mcs), most of the other target are meant to be 
build for Linux, just now, in a near future we hope to have it running on 
both platforms.

&gt;<i>There are some thing i do not understand  : on witch base i must build some 
</I>&gt;<i>class libraries? These libraries are written in
</I>&gt;<i>C#  as i see : why not in IL ?
</I>
Using IL, which is assembler like, is just too hard and wouldn´t bring any 
benefit over compiled languages. Any .NET language will do a good job, for 
most classes, and C# has all the features to make even the most complex 
classes a breeze to program.

&gt;<i>How we can use the underlying services of the operating system if we work 
</I>&gt;<i>within a naked CLR machine?
</I>
By a naked CLR machine you the mean the runtime in the interpreter or 
jitter? Some opcodes make calling the base OS functionality possible. It´s 
called a PInvoke (short form Platform Invoke), so you build some basic 
objects just by calling functions on a native DLL or Shared Library(.so), 
directly from C#/VB.NET (it´s like using DECLARE FUNCTION/SUB on VB6)
