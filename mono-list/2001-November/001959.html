<PRE>As some of you know, with Cygwin 1.3.3 they deprecated the &quot;//&quot; method of
referring to your drives. The proper way is now /cygdrive/driveletter
(/cygdrive/c, etc.). This needs to be considered in the makefiles where some
folks are still using &quot;//&quot; as part of the ROOT variable and causes builds to
fail on newer cygwin. I totally respect that some people don't need or want
to update to the newest cygwin, and it works for them just fine, but for new
people joining the project on the Windows side it might be a bit confusing.

Also, the snapshot from last night doesn't want to build, giving errors on
the System.Drawing test &quot;TestPoint.cs&quot;. I'm very new to this, but it doesn't
seem like it is referencing the NUnitcore.dll in any build files, and nant
reports that it can't find NUnit.

Hope this info is useful!
