<PRE>&gt;<i> As for bringing the fruits of Unix internationalisation to .NET, are you
</I>&gt;<i> porting .NET or redesigning it?... I speak with specific regard to the
</I>&gt;<i> spec.... there's a .NET way of doing internationalisation, and that's the
</I>&gt;<i> one that matters in this case. Some of the .NET methodologies will be better
</I>&gt;<i> than others when compaired to other frameworks... but if you start
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;improving&quot; .NET beyond it's spec what'll you'll end up with won't be .NET
</I>
Maybe you missed the bit in which we discussed `_' being an internal
method, which means that this never gets exposed to use applications?

&gt;<i> Does .NET perhaps have a Windows bias... yes of course it does considering
</I>&gt;<i> its background... but you knew that before you started to impliment it. You
</I>&gt;<i> seek to remove the Windows bias, and it will no longer be .NET
</I>
Implementing a .NET clone does not mean that you dont have some room for
improvement, and the case for an *internal* method using *internal*
classes seems to be such a place.  It wont affect users, it wont affect
programmers, it will only simplify the life of those working actively in
the class libraries.

Miguel.
