<PRE>&gt;<i> It's probably my windows-centric background but I find it hard to see what
</I>&gt;<i> the problem is with gettext (&quot;....&quot;); ...certainly I don't see a problem
</I>&gt;<i> with the verbosity of this operation that I don't see to a greater degree
</I>&gt;<i> elsewhere.
</I>
Well, it would actually have to be something like:

	System.Globalization.GetText (&quot;String&quot;);

Which is a lot to type ;-)

&gt;<i> One could equally address the verbosity of the StringBuilder class or a
</I>&gt;<i> dozen other cases.
</I>
I barely use StringBuilder myself, I most of the time depend on the
overloaded string operator + ;-)

&gt;<i> MS now has a reasonable degree of experience in producing RAD frameworks
</I>&gt;<i> from VB... now I hate VB, and the next chap may think Delphi is far
</I>&gt;<i> superior, but I think that the .NET class framework show's considerable
</I>&gt;<i> thought and effort toward a consistent, clear framework.... we should maybe
</I>&gt;<i> try and stay inline with the ethos of the framework.
</I>
My take is that in the Unix world we do have enjoyed of better designed
tools for internationalization for some time.  We would like to bring
this to .NET.

Miguel.
