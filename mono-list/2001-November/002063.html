<PRE>Personally, I think Tag-Based approach is better. Messages tend to be
changed often, whereas tags are stable, and if you want to change (English)
message with String-Based approach you have to change it twice, in the code
and in the resource table. There are many reasons why changes in the
messages may be introduced - to make it more user-friendly, or simply
correct the spelling (for example, my English is far from ideal ;-)

Introducing new keywords is extremely bad, from my point of view (basically
for the same reasons stated by Guy Murphy above).
To me it looks like sacrificing clarity for ease of typing.
Consider that many people are going to use MS tools and particularly VS.NET
to contribute to Mono.
Also consider end-users. Those people who will use library code to
understand how things work - many people use JDK sources this way. Typically
those people will have very different mindset from C-coders - try to talk
about macro-wrapped gettext merits to Java purists. For example, many Java
people I know have great dislike to anything with underscore symbol :)
It's a different culture, that's it.

That said, I think that using some macro processor or custom preprocessor
tool to implement gettext approach is okay, as long as distributed sources
are in clean standard C#.

Cheers,
Sergey

Subject: [Mono-list] Resource System Proposal


&gt;<i> The string resource handling in .NET is a bit of a pain to use,
</I>&gt;<i> and so I've come up with some alternatives that Mono and
</I>&gt;<i> Portable.NET could use instead.  The aim is to use the same
</I>&gt;<i> system for both projects, rather than inventing two mutually
</I>&gt;<i> incompatible versions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been discussing these ideas with Miguel de Icaza, and
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to get some wider feedback as to what other
</I>&gt;<i> people think.
