That's correct.  Although a clever engine could inline
the calls to those methods within the JIT, and essentially
&quot;bring up&quot; the implementation into the caller.  The final
effect would be the same as the monitorenter/exit opcodes.

&gt;<i> I guess the runtime shall automagically prevent scheduling during native

Not that I'm aware of.  Native methods have the same
synchronisation issues as IL methods.

Behind the scenes, the Enter/Exit methods will eventually
call down to a primitive &quot;acquire monitor&quot; or &quot;release
monitor&quot; service API.  This service API performs all
necessary locking to preserve the atomic nature of
monitor operations.

The JVM calls this API directly in its monitorenter/exit
opcodes.  CLR is one step removed, in that it has an
extra method call layer.  Inlining can remove this layer,
so that a JIT for CLR would produce similar code to
a JIT for the JVM.

I hope this helps.

Cheers,

Rhys.
