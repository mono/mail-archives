<PRE>&gt;<i> Seeing as Intel's done some awfully nice stuff with their OCXT efforts (and
</I>&gt;<i> since, I believe, we've satisfied ourselves as to the legitimacy of using
</I>&gt;<i> the EXMA specs and XML definition to generate/validate code), I'd like to
</I>&gt;<i> get a few of us together to track and actively manage Mono's ECMA
</I>&gt;<i> compliance.
</I>
It would be great if you could identify which classes are available in
OCXT and have not been placed in Mono.   Also, it would be nice to
extract the documentation in the ECMA spec and stick that into the class
libraries.

&gt;<i> I think the first couple of steps would include using Intel's OCXT to
</I>&gt;<i> generate stubs for classes we haven't hit yet, and writing tools to check
</I>&gt;<i> the compliance of classes that we've already written.  Assuming this is a
</I>&gt;<i> good idea, maybe a specific mailing list?
</I>
Yeah, we should write tools to make sure that our API matches the one
from ECMA.

We also need to identify if there are differences between ECMA and
.NET.  If they differ, I would like to give preference to .NET as that
is more likely going to be useful to people. 

If there is an interest in having *both* (and this is dependant upon us
finding whether they differ or not, at this point I dont know)
libraries: one ECMA compliant and one .NET compliant, we could do that
by adding a separate target to our Nant build.

Miguel.
