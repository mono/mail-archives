<PRE>Joel,

Thanks for your detailed response.

&gt;<i> OCXT produces compilable code. See the release notes at
</I>
Unfortunatelly, I still can't test OCXT myself, but I applied my own
codegenerator to the library file found at
<A HREF="http://cedar.intel.com/media/xml/AllTypes.xml">http://cedar.intel.com/media/xml/AllTypes.xml</A>
So far I noticed only one real error in the library file:
Both signatures for System.Type (IL and C#) claims that it extends Object,
whereas it's base class is MemberInfo, this makes overriding DeclaringType &amp;
ReflectedType properties illegal (later in member's signatures).
I downloaded OCL code (ver. 0.2.0), Type extends MemberInfo there (so I
guess it's generated from the older file?).

BTW, I noticed many new methods in the most recent XML library description,
such as Volatile* methods of Thread class.

&gt;<i> RTF should be easy to incorporate into the existing OCXT and I also would
</I>
Just an idea. Maybe it's worth considering rendering documentation in
xsl:fo? Theoretically, this would make it possible to convert it into
different &quot;printable&quot; formats.

Thanks,
Sergey

&gt;<i> Hey Serge, all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Comments below.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;It's very similar to OCXT except for that the main XSLT script is
</I>portable
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;:)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;OCXT scripts are generally not portable, because they use msxsl
</I>&gt;<i> extensions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;I think it's rather unfortunate choice to rely on Office/Word for such a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;tool.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The original intent of the tool that has now become known as OCXT was to
</I>be
&gt;<i> able to generate, from the normative XML definition, the Microsoft Word
</I>&gt;<i> documentation that is being used as an informative annex to the ECMA CLI
</I>&gt;<i> specification. Thus, reliance on Microsoft Word and associated extensions
</I>&gt;<i> seemed warranted. Intel actually decided to use OCXT as a code generation
</I>&gt;<i> tool after the fact and in order to produce auto-generated code as quickly
</I>&gt;<i> as possible, it made sense to modify the already existing tool. Nowadays
</I>the
&gt;<i> code generation is a lot more popular than the documentation generation.
</I>&gt;<i> What I would love to see is OCXT be the tool of choice to produce code as
</I>&gt;<i> well as documentation. And I am not against having the tool be modified in
</I>&gt;<i> order to be more portable and not have to rely on Microsoft Word for the
</I>&gt;<i> code generation...in fact that was the next item I was going to look at.
</I>My
&gt;<i> suggestion is that we consolidate the work of auto generation into OCXT so
</I>&gt;<i> there can be one place to produce code as well as documentation. In other
</I>&gt;<i> words, let's establish some developers on the OCXT site and start
</I>&gt;<i> changing/adding to the tool. What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;The older XML library-definitions have contained some errors that made
</I>it
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;very hard to generate compilable code. I hope this is fixed in the newer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;file.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;The newer format
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;contains more information, but older contains more classes. Some stuff
</I>in
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;the older file is still relevant, mostly values for some enums - it
</I>&gt;<i> appears
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The most recent XML file is what is being submitted to the ECMA General
</I>&gt;<i> Assembly for standardization, so its contents supercedes any of the older
</I>&gt;<i> XML files with respect to ECMA standards compliance. Now you are right
</I>that
&gt;<i> the older XML file may contain other suitable information for the Mono
</I>&gt;<i> project, but that is beyond the scope of ECMA compliance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;If OCXT produces fully compilable code (or newer XML file is fixed)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OCXT produces compilable code. See the release notes at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ocl">http://sourceforge.net/projects/ocl</A> to learn more.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Also, I'd personally would love to see documentation rendered in PDF or
</I>&gt;<i> RTF
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;instead of DOC.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> RTF should be easy to incorporate into the existing OCXT and I also would
</I>&gt;<i> like to see OCXT be able to produce PDF. Another reason to get some
</I>&gt;<i> development on OCXT.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> - Joel Marcey
