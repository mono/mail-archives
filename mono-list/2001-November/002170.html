<PRE>I don't think Mono needs *a* COM+ replacement.

One of the key features of .NET is that it makes multiple self-describing 
object models look and behave almost as if they were native. COM+ and SOAP 
interoperability object models are part of Microsoft's libraries. SOAP can 
be supported since it's a public standard. Supporting COM+ is possible, but 
only on Windows since there's no usable open COM+ implementation yet.

Bonobo's object model is closer to COM+ than DCOP's, so it's probably a 
better choice as a replacement. However it doesn't have to be the only 
option. If you want to implement a DCOP interop library or make Qt bindings 
for C#, I don't think Mono is going to refuse it. I don't think that Mono 
would refuse UNO or XPCOM bindings either.

If you want to get KDErs and Mozilla to support Mono, put it to them this 
way. Mono plus GNOME interop and bindings plus KDE interop and bindings plus 
XPCOM interop plus UNO interop can be the one thing that unifies KDE, GNOME, 
StarOffice, and Mozilla.
