<PRE>Hi Dietmar,

It looks like there are two encoding schemes used within OCL.  In taking a
quick random sample, I found some files encoded as Unicode, while others are
encoded as Western European.  I think the pattern is as follows: classes
that are defined in the ECMA standard are unicode (baselined from output of
the OCXT tool), while additional classes that were added to implement the
standard are Western European (created by our dev environment).  This is
invisible to us in our environment, but we will go through and convert them
all to one encoding.  Are you able to read some files?

For example, I suspect you will be able to read:
System.IO.Stream.cs

but not:
System.IO.StdOutputStream.cs


Thanks for the catch.

Have a nice weekend,
Scott

I am unable to read the source files contained in the package. It seems
they are UTF16 encoded?
