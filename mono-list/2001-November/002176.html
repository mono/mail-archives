<PRE>All,

I'm back on the testing cleanup bandwagon again, this time with
Hashtable.

I thought I would work my way down the tests that had errors and &quot;just
go ahead and fix them.&quot; Ha. The very first one has stumped me for the
past week.

Hashtable has an embedded(?) class that provides the enumerator. It is
simply called &quot;Enumerator.&quot;  Well, as you can see for yourself if you
get the latest from CVS and 'make test' it fails in the constructor for
Enumerator.  I had to play around a bit to find out that it was actually
failing because of a &quot;missing field&quot; called xstr.  Of course, there is a
private field called xstr.  So, I'm not sure what the problem is.

I even took out that field and the one place it was used to see what
would happen.  When I do that, I get the same kind of error, but now
it's complaining about the field &quot;mode.&quot;

Can anyone please help me?

Thanks,
Nick D.
