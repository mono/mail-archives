<PRE>Hello,

I've been away from my email for about a week and a half, and now that
I'm back I see there was a bunch of activity in things that I helped put
together.  I noticed some questions regarding NAnt, the class libraries,
and the platform abstraction layer, but it seems as is some/most have
been otherwise resolved.  If there are any open issues here let me know
and I will help work on them.

I did have my laptop when I was away, and I've made the changes that
were needed on the class libraries to get NUnitConsole to compile
referencing only our corlib.dll and System.dll.  There are a lot of
things that I still need to implement to actually get it working, but
that is what I'll be working on for now.

Glad to see all of the progress that's been made over the past week.

Later,
Sean
