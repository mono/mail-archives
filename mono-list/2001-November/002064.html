</I>
Well given that a lot of inital anxiety on this list revolved around whether
MS would get &quot;creative&quot; with the ECMA spec... yes I think it would be a bad
thing for an OpenSource to get creative in such a fashion. Note this doesn't
preclude creativity, just when creativity means moving at a tangent to a
standard.

One can't lambast MS for it's historic abuse of specs and then behave in a
like fashion... well one can but it's normally called hypocrasy... again
this is based upon the assumption that my reading of the proposal is
correct, if it isn't I'll be glad to be corrected.

By all means submit the idea to the ECMA, and if it gets rolled into the
spec use it. If it doesn't, don't.

Stick to the spec. If you don't intend to stick to the spec then there's no
point for a large section of developers to even monitor this project. If
Mono isn't going to allow me to compile my C# (core libs, I appreciate the
need for clear distinct interfaces for things like GUI components) as per
spec on Linux, that I have quite probably developed under VisualStudio.NET
then there's nothing here for me, and I'm not likely to bother redeploying
applications from Windows to Gnome.

Adding a non-spec keyword is not a small thing.

Cheers,
    Guy.
