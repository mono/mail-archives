<PRE>I'd suggest to check out the NDoc tool (<A HREF="http://ndoc.sourceforge.net">http://ndoc.sourceforge.net</A>)
It's a great tool and has nice integration with NAnt. It would be nice to
maintain the ability to process Mono's docs with NDoc.

Also I don't understand one point.
If we're going to use some GUI tool to facilitate translation, what's the
difference between embedding (English) comments and keeping them in the
separate file.
I mean, suppose we have XML file with the comments extracted from the
library code and one or several files with translations. It's exceptionally
easy for that tool to &quot;merge&quot; both behind the scenes - I mean what's the
difference between splitted out docs and such automated merging.

&gt;<i> GNOME comes with Ukranian translations ;-)
</I>Sure, but there are some funny things I really-really can't explain ;-)
(And, I guess there are more people who speak Ukrainian in Canada than in
the Ukraine :-)

&gt;<i> &gt; The important thing is encoding - what encoding to use.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Many widely-used code editors are not &quot;Unicode-enabled&quot;, moreover some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have problems with anything beyond 7-bit charset.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So maybe it's better to have only English version embedded, and separate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; files with translation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we can take this decision based on whether we should split out
</I>&gt;<i> the documentation out or not.   If we can split out the documentation, I
</I>&gt;<i> would advocate the use of specialized tools that would assist in the
</I>&gt;<i> translation process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Come to think of it, it would be possible for the documentation tool
</I>&gt;<i> *AND* the translation tool to use System.Reflection to extract all the
</I>&gt;<i> public members, and display which ones need documentation to be written
</I>&gt;<i> (something that right now with source code is really hard to do, as we
</I>&gt;<i> have to go manually to each file and verify everything).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A Windows.Forms client could be able to track everything: summary,
</I>&gt;<i> remarks, parameter description for each argument and would also help in
</I>&gt;<i> that people would not have to write the XML strings ever, they will just
</I>&gt;<i> cope with a specialized client that presents the best possible UI to
</I>&gt;<i> document something.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For translation, the tool could use a split display for the original
</I>&gt;<i> english text and the translated text.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't have such experience (moreover, I live in Ukraine, but I can't
</I>even
&gt;<i> &gt; imagine the docs translated to Ukranian, don't ask me why - it's
</I>impossible
&gt;<i> &gt; to explain in English ;-))) - still, I believe localization is very
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; important).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> GNOME comes with Ukranian translations ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Miguel.
