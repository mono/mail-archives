<PRE>&gt;<i> I was also off when I said one per class. This delegate only had to be in 
</I>&gt;<i> any base class. Root-based frameworks, like GTK#, may wish to make the lives 
</I>&gt;<i> of GTK# users easier by declaring this template in their root class (i.e. 
</I>&gt;<i> GObject).
</I>
This makes sense, but Gtk# might not have a lot of strings for
translation

&gt;<i> Admittedly, it would be nice if something GetText-like were accepted into 
</I>&gt;<i> the C# standard (or at least the free software standard). Localization and 
</I>&gt;<i> internationalization should be made as simple, convenient, and manageable as 
</I>&gt;<i> possible. It would happen if every project/library uses it's own scheme.
</I>
We could probably have the delegate defined in our System.Object as an
`internal' call, so at least developers of the Mono class libraries can
use this method.  It would not be exposed to the user applications and
we would remain compatible.

Am I missing something?  Should I go and add the internal _ delegate to
System.Object?
