Sorry, I'm nant-impaired at the moment.  I built that file directly with
csc prior to checkin, but I didn't realise it would be activated in the
nant build by default.  I just checked in a change to the .build file to
exclude the Test dir in the build target for now.

Unfortunately, I'm getting the attached rather cryptic error which stops
my class build in corlib, so I can't verify it at the moment.  Anyone
have any ideas where the logs referenced in this error are written, or
what might be causing this failure?

Thanks,
Mike
