<PRE>&gt;<i> It would be great if you could identify which classes are available in
</I>&gt;<i> OCXT and have not been placed in Mono.   Also, it would be nice to
</I>&gt;<i> extract the documentation in the ECMA spec and stick that into the class
</I>&gt;<i> libraries.
</I>
Yeah, this is where I was planning on starting.  While identifying possible
coverage holes will be pretty trivial, I'm open to any suggestions on an
efficient way to insert the ECMA API docs into existing files.

&gt;<i> We also need to identify if there are differences between ECMA and
</I>&gt;<i> .NET.  If they differ, I would like to give preference to .NET as that
</I>&gt;<i> is more likely going to be useful to people.
</I>
Absolutely.  I think it's probably going to be easier to document MS.NET as
a delta from the ECMA stuff, though.

&gt;<i> If there is an interest in having *both* (and this is dependant upon us
</I>&gt;<i> finding whether they differ or not, at this point I dont know)
</I>&gt;<i> libraries: one ECMA compliant and one .NET compliant, we could do that
</I>&gt;<i> by adding a separate target to our Nant build.
</I>
See comment above.  I have little doubt that the Microsoft versions will
change faster than the ECMA specs, and this seems like it might be a pretty
good idea.
