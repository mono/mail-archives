<PRE>Hey guys,

   I have just checked in a large commit to the CVS that adds calls to
the internal method `System.Globalization.Locale.GetText' in all of
corlib/System.  Other directories are still missing (currently GetText
does nothing, it just returns its argument untouched).

   The patch also changed in corlib/System all the &quot;TODO: implement me&quot;
to throw NotImplementedExceptions, as that is more helpful during
debugging.

   I realize it would have been better to have a method (come to think
of it, I should have done that as suggested on the list, but my brain
had still not engaged into operation).  This would allow people to
&quot;sometimes&quot; ignore problems in the class libraries while they work on
something else, but also has the drawback that it makes debugging of
other pieces of code harder (as people dont know that a function in the
class library is providing us with canned answers).

Miguel
