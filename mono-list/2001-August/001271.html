well, that's good to hear.

that would be a good idea.  it would be much more convenient if the class
libraries were in the mono cvs, instead of over in the mcs tree.  a few simple
programs, and the binaries, along with expected output if the interpreter is
actually working would also be nice for people testing this stuff out.
