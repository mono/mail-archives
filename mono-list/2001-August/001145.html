<PRE>I've seen a lot of people on this list mention how they can't compile their
sources because they're not running windows. I've written a ASP.NET control
that will take a file you give it off your machine, compile it, and show you
the errors and stuff. It works well and will probably be great for people
without access to microsoft's csharp compiler who really need it just to get
small typos out of their code. What'd I'd like to know is:

Is it legal? Miguel could probably answer this best.

How much of an interest is there for this? How many of you still need it?

It needs to run on a win2k iis server w/ .net installed. Does someone have
one? If not, I'll see what I can do, but please offer if you have a house so
we can at least evaluate all the options.

Derek
