i don't consider slashdot posters to be an accurate barometer of much these
days.

&gt;<i> Simply, Mono has an image problem, a trust problem, and dotGNU offers an easy 
</I>&gt;<i> way to fix it. In any case, is/was there any point to the venom in your post, 
</I>
i don't see where you're finding this image problem or trust problem.  there
seem to be a fair number of people willing to contribute to mono right now,
and the fact that there are also people who are working on other, similar
projects doesn't equal an image or trust problem.

&gt;<i> Garrett? Did you disagree with any of my proposals explicitly? Please, let's 
</I>&gt;<i> try to keep this civil, for the good of all involved.
</I>
in retrospect, my post may have been a bit harsh, but i'm somewhat tired of
hearing proposals on how we should structure our development, and would prefer
to simply get back to talking about the actual code.

&gt;<i> Are you saying there would be an active disadvantage to Ximian being a GNU 
</I>&gt;<i> project, rather than one dependent on Ximian? I am, after all, not suggesting 
</I>&gt;<i> for a moment that Ximian have nothing to do with Mono, merely that we state 
</I>&gt;<i> (and act accordingly) that Mono is an integral part of the dotGNU project.
</I>
i don't see the advantage to being a GNU project, so personally i would prefer
things remain as they are.
