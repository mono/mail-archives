this sums up my opinions perfectly.  perhaps these projects will produce code
that they each can use, and perhaps they will each evolve separately into
useful tools that will compete with each other somewhat.  neither of these
things are bad, and either way, we will end up with better tools.

i just think rather than discussing to death the best way to 'avoid
duplication of effort' we should let people work on the projects they wish to
work on, and do so in the manner which they wish.  i'm not saying discussion
of technical similarities and approaches to problems is bad, but if we
immediately assume that the only way to do things is to assimilate everything
into one overarching project, that isn't going to do much other than start
arguments.  imho of course.
