<PRE>&gt;<i> Just out of curiosity, what does the completion column in the class status
</I>&gt;<i> page indicate?  There are several classes that i've noticed which are listed
</I>&gt;<i> as 100 percent complete which have a large number of methods which are not
</I>&gt;<i> implemented (System.Collections.ArrayList is an example, chosen only because
</I>&gt;<i> it happens to be at the top of its page).  If this number means something
</I>&gt;<i> other than 'amount complete', what is it, and if it does mean that, we should
</I>&gt;<i> really look at the classes and make the numbers match reality.
</I>
The completion column is supposed to show completion, but it seems the
data is incorrect.  I do not know how this can be computed by a human
being.  It should be probably computed by a program that matches the
API against the published one.

Should I drop the percentage of completion?

Feel free to update the values in mono/status/class.xml (where this
data actually lives).

Miguel.
