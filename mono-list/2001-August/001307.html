<PRE>Let me bundle in:
Make the regression tool work on .vb files too...

For the compile and test tool what is needed is to call mbas/vbc if it is 
'*.vb'.

For the already-compiled-modules version of the tool problably only being 
carefull about case mismatch will serve both compilers.

Maybe the best idea is to have a XML-based configuration file that matches 
extensions to compilers so that as new languages are added to MS .NET and 
Mono we have an easier job on testing the compilers.

Hey Mono contributors!

    As I start generating code in the C# compiler, I would like to make
sure that our compiler generates correctly all the contract
information.  For example, I want to make sure that our compiler
generates all the visibility flags (public, private, etc), type
arguments, return values, in/out/ref, etc.

    What I want is a small .NET application that takes two executables
or DLL flies on the command line and goes through all the types and
interfaces defined in the assemblies and reports whether there is a
mismatch between them.

    The idea would be that given a test file, I could run it like this:

    verifier --compile test.cs

    That would compile `test.cs' with both Microsoft's C# compiler and
the Mono C# compiler, and then compare the two executables to make
sure that the public interfaces are correct.

    Another option is to run the verified with the pre-compiled
assemblies:

	verified prog1.exe prog2.exe

     This should be a pretty straighforward task.  It can serve as an
excercise in learning System.Reflection and it could also prepare you
to hack on the C# compiler later on as you learn more about how things
work.

Any takers?
Miguel.
