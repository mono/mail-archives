<PRE>Hi Rafael,

&gt;<i> VB6 is organized over multiple types of files (.BAS, .CLS, .FRM, ...)

</I>
	Which is one of the things I need more info on. I have no idea at
all about the file structure in VB.NET, what a sample program would
contain, project files etc.

	I dont have Beta2 and so, can't see this for myself. Could you
please mail me some sample VB.NET project so that I can see (for the first
time!) what the file syntax and everything is ?

	I would be very grateful.


&gt;<i> with a single sintax as C#, besides I don´t know if Bison works well
</I>
	Quite similar to C#, yes.


&gt;<i> with Unicode and C# lex code, therefore I propose to use Jay as Miguel
</I>&gt;<i> and, if he concedes, to start out with its C# grammar and adapt it
</I>
	I agree that we should use Jay because we want C# code to be
generated by the parser-generator and also, because the rest of MonoBasic
shall be written in C# too :-)


&gt;<i> having your Bison Grammar as a guide. I have a two monitor setup that
</I>&gt;<i> comes on handy on those situations.
</I>
	I would say, start with the GB grammar and adapt it using Miguel's
C# compiler code. I say this because there are many complications which
one runs into when writing a grammar for VB and having tracked down and
eliminated loads of s/r conflicts, IMHO this would be the better way to go
about it.

	But let's see anyway.


&gt;<i> think the trees and even the grammar files will be very similar. Not
</I>
	Possibly. But I really need Beta2 !! I can't work blindly like
this ! And I can't possibly download it over my Modem connection !


&gt;<i> that VB.NET is just a diferent 'wording' of C#: there are support for
</I>&gt;<i> some constructs that are specific, but the number is small.
</I>
	I have the DotNet docs and yes, it seems like a lot of cruft has
been done away with.


&gt;<i> Kunde, is interested in supporting VB6 syntax on Mono, I think that he
</I>&gt;<i> can start directly from what GB has achieved...
</I>
	Yes.


&gt;<i> I´ve gained a second workstation at work, for .NET research and
</I>&gt;<i> development and so I´m planning to effectively contribute some code to
</I>&gt;<i> Mono soon.
</I>
	Excellent :-)

	I am all set for this too so let's begin ! But somebody get me
Beta2 !!

	Regards,

		Ravi
