<PRE>&gt;<i> If someone were to put together a different execution engine under a non-GPL
</I>&gt;<i> license (such as the modified BSD license or even closed source...), would
</I>&gt;<i> they be able to use the Mono class library the way it is currently licensed?
</I>&gt;<i> I cross-posted this to the Portable.NET list as I'm interested in the same
</I>&gt;<i> question as applied to pnetlib, seeing that the recent &quot;let's try to get
</I>&gt;<i> together talks&quot; seemed to get the standard Miguel smack-down in the recent
</I>&gt;<i> thread.
</I>
Yes, our intention is that the Mono class library can be used with any
other runtime engines (proprietary, free, partially free, somewhat
free, pink, red or yellow)

&gt;<i> Part of the conflict behind this question has to do with the native code
</I>&gt;<i> library and such that is planning on being used by at least Mono (if not
</I>&gt;<i> pnetlib, not sure what happened with this) for dealing with P/Invoke from
</I>&gt;<i> the libraries out into the world, which I'm assuming will also end up under
</I>&gt;<i> some variant of GPL, and might even end up linking against full GPL code as
</I>&gt;<i> some point (making it fully GPL...).
</I>
That bit of the library is under the LGPL so it allows for any use as
well.

We are considering using even a laxer license in the future, something
like the X11 license.  But we have not decided yet.

Miguel.
