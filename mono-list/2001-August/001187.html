well, after much messing around and hand-hacking makefiles, i've been able to
get right up to compiling mono-int on FreeBSD, and it fails to link.  it's not
finding isordered() isless() isgreater() and islessequal().  what library are
these supposed to be in?  something in glibc that isn't in the BSD libc?

anyway, that seems to be the last problem.  everything else can be worked
around by adding the appropriate uses of glib-config and gtk-config. (also, i
had to hand hack a -I../../libffi/include to get it to pick up ffi.h)  i still
don't know what the correct way to deal with these things is, but at least it
compiles.  no promisses on wether it runs or not though...
