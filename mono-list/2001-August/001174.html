 &gt; That said, I have the following feelings about the project. I am for the
 &gt; most part unafraid of any patents in Microsoft's portfolio. Sure they
 &gt; could try to put the screws to us but those screws will generate ALOT of
 &gt; press for us. 
 &gt; 
 &gt; By attacking open source this year, Micro$oft gave us the opportunity to
 &gt; educate the world on open source. If they attack us with patents, I
 &gt; think we will receive another opportunity to speak out against software
 &gt; patents.

I don't think MicroSoft is scared of press.  Part of being a monopoly
is that you don't need to care what people think -- they still only
have one choice as to from whom they can buy Windows and Office.
Sure, all things being equal, they don't want bad press, but if they
percieve Mono as a threat to their dot-Net monopoly, I'm sure they'd
prefer a monopoly with bad press over good press with competition.

On the other hand, crushing Mono might be percieved as
anti-competative by some otherwise-neutral politicians, which would
threaten their other monopolies.  That's the basis on which I'm not
too worried about MS patents.  If they *do* get broken up, though,
we're in for it.
