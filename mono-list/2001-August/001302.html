<PRE>Thank you Garrett. 
In my city I just found anyone and I was in doubt about which to order.
Thanks so much. I think it could be interesting to include in the Mono
site a list with descriptions about the documentation that newbies
should read, a link to the books, pdfs... would be nice. I offer myself
to write and mantein that page if you (whoever is responsible of the
page) agree. Or I can open a SF.net project to have all this information
together so we newbie people don't need to &quot;summon&quot; the masters for such
little thing.

Jaime.
