<PRE>&gt;<i> The second bottom line is: you can use the Mono C# library, I would be
</I>&gt;<i> glad if you and many other runtimes use it.  
</I>
Sure, you said that before.  But may I remind you of these
questions that have so far remained unanswered?

a) Are you willing to work together more closely with a Free
   Software initiave like DotGNU than you would for example work
   together with &quot;EvilCompany&quot;?

b) In particular, would it work for you to make the C# class
   library a GNU project and to work together with the DotGNU
   Steering Committee to make sure that this class library meets
   the needs of the DotGNU project as well as the needs of the
   Mono project?

c) How is the Mono class library licensed? (GPL plus linking
   exception?  LGPL?) 


I include my previous message below, in order to clarify the
context of these questions.

Greetings, Norbert.

I had written:

&gt;<i> &gt; Miguel, would it work for you to make the C# class library a GNU

Miguel de Icaza &lt;<A HREF="mailto:miguel@ximian.com">miguel@ximian.com</A>&gt; replied:

&gt;<i> As I have said in the past, the class library for Mono can be used by
</I>&gt;<i> anyone who feels like using it.  If changes and improvements need to
</I>&gt;<i> happen to it to allow other runtimes to use it that is fine with us.
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone could use this as their class library, DotGNU, Kaffe, IBM, ORP,
</I>&gt;<i> EvilCompany, they can all use the class libraries for their JIT
</I>&gt;<i> engine.  You can even use it for embedded work.  
</I>
The question is whether you are willing to work together more
closely with a Free Software initiave like DotGNU than you would
for example work together with &quot;EvilCompany&quot;...

It may work for most kinds of projects to simply take a class
library that is available somewhere as Free Software, but
because of Microsoft's current high level of enmity against
GPL'd Free Software, we must be much more careful in DotGNU.

The C# class library is a key component for DotGNU and we cannot
afford to take the risk of relying on Mono's class library
unless we have very good reasons to believe that there are no
risks of the kind that some court might decide that we have to
stop using it.  We really need to have evidence that this
library has been properly cleanroomed, otherwise we cannot rely
on it.

By the way, how is the Mono class library licensed?
(GPL plus linking exception?  LGPL?)

Greetings, Norbert.
