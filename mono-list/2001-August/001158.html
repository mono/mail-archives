<PRE>I have a question. Is it safe to look at the API documentation on
Microsofts website? For example, if you wanted to work on the System.Data
classes.

</I>&gt;<i> look at any shared source implementations or disassemblies on the Mono
</I>&gt;<i> website.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (I tried to explain the dangers of this to the ReactOS project w.r.t. the
</I>&gt;<i> shared source release of WinCE 3.0, but it fell on deaf ears. I
</I>&gt;<i> think reactos.com even links to the shared source download page somewhere
</I>&gt;<i> now. For those who don't know, ReactOS is aimed at producing a GPL'd

</I>&gt;<i> seems to be coming along very well.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -
</I>&gt;<i> On a completely different note... Miguel, does the runtime currently
</I>&gt;<i> include metadata validation? I couldn't find anything in libmetadata
</I>&gt;<i> or any other part of the runtime that looked like it could be it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Similarly, does the runtime include in the metadata table info information
</I>&gt;<i> about what the column's values are (i.e., 1,2,4 byte constants or indexes
</I>&gt;<i> in heaps?). It's the kind of thing that would make testing for row
</I>&gt;<i> uniqueness not quite the PITA it could be, but again, I couldn't find it
</I>&gt;<i> anywhere if it's there.
