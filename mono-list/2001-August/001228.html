<PRE>So I got the Beta 2 stuff from Microsoft the other week in the mail and 
figured I'd see what there was and also see if I couldn't give mono a hand or 
two while I'm at it.  Maybe with some unit tests or such till I get up to 
speed.  What I was wondering was how much disk space will I need to get enough 
of .NET installed to get a good grasp of everything?  I can't install anything 
(or even look at the disk) untill I get back to school since it's a DVD.  Once 
I get back to school I can swipe a DVD drive for a day or two and give this a 
whirl.

Thanks,
Tony
