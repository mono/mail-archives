lets try and keep in mind that writing a virtual machine, even a crappy one
with low performance that would only be suitable for development while a
better one is in the works, is a big job, and it isn't going to happen
overnight.  so is writing a compiler.  so is writing the class library to
support them.

work on all three of these things is happening.  if you want confirmation of
that just subscribe to the mono-cvs mailing list.  until it progresses far
enough to support development on unix, you'll just have to wait or develop on
windows.  i don't particularly like it, but that's the way it is.

remember, the project has a public life span that so far can be measured in
weeks.  asking for a fully working development environment on unix (hell,
asking for a barely working development environment on unix) at this point is
expecting a bit much.
