<PRE>Miguel de Icaza &lt;<A HREF="mailto:miguel@ximian.com">miguel@ximian.com</A>&gt; wrote (in reply to me):

&gt;<i> &gt; Sure, you said that before.  But may I remind you of these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; questions that have so far remained unanswered?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can answer those questions, but they seem mostly of religious
</I>&gt;<i> nature.  And I honestly find them offensive.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a) Are you willing to work together more closely with a Free
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    Software initiave like DotGNU than you would for example work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    together with &quot;EvilCompany&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I find you making this question offensive.  I have worked for six
</I>&gt;<i> years straight writing free software.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am also not interested in demonizing anyone.  Including Microsoft.
</I>
I certainly did not intend to offend you... I have been
surprised though that your offer to DotGNU was nothing more than
the exact same level of cooperation that you also offer to
&quot;Kaffe, IBM, ORP, EvilCompany&quot; (your words).  I am referring to
this passage from one of your earlier emails:

:<i> As I have said in the past, the class library for Mono can be used by
</I>:<i> anyone who feels like using it.  If changes and improvements need to
</I>:<i> happen to it to allow other runtimes to use it that is fine with us.
</I>:<i> Anyone could use this as their class library, DotGNU, Kaffe, IBM, ORP,
</I>:<i> EvilCompany, they can all use the class libraries for their JIT
</I>:<i> engine.  You can even use it for embedded work.  
</I>
Suppose Mono says &quot;everyone should use our lib and contribute to
it&quot;, and DotGNU also says &quot;everyone should use our lib and
contribute to it&quot; -- would you consider that a desirable
situation?  Or would it be better to meet somewhere in the middle?

Greetings, Norbert.
