please send the patches, so that we can include them.

Great :-) I think you have to use the monolib2 target to make the corlib:

&gt;<i>make CSC=csc monolib2
</I>
This include some classes needed by the runtime. There are also some regression
tests in mono/mono/tests. Everything beside exception.exe and struct.exe should
work.
