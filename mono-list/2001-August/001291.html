<PRE>&gt;<i> Sure, you said that before.  But may I remind you of these
</I>&gt;<i> questions that have so far remained unanswered?
</I>
I can answer those questions, but they seem mostly of religious
nature.  And I honestly find them offensive.


&gt;<i> a) Are you willing to work together more closely with a Free
</I>&gt;<i>    Software initiave like DotGNU than you would for example work
</I>&gt;<i>    together with &quot;EvilCompany&quot;?
</I>
I find you making this question offensive.  I have worked for six
years straight writing free software.  

I am also not interested in demonizing anyone.  Including Microsoft.

&gt;<i> b) In particular, would it work for you to make the C# class
</I>&gt;<i>    library a GNU project and to work together with the DotGNU
</I>&gt;<i>    Steering Committee to make sure that this class library meets
</I>&gt;<i>    the needs of the DotGNU project as well as the needs of the
</I>&gt;<i>    Mono project?
</I>
I have offered before people to get CVS access to the Mono repository
so they can commit changes to allow the class libraries to work with
their runtimes. 

Mono is not a GNU project because being part of GNU means that I have
to use the expression `GNU/Linux'.   If you want to know why I wont do
this, read (the bottom of):

And that just tells a small part of the story.  But it is not worth
getting into details.

&gt;<i> c) How is the Mono class library licensed? (GPL plus linking
</I>&gt;<i>    exception?  LGPL?) 
</I>
You can read the license on the Mono web site:
