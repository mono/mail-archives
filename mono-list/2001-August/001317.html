[Resending due to bounces caused by faulty MX records - please forgive
 any duplicates that you receive.]

We indeed need to pay close attention to legal issues.  In the DotGNU
project, we always have.  Eben Moglen is working closely with us on the
details of all these legal matters, and he is looking closely to see if
there are any possible problems with Portable.NET.

(For those of you who don't know, Eben Moglen is a law professor at
 Columbia University, general legal counsel to the FSF, board member of
 the FSF and is often referred to as the &quot;Attorney General of the Free
 Software Movement&quot;.  He is the most prominent legal expert on the GPL,
 and very well versed in copyright law as it applies to software.)


I encourage you, Miguel, and the rest of the Mono team to discuss your
legal situation with Moglen, just as the DotGNU team has.  He's a very
smart fellow, and can surely provide useful insight.  And, a stamp of
approval from him carries the great weight.

I realize that some DotGNU developers are expressing concern about the
legal status of Mono.  Regardless of whether or not that concern is
warranted, I am sure that if Moglen takes a look at your procedure, and
rules that there is no problem, that'll be all the assurances the DotGNU
team needs.

I hope the Mono team will start an ongoing dialogue with Moglen, just as
the DotGNU team has.
