<PRE>&gt;<i> it looks like monodis is working fine (at least its output for a test program
</I>&gt;<i> i wrote seems reasonable).  pedump seems to work, except it complains about
</I>&gt;<i> fields in the CLI header that should be 0 but aren't.  
</I>
The latest spec I have claims `These fields must be zero'.  I guess
they changed their mind.  That warning is there just as a reminder
that we should look at that once the new spec drafts come out.

&gt;<i> i haven't looked into this closer, as i wanted to verify that i'm actually
</I>&gt;<i> following the right procedure to run this thing.  i built the class libraries
</I>&gt;<i> on windows, and copied corlibx.dll to /usr/local/lib/corlib.dll, since
</I>&gt;<i> mono-int seems to want corlib.dll to be there.  then i just ran mono-int
</I>&gt;<i> test.exe where test.exe is a simple c# program i wrote and compiled on
</I>&gt;<i> windows.  how's this so far?
</I>
That is excellent!

Maybe we should start compiling the class libraries and some sample
programs and have them available on the web site for people to test.

Miguel.
