and to continue my long tradition of replying to myself...

i've now tried actually running stuff with the interpreter on FreeBSD.

it passes the smoke test.  a do-nothing program (literally the only
thing in the Main() is return) runs fine.  granted, it doesn't do
much, but it doesn't crash either.

unfortunately, it isn't all good news.  hello world crashes.  it spits
out 3 lines of this:

** WARNING **: fixme: wrong size for value type

(which appears to come from line 1664 of metadata.c, right next to a
big fixme comment...  then this

** ERROR **: file class.c: line 464 (mono_class_get): should not be reached

then aborts, dumping core.

line 464 is in mono_class_get, and is the bottom of the switch, so
something is definately wrong here.

another small program i tried (a simple fibinacci sequence) dies in
mono_get_method, at line 363 of loader.c, trying to look something up
in the method_cache hash table.

i'm anxious to help debug these problems, but i don't really know
where to start, so if someone can point me towards a place to look, or
info that would help, i'd appreciate it.
