And there was me thinking I was a mono hacker.

I thought the idea was to come up with an open source C# library.

See, you're assuming the duplicated effort is by definition Bad, and
therefore we shouldn't do it. This is, unfortunately, a flawed argument,
because the assumption isn't provable; it's especially flawed given that
we have two open source projects that can freely borrow from each other,
assuming pride doesn't get in the way. What you call duplication of
effort, I call diversity: it's why we've got more than one editor, more
than one Unix kernel, more than one mail user agent, more than one mail
transfer agent. Diversity is our strength. Think about it.

Competition is *useful*. A lack of competition in the software world
leads to... well, you know full well what it leads to.
