<PRE>Just out of curiosity, what does the completion column in the class status
page indicate?  There are several classes that i've noticed which are listed
as 100 percent complete which have a large number of methods which are not
implemented (System.Collections.ArrayList is an example, chosen only because
it happens to be at the top of its page).  If this number means something
other than 'amount complete', what is it, and if it does mean that, we should
really look at the classes and make the numbers match reality.
