</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; so i had some free time and decided to take another crack at mono on freebsd.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; note, this is with code a few days old, so if anything has changed lately,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; this isn't taking that into account.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; i wrote implementations of the is(whatever) math functions for freebsd
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (basically just took the linux versions and used isnan() instead of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; fpclassify().  that got everything compiling fine.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; please send the patches, so that we can include them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> oh, absolutely.  right now i've just got them stuck in interp.c, which is of
</I>&gt;<i> course wrong.  i imagine someone will want to stick them into some other file
</I>&gt;<i> in case they need to be used in other places.
</I>
I will put that into hacks.h

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; it looks like monodis is working fine (at least its output for a test program
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; i wrote seems reasonable).  pedump seems to work, except it complains about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; fields in the CLI header that should be 0 but aren't.  the interpreter itself
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; is dying in ves_exec_method() at the CEE_CALL case, right as it calls
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; mono_get_method().
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; i haven't looked into this closer, as i wanted to verify that i'm actually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; following the right procedure to run this thing.  i built the class libraries
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; on windows, and copied corlibx.dll to /usr/local/lib/corlib.dll, since
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; mono-int seems to want corlib.dll to be there.  then i just ran mono-int
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; test.exe where test.exe is a simple c# program i wrote and compiled on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; windows.  how's this so far?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Great :-) I think you have to use the monolib2 target to make the corlib:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;make CSC=csc monolib2
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This include some classes needed by the runtime. There are also some regression
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tests in mono/mono/tests. Everything beside exception.exe and struct.exe should
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i'll try that next time i get some time.  thanks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (the math stuff is attached.  enjoy.)

thanks :-)
