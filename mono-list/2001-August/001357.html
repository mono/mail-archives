<PRE>If someone were to put together a different execution engine under a non-GPL
license (such as the modified BSD license or even closed source...), would
they be able to use the Mono class library the way it is currently licensed?
I cross-posted this to the Portable.NET list as I'm interested in the same
question as applied to pnetlib, seeing that the recent &quot;let's try to get
together talks&quot; seemed to get the standard Miguel smack-down in the recent
thread.

Part of the conflict behind this question has to do with the native code
library and such that is planning on being used by at least Mono (if not
pnetlib, not sure what happened with this) for dealing with P/Invoke from
the libraries out into the world, which I'm assuming will also end up under
some variant of GPL, and might even end up linking against full GPL code as
some point (making it fully GPL...).

Sincerely,
Jay Freeman (saurik)

&quot;The short story:  You should use the Mono C# library, and contribute to it.
