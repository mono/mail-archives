<PRE>Thanks, Miguel

  I've read the article you pointed. But the problem I'm still worried is 
about NOT KNOWING which patents we have to avoid.

  For example, suppose the Reflection.Emit mechanism is patented, and in 
very general terms. We are using it in our compilers. We work hard, produce 
usable compilers, publish it under GPL, and then get notified that we have 
to settle with MS. We can go back to code and implement a traditional 
back-end to generate IL. But MS can still reach to us, seeking financial 
remedies, because &quot;potentially&quot; some people is using our first version, 
because it's published in the Internet.

ENDNOTE 1: I agree with you, software patents MUST be abolished, or the 
darkest sci-fi scenarios of corporate dictatorship can become a reality 
sooner than expected, because software is embedded in nearly everything.

ENDNOTE 2: DMCA is a sour reminder of how misguided the US politicians are 
about what is best for society. Corporations are important, but their rights 
MUST be submitted to the needs of society and individuals.
