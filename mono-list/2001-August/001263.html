I'm inclined to agree about competition, however, you have to understand 
that there are side-effects to everything.  Having two libraries that are 
meant to achieve the same exact goal (compliance with the ECMA C# standard) 
could do some very bad things for development on our mutual C# 
platforms.  Granted, most of this work could be managed and solutions can 
come to be, but having two projects which do the exact same thing when one 
with a larger developer count is possible - having one would  simply be better.

Do what you want with the rest of mono, but I think that sharing the burden 
of the library may have some serious advantages.
