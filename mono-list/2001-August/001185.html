<PRE>so in a fit of insanity, i decided to try compiling mono on my FreeBSD box at
home.  it actually doesn't look that bad.  i haven't gotten anything to
actually run, but almost everything seems to compile just fine.  (something
isn't right in interp.c, but that may just be the snapshot i downloaded, as i
haven't tried checking the current code out of cvs yet)

here's what i had to do to make it compile...

0) setenv GLIB_CONFIG /usr/local/bin/glib12-config since that's where the
freebsd ports system puts it. 

1) add GLIB_CFLAGS = `$(GLIB_CONFIG) --cflags` and GLIB_LIBS=`$(GLIB_CONFIG)
--libs` in the Makefiles.  i imagine we should be making our automake setup do
this anyway, since that's what glib_config exists for, but my automake foo is
basically nonexistent.  if someone could point me in the proper direction, i'd
be happy to make this change, i just don't know where to start.

2) install p5-XML-Parser from ports, since one of our perl scripts uses it.

3) for some reason, it wasn't picking up the in tree version of ffi.  i
avoided dealing with this problem by instaling libffi from ports and manually
pointing gcc at it's headers.  while that seemed to work, i'm skeptical, so
i'll probably go back and try to figure out what was going on with this later.

at this point, i got up to compiling interp.c, and it died.  i'm going to go
check out the current cvs and see what kind of luck i have there.  anyway, it
looks pretty good for at least getting it all built on FreeBSD...  now to see
if any of this actually works...
