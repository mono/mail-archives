<PRE>[snip]
&gt;<i> I believe that you and Ravi are talking about different kind of register
</I>&gt;<i> allocation.  The compiler tries to do some reuse of local variables, but
</I>&gt;<i> I do have to revisit this, as we are doing it in less places than we
</I>&gt;<i> could and in some cases, we need a way of flagging entries as
</I>&gt;<i> use-only-once (because they have special semantics, like `pinned')
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>No I think we had the same thing in mind, what I forgot to say at the bottom of that last post was, if the mcs compiler does squeeze the locals into as few as possible, then a compiler that takes the IL produced as input then has the knowledge that all the locals must interfere with each other, ie it doesn't have to do liveness analysis on the locals since it's already been done. Of course this is a bit naughty anyway since such a compiler should really accept IL produced from any source_language-&gt;IL compiler so it should do it's own liveness analysis anyway.
