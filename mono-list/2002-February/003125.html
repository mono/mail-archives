I've not yet released it and am still generating the documentation for
the APIs. I've developed 3 system email architectures over the past 5
years and I intend for this to be the culminanation of that work.  More
importantly, I intend for it to be the basis for a wider communication
system for .NET.   .NETMail supports the APIs and classes for:

*  Internet addresses (per RFC822) and address lists.
*  Plain text, HTML, MIME Multipart and Related Content messages
(RFC2045)
*  Attachments and complete access to all message parts, attachements,
headers, etc.
*  Base64 and quoted printable transfer encoding (other encoders plug
in).
*  Embedded media types (RFC 2046)
*  User-defined headers.
*  Construction, receipt, send, reply, and forward of messages.
*  Abstract message stores supporting nested folders.
*  Concrete file-system message store.
*  Some work done on a SQL Server-based message store.
*  SMTP client classes
*  SMTP server classes w/SMTP server(not yet complete, basic SMTP is
currently supported)
*  POP client classes
*  POP server classes w/POP server(not yet complete)
*  Beginning of message search engine.

I've recently undertaken rewriting a lot of the messaging classes,
particularly the message parsers that construct the messages from
incoming data streams.  I'm still testing a lot of that and fixing code
in places.  As soon as I get that stuff done, I'm going to release the
.NETMail core libraries, followed by the SMTP and POP service libraries.

In the meantime, if it's still desirable to have the basic
System.Web.Mail classes let me know and I'll finish up the
self-contained libs.
