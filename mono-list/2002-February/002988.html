<PRE>Just a short recap of the reactions I got on my message on the
generation of Guids.

Piers and Dan, thanks for the references to the information on Guid's
and their generation. I wasn't aware of this info and I will use it to
refine my original strategy. I thought I had at least some understanding
of how Guid's are generated, but I wasn't aware of the fact that some
bits actually have semantics.

On the e2fs implementation of the generation algorithm: I was aware of
its existence. I actually did have a (quick) look at the code earlier.
In fact, one of the first strategies I thought of was calling the e2fs
implementation for the Linux implementation and the Win32 implemtation
in the COM subsystem on Windows. But then I read an earlier message of
Miquel on the reduction of dependencies and realized that an
re-implementation in the Mono class library was necessary.

As said above, I will refine my strategy and reopen the discussion once
I have a more detailed overview of the InternalCall's (or additions to
the class library) actually needed.

Duco
