<PRE>&gt;<i> Oh, then there is a lot of interesting stuff that you can do:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	* Work on tests for the class library.
</I>
Well, basically the only problem here is to find a way to run a test using
our class libraries and not mscorlib.dll. The tests themselves aren't really
specific to Linux or Windows (except, of course, if you're testing an
OS-specific class), so we only need one set of tests for both platforms.

Unfortunately I have no idea how to tell an application to pick our corlib.dll
instead of mscorlib.dll on Windows.

&gt;<i> I suggest you write the tests first, because writing tests gets you up
</I>&gt;<i> to speed with .NET idioms and C# and it makes you understand the various
</I>&gt;<i> interlocking piece of the class library.  Armed with this knowledge
</I>&gt;<i> implementing the classes is even more fun!
</I>
If you just want to write tests, you don't even need to worry about the
runtime at all - just write your tests using mscorlib.dll and make sure they
pass. This way we make sure we have working test cases (ie. if a test passes
using mscorlib.dll it must also pass with our corlib).

Other people can then run your tests on Windows to test our class libraries.
