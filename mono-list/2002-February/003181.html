Yes, teach people to not unnecessarily CC all the names they can think
of and that are obviously subscribed to the list and to post with the
address they are subscribed.
What usually happens is that someone sends a mail to mono-list from the
wrong address (or he is not subscribed) and CCs miguel. The message is
kept in the moderation queue, miguel will reply and the reply will make
to the list before the first post does.
