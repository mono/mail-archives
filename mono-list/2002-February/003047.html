<PRE>As I see things the XSP is just another page handler and not a webserver. IIS is a webserver, Apache is but XSP is more like ASP or ASP.Net. Our webserver should support both because the callbacks are simple to implement, I will implement a callback that can handle ASP.Net IHttpModule's and IHttpHandler's but to make it support XSP or other page types would not be that hard.
 
My efforts is to make the System.Web classes ready and all of the subnamespaces (except the Hosting) to support ASP.Net apps on different platforms and to support this we need a simple webserver. 
 
My company today have several apps today that uses SOAP and HTTP/XML protocols and they main req on a webserver is lightwight and that is easy to use not performance. The question is if we should implement a powerful server in C# or just a mini web server that also could help us to support the remoting namespaces.

	Please try to keep the interfaces compatible with XSP, which is going to be
	in Apache 2. XSP is becoming a W3 standard, and it seems to have every
	capability that ASP.NET does, including multilingual support.
	
	ASP.NET looks simple on the surface. It doesn't look like you need to do
	much more than GSP did (<A HREF="http://gsp.sourceforge.net">http://gsp.sourceforge.net</A>) to support multiple
	languages. However, when you start looking at all the caching and other
	options on the many of the directives (e.g. page), things look more
	complicated. Basing Mono's ASP.NET support on Microsoft's ASP.NET libraries
	for IIS compatibility, and Mono's ASP.NET support on XSP for Apache
	compatibility really simplifies things.
	
	The catch, right now, is that the reference implementation is in Java and
	multilingual support is done through IBM's Bean Scripting Framework
	(<A HREF="http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/projects/bsf">http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/projects/bsf</A>). I can't find anything
	in the XSP spec that says it has to be based on Java.
	
	That's not really a big issue since any one of the following approaches
	should work:
	
	(1) XSP can be rewritten for Mono using the Java implement as a guide.
	Translating Java to C# doesn't seem like an overwhelmingly complicated job
	since both languages are so similar. The tough part is coming up with the
	initial architecture. Microsoft and Apache have already done this for their
	web servers through ASP.NET and Cocoon (for XSP).
	
	(2) There seems to be some interest in getting Java to compile to .NET, so
	if this open source effort succeeds (or even takes off the ground), Cocoon
	could be compiled for Mono and we'd get XSP for free.
	
	(3) It really isn't necessary to completely integrate with XSP, all that's
	needed to be done is to generate XSP pages. This article gives a brief
	account of what needs to be done.
	    <A HREF="http://www.phpbuilder.com/columns/bealers20000616.php3?page=1">http://www.phpbuilder.com/columns/bealers20000616.php3?page=1</A>
	Now I don't like the implementation very much. XML doesn't have to be
	generated manually, there are classes to do it. Instead of writing to a file
	xinclude should be able to read the stream directly. However, the gist of
	the idea should be applicable to Mono too.
