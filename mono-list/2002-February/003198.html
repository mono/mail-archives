 &gt; &gt;  &gt; In any case the CLR is designed to avoid that by making its requirement of
 &gt; &gt;  &gt; multiply inherited classes be abstract, so if you want broken OO via impure
 &gt; &gt;  &gt; Mixins, I wouldn't expect the CLR to ever support that. ILX would still
 &gt; &gt;  &gt; support the CLR notion of single inheritance, multiple interfaces.
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; You're talking about interfaces, not mixins.  The term came from the
 &gt; &gt; Flavors object system for Lisp, and mixins *do* come with
 &gt; &gt; implementations.  They're little classes that aretn't terribly useful
 &gt; &gt; by themselves, but when mixed in with a substantial class, add
 &gt; &gt; functionality.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Which from a modern OO perspective is a Very Bad Thing. Which is why
 &gt; neither Java nor C# support them.

Bah.  You seem to have missed the point that the OP was asking about:
whether the .NET CLR can support more than just languages that look
like C#.  I would agree that mixin classes would be a bad idea in Java
or C#.  But not all languages are like C#.  For dynamically-typed
languages, mixins do *not* break encapsulation.

 &gt; To achieve what you want without breaking encapsulation, use the
 &gt; decorator pattern. Again if refer to Gang of Four.

Such patterns are specific to languages like C++.  They apply somewhat
to Smalltalk, but really little at all to Lisp.
