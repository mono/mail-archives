<PRE>|<i> Thinking about the todo generator - it must be possible to organise the
</I>|<i> directory structure and naming conventions of the tests so that we can
</I>|<i> automagically determine whether or not there are at least _some_
</I>|<i> tests for a
</I>|<i> given class. Could we go (or have we already gone) further and
</I>|<i> arrange that
</I>|<i> the tests deposit some kind of standardised pass/fail mark file so that we
</I>|<i> can figure out whether the implementation has passed the tests? Is this
</I>|<i> similar to what Duncan's up to?
</I>
I'm not really sure what Duncan is up to, but I know he was building
something using CorCompare as a starting point, and was looking into getting
at the [MonoTODO] attributes.

The convention for the tests is that each class's test is in a namespace
which is the same as the namespace for the class plus &quot;MonoTests.&quot; tacked on
the front.  So for instance, the test class for Hashtable is &quot;HashtableTest&quot;
and it is in &quot;MonoTests.System.Collections&quot; namespace.

It should be pretty straight forward to look in the assembly that houses the
NUnit tests, e.g. corlib_test.dll and see what classes have tests.
Something that would be cool is to automagically figure out which
methods/properties have tests too.  Again, a naming convention would
probably be enough, but I'm not sure if we want to go that far.

|<i> Also, who or what is the definitive source of module maintainer
</I>|<i> information?
</I>
The current source for maintainer info is the mono/status/class.xml.  We had
a discussion a month or two ago about putting attributes in the sources to
mark the maintainer and/or author(s).  It was decided that extra attributes
are a &quot;bad thing&quot; and we'll just use [MonoTODO].  The MonoTODO's are removed
as a piece is completed, so in the shipping assembly, there won't be any
&quot;extra&quot; attributes to slow things down, cause problems, etc.

In any case, putting the maintainer on the status page for a class is
probably not necessary right now, IMHO.

Let's both have a look at what JBarn has done in doctools and see where we
go from there.

In the meantime, do you have any comments about the XML structure I sent
before?
