<PRE>okay,

it seems that a few hours ago the cvs was broken, which made me go back
to the 0.8 release ... problem seems solved now. So with a newly
from-cvs compiled mint I'm on th road again.

.. but I think I found an other problem ...


using System;

class crash {
        public static void Main() {
                string name = &quot;Christophe&quot;;
                Console.WriteLine( name );
                Console.WriteLine( &quot;{0}&quot;, name );

                int number = 1;
                Console.WriteLine( number );
                Console.WriteLine( &quot;{0}&quot;, number );
        }
}

segfaults on execution of the last (4th) WriteLine ... (my guess is it
will be fixed in the CVS version of mcs :) but ... see PPS)

C

PS I'm just going through some examples from a C# tutorial 

PPS I don't have a windows-based compiling system, so I can't recompile
the mcs itself from CVS. Maybe it would be a good idea to have mcs.exe
snapshots for us windows-impaired ;-)


&gt;<i> It works fine here. Since 0.8 there's been a lot of bugfixing, but
</I>&gt;<i> if you can use the latests mcs/corlib/runtime combo from cvs and
</I>&gt;<i> confirm it works for you, too, that would be nice.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!

It is ridiculous to claim that video games
influence children.  Nonsense!

For instance, if PacMan affected kids born in the
eighties, we should by now have a bunch of teenagers
who run around in darkened rooms and eat pills while
listening to monotonous electronic music.
