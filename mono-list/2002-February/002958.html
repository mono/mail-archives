<PRE>Hi All,

I have been trying for a few days to get mono set up in linux / windows
so that I can contribute to the development....

I have MS visual studio 98... and for the past few days I thought that
would have been good enough... but now I think it won't work... am I
correct???

If this is the case I can not compile libiconv my self... I see there is
a pre built one on the web site... I didn't see where I need to put what
files and where on my windows machine... is there a DOC for this????

Do I need MS c for anything else to be fully productive?

Thanks in Advance!

- Bob
