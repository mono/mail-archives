<PRE>Hi Serge,

&gt;<i> &gt; Exactly. But if mcs supports many languages, someone is more likely to
</I>&gt;<i> want
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to work on developing a gcc backend than if it supports just one....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, but I honestly don't understand what do you mean by &quot;backend&quot; here?
</I>&gt;<i> In traditional sense it would be a GCC backend emitting IL for any source
</I>&gt;<i> language.
</I>
Sorry about the unintended confusion Serge. I meant &quot;use GCC as a backend&quot;.
By which I mean building an IL-frontend to GCC. Of course from the
perspective of mcc/MonoBASIC, it would be a &quot;GCC backend&quot;. A backend - to
mcs - that uses GCC.

&gt;<i> But it seems that neither MCS nor MonoBASIC not designed to act as a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;frontend&quot; for GCC. They are Reflection based compilers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or do you mean GCC frontend to accept IL (and translate it to native code
</I>&gt;<i> with existing backends), in this case it doesn't matter how that IL was
</I>&gt;<i> emmited - by standalone compiler or compiler suite, and there are already
</I>&gt;<i> many compilers emmiting IL.
</I>&gt;<i> Also if I understand correctly, it is not possible to use GCC's own IR
</I>&gt;<i> _outside_ of GCC, so MCS emmiting RTL is not an option either.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, from a end-user point of view I'd prefer more lightweight standalone
</I>&gt;<i> compilers, more than compiler suites.
</I>
Why exactly?. What would be the difference?.

&gt;<i> Also, isn't it very easy to share code between .NET programs? I mean if
</I>&gt;<i> there is some common functionality between compilers (of course, there is)
</I>&gt;<i> why not share it in &quot;component&quot; way, instead of integrating?
</I>
I see you're already thinking up creative ways to re-architect and package
the compilers - given their substantial shared functionality - rather than
than simply forking them as Miguel proposed  ;-)

We might end up with mcs.exe and mbas.exe and jcs.exe and mvb.exe etc. that
are just drivers for an hypothetical monoparser.dll component....
