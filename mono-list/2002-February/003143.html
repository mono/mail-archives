Yes, it is sadly true.  Participating in the Mono project can indeed result
in massive and expensive flooding.

Perhaps you doubt this.  You say to yourself, how can something as innocuous
as reading a mailing list and looking at C# code cause such disaster?  Allow
me to detail my experience, which proves beyond a shadow of a doubt the
incredible risk that readers of this newsgroup face daily.

Today, I decided not to go out for lunch to any of the nearby eateries, and
instead I would munch on snacks at work and spend my time catching up on
mono-list traffic.  That fatal decision made, I walked to the company
kitchen to wash out a bowl I use for tasty delicacies such as Ramen noodles.
There I discovered that the kitchen sink wasn't getting any hot water.  All
of this is obviously Mono's fault for keeping my at work on my lunch break,
but it gets even worse.

As the responsible corporate employee that I am, I dutifully sent off a
quick email to our facilities manager to look into the hot water, and
settled in to read mono-list.  Suddenly, in the middle of the &quot;Setting mono
in LinuxPPC&quot; thread, we hear a splash in the kitchen.  Moments later a
broadcast email goes out to all company employees to avoid the kitchen due
to a water problem.

Yes, sadly, in attempting to fix the hot water, building maintenance
mistakenly caused a water leak that resulted in turning our kitchen area
into a  small (25-foot) pond, and trapping our poor CEO in his office,
hemmed in by water on all sides.  I just hope it didn't get the floor
beneath us too wet, since we're on the 9th floor.

Clearly, _ALL_ Mono participants are at risk for similar disasters.  I for
one would push for a Mono fire and water-hazard awareness FAQ, to increase
list awareness of the dangers, and to offer a support-group for the
unfortunate injured and maimed.
