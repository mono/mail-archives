 &gt; (c) ObjC and IL are both Turing-complete

I've been trying to avoid this thread, but you keep mentioning this
almost every post, and it's driving me up the wall: bringing up
Turing-machine equivalence is a troll.  If that mattered one whit,
there would be no reason to care about interoperability between any
two languages.  Only someone who just passed his sophomore year CS
class, or one who doesn't want to think about things that are easier
to not think about, could be so foolish as to consider
Turing-equivalence something worth mentioning.
