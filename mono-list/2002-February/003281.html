<PRE>&gt;<i> And I will NOT go along with your assumption that multiple inheritence is a bad thing, to assert such out of hand borders on the childish.
</I>
Well, state your assumptions. I have given my reasons for why I dislike
Multiple Inheritance. You haven't given any concrete response other than
a silly &quot;my language is better than your language&quot;-type defence.

In any case, and once again, this is a decision that has been made for
you. The CLR doesn't support multiple inheritance. It's out of your
hands, live with it. Most OO purists dislike multiple inheritance. The
design of the CLR reflects this.
