<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Whether you like it or not, ther is a &quot;One True Way&quot; here- the CLR way.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;It's not religion, it's the runtime you're working with. It has already
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;been established that Multiple Inheritance was not allowed in the CLR
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;because of the problems of diamond inheritance and over-complex
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;instantiation rules, and also that mixin functionality can be achieved
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;using the decorator pattern.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the last time... mix-ins do not have a constructor and therefore do not impact instantiation.
</I>
Makes no differency. Any mixin classes would still subclass
System.Object or one of its subclasses at the top of a diamond
inheritance pattern, meaning that the instantiation of any class that
uses mixins has multiple routes back up the tree to the &quot;root&quot;
constructor.

Inheritance hierarchies should be strictly directed and acyclical. This
is why multiple inheritance is disallowed.
