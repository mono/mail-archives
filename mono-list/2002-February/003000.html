<PRE>Just joined the list hours ago to see where I could contribute and this
caught my eye. If you would like I would be happy to write a simple web
server for the project. I would imagine that a web server interface would be
ideal, so that others could offer their own implementation as time went on.
The interface would need to not only abstract a web server built with .NET,
but also allow for out of framework servers via stubs for NSAPI, ISAPI, and
Apache mod.

&gt;<i>     This will be really superb if we can have this. This will give a big
</I>boost
&gt;<i> to the project.
</I>&gt;<i>     But even without that, we may have a small web-server in place. This
</I>may
&gt;<i> serve as preamble to the runtime for apache / mono_mod.
</I>
I agree that long term we should look into mono_mod for Apache, to ease
the deployment, but a lot of the work we do on our own
web-server-in-a-class can just be plugged on such a module.

The rationale for web-server-in-a-class that we were discussing, is that
I would for instance be able to have an application like Gnumeric
&quot;expose&quot; its SOAP end-point *in the desktop*.  That way local
applications could talk and manipulate the application locally.
