<PRE>I'm not even going to pretend to be qualified to give this question the answer it deserves.

What I would remind you of is that we are seeing the first version of .NET, and there is already talk of ILX to help accomodate functional languages, and the possibility of generic templates in future versions of .NET

My point being that while there may initialy be difficulties in implementing for languages at present, that isn't to say the design pattern is flawed (I realise you're not implying this), and many people (at large, not yourself), should reconsider their expectations of a version 1.0 product release / technology.

My personal hope is that mix-ins get added at some point, as I don't see them adding any problems single inheritence is intended to side-step.

I suspect at some point that MS/ECMA may give in and simply add multiple inheritence, bt that's wild speculation on my part without even any rumour to found it on.

Lastly you might want to check out Haskell.NET as I seem to recall that it uses a rather funky dispatch mechanism that differs from the .NET norm in order to implement Haskell, the result of which is there is special consideration that must be given when calling Haskell code from non-Haskell code... I may have misunderstood thinsg however.

Cheers,
	Guy.

This article suggests it would be impossible to write an Objective-C or TOM compiler for .NET or any .NET clones. Can anybody clarify this issue?
