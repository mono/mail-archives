<PRE>I'm sorry Rafael, I only just saw your email. I hope I'm not treading on
anyone's toes here.

I've been playing around with the a little today. What I've done is
still a little rudimentary, it's mostly something I've wanted to try to
do for a while. It's basically just a collapsible tree echoing the
structure of the XML.

Anyway, it's all in the attached .tar.gz, I've included a .htm file
which is the result of running 'cscript /nologo transform.js &gt;
cormissing.htm' on a win32 machine with a reasonably recent version of
MSXML installed.

I'm going to add buttons to do simple filtering, eg: 'show only TODOs',
'hide completed', etc...

Piers.

Richard,

I've pretty much completed CorCompare so that it outputs the xml of all
the missing and todo data for classes and their members.  If you get the
latest from cvs and do a make, you find the resulting xml in
mcs/tools/corcompare/cormissing.xml.

Have you done any work yet on the XSLT?  If not, are you able to spare
some cycles for it soon?  If not, I'll likely try my hand at it
(although my XSLT skills aren't so sharp :)


Question for Miguel:

How would you like these html pages organized?  I'm assuming you'll want
to put static HTML pages on the website?  No fancy cgi scripts creating
them dynamically, I guess; just a batch generator of some kind. But,
where should the pages go?

I'm also assuming you'll want the generator to be something currently
Linux friendly, like a perl script or some such.  Unfortunately, my perl
skills are about nil. So, someone else will need to make that or wait
for me to learn perl :)

Regards,
Nick D.
