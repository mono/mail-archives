Subject: [Mono-list] Re: Contributing non .NET libraries


:<i> Very nice!  I would like to know more about this.  It seems like this is
</I>:<i> complementary to the work that Gaurav was proposing.  .NETMail seems to
</I>:<i> be a transport/delivery mechanism, while Gaurav's is more of a Mime/RFC
</I>:<i> framework for creating/extracting these messages.
</I>
    That's right.
    Till now, I have been able to work around with only API for the Messaging
part. Still not touched Transport and Store part. It would be very nice if we
could work in complement, unless of course we've already developed any of the
parts independently. Would like to go through any coding that you may have done
and/or any architecture that has been designed / in process of designing. That
will help interfacing the various components.

:<i> As I suggested Gaurav, for any code that is not part of the Microsoft
</I>:<i> API, we should create extra assemblies.  It is perfectly fine if our
</I>:<i> assemblies do depend on the extra ones.
</I>
    I think, that is going to be the criterion now. So, we may be have assembly
named Mono.Mail if we have Mail in a separate assembly. Miguel may be relieved
off thinking of a name ;-)
    If we combine the Web-server efforts with this, we may have something like
Mono.Internet - sounds crazy?
