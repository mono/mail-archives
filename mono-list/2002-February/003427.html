	Yes of course and since you know Java, you will have that sense of deja

	Umm, this is definitely not the C# _compiler_ for Mono - what we are
trying to do is write the parser-generator so that it generates C# code
which does the parsing. Currently, Miguel's port of Jay to generate C#
code works pretty well and what we are trying to do is only replace Jay
- nothing else !


	Nick wants you to keep in mind that jb2csharp should be able to
generate Java code for the parser if necessary and this should be
through a command-line switch. Nobody here is trying to replace Jikes
;-)


&gt;<i> present compiler. I would like to write this parser in C# so that it can
</I>&gt;<i> bootstrap with the rest of the compiler. This is my thoughts so far.
</I>
	Write the parser is C# ? Oh no, there's no need for that at all :-) I
imagine jb2csharp is written in C and you probably want to stick to
that. You only want to emit the parser by generating C# code. That's all
we need.


	So I suppose you could do the following :


	* Poke around in jb2csharp [read sources etc]

	* See how Jay is currently used inside mcs [cs-parser.jay etc] 

	* Hack on jb2csharp so that we can effectively replace jay with
jb2csharp :-)



	Thanks very much for your enthusiasm on this - this is certainly on one
of the long-term TODO lists of the compiler :-)


	Regards,

		Ravi
