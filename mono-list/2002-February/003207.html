mixins which carry implementation is used in dynamic languages such as Ruby
with very great results since objects aren't distinguised by (class)type
(methods can be added during runtime etc) but by what messages it responds to.
Some surely argues that this somehow breaks encapsulation but providing one
basic funcion (like each in Ruby) and using a mixin which uses this once
interface to provide a wide range of functions (eg Enumerable mixin in Ruby)
is a very powerfull concept for languages like Ruby.

If the CLR (I know little of the CLR yet..) doesn't support this kind of
behaviour then dynamic languages such as Ruby will have a hard time
socializing in the .NET framework - or have I gotten something wrong?

As you might have suspected I am interested in a Ruby.NET - could anyone
comment on things that would be problematic for such a project or why it would
be feasible?
