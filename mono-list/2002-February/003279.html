<PRE>Cool. I started dinking with this over the weekend. I thought I'd share what
I've found so far:

For pkg-config, I just downloaded and installed Fink.

For glib, I didn't see anything but the 1.2 dist in Fink out there for OS X,
so I tried to compile the 1.3.13 source tarball. Here's what I did to make
that work:

- I had to replace config.guess (It couldn't guess the OS type, I just
copied the one in the mono-0.8 tarball over.)

- I set up CPPFLAGS with &quot;-no-cpp-precomp&quot; like you'd mentioned, and also
added &quot;-I/sw/include&quot; dir to look for headers in the fink distro. Also set
up LDFLAGS with &quot;-L/sw/lib&quot;.

- In &quot;glib/gdir.c&quot;, an additional include was needed for stdint.h.

- Libtool was generated to include &quot;-undefined suppress&quot; to suppress
errors/warnings, which bombs in 10.1 now. I removed that.

That seemed to build everything up to the &quot;tests&quot; target, which built but
didn't link due to some unresolved symbols in module (I think).

I didn't get much farther than that. I tried to kick off the mono build
(from the 0.8 source tarball). It got up to the point where it wanted to
find PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE in pthread.h, which I've noticed that you'd
posted a workaround for in an earlier thread for non-glibc systems. I was
going to take a gander at that next. Was also going to go back and see if I
can get the tests to compile for glib, to make sure it regresses okay.

Thanks,
Ryan
