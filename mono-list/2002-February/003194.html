 &gt; 
 &gt; Mixins shouldn't bring implementation either, else you break encapsulation
 &gt; (there's a great rant on this in Gang of Four). If the Objective-C people
 &gt; can't understand good OO design, then it's no suprise it never took off.
 &gt; 
 &gt; In any case the CLR is designed to avoid that by making its requirement of
 &gt; multiply inherited classes be abstract, so if you want broken OO via impure
 &gt; Mixins, I wouldn't expect the CLR to ever support that. ILX would still
 &gt; support the CLR notion of single inheritance, multiple interfaces.

You're talking about interfaces, not mixins.  The term came from the
Flavors object system for Lisp, and mixins *do* come with
implementations.  They're little classes that aretn't terribly useful
by themselves, but when mixed in with a substantial class, add
functionality.
