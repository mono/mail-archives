This article is interesting in that it points to some limitations in
Microsoft's implementation of the CLR, pitfalls that Mono should try
to avoid.

     * Implement tailcall efficiently. MS CLR has a very slow
       implementation. This (almost) gives you efficient
       continuations. 

     * box/unbox should use tagged pointers in some cases,
       particularly integers. With tailcalls, this improves
       performance of continuations.

     * instanceof and castclass should have a very fast path in the
       case where an object *is* type T. Furthermore, ORP, I think,
       implemented a faster check for type inheritance. This will make
       collection classes faster. Done well, plus box/unbox
       improvement above, I think it would make &quot;type erasure&quot;
       implementation of generics nearly as fast as any real runtime
       support.

     * The Reflection classes are quite painful for dynamic
       languages. It's slow, cumbersome, and limited. I'm partial to
       UPenn's extension to Cornell's Cyclone for runtime code
       generation (not implemented in the current version). There is
       probably an analogue for the CLR. Microsoft's Reflection APIs
       can be built on top of that. 

     * Dynamic assemblies are too static. In particular, many
       languages view code (methods) as just another datastructure,
       which should be dropped when noone refers to it. There ought to
       be a way to manually tell the runtime to remove a class from a
       dynamic assembly. Suddenly, Lisp's &quot;eval&quot; works!

     * Better yet, implement closures. Here's a chance for open source
       folks to &quot;embrace and extend&quot; Microsoft. Wouldn't that be fun?

     * An interface with the GC that allows me to scan the heap for
       certain types of objects. Many languages need better
       integration with the GC to make whole-program changes. This is
       an easy one.

I can't speak to the limitations of the type system. Frankly, I think
many languages can get around it if these improvements are made. 

There's always the problem, however, of getting MY language to interop
with YOUR language. Noone really has a solution for the general case,
but limited interop with C# can usually be done from most languages.

My 2 cents.

    Paul&gt; This article suggests it would be impossible to write an
    Paul&gt; Objective-C or TOM compiler for .NET or any .NET clones. Can
    Paul&gt; anybody clarify this issue?
