<PRE>Wow, it's still fast even after you prefixed every image URL with
'cormissing_files/' AND turned it into unicode - 670K down to 20K!!

That's getting uncomfortably close to Slashdot on the old
noise-to-signal-ratio scale. ;-)

Me too, I guess. Sorry.

Piers.

All, if you want to see the speed compressed, feel free to try

Piers, I didn't know if you had access to change the Content-Encoding
header on your server.

Cheers,

Joe

Great, thanks Nick.

I've done a nother drop (I'm not going to spam the list with more
binaries):
	<A HREF="http://www.friskit.com/erez/xslt/cormissing.htm">http://www.friskit.com/erez/xslt/cormissing.htm</A>

- It's still huge, sorry...
- It's got the checkboxes instead of the cryptic mouse UI.
- However, I've added more cryptic mouse UI ;-) If you CTRL-click on an
node (not the name!!) it'll expand that node and collapse the rest.
- The names of the nodes themselves (all but the assemblies) are links
to the MSDN docs (thanks Daniel!).


As for the web-site integration: do you know what the mechanism is for
the 'template' process? in theory we could just have an &lt;IFRAME/&gt; since
it's not really going to work on downlevel browsers, but then there's
the whole scrolling mess, ugh.


I also added support for:
	namespace/structs/struct
	namespace/delegates/delegate
	namespace/enumerations/enumeration

(but I still have to do nestedType, oops!)

I'm not sure how easy it would be to work out if a type is derived from
the relevant class, and they may need reparenting as
'namespace/classes/struct', etc... Anyway, it's there if you want.


Piers.

|<i> Yeah the resulting file is a little large. I'm not sure about the best
</I>
|<i> way to split it up, maybe we could have the corcompare tool or the 
</I>|<i> deploy script generate separate XML files and do it that way. 
</I>|<i> Alternatively we could just use HTTP compression - it compresses down 
</I>|<i> to about 15K!
</I>
Let's keep it simple at first and just have one BOF (Big 'ol File) for
now.  If people complain because it's too slow or Miguel's dial up is to
slow to push it out to the web :), we can worry about it then.

Let's use Warren's suggestion and make the graphic file names one
letter, and that'll help.  Not sure if collapsed will help, but if it
does, let's do that too.

|<i> I've attached an update (without the .htm, .xml files), there's a demo

|<i> on
</I>|<i> 	<A HREF="http://www.friskit.com/erez/xslt/cormissing.htm">http://www.friskit.com/erez/xslt/cormissing.htm</A>
</I>|<i>
</I>
This is cool.  You are the man.

|<i> I've added a few UI features:
</I>|<i> * The list is sorted alphabetically now
</I>
Good.

[snip]

|<i>   - I'll probably change this to use checkboxes, it just kinda evolved
</I>
|<i> this way ;-)
</I>|<i>
</I>
Let's put the check boxes for missing, todo, and all.  &quot;All&quot; will
uncheck the other two.

|<i> I think it would be nice if the cormissing tool actually included the 
</I>|<i> 'completed' items, too. Then clicking on 'completed' will actually 
</I>|<i> show something ;-)
</I>|<i>
</I>
I was thinking this is just a list of what needs to be done to finish
the corlib. People look here to see what needs love.  I would like to
see this tree get smaller and smaller as time goes on.

That is the mono hacker's point view, of course. End users possibly want
to know the opposite --  What's done that they can use in their
programs. Absence from the tree gives the answer, albeit in a convoluted
way.

What would be really cool is including the completed items, *and* having
the nunit tests marking them for failing tests.  That info is good for
both mono hackers and end users.

So, considering there is already concern about the size of the data, and
there are very few, if any end users right now, I propose we just show
missing and todo items for now.  We can revisit this later when it's
more clear what we need.

|<i> As far as deployment, I think it would be easiest to just dump the 
</I>|<i> xslt directory inside the 'cormissing' CVS directory, create a deploy 
</I>|<i> rule in the Makefile somewhat like:
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i> deploy: CorCompare.exe
</I>|<i> 	cp cormissing.xml xslt
</I>|<i> 	cd xslt
</I>|<i> 	cscript /nologo transform.js &gt; cormissing.htm
</I>|<i> 	rm -f cormissing.xml
</I>|<i> 	cd ..
</I>|<i> 	tar -cvf - xslt | gzip -c &gt; xslt.tar.gz
</I>
Sounds good to me.  However, We need to wrap the tree in the Mono
&quot;template&quot; too.  How should that be done?


Excellent work Piers!


Nick D.
