</I>Let me further explain.  The xml file I mentioned is 652K.  Every diff I 
produce shows a single 652K line deleted, and a single 652K line 
inserted.  Instant 1.3M diff.  That seems like a lot of bandwidth just 
so folks can filter it after they download it.

I spent a little RTFM time on the CVS homepage, and it looks like 
changing this file to a binary file in CVS may do the trick.  Does 
anyone know if that can be done surgically, or do I have to cvs 
remove/add the file?
