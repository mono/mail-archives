Mixins shouldn't bring implementation either, else you break encapsulation
(there's a great rant on this in Gang of Four). If the Objective-C people
can't understand good OO design, then it's no suprise it never took off.

In any case the CLR is designed to avoid that by making its requirement of
multiply inherited classes be abstract, so if you want broken OO via impure
Mixins, I wouldn't expect the CLR to ever support that. ILX would still
support the CLR notion of single inheritance, multiple interfaces.
