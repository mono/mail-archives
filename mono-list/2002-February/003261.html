</I>	I really think converting MONO libs from (L)GPL to X gave the FS world
the wrong impression that MONO is moving the way Jabber INC went (proprietary).
Since I am an active contributer to the DotGNU effort, I was under the 
assumption that the *grass was greener on the other side of GPL*. I or
we thought that maybe with INTEL/HP (rumour?) helping with the libs, you
might be ahead of us.

	Yes Pnetlib is fully under the GPL, but I was under the assumption that
it had the Linking exception. It turns out that Pnet enforces all software
using our mscorlib.dll to be GPL'd. So it might later be LGPL'd. 

	Seems like one up for GPL here. (and I'm a free software guy).
