<PRE>Hi

SharpDevleop .87b is out, mainly a bugfix/stabilize release.
(NAnt, NUnit, NDoc, NZipLib,NCvsLibrary for .NET 1.0 are included too.)

Changelog for this version :
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------
- New features :
 + The &quot;state&quot; of text files is saved &amp; restored. (bookmarks, caret,
Highlighting, buffer properties etc.)

- Old features now working :
 + Project Configuration panels for VB, JScript, Java
 + Drag &amp; Drop
 + The &quot;state&quot; of a combine is saved &amp; restored. (open files, projectscout
view)
 + &quot;Tool Scout&quot; context menu now working
 + Ctrl+U file reloading (now with menuitem in the file menu)
 + Load files &amp; projects with command line arguments

- Bugfixes : + File remove/add (references, resources too) now work
correctly.
                  + When a dirty file is removed from a project no save
dirty file message box appears when
                      the removed file was open and dirty.
                  + Bug related to the error drawer fixed.
                  + Dirty untitled files can be saved with a dialog when the
window closes.
                  + Made the java language module at least functionable,
please if you contribute language bindings
                     develop the language binding to work on your system
with all features :
                         + Compile &amp; Run project
                         + Compile &amp; Run single file
                    After this check that you don't require a &quot;special&quot; path
for you compiler or virtual machine executer.
                    Then write down the requirements (like compiler x in the
path). This makes the things more easy for people
                    who are using the language binding.
                 + Tools menu now working under other operating systems than
                    WindowsXP
                 + Bug with the tools menu fixed (${Assembly} as argument
didn't
                    work correctly)

                + Included bugfixes from Tyson S. Maxwell :
                    - the curly brace insertion should not insert
uneccessary
                       braces to the code.
                    - The find dialog has per default the current selected
text as
                       the find pattern
                + Brace highlighting now works better (it recognices now
braces
                    in strings or comments
                + Bug with encoding fixed (should now run under Win98) ... I
need
                   feedback from people who use this with double wide
characters, if
                   it works.

- Syntax Highlighting:
               + Added PHP contribution from Chad Smith
               + Added C++ highlighting

- Internal Changes :
               + Formatting strategies (SmartIndenter etc.) added to the
tree, now
                   they're language dependend.
               + Workbench Layout is now added to the tree, now it is
possible to
                  define own layout managers for the workbench.
              + Changed the language binding definition, now it is more easy
to create or change language bindings.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------

The new addin structure which was introduced in .87 makes it easy to extend
SharpDevelop in almost
any possible way. I could need help in almost any area of the project. It
should be relative easy to understand
the SharpDevelop core system and you may learn a bit about software
engineering and programming in
general. Feel free to join the project.
