Hi,
I'm sure there are a bunch of people out there frustrated with this
Cygwin deal.
I've wasted two nights now trying to get mono to compile using the
directions on the Download page.

I had planned to put those two nights into good use and contribute to
the Class Library. I'm doing a fresh install of EVERYTHING. 

* Fresh Win2K Install
* Installed Cygwin with Latest Auto* tools.
* Installed the ZIPs of precompiled glib and pkgconig
* Copied pkg.m4 from 
  /usr/local/share/aclocal/pkg.m4
  to
  /usr/autotool/devel/share/aclocal
* Tried to compile mono, complained about missing gmodule.h from 
  loader.c. So now I have to go compile glib myself :(
* Tried compiling, configure complained about missing libiconv.
  Got the source but I don't have MSVC, so I got the precompiled.
* As per the instructions in README.win32. Copied the iconv.h file
  to /usr/include and the stuff in src/ to /usr/local/lib. 
  Also moved libiconv.a to /lib.
* glib still complains about iconv. So I'm trying 
  ./configure --with-libiconv=no, didn't work. Gave up on compiling glib
:<i>(
</I>* copied gmodule.h into /usr/include and tried compiling mono again,
gave me error about 'g_win32_ftruncate' being previously declared in
/glbn/gwin32.h

I'm tired, I'm sure a ton of people are compiling on Cygwin, what am I
missing?

Thanks
Ahmad
