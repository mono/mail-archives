<PRE>&gt;<i> The plan was to develop something like this also to generate the C structures
</I>&gt;<i> from corlib of some objects, like the reflection ones used in
</I>&gt;<i> reflection.h.
</I>
That's interesting, I'll have a look at what I can do with that.
  
&gt;<i> I think only corlib should have internal calls, the other asseblies
</I>&gt;<i> should be mostly independent of the actual runtime, I guess.
</I>
This would be nice. But looking at the MS assemblies, some low-level classes
are not in the corlib (System.Net.Sockets springs to mind). So it looks like
it's going to have to be the corlib and a minimal selection of System
assemblies.

&gt;<i> I think the tool is useful (it was already planned), so you can commit
</I>&gt;<i> it in cvs, but I'd wait to deploy it until we have mcs and corlib
</I>&gt;<i> compiling on Linux, since otherwise it may cause build problems
</I>&gt;<i> for some people.
</I>
Yeah it's definitely not something to integrate straight away. But I'd like to
just leave it hanging around to see if you guys who are actually writing the
internal calls find it useful. Eventually I guess you'll move the internal call
implementations from metadata to a seperate icall directory, at which point it
becomes useful.

As you say, corlib completion is the probably number one priority at the
moment. Talking of which, is there any list of the critical classes that are
missing for this?

Thanks,
  Dan.
