<PRE>&gt;<i> No not necessarily. If it has CLR support, then as a construct (note, not a class construct) then there's absolutely no reason why it has to inherit from root, or be instantiattable.
</I>
I disagree. Mixins would have to subclass System.Object, otherwise an
object of type &quot;mixin&quot; wouldn't be an Object, and wouldn't be able to be
stored in Collections, etc. You'd end up with the mess Java currently
has, where not everything is an Object. This is to be avoided.

Are we agreed, however, that as long as we *assume* (a) multiple
inheritance is bad and (b) every class should be of type Object, then it
follows that mixins are also bad?
