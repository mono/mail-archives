<PRE>Hi

I've been talking this weekend in Brussels with Miguel about the ADO.NET
implementation in Mono, and I think I've got everything clear now. So
here are my conclusions, please correct/add whatever you want.

* Miguel asked me if it were possible to use the data access
infrastructure of libgda without the need of all the CORBA dependencies
(bonobo, bonobo-activation, ORBit). This is perfectly possible, although
some changes would be needed in libgda itself. Another solution for the
dependency problem could be to have the System.Data.OleDb assembly
distributed separately from the base class library, for instance, as
part of libgda itself.

* Instead of doing a System.Data.Gda namespace, we could implement
System.Data.OleDb in linux based on libgda. The interface for connecting
is almost exactly the same in OleDb and libgda, so there won't be any
big problem that we can't resolve for letting people just move their
apps from windows to linux and have them work without any change at all.
Then, on windows, we can make easily an implementation of
System.Data.OleDb based on the OleDb libraries available on the windows
platform.

BTW, I've also been looking at the classes to be implemented for this,
and the mapping between those classes and the libgda API is, in most
cases, straightforward.

* the rest of the ADO.NET classes are implemented in C#, without any
need of libgda whatsoever. This is what Chris is doing, isnt' it?

cheers
