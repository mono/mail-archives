<PRE>&gt;<i> Hello t3rmin4t0r (if that is indeed your real name),
</I>	The original mail had my name at the end.(as does this mail).
&gt;<i> While your input on the subject of Mono-proejct development would certainly
</I>&gt;<i> be welcome here, Microsoft-bashing is not productive.  
</I>	I'm not a microsoft basher PERIOD. But the original comment was
aimed at the opressive &quot;EULA&quot; of Microsoft. (hey can't you take a joke ?).
&gt;<i> For your information, though, a quick read of the EULA packaged with the
</I>&gt;<i> .NET SDK as provided by Microsoft, reveals no limitations on testing or
</I>&gt;<i> benchmarking.
</I>	Please read the following from .NET EULA
||<i> 6.	Performance or Benchmark Testing. You may not disclose the results of 
</I>||<i> any benchmark test of either the Server Software or Client Software to 
</I>||<i> any third party without Microsoft's prior written approval.
</I>	What are benchmarks for if you can't tell me what happened ?. MS found
this as a convenient way of avoiding Mono vs .NET runtime tests. (does that
concern Mono ?). [ &quot;Prior approval&quot; =&gt; souped up tests ]
||<i> This Agreement will terminate without notice upon the commercial release 
</I>||<i> of the Product.  Upon the termination of this Agreement, Recipient shall 
</I>||<i> promptly return to Microsoft, or certify destruction of, all full or 
</I>||<i> partial copies of the Product provided by Microsoft.  
</I>	So VS.NET commercially released this month Feb-13 for $ 1,079. Does 
that mean that .NET has been commercially released ?. (that's an ACE up 
someone's sleeve).

	Also , I didn't mean to start a flame war. I just happened to be a 
hacker who reads EULAs and takes them seriously.

Gopal.V

PS: all the above quotes are Microsoft.com , I don't know if they shipped
    .NET with a different license. (I haven't got Windows).
