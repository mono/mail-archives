<PRE>Perhaps the danger of flooding will evaporate as soon as MCS is capable of
compiling rafts.  Given the progress made so far, as an outsider I would
guess that this will be sometime in July.  Until then Life-jackets are the
best bet.  Maybe gzip could inflate one?
  But if it is truly Mono that is causing flooding, then I think the entire
open source movement may go down the drain.  Except for open source seafood
trading. (Fish .NET ?).

&gt;<i> Yes, it is sadly true.  Participating in the Mono project can indeed
</I>result
&gt;<i> in massive and expensive flooding.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps you doubt this.  You say to yourself, how can something as
</I>innocuous
&gt;<i> as reading a mailing list and looking at C# code cause such disaster?
</I>Allow
&gt;<i> me to detail my experience, which proves beyond a shadow of a doubt the
</I>&gt;<i> incredible risk that readers of this newsgroup face daily.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Today, I decided not to go out for lunch to any of the nearby eateries,
</I>and
&gt;<i> instead I would munch on snacks at work and spend my time catching up on
</I>&gt;<i> mono-list traffic.  That fatal decision made, I walked to the company
</I>&gt;<i> kitchen to wash out a bowl I use for tasty delicacies such as Ramen
</I>noodles.
&gt;<i> There I discovered that the kitchen sink wasn't getting any hot water.
</I>All
&gt;<i> of this is obviously Mono's fault for keeping my at work on my lunch
</I>break,
&gt;<i> but it gets even worse.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As the responsible corporate employee that I am, I dutifully sent off a
</I>&gt;<i> quick email to our facilities manager to look into the hot water, and
</I>&gt;<i> settled in to read mono-list.  Suddenly, in the middle of the &quot;Setting
</I>mono
&gt;<i> in LinuxPPC&quot; thread, we hear a splash in the kitchen.  Moments later a
</I>&gt;<i> broadcast email goes out to all company employees to avoid the kitchen due
</I>&gt;<i> to a water problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, sadly, in attempting to fix the hot water, building maintenance
</I>&gt;<i> mistakenly caused a water leak that resulted in turning our kitchen area
</I>&gt;<i> into a  small (25-foot) pond, and trapping our poor CEO in his office,
</I>&gt;<i> hemmed in by water on all sides.  I just hope it didn't get the floor
</I>&gt;<i> beneath us too wet, since we're on the 9th floor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Clearly, _ALL_ Mono participants are at risk for similar disasters.  I for
</I>&gt;<i> one would push for a Mono fire and water-hazard awareness FAQ, to increase
</I>&gt;<i> list awareness of the dangers, and to offer a support-group for the
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunate injured and maimed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
