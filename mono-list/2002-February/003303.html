<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Not really Java already believes that &quot;everything's an object, except
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when it's not&quot;, this just adds to that confusion. Yes, that's right. Jam
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mixins are not first-class types. It's a silly idea, and shows the sort
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of thing that's likely to happen when you retrofit a feature on an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; infrastructure designed to make it difficult to implement that feature.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> BTW the seminal paper detailing the benefits of mixin inheritance was
</I>&gt;<i> co-written by a man named Gilad Bracha. You may have heard of him -- he
</I>&gt;<i> maintains the Java Language Specification, and is currently spearheading the
</I>&gt;<i> Java generics project at Sun :)
</I>
Is this the Java generics specification derided by Grady Booch as
&quot;laughable and amateurish&quot;? Shurely some mistake?
