<PRE>Hi Miguel,

&gt;<i> &gt; Disagree. The VB.NET language (which MonoBASIC is designed to
</I>&gt;<i> compile) is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *almost* C# with a VB-derived syntax. I suspect that that there
</I>&gt;<i> is a great
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; deal more similarity once you get past the lexer/scanner than there are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; differences. If we were talking about earlier versions of VB,
</I>&gt;<i> you [probably]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be right.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The semantic rules are going to be different, and I am not planning on
</I>&gt;<i> having millions of:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	if (this_is_vb)
</I>&gt;<i> 		...
</I>&gt;<i> 	else
</I>&gt;<i> 		...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the code, that just makes the code ugly and unmaintainable.  And
</I>&gt;<i> whenever there is a difference, you will pay a high price for keeping
</I>&gt;<i> the compatibility.
</I>
This is just a code refactoring issue Miguel, isn't it?.

&gt;<i> Again, the MCS goals, are very similar to Gnumeric: maintainability
</I>&gt;<i> comes first.  Performance comes later.
</I>
Code refactoring coupled with judicious application of flexible design
patterns should allow us to have both in this particular scenario.

&gt;<i> &gt; What sort of differences in semantic analysis have you encountered or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; foreseen that strongly suggest splitting the compilers?. I
</I>&gt;<i> haven't looked at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mcs in detail for a while but there is a great deal of value in having a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; framework that allows for multiple compiler front-ends to share an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; increasingly sophisticated back-end. Or back-ends, in due course...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With the CIL there is not much of a backend.  Specially considering that
</I>&gt;<i> we will be writing a CIL optimizer that will perform optimizations on a
</I>&gt;<i> CIL .EXE image independently of what compiler was used to generate the
</I>&gt;<i> code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The CIL defines where the front-end has to stop.  And there is no moving
</I>&gt;<i> there really.
</I>
Your analysis is right of course for current state of affairs. But, if mcs
supports many languages (and easy addition of others) and it's design is
clean/extensible enough, some enterprising soul might just step up to the
challenge.....perhaps a native executable code generator (perhaps by reusing
gcc's back end only)?
