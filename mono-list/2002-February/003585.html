<PRE>Hello All,

Just wanted to let anyone who might be interested know what is going on with 
the Qt c# bindings.  Tonight, I was finally able to compile the bindings for 
476 Qt classes.  The hello world example is now referencing this compiled 
dll.  Slots and Signals are also fully implemented and all of this running on 
linux with mint and mono.  mcs is not able to compile the bindings _yet_ 
although I have been able to exercise mcs a little and point out some bugs 
;-) There are still quite a few tasks before the qt bindings will be useful 
for real development:

1.  No way to extend the qt classes _yet_ (this is next)
2.  Several Qt classes are missing methods and constructors because...
3.  The type mappings are not completely fleshed out
4.  No kde classes

Well, I can envision these bindings ready for some practical development very 
soon as well as providing some scaffolding for Windows.Forms in the not to 
distant future.

Ok, I am exhausted and I'm flying across the country in the morning so...

Cheers,

Adam
