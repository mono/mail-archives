I first need to get my hands on the language specification for C#. I
will need to read that first before I begin.
 
&gt;<i> In particular there's one part where JB takes the &quot;goto&quot; statements from

</I>
Goto I thought was only a Basic programming keyword. I have not seen it
used in C/C++/Java. This repeats the necessity to read the language
specs.

&gt;<i> The goal definitely needs to be &quot;add C# support, but keep Java support
</I>&gt;<i> as well&quot;.  In the end I imagine some sort of command line switch to
</I>&gt;<i> select which language you want it to generate with, just like lex does
</I>&gt;<i> with C/C++.
</I>
If we are making this to be the C# compiler for mono I don't think its
in our best interest to play with Java. Java has an already good
compiler from IBM called Jikes. Jikes is fast. No sense in re-inventing
the wheel.

&gt;<i> The last thing I ran into when I was working on it was this: Parsing the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;.&quot; separated items and finding a &quot;(&quot; or not was not so easy the way it
</I>&gt;<i> was written.  I don't remember exactly the problem, but if you play
</I>&gt;<i> around with a grammar and actions beyond the calc compiler, I'm sure
</I>&gt;<i> you'll run into it and you'll know what I'm talking about.
</I>
Your are right. The grammar is the place I need to start. Fortunately I
am taking a compilers course as a part of my Masters program. The steps
as I see it is to learn the grammar. After which I figure how to put
into C#. I have experience with doing actions with Java CUP parser. 

&gt;<i> I say, go for it if your interested.  I'll be happy to help out if your
</I>&gt;<i> eager to work on it.  Should I add you to the SourceForge project?  If
</I>&gt;<i> so, let me know your SF.net username.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I need to talk with Ravi and Miguel about how to do this part with the
present compiler. I would like to write this parser in C# so that it can
bootstrap with the rest of the compiler. This is my thoughts so far.
