<PRE>&gt;<i>  &gt; In any case the CLR is designed to avoid that by making its requirement of
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; multiply inherited classes be abstract, so if you want broken OO via impure
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; Mixins, I wouldn't expect the CLR to ever support that. ILX would still
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; support the CLR notion of single inheritance, multiple interfaces.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You're talking about interfaces, not mixins.  The term came from the
</I>&gt;<i> Flavors object system for Lisp, and mixins *do* come with
</I>&gt;<i> implementations.  They're little classes that aretn't terribly useful
</I>&gt;<i> by themselves, but when mixed in with a substantial class, add
</I>&gt;<i> functionality.

Which from a modern OO perspective is a Very Bad Thing. Which is why
neither Java nor C# support them.

To achieve what you want without breaking encapsulation, use the
decorator pattern. Again if refer to Gang of Four.
