<PRE>I only signed up originally to write some of the classes - I didn't plan then 
on writing the parser itself.  What really needs writing is a parser - I 
started working on one, but it's a huge job and, without any help, I quickly 
ran out of motivation.

I started porint the code from OpenXML 2.3.17 (a delphi implementation  
<A HREF="http://www.philo.de/xml/">http://www.philo.de/xml/</A>), and a lot of the support code, like code page 
stuff, is in there.  There's also the beginnings of the parser.

The parser design is non-trivail, especially when you start factoring in DTD 
and schema support (and namespaces, and.....)  It would be nice if we could 
get just a well-formedness parser running to actually start testing the class 
implementations, though.

Feel free to throw as much love as possible at the classes, they need 
some....
