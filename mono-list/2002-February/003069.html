Uhm, you're right.

System.Convert needs finishing. TypeDelegate needs some work as well.
A part from that stuff, the most needed things are tests:
tests for the integer and floating parsing routines, tests for delgates,
tests for array sorting and other array operations. Tests for
stringbuilder, hashtable, arraylist.
We need tests for the stream and text writer/readers.
We need to go through the current implementation of the methods you get
with monodis --memberref mcs.exe and check that it behaves according to
the documentation.
When that is done, we need to run mcs against as many tests as possible
and fix the issues that come up, because most of the issues are bugs
more than missing bits.
I know that some of these tests already exists, but until I get nunit
working on linux they don't help much, since they either can tests only
some high level stuff or we get errors because the classes depend on the
mono runtime.
