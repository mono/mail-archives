</I>&gt;<i> Hello!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do you think it is better to abandon our previous design of a single
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; executable capable of compiling many sintaxes? I´ve already
</I>&gt;<i> merged MonoBASIC
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code with the Feb-10 snapshot and it is working, albeit still
</I>&gt;<i> lacking true
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MonoBASIC compiling.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is funny that you bring this up, because I just fired you an e-mail
</I>&gt;<i> about this precise subject.  For the sake of those reading the mailing
</I>&gt;<i> list, I believe that having two compilers share the current driver will
</I>&gt;<i> not work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Visual Basic and C# have vastly different semantic analysis
</I>&gt;<i> requirements, and different ways of generating code, so at this point I
</I>&gt;<i> am very skeptical of using the C# code base as the VB compiler code
</I>&gt;<i> base.
</I>
Disagree. The VB.NET language (which MonoBASIC is designed to compile) is
*almost* C# with a VB-derived syntax. I suspect that that there is a great
deal more similarity once you get past the lexer/scanner than there are
differences. If we were talking about earlier versions of VB, you [probably]
would be right.

What sort of differences in semantic analysis have you encountered or
foreseen that strongly suggest splitting the compilers?. I haven't looked at
mcs in detail for a while but there is a great deal of value in having a
framework that allows for multiple compiler front-ends to share an
increasingly sophisticated back-end. Or back-ends, in due course...

It reduces the TTM for adding new languages to Mono. Perhaps, what is needed
is a re-factoring of msc to have explicit interface for plugging in
different implementations of pretty much everything. This should cater for
extensions/implementations that are compiled into mcs.exe as well as those
supplied as stand-alone or external assemblies.
