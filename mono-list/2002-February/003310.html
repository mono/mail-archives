<PRE>&gt;<i> bringing up

Well, I was not a Comp Sci at Uni. I was a mathematician, so I can be
forgiven for relying on such fundamental mathematical concepts as
Universal Computability and complexity theory. But since you tell me
they are worthless, I'll happily kowtow to the a priori knowledge about
the fundamentality of mathematics that you obviously possess.
