<PRE>&gt;<i> Oh, and if you want more, I can easily think of more tasks that need
</I>&gt;<i> work :-)
</I>
Oh, I want to add something to the list ;-)
(things below are ideal if you have no more than a hour of spare time once a
week :-)

 * cross-compiling;
If you have access to some cross-tools (primarily GNU-based), try to find
and fix related issues. Paolo has fixed some cross-compilation issues, but
it's quite possible that there are more.

* inter-compiler portability;
Try to compile some parts of runtime with bizarre compilers you have access
to and point out related problems (there could be some problems not caught
be ansi/pedantic modes).

* help with StrongARM support;
If you have access to StrongARM or XScale hardware running Linux and some
spare time, please contact me :-)
For those interested I will add ARM support code to CVS this weekend (I just
added delegates support to it);


BTW, maybe someone is interested to add support for SuperH CPUs?

Thanks,
Sergey
