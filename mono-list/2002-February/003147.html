<PRE>I know I'm a bit slow to be replying to this, but I've been behind on my
email.  I have to catch up o a few days worth of mailing lists =)

I have one suggestion:
Make sure that the configure script detects for glib-1.3.  I personally
don't want multiple copies of the library on my computer when I don't
need it.  (I don't even want to know how many copies of Wine are lying
around on my system... find a couple more every time I look.)

This way, you can install your &quot;glib2-lite&quot; for thouse w/o glib2, but
those of us with glib2 installed won't have 2 copies of it.

(You may have been thinking about this, but I just thought I should
point it out.)

</I>&gt;<i>     Mono 0.8 has been released.  The main difference between this and

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     The compiler can not yet self-host on Linux, as there are still

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Where can you get the goodies?

</I>&gt;<i> 		<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mcs-0.8.tar.gz">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mcs-0.8.tar.gz</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     There are so many new things since version 0.7, that it is hard to
</I>&gt;<i> know where to start.  But we got the compiler that can compile itself
</I>&gt;<i> (and I have been hard at work making it emit every possible error
</I>&gt;<i> message on earth, so that it is not only a compiler, but a useful
</I>&gt;<i> development tool), a JIT engine for Linux/x86 systems and an interpreter
</I>&gt;<i> that works on Linux/PPC systems.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     No other systems have been tested on this release, but we welcome
</I>&gt;<i> contributions.  Sergey's StrongARM port has not been integrated, but
</I>&gt;<i> Paolo's patches to cross compile Mono are included.  The compiler `mcs'
</I>&gt;<i> can compile a quite a few applications on Linux, but nothing really
</I>&gt;<i> major ones (it cant compile itself yet), if you want to help, again
</I>&gt;<i> there are many bugs in our classes that need to be ironed out.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     We have also built an IO layer into our runtime that emulates the IO
</I>&gt;<i> model in Windows, because this model is exposed to the class library
</I>&gt;<i> user, so it has to be done.  One advantage is that you can &quot;select/poll&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> for both file descriptors and mutexes.  Sweet!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     In this release, we of course include all the source code to the
</I>&gt;<i> class libraries (and that juicy Regex engine is in there, the WebForms
</I>&gt;<i> classes, System.Reflection and Reflection Emit, as well as piles of work
</I>&gt;<i> on making all our object serializable and support all the exceptions in
</I>&gt;<i> .NET). 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    There is still a long road to go, but I have been putting off this
</I>&gt;<i> release since December 5th, so here it is.  Hopefully I should be making
</I>&gt;<i> releases more often, for those of you curious as to what we are doing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Also, there are test suites for the compiler, the runtime and the
</I>&gt;<i> class libraries.  The class library tests fail all over the place: an
</I>&gt;<i> indication that you can be part of this whole open source thing and help
</I>&gt;<i> fix the bugs ;-).  The compiler and runtime pass their tests though.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Now, the bad news is that you will need pkgconfig and glib 1.3 to
</I>&gt;<i> compile and install Mono, you can get these from:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	<A HREF="http://www.freedesktop.org/software/pkgconfig">http://www.freedesktop.org/software/pkgconfig</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 	<A HREF="ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v1.3/glib-1.3.12.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v1.3/glib-1.3.12.tar.gz</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Once you compile and install those, you can compile `mono' on Linux. 
</I>&gt;<i> If you wish to recompile the class libraries or work on the compiler,
</I>&gt;<i> you still need to use the .NET Framework on Windows.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     I am considering seriously just copy/pasting the code from
</I>&gt;<i> glib-1.3.12 that we use/require into mono to reduce the number of
</I>&gt;<i> packages that must be compiled. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     We are on the case to fix this.  Promised.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Enjoy,
</I>&gt;<i> Miguel
