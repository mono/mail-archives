</I>&gt;<i>project out of MCS? &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello! &gt; &gt; &gt; Do you think it is better to abandon 
</I>&gt;<i>our previous design of a single &gt; &gt; executable capable of compiling many 
</I>&gt;<i>sintaxes? I´ve already &gt; merged MonoBASIC &gt; &gt; code with the Feb-10 snapshot 
</I>&gt;<i>and it is working, albeit still &gt; lacking true &gt; &gt; MonoBASIC compiling. &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i>It is funny that you bring this up, because I just fired you an e-mail &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i>about this precise subject. For the sake of those reading the mailing &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i>list, I believe that having two compilers share the current driver will &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i>not work. &gt; &gt; Visual Basic and C# have vastly different semantic analysis &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i>requirements, and different ways of generating code, so at this point I &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i>am very skeptical of using the C# code base as the VB compiler code &gt; base.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Disagree. The VB.NET language (which MonoBASIC is designed to compile) is 
</I>&gt;<i>*almost* C# with a VB-derived syntax. I suspect that that there is a great 
</I>&gt;<i>deal more similarity once you get past the lexer/scanner than there are 
</I>&gt;<i>differences. If we were talking about earlier versions of VB, you 
</I>&gt;<i>[probably] would be right.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What sort of differences in semantic analysis have you encountered or 
</I>&gt;<i>foreseen that strongly suggest splitting the compilers?. I haven't looked 
</I>&gt;<i>at mcs in detail for a while but there is a great deal of value in having a 
</I>&gt;<i>framework that allows for multiple compiler front-ends to share an 
</I>&gt;<i>increasingly sophisticated back-end. Or back-ends, in due course...
</I>
Well, I´m duplicating mcs to mbas, trying to keep it capable of compiling 
both languages. Some things must be added/changed like supporting 
case-insensitive resolution of symbols, for MonoBASIC´s sake.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It reduces the TTM for adding new languages to Mono. Perhaps, what is 
</I>&gt;<i>needed is a re-factoring of msc to have explicit interface for plugging in 
</I>&gt;<i>different implementations of pretty much everything. This should cater for 
</I>&gt;<i>extensions/implementations that are compiled into mcs.exe as well as those 
</I>&gt;<i>supplied as stand-alone or external assemblies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Kunle
</I>
Also refactoring many of the structural classes is in the plans: my home 
version already switches parsers based on file extension, but more is 
needed, like achieving unbiased error messages and/or parameterized error 
messages.

Also higher level semantics like Generics (Parameterized classes), Multiple 
Inheritance, Closures, ... will have classes/interfaces in the backend to 
expedite adding new languages...

Happy hackings...
