I see a few problems with this:

1. it forces more dependencies on Mono, which I think we are trying to
eliminate more than add-on if we can.

2. the thread issues have already been fixed by me ;-)

3. generic Portable Runtimes, in my experience, tend to bloat things out
a lot and often become fairly inefficient because of all the abstraction
(and this will be a very Bad Thing for mono if we want it to run any
sizable application in the future). I haven't seen APR so I could be
wrong here, my experience mostly lies with NSPR.

4. abstractions tend to eliminate &quot;rarely used&quot; stuff and there seems to
be a fair bit of rarely-used stuff in the io-layer in mono (stuff that I
had never even known existed in ioctl calls).

5. Other than the io-layer and threads stuff, there hasn't been too much
a problem with anything else afaik. Since these issues have been solved
(at least for the time being), it's not a huge issue I don't think.

IMHO, a very thin low-level abstraction layer is ideal in the case of
mono, which is what we've currently got (io-layer, mono-mutex, etc). Too
much abstraction and it becomes more of a drawback than a help.
