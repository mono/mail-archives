<PRE>&gt;<i> Not really Java already believes that &quot;everything's an object, except
</I>&gt;<i> when it's not&quot;, this just adds to that confusion. Yes, that's right. Jam
</I>&gt;<i> mixins are not first-class types. It's a silly idea, and shows the sort
</I>&gt;<i> of thing that's likely to happen when you retrofit a feature on an
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure designed to make it difficult to implement that feature.
</I>
BTW the seminal paper detailing the benefits of mixin inheritance was
co-written by a man named Gilad Bracha. You may have heard of him -- he
maintains the Java Language Specification, and is currently spearheading the
Java generics project at Sun :)
