It's not meant as a troll. It's meant to serve as a reminder of the
ludicrousness of the &quot;Language foo can't be compiled to IL because it
doesn't have feature bar&quot; arguments. I merely wish to reiterate that
they are spurious.

As Miguel pointed out, it's the inherently unsafe nature of ObjC
programs that is likely to be a bar to ObjC.NET, not the fact the CLR
inheritance model doesn't support mixins.
