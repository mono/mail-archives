<PRE>Cool thanks!

I have tested it on IE, Mozilla and Opera. It should work fine on IE &amp;
Mozilla and it should render okay on Opera's, however Opera's DOM
support just doesn't cut it I'm afraid. Nice banner ads, though...

Unfortunately we can't let the browser do the transform, IE doesn't
necessarily ship with a sufficiently up-to-date version of MSXML, and
Mozilla makes a complete pig's ear of the transform. It'll have to be
done on the server, either at GET-time (maybe a PHP/Perl script can
cache the results until the .xml is touched) or just have the
build/deploy script do this.

I'll tidy up the layout a bit and add the missing counts.

Is there a page that provides browser access to the CVS tree? I'd like
to add links from the tree to the source, if possible.

Piers.

Piers,

This is pretty cool.  Does it work in non IE browsers?  I tried it in
Opera on windows and you can collapse/expand (i.e. the + and - are not
links).

Also, there are missing and todo counts available for the assembly and
namespaces too.  Can you add those?  Also the counts are too far to the
right of the class name which makes it hard to pair up visually.  Can
you move those to the left a bit?

Great work. Not at all what I had in mind, but cool just the same. This
should be at least one view of the status.  Maybe we don't even need
separate pages describing the status of each class.  Maybe this is
enough.

It has the advantage that nothing other than the cormissing.xml needs to
be generated in order to update the website.

Does anyone else have an opinion?

Nick D.
