<PRE>
   The NEWS and README.build files in the debugger module in svn  
haven't been updated in a long time, but I see from the logs that  
lots of changes are being made (including amd64 support).

   I just recently build mono from svn and I'm trying to build the  
command line debugger.  I'm not having any luck so far, but I'd sort  
of expect it to work since there is a 'backends/server/powerpc- 
darwin.c' file.

   Any pointers on why this might be failing would be very helpful;  
thanks!

   (HOST_TEXT_START_ADDR doesn't seem to be defined _anywhere_ in the  
source for any platforms, so I sort of assume that this file  
shouldn't be getting built at all)
