<PRE>
I have been communicating with the maintainer of SunFreeWare.com about
creating a package for mono. He told me that he has considered it in the
past, but hasn't done it yet. He is asking for volunteers to beta test a
package for him, if he creates it. He was also asking for some specifics
that are not well laid out on Mono's site. 
Some of the things he needs to know are
1. What are the minimum requirements to compile the base mono runtime
2. What additional requirements are needed to compile mono with ASP.net
and webservices support
3. What additional requirements are needed to compile mono with gui forms
support

If I can get this information to him, I think he is willing to create a
package to place on SunFreeWare.com
