I've been looking around about this same thing.. lighttpd (ask lighty) looks
interesting for the performance side of things.. There are a few features or
modules that aren't implemented yet.. However, if you're just doing a
standalone server with all trusted sites it could maybe pay off two fold..

 

1) claims of better performance (no comment as I've not tested it yet.)

2) utilizing a distributed backend for dynamic pages.. (currently they have
PHP doing this, but I don't see much reason why it couldn't apply to mono as
well.)

3) If nothing else it does produce a much smaller memory footprint (ymmv and
it depends on how well you've tuned apache)

 

If someone is sincerely interested in a lighty module for Mono let me know
and I'll investigate it further..

 

Miguel.... Why IIS?

 

Cheers,

 

C.
