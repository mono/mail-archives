That is correct. gst-sharp is obsolete and unmaintained, and shouldn't
(well, can't) be used. Currently the only non-C bindings for gstreamer
is for python.

&gt;<i> Is there any hard-coding to refer gstreamer-0.8 from gst-sharp, or

</I>
No, gstreamer 0.8 and 0.10 are *very* different, and there's no way
of easy porting current bindings (that's what I've been told, I haven't
tried to port them myself).

That said, you may have a few options. If you just want audio
playback, you may go the Banshee way. Banshee has a helper
C library (libbanshee), which, among other things, conveniently
wraps gstreamer functionality, and presents a simple interface
to the managed side. Libbanshee is stable and works nicely,
so if simple playback is all you want, you've got it.

The other option would be to wait until someone ports gst-sharp
to the newer version, or even try this yourself.

The third option is to use gdv, a C library and accompanying c#
bindings which are the core of the Diva video editing software.
This is highly experimental, there's no stable version as of
yet, not even the release, but you can get the source from svn
and see for yourself :)
