<PRE>&gt;<i> Why IIS?
</I>
Currently, afaik, there are two major webservers, one for Linux (Apache)
other for Windows (IIS). Of couse for windows there is the &quot;real&quot; .Net, but
mono runs on windows, but when talking about web and mono you have only two
choises XSP or Apache.

What about those that have old applications in ASP3 and wish to migrate/use
to mono?

I see many people making a point of view close to:  Windows-Closed Source
and Linux-Open Source. Isn't there a segment in the market that wish to use
Windows but migrate smothly to opensource? The easiest step is to make their
applications run on opensource software, on windows, and only then move to
linux. Again, the example of ASP3 that doesn't run completly on Linux.

Also, mono has only implemented XSP and modmono, that seems pretty
unsuficient to me. If look closely, and/or talk to mono debugger mantainer,
you'll see the debugger is under a large refactoring process because it,
initially, was done with one frontend in mind, when they started to
integrate with other frontends (MonoDevelop for instance) they found that
many things weren't well designed to support that. I suppose that if mono
openned a few more fronts in web servers the same could happen.
