<PRE>Good Day Christopher

 

I am busy developing a new web based application especially for mono called
ECOS (Electronic Component Ordering System). This I am busy developing on
SuSE 10 Linux where I have access to apache2 and MySQL. I am doing this for
a friend whom owns an ISP. The target test server is unfortunately an old
RH9 server running httpd (I understand that this is a very old form of
apache1.x) I have root access via sudo to this box and when I tried to
install mod_mono it complains that it does not find apache.

Good Day 

 

Thank you for the information. If possible could you give me more
information regarding your suggestion?

I've made a few comments in regards to this thread..  I looked at your
website and I think I see what's going on a little..

1) Locked into a larger classic asp app..
2) Tons of security concerns (not to mention the other things that go with
enterprise applications... stability, scalable and of course customer
experience)

If you're considering a migration over to Linux it's a big jump off MS and
there's a lot of planning involved, but from a business perspective and
coming from someone who did it.. I can say the same thing about classic asp
to .Net (It's ultimately very rewarding and profitable on many levels.)

Chilisoft will probably help with moving your classic asp apps over.. I
think I remember some path issues about paths and includes when I used it,
but this is some years ago now and may or may not have changed... (I know
it's been bought and sold during this time as well.)  If you're tied into MS
SQLserver that's another issue as well.. I'm clearly in favour of PostgreSQL
over MySQL any day of the week.. Especially, in any enterprise datacenter..
If somehow I've gotten this all wrong and you're interested in the specific
development of the lightly mono module let me know.. I'm not sure I answered
your question, but let me know what your specific needs are and I'll see if
I can help.

Are you interested in a full app and platform proposal from MS to Linux?

Cheers,
