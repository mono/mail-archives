&gt;<i> The mentioned page has &quot;*dmcs*: Starting with Mono 2.6 this command is the
</I>&gt;<i> C# 4.0 compiler, and references the 4.0 runtime.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Which means dmcs targets 4.0 and not 3.5. What made you think such thing
</I>&gt;<i> so
</I>&gt;<i> we can fix it?
</I>
&quot;The compiler now defaults to the 3.x language specification, starting with
Mono 2.8 it will default to 4.0.&quot;
Since it says that starting with 2.8 it will default to 4.0 I understand
that 2.6 still defaults to 3.x. Anyway, I'm a complete newbie, so maybe a
more experienced person would understand it differently.

&gt;<i> And the problem you're having has nothing to do with the compiler itself,
</I>&gt;<i> it's the class library that doesn't implement the recursive policy on
</I>&gt;<i> ReaderWriteLockSlim. The expection error message is
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;System.NotImplementedException: recursionPolicy != NoRecursion not
</I>&gt;<i> currently implemented&quot;, did you find it not enough informative of the
</I>&gt;<i> fact?
</I>&gt;<i> Any suggestion on how could we improve it?
</I>
Yeah, sorry, I know it's the library, but I thought &quot;mono&quot; was not only the
compiler but that it also included the new libraries, since it says it
references the 4.0 runtime. Again, complete newbie. And a long day.
