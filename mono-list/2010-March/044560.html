Hi,

I'm interested in a mono embedded for Automation and Robotic, but i think
there would be a lot more use for this. I bought a BeagleBoard and i am
currently trying to port the mono source so it can run on it as a kernel but
right now i am going nowhere as i don't fully understand the mono source and
is dependency. What i am trying to put together is a small kernel that will
load a Kernel.dll or Kernel.so find iKernel interface and Start it. No
driver, no console or anything more than base library that can run on a cpu,
but with support for the cpu port (GPIO, UART, SPI, ....). Everything else
is to be done by the user (i also tough about adding interface like iDevice
to help having a standard so people could make driver load them the way they
want and share them and be sure on other people hardware it will still work
with minimal modification).

This is my current project but i don't think i'm gonna be able to do it
alone, right now i am reading as much as i can about kernel, virtual
machine, JIT and .net to better understand what i need to do.

Comment &amp; Help are welcome.
Thanks Madrang.
