<PRE>Hi,

It sounds interesting and novel, though it's not clear to me how the
user would create the anaglyphs. Would they require stereoscopically
separated photographs as an input source?

&gt;<i> I would like to ask how many projects can be made as GTK# applications in

</I>&gt;<i> application can be made at GSoC?
</I>
We will likely pick very few completely stand-alone projects - we
prefer contributions to existing projects as they're much more likely
to be maintained. Perhaps it might work better as an addin for Pinta.
You may also like to submit your proposal to GNOME. Note that you can
also make multiple proposals to Mono, so you can also apply for other
ideas that interest you.
