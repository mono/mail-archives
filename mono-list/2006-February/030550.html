<PRE>I don't know if this has been mentioned before, but could I just report
that SWF DataGrid columns don't appear to be re-sizeable (i.e. I can't
change their width) on Linux as they are on Windows.

 

Having said that, can I also say that I am nothing less than totally
gobsmacked that Mono works so well?  So far I've tried remoting with
SAOs using both metadata and interfaces; ASP.NET, and now data access
from .NET code running on both Windows and Linux.  All my development
has been done in Visual Studio 2003 and everything I've developed has
just worked, with only the most minor of deployment issues.

 

This is a major achievement in my opinion, for which I think the Mono
team deserves a lot of credit.

 

There are a lot of developers walking around with shocked expressions on
their faces here today having just seen C# code developed in VS on
Windows running on Linux and connecting to a MySQL database on a remote
Windows server.  Suddenly we don't need Windows any more: at least not
in this area of our work.

 

Thanks

 

 

Peter
