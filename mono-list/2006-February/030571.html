Peter 

Thanks for the quick reply (and apologies to anyone who has had multiple copies of the original by email as I edited minor details in my initial posting).

I started at the download page &quot;download/fedora-4-i386/&quot; you mention, but took the easy option of &quot;put the mono.repo file in ...&quot; and used yum to install. That could explain why I did not get everything the repo file refers only to  mono-1.1, gtk-sharp 1.0 and 2.0 and mono-tools + mono-deps.

The sources (mono-1.1.13.2-source.tar.gz) were downloaded this morning from the URL you mention - the file is 18,043,178 bytes. I don't understand why we have a difference; I used WinZip to unzip / untar it to a Windows folder on XP (sorry about the lack of taste!) and the only reference to &quot;Form&quot; is in the words &quot;platform&quot; and a single WinForms text file in .\web which tells you how to compile Managed.Windows.Forms from the sources - the file is dated 17th Sept 2004

My reference to the WinForm Wiki not being updated is an error (it was late last night when I was browsing!) From <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Gui_Toolkits#Windows.Forms">http://www.mono-project.com/Gui_Toolkits#Windows.Forms</A> goto <A HREF="http://svn.myrealbox.com/blog/">http://svn.myrealbox.com/blog/</A> - The box on the left &quot;Progress&quot; all refers to early 2005, Archives stop in Jan 2005 and clicking on Last Comments brings up a thread which starts in Jan 2005 though it has been bumped up by a null posting in Jan 2006.

<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/FAQ:_Winforms">http://www.mono-project.com/FAQ:_Winforms</A> says 

&quot;Do you have an estimate for when Windows.Forms will be released?

The plan currently is aimed at Q2/2005. &quot;

Putting it all together, I wrongly deduced that everything had come to a halt in Feb 2005 for some obscure political unstated reason and nothing was being updated. I am pleased to hear that I was wrong and it's just my problem of a steep learning curves in an unfamiliar environment and at an increasing age, plus of course the need for developers to develop rather than just to talk about it.

Thanks again Peter for putting me right; I will have another go at getting the right things installed.
