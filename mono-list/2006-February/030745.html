<PRE>Chris,

&gt;<i> Looking for some guidelines on consuming some of our library (in C) into
</I>&gt;<i> .NET for use with ASP.NET pages
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm concerned about our global and static variables that are needed in some
</I>&gt;<i> of our libraries.  In a single threaded C# application this would be no
</I>&gt;<i> problem.  Initialize the libraries at startup, destroy on close.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But for ASP.NET pages, how would I handle initialization, since multiple
</I>&gt;<i> pages are being served at the same time making use of these libraries?
</I>
Are your native libraries thread safe? If yes, you usually don't
have to care about the initialization. If they are not: welcome to a
world of pain.

&gt;<i> Would I initiailze for each page request as needed in the C# code behind
</I>&gt;<i> page?  Or is this going to have problems when multiple requests are issued?
</I>
It won't work. Go ahead and fix the native library. Everything
else is a waste of time.

 &gt; Also what about a function that contains a static variable?

You have to rewrite them to use a TLS slot instead of the
static variable. If the content of the static variable is
thread invariant, a lock for its initialization might be sufficient.

The same has to be done with static variables outside
of functions as well.

&gt;<i> Basically these are the questions I have, but I just can't find any
</I>&gt;<i> resources to explain how ASP.NET applications are threaded, and how it would
</I>&gt;<i> effect consumption of unmanaged libraries.  If anyone can even point me in
</I>&gt;<i> the right direction I'd be very grateful.
</I>
The threading model of ASP.NET is quite straightforward for
the developer: one cannot predict by which thread the request
will be handled. This implies that the ASP.NET consumer has
to deal with concurrency all the time.
