Hi all,

I have to agree with Atsushi on this one.  There are too many places to go
to get not enough information, but most of the people that can answer Mono
questions are only watching these lists.  The best thing we could do for
users would be to point them to nabble, or if NIH is a big deal to some of
our Mono ASP.NET fans, perhaps someone can soon provide a Mono-based
interface to the lists.

Chris, I'm the guy that did the port of ASP.NET Forums to Mono and
PostgreSQL, and I think there may have been a break down in communication
(and I'm sure the breakdown was on my side).  The first day I responded to
you, I gave you commit permissions on the Mono Forums project on
forge.novell.com. 
<A HREF="http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/project/?monoforums">http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/project/?monoforums</A>

I specifically did the port because I wanted to see gotmono replaced with
forums that would run on Mono.  This never came to fruition because I
never saw any real interest in this goal from the community, and I
eventually came to the same conclusion Atsushi pointed out.

I currently use mojoPortal (www.mojoportal.com) for www.mono-live.org, and
I'm very pleased with its forums support.

Sorry for any confusion, and good luck.  I would love to see the ASP.NET
Forums port see some real adoption somewhere (but probably not hosting yet
another Mono discussion board).

Joseph Hill
P.S. The latest Mono Live CD ships with the ASP.NET Forums running on
PostgreSQL 8.0.  You can find the scripts on the CD in
/var/xsp/AspNetForums/ddl-8.sql
