Jonel,
Thanks! Following your directions (even as stated before the above changes)
worked for me. The compile worked overnight. This morning I did the install
and my hello world compiled and ran. I'll do more checking later. (perhaps
run make check).

I think it is important for the wiki on the mono site to be corrected and to
have Jonel's tips stated rather than what is there. What is there is
misleading and insufficient (at least for Solaris 10 on Sparc)

In particular this URL is not helpful for Solaris 10 Sparc:
<A HREF="http://mono-project.com/Mono:SPARC">http://mono-project.com/Mono:SPARC</A>   (See the section labelled Building Mono
on Solaris)

It doesn't state anything about the &quot;bad&quot; -mt option specified in the
Solaris /usr/lib/pkgconfig/gthread-2.0.pc file which will keep anyone from
successfully building. It does state to not use any Sun tools, which appears
to be an unnecessary qualification and anyways doesn't specify any steps to
avoid using sun tools (for example /usr/ccs/bin/ld is used even though it is
not in your path. I needed to hide that bin directory to keep it from being
used). (Can I edit the wiki if I create an account?. I'd be willing to make
the changes)

Jonel, one other thing I'd add to your tips: It's unclear what (if anything)
is needed from /opt/csw. What libraries/binaries are you expecting to be
there? This is important so that others can go to blastwave and install the
correct packages. I'm thinking that nothing is really needed there. Other
than the fact that I specifically pointed CC at /opt/csw/gcc3/bin/gcc I
don't think anything else was found in there.

One last thing for the list. I know next to nothing about all of the
complications in the configure/make process. Is there a way to patch that so
that Jonel's tip are not needed? If so, is it worth filing this as a bug?
Perhaps it already has been. (I also know next to nothing about bugzilla or
whatever other tool is used on mono for bugs).

Thanks,
Michael
