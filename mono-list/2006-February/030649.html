<PRE>Hi,

The Mono win32 installer has been updated.  From the Release Notes:

 -Upgraded to GTK+ 2.8 and most Gnome 2.12 deps are included
 -Upgraded to gtk# 2.8
 -Upgraded Glade to 2.10 (Downloaded zip was labeled 2.12.1...?)
 -MonoDoc browser is included
  -gnome-sharp for gtk-sharp 1.0 have been added
  -Many Gnome Deps were required for this.  So, until we have
gecko-sharp
   working in the installer, this is the way it goes.  Including Gnome
deps
   add around 40MB uncompressed to the installed files. (6 MB
compressed)
 -Copied files in place of symbolic links for monodoc, gecko-sharp and
boo
 -Got the samples working with the current gtk-sharp (Bug #77292)
 -sqlsharpgtk now uses the Mono App Guidelines for its file locations
  -Had to recompile for some unknown reason...

Also some known issues:

-Uploading changes in Monodoc causes a crash.  Still looking into this.
-Generating the index in Monodoc causes an exception (chmod error)
 but the index eventually gets generated
-Icon View in GtkDemo crashes because of some missing themes (tried
adding
 themes, but the problem still occurs)

Right now, adding the gnome deps only gives added functionality of
gtkhtml-sharp1 and gnome-sharp1.  This makes it possible to run the
Monodoc doc browser.  This seemed easier than getting gecko-sharp to
work.  I'm open to ideas if anyone has any tips of including the Mozilla
stuff in the installer in order for gecko-sharp to work.

Here's the link to the previous 1.1.13.2 installer with gtk# 2.4.0 in
case it's needed:

Enjoy!
