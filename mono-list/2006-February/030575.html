<PRE>This may be a silly question.  Forgive me if it is.

 

If your concern is to get going with application development, why bother
with the source downloads?  I've used Red Carpet to download the
binaries since 1.0.something and have absolutely no problem keeping
everything up-to-date and working just fine.  Of course, if by
development you mean developing Mono itself, then I understand.

 

For the record, I do all my development in Visual Studio and just copy
the necessary files for installing on both Windows and Linux.

 

Deployment is a bit more complicated for remoting - but not very.

 

Cheers

 

 

Peter

Peter 

Thanks for the quick reply (and apologies to anyone who has had multiple
copies of the original by email as I edited minor details in my initial
posting). 

I started at the download page &quot;download/fedora-4-i386/&quot; you mention,
but took the easy option of &quot;put the mono.repo file in ...&quot; and used yum
to install. That could explain why I did not get everything the repo
file refers only to  mono-1.1, gtk-sharp 1.0 and 2.0 and mono-tools +
mono-deps. 

The sources (mono-1.1.13.2-source.tar.gz) were downloaded this morning
from the URL you mention - the file is 18,043,178 bytes. I don't
understand why we have a difference; I used WinZip to unzip / untar it
to a Windows folder on XP (sorry about the lack of taste!) and the only
reference to &quot;Form&quot; is in the words &quot;platform&quot; and a single WinForms
text file in .\web which tells you how to compile Managed.Windows.Forms
from the sources - the file is dated 17th Sept 2004 

My reference to the WinForm Wiki not being updated is an error (it was
late last night when I was browsing!) From
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Gui_Toolkits#Windows.Forms">http://www.mono-project.com/Gui_Toolkits#Windows.Forms</A> goto
<A HREF="http://svn.myrealbox.com/blog/">http://svn.myrealbox.com/blog/</A> - The box on the left &quot;Progress&quot; all
refers to early 2005, Archives stop in Jan 2005 and clicking on Last
Comments brings up a thread which starts in Jan 2005 though it has been
bumped up by a null posting in Jan 2006. 

<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/FAQ:_Winforms">http://www.mono-project.com/FAQ:_Winforms</A> says 

&quot;Do you have an estimate for when Windows.Forms will be released? 

The plan currently is aimed at Q2/2005. &quot; 

Putting it all together, I wrongly deduced that everything had come to a
halt in Feb 2005 for some obscure political unstated reason and nothing
was being updated. I am pleased to hear that I was wrong and it's just
my problem of a steep learning curves in an unfamiliar environment and
at an increasing age, plus of course the need for developers to develop
rather than just to talk about it. 

Thanks again Peter for putting me right; I will have another go at
getting the right things installed.

Jim, 

I'm sorry to hear you're having such a bad start trying out winforms. 

It would be useful if you told us what exactly you downloaded, and where

from. 

You refer to looking for SWF support in the Mono core, if you check this

list: <A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/download/fedora-4-i386/">http://www.go-mono.com/download/fedora-4-i386/</A> you'll see that 
mono-winforms is a separate package from mono-core. 

Just for giggles, I downloaded the sources for 1.1.13.2 from here: 
<A HREF="http://go-mono.com/sources/">http://go-mono.com/sources/</A> and checked, and the tarball does indeed
contain 
a mono-1.1.13.2/mcs/class/Managed.Windows.Forms path and all it's files
and 
subdirs. 

Not sure where you're getting your dates from or where or what the
WinForm 
wiki is, could you provide the URLs? 

Cheers, 
  Peter
