<PRE>I have just double checked my dev setup, PATH should have /opt/csw/bin in
the very beginning. I will update my blog as well.  I use:

./configure --with-libs=/opt/csw/lib --with-includes=/opt/csw/include ...

in my configure line. I used to have problems with /usr/ccs/bin/ld and did
what you were doing, but you don't have to anymore. Mono will build
properly.

	Hi,
	 
	I have some pointers here:

in building in sparc, not alot but not trivial either


OK, I'm giving it a try right now. However I just saw during the config that
it picked ld from /usr/ccs/bin/ld not the gnu version. Is this going to be a
problem down the road? As I said in a previous message I avoided this
problem by &quot;hiding&quot; /usr/ccs/bin., but this time I configured everything
just as you stated. 

The other concern I had is that several posts to this mailing list have
stated that you should be sure to use only gnu utilities. With the path set
up the way you have it, many sun utilities will be used (ar, ld, sed,
etc...). I see you didn't take any steps to correct for that. Did you not
need to?

Since the blastwave utilities are all prefixed with &quot;g&quot; it doesn't look like
any of them would be used and you would not need any of them installed for
this process. Is that correct?
