<PRE>Edward,

Thanks for the encouragement.

&quot;Great minds...&quot;  You also outlined one possible backup strategy we had
looked at as well.  A lot of our client side functionality sits in .NET
libraries.  We're going to verify those .NET libraries are still
functional but using a GTK# or MonoMac front end.

However, the low hanging fruit of using a pre-existing app was too great
to not explore.

FWIW, I've managed to the app functional using plain XQuarz, and GTK
along with libgdiplus from Mac Ports.  There are some menu sizing issues
along with some other context menu problems, but it looks promising.
Some of the issues (like context menu problems) are also encountered on
a Linux test machine as well.

Jeff

</I>&gt;<i> I can't comment on your other comments, but I wish you the best of luck.  I am not taking the route of trying to make mac GUI from windows forms, because it doesn't work very well.  I see there is the mono-osx project, but I haven't explored it and I don't know how useful it is.  Somebody told me some stuff that makes me believe it gives you some tools to more easily create a native mac GUI that interacts with mono.  But I may have misunderstaood, and for all I know, it might be unstable or unsupported - I don't know.  We have opted to write the backend in C#/.Net/Mono, write the GUI frontend (obviously) in .Net for windows, and write the GUI for mac using native XBuild / cocoa / objective C.  But it's just the GUI frontend.  So far, this is working well for us, and once again, I wish you the best of luck.  You might already be doing exactly what you should be doing ... But I don't know...
