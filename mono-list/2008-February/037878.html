Thanks for all the replies.  I am going to get persistent sessions set up
using MySql (great idea) and I will analyse what MySql is up to.  I don't
think MySql is the problem, as it is Apache / mod-Mono that gets restarted. 
mod-mono will use around 70Mb and doesn't go above this, no matter what I
throw at it.

The problem only seems to happen on a Friday.  Users in the morning go from
70 up to about a hundred - same at lunchtime.  The strangest thing about all
of this is that the morning use on a Friday will go fine - just as planned,
and then at lunchtime, even the *first* user isn't recorded.

I can't recreate the problem from here, even if I recreate the use of 120
users.  I know that this is the wrong forum, but could it be the fact that
all the school connects through a multi-school proxy server?  Perhaps 100
requests for the same page and it decides to block the site?  I have never
worked with proxy servers so it is just a guess.  It doesn't explain why the
page still displays but database actions aren't actioned.  Its quite a head
scratcher.
