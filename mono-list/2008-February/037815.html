Yes, GC == Garbage Collector or Garbage Collection.

You can explicitly request a GC by calling System.GC.Collect(), but the
GC can ignore your request.  Generally, it's not a good idea to
explicitly force a GC, unless you know what you're doing.

&gt;<i> btw , what do you mean for implicit boxing ? is it a sort of unwanted

</I>
Value types are stored on the stack or &quot;inline&quot; within the object.  If
you need a value type to be placed on the GC heap, it needs to be boxed.

Examples of boxing:

	object o = 42;
	Console.WriteLine (42);
	ArrayList a = new ArrayList (); a.Add (42);

Notice that there is no visible indication that boxing is occurring.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - if the GC could be forced to start at secure-time-known idle times
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - if the application has been tested and kept as simple as possible not

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would you still not trust such a RT application ?
</I>
I would trust it more than the un-GC'd equivalent.  The reason?  Heap
fragmentation.  Without a GC, the heap can become fragmented, eventually
reaching the point that (1) you have enough memory to fulfill a request,
but (2) the memory you have available isn't contiguous, so the request
cannot be fulfilled.

Mono won't currently help here (as it doesn't currently use a moving
collector), but the use of a GC (eventually) permits a moving collector,
which can prevent the heap from becoming fragmented.

In short, the GC isn't necessarily a problem; it's just a different set
of trade-offs compared to manually managing memory (memory leaks vs. GC
overhead, heap fragmentation vs. GC overhead, etc.).

&gt;<i> What also could go wrong ?
</I>
Don't tempt fate. :-)
