Well, to get all of Mono, I would say that you should install the latest
version of each of those RPMs.

The key decision of course is if you are running on i386 (32 bit) or x86_64
(64 bit). Use the appropriate directory to get the RPMs that you need.

If all you need is to run a Windows Forms app, you might be able to get away
with just mono-addon-core, mono-addon-winforms, and mono-addon-libgdiplus.

Personally, I always build from source on my RHEL systems.

<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Compiling_Mono_From_Git">http://www.mono-project.com/Compiling_Mono_From_Git</A>

To get the latest stable release of Mono just change 'git checkout mono-2-6'
to 'git checkout mono-2-10' instead.

One of the biggest advantages of building from source is that you can get
the latest bug fixes without having to wait for a new release. Just do the
following at any time from the 'mono' source directory as 'root':

Type 'git pull' at the command line to pull down any changes to the code
since your last build

Type './autogen.sh -prefix=/usr/local &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install' to install
your updates.

Change '/usr/local' to wherever you want to install Mono. This is the path
they suggest in the instructions.

If you have done 'git checkout mono-2-10' earlier in the process (even
during a previous session) then you will only pull down bug fixes and
updates to Mono 2.10. If not, you are following the development trunk (the
unreleased next version of Mono-currently 2.11) and may see changes in
functionality or other breakages.

The first time you build Mono it might be a bit of a hassle to install all
the dependencies. After that though you can rebuild it with the two simply
command-lines above.

When you install from source, you get pretty much everything from the single
git repo (inlcuding Windows Forms) so there is a lot less to worry about.
Notable exceptions are 'xsp' and 'mod_mono' which are required to serve
ASP.NET applications and GTK# which you might want to create (or run) GTK+
GUI apps. These are also available from GitHub though.

The biggest pain is compiling 'libgdiplus' as it requires a bunch of
dependencies that you may not have installed. It is simple enough to use
'yum' to grab them though and you only need to install the dependencies only
once. 'libgdiplus' is an implementation of the Windows GDI+ graphics layer
and requires the development libraries for a bunch of image manipulation
stuff (JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, EXIF, etc). I do not remember anymore
everything that was required. It will tell you though if something is
missing.

Mono itself does not require much. I think that 'bison', 'gettext', and
'gcc' are the three big things you will need for that. GCC is of course the
compiler. Hard to build much without that.
