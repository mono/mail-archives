<PRE>Hey guys,

    I just posted this on my blog:

        We are getting flooded with paid support requests for
        Mono.   Developers looking for us to fix bugs in Mono, to do
        some custom work, to port applications, libraries and adjust
        Mono for some specific needs.

        But we are trying to be a product company as opposed to a
        support company.

        We still want to help the Mono user community, and with all
        of the Mono talent out there, at least we can use this
        opportunity to get both groups in touch: the users that want
        custom engineering done, with the talented list of hackers.

        If you are a consultant available to do custom engineering
        and support for customers, we would love to put you in touch
        with people that need the custom engineering done.    Email us
        at <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-list">contact at xamarin.com</A>, in the subject line, specify that you
        are available for custom engineering, and in the body of the
        message list both your Mono skills (C# or C coding) and your
        availability to engage on those gigs.

        We will then get you in touch with users that needs the
        work done.
