<PRE>I'm using the debian packages of the January 14th mono snapshot. Using 
XSP directly because current libapache-mod-mono is not yet packaged.

There appears to be a problem with resolution of &quot;application relative&quot; 
URLS - ie, urls that start with &quot;~/&quot;. In XSP, the &quot;~/&quot; seems to be 
ignored entirely, and &quot;~/Foo/Bar.ascx&quot; is interpreted exactly as if it 
were &quot;Foo/Bar.ascx&quot;.

The specific case that I'm encountering is when the URL is used as the 
Src attribute of a @Register directive - I can't confirm or deny whether 
the problem occurs for other uses of &quot;~/&quot;, but it seems highly possible 
that it would.

Around 0.28 I was able to get libapache-mod-mono working and did not 
have this problem, so it's either a regression or specific to standalone 
XSP.

Even with that old libapache-mod-mono I had some problems with these 
URLs: sometimes the ~ would get passed through to the browser rather 
than being interpreted server-side. I intended to upgrade to a more 
recent version to test whether this problem was fixed before doing 
specific testing of when it happened, but I think it was either in the 
NavigateUrl attribute of asp:HyperLink or in the argument to 
Response.Redirect().

If I remember rightly, IBuySpy portal makes heavy use of these kind of 
URLs, and I'd be surprised if it works out of the box with this bug.

Anyone know if this area of code has been changed since January 14th? 
Could this be fixed in 0.30?

Thanks,
Stuart.
