I don't think that they're documented anywhere.

I do know that building mono can take hundreds of megabytes, but that
has more to do with having lots of source code than anything else.

I would suggest trying it, if he's running Red Hat 9 and can install the
RPMs.  It would be interesting to know how well it runs there.
