<PRE>OK, following up my own post and thoughts.

I went ahead and installed OS X 10.3 on an external FW drive, and just 
built a ground up Mono install using pkg-config 0.15.0, glib-2.3.1, 
gettext 0.11.5, and mono-0.30.1.  And I'm getting ready to assemble the 
.pkg files for those installations.  The question now becomes, where to 
put them...

On a fresh installation of OS X, /usr/local/bin is not in the path.  
Everything lives in /usr/bin, including java, javac, php, ruby, and 
python.  Based upon that, we have the option of installing Mono and 
it's dep's into /usr/ /usr/local/ or /opt/.

For the average user, installing it to /usr/ means that it will just 
magically work.  The other alternative is to write a shell script to 
alter the systemwide environment variables, but this would be 
overwritten by every .x.x patch to the OS.  With the change to bash, we 
could alter it for the terminal windows, but spawned tasks would not 
have the correct environment by default.

Looking at the way that Apple integrated Java into the operating 
system, it looks like the &quot;proper&quot; way to do this would be to go to 
/usr/ as this would allow Mono development to build applications that 
are deployed in &lt;&lt;name&gt;&gt;.app bundles just like Java applications and be 
executable in the same fashion, giving Mono apps the same level of 
system parity as Java.

The only negative I see with this is that it might conflict with other 
versions of glib-2 or gettext on the system.  It might give some 
strange interactions with DarwinPorts or Fink applications.

Does anyone have any thoughts?
