<PRE>&gt;<i> Pango implements what I think it is the functionality of System.Drawing, no?
</I>
it implements just the text drawing.

&gt;<i> Now, I'am confused what library I should use to &quot;draw&quot;...
</I>
What do you want to do? Scalar vector graphics: rsvg-sharp, trivial gui
for existing windows programs: S.W.F., new trivial guis: gtk# + glade#,
new guis: gtk#, Imaging and some low-level graphics: Gdk, existing
windows programs with low-level graphics: You should wait until
System.Drawing comes up to the light (and it may not work if using
P/Invokes, which is fair easy)... But again: What do you want to do? The
decision may impact you in time, resources, deployment, complexity...
