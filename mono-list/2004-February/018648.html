<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> I'm a C#/C++ programmer who joined the Linux scene a few months ago.
</I>&gt;<i> I always need to use System.Drawing, and have to keep going over to my 
</I>&gt;<i> windows box to do so. It's a bit annoying, having to use windows for that 
</I>&gt;<i> one thing. I recently saw in some article or other that you can use it on 
</I>&gt;<i> Mono, so I googled for a bit looking for information.
</I>&gt;<i> I have gathered that I need GDI+, but am at loss for where to get it. Once I 
</I>&gt;<i> have got it, I have no idea how to configure it so I can get it to work.. I 
</I>&gt;<i> could really use some help on this matter, both on how to configure and 
</I>&gt;<i> install it, and how to compile source code using System.Drawing.
</I>
It is not ready for production use.  You will be just too frustrated
with it right now.   But libgdiplus is available from the download
section on the Mono site.

&gt;<i> Am I right in thinking that you can use windows.forms now, but through WINE? 
</I>&gt;<i> If so, will you need to use it through wine in the future, or will it be 
</I>&gt;<i> available built in to mono once it has been implemented?
</I>
That is another part that we have not released;  When we have it
completed in the next few weeks, instructions will be available.

</PRE>
