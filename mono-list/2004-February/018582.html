<PRE>Hello,

I'm using monodoc to build some docs for a project and had a few
questions. First monodoc has been integrated into our build system,
integration was easy and the docs look great. Once the docs are built
(make doc) they're exported to the sources directory where they can be
viewed with the browser. I want to be able to sync any docs generated
from future code changes, and documentation written through the browser.
Do I have to do anything special here to prevent anything from being
lost? 

Second, I'm getting errors in the browser when viewing my name spaces.
The classes view with the &quot;Type&quot; and &quot;Summary&quot; headings show up fine
with the Type field populated with my class names and the Summary field
containing the &quot;to be added&quot; tag and &quot;An error occured while loading
type information: File &quot;My.Namespace&quot; not found. I'm not really sure
where to start tracking this one down. Any help would be great.

Thanks,
- Phil

ps Monodoc is one of the most useful tools yet, it's getting me out of
writing A LOT of documentation for my senior design project. Less
writing is good.
