Well, I guess that there could be a way to detect and repair the
corrupted .wapi directory. Instead of raising the &quot;Shared memory sanity
check failed.&quot; message in ${MONO_SOURCE_DIR}/mono/io-handles/shared.c
you should remove the ~/.wapi directory and rerun the shm_file_attach
function. But I would leave that to Mono developers because I don't know
what consequences could that have, so it would be better if they could
think that over and &quot;repare&quot; the mono/io-handles/shared.c file.
I don't know what is the way to corrupt the ~/.wapi directory. In my
case, it was the system crash, and since the mono application was
running, that file was open and obviously it was not saved the right way
:<i>) If that is the only way, you could edit init scripts and remove that
</I>(or those) directories at boot time. If there are other ways to corrupt
the ~/.wapi, then only editing mono/io-handles/shared.c is the right
way.

&lt;PRE&gt;The shared handles storage in ~/.wapi seems to be still a bit unstable. 
Is there any way to detect and repair a corrupted .wapi directory 
instead of raising the &amp;quot;Shared memory sanity check failed.&amp;quot; message?

We're deleting it in the start script of our application, but that
works only because that's the only Mono app running in this user
context.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/PRE&gt;
