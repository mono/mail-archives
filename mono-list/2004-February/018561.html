<PRE>&gt;<i> I haven't had the please of attending a Brainshare yet, even though I
</I>&gt;<i> have been a Novell fan/sys admin for years.  I can't justify the out of
</I>&gt;<i> pocket expense, and have yet to work for anyone that would pay for that
</I>&gt;<i> type of thing.  Are there any free sessions / meetings that would make
</I>&gt;<i> the 450 mile trip worth while?
</I>
There is some meeting with the Linux user's group, but I forget the
dates and the venue.
