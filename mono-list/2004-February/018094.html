<PRE>I asked these on the IRC channel, but I thought I'd ask here too in case
anyone wasn't on IRC and might be able to help me. I'm trying to decide
whether to do a friend's site in PHP or ASP.NET. I'd like to do it in
ASP.NET for the experience, but I'm not sure if I can do the following
things under Mono.

#1 - Upload and resize images. Very simple functionality needed here.
Upload the image, resize it, save it to the server.

#2 - Work with some kind of WYSIWYG web-based editor to allow them to
paste in a Newsletter and upload that as HTML. I know there are ActiveX
controls out there, but I'm not sure what's out there that works with
ASP.NET well.

Anyway, I'm loathe to have to dual-boot to do this project, but it may
be worth it to learn ASP.NET better. Can anyone give me an idea if what
I'm looking to do is impossible under Mono as it currently stands?

Preston
