<PRE>If you actually look at /usr/bin/javac, /usr/bin/java, those are soft links
to /System/Library/Framework/JavaVM.Framework/Version/1.4.2/Command/java.

--&gt; We only have to create soft links for stuff main executables, but not
necessary the .exe assemblies since those are just .Net assemblies unless we
have some .exe Mono launcher in /etc/... as discussed many times on this
list.

As for the version: that is the framework version not the assembly version.
The GAC is fine and no problem, but Apple is talking about the executables
(mono,mint) dynamic libraries (libmono.dylib, ...) and the C-headers, and
that has a standard folder structure.

Hello,

&gt;<i> Well actually I agree that the shell scripts 'mono' and 'mcs' might 
</I>&gt;<i> live in /usr/bin, but I would create a Framework and put it in 
</I>&gt;<i> /System/Library/Frameworks/MonoVM.Framework the same way as 
</I>&gt;<i> /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.Framework is placed (look at the 
</I>&gt;<i> folder structure within the framework to see how Apple is structuring 
</I>&gt;<i> such a beast).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But the .Net assemblies should live in 
</I>&gt;<i> /System/Library/Frameworks/MonoVM.Framework/Versions/0.30/Assemblies 
</I>&gt;<i> where there is a link pointing there @ 
</I>&gt;<i> /System/Library/Frameworks/MonoVM.Framework/Assemblies.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That would conform with Apple's standard much better: I don't know how 
</I>&gt;<i> we would have to build mono to include those in the assembly load 
</I>&gt;<i> path...
</I>
I think you just build mono with a prefix of:

	/System/Library/Frameworks/MonoVM.Framework

And just copy anything that is installed in the bin/ subdirectory to
/usr/bin.

As for the versioning: we will be taking care of library versions in a
different way (the GAC approach)
