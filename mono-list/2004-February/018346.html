<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> What's the build procedure to create a windows installer from CVS?  (Who is
</I>&gt;<i> normally creating those builds?)  Is there a continues build process in
</I>&gt;<i> place to ensure that platforms are not broken (cygwin is not building @ the
</I>&gt;<i> time, error in libtest.c, and Mono.Data.PostgreSqlClient).  I have been
</I>&gt;<i> asking for this for about a year now, and it seems like nobody is using mono
</I>&gt;<i> on cygwin.  I know that cygwin is not a priority for most users, but it
</I>&gt;<i> seems like an simple organizational issue to me [correct me if I'm wrong].
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm willing to help, if nessecary.
</I>
Part of the problem with Cygwin is that there is no common version of
Cygwin.  It is more like a continuous flood of updates: so if you catch
Cygwin at the right point, you will have the right tools with the right
versions.  

Sometimes you will be unlucky enough to get a different set of versions,
and you wont be able to build.

The installer bits for Mono have been historically on CVS, but we have
not built these ones recently.  Dan Morgan (a long time Mono developer)
has taken over doing this.
