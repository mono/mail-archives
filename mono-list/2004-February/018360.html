If you want to generate static html someone has to write a script that
either uses monodoc --html &lt;link&gt; for every possible link in monodoc or
write a script that uses the xsl files to convert the monodoc xml files
to html.

Keep in mind both approaches would require converting all links from
monodoc's internal method to something that will work in a browser.

I think a far better thing would be to write a small SWF app that uses
monodoc.dll to browse the docs.  I once was testing the C# SWT
implementation and did this in a few hours. There are two examples of
how to get the data already (Gtk# and asp.net versions) which should
allow that person to do it rather easily.

I have no interest in doing either of these things myself, so hopefully
someone in the win32 crowd will do it if they need it.
