<PRE>Hi all,

A 0.6 rc1 release of Npgsql is finally out!!

Sorry for the long delay between this release and the previous. I hope 
this doesn't occur anymore.

Release notes:

Initial support for connection pooling. You can use the connection 
pooling by specifying the MinPoolSize=value in the connection string. 
The MaxPoolSize can also be specified, but it is not implemented yet.

Note that some logs about connection not being closed will be shown as a 
side effect of connection pool. The unmanaged socket is closed, but 
server complains and logs about the sundden close. Please, check this 
post 
(<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-devel-list/2003-December/003380.html">http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-devel-list/2003-December/003380.html</A>) 
for more details about it.

Faster support of bytea binary data. Thanks Jackson Harper (jackson at 
ximian dot com) and Jonathan Gilbert (2a5gjx302 at sneakemail dot 
com).The performance for adding binary data is 10x faster than original 
code :)

CommandBuilder and better Dataset support. Thanks Pedro Yoros (yoros at 
wanadoo dot es).

bearm (bearm at mail dot it) and Marcus Better (marcus at dactylis dot 
com) also helped with bug fixes in this release.

Added support for Unicode encoding. Fixes feature
request 534 on gborg. Thanks Ivar &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ivar@lumisoft.ee">ivar@lumisoft.ee</A>&gt; for pointing it out.

Added code to set datestyle to iso when connecting using protocol 3.0 
version. Thanks Sami Kuhmonen &lt;<A HREF="mailto:feenix@iqs.fi">feenix@iqs.fi</A>&gt; for pointing it out.

Removed a log line which reduced the connection startup time in 300 
milliseconds.


Morten Mertner (morten at mertner dot com) said Npgsql was taking too 
much to establish the first connection. I could notice that this seems 
to be happening only on windows. I'm investigating that and I hope have 
it fixed in the final 0.6.


Both cvs repositories: gborg and mono as well are updated and synched 
with the latest code.

Please, get it and test it and please fill any bugs you find.

You can use both bug report system:

gborg: <A HREF="http://gborg.postgresql.org/project/npgsql/bugs/buglist.php">http://gborg.postgresql.org/project/npgsql/bugs/buglist.php</A>
mono: <A HREF="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/">http://bugzilla.ximian.com/</A>


You can get the release at:
<A HREF="http://gborg.postgresql.org/project/npgsql/download/download.php?branch=devel">http://gborg.postgresql.org/project/npgsql/download/download.php?branch=devel</A>

Also, a daily build of Npgsql can be obtained from the mono daily builds:

Thanks very much for all feedback received.
