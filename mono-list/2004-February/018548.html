Wouldn't it be nice if the default location of .wapi was 
/tmp/.wapi-username? I'm pretty sure that the &quot;this could be deleted at 
any time&quot; semantics of /tmp don't apply to files that are in use at the 
time, or it would be impossible to *ever* use /tmp safely.

Using /tmp as the default location and auto-deleting if the sanity check 
fails would fix two very frequently reported problems with Mono and XSP.

Is there ever any reason why you would even want .wapi to persist when 
*no* mono processes are running?

Is it even needed at all most of the time? What are the .NET semantics 
that it exists to enable? Could it be created on-demand when one of 
those features is used, instead of every time mono is run? Or just have 
all mono processes completely independent (no .wapi directory at all) by 
default unless you explicitly specify a parameter to turn on the sharing?

Stuart.
