<PRE>I haven't had the please of attending a Brainshare yet, even though I
have been a Novell fan/sys admin for years.  I can't justify the out of
pocket expense, and have yet to work for anyone that would pay for that
type of thing.  Are there any free sessions / meetings that would make
the 450 mile trip worth while?


Thanks!
-Nick
