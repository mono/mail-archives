<PRE>Seems interesting, at the very least, I like that objects can obtain
their type from the assignment itself, as well as being able to map
using statements to the class level, there are times where a class
within a class has been the easiest approach for me to do some things,
and this would definately be helpfull for that.

Nice work, will enjoy playing with it..
