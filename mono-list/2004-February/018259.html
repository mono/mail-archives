Which begs the question, why is it even allowed to have a &quot;web.config&quot; 
file?  Couldn't the whole problem be resolved if it was agreed that the 
only accepted naming for the config file is &quot;Web.config&quot;, as it is on 
Windows in the first place?

I am fine with Paolo's suggestion as well, it just seems to be a little 
odd to allow for potentially confusing naming of configuration files, 
or even to print a warning.

Seems like a sane (and simple) solution.
