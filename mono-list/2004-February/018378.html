I think you're plain wrong calling C# bare metal performance when you've
used that exact
phrase to describe C++'s performance.
I'm not Java against .NET here, but:
Like it or not, the JVM's performance is superior to that of the .NET
VM, and it sometimes 
outperforms even C++ native code. This is not FUD, it's not
lets-do-it-this-way-cos-it-will-prove-me-right  benchmarking, it's due
to the differences in
the way some code you wrote runs: compiled once to native code versus
compiled
to byte-code and then re-compiled and profiled and adjusted multiple
times during run-time.
This performance improvement has often been noticed when doing stuff
like regexp or xml.
I don't really see any reason the .NET VM would not achieve this state
of the art, but it's just
not there yet. Naturally there's loads of other areas where .NET is
faster than Java, take for one
GUI applications. But that's a corner-case (no, don't start cursing,
it's probably more important than
regexp or recursive methods) compared to the raw ability of dynamically
re-writing and optimising
pieces of code. And hey, let's not forget Java/IBM's SWT :-)

Cheers,

Hey team,

Long-time listener, first-time caller. I wanted to get your advice on

interested in creating an OSS app that makes it easier to sell stuff on
eBay. (Giving developers this kind of help is actually part of my job at

custom eBay clients that use the API because eBay changes so frequently, and
I've had to agonize with developers that have made sub-optimal language and
