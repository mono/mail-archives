You can turn any widget in Gtk# into doing double buffering for you very
easily:

	Widget d = new DrawingArea ();
	d.DoubleBuffered = true;

If you want more control over this, you can create a Gdk.Pixmap where
you perform all of your drawing operations, keep in mind the following
hierarchy:

	Gdk.Drawable
	    + Gdk.Window
	    + Gdk.Pixmap

So you can create your Pixmap, do all your drawing there, and when you
want to transfer this into the screen, you do a DrawDrawable on the
window. 

Like this:

        void ExposeHandler (object obj, ExposeEventArgs args)
        {
                Gdk.Window win = args.Event.window;
		Pixmap buffer = new Pixmap (win, 100, 100, -1);

		buffer.DrawXXX ();

		// Once you are done, copy the pixmap to the window.
		win.DrawDrawable (Style.WhiteGC, buffer, 0, 0, 0, 0, 100, 100);
	}

But as I said, you get that for free with Gtk+ 

More details are on Monodoc.	

Miguel.
