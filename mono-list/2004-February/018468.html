<PRE>I am attempting to successfully compile both mono and mcs (and =
eventually gtk-sharp 0.16) on windows (XP SP1) with cygwin and I have =
had some success with a successful build of mono 0.30.1 by slightly =
modifying these instructions I found on the mono-devel list:

The snag I am having is when I try to compile the mcs 0.30.1 source.  =
When I run make I get the following error:

I am currently just trying to get a downloadable release version of mcs =
compiled and I was wondering if anyone has seen this issue and how they =
went about solving it.  What is &quot;_mkstemp&quot; and how do I set the =
reference for it?
=20
I also would suggest putting some sort of updated instructions on how to =
get all of these great tools compiled on windows on the mono site.  It =
would be very helpful for everyone trying to work with them on windows.  =
I will be more than happy to send on the instructions I have once I get =
them working fully.

Thanks,
