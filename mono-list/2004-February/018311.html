Reading the jit documents in mono/mini should help: mini-doc.txt
and mini-porting.txt.

</I>&gt;<i> 2) I've modified the disassembler to see the previously unused opcode as my new one.

You added the opcode to mono/cil/opcode.def, right? That is the place
where the opcode name, type and its arguments are defined.

&gt;<i> 3) I've attempted, and failed, to get mono to recognize this previously
</I>&gt;<i> unused opcode and output the appropriate machine specific code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So basically I need to modify mono to map an MSIL opcode to machine

</I>
It's quite simple.

&gt;<i> Some files I *think* are involved with what I need to do are:
</I>&gt;<i> - mono/mini/inssel.brg
</I>&gt;<i> - mono/mini/mini.c
</I>&gt;<i> - mono/mini/mini-x86.c
</I>&gt;<i> - mono/arch/x86/x86-codegen.h
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any information about how mono recognizes MSIL opcodes and translates
</I>&gt;<i> them into machine specific code or where I could find info about this
</I>&gt;<i> would be much appreciated.

Read the jit documents above for some background information.
mini.c is the file that read the IL code stream and decides how any
single IL instruction is implemented (mono_method_to_ir () func), so you
always have to add an entry to the big switch inside the function: if
you take a look at the file you'll find plenty of examples.
You didn't tell us what kind of instruction you added, so I'll give the
generic description.
An IL opcode can be implemented in a number of ways, depending on what
it does, how it needs to do it etc.

Some opcodes are implemented using a helper function: one of the simpler
examples is the CEE_STELEM_REF implementation. In this case the opcode
implementation is written in a C function. You'll need to register the
function with the jit before use (mono_register_jit_call) and you'll
emit the call to the helper using the mono_emit_jit_icall() function.
This is the simpler way to add a new opcode and it doesn't require any
arch-specific change (though it's limited to what you can do in C code
and the performance may be limited by the function call).

Other opcodes can be implemented with one or more of the already
implemented low-level instructions. An examples is the OP_STRLEN opcode
which implements String.Length using a simple load from memory.
In this case you need to add a rule to the appropriate burg file,
describing what are the arguments of the opcode and what is, if any,
it's 'return' value. The OP_STRLEN case is:

reg: OP_STRLEN (reg) {  
	MONO_EMIT_LOAD_MEMBASE_OP (s, tree, OP_LOADI4_MEMBASE, state-&gt;reg1, 
		state-&gt;left-&gt;reg1, G_STRUCT_OFFSET (MonoString, length));
}

The opcode returns a value in an integer register (state-&gt;reg1) by
performing a int32 load of the length field of the MonoString
represented by the input register (state-&gt;left-&gt;reg1): before the burg
rules are applied, the internal representation is based on trees, so you
get the left/right pointers.
This instruction implementation doesn't require arch-specific changes,
usually and the produced code is fast.

Next we have opcodes that must be implemented with new low-level
architecture specific instructions (either because of performance
considerations or because the functionality can't get implemented in
other ways). You need a burg rule in this case, too. For example,
consider the OP_CHECK_THIS opcode (used to raise an exception if the
this pointer is null). The burg rule simply reads:

stmt: OP_CHECK_THIS (reg) {
	mono_bblock_add_inst (s-&gt;cbb, tree);
}

Note this opcode doesn't return a value and takes a register as input.
mono_bblock_add_inst (s-&gt;cbb, tree) just adds the instruction (the tree
variable) to the current basic block (s-&gt;cbb). In mini this is the place
where the internal representation switches from the tree format to the
low-level format (list of simple instructions). In this case the actual
opcode implementation is delegated to the arch-specific code.
A low-level opcode needs an entry in the machine description (the *.md
files in mini/). This entry describes what kkind of registers are used
if any by the instruction, as well as other details such as constraints
or other hints to the low-level engine which are arch-specific.
cpu-pentium.md, for example has the following entry:

checkthis: src1:b len:3

This means the instruction uses an integer register as a base pointer
(basically a load or store is done on it) and it takes 3 bytes of native
code to implement it.
Now you just need to provide the low-level implementation for the opcode
in one of the mini-$arch.c files, in the mono_arch_output_basic_block()
function. There is a big switch here too. The x86 implementation is:
		case OP_CHECK_THIS:
			/* ensure ins-&gt;sreg1 is not NULL */
			x86_alu_membase_imm (code, X86_CMP, ins-&gt;sreg1, 0, 0);
			break;

If the $arch-codegen.h header file doesn't have the code to emit the
low-level native code, you'll need to write that as well.
Complex opcodes with register constraints may require other changes to
the local register allocator, but usually it's not needed.

Hope this helps.
