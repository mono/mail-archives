Seems to me that without including the base support code, the saved regular
expressions wouldn't work on any runtime other than mono. I seem to recall
reading that compiled regexes can be saved to an assembly by some
roundabout procedure, after which it can be sent and loaded elsewhere. If
the saved form relies on a base class implementation internal to mono's
corlib, then it is effectively glued to mono. I believe what is desired
here is some kind of &quot;template&quot; that can be built upon during the compile
process, so that they don't have to inline miles of static
System.Reflection.Emit code. It should be possible to still derive from a
base class but include the base class -- unmodified -- in the resulting
assembly, no?
