<PRE>I'm trying to get the company I work for to consider using ASP.NET
because of the benefits it has.  As a `Mono kinda guy` I'd love to use
mod_mono and stick with Linux.  As such I've got a bunch of questions
regarding mod_mono (assume xsp by default).

For the following, assume we can work through bugs as they come.  And
know that we currently run 3 web servers with PHP/Apache - so we'd be
comparing scalability to that.

Will mod_mono integrate with Apache as well as PHP does?  If not, does
it plan on performing such a task?

Has mod_mono been tested under LARGE loads?  If so, how did it handle?

Assuming that none of the above work as we need them to.  What kind of
development would be required to get mod_mono/xsp/Apache up to par with
IIS/ASP.NET?

These are very general, so if there's anything else that anyone could
think of that I might need to know, please feel free.

Thanks in advance,

~ Matthew
