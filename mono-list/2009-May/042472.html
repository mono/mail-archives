(Sorry for the late reply here, was out of town and my machine was
acting weird due to a strange kernel bug, heh.)

The way that Debian packaged Mono, they split it into 100+ different
packages.  I had a need for Mono 2.4, but I found it nearly impossible
to update the current packaging infrastructure because of the way that
they did the massive splits, so I packaged with as close to a 1:1
mapping to upstream sources as possible.  The packaging is probably not
perfect for _all_ needs yet, but if there are issues I would be happy
to hear about them so they can be worked out.  For now, the packaging
is done for a project of mine that depends on Mono 2.4.

I'm considering actually just deploying the application with a version
of the Mono runtime such that it can all be deployed as a single
tarball, though that is something I have to consider depending on
whether they'll actually ship Mono 2.4 in a non-broken fashion.  So
far, using Mono under Ubuntu has been a royal pain because of the way
they try to split everything up (and omit some things).

When it comes to packaging, I think it would be nice if there were some
way that all of the major distributions could agree on a standard for a
package format and package naming, and permit upstream developers to
provide packages much like they do for Windows and OS X systems; that'd
make things far easier with regard to working with software and users
being able to determine their own requirements and keep their own
things up-to-date, and narrow the focus of operating system
distributors to working on the operating system and not necessarily
application software.
