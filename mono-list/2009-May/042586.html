<PRE>I've tried the example from <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/HowToSystemIOPorts">http://www.mono-project.com/HowToSystemIOPorts</A> 
with and without modification. I've also tried other examples from other 
websites, but nothing works. I didn't try to send data (right now I can't 
test it) but I tried to receive data and it just doesn't receive anything.

I'm not using the DataReceived event (I tried too, but obviously doesn't 
work). I have the right permissions. I can receive data from the same device 
when using other native programs, such as gtkterm. I'm in the uucp group. 
Running my tests as root doesn't receive anything either.

I tried Read() and ReadByte(). None of the receive anything. If I 
set &quot;ReadTimeout&quot; I always get a TimeoutException. If I don't set a timeout, 
it keeps waiting forever.

I can get the list of available serial ports using SerialPort.GetPortNames(). 
I'm setting the port name properly, because when I intentionally put it 
wrong, It throws the correct exception.

I tried both closing and not closing the port before opening it.

I tried calling the SerialPort constructor without parameters and then setting 
them one by one before calling Open(). I also tried putting all parameters 
when calling the constructor.

Mono is accessing the device, it's properly shown when I 
do &quot;lsof /dev/my_serial_port&quot;.

I can read the BaudRate, DataBits, StopBits, Parity and PortName properly.

Everything seems to work fine, but nothing is received.

I'm using a USB-serial converter, based on an FT232 chip, which works fine 
with other programs and even doing &quot;cat /dev/ttyUSB0&quot; (well, not always, but 
I think it's a configuration problem, nothing to do with this), but I can't 
receive anything with C#+Mono+linux.

What else can I try? Could it be a Mono bug?

Thank you very much
</PRE>
