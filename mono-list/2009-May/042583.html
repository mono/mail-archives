Greetings mono list,
I have an application that is currently leveraging network file share
services like SMB/CIFS or NFS to read/write remote files. If possible, I'd
really like to encapsulate all this in the app, so the user doesn't have to
bother with setting up the network file sharing before using the app; they
just launch the app and they're good to go. Perhaps embedded isn't the best
word, but basically I want the application to not be dependent on any
external network file sharing services or infrastructure, but rather handle
it all internally.

What might be the best way to go about this? I know on a low level, I could
recreate all the filesystem behavior I need in the code: directory listing,
get/set files across a socket, etc... but if I can avoid this it would be
nice as it seems like a lot of work.  I'm not overly familiar with all the
libraries available in C#, but I'm hoping, at best, there are already
libraries that allow mounting remote filesystems, or something that might
help towards that goal.

Or perhaps there's a better approach, I just don't know. That's why I'm
asking here. So any info/suggestions/ideas on this?

Thanks in advance for help.
