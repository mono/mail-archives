Greetings. Mono needs a forum for us total newbies to post questions about
applications to.

I'm so wet behind the ears that I can't tell if I'm just using mono
incorrectly, or the application isn't purely .NET (and how does one tell,
anyway?) or if the application just won't work in Mono.

For what it's worth, I've tried using Wine/winetricks to install dotnet20
with my Ubuntu linux machine pretending to be Windows2000, and .Net2.0
doesn't install properly, so I'm not sure if there's something more
fundamentally wrong.

My expectation is that Mono does not share dependencies with .Net2.0. That
is, I doubt that whatever is stopping .Net2.0 from installing under Wine is
not going to affect Mono, but I simply don't know enough about Mono to be
sure of that.

All that having been said, the application I'm trying use is a vehicle
diagnostics software package called OBD 2007 and is located at:

<A HREF="http://www.glmsoftware.com/Downloads1.aspx">http://www.glmsoftware.com/Downloads1.aspx</A>

If any kind soul would be kind enough to download it and take a look at it
and tell me if I'm completely barking up the wrong tree, I'd appreciate it.

I'm after the PC version. I already own it (I bought it) for use on a Vista
laptop, but the laptop died prematurely and it's replacement runs Ubuntu
10.04 / Wine2.0 / Mono 2.4.4

Mono Version:
Mono JIT compiler version 2.4.4 (Debian 2.4.4~svn151842-1ubuntu4)
