I'm sure this question has been asked before, however I can't seem to find it
by searching. I think I don't know the correct terms.

What I'm trying to do is make it possible for a program written in C# to
make the OS open a file or show a directory, using the OS's default programs
set to open that type of file and to explore directories. Preferably this
would be a universal way, that would work in any OS and with either Mono or
.Net.

I've tried using System.Diagnostics.Process.Start using only the
file/directory's full address as an argument. This used to work in Linux as
well but now for some reason doesn't (after upgrading Mono) and instead it
complains that the file isn't an executable.

Is this a bug in this version of Mono? Separately from the previous
question, is there a better way to do this?
