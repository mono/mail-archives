<PRE>Hello, lists:
 
I don't know if this a MonoDevelop question or a more general Mono  
question, so I'm posting to both lists.
 
We are trying to learn MonoDevelop and how it can be used for  
cross-platform builds. We've got a pretty good handle on developing with it and  figured 
out a few tricks of our own. We are using CustomCommands to some  
platform-specifc tasks and that seems to work pretty well.
 
We were wondering if xbuild supports the extensions that can be built for  
msbuild that inherit from the ITask interface. What we have in mind is 
loading  platform-specific DLL's that implement some custom tasks on Mac, Suse 
and  Windows. We need to write some platform-specific C# code for each  
platform (we think) that fiddles with operating system permissions, does  some 
file inspections and a few other things.
 
If it's not already supported, do you think there are any technology  
barriers that prevent it? If it's not a huge job, we could provide some help.  
It's not quite clear from the website whether the custom tasks are supported. 
I  usually download the source code for various Mono facilities and inspect 
it to  find such information, but maybe someone can give me a quick answer?
 
Thanks in advance
