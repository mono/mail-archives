<PRE>We are currently using custom tasks (deriving from ToolTask) in xbuild 
for a project we are working on, and they work fine.  (We use the same 
custom tasks for both xbuild and msbuild.)

Note that, by default, MonoDevelop does not use xbuild, however there is 
an option to turn on experimental xbuild support.
