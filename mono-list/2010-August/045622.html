<PRE>Does the latest mono develop work on the version of mono shipped with
ubuntu 10.04? no
Does the latest mono develop work with the version of mono shipped
with ubuntu? yes

Your argument would hold up if the above was not the cause, the
problem is that mono is moving far to fast for that approach to be
viable.

So mono develop has added badger ports to their download page. (its a
PPA for people follow this thread) but its not supported by the mono
team like on windows and mac and opensuse.

Do you realize that ubuntu has more mono users then those other
&quot;supported&quot; operating systems. The banshee usage stats prove this.
Windows has first class support and yet no one uses mono on windows
because .net is faster and more stable. Even mono develop for windows
runs on .net and not on mono.

How much effort does the mono team go to create mono installers for
windows? isn't that the responsibility of Microsoft to make mono work
on windows?

What about Mac how much effort does the mono team spend making mono
run on Mac isn't that the responsibility of Apple?

So it's not about user base. The has been as must as stated on here
that its because ubuntu is linux. So the mono team doesn't support
ubuntu because its a linux distro. Linux distro  are not important to
the mono team. Closed operating systems are much more important. Even
if people don't use mono on those closed systems. The exception is
openuses which just so happens to be funded by Novell.... interesting
how that works....

I just finished lessening to the ubuntu uk podcast in which they
interview Jo Shields aka directhex (the guy who maintains the
badgerports PPA) and what he says about mono on ubuntu is quite
interesting and is definitely worth a listen. Here is the link
<A HREF="http://podcast.ubuntu-uk.org/2010/07/21/s03e12-the-country-fair/">http://podcast.ubuntu-uk.org/2010/07/21/s03e12-the-country-fair/</A>

Ubuntu is one of the most mono accepting non novell distros out there
in terms of what mono applications they include by default, but what
we get from mono team amounts to a slap in the face.

Does windows include mono applications by default? no. Does apple? no.
Does ubuntu? yes. So how does mono thank ubuntu for its support? by
giving it the big middle finger.

Microsoft and Apple do not package mono or include mono by default.
And mono thanks them for this by providing them with first class
support.

It doesn't make any sense to me at all.

(I sent the email to the sender by mistake because the reply button in
gmail replies to the sender not the list.)
