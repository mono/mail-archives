I totally concur with this, and anyway, when someone in the thread said
that most Mono users actually come from the usage of Mono applications
in Ubuntu, that doesn't mean that the Mono team providing Ubuntu
packages would target more users. Why? Because you have to remember that
F-Spot (at least) comes by default in Ubuntu, thus Ubuntu comes with all
the necessary things to run Mono apps by default. Providing packages
would only be for the *advanced* user that installs updated versions of
mono apps.

Regards,

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> look at the homepages of pretty much any software available on Ubuntu
</I>&gt;<i> and note that they don't provide packages, just tarballs. That's how
</I>&gt;<i> things work in the Linux world. I think we all understand your

</I>&gt;<i> compile your own Mono if you want, you can use Jo's PPA if you prefer,
</I>&gt;<i> there's basically a bunch of different ways to update Mono on your
</I>&gt;<i> system with little effort.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You might not like how the Linux packaging process works, but that's
</I>&gt;<i> how it is, and discussing the pros and cons of particular philosophy
</I>&gt;<i> is a topic for other mailing lists, I think.
