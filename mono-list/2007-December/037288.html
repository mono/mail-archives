Ok, I understand now. It's true that GDI+, and libgdiplus in our case,
returns OutOfMemory for a lot of things that aren't memory related. In
fact it seems many NULL checks return OutOfMemory :(

&gt;<i> &gt; FromStream can have some issues on Win32 (only) since the way MS deals
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with loading requires the stream to be alive as long as the image.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks, good to know.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (snip errors when pinvoking GetVolumeInformationA)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Have a look at pinvoke.net
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Uh, it just occured to me - will pinvoking this even WORK on Linux,
</I>&gt;<i> even if I get it to compile?  
</I>
No, it will work with Mono on Windows but not on Linux.

&gt;<i> I do have Wine installed, so I have a
</I>&gt;<i> version of this function somewhere, but getting Mono to find it sounds
</I>&gt;<i> like a huge hassle.  
</I>
As of today Mono doesn't run under Wine.

&gt;<i> Surely .NET has its own equivalent that could be
</I>&gt;<i> called natively?
</I>
There are some similar API in the FX. Not all of them are currently
supported by Mono, but someone is working on some of them (check
mono-list and mono-devel mailing list archives).

&gt;<i> Thanks for the help,
</I>&gt;<i> Joe
</I>
Good luck!
Sebastien
