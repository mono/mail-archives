Dear Mono,

I have just upgraded from 1.2.5 to 1.2.6.

The startup problem I was getting on 1.2.5 has now gone:

[Tue Sep 25 14:24:20 2007] [crit] Failed to remove dashboard file
'/tmp/mod_mono_dashboard_XXGLOBAL_1', further actions impossible.
Operation not permitted

Many thanks!  It was driving me mad as I had to take an entire server 
offline to upgrade Mono code.

However I now have a new startup problem:

[Fri Dec 21 09:18:28 2007] [crit] (17)File exists: Failed to create 
shared memory segment for backend 'XXGLOBAL'

This does not cause as many problems, but the mod_mono Control Panel 
does not work all the time.

Any ideas???

Thanks again,

Ben Clewett.
