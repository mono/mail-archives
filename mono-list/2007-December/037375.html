Dear Mono,

I have a new Webservice running under Apache 2.2.3 and mono 1.2.6.

Approximately 1 in 4 times mono does not connect to Apache correctly.

The Mono Webservice has started, I can tell as it spawns a thread to 
process data, which processes indefinitely.  However the connection to 
Apache seems broken.

This is from my apache error log on start:

** (/usr/lib/mono/1.0/mod-mono-server.exe:10744): WARNING **: 
_wapi_thread_set_termination_details: error looking up thread handle (nil)
[notice] Apache/2.2.3 (Linux/SUSE) configured -- resuming normal operations
[error] Failed to connect to mod-mono-server after several attempts to 
spawn the process.
[error] Failed to connect to mod-mono-server after several attempts to 
spawn the process.
[error] Failed (etc)

Do any members know if I can do something to try and avoid this problem?

Regards,

Ben.

PS, this also suffers this problem every time I start:

[crit] (17)File exists: Failed to create shared memory segment for 
backend 'XXGLOBAL'

But this seems to be irrelevant as this occurs every restart, the above 
problem only occurs 1/4 of the time.
