<PRE>I am very interested in using 'mkbundle --deps file.cs' to see if I can
effectively get a static executable for a small project I'm working on, but
the errors I get when trying to do this make no sense to me. And,
unfortunately, i have found mono thus far to be incredibly un-user-friendly
and the documentation to be non-existent, and when it exists, very hard to
track down. I am not trying to be disrespectful but it makes things
needlessly frustrating to not have a StartHere.txt or something to that
effect.

The particulars:
Running v2.10.8 on Windows 7 Ultimate
The basic Hello.cs compiles and executes properly.
getting error CS0234: The type or namespace name '(getting one each for
Data, Drawing, and Windows)' does not exist in the namespace 'System'. Are
you missing an assembly reference?

I spent several hours trying to find answers on where to go with that error
and got nowhere. At one point I was advised in the Mono command prompt to
check the GTK_PKG_something setting/variable, but, of course, there's no
documentation that I could find anywhere telling where to actually set this
variable.

Do the designers of Mono assume I already know the ins and outs of Linux or
something? I don't understand. I literally just need to run mkbundle for a
specific project and see if it works or not. That's all. What's most
furstrating of all is I got the plugin for Visual Studio, and can
successfully run this project through Mono using the menus in VS, but again
it's very unclear how to compile it from there, versus just doing a test
run.
