But it's possible for the &quot;compiled code&quot; that the CLR is executing to
be an interpreter, which in turn executes a scripting language.

Which is what IronPython could do, if it didn't care about
performance...

&lt;snip/&gt;

&gt;<i>  Hi i am new to mono and since i saw nothing mentioned in documentation i

Mono doesn't offer a VBScript implementation.  VB.NET != VBScript, and
it's highly doubtful that Microsoft VBScript would work with Mono.

Consequently, either create your own scripting language, use IronPython,
or hit Google.  I think someone had created some Scheme-like
interpreters for .NET which might work with Mono...

&gt;<i> if not are there
</I>&gt;<i> any plans to include an oficial scripting language for mono with monodevelop
</I>&gt;<i> suport also?
</I>
I haven't heard of any such plans.

&gt;<i> And an offtopic question; isnt it dangerous to implement winforms and
</I>&gt;<i> asp.net 
</I>&gt;<i> which hasnt been submited by microsoft as standart to ecma?    
</I>
That's why we have Gtk#.  And until Microsoft starts complaining, we'll
be implementing both ASP.NET and Winforms to simplify developers lives
(simplifying portability).
