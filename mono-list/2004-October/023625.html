<PRE>On the subject of switches on strings, I tested how mcs and the Mono runtime 
performed. Specifically, I tested the code that mcs produces for switches on 
strings versus nested if-statements for a three-way decision. The 
if-statement version was substantally faster (about 3-5 times, as I recall). 
The difference was due to how mcs handles switch statements. Using a 
different C# compiler, there was no difference between if-statements and 
switch under the Mono runtime.
