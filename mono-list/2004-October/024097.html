<PRE>&gt;<i> -----Original Message-----
</I>&gt;<i> From: Paolo Molaro &lt;<A HREF="mailto:lupus@ximian.com">lupus@ximian.com</A>&gt;

</I>
Can you be more specific about why Java is &quot;close [but not] good enough&quot; =
for a good development platform? I'm not trying to be argumentative, =
just to understand your position. Another way to put this is, say .Net =
didn't exist, why would I develop a product today with mono instead of =
Java, strictly on its own merits?

&gt;<i> IMHO, if they decide to attack Mono, as detailed in the FAQ, if they
</I>&gt;<i> have patents that can stand in court, we'll remove the features or
</I>&gt;<i> work around the patents. This may break compatibility, but we have our
</I>&gt;<i> own code and we'll adapt it.
</I>
I read that in the FAQ. Why not do it now and make mono completely =
unencumbered? You say that compatibility isn't the primary concern. An =
IP-free implementation would eliminate any legal doubt that is slowing =
down commercial adoption. More adoption means more users and developers =
and a better environment, right?

I think you underestimate the paranoia of lawyers, especially at big =
companies. Although you and I can recognize FUD for what it is, lawyers =
take more convincing.
