We use codebehind as much as possible. A recursive wget will, I realise,
get our service primed for the first user asap, but in the case where we
are considering using mono we estimate several requests a second so a
customer will most likely get there first -- and they will get to
experience the 5-15 seconds delay before the service is ready.

I assume that mono compiles the asmx-files into a class that goes
somewhere I havn't found yet. It would be okay for me to build a
deployment site where we could force a page-by-page compilation and then
deploy the generated classes/dll's to the production site.

But I guess that is not possible either since no one has suggested it...

Morten Krog
