Ok, uhm, i dont understand why this is a problem. MonoDevelop cant just
guess what your files are.

&gt;<i>  You can't just copy 
</I>&gt;<i> some images or an image directory into a folder. It's meant to deal with 
</I>&gt;<i> source. 
</I>
As opposed to what? allowing you to add a image file to the project? I
believe that a) this is possible today b) doesnt serve much of a point.

&gt;<i> And even then it doesn't seem to handle integrating its view of a 
</I>&gt;<i> project with the filesystem (like Eclipse does, for example).
</I>
Explain exactly what that means, because where I'm sitting (and I use
MonoDevelop every day for 8 hours a day) it absolutely integrates its
view of a project with the filesystem.

I have this in MonoDevelop:

MyProject
&gt;<i> src
</I> &gt; SomeFile.cs
 &gt; SomeFolder
  &gt; SomeOtherFile.cs

and on my filesystem I have
MyProjectFolder/src/SomeFolder/SomeOtherFile.cs
