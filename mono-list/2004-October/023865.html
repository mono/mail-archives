It depends on the assembly.  Assuming you want to test mscorlib.dll and
System.dll, then you're out of luck.  Mscorlib.dll, in particular, has a
large number of &quot;internal calls&quot; (like P/Invoke, but into the runtime,
not into an arbitrary library); as such, mscorlib.dll is tied to a
single CLR implementation, and can't be used in another (unless the CLR
implementations agree on their internal calls, but this is unlikely).

System.dll and other assemblies also make use of internal calls, so
they're not portable.  However, if you only use types which *don't* use
internal calls, you should be safe, but it's not easy to tell which
types use internal calls...  (Use monodis and grep for &quot;internalcall&quot;.)
