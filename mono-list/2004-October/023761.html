</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Eclipse, as an example, is far different. If you're doing web development, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as I mentioned earlier, you often need to just throw a new directory or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some images into the same directory as the rest of your projct. Often this 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will be because it's all part of one big CVS checkout, right. Eclipse will 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pickup these filesystem changes and if you do a refresh they're suddenly 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the project directory. No needing to add them from a window. So, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; frankly, I'm not used to that behavior, nor do I think it's optimal. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Additionally I've noticed that sometimes if I add a file or folder, if I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then delete it it will show as deleted, but actually still exist in the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; filesystem. This is odd behavior to me.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I see what you mean, but then you would get random stuff, like temporary
</I>&gt;<i> files, or build cruft, or random stuff you arent interested in in your
</I>&gt;<i> project as well. Is that desired?
</I>
Of course not. But other IDEs (take a look at IDEA I believe Eclipse)
just filter these files out. They filter .hidden files out on Unix and
they filter out CVS directories as just a matter of course. So I've
never found that to be a problem with other IDEs.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;  You can't just copy 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; some images or an image directory into a folder. It's meant to deal with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; source. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; As opposed to what? allowing you to add a image file to the project? I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; believe that a) this is possible today b) doesnt serve much of a point.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, if you're doing a web development project, having an image as part 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of your project DOES serve much of a point. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Only in the sense of deployment, and considering we don't really deal
</I>&gt;<i> with deployment (either generic, or web deployment) yet, it is
</I>&gt;<i> relatively moot at this time.
</I>
I suppose. The way I was trying to use Monodevelop was for a quick site
I was building. So I wanted to throw everything in the same directory so
I could run XSP right out of that directory. Having to run a build on a 
few code-behind classes isn't really optimal for my situation. Thus the
reason why I asked about IDEs that fit my particular situation.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; And even then it doesn't seem to handle integrating its view of a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; project with the filesystem (like Eclipse does, for example).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Explain exactly what that means, because where I'm sitting (and I use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; MonoDevelop every day for 8 hours a day) it absolutely integrates its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; view of a project with the filesystem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What I mean is if I copy a directory into my project folder I can't see 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it via MonoDevelop. It's not there. This is different behavior than I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; used to with other IDEs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure, but I believe vs.net works in the same way.
</I>
If it works that way for web projects I think that would be a break from
the past.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; MyProjectFolder/src/SomeFolder/SomeOtherFile.cs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I have this in MonoDevelop:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; MyProject
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; src
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  &gt; SomeFile.cs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  &gt; SomeFolder
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   &gt; SomeOtherFile.cs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and on my filesystem I have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Right. Probably because you put them there. But what if you just copied a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; directory into your project folder. Would you be able to see it in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Monodevelop? I don't in my copy.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yup, I added the files and directories I am interested in.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As miguel said, it would be trivial to write code that watches your
</I>&gt;<i> directories and automatically adds files to the project, but is that
</I>&gt;<i> really the best option?
</I>
No. I think the best option is to find an IDE for Linux that does mono,
but looks at a project like a folder in which your files exist and not
as some filesystem on top of a filesystem, which is where problems like
mine begin.

&gt;<i> I store random files that I am not interested in seeing in my project
</I>&gt;<i> inside the project folder.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, when MD integrates with revision control, this behaviour becomes
</I>&gt;<i> sub-optimal as well. You don't want stuff like that automatically
</I>&gt;<i> 'added' and at the same time, you do want your project to accurately
</I>&gt;<i> represent your revision control repository, because in theory (or
</I>&gt;<i> reality) whatever you are storing in revision control is most likely
</I>&gt;<i> something you are interested in working with.
</I>
Yes, but what happens when some day you want to add an image or a Flash
file, things that people have to do in real life, to the project.
There's no facility for that, save for what I was trying to do, copying
the file to the directory. There has to be a way, if it's ever to be
used for ASP.NET development, to handle the diversity of files
(properties files, xml files, images, swf files, etc.) that gets thrown
into a web app.

&gt;<i> I am totally up for ideas on how to work all this out, and any patch
</I>&gt;<i> work would be reviewed, and commented upon (and most likely accepted). I
</I>&gt;<i> would prefer to see some discussion about potential pros/cons of
</I>&gt;<i> automatically adding files to your project, and other points I brought
</I>&gt;<i> up here.
</I>
I don't disagree. I wasn't attempting to redirect the focus of
monodevelop when I posted what I posted. I was simply looking for other
IDE options. 

&gt;<i> However, this discussion should take place on the monodevelop-list
</I>&gt;<i> (which is accessible through the lists.ximian.com website).
</I>
Agreed.
