<PRE>I just need to do some ASP.nET development. Monodevelop is great for 
classes, but I can't seem to get it to work right (or else it just doesn't 
do what I think it should do) in the capacity of working on a web 
application. The main problem being that in Monodevelop every folder and 
file has to be added to the project from the menu. You can't just copy 
some images or an image directory into a folder. It's meant to deal with 
source. And even then it doesn't seem to handle integrating its view of a 
project with the filesystem (like Eclipse does, for example). Yet 
Eclipse's C# plugin, from what I've heard, doesn't have code completion. 
So what am I to do? I need a sane IDE that can view the files in the 
system and let me work on them and do some code completion. Monodevelop 
seemingly can't do this. Any other ideas?
