&gt;<i> I didn't find Microsoft's position to be negative at all.  I agree that
</I>ease
&gt;<i> of use and standardization is needed on Linux platforms.  Mono provides
</I>exactly that.  I've been programming mostly with Microsoft Visual C# for
the
&gt;<i> past year or two and I find it fairly easy to learn to program with C#
</I>on Mono.  If I had to use another language, I'd be completely lost.  I'm
only guessing, but Mono could lead to a flood of applications being
developed for
&gt;<i> Linux platforms which would only increase the attraction to Linux.
</I>
Taken on its own, I'd have to ask why?  You'd be hard pressed to name an
application on Windows that doesn't have at least one counterpart on
Linux. The availability of software isn't an issue for Linux.

&gt;<i>  I like
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft products because so many people are using them that there's q=
</I>uite
&gt;<i> a body of knowledge floating around amongst general users, but I'm not
</I>opposed to competition.

This body exists in the Linux community as well.  The problem is in
finding members of the community that are willing to help others,
especially newbies.  RTFM is usually the nicest and most helpful response
you get (even though you've read the FM and the answer to your question i=
s
either not there, or can only be understood by someone who already knows
the answer).

&gt;<i>  I find Linux to be difficult to work with, but
</I>&gt;<i> I'm
</I>&gt;<i> sure it's only because I'm unfamiliar with it.
</I>
Don't bet on that:  <A HREF="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cups-horror.html.">http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cups-horror.html.</A>
This is the biggest issue that Linux has to address, and all Linux
developers should keep this in mind at all times.  (Though I agree with
some articles that have spawned from this one that assert the developers
are the ones least likely to be able to fix the issue... the open source
world needs to start attracting people with skills other than programming=
.
 I've seen a few starting steps in the area of documentation, but what's
needed more is people with skills in interface design, including usabilit=
y
testing.)

&gt;<i>  Competition is a good
</I>&gt;<i> thing
</I>&gt;<i> for consumers.  I want to thank Microsoft for making C# open source and
</I>I want to thank Novell and all the people who have worked on Mono for
giving us more options instead of less.

Fully agree.
