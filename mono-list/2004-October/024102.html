</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IMHO, if they decide to attack Mono, as detailed in the FAQ, if they

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I read that in the FAQ. Why not do it now and make mono completely unencumbered? You say that compatibility isn't the primary concern. An IP-free implementation would eliminate any legal doubt that is slowing down commercial adoption. More adoption means more users and developers and a better environment, right?
</I>
Thats not really how it works. If there were four active patents
total, and they were all by Microsoft about things within the .Net
Framework - then sure, it would make sense to avoid it. But patents
are a horrible reality of the software engineering environment today.
You really cannot tie your own shoes without violating someone's
patent anymore - and at that point, it really becomes a business and
legal problem.

In addition. the penalties for patent infringement skyrocket if you
knowingly violate a patent. It is far better to just not look, play
ignorant to the whole issue, and be reactionary.

Or to summarize, in response to the 'why not switch now' question, my
follow-on question would be 'to what?' What is there in any software
engineering vertical which is not potentially patent-encombered in the
US? _Every_ open-source project has an equal potential for patent
infringement. Mono just gets a much larger amount of FUD over it
because villifying Microsoft is so easy and fashionable.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think you underestimate the paranoia of lawyers, especially at big companies. Although you and I can recognize FUD for what it is, lawyers take more convincing.
</I>
When there are enforced patents on ideas like 'plugins' and 'having
one program help another', lawyers really need to change their outlook
on what is the best outlook on patents.
