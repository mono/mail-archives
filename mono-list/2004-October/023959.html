Thanks for the tips on the other locations and these notes.  I'm sure
they will help immensely

&gt;<i> I would think that the process would be very analogous for porting &quot;The

</I>&gt;<i> others; however, I would point out that the Time Tracker app varies from
</I>&gt;<i> the others in at least as much as it only supports Windows authentication

</I>&gt;<i> useful) candidate.
</I>
The main reason I was interested in the Time Tracker is it was something
I was going to do anyway.  But I need to do both at some point.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you need any help in the process, let me know, I'd be happy to lend a

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I'm more of a PostgreSQL guy myself, so I'll probably want to do
that first instead of MySQL.

&gt;<i> Also, I know we'd love to add some more of these kinds of projects to the
</I>&gt;<i> list over at GotMono.
</I>
I'll probably setup an account on Novell Forge here soon for it.  I 
just can't stand not having version control.  

Thanks.  I was looking through some of these apps, I may use BlogX.
