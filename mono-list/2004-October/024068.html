<PRE>I agree, Amanda Morgan actually says in the second paragraph: &quot;Frankly, Mono
is just one example of the level of excitement within the developer
community around .NET. &quot;  That sure doesn't sound like a FUD of Mono to me.
It sounds to me like Amanda is simply saying &quot;we're not involved with Mono,
but they are creating something just like the .NET framework because it's an
exciting platform&quot;.   As far as FUD goes, I think people will pull what they
want out of what other people say because they have a bias and it serves
their agenda.  Sociology 101 really.

Subject: RE: [Mono-list] Ask Microsoft: Mono support

I didn't find Microsoft's position to be negative at all.  I agree that ease
of use and standardization is needed on Linux platforms.  Mono provides
exactly that.  I've been programming mostly with Microsoft Visual C# for the
past year or two and I find it fairly easy to learn to program with C# on
Mono.  If I had to use another language, I'd be completely lost.  I'm only
guessing, but Mono could lead to a flood of applications being developed for
Linux platforms which would only increase the attraction to Linux.  I like
Microsoft products because so many people are using them that there's quite
a body of knowledge floating around amongst general users, but I'm not
opposed to competition.  I find Linux to be difficult to work with, but I'm
sure it's only because I'm unfamiliar with it.  Competition is a good thing
for consumers.  I want to thank Microsoft for making C# open source and I
want to thank Novell and all the people who have worked on Mono for giving
us more options instead of less.
