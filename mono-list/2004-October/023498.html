That's likely to happen if you use the managed file system watcher, not
with FAM, for large directories (many files), but not for directories
that have, say, 1 hundred files (unless the computer is too slow). The
refresh interval is set to 750ms in the managed watcher. Can you check
whether you're using FAM or Default file watchers? (adding a Console in
FileSystemWatcher where the choice is taken).

</I>&gt;<i> too busy to pick up a connection, will mod_mono spawn a new 
</I>&gt;<i> mod_mono_server?)
</I>
That used to happen if you get a few requests when mod_mono has not
started mod-mono-server for the first time. After the burst only one of
those mono instances is really used. I'll file a bug report about this
and fix it.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is each child httpd supposed to start its own mod_mono_server?  Is 
</I>&gt;<i> mod-mono-server able to process multiple requests concurrently?  Is the 
</I>&gt;<i> unix socket to mod-mono-server able to support connections from multiple 
</I>&gt;<i> httpd children?
</I>
No, if it wasn't because of the mentioned bug, one mod-mono-server
handles all the incoming connections from the children.
