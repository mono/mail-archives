<PRE> Hi!

Thanks for info. But these are really bad news since my web apps have to
conform to W3C standards. Anyway its strange that standards driven Open
Source community created non compliant ASP.NET implementation. Hope this can
be fixed.

Currently I got standards conformance implemented under .NET 1.1 ASP.NET by
&quot;cleaning&quot; HTML in overriden Page.Render() method which replaces several non
standard attributes and fixes javascript which is partly broken by that
operation (for Internet Explorer only). My worry is that output from Mono
ASP.NET could differ somewhat from MS ASP.NET and as a result I would have
to analyze Mono ASP.NET implementation and code cleaning stuff again.

Has anyone knowledge on that?

Cheers

Jacek

PS My knowledge and experience is that HTML 4.0 and XHTML 1.0 compliance is
provided by ASP.NET 2.0 only.

you can do xhtml 1.0 transitional as of the 1.1 .net framework, not 100% on
mono, as the &lt;form&gt; tag will use a name attribute which doesn't validate
under strict... not sure if this will change.
