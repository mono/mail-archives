But other IDEs aren't trying to manage their own separate filesystem. 
Eclipse, as an example, is far different. If you're doing web development, 
as I mentioned earlier, you often need to just throw a new directory or 
some images into the same directory as the rest of your projct. Often this 
will be because it's all part of one big CVS checkout, right. Eclipse will 
pickup these filesystem changes and if you do a refresh they're suddenly 
in the project directory. No needing to add them from a window. So, 
frankly, I'm not used to that behavior, nor do I think it's optimal. 
Additionally I've noticed that sometimes if I add a file or folder, if I 
then delete it it will show as deleted, but actually still exist in the 
filesystem. This is odd behavior to me.

Well, if you're doing a web development project, having an image as part 
of your project DOES serve much of a point. 

&gt;<i> &gt; And even then it doesn't seem to handle integrating its view of a

What I mean is if I copy a directory into my project folder I can't see 
it via MonoDevelop. It's not there. This is different behavior than I'm 
used to with other IDEs.
 
&gt;<i> MyProjectFolder/src/SomeFolder/SomeOtherFile.cs

</I>&gt;<i>   &gt; SomeOtherFile.cs
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and on my filesystem I have

Right. Probably because you put them there. But what if you just copied a 
directory into your project folder. Would you be able to see it in 
Monodevelop? I don't in my copy.
