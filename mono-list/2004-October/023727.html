<PRE>Is your Grid sample referencing anything in Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll?  I
believe VS.NET references this library by default when compiling VB.NET
projects.

Subject: [Mono-list] Language Clarification

I realize that Mono focuses its development on C# as a whole, but I'm
wondering something about other languages in general.  I'm no expert on the
core of .NET, but I was under the impression that one of its features is
that code from any .NET language, when compiled, becomes a single common
language for any .NET interpreter (such as Mono) to use.
That is, if I write something in VB and compile it in Visual Studio, the end
result is no different (not critically different, anyway) from the end
result that would be achieved had I used C# or any other .NET language.  Is
this the case?

If so, then I'm unclear on a problem that I've been having (and have been
receiving very help assistance on, thanks to this mailing list) in trying to
get an ASP .NET web application written in VB to work on Mono.

I was told of a work-around to get my first test page to work, which was to
set the page language to C# even though my code-behind was all in VB.
This worked... for that small test page (which consisted of a button which,
when pressed, changed a property on a label).  My next test was to use a
DataGrid and grab a table from a database.  This page is slightly more
complex as a test, since it has more functions in the code-behind and has
some VB code in the design of the .aspx file itself.
The aforementioned work-around doesn't seem to extend this far, as setting
my page language to C# now results in a vague &quot;object reference not set to
an instance of an object&quot; error (with no obvious mention of the object in
question).  And, of course, setting it back to VB results in a &quot;thread was
being aborted&quot; error that caused the need for the aforementioned
work-around.

If my originally mentioned impression of how .NET works is correct, why is
there a difference between the two at all?  When I compile my &quot;solution&quot; in
Visual Studio, isn't the resulting .dll in the bin folder contain all that
Mono needs?  If so, is my method of compilation not accomplishing this
properly?

For reference, I am using the following setup:
Development:
  Windows XP, .NET Framework 1.1.4322, Visual Studio .NET 2003
(7.1.3088)
Production:
  Slackware 10.0, Linux 2.4.26, Mono 1.1.1 (mod_mono with Apache 1.3.31)
