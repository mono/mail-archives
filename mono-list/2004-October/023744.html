Very much true. Mono's VB.NET compiler is progressing in this
direction.

mbas is awfully slow right now (fair enough considering that mbas is an

alpha code) and is tortoise when compared to mcs. So this is one reason

why a page coded in VB has some trouble being rendered.

Btw, as I have shared with you already your test.zip runs successfully
without any modification whatsoever on my test box.

As I said, we are in the middle of the journey and we are there, well 
almost and we need patrons like you to keep us all excited ;-)

</I>I realize that Mono focuses its development on C# as a whole, but I'm
wondering something about other languages in general.  I'm no expert
on
the core of .NET, but I was under the impression that one of its
features is that code from any .NET language, when compiled, becomes a
single common language for any .NET interpreter (such as Mono) to use.
That is, if I write something in VB and compile it in Visual Studio,
the
end result is no different (not critically different, anyway) from the
end result that would be achieved had I used C# or any other .NET
language.  Is this the case?

If so, then I'm unclear on a problem that I've been having (and have
been receiving very help assistance on, thanks to this mailing list)
in
trying to get an ASP .NET web application written in VB to work on
Mono.

I was told of a work-around to get my first test page to work, which
was
to set the page language to C# even though my code-behind was all in
VB.
This worked... for that small test page (which consisted of a button
which, when pressed, changed a property on a label).  My next test was
to use a DataGrid and grab a table from a database.  This page is
slightly more complex as a test, since it has more functions in the
code-behind and has some VB code in the design of the .aspx file
itself.
The aforementioned work-around doesn't seem to extend this far, as
setting my page language to C# now results in a vague &quot;object
reference
not set to an instance of an object&quot; error (with no obvious mention of
the object in question).  And, of course, setting it back to VB
results
in a &quot;thread was being aborted&quot; error that caused the need for the
aforementioned work-around.

If my originally mentioned impression of how .NET works is correct,
why
is there a difference between the two at all?  When I compile my
&quot;solution&quot; in Visual Studio, isn't the resulting .dll in the bin
folder
contain all that Mono needs?  If so, is my method of compilation not
accomplishing this properly?

For reference, I am using the following setup:
Development:
  Windows XP, .NET Framework 1.1.4322, Visual Studio .NET 2003
(7.1.3088)
Production:
  Slackware 10.0, Linux 2.4.26, Mono 1.1.1 (mod_mono with Apache
1.3.31)
