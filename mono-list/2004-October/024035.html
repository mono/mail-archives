&gt;<i> I want to start working on the Microsoft.visualbasic class.
</I>
Thanks a lot.  Kindly post all future VB related communications to
mono-vb list: <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-vb">http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-vb</A> 

&gt;<i> How can I build and run the unit test for just that class?
</I>
General information regarding test suite organization for a typical
mono dll can be found under at:

<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/contributing/testing.html#unit">http://www.mono-project.com/contributing/testing.html#unit</A> 

More specifically, MSVB.dll has two set of test cases: 1) nunit test
cases 2) standalone test cases.

The nunit test cases reside under under
mcs/class/Microsoft.VisualBasic/Test/Microsoft.VisualBasic
directory. You can run compile test dlls by issuing 'make test' under
mcs/class/Microsoft.VisualBasic.You can run all the nunit tests by
issuing 'make run-test' under the same directory. The results are
written to a xml file.


The standalone test cases reside under
mcs/class/Microsoft.VisualBasic/Test/standalone directory. These test
cases were contributed by mainsoft and do not use nunit
framework. These tests also exercise the MSVB modules and they can
typically be run as follows:

mbas 5056.vb MainModule.vb
mono 5056.exe

The MainModule.vb provides the Main() entry point for all the numbered
test cases. You may want to write a small script or even a makefile
which would automate the drudgery. (You may want to hack the
execute.sh in the same directory and come up with a new compileand
execute.sh.)

There are two important namespaces in Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll:
Microsoft.VisualBasic and Microsoft.VisualBasic.CompilerServices. The
former namespace is well documented while the later is largely
undocumented and references to this namespace is typically emitted
when a .NET executable is created by the VB.NET compiler. The later
namespace is mainly for binary compatibility purposes. The later
namespace get exercised when you take a MS VB executable and run it
under mono. The latter namespace is extremely critical for this very
reason.

If you are planning to write new MSVB test cases, we encourage you to
provide them as nunit test cases written in VB.NET ;-). If you would
like to 
help us with MSVBCS namespaces then we encourage you to contribute 
the test cases under standalone directory or better still as mbas test

cases which can be found under mcs/mbas/Test.

If you need information wrt writing mbas test cases do drop me a mail
and I will be happy to share the same with you. There were some reorg
that we did under mbas/Test directory and the readme is still pending
after the reorg.

Regards,
Jambunathan K.
