Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt; First - why are you doing this as root? Root is there for a purpose
</I>&gt;<i> and it=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; isn't just so you don't have to keep typing su to change to it. On a=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; machine, it can be considered a major deity. It has the power of life,
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; death and existance on a box. Mess something up as root and you can=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (and probably *will*) do some serious damage!
</I>&gt;<i> As in the real world: if you have rights you can missuse them. If you
</I>&gt;<i> don't have any rights, you can't do your job.
</I>
You've missed the point. You do everything as a user and until you need
to (for instance, installing into a directory owned by root, such
as /usr or /var), you stay like that. As a user, you have all the rights
you need.

&gt;<i> &gt; Second, is this a compile from cvs and if it is, is it via and update=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and if it is from an update, what happens if you ditch that version of
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mono/mcs and do a fresh checkout?
</I>&gt;<i> This is a compile from the &quot;daily build&quot; downloaded from the mono
</I>&gt;<i> website. Nothing CVS or similar.
</I>
Try the cvs route - it's much easier to bugtrack!

&gt;<i> &gt; Third, what distro are you using? I know with Fedora Core, things
</I>&gt;<i> aren't=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; always happy in that /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig isn't always checked -=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this could be something similar.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, I had really forgotten this important information. Here it is:
</I>&gt;<i> RedHat 9
</I>
RH9 was fine with pkgconfig in /usr/local/lib

&gt;<i> &gt; Fourth, when you ran autogen.sh, did you specify anything with --
</I>&gt;<i> prefix=3D?=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (ie. --prefix=3D/usr). Again, problems can occur if you're in as root o=
</I>r
&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have specified somewhere insane for your libraries and apps to live.
</I>&gt;<i> I used following lines:
</I>&gt;<i> ./autogen.sh --prefix=3D/usr
</I>&gt;<i> make
</I>&gt;<i> make install			&lt;---- here it crashes because of the
</I>&gt;<i> missing file
</I>
As I say, use the cvs route. Full instructions are at
