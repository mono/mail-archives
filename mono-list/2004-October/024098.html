<PRE>Hi!=20

&gt;<i> &gt; When I want to install the daily build of 2004-10-26 (and -24), I
</I>get=20
&gt;<i> &gt; following error while &quot;make install&quot;:
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; The file monoresgen.exe.mdb hasn't been there...
</I>
&gt;<i> First - why are you doing this as root? Root is there for a purpose
</I>and it=20
&gt;<i> isn't just so you don't have to keep typing su to change to it. On a=20
</I>&gt;<i> machine, it can be considered a major deity. It has the power of life,
</I>
&gt;<i> death and existance on a box. Mess something up as root and you can=20
</I>&gt;<i> (and probably *will*) do some serious damage!
</I>As in the real world: if you have rights you can missuse them. If you
don't have any rights, you can't do your job.

&gt;<i> Second, is this a compile from cvs and if it is, is it via and update=20
</I>&gt;<i> and if it is from an update, what happens if you ditch that version of
</I>
&gt;<i> mono/mcs and do a fresh checkout?
</I>This is a compile from the &quot;daily build&quot; downloaded from the mono
website. Nothing CVS or similar.

&gt;<i> Third, what distro are you using? I know with Fedora Core, things
</I>aren't=20
&gt;<i> always happy in that /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig isn't always checked -=20
</I>&gt;<i> this could be something similar.
</I>Sorry, I had really forgotten this important information. Here it is:
RedHat 9

&gt;<i> Fourth, when you ran autogen.sh, did you specify anything with --
</I>prefix=3D?=20
&gt;<i> (ie. --prefix=3D/usr). Again, problems can occur if you're in as root =
</I>or

&gt;<i> have specified somewhere insane for your libraries and apps to live.
</I>I used following lines:
./autogen.sh --prefix=3D/usr
make
make install			&lt;---- here it crashes because of the
missing file

Thanks for any help!

Regards
Jochen
