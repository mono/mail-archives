Hi,

To cut my story short, I've installed gtk-sharp from source. And now 
when I tried to Import VS.NET file from MD, the MD doesnt not disappear 
anymore as it previously it did. However, I'm getting error 'Cannot open 
assembly.., reference from....'. One of the error was cannot open 
assembly MonoDevelop.Base, but I have MonoDevelop.Base.dll. Can anyone 
point out what I miss here??

Am I getting off topic here and should go to MonoDevelop mailing list?

Many thanks for those who has helped me.

Kusuma
