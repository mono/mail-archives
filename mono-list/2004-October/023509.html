No it may not be, but, combined with the set of tools I have available
on my computer, it is part of one.

&gt;<i> Emacs with ECB and semantic, for Java &amp; C[++] comes quite close though.

The key word here is the 'Integrated' in IDE - IDE is not synonymous
with 'Development Environment' and this is precisely the point that I
was trying to make - there is always going to be a divergence of opinion
between those who believe that development is best done using a single
monolithic application and those who would rather use a carefully chosen
set of individual tools.

&gt;<i> It's a fact, and although some 4-5 years ago comparing
</I>&gt;<i> :w or CxCs with mouse clicks was funny, now it's simply ridiculous.
</I>&gt;<i> Take a look around, everything is moving towards that direction, from
</I>&gt;<i> big (all Java IDEs, VS, SlickEdit) to small (kdevelop, anjuta, emacs +
</I>&gt;<i> xrefactory,ecb etc.).
</I>
*Shrug* I don't know about anyone else but I find that I can't write
code with a mouse and I find it really annoying to have to take my hands
away from the keyboard in order to perform some basic operation.  Of
course this would suggest that the human anatomy is not complete and
won't be ready for the big time until we have evolved a third hand with
which to operate a mouse :-)
