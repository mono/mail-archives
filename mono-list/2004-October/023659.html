Hi Mike,

If you find wrapping CGI at your current ISP to be too much work, there
are a couple of alternatives.

We offer Mono 1.0.2 hosting at www.cityhost.ca and we're more than happy
to provide you with a 1-month trial account, if you like. If you're
hosting a site for an open source project, we will host that for free
(the Tomboy and MonoDevelop sites are hosted with us). There is also
www.monohosting.net, but they appear to have shut down their Mono
offering for the time being.

If you have any questions, feel free to send me an email.
