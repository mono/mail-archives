<PRE>Jon...

Thanks for your reply...  Boy am I an idiot.  I am running this on Red =
Had
9, and only entering &quot;program.exe&quot;.  I'm so used to my Gentoo install, =
where
there is a startup script that registers mono exe's with the kernel, =
that I
forgot to do the &quot;mono program.exe&quot; thing.  I realize this when I tried =
to
run a simple Hello, World app.  Ok, p/invoke does work - at least for =
the
simple test app.  The test app calling the data provider, is hanging - =
but
that's going to take a little debugging to figure out.

Thanks
Tom

What platform are you running this on?  It looks like you have =
Windows-style
drives and paths, which suggests you're on Windows.

How are you executing the program?  Via &quot;mono program.exe&quot; or just
&quot;program.exe&quot;?

I suspect you're just doing &quot;program.exe&quot;, and you DO NOT have .NET
installed.  If this is the case, the reason is because .NET assemblies =
are
PE-formated object files, so Windows attempts to load the .exe as a =
normal
program.  One of the dependent libraries is mscorlib.dll, and if you =
don't
have .NET installed, (1) this library won't be found, and (2) the =
program
won't launch, which is what you're seeing.

Bottom line, I don't think  this is a P/Invoke issue, it's an =
installation
issue.

Fixes: install .NET, run your program as &quot;mono program.exe&quot;, or =
contribute
support to Mono so that Mono behaves like .NET on Windows (allowing you =
to
use &quot;program.exe&quot; to launch your app).

 - Jon
