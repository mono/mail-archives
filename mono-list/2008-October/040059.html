</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Working with mono winforms here at home currently requires (dual)
</I>&gt;<i> booting my workstation into Windows, modifying the winform, then
</I>&gt;<i> rebooting Linux to work with it in mono.  Then repeating the process
</I>&gt;<i> whenever any little changes are needed.  Rinse and repeat.
</I>I have writed some winform prj to run under linux, i'm undr MDV
2009.0, but Opensuse11.0 is also a good choice.
With your pkg manager, install virtualbox
After i start a new Machine/hdd throug Vbox, install XP on it + VS C# Express.
When i finish to work i close the Vbox windowse and say &quot;save stae&quot;
with keeping VS Open.
After , when i need i start again Vbox, it restore state and so i find
Vs open in the same state i stay it.
So i use WinXp+VS in exactly the same way as un normal software :-)
Bonus, Vbox have a virtual network/share :-)
Some of my WinForm Prj, running under nux can be found here :

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's why I stick my head up now and then, looking for a winform
</I>&gt;<i> designer that works in Linux.  Since mono 2.0 was released, I thought it
</I>&gt;<i> was time to look again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The idea of a GTK+ designer is interesting as well.  I plan to look into
</I>&gt;<i> that too, now that I know about it.
