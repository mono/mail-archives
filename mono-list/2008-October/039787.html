<PRE>
Hello,

I have an application written in .NET 2.0 and is working (to the best of my
knowledge) just fine on the Microsoft .NET platform. I am currently in the
process of testing my application with Mono (version 1.9.1 for Windows) and
have hit an interesting issue. My application only seems to run under Mono
if I leave the binary in the build directory. Moving the exe to another
location (say an installation location) seems to silently fail when launched
via mono.exe. This behavior is confusing, as my application does not do this
when ran under Microsoft's .NET. 

I have tried both debug and release builds, and that did not seem to change
anything. It is probably worth noting that my application has a GAC
dependency that is referenced dynamically at runtime, the program constructs
a new AppDomain and instantiates a class from the GACed assembly. I have
gone so far as to even copy the pdb files to the target directory, which
obviously had no effect.

I am at a loss for what is going on. If someone could at least point me in
the right direction that would be great. I would love to get my application
running under Mono.

Thanks,
Jason Whitehorn
