<PRE>
I'm kind of new :confused: to the whole idea of Mono, MonoDevelop and the
.Net (Got my biggest background on Java, JSP,Python and LAMP development)
but I think I got the grip quite fast...
 

Up to recently (5-6 months I guess) I got a job in this telephony company
which they use Visual Studio 2005 :-U with their projects in ASP, VB and C#. 

So.... as soon as I got home from Day-1 in my new job and back to my Ubuntu
Box :rules: I've logged into the Mono website to see what's the Linux side
was cooking for .Net

I made me a setup of MonoDevelop =) and YES it ROCKS!!  (The only thing that
it misses is a WYSIWYG for asp forms but... that's not much of a necessity I
guess.)

I prefer MonoDevelop than VS so much more that I even made a setup of
SharpDevelop :-p in my Windows box at my job and I've used it to port
projects that where passed over to me as well as the ones that I've started
from scratch.:working:

In SharpDevelop and MonoDevelop is so much easier and cleaner to do things
than VS. PLUS I've got cross platform compilation witch was a big issue at
my job because we have Unix and Linux based systems used for all kinds of
jobs and now we can develop front ends for Shell jobs and also our apps can
run on these systems as well. :drunk:

I believe Mono is one of the biggest things that happened in the development
community (not only for the Linux world but the entire development
community) .

Excellent Job :clap: dudes! Keep it Up and Keep It Open!! :-D
