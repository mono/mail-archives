Thanks for your comments.  Apparently there's a winform designer in the
works, although not quite ready for &quot;prime time&quot; yet.  Since I don't
program commercially for Linux, I can afford to wait for it to appear. 

Working with mono winforms here at home currently requires (dual)
booting my workstation into Windows, modifying the winform, then
rebooting Linux to work with it in mono.  Then repeating the process
whenever any little changes are needed.  Rinse and repeat.

That's why I stick my head up now and then, looking for a winform
designer that works in Linux.  Since mono 2.0 was released, I thought it
was time to look again.

The idea of a GTK+ designer is interesting as well.  I plan to look into
that too, now that I know about it.
