Dear Mono

We are experiencing a scenario where the number of running processes 
under mod_mono will ramp up quite fast from near zero to 60 or 70, then 
return to zero some time soon afterwards.

We suspect that we have something locking the processes, causing this 
behaviour, but can't find anything.

It would be extremely useful if mod_mono or xsp daemon could be queried 
in order to list the currently running process, by the external URL 
called to mod_mono.  Or maybe this can be done in the webservice c# code?

Can any user suggest how this might be done?

Kind regards,

Ben Clewett
