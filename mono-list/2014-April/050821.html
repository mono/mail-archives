<PRE>Hello Dave,

&gt;<i> Most distributions are slow at introducing updates to runtimes such as mono, python or java, and as a result, people have to package these runtimes themselves.  If there were official builds and repositories available for the opt-mono packages as you've done, I expect most would be very happy to use them.  They even run very well side by side with the mono included in various distributions by bootstrapping the application with environment variables set for the opt-mono packages.
</I>Yes, I don't want to get in conflict with the mono included in the
distribution, that could break software that depends on a certain
version of mono or has been certified for it. By providing the
/opt/mono/env.sh script the user can use the latest mono version when
it makes sense.

&gt;<i> IMHO you've done great work and it would be terrific if your builds and repositories could become official.  One thing that I would recommend it to ensure these packaged builds are tested, and possibly post the test results.  I feel like the biggest effort with an official distribution is that you are now the target for any questions or issues with the builds.
</I>Since I am only packaging the result of the build, the only valid
questions can be if some dependancy is missing or a bug in my
packaging.
Everything else should be the same as if you compile and install Mono manually.

&gt;<i> Have you been in contact with the mono-packagers-list to determine what the procedure is to make these official?
</I>I did not know about this mailing list. Unfortunately there is not
much traffic there, according to the archives.
I might post a copy of my original email there, just in case people
only read there and not here...

All the best,
Timotheus
</PRE>
