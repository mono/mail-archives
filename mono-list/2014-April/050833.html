</I>They've asked me to build this product, a stripped down version of a 
server based product built on an open source tool chain. One of their 
partners (a multi-national telematics firm) builds and sells the WinCE 
based solution and my client was presented with an opportunity to 
increase their sales through their partner's platform - they decided 
that was worth it, even recognizing the issues they might encounter with 
a dying platform.

I fully understand their desire not to use a windows tool chain - there 
are costs associate with that that are not present in a purely open 
source solution, not to mention being stuck using a tool (VS 2008) that 
is no longer commercially available. That said, Mono doesn't seem like 
it will be an alternative solution, as I expected, and that's fine. 
They'll just have to limp along until the current product dies its 
inevitable death and they can move on to a more robust platform.

Thanks for your feedback.
