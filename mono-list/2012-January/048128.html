</I>Yes and no. I'm trying to track down a bug(s) in some open source code 
that works under Windows but not Linux. It has a plugin architecture 
that loads/launches some external dlls (I also have the source for that 
and it too is C# code).

I didn't start with the 'soft debugger' because the website 
documentation said that was primarily for the iPhone which I do not have.

I have made some progress running under the 'soft debugger' 2.8.1, but 
have some questions:

1) How do I break on an exception? Normally under a debugger like gdb if 
an exception occurs it breaks. So far under this soft debugger, the 
program dies and the only notice is the backtrace in the 'Application 
Output' tab. It does not seem to be tied into the debugger at all.
2) How come sometimes I run an application and it does nothing? Is there 
some sort of cache or something? Sometimes it seems I need to run it 4 
or 5 times before it actually does anything.
3) There is one particular file called MainForm.cs. When I double click 
it under monodevelop is gives me an error 'could not opened. Failed to 
convert content from UTF-8 to UTF-8: Invalid byte sequence in conversion 
input.'. The file appears fine via 'vi' and the permissions are no 
different than the dozens of other files in that directory.

Thats all for now. Thanks.
