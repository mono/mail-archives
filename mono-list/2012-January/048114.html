<PRE>How easy that would be depends on your skills, naturally. You may be new to
Mono, but familiar with Java or other similar environments. What you're
trying to do sounds relatively easy. The way I understand it, you want to
generate a certain image depending on the value of some UI controls.

The first thing you'll have to do is pick a GUI Toolkit.
Your options are basically:

- Use WinForms. No install needed on Windows, but no designer with
MonoDevelop, and buggy on Linux and especially Mac. However, your app might
be simple enough that you could avoid getting into serious problems.

- Use GTK#. Install needed on Windows, but works better than WinForms across
platforms. Not as popular / used as WinForms in the .NET world, though, and
its future seems a bit uncertain.

- Use a different GUI toolkit depending on the OS. Most expensive solution,
but best results.

- Patiently wait for the upcoming GUI Toolkit by the Mono team: XWT. Won't
be available anytime soon, as it's not even been officially announced yet.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> More specifically, i would like to develp and application realted with

</I>&gt;<i> Firstly I would like to start by a desktop app then implement the same but

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A window, with a map, with some comboboxes and listboxes and possible tree
</I>&gt;<i> controls in order to show information and click on these rich controls and
</I>&gt;<i> update something on the map, for instance, centralize in the map the 
</I>&gt;<i> clicked object in the listbox
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please, could you advice me in terms of (easy) mono tools to do that?
