<PRE>My attempts to post to the list seem to be failing, so I apologise if 
this has appeared before.  It hasn't appeared in my mailbox:


OK.  I'm now trying to install monodevelop.

Here's what happens when I try from Red Carpet:

linux:~ # rug install monodevelop

Using monodevelop 0.7-3.novell from the 'Tools for mono' channel
The following requested packages will be installed:
 monodevelop 0.7-3.novell (Tools for mono)

The following additional packages will be installed:
 monodoc-core 1.0.7-0.novell (Tools for mono)
   monodoc-core-1.0.7-0.novell: needed by monodevelop-0.7-3.novell

2 packages will be installed.
This is a 8.96M download.
Do you want to continue? [y/N] y

There is no package signature for monodoc-core; package will be
installed because user is trusted

Can anyone help me out with what the next move ought to be.  Trying to
install monodoc on its own gives the same errors.

Cheers

Peter
