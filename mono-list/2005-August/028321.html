<PRE>I wonder if I could ask for some advice.

I have never really managed to get a completely satisfactory mono 
install with all the bits in place and everything working, and in a 
condition where it's updateable as well.  I currently have mono 1.1.7 
installed, but can't get monodevelop to work at all, and don't seem to 
be able to update via red carpet any more, for some reason.  I've not 
tried mod_mono yet, at all.

So I've decided to do a complete reinstall of SuSE Linux 9.3 on my Linux 
partition, in a week or so's time.  This will also give me the chance to 
create a FAT32 partition where I can share Windows and Linux files 
during development.

Could someone give me some advice on what I should install for a good 
mono installation?  For instance, should I install mono from the SuSE 
installation disks, or should I not do that but rather install mono via 
red carpet or something?

What should I do about Apache?  Should I install Apache2?  Should I do 
this before installing mono, or afterwards?  Should I install mod_mono 
from the SuSE disks, or via some other method?

I'm really determined to get it all working this time.  Any help that 
the list can give me will be very much appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Cheers


Peter
