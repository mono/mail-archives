<PRE>Steve,

&gt;<i> Since they're threads, I assume they're sharing their memory? The
</I>&gt;<i> configuration I'm experimenting with may require as many as 100 XSP
</I>&gt;<i> processes running concurrently.
</I>
The threads of a certain process are sharing their memory.
If you plan to provide mass hosting for XSP, then you'll end up
running as many XSP processes as you have configured using
AddMonoApplications alias1..n

&gt;<i> That's good to know... here's another - mod_mono would spawn XSP
</I>&gt;<i> servers using the Apache UID/GID, right? I'm trying to avoid that since
</I>&gt;<i> my company's customers are classically irresponsible with any type of
</I>&gt;<i> server-side scripting. (&quot;How come I can't delete my files over FTP? I
</I>&gt;<i> uploaded them with my aspx script!!!&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I've done is written a program that launches a separate XSP
</I>&gt;<i> process using the same UID/GID as is set by the suExecUserGroup
</I>&gt;<i> directive for each Apache virtual host. Also, the application roots are
</I>&gt;<i> set to the vhost document roots. This seems to keep the permissions in
</I>&gt;<i> line and perhaps adds some security, like using suexec. 
</I>
How did you achieve that? mod_mono's code is still running under
the apache user, even if you supplied suExecUserGroup. Apache's
suEXEC stuff  applies to CGI and SSI files only. That's the reason
why some PHP folks are using FastCGI for mass hosting.
