</I>&gt;<i>
</I>No.  I installed from the SuSE disks, then updated from Red Carpet, but 
it all went pear shaped.  I posted some stuff and had some help from 
this group at the time, but never got everything working (this included 
posting the command line output).  That's one of the reasons why I'm 
going for a clean reinstall

&gt;<i>Um, are you dual booting? If you're not, why bother with a FAT32
</I>&gt;<i>partition? Wouldn't SAMBA be a far more efficient solution?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I'm dual booting.  Also see below about what I'm trying to do.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I have a basic one: mono/mcs, monodevelop, monodoc, gtksharp,
</I>&gt;<i>libgdiplus, gtksourceview-sharp, gtkmozembed-sharp. To be honest, I very
</I>&gt;<i>rarely use monodevelop - emacs is far more usable IMO (but then I use
</I>&gt;<i>emacs over a IDE all the time)
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I'm not too worried about monodevelop, but I'd like to try it.  What I'm 
really interested in is testing/proving the cross-platform capabilities 
of mono, so I'll be doing things like developing in VS and then trying 
to run the result under mono.  That kind of thing.

&gt;&gt;<i>From source. I would *always* recommend from source unless the person
</I>&gt;<i>does not feel technically up to the task in which case, red carpet has
</I>&gt;<i>the most up to date versions (usually)
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Thanks

&gt;<i>that, let it do the install. It actually makes no difference if you
</I>&gt;<i>install Apache as part of the full install or after - it does make a
</I>&gt;<i>difference though if you want to install mod_mono as you need it at any
</I>&gt;<i>point *before* installing mod_mono. Again, choice is yours where to
</I>&gt;<i>install from, but I would suggest choosing one installer system (YaST or
</I>&gt;<i>RedCarpet for SuSE) and sticking to it.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I'm not sure I understood that, Paul.  Are you just saying that I need 
Apache before I can install mod_mono.  If so, then thanks, yes, I 
understand that.

&gt;<i>You just need to ask. If you want to go the sources route, then I'll
</I>&gt;<i>direct you to the fountain of all knowledge which the Mono people still
</I>&gt;<i>haven't established a link to but is hammered by new users!
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I'm grateful to you, Paul.  I'm going to try to pull together all the 
advice I get and then make a decision based on that.  If the first 
decision turns out to be a lemon, then I'll try the next, until I get it 
cracked.  I'm happy to invest some (of my own) time to get this sorted.

Cheers


Peter
