<PRE>There are two email lists that will help:
- mono-bugs 
- mono-patches
 
If you subscribe to these mail lists, you will be able to get email about a new bug or a change in a bug or its status.  Also, mono-patches will allow you to peer review others code.
 
Maybe a Pre-Release Days instead of Bug Day would be more appropriate for Mono.  We could help with docs, update status info on the mono wiki, test building the pre-release tarballs, test a pre-release of the installers, etc...  And of course, make sure any serious bugs are squashed so we can have an outstanding stable release.
 
However, any pre-release tarballs, RPMs, or installers would not be downloadable from the Downloads page.  Maybe only available as ftp and the word prerelease is in the tarball or installer's filename.
 
Just some ideas...
 
I'll be waiting to see your wiki page.

Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt;What needs to be done?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I think that putting the following couple of pages together on the Wiki :
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - General informations on bug days :
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * What is a bug day ?
</I>&gt;<i> * Who can attempt ?
</I>
This would need to be split and preferably, peer mentored. For example, user
&quot;a&quot; may write and compile some code which clearly shows (say) MWF is broken
for spot colours. This is submitted and a peer proofs the code to see that
it's not user &quot;a&quot; who has made a boo-boo before submitting as a real bug.

&gt;<i> * When does it take place ?
</I>
Logistically, the third is the biggest one given the diversity of places
people are (I'm in the UK for instance while Peter (say) is out by 6 hours
from GMT). I'd suggest that the bug &quot;day&quot; would need to be split into two half
days for when the developers are around.

&gt;<i> - Detailed informations on what to do during a bug day :
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This can be split in two parts : bug squashing and bug triaging :
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * As for bug triaging :
</I>&gt;<i> * How to find bug reports that are most important to triage ?
</I>&gt;<i> * How to triage a bug report ?
</I>
All bugs are important, just some more than others. I remember finding one
very small bug in an application called TechWriterPro (it's a RISC OS app)
which when investigated, proved to be massive and set back the release
schedule by a month.

&gt;<i> * As for bug squashing :
</I>&gt;<i> * How to find bug confirmed bug reports that are most important to fix ?
</I>&gt;<i> * How to fix a bug ?
</I>
Ideally, the developers, though others should never be discouraged. This is
were the peer review comes into it's own - bugs which aren't bugs never get
past the reviewer.

&gt;<i> along with an IRC channel and a mailing-list to announce special events 
</I>&gt;<i> (like special bug days before a release, etc.) could be a good step 
</I>&gt;<i> forward :-).
</I>
Definitely!

&gt;<i> What do you think about this ? I can give some time to help organize 
</I>&gt;<i> these bug squashing/triaging thing. I can write the wiki pages too .
</I>&gt;<i> However, I think we should discuss about conventions used by mono 
</I>&gt;<i> developers for the bugzilla system (like what version or milestone a bug 
</I>&gt;<i> report should be assigned to, etc.) before doing it.
</I>
Sounds a very good set of ideas. Would this bug day be best set on a saturday
or sunday though? Whatever happens, I'm happy to give over as much time as I
can. I am using mono more and more now (especially as it forms the basis of
some of my research project) - I can give back this way :-)
