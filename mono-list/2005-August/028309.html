<PRE>I have a server with a celeron 2.2 ghz, 512MB RAM and 80GB of server 
space. Running Debian sarge + Mono 1.1.7 and mod_mono 1.0.9 with Apache 
2.0.59

It serves 2 sites that together have aprox 80,000 page views per day.

Both sites are ASP.NET configured with their own mono_socket and wapi 
directories.  /( /tmp/VirtualHosts/site1/wapi etc. )/

The larger of the 2 sites averages at about 55,000 page views per day.

Today I tried to deploy Apache Lenya in Tomcat for another site, I 
effectively killed the server at that point. It worked for about 15 
minutes, then just stopped. The server was un-responsive until reboot.

My suspicion is that it ran out of ram and crashed, but it doesn't seem 
right.

So I'm asking, how much RAM do I really need for the 
mono/mod_mono/xsp/apache mix?

Add to that, does anyone know how I can use tools available on Linux to 
convert a mono/.NET assembly to a JAR compatible with tomcat. I've read 
about Mainsoft's Mainwin for J2EE. But it requires Visual Studio and 
Windows. I have neither (my XP died, so I'm all Linux now).

I also read about iNET from Stryon, but all their sites seem to be down. 
Including the chinese one. Suggestions? Anyone want to send me a copy of 
the Stryon command line prog? :)

Thanks.

Marc DM
