<PRE>I have installed mono on my hosted PHP web server.  The tech support
said they think someone has done it and that I could give it a try.  So
I'm doing this over SSH. 
 
I installed Mono two ways, with the bin, after I couldn't get that
working after a successful install, then compiling from source.  In both
cases, I had successful installs.  In both cases the command 'mcs' is
not found.  From what I can tell, there is an mcs in
mono-install-directory/bin/ but that points to the mcs.exe that is in
the mono-install-directory/lib/mono/1.0/.  Even in these directories, I
still get mcs: command not found. 
 
Am I doing something wrong?  Do I need root access in order to install
Mono.  I didn't think so.  I'm trying to set this up for ASP.NET, but I
can't even get Mono started, so I can't compile XSP, and I haven't even
tried mod-mono. 
 
Thanks for any help you can give me.  Remember, I don't have access to
this server beyond SSH.  Oh, it is running Redhat, that is all I know. 
 
Also, I have Mono running on my home Linux computer, so I have got it
running before, I just can't get it on the remote server.

Thanks,
Jeremy Vaught
