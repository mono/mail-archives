<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt;The above sounds like you've installed bits via redcarpet and bits from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;source. If you haven't, have you tried running monodevelop from the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;command line and see (and report!) the throwback from it? Also, what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;errors is redcarpet throwing back?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> No.  I installed from the SuSE disks, then updated from Red Carpet, but 
</I>&gt;<i> it all went pear shaped.  
</I>
How? I remember way back in my RH8 days that sometimes RC threw a
wobbler and knocked a few things out of joint, but never to the point of
being described as &quot;pear shaped&quot;

&gt;<i> &gt;Um, are you dual booting? If you're not, why bother with a FAT32
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;partition? Wouldn't SAMBA be a far more efficient solution?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> I'm dual booting.  Also see below about what I'm trying to do.
</I>
Okay

&gt;<i> &gt;I have a basic one: mono/mcs, monodevelop, monodoc, gtksharp,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;libgdiplus, gtksourceview-sharp, gtkmozembed-sharp. To be honest, I very
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;rarely use monodevelop - emacs is far more usable IMO (but then I use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;emacs over a IDE all the time)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not too worried about monodevelop, but I'd like to try it.  What I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> really interested in is testing/proving the cross-platform capabilities 
</I>&gt;<i> of mono, so I'll be doing things like developing in VS and then trying 
</I>&gt;<i> to run the result under mono.  That kind of thing.
</I>
Grab a copy of win4lin then - it's much easier than messing about with a
dual boot. I can tell you that there is a very high level of
cross-platform capabilities (I regularly post proof-of-concept material
to .NET users around Europe which works fine on their boxes - even if it
doesn't work on mine [mainly Managed.Windows.Forms stuff]). It is almost
getting to that point that I just say &quot;blow it, it'll work!&quot;

&gt;<i> &gt;that, let it do the install. It actually makes no difference if you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;install Apache as part of the full install or after - it does make a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;difference though if you want to install mod_mono as you need it at any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;point *before* installing mod_mono. Again, choice is yours where to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;install from, but I would suggest choosing one installer system (YaST or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;RedCarpet for SuSE) and sticking to it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure I understood that, Paul.  Are you just saying that I need 
</I>&gt;<i> Apache before I can install mod_mono.  If so, then thanks, yes, I 
</I>&gt;<i> understand that.
</I>
You need apache-devel to install mod_mono and apache-devel usually needs
apache before being able to install.

&gt;<i> &gt;You just need to ask. If you want to go the sources route, then I'll
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;direct you to the fountain of all knowledge which the Mono people still
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;haven't established a link to but is hammered by new users!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> I'm grateful to you, Paul.  I'm going to try to pull together all the 
</I>&gt;<i> advice I get and then make a decision based on that.  If the first 
</I>&gt;<i> decision turns out to be a lemon, then I'll try the next, until I get it 
</I>&gt;<i> cracked.  I'm happy to invest some (of my own) time to get this sorted.
</I>
Not a problem :-)

TTFN

Paul
