<PRE>Gee, tl, are you sure you want your clients to go through all that
re-training and dealing with the (temporary) productivity loss while
everyone gets acclimated to the new desktop?  Not to mention all the
documentation issues, lots of new configuration file changes, etc.,
that you'll need to deal with.  Why not just stick with KDE?

If you are concerned about being able to integrate your mono
applications smoothly with qt-based interfaces, I would be glad to
offer my services as a technical specialist and programmer to ensure
your users won't have to deal with functionality gaps and kludgy
interfaces to stay with your current environment :-)

[sorry if this is a little off-topic]
