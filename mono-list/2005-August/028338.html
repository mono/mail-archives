</I>Ben,

OK.  Stick with me on this.  I'm very much in the user category here.  
I've been a Linux user for many years - but never a developer.  My 
employment is as a developer using .NET on the Windows platform.  So I'm 
a bit unfamiliar with some of the concepts here.

However, spurred on by your reply, I did this:

linux:/home/peter # rug update mono-1.1-official

'mono-1.1-official' matches 'Mono 1.1.x'
The following requested packages will be installed:
  bytefx-data-mysql 1.1.8.3-0.novell (Mono 1.1.x)
  ibm-data-db2 1.1.8.3-0.novell (Mono 1.1.x)

The following additional packages will be installed:

    mono-nunit-1.1.8.3-0.novell: needed by mono-complete-1.1.8.3-0.novell

The following packages must be REMOVED

So have I just lost one package (mono-data-sqlite?) or did I lose some 
more as well?  Without going through each package in detail, it seems 
that there were 20 to install, but only 13 made it.  What do I have to 
do to recover?

I'll try the other channels and post any interesting results.

But thanks for spurring me on to have another go.  I don't really want 
to overwrite my system if I can help it.

Cheers

Peter
