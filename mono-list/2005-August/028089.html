<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Since I am doing everything now in mono/gtk# on Linux (for these
</I>&gt;<i>  clients), (now) and  in time want to have the most optimum desktop
</I>&gt;<i>  environment for these people, is it correct to say I should obviously
</I>&gt;<i>  be switching to Gnome based on the Mono project direction? 
</I>
If your main developer platform will be Mono, GNOME is the preferred
desktop.  Your software will certainly work with KDE and any other
desktop environments, but we strive to integrate with GNOME.

&gt;<i> Is there perhaps maybe a bit of hidden politics at work here too?
</I>&gt;<i> but I find it odd ... Novell bought SUSE, Novell funds mono (to some extent),
</I>&gt;<i> suse distro's default to KDE do they not? (pretty sure 9.0/9.1/9.2 do)?
</I>&gt;<i> Since we see Novell funding mono, owning SUSE, and talk of how tight
</I>&gt;<i> Gnome and mono may become .... what is the outlook/piture of KDE in the future.
</I>
The Mono development stack is completely free, and we try to keep it
that way.  We do not integrate into Mono any libraries that would
require you to license third party technologies.  For this reason we
give preference to Gtk+ libraries.

We also have to focus our energies in a single direction, and that
direction is Gtk#

Miguel.
</PRE>
