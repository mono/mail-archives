<PRE>Since they're threads, I assume they're sharing their memory? The
configuration I'm experimenting with may require as many as 100 XSP
processes running concurrently.

&gt;<i> With mod_mono you can limit the CPU and memory usage of
</I>&gt;<i> the mono process. This is far better then limiting the max thread
</I>&gt;<i> count. Have a look at MonoMaxCPUTime and MonoMaxMemory from
</I>&gt;<i> mod_mono's man page.
</I>
That's good to know... here's another - mod_mono would spawn XSP
servers using the Apache UID/GID, right? I'm trying to avoid that since
my company's customers are classically irresponsible with any type of
server-side scripting. (&quot;How come I can't delete my files over FTP? I
uploaded them with my aspx script!!!&quot;)


What I've done is written a program that launches a separate XSP
process using the same UID/GID as is set by the suExecUserGroup
directive for each Apache virtual host. Also, the application roots are
set to the vhost document roots. This seems to keep the permissions in
line and perhaps adds some security, like using suexec. 


Granted, This server is in the experimentation phase of it's design, so
I'm not certain how feasible it really is. We're only planning to do
load testing after we get Sun's ASP working as well. Is anyone else out
there working along the same lines? At this point, staying on a *nix
platform is pretty much required because of our customized service
config system (also in development).
