<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; For instance, should I install mono from the SuSE 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; installation disks, or should I not do that but rather install mono via 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; red carpet or something?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;From source. I would *always* recommend from source unless the person
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; does not feel technically up to the task in which case,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Uhm, what issues have you found with your packages? I know that we
</I>&gt;<i> aren't able to support gtk# on a distro the day it comes out. 
</I>
I think it slightly more that &quot;a day&quot; when FC1 and FC2 came out. If
memory servers me right, there was even talk of it not being supported!

&gt;<i> But for
</I>&gt;<i> mono itself our packages should work flawlessly. OTOH, compiling takes a
</I>&gt;<i> bit of time and is error prone.
</I>
Yep. I'll agree with that. Hmmm, how long have I been compiling mono
from source now?

&gt;<i> &gt; red carpet has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the most up to date versions (usually)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Red Carpet will *always* have the same version as the downloads page
</I>&gt;<i> has. We were bad about this before the spring when I revamped our build
</I>&gt;<i> system. It should always be up to date now.
</I>
Shows how long it's been since I've used it ;-)

TTFN

Paul
