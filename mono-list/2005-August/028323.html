<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I have never really managed to get a completely satisfactory mono 
</I>&gt;<i> install with all the bits in place and everything working, and in a 
</I>&gt;<i> condition where it's updateable as well.  I currently have mono 1.1.7 
</I>&gt;<i> installed, but can't get monodevelop to work at all, and don't seem to 
</I>&gt;<i> be able to update via red carpet any more, for some reason.  I've not 
</I>&gt;<i> tried mod_mono yet, at all.
</I>
The above sounds like you've installed bits via redcarpet and bits from
source. If you haven't, have you tried running monodevelop from the
command line and see (and report!) the throwback from it? Also, what
errors is redcarpet throwing back?

&gt;<i> So I've decided to do a complete reinstall of SuSE Linux 9.3 on my Linux 
</I>&gt;<i> partition, in a week or so's time.  This will also give me the chance to 
</I>&gt;<i> create a FAT32 partition where I can share Windows and Linux files 
</I>&gt;<i> during development.
</I>
Um, are you dual booting? If you're not, why bother with a FAT32
partition? Wouldn't SAMBA be a far more efficient solution?

&gt;<i> Could someone give me some advice on what I should install for a good 
</I>&gt;<i> mono installation?  
</I>
I have a basic one: mono/mcs, monodevelop, monodoc, gtksharp,
libgdiplus, gtksourceview-sharp, gtkmozembed-sharp. To be honest, I very
rarely use monodevelop - emacs is far more usable IMO (but then I use
emacs over a IDE all the time)

&gt;<i> For instance, should I install mono from the SuSE 
</I>&gt;<i> installation disks, or should I not do that but rather install mono via 
</I>&gt;<i> red carpet or something?
</I>
&gt;<i>From source. I would *always* recommend from source unless the person
</I>does not feel technically up to the task in which case, red carpet has
the most up to date versions (usually)

&gt;<i> What should I do about Apache?  Should I install Apache2?  
</I>
Go with which ever version your distro has. I think they're all on
Apache2 now. You will need the Apache-devel files as well.

&gt;<i> Should I do 
</I>&gt;<i> this before installing mono, or afterwards?  Should I install mod_mono 
</I>&gt;<i> from the SuSE disks, or via some other method?
</I>
When you install from a set of distro discs, choose what you need from
that, let it do the install. It actually makes no difference if you
install Apache as part of the full install or after - it does make a
difference though if you want to install mod_mono as you need it at any
point *before* installing mod_mono. Again, choice is yours where to
install from, but I would suggest choosing one installer system (YaST or
RedCarpet for SuSE) and sticking to it.

&gt;<i> I'm really determined to get it all working this time.  Any help that 
</I>&gt;<i> the list can give me will be very much appreciated.
</I>
You just need to ask. If you want to go the sources route, then I'll
direct you to the fountain of all knowledge which the Mono people still
haven't established a link to but is hammered by new users!

TTFN
