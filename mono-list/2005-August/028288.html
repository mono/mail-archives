<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt;What needs to be done?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I think that putting  the following couple of pages together on the Wiki  :
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - General informations on bug days :
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  * What is a bug day ?
</I>&gt;<i>  * Who can attempt ?
</I>
This would need to be split and preferably, peer mentored. For example, user
&quot;a&quot; may write and compile some code which clearly shows (say) MWF is broken
for spot colours. This is submitted and a peer proofs the code to see that
it's not user &quot;a&quot; who has made a boo-boo before submitting as a real bug.

&gt;<i>  * When does it take place ?
</I>
Logistically, the third is the biggest one given the diversity of places
people are (I'm in the UK for instance while Peter (say) is out by 6 hours
from GMT). I'd suggest that the bug &quot;day&quot; would need to be split into two half
days for when the developers are around.
 
&gt;<i> -  Detailed informations on what to do during a bug day :
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This can be split in two parts : bug squashing and bug triaging :
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  * As for bug triaging :
</I>&gt;<i>   * How to find bug reports that are most important to triage ?
</I>&gt;<i>   * How to triage a bug report ?
</I>
All bugs are important, just some more than others. I remember finding one
very small bug in an application called TechWriterPro (it's a RISC OS app)
which when investigated, proved to be massive and set back the release
schedule by a month.
 
&gt;<i> * As for bug squashing :
</I>&gt;<i>  * How to find bug confirmed bug reports that are most important to fix ?
</I>&gt;<i>  * How to fix a bug ?
</I>
Ideally, the developers, though others should never be discouraged. This is
were the peer review comes into it's own - bugs which aren't bugs never get
past the reviewer.
 
&gt;<i> along with an IRC channel and a mailing-list to announce special events 
</I>&gt;<i> (like special bug days before a release, etc.) could be a good step 
</I>&gt;<i> forward :-).
</I>
Definitely!
 
&gt;<i> What do you think about this ? I can give some time to help organize 
</I>&gt;<i> these bug squashing/triaging thing. I can write the wiki pages too .
</I>&gt;<i> However, I think we should discuss about conventions used by mono 
</I>&gt;<i> developers for the bugzilla system (like what version or milestone a bug 
</I>&gt;<i> report should be assigned to, etc.) before doing it.
</I>
Sounds a very good set of ideas. Would this bug day be best set on a saturday
or sunday though? Whatever happens, I'm happy to give over as much time as I
can. I am using mono more and more now (especially as it forms the basis of
some of my research project) - I can give back this way :-)

TTFN
