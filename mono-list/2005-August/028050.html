<PRE>I have just recently run in to a gtk-sharp issue on
a kde desktop. Went to gnome on the same machine, and all is fine.

It just got me thinking ..
I don't really have a preference to either desk top, i just have been running
KDE for years and years because it probably came up stock on an old distro.

I see obviously direct support for gnome in the mono project, and of course
gtk# appears to be where its at right now for gui with mono apps.

That having been said .. I am about to roll out some mono/gtk# apps
to a pool of about 1000 people working for various fortune 500 companies in
US and fortune 50 companies in Canada.

and I pick the desktop they run, and until now that is KDE.

Since I am doing everything now in mono/gtk# on Linux (for these clients),
(now) and  in time want to have the most optimum desktop environment
for these people,
is it correct to say I should obviously be switching to Gnome
based on the Mono project direction? 

If anyone were to guess..what percentage of mono lead developers/maintainers
use gnome  vs. kde?

As far as I gather, mono/gtk# app. will work fine on both desktops
but with gnome there will be synergy amongst apps (i.e. drag on to)
that KDE will not have? And if this is the case, anyone thought about
that type of support for KDE?

Is there perhaps maybe a bit of hidden politics at work here too?
but I find it odd ... Novell bought SUSE, Novell funds mono (to some extent),
suse distro's default to KDE do they not? (pretty sure 9.0/9.1/9.2 do)?
Since we see Novell funding mono, owning SUSE, and talk of how tight
Gnome and mono may become .... what is the outlook/piture of KDE in the future.

Looks like I am switching to Gnome unless my hunch (post) is completely
off base.
