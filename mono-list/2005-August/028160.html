<PRE>I think I fixed my problem. This is going to sound strange, and I cannot 
explain exactly why this behavior occurred. I just hope that it helps someone 
who is searching the archives. I upgraded my system from Athlon to Athlon64 
recently, moving from i585 SUSE to x86_64. I installed mono-1.1.8.3 from the 
source tarball. The mono process would just freeze when I tried to use it. 
However, I remembered that my SUSE 9.3 DVD had a copy of mono on it, and it 
worked fine. I then used the SUSE 9.3 DVD version to build recent CVS version 
of Mono. But when I tried to the recent CVS (after installing it and removing 
Mono RPM from SUSE 9.3), it would freeze, too. Finally, I had a thought that 
maybe I needed to remove ~/.wapi. It was just a hunch. Apparently, that fixed 
my problems. I had kept /home when I upgraded and reinstalled SUSE, and 
apparently, some newer versions of Mono do not like having the old ~/.wapi 
around. I guess that's why the SUSE 9.3 RPM worked all right, but I'm not 
really sure.
