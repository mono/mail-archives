If you have issues doing that, 99% mono and gtk-sharp is not involved
at all. You should likely file a bug report with the kde folks
describing the issue (or in alternative with the gtk+ people).

</I>
My guess is that it would be better for your users to switch to Gnome,
if you provide Gtk+/Gnome apps, because they will be more consistent
with the rest of the desktop.

&gt;<i> that KDE will not have? And if this is the case, anyone thought about
</I>&gt;<i> that type of support for KDE?
</I>
If both kde and gnome/gtk+ follow the commonly defined desktop
interoperability standards, there should be no problem. As you see mono
is not involved at all in this.

&gt;<i> Is there perhaps maybe a bit of hidden politics at work here too?

Is there perhaps maybe a bit of hidden paranoia at work here too?

&gt;<i> Gnome and mono may become .... what is the outlook/piture of KDE in the future.
</I>
mono doesn't need to provide any kde-specific compatibility in the same
way that it doesn't provide any gnome-specific compatibility. The only
difference is that many Gtk+/Gnome developers decided to write apps
using mono, while kde developers didn't. As for the reason, you should
ask them. If someone would write a kde C# binding or whatever, they'd
get the same kind of support we give to any other open source project
that uses mono.
