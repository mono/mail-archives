<PRE>Hello John,

I'm afraid I can't say much more than what's already in the FAQ...

On Fri, 2005-19-08 at 16:53 -0400, John M. Brown wrote:
&gt;<i> I continually get this error when I try to use the System.Net.WebRequest

&gt;<i> I ran the tlstest.exe file from: <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/FAQ:_Security">http://www.mono-project.com/FAQ:_Security</A>
</I>&gt;<i> and it gives me some data but the last line reads:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Error #-2146762486: CERT_E_CHAINING 0x800B010A&quot;
</I>
That's because there's no way to verify the authenticity of the server's
certificate (i.e. can't build a chain up to a trusted root).

&gt;<i> I read in a mailing in June that I may be able to get around this by
</I>&gt;<i> trusting the certificate, but alas the FAQ page doesn't provide much in
</I>&gt;<i> the way of details except to say &quot;you need to find the public
</I>&gt;<i> certificate&quot;.
</I>
There's no central site where you can find all existing roots (not that
it would be a good idea) so it's not easy to give details (i.e. finding
them will vary by CA).

&gt;<i> Can anyone provide a work around or tell me what I'm doing wrong... or
</I>&gt;<i> even give me some direction in how to set up trust against either an
</I>&gt;<i> individual 
</I>
Using a web browser try to look for the site certificate, find which CA
has signed it, then go to their site, download their root certs and
install them using certmgr.exe

&gt;<i> or blanketed trust to all certificates?
</I>
I don't recommend that option but you can, as stated in the FAQ,
implement an ICertificatePolicy class. Look at the tlstest source code
to see how this is done.

&gt;<i> Let me repeat again for clarity.  My program works correctly on
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft's .Net CLR on Windows, but fails when run through Mono.
</I>
That's because the required root certificates are present in Windows.

&gt;<i>   The
</I>&gt;<i> site I'm connecting to for an example is <A HREF="https://www.ipupdater.com">https://www.ipupdater.com</A>
</I>
A look at their SSL certificate shows that it was issued by
&quot;Comodo Class 3 Security Services CA&quot;, so Comodo is your best place to
start a search - and in fact you can find it there (it's not easy but
it's there).

<A HREF="http://www.instantssl.com/ssl-certificate-support/cert_installation/ssl-certificate-index.html?currency=USD&amp;region=North%20America&amp;country=CA">http://www.instantssl.com/ssl-certificate-support/cert_installation/ssl-certificate-index.html?currency=USD&amp;region=North%20America&amp;country=CA</A>

If it wasn't then you would need to look a little more, Comodo CA is not
a root and it's ICA certificate was issued by &quot;GTE CyberTrust Root&quot;*,
which was buy by Baltimore, which was buy by Betrusted, which was
renamed Cybertrust.

* yes that means that you must install both the Comodo (intermediate)
and the GTE (root) certificates for it to work.
