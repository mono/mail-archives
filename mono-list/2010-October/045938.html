It should be noted that native code is no solution either; it's quite
possible to reverse engineer native assembly code, and there are a
number of commercial tools which greatly simplify the process.
(Granted, it's not quite as easy as with IL &amp; Reflector, but it's not
significantly more difficult for those who *really* want to understand
your app, either.)

&gt;<i> It's not that I'm a paranoid, thinking the entire world is going to

</I>
Again, native code would have the same problems, and the solutions are
largely the same:

  - embed a file hash of the program into the program and verify that
    the hash is correct during app startup
  - Encrypt parts of the program and use some private key to unencrypt
    those bits
  - Move the *really* important bits to a server, and require network 
    use
  - ...

It should be noted that all of these (and more!) have been used for e.g.
copyright protection/copy prevention...and all have largely failed, when
enough people wanted to bypass it.  (See also CSS and ~every music
encryption scheme known to man.  And XBox360/PS3 app startup. And...)

The only reasonably surefire approach is requiring use of a server, and
even that has been bypassed (in game copy protection systems, by hosting
a secondary server).

(Remember, most of the above systems did NOT have source available, and
yet they were still broken.  Native code will at best slow down
attackers.)

So really, you can either hope for being infrequently used enough to not
draw the ire of those who break these systems for fun, try to play
cat-and-mouse with the inevitable &quot;breaks&quot;, or to just give up and sue
anyone you later find to be copying your program.
