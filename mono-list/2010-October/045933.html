<PRE>Hi,

I have a project that I am trying to build on Mono-2.8 but it is
erroring out with the following message:
error CS1574: XML comment on 'full method name here' has cref
attribute 'System.String' that could not be resolved

I've read up on CS1574 and it says that this error occurs because the
cref attribute can't be found.  But this is System.String, shouldn't
this be automatic?  Also, this project builds as is without issues on
Mono-2.6 and .NET.  Did something change between 2.6 and 2.8 that
could cause this error to appear?

Please let me know if there are any questions.

Thanks,
Ryan
</PRE>
