<PRE>I have looked at stuff, on IRC chat someone told me lot of porting is
required but I would think its better I start with fixing some bug or maybe
complete a class library, I saw that a few functions needed to be complete.

If someone on the mailing-list needs something specific please let me know.

If not I would I like to work on the runtime implementation of things, I
also saw the some work is been going on the JIT complier. I will be around
for a while looking to find something to start with.

Incase anyone has something specific in mind or would like to collaborate to
get some work done. I am geared up.


@Stifu- Thanks for the links, I will look into it and get back to you guys
if I need to ask more questions. (Sorry I replied to you personally by
mistake)
