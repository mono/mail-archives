Hello,
Thanks both for your answers. 

Actually, copy protection is not what I worry about, I know that no licensing system is 100% safe and I totally agree when you say that people will find a way to bypass them if they really invest time in it.
What I want to protect the most is the algorithms used in the application, they represent many years of research and development and we don't want them to fall into the hands of a competitor who is just running an IL disassembler.

Trying to reverse-engineer native code using a debugger is a real pain when it comes to complex operations. I'm personally convinced that it would be a complete waste of time on this kind of software. 
Unfortunately, from what I can tell, mono aot compiler works by generating a dll/so file next to the &quot;.exe&quot; assembly, it seems that shipping this IL assembly is still required to start the application. You just avoid using JIT compilation... or did I miss something?

I'm still looking for a solution...
