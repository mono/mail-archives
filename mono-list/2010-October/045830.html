<PRE>Hello fellow programmers,

I am new to the Mono mailing lists. I have been a self motivated Linux
programmer and user since 3 years and I am a .NET developer in my
profession.

I have had an idea about MONO for quiet sometime now and its in my mind that
I should contribute whatever I can over here.ITs only now that I could
materialise it and so I am writing to the mailing-list.

Ximian took a great step by stepping forward with this idea and under Novell
now as I hear it still grows well. I have browsed throguh some of the code
and documentation. I see lots of Library implementation also needs work and
there is lots to do and I would like to get started.

Due to my tight schedule I would like someone to guide me into areas and
work that needs to be done.

I would highly appreciate if u guys out there could invite me in to get me
started.

Thanks,
Abhishek
