<PRE>I wonder if Microsoft announcing that c# for windows phone 7
development will be free with have any impact.

Previously Windows Mobile development required visual studio pro which
was quite pricey.

Problems with GPL code in the app store and the closed nature of the
iphone ecosystem meant a paid MonoTouch model makes sense.

For the open android system, with no GPL restrictions built on the
open source linux kernel and ecosystem a paid model does not make as
much sense.

It does make sense for companies trying to leverage existing code
bases, Compared to the cost of rewriting these in java the MonoDroid
license is cheap.

For people not trying to make money, for people just experimenting in
their own time, or people trying to produce free and open source
software in order to solve a problem or give back to the community
then a paid MonoDroid is not really an option.

It seems to me that these are two quite different users with different
needs. A free license for use in non commercial applications or
projects or a separate product for FOSS development would be nice.

But as far as I can tell a pricing structure has not yet been
officially announced, So I guess we just have to sit back and wait to
see what happens.

Cheers,
Daniel Hughes
