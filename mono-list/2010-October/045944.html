Again, if possible you could move this code to be server-side.
Otherwise you're at best delaying things.  That said...

This is incorrect.  Actual IL should not be required for AOT invocation
(or full-AOT invocation, I forget which; you may need full AOT).  Thus,
after generating your (full-)AOT .so files, it should be possible to
&quot;strip&quot; the IL in your assemblies, leaving only type and member
declarations but no method IL.  I'm fairly sure such tools already
exist, though I can't think of anything offhand.

As mentioned earlier, this will &quot;kill&quot; portability to different ABIs,
but that may not be very important for your use case.
