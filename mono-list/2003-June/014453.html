<PRE>Why on earth would you want to dynamically generate the status pages on
the server? Are you expecting something to change in the assmeblies
between page loads? The only time it makes sense to update the pages is
after you've built the assemblies.

Besides: your assumption that the HTML is smaller thatn the XML is in
correct. Check the sizes, there's much more information in the
corcompare-generated XML files than are presented in the HTML.

Can you explain what &quot;doubling back&quot; means in the context of an XSTL
tranform?
