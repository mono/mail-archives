</I>I talked with Miguel about this. He said to me that he does not mind the
booting into windows part as much as he minds the requirement to
transfer stuff between Linux and Windows.

&gt;<i> &gt; But since the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transform is taking place on the server, I don't want to take up gobs of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unnecessary CPU time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And the best way to avoid that is to do the transform offline: very
</I>&gt;<i> simple, very effective, very reliable and very fast.
</I>Right now, we generate *all* of our content statically. So using your
argument we don't even need an asp.net site.
