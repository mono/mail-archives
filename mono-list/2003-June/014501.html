<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Rien a faire...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've checked out Mono from CVS and reinstalled from scratch,
</I>&gt;<i> but when trying to compile NAnt, I always get the following
</I>&gt;<i> error messages:
</I>
Hmm... it is curious that you made it well on Gentoo, but couldn't build
on Redhat9. I guess each of them might be incorrect ;-)

&gt;<i> Have you tried to check out NAnt and compile it?
</I>
I've been trying nant-20030621. I have no problem to build it (with some
customization), but could not succeed to use it, because of some config
stuff (it seems undocumented as yet...). As to mcs-included nant
(mcs/nant), I could build, and it reads .build file well (though I
couldn't make all good).

I'll report if I could find the reason.

Thanks,
  Atsushi Eno
