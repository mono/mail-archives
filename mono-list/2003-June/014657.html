Hi,

first of all IMHO parentheses do DECREASE general code readibility in =
that case. Look at the following lines and judge for yourself:

DisplaySize =3D Me.GetMinimumSize ().ToPointF ().X.ToString ().Length

DisplaySize =3D Me.GetMinimumSize.ToPointF.X.ToString.Length

In 99.9% of all possibilities it doesn't matter if I'm calling an =
expression or statement (and you don't need and want to know). And don't =
forget that you don't use parenthesis for properties either (which are =
internally just method calls).
There is another major point. If we remove that about 95% or all VB.Net =
code that exists on the net will not compile with MBas (just check the =
user contriubutions at gotdotnet). That means mbas will not be a =
superset of VB.Net as is says but a subset.=20
You are correct that they generally don't hurt. They don't hurt if =
someone WANTS to use them, and they can (and should) use them, but if =
somebody doesn't want to, then there is no reason to FORCE him to do. =
Thats the main aspect of VB.Net and one of the main differences to C#: =
In VB.Net there is always more than one way to do something. And while =
this is the curse of VB it's also it's biggest advantage.
If you really like the compiler to check that then add a compiler option =
that you can turn on (and is off by default) and that checks for empty =
parenthesis.

Original:
No, it's no good thing at all, IMO. Parentheses increase the readability
of code with no hurt at all, by simply distinguishing between an
expression and a statement.
