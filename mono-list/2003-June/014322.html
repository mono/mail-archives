</I>Jackson,

I really think Ximian should be picking up the tab for this ;-). There
is no reason that a private investor should be paying for this
(especially since Ximian uses a lot of bandwidth anyways--a gig of
monocharges is like having 5 people download XD2, something which I am
sure they would be happy to have).

As well, I would very much like to see the files be on the official
Ximian site for other reasons. Someday, I think we should provide a
script that will build Mono from scratch on a reasonably well set up
computer (sort of like go.ximian.com), and I think that having
monocharge-mini on the official site would be a big part of this.
Anyways, Ximian probably has bigger pipes than got-mono ;-).

Another idea is to just keep the most modern monocharge-mini on CVS. I
actually *really* like this solution for a few reasons:
     1. Lets say someone breaks stuff one day after a new corlib
        compatibility thing. If I cvs update -D&quot;48 hours ago&quot;, I will
        get the *correct* monocharge.
     2. The normal parties pick up the tab for bandwidth.

Miguel? What do you think of this?
