<PRE>Hi,

I've been trying for days to build mono. Now it's time I speak :-)

I am following the README.building in mcs/, as Gonzalo suggested many
times.

apt-get remove mono-assemblies

cvs -z5 update mono
cvs -z5 update mcs

  (now i have got the mono and mcs directories, side by side).

cd mono/doc

./mono-build.sh

This doesn't work. I get many error messages:

It seems this batch expects the dlls from mcs. Which obviously aren't
there, since README.building says I must start in the mono directory!

 I'm getting crazy :-)

Please help
