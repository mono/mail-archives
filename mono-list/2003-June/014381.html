As I understand it, one of the main reasons why a GAC has not yet been
implemented for Mono is because of the 'instability' in all the
assemblies that we ship.

We have dozens of changes made to every single assembly everyday. If we
enforce a GAC on everyone, then each change made to the assembly would
require a re-signing process, bump the version count, etc etc. That is
simply not feasible for the pace of development at this moment.

Rest assured a GAC should not be difficult to implement at all. When our
libraries have reached a level of stability that we can feel confident,
then a GAC will be implemented.

Duncan.
