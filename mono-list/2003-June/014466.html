<PRE>I think the point is that there is a line that you draw with regards to
dynamically generated content. You wouldn't pull an image from a
database, it doesn't make sense. There is a point where the cost exceeds
the gain.

If you have to boot into windows to get a new xml file regardless, your
source data is not going to change that often. And it definitely will
not change without you knowing it. Given this, it makes much more sense
to statically generate that page, or at most send the XML/XSLT to
capable clients. There is too much overhead for too little (if any) gain
to contemplate rendering it dynamically, even if it is cached.

Forums should be dynamic... Content is added randomly.
News feeds should be dynamic, the content is added to frequently.
eBusiness sites should be dynamic, the prices need to be centralized.
Corlib comparisons? Let's face it, the corlib doesn't change often
enough to warrant being dynamic.

Just my $0.02

</I>I talked with Miguel about this. He said to me that he does not mind the
booting into windows part as much as he minds the requirement to
transfer stuff between Linux and Windows.

&gt;<i> &gt; But since the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transform is taking place on the server, I don't want to take up

&gt;<i> &gt; unnecessary CPU time.
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> And the best way to avoid that is to do the transform offline: very
</I>&gt;<i> simple, very effective, very reliable and very fast.
</I>Right now, we generate *all* of our content statically. So using your
argument we don't even need an asp.net site.
