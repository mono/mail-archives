Yes, this is normal, as you still don't have the assemblies built.

&gt;<i> I'll run through it from scratch tomorrow so I can post an error log

I didn't try it right now, but I think so.

Steve, after you get the Mono built, it will create a directory called 
install and inside it, there is the bin and lib dirs. Put the .dll from 
monocharge in the dll dir and mcs.exe in the bin dir. There will be a 
mcs script in the bin folder which calls the mcs.exe. It is created for 
your based in your current install path. If it is not created, you can 
create one which does the following:

/&lt;path-to-your-mono-install&gt;/bin/mono 
/&lt;path-to-your-mono-install&gt;/bin/mcs.exe

This all in one line.

Now add bin and lib path to you PATH environment variable and just exec 
mono and so mcs. It should work. :)

I hope it helps.
