If it's not in your plan it's too bad, though I don't see what relevance
your plans have to do with the mono website. The way things work in mono
and any other free software project is:
*) someone does the work
*) the work is better than the current one (for many meanings of
better: faster, more maintainable, more complaint to the spec...)

As the work is not done and if it will generate dynamically pages that
should definitely be static it's clearly worse, guess what we'll 
do with it.

All of your suggestions can be applied to the current xml spit out by
the current tool, now you're just coming up with excuses.

&gt;<i> &gt; Besides, if Ben has suggestions, he can well make them on the list.
</I>&gt;<i> Well, basically, my suggestion is to make it so that the output of tool
</I>&gt;<i> can be parsed in one forward only pass. One of the problems with XSLT
</I>
Since this happens offline, it's not important. And if you want to do it
in a different way, you can preprocess the xml file anyway. Bottom line
is: a little working code works best than a thousand suggestions.
