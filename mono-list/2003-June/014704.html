<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> I understand, but this means that I won't be able to distribute a single
</I>&gt;<i> assembly for both Mono and .NET.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It doesn't bother me that these methods are not implemented, as in our
</I>&gt;<i> case (log4net) that just means that the EventLogAppender doesn't work on
</I>&gt;<i> Mono.  Which is something we can document in the docs and release notes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's a pity that we're not able to distribute a single assembly for both
</I>&gt;<i> Mono and .NET because of this, but again, I understand.
</I>
I understand this is an issue.  We could change it to throw an
exception, but my guess is that you would not like that either, right?

What about contributing a simple-minded EventLog implementation?

Miguel
