<PRE>Hi all,
it's a great pleasure to say Npgsql has a new release!

 From Release Notes:

Npgsql 0.5 development release.
What's new in this version:
- New datatypes supported: bool, int2, int4, int8, numeric, timestamp, 
date, time and text data types.
These types are mapped to DbTtype enum: Boolean, Int16, Int32, Int64, 
Decimal, DateTime, Date, Time and String.
- NpgsqlParameter now supports those types through the DbType 
enumeration and not just Int32, Int64
- NpgsqlDataAdapter now has more helper contructors. Thanks stevenao for 
reporting this (Bug 455)
- MD5 Authentication is now supported. Thanks Brar Piening.
Mono MD5 implementation is being used. Thanks Sebastien Pouliot.
- NpgsqlDataAdapter can be used to select, insert, update and delete 
data with DataSets.
- StrongType datasets generated with xsd can be used.
- Support for Listen/Notify events through the NotificationEventHandler 
delegate and NpgsqlConnection.OnNotification event. Thanks Wojtek 
Wierzbicki. Now applications can hook on it to receive notification 
messages from server. This notification is asynchronous which means they 
will be delivered to client apps in the next interaction of Npgsql with 
backend.
- NUnit20 tests were added. There are 48 tests which can also be used as 
a source of references of new Npgsql functionality. Of course, new tests 
are very welcome :)

Bugfixes:
- Large resultsets are now correctly handled(Bug id 467). Thanks Chris 
Wenneman.
- Null values handling are now fixed. Thanks Stuart Ballard for showing 
this problem.
- Quotes in strings are now *actually* working.

This release is very stable and have a lot of immediate functionality is 
now working. It can be used in production environments. Please, get the 
non-debug releases to production use.
Thanks all for help debugging and sending your bug reports and patches! :)
