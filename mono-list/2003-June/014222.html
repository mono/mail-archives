GNOME, where a lot of Mono programmers come from, has a similar list
called <A HREF="mailto:gnome-love@gnome.org.">gnome-love@gnome.org.</A> I've never been involved with it, so I
can't say how successful it is, but that would be a place to look for
ideas or experience.

That being said, I think one of the pluses of working in C# is that it's
pretty easy to just start writing code and make something that works,
especially with the current state of the class libraries. Still, from
the number of people that post 'I want to help out' messages, it looks
like we can do better.
