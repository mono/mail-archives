Hello, 
I read the faq questions at your site hoping to find an answer to my
question, but I'm still unsure of the answer.  Here is my question:

We currently develop software for multiple platforms in C, including unix,
linux, and win32 platforms.  This is a very tedious process and we have
recently opted for porting all our code to java to make our life easier.  I
have been interested in Microsoft .Net for some time now as a possible
alternative to java for writing code one time that will work in any
platform, but I haven't really found any examples out there of how to use
Microsoft's .Net on unix platforms.  

I'm interested in Mono as a possible solution, but I'm not sure if it will
do what I'm looking for:   Is it possible to write web and windows
applications using Microsoft's .Net classes and compiler (in C#) , and then
execute that code in unix platforms just using the mono CLR in Unix, or
would I have to actually write the application using Mono's .Net open source
classes instead of the Microsoft .Net classes, which means I would be
learning new classes all over again?   In other words, is it possible to
write the application on a windows platform using Microsof'ts latest .Net
tools (C#) and compiler, and then run them on a unix platform that uses the
Mono CLR?  Would the Mono CLR resolve the Microsoft .Net classes used to
write the application to aliases (compatible classes) in Mono, or how would
this work?.  Meaning, do I have to learn the new classes in Mono and the
apis in Mono in order to write .Net applications or can I still write my
applications in Microsoft .Net and let the Mono CLR take care of the rest
when I wan't to run the same application on unix?

Thanks,



Joe Roberts
