<PRE>I have the standard boiler-plate answer ready for you (below), but it
summarizes to: fix bugs, write new code, writes tests, and help other
developers (documentation, HOWTOs).

These may be appropriate for a MS project.  I can't answer that, as I
don't know what requirements you need to fulfill.

On the more &quot;interesting&quot; side of things, you could also look into
Gnome/Bonobo+Mono interop, possibly using Remoting.Corba; see:

	<A HREF="http://remoting-corba.sourceforge.net/">http://remoting-corba.sourceforge.net/</A>

I have no idea how easy that would be; all I do know is that someone was
looking into it on IRC last night, and they were unable to get it
working.  This (in my mind) would likely qualify for a MS project.

On with the standard answer...

  - Work on the class libraries.  See:

	<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/class-status.html">http://www.go-mono.com/class-status.html</A>

    The classes listed are the classes that need work, are incomplete,
    etc.  Find a namespace that interests you and start implementing.

    If you contribute to the class libraries, you should join
    mono-devel-list:

        <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list">http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list</A>

    See also:

        <A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/contributing.html">http://www.go-mono.com/contributing.html</A>

    Personally, I know that the EventLog and PerformanceCounter classes
    in the System.Diagnostics namespace (System.dll) could use some
    loving...and a good portable solution. :-)

    Or, you might be interested in re-implementing System.Xml in C#,
    for portability, fewer dependencies, and the elimination of
    temporary files.  Though, this *has* been estimated as being 9+
    months of work...  :-)

    You could also try asking on IRC for further examples.

  - Bug Fixes: See <A HREF="http://bugzilla.ximian.com,">http://bugzilla.ximian.com,</A> and look at the bugs for:
      gtk#
      Mono/Class Libraries
      Mono/Debugger
      Mono/Doctools
      Mono/mcs
      Mono/runtime

  - Documentation.  Lots is needed.  It's in the monodoc CVS module.
    See also: <A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/documentation.html">http://www.go-mono.com/documentation.html</A>
    However, you might want to wait on this until the documentation
    editor is complete.

    If you contribute to Documentation, you should join mono-docs-list:

        <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-docs-list">http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-docs-list</A>


  - HOWTOs.  These are in the monkeytalk CVS module, and can be seen at:

	<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/tutorial/html/en/index.html">http://www.go-mono.com/tutorial/html/en/index.html</A>

  - Test Cases:  Either implement more, or fix the bugs that they are
    finding.  NUnit2 is used for test cases.

    I've heard that there are lots of mono bugs found by the
    current test cases, and these should be fixed.

Hope this helps.

 - Jon
