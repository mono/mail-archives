<PRE>Someone mentioned a few weeks ago that it would be easier for newbies if
the instructions said to use the source tarballs on the download page. I
personally have found that to be the case, as I had the same problem you
did.

1) Download mono-0.24.tar.gz and compile/install it
2) Do a cvs checkout of the modules &quot;mcs&quot; and &quot;mono&quot; The instructions for
this are on the website. Just put the commands in a shell script or batch
file so that you update both each time you check the source respository.
3) cd to the mcs folder and try to compile

For some reason, I wasn't able to get it to build under Mandrake 9.1 until
I completely removed the 9.1 RPMS of Mono and Mono-Devel and built it from
source.


On a slightly different note, can someone far more knowledgeable than I
tell me what the MCS/MBAS and assemblies that are distributed in the
nightly tarballs are built from? Are they built from the same sources that
one finds in the MCS folder of that tarball?
