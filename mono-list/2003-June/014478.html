<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> &gt; You need to rewrite the tool just to put it put it in a cron job?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Seems a bit drastic to me.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd say a better solution would be to fix reflection in the runtime so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it'll run on mono.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's not the issue.
</I>&gt;<i> How do you compare attribute values? You can't with the reflection API.
</I>
The only issues running the corcompare tools on Linux today are:

	* Need to setup makefiles to use a &quot;reference&quot; dll implementation
	  for the compare process (should be easy).

	* Need a replacement for the JScript script that does the XSLT
	  transformation.

Other features could be added later (Paolo correctly points out that we
might need more information that we can extract today with Reflection),
but in the short term, just getting those two things done would be a
big win.

Miguel.
