<PRE>I've been doing some research on the CLI and have a quick question on
how Mono implements the CIL Object Model Instructions. 

As mentioned in partition 3 of the CLI, the Object Model Instructions
could theoretically be translated into a series of Base Instructions,
and while such an implementation would complicate the JIT process, I
presume it would simplify the creation of a JIT compiler for different
platforms.

So the question I have is does Mono take this approach for JITing or
does it do something cleverer? I did have a quick scan through the
source, but I'm a bit new to the source and haven't got my bearings yet.

Cheers

Mark
