The use of tables has nothing to do with the issue we were discussing.
Besides, if you're optimizing for the status pages, by the time you're
done we hope to have reduced significantly the size of those pages
anyway:-)

&gt;<i>       * More maintainable: Even if we don't get our new corcompare tool,
</I>&gt;<i>         this will be easier for Miguel. Right now, to update the page he

</I>&gt;<i>         transfer. With the transform on the web server he can 1) boot to

</I>&gt;<i>         is very important to him.
</I>
You're off-base with the priorities: the main issue is point 1, all the
rest can be automated. If the new site/tools don't eliminate step 1,
they are useless.

&gt;<i> Remember, by &quot;dynamic&quot; I do *not* mean that the files are transformed on
</I>&gt;<i> each request. I am planning on caching the results. But since the
</I>&gt;<i> transform is taking place on the server, I don't want to take up gobs of
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessary CPU time.
</I>
And the best way to avoid that is to do the transform offline: very
simple, very effective, very reliable and very fast.
