Just to name a few:

&gt;<i> 2. Also why one should decide to use Mono instead of Java to write

</I>&gt;<i> requirement for server is to run on linux with top performance).
</I>
There are tons of reasons, but a lot of the final decisions come down to
personal opinions.

- - great performance, scalability
- - good integration with great web servers (better than Java)
- - many languages for different levels of engineers
(<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Languages">http://www.mono-project.com/Languages</A>)
- - Mono keeps getting faster and faster (despite already being very fast)
- - .NET (Mono) is continually evolving, whereas Java is very slow at it

And finally, book sales are an interesting indicator:

Java has been continually shrinking whereas other languages like .NET
(Mono) have been rising.

&gt;<i> 3. Are we going to face any performance issues as application grows in
</I>&gt;<i> size and complexity? What are the performance issues when an application
</I>&gt;<i> runs on top of Mono as compared to an application written using c/c++.
</I>
Nothing just &quot;scales&quot;, so it depends on how you design the applications
architecture. And when comparing C/C++ to other languages you have to
take into account time-to-life as compared to performance.

C/C++
 - SLOW time to life
 - can have best performance

.NET/Java
 - good time to life
 - can have great performance

Python / dynamic languages
 - great time to life
 - can have very good performance if not great
 - lack of &quot;Types&quot; can make team projects &quot;complicated&quot;

The only way to know if you should use Mono is to &quot;use Mono&quot;. I've been
using it before there where &quot;releases&quot; and I would never trade it for
Java. Just remember that no language or framework is &quot;the entire tool
chest&quot;, so pick the right tools.

I hope that helps.
