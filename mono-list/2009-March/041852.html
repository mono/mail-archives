<PRE>I want to make sure that I understand this proposed GSoC task correctly:
&#8220;Using Silverlight 2.0 build the UI for video editing software&#8221;.
Below I wrote my understanding of the deliverable, my questions, bio, and
risks. Please tell me if I got the idea right, thanks!


The deliverable will be a user-friendly Silverlight application for
in-browser video editing. The app will be somewhat like

   - the GSoC 2005 Diva Video Editor <A HREF="http://mono-project.com/Summer2005#Diva">http://mono-project.com/Summer2005#Diva</A>
   ,
   - the Top Banana MIX2007
   <A HREF="http://silverlight.net/learn/learnvideo.aspx?video=125">http://silverlight.net/learn/learnvideo.aspx?video=125</A> applications.

The well polished GUI should resemble specialized software like Apple&#8217;s
iMovie and Adobe&#8217;s After Effects. The GUI will consist of:

   - preview area for the video,
   - timeline editor with drag-and-drop editing, skimming, trimming, cut &amp;
   paste, slicing.
   - resource list (media library).
   - Tools to apply effects and transitions to the clips.

The sample application should work within web browsers supporting
Silverlight 2.0, be written in clean, maintainable code.

Questions:


   1. The Diva Video Editor was an incredible GUI program. We want a similar
   Silverlight/Moonlight alternative?
   2. I am most comfortable working in C# in Visual Studio 2008, may I
   implement this application in Visual Studio 2008 and Expression Blend Suite?

About me:

My name is Dmitri Sadakov. I have a master&#8217;s degree in computer science,
going on to PhD in CS, both from Saint Petersburg Polytechnic University,
Russia. I&#8217;ve been a computer engineer for around 8 years, 6 of it devoted to
C#, ASP.Net, and winforms. The most complicated coding project I have been
involved in is NYSE backend website (<A HREF="http://www.nyse.com/">http://www.nyse.com/</A>) and the Eluma (
<A HREF="http://blog.go2web20.net/2008/05/eluma-as-desktop-client-for-friendfeed.html">http://blog.go2web20.net/2008/05/eluma-as-desktop-client-for-friendfeed.html</A>).
My open source experience includes coding my masters degree application as
open source samba crawler &amp; search interface, Lan-Crawler (
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lan-crawler/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/lan-crawler/</A>). The last 2 years I have been
working in ASP.Net, Dreamweaver, Photoshop, and objective-c, I am most
comfortable working with C#.

Creating an in-browser video editing application in Silverlight should be
worth spending time on this summer. I am eager to increase Silverlight
skills, and help the open source community. Also, lately I have been working
a lot with Adobe After Effects for video editing and creating motion
graphics.

Risks:


   - I will need to research to understand the mechanics of grabbing images
   from video streams.
   - Same for the mechanics of applying transitions and effects
   - Moonlight 2.0 Beta will be released mid May 2009
   <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/MoonlightRoadmap">http://www.mono-project.com/MoonlightRoadmap</A> , there is a big chance of
   this video editor to not work on that beta.
   - The project might prove to be too hard for my experience with
   silverlight, then again it might not.

Thanks,
Dmitri Sadakov
