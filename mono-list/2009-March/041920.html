<PRE>Hello,

my name is Olexandr Melnyk and I am a third-year Ukrainian student. I
would like to present my proposal for Summer of Code &quot;PL/Mono: a
procedural language for PostgreSQL&quot;. The objective of my project is to
add support for writing PostgreSQL functions in managed languages.
PostgreSQL functions are often referred to as &quot;stored procedures&quot;, but
apart from that usage they serve a broad range of purposes (eg. they
are also used for implementing triggers).

So far I've found a couple of places, which I'm uncertain about and
would like to make clear before I submit an application.

1) I see three ways of specifying functions in CREATE FUNCTION statement:
- embedding C# code into the statement (PL/Python and PL/Perl do that):
    CREATE FUNCTION SUM(INT) RETURNS INT
    AS $$
        public static int Add(int x, int y)
        {
            return x + y;
        }
    $$ LANGUAGE PLMONO;
This approach is the easiest to use, but is C#-specific. And extra
(little) work is needed to add support for a new managed language.

- by specifying an assembly filename and a fully qualified function name:
    CREATE FUNCTION SUM(INT) RETURNS INT
    AS 'Library1.dll:Namespace2.Class3.Function4'
    LANGUAGE PLMONO;
Assemblies are searched in directories specified by a config variable,
or a full path should be provided.

- by a fully qualified function name (this approach is taken by
PL/Java and is my personal favorite):
    CREATE FUNCTION SUM(INT) RETURNS INT
    AS 'Namespace1.Class2.Function3'
    LANGUAGE PLMONO;
Functions are searched in assemblies from directories specified by a
config variable.

2) If we go with the approach 2 or 3, should all managed functions
exposed to PostgreSQL world be marked with some special attribute? For
example:

public static class FunctionLibrary
{
    [PostgresFunc]
    public static int Add(int x, int y)
    {
        return x + y;
    }
}

Requiring an attribute would mean that functions can be used from SQL,
only if they were really intended for that. However, this would also
mean that to use a harmless function from standard namespaces (like
System.Math.Abs), one would need to make a wrapper.

I have already briefly discussed my proposal on IRC, but would be glad
to get some more feedback.

Sincerely yours,
Olexandr Melnyk
