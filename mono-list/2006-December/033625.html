<PRE>This is a call for testing :)

Code for providing native support for vs2005 solutions/projects is in
svn now, in the prj2make-sharp-lib. Native support means that you can
directly open vs2005 projects in monodevelop. Any changes made to the
project through monodevelop would get reflected in the project
file. So you can effectively share the same project files between VS2005 and
MonoDevelop.

If you try to add a monodevelop solution/project (.mds/.mdp) to a
vs2005 solution,
then it will be converted to the vs2k5 equivalent files (solution
folders/csproj etc).

The addin tries to do non-destructive writes of the sln/project files,
i.e., it will (try) not
to delete things that it doesn't understand.

It hasn't really seen much testing besides by that done by myself.
You'll need monodevelop from SVN for
trying this out. Its not complete yet, but seems to be working fine for most
cases (that i tried :). Would be nice if we can see what doesn't work or what
else is required to be supported in this.

Thanks
