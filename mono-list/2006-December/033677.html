I don't see what disk space has to do with anything. I would prefer to 
contribute to a spec that is maintained outside of the competing 
implementation's repository in the same way that I deal with other 
freedesktop.org specifications, but if that isn't the way you want to do 
things, I can live with that.

I can't really tell my users that they are using a &quot;second class&quot; 
implementation. You are welcome to hold that opinion.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I certainly welcome proposed protocol enhancements (in fact I'd very 
</I>&gt;<i> much want to see such proposals), and we could even include &quot;optional 
</I>&gt;<i> features&quot; in the spec that the reference implementation does not have.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The most important thing for making other implementations work well, 
</I>&gt;<i> imo, is an implementation-independent test suite (ideally including an 
</I>&gt;<i> interoperability testing framework)
</I>
I look forward to working together on new features and test suites. 
There's no doubt that D-Bus is helping developers put out better 
applications, and that's all that matters.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I wasn't planning on bringing up this issue, but it has to be

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was just saying &quot;if someone is writing docs for you anyway, they may

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If nobody is writing docs for you and you're &quot;reverse engineering&quot; (so 
</I>&gt;<i> to speak), then spec patches would be extra work, so it's up to you.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> btw, I doubt you need to be rigorously clean room here as I understand 
</I>&gt;<i> it. Clean room is more about making it easy to *prove* you aren't a

</I>&gt;<i> other words as long as you just refer to what the dbus reference code 
</I>&gt;<i> does rather than basing your code on the dbus reference code, you could 
</I>&gt;<i> AIUI look at the reference code. Which would probably help make the two 
</I>&gt;<i> implementations more interoperable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, the worst case if a court declares your implementation a derived 
</I>&gt;<i> work is that you have to license those portions deemed to be derived 
</I>&gt;<i> under the AFL, which is virtually identical to the MIT license anyhow in 
</I>&gt;<i> practical effect.
</I>
I am doing a a clean room implementation to provide validation for your 
design and specification, not because I think your code is tainted. 
Maybe you missed this point.
