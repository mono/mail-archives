</I>&gt;<i> If no one else is working on this, I will begin integrating.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>AFAIK, no one is working on this, so it would be great to have it added.

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1)       Is anyone already working on this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>not that I know

&gt;<i> 2)      Which version of the code should I start with?  The latest
</I>&gt;<i> CVS, or 0.19?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>you should be using, if possible, CVS for developement. If not possible,
0.19 is the last one

&gt;<i> 3)      Is it preferable to develop in WinXP w/ Cygwin, or under
</I>&gt;<i> RedHat 8.0? (I intend to test under both).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>it's better to do it on free software, whatever that is (linux, bsd,
...) :-)

&gt;<i> 4)      In what format, and where or to whom should I submit my
</I>&gt;<i> changes?  Entire replacement files?  DIFFs with the originals?  I may
</I>&gt;<i> have firewall issues with CVS – I definitely do at work, and I only
</I>&gt;<i> have NetZero (free) Internet at home.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>the best thing is to send us cvs diff (cvs diff -u). If you can't use
CVS, a diff against the latest release, or, even better, latest snapshot
might be enough.

cheers
