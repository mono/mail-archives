<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; we have an in-development reporting system in libgda. That is not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; covered by the GDA# bindings (part of GTK#), but as soon as we've got
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something working (which should be soon, since we now have a person
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; working on that), I'll add bindings for the reporting stuff to GDA#.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, maybe you can just wait for those bindings, or help us in finishing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; them up ASAP.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As a quick intro, the reporting stuff we're doing is XML-based, where we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have a DTD that describes the structure of the report, and then, that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; file is run through the reporting engine, which fills it in with data
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from the database. This is what we're hoping to complete very soon. Once
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we've got that, we'll make conversions to many formats via XSLT, which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; shouldn't be hard at all.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> also forgot to say that the reporting stuff will include printing
</I>&gt;<i> support, so you'll just have a Print method or something to print it
</I>&gt;<i> out.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
	It's an evaluation, i have to do a demo program to show it. i think
i'll take the browser aproach. We'll change lately to gda# if we do the
program definetely with mono.

Thx for all.
