<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> It's unlikely you're going to get this to work. The C++ runtime
</I>&gt;<i> initialization that the Managed C++ compiler links in is x86 code that
</I>&gt;<i> depends on the Windows API, so it'll be hard to get it to run on Linux.
</I>
As long as it is only the initialization code, the few routines that are
used can be faked, so that should be no problem.

The large body of work though would be to make Mono able to execute the
native x86 code.  It would be an interesting project for someone
interested in this, and many people would appreciate it.

It is not a priority for us (Ximian) to make this happen at this point,
as native x86 code is not portable to other systems, so we rather assume
it is just an Intel hack.

Miguel
