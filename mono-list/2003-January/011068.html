<PRE>Hi Adam.

As I only have Linux too, you can think of my previous email as written
with a Linux user point of view. :-)

Jaime.

Btw. For more experiences: my girlfriend is using Mono on a Debian Woody
and I lend her the &quot;Teach Yourself C# in 21 days&quot; and she's in love with
it. Although she has been working as a FORTRAN developer and has some
knowledge on C++, she says that the book is the best for her of my
collection. I use Debian Sarge with Mono and it works equally well. 

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Which one of these books would be best for learning C#/Mono?  I don't have 
</I>&gt;<i> a Win32 box, or a copy of Windows, but I'd like to use Mono as it seems 
</I>&gt;<i> like a nice way to solve several types of problems.  But I'll be doing it 
</I>&gt;<i> all on a Linux box.
