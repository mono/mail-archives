<PRE>This is VERY Off Topic, but some of you guys seem to be very familiar with
GTK, so maybe you can clarify things for me:

I've installed GTK# and GTK+ on Windows and have some questions.
The whole idea of having GTK+/GTK# on Windows is cool, but:

1. Is it possible to statically compile GTK+ programs (using C, not C#) so
they wouldn't require few megs of DLLs? I assume that by static linking only
functions that are actually used would get linked in.

2. As a long-time Windows user, I don't like the way GTK+ renders menus,
buttons and scrollbars. Is it possible to:

- use standard windows menus and menu bars (perhaps with owner-draw options)
instead of custom-drawn? No matter how much time you're going to spend
emulating windows l&amp;f, you're never gonna get it. MS seems to change the
feel of menus with every win version and by using owner draw mechanism you
can adhere to it.

- use standard windows buttons instead of GTK buttons. You can also use
owner draw here, and it gives you the correct behaviour.

3. As a long-time Win32 programmer I have some questions:

- Is it possible to use standard windows colors. There are 2 Win32 APIs
GetSysColor() and GetSysColorBrush() that can be used to achieve this.

- Is it possible (in general) to use CreateWindow()-based controls as
widgets with GTK+ windows. In particular is it possible to use windowed
ActiveX controls?
