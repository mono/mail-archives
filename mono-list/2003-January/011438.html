<PRE>Hello everyone!

   We have made a new release of Mono available.  Despite the fact
that we just did Mono 0.18, this release is packed with new features.

* Availability.

   Mono 0.19 is available in package format from:

	<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/download.html">http://www.go-mono.com/download.html</A>

   We released packages for SuSE 8.0, Mandrake 8.2, Debian and various
Red Hat releases.  It is also available from Red Carpet on the Mono
channel.

   Source code for Mono, MCS, the Mono Debugger, XSP is available as
well from that web page. 

* New in this release

	* Remoting news:

		Lluis has implemented and documented the Binary formatter
		Woohoo!  He has done a lot of work as well to support
		remoting.

		Patrik has also been working heavily on fixing a
		number of remoting related bugs and missing features.

		Ajay also implemented 1-d array serialization in System.Xml

	* New database provider: IBM DB2

		Christopher Bockner has contributed a DB2 data
		provider for System.Data.  We have a very complete
		range of data providers.
		
	* System.Web.Mobile

		Gaurav has started work on this assembly, this will
		allow us to run the unmodified reference ASP.NET
		applications that were designed to support Mobile
		browsing.

	* System.Data and System.XML:

		More implementation work on XmlDataDocument from Ville
		and plenty of fixes from Atsushi.

	* MacOS patches:

		Paolo integrated John Duncan's and Benjamin Reed
		patches to make Mono run on MacOS X out of the box.

	* IsolatedStorage

		The initial implementation of it was done by Jonathan
		Pryor and included in this release.

	* Compilers:

		More work on the Mono Visual Basic compiler (it is now
		included in the packages).

		Plenty of bug fixes from Jackson, Miguel to the C#
		compiler.

		Patches from Francesco and Daniel to the VB.NET
		support runtime.

	* Debugger support

		Plenty of updates to run the new Mono Debugger from Martin.

* Main missing bits:

   Some of everyone's favorite patches or code chunks have not yet
been integrated, hopefully Mono 0.20 will have them:

	* Zoltan's patch to run IKVM is not yet on this release

	* Some parts of Patrik's remoting code did not make it to the
	  release either.

	* Reggie's MySQL native provider is also missing.

Enjoy!
Miguel.
