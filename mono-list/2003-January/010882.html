Yes, I have no objection to relicensing, multiple licenses, or whatever.  Basically I have no agenda here, I'm just happy to see the code get used.

A related note: I believe Gopal V (<A HREF="mailto:gopalv82@dotgnu.org">gopalv82@dotgnu.org</A>) has just checked the JANET code into Portable.Net.  Since some of the next steps are pretty obvious (finish ECMAScript 3, add JScript.net support, etc.), it would be a shame to see the code forked.  I've never participated actively in an open-source project before, let alone dealt with code that was shared by two projects, so I don't know how to address this.  As the original author, I could try to act as a coordinator or moderator for the core JavaScript code.  (It might not make sense to share more than the core code in any case, as each project might have a different agenda for how the JavaScript compiler is to be integrated into the rest of the system.)

Restated: I do not feel competent to propose a specific mechanism for sharing the JavaScript compiler code between Mono and Portable.Net, but if someone else can propose a mechanism, I am happy to help implement it.


&gt;<i> &gt; * is the current split in assemblies ok (PrettyPrinter.dll,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> JPrimitive.dll, JObjects.dll, etc)? or should we have a single JANET
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> assembly?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Single assembly sounds nice to me;  It seems like the current split was
</I>&gt;<i>done to implement partial compilation.
</I>
Yes, and also because at the time I didn't fully understand how the C# compiler worked.  The whole thing is small enough that a single assembly probably makes much more sense.


&gt;<i> &gt; * do you have Steve's 'TODO' list?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I do not.
</I>
I'm in the process of editing it down to a readable form.  I'll try to get it posted by tommorrow.
