<PRE>&gt;<i>-Inside C#: The best book on C# if you have a little previous knowledge
</I>&gt;<i>on programming.
</I>&gt;<i>-C# Unleashed: it's ok, but I don't like it much.
</I>&gt;<i>-Programming C#: Very good for beginners with no knowledge of
</I>&gt;<i>programming, it covers many areas but it's quite VS.NET friendly.
</I>&gt;<i>-Teach Yourself C# in 21 days: if you have no experience with Java or if
</I>&gt;<i>you are new to programming, this is the best book for you in order to
</I>&gt;<i>start.
</I>&gt;<i>-Programming Microsoft Windows with C#: really nice for advanced design
</I>&gt;<i>using System.Drawing, etc. Not for beginners.
</I>&gt;<i>-Applied Microsoft.NET Framework Programming: the very best book for you
</I>&gt;<i>if you know some C# and want to develop real world applications.
</I>&gt;<i>-Thinking in C#: I respect it because it's Mono friendly and one of
</I>&gt;<i>Bruce Eckel's books but I really don't like it that much as I enjoyed
</I>&gt;<i>the Thinking in Java one.
</I>
Which one of these books would be best for learning C#/Mono?  I don't have 
a Win32 box, or a copy of Windows, but I'd like to use Mono as it seems 
like a nice way to solve several types of problems.  But I'll be doing it 
all on a Linux box.
