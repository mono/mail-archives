<PRE>Hi all,

This is my first post to the mono list and I think the work you guys =
have done so far is great.

Is it possible to make a suggestion?

Would you consider having a Linux server with apache, modmono and maybe =
mysql or postgres sql (One of the free ones) where
developers could get 5-25 MB of web space.

This would allow people to test their applications without needing =
knowledge of apache and Linux (I know neither, I'm an IIS WIN2K
Developer).

The benefits would be it would get lots of people quickly testing the =
aspx support provided by mono, and possibly have them
submitting additions and bug reports etc.

It would also be a pretty impressive statement on how far aspx support =
has come.

Havent tried aspx support yet but thought this would be a good idea to =
encourage people to test it and build for it.

Of course I don=92t know the costs involved with this but I think the =
pros outweigh the cons.

Regards,

John
