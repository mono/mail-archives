No, I was never 'in charge' of writing this patch.  I think it is silly to 
create a mailing list and a kludge patch where i'd be the only subscriber to 
mono-devel-list and everyone else would be on mono-hackers.

You said you'd create the list when you returned from Mexico and when you 
didn't I asked and you gave this excuse.  Why can't you just set up a regular 
mailing list like all of the others.  As we discussed, you could use 
mono-hackers/secrets for your confidential information and the development 
discussion could take place on an open mailing list.
