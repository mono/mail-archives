<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Would that I could, but that's not an option.  I have 500,000+ lines of 
</I>&gt;<i> extant C++ code representing 6 years of work that I cannot rewrite to be 
</I>&gt;<i> less object oriented.
</I>
I mentioned this before, but it might have gotten lost in the
discussion.

A few months ago, there were a number of interesting patches to the Mono
runtime.  None of the patches were mature, but they could be productized
if there is a need for it.

The patches essentially made the Mono object layout and class layout
match the C++ compiler layout, and it allowed C++/.NET objects to be
&quot;mirrored&quot;.  There are some important details that need to be taken into
consideration, but if your investment in C++ is so big, there are
options to integrate with C# on Unix, they are just not part of the
current offering.

This is a unique opportunity to get involved with Mono, or hire your
favorite C++ ABI guru to have it do for you.  You could find on the
mailing list the details of the work.

Miguel
