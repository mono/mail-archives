<PRE>Steven,

Thanks for your thoughts and explaination of the MS licensing.  The code is 
structured to host various kinds of applications (each is essentially a 
plug-in).  One of those applications is &quot;web&quot;.  When I started this project, 
the XSP server was not yet available...and Cassini was a good starting 
point.

This afternoon I took a snapshot of the XSP server and created a new 
XSPApplication plug-in which can be a replacement for the Cassini-based 
application host.  So, if distributing the MS code is a problem, I can make 
it a seperate download.  The download would include a lightweight wrapper + 
the MS code.  Does this sound like a good solution?

Thanks for your comments,
Brian

</I>&gt;<i>I hope this is more along the lines of advice and guidance.  This is my 
</I>&gt;<i>take
</I>&gt;<i>on the licensing issues involved.  I don't wish to intentionally provide 
</I>&gt;<i>any
</I>&gt;<i>opinions about the &quot;goodness&quot; or &quot;badness&quot; of the licenses involved, just 
</I>&gt;<i>my
</I>&gt;<i>understanding of how the issues apply in this case. I am not a lawyer just 
</I>&gt;<i>a
</I>&gt;<i>developer who has read many license agreements; so I am interested to hear
</I>&gt;<i>what others may say about this issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I haven’t looked at the Appserver source code yet to see what you have
</I>&gt;<i>redistributed (and as you will see later in my discussion even if I did 
</I>&gt;<i>look
</I>&gt;<i>at your source code, only you may know what can be redistributed); however,
</I>&gt;<i>I did take a look at the Cassini stuff as well as some other &quot;free&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>Microsoft software a couple of weeks ago when I last looked at your app
</I>&gt;<i>server (basically because you referenced it in your site).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I downloaded and installed the Cassini server; the EULA which is used to
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;click-wrap&quot; the software (i.e. you can't install it until you agree to it)
</I>&gt;<i>is attached.  Read it carefully; especially section 2.2; I like to refer to
</I>&gt;<i>this as the Microsoft Anti-Open-Source License agreement.  Basically you 
</I>&gt;<i>can
</I>&gt;<i>use their code for your own purposes, and can even re-distribute it inside
</I>&gt;<i>your own product (even sell your product) as long as you don't redistribute
</I>&gt;<i>your product as open source software (they don't say it directly, but that
</I>&gt;<i>is my interpretation of their legalese--read the last part of paragraph
</I>&gt;<i>2.2).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If your intention is to use the Cassini server temporarily to create other
</I>&gt;<i>functionality and then later plug in some other open source product (mono 
</I>&gt;<i>or
</I>&gt;<i>something else) to take the place of the Cassini server then your code can
</I>&gt;<i>remain open sourced; as long as your code does not directly include any of
</I>&gt;<i>the Cassini code; however you are not able to redistribute any components 
</I>&gt;<i>of
</I>&gt;<i>the Cassini server (you could however provide a link to the Cassini server
</I>&gt;<i>for those who wish to try your functionality).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>You have to be very careful to keep from infringing on Microsoft's 
</I>&gt;<i>property;
</I>&gt;<i>most open source projects are very good about identifying each source file
</I>&gt;<i>as being covered by the appropriate open source license; Microsoft just
</I>&gt;<i>includes the clause:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>/*=======================================================================
</I>&gt;<i>  Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   THIS CODE AND INFORMATION ARE PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
</I>&gt;<i>   KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE
</I>&gt;<i>   IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND/OR FITNESS FOR A
</I>&gt;<i>   PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
</I>&gt;<i>=======================================================================*/
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>However the click wrap agreement that you agreed to when you first 
</I>&gt;<i>installed
</I>&gt;<i>the software is truly the defining agreement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It would appear that microsoft uses a similar license agreement on all of
</I>&gt;<i>its &quot;ASP.Net Source Projects&quot; on www.asp.net; so anyone looking to use 
</I>&gt;<i>these
</I>&gt;<i>projects (<A HREF="http://www.asp.net/Default.aspx?tabindex=7&tabid=41">http://www.asp.net/Default.aspx?tabindex=7&amp;tabid=41</A>) should be
</I>&gt;<i>aware of the restrictions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>Steven Balthazor
