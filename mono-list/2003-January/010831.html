Try running the command in gdb and see where the trap occours,
Or, as others have suggested, really make sure you don't have user
limits set too low (set them to unlimited ti check if that is the
problem).

No, this is not possible, though we're investigating ways to reduce
memory usage.

We try to reply to all the mails on the list, but sometimes some mails
and up ignored for lack of time. If you file a bug report on
bugzilla.ximian.com and attach the patch there, your contribution won't
be lost: it's easier for us to track issues in bugzilla than to track
threads on a mailing list. Thanks!
