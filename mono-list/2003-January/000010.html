&gt;<i> Hello,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If yes, then does the current build take care of that?

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If no, then what API does the debugger use for the GUI ??
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is it GTK# ?? ... Is there a windows equilatent of GTK# like 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Glib ? If the debugger has been made in C#, can the GTK# calls
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be replaced by the equivalent Windows.Forms ones to get it up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and running on windows?? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It uses Gtk# (which works on Windows).

You can also use the command line interface for it - but then, of course, you won't have a
GUI ....

&gt;<i> You could also write a new GUI using Windows.Forms, but to get there you
</I>&gt;<i> would have to spend quite some time porting the engine first.

Ok, I just had another look at this.

I _believe_ (but I can be wrong) that this can be done in one or two working days.

The most difficult task is probably getting a shared libbfd.dll for either cygwin on
mingw32 - the latter one may be a good idea since MinGW 2.0 is already using GNU Binutils
2.13.90 (but a static libbfd.a).

After setting up the build environment and getting the debugger at least build on Windows
(without a backend), the way to go is to get core files working first - this is using
libbfd which is already ported to windows and MinGW 2.30 also comes with a recent enough
gcc 2.95.3 which should also have dwarf 2 support.

However, my windows machine is slooow so I'd prefer doing some more bug fixes and cleanups
at the moment rather than spending my time compiling stuff.

The next step is replacing backends/server/i386-*-ptrace.c with an actual implementation
which is using w32 api calls instead of ptrace.  This should be doable in one working day.
