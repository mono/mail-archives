For my case, I am worried more about the &quot;entry point&quot; into the native 
library.  That is, within a Managed C++ wrapper class, any calls made to 
heap-allocated instances of unmanaged C++ code.  That is where the 
problems occur.

</I>
Thanks, I'll check the options being used when the assembly is linked.

</I>
I would agree that for a native C interface (e.g., GTK+), that would be 
better.  From what I have seen of P/Invoke, however, it seems undesirable 
for use with a C++ API due to all the static methods.  What it really 
comes down to is that I want to write a class in C# that implements an 
interface defined in unmanaged C++.  An instance of the C# class would be 
passed through to unmanaged C++ code.  There are a lot of details 
involved with this, but the inherent object-oriented nature does not seem 
to lend itself well to the structure of P/Invoke-style code.
