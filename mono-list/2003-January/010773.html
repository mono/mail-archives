&gt;<i>     How are large C# projects, containing multiple files,  compiled? Are
</I>&gt;<i> there &quot;Makefiles&quot; for C#?  I'm trying to figure out how to compile C#
</I>&gt;<i> code which contains multple files.
</I>
Each group of files that should be compiled to a single exe or dll is just
have their names enumerated in command line to the compiler:

mcs x.cs y.cs z.cs

that would compile a x.exe file. For aditional parameters consult the man
page for mcs.

We use 'make' makefiles for that purpose, and also NANT makefiles that we
are still trying to make it work on Linux.

&gt;<i> I recently downloaded some C# code,
</I>&gt;<i> which contains &quot;*.csproj&quot; files. Are these  some sort of project files
</I>&gt;<i> used for compiling in Windows? (I'm not a Windows user)  Is there or are
</I>&gt;<i> there any plans for supporting the usage of these *.csproj files in Mono?
</I>
The .csproj files are project files created and used by MS Visual Studio.NET
development tool. Windows only. Probably we won't support it, because NANT
and make makefiles are more flexible/capable.

&gt;<i>     Also, are there any GUI tools available for compiling and developing
</I>&gt;<i> C# code?   :)
</I>
I'm currently experimenting Eclipse with  C# plug-in and Anjuta, but both
lack support for projects, just editing facilities. In that venue, I also
tried Kate, and Emacs, but most of time, I use gedit while driving the
process from a terminal window.

Martin Baulig is working on a debugger to use in console mode or with GTK2.

There's also SharpDevelop an IDE solely targetted to .Net, but currently it
only runs on Windows, because it depends in System.Windows.Forms, which is a
work-in-progress in Mono's implementation.
