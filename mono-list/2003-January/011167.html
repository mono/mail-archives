I hope this is more along the lines of advice and guidance.  This is my =
take
on the licensing issues involved.  I don't wish to intentionally provide =
any
opinions about the &quot;goodness&quot; or &quot;badness&quot; of the licenses involved, =
just my
understanding of how the issues apply in this case. I am not a lawyer =
just a
developer who has read many license agreements; so I am interested to =
hear
what others may say about this issue.

I haven=92t looked at the Appserver source code yet to see what you have
redistributed (and as you will see later in my discussion even if I did =
look
at your source code, only you may know what can be redistributed); =
however,
I did take a look at the Cassini stuff as well as some other &quot;free&quot;
Microsoft software a couple of weeks ago when I last looked at your app
server (basically because you referenced it in your site).

I downloaded and installed the Cassini server; the EULA which is used to
&quot;click-wrap&quot; the software (i.e. you can't install it until you agree to =
it)
is attached.  Read it carefully; especially section 2.2; I like to refer =
to
this as the Microsoft Anti-Open-Source License agreement.  Basically you =
can
use their code for your own purposes, and can even re-distribute it =
inside
your own product (even sell your product) as long as you don't =
redistribute
your product as open source software (they don't say it directly, but =
that
is my interpretation of their legalese--read the last part of paragraph
2.2).=20

If your intention is to use the Cassini server temporarily to create =
other
functionality and then later plug in some other open source product =
(mono or
something else) to take the place of the Cassini server then your code =
can
remain open sourced; as long as your code does not directly include any =
of
the Cassini code; however you are not able to redistribute any =
components of
the Cassini server (you could however provide a link to the Cassini =
server
for those who wish to try your functionality).

You have to be very careful to keep from infringing on Microsoft's =
property;
most open source projects are very good about identifying each source =
file
as being covered by the appropriate open source license; Microsoft just
includes the clause:

/*=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

However the click wrap agreement that you agreed to when you first =
installed
the software is truly the defining agreement.

It would appear that microsoft uses a similar license agreement on all =
of
its &quot;ASP.Net Source Projects&quot; on www.asp.net; so anyone looking to use =
these
projects (<A HREF="http://www.asp.net/Default.aspx?tabindex=3D7&tabid=3D41">http://www.asp.net/Default.aspx?tabindex=3D7&amp;tabid=3D41</A>) =
should be
aware of the restrictions.

Regards,
Steven Balthazor
