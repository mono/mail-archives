<PRE>To Whomever,

If you are taking the time to even read this I thank you,  I would love 
to be a part of this project.
I have skills but compared to you guys they are insignificant.  I don't 
care if I am only writing readme, howto's or proofreading docs someone 
else has written... I will do any mundane tasks just to be a part of this.

I am an intermediate Linux user about 5 years, mostly RH but have also 
used Slackware and Mandrake.

I make my living off Microsoft as a LAN/WAN Administrator/Analyst, to me 
&quot;Microsoft&quot; is another word for organized crime.

This means a lot to me, but I will completely understand if this gets 
ignored.


Sincerely,

Robert J. Tiffany
