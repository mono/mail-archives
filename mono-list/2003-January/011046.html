<PRE>Hmm...

I seem to remember working on that class quite a while ago (like in
the summer/early autumn).  I don't think I've really touched it since
I left web services behind to work on System.Data.  And I haven't 
actually worked on System.Data in about a month due to work and 
holidays.

My point is that I can't quite remember how all of the serializer
stuff worked.  I do know that I was trying to move a lot of things
around up until the point where it became unmanageable.  I know there
are a lot of things that need to be done in there.  Hopefully one
of the other people that worked on it will be able to offer you some
assistance.

Cheers,

Tim

&gt;<i> I'm currently doing development work inside XmlSerializer.cs.  My 
</I>&gt;<i> original intentions were to develop Deserialize(), but my example I was 
</I>&gt;<i> using an Array so I stumbled on the fact that SerializeArray() wasn't 
</I>&gt;<i> implemented yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As you can imagine, this opened up a can of worms.  I need someone to 
</I>&gt;<i> help me gain a much better understanding of the typeTable.  Arrays, as 
</I>&gt;<i> you know, have two extra Attributes associated with them, 
</I>&gt;<i> XmlArrayAttribute and XmlArrayItemAttribute and they somehow disappear 
</I>&gt;<i> from the member when it gets to the SerializeArray() method.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I notice that more generic XmlAttributes are stripped from the members 
</I>&gt;<i> when they are added to the typeTable.  There's a FillArrayType() method, 
</I>&gt;<i> but there is no intuitive place to cache these additional values.  I do 
</I>&gt;<i> not want to start create more and more objects for restoring information 
</I>&gt;<i> that we already have.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would whome ever spent the most time on this help me out with this?
