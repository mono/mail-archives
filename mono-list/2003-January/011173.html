<PRE>Happy new year!

        The Mono team is proud to release Mono 0.18, with plenty of bug
        fixes and improvements.  If you are a happy 0.17 user, this
        release is a happiness extension release.  Many bugs in the
	runtime, class libraries and C# compiler have been fixed.

	An Apache mod_mono is now available to run ASP.NET.

        Also, our special envoy in Japan has reported that there is
        some naming confussion about the naming of Mono, as can be
        seen in the following documentary material:
    
        Atsushi Enomoto shows the source of confussion:

        Nick and Duncan echo it:
