</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>we have an in-development reporting system in libgda. That is not
covered by the GDA# bindings (part of GTK#), but as soon as we've got
something working (which should be soon, since we now have a person
working on that), I'll add bindings for the reporting stuff to GDA#.

So, maybe you can just wait for those bindings, or help us in finishing
them up ASAP.

As a quick intro, the reporting stuff we're doing is XML-based, where we
have a DTD that describes the structure of the report, and then, that
file is run through the reporting engine, which fills it in with data
from the database. This is what we're hoping to complete very soon. Once
we've got that, we'll make conversions to many formats via XSLT, which
shouldn't be hard at all.

cheers
