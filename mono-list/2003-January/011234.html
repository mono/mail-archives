</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; there is no problems in using gtk# with System.Data in datagrids
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; components like sql# does, but i have two doubts how could i do reports
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; with database consulting and how i can print them? which classes i have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to see? or if i have to do it how can i do?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We do not have classes for reports, and sadly gnome-print is currently
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; missing in Gtk#
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> we have an in-development reporting system in libgda. That is not
</I>&gt;<i> covered by the GDA# bindings (part of GTK#), but as soon as we've got
</I>&gt;<i> something working (which should be soon, since we now have a person
</I>&gt;<i> working on that), I'll add bindings for the reporting stuff to GDA#.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, maybe you can just wait for those bindings, or help us in finishing
</I>&gt;<i> them up ASAP.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a quick intro, the reporting stuff we're doing is XML-based, where we
</I>&gt;<i> have a DTD that describes the structure of the report, and then, that
</I>&gt;<i> file is run through the reporting engine, which fills it in with data
</I>&gt;<i> from the database. This is what we're hoping to complete very soon. Once
</I>&gt;<i> we've got that, we'll make conversions to many formats via XSLT, which
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't be hard at all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>also forgot to say that the reporting stuff will include printing
support, so you'll just have a Print method or something to print it
out.

cheers
