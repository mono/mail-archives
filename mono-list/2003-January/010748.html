You or someone could create the SQLXML Managed classes found at
Microsoft.Data.SqlXml.

You could use the System.Data.SqlClient provider in Mono as a starting point
for it.  We have a working DataSet, XmlDataDocument, DataTable, and a
working System.Data.SqlClient data provider.  The SqlClient provider in Mono
is a Managed provider and was built using the TDS protocol in 100% C#.  It
was written by Tim Coleman.  It is based on jTDS and FreeTDS.  Ville Palo
has been working on the XML functionality in the DataSet and XmlDataDocument
classes.

Subject: [Mono-list] wishlist


  I've only dreamed of using *nix in my web farm application but I have a
few needs to to contend with before I could. For one, a data provider that
mimics SQLXML managed classes would be a huge advantage. Microsoft built
their SQLXML managed classes using TDS and I believe I know approximately
how they have done it. Secondly, I'd need the ability to write modules and
handlers (and register them in web.config's would be nice). Also, a couple
of shortcomings MS has would be nice to overcome: for example, impersonation
is great but it the impersonated user requires all the permissions to allow
the dynamic compilation of the code. This is a security risk and makes the
use of impersonation unfeasible in many ways. It would be nicer if a section
of code could be run in context of the logged (or specifed) user and the
rest of the code, including the compilation, runs as the normal ASPNET
system user. Or, maybe it would make more sense to specify which user
account context is used when complilation is performed...
