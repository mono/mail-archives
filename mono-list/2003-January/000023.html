<PRE>Hello, All,

I'm working on a story for the NY Times on security info sharing. Here are a few
questions that you guys might be able to answer:

1. Describe a situation where you narrowly avoided a break-in/hack (or thwarted
or foiled or watched or whatever) thanks to security info sharing from this list
or others like it. What about a situation where only in hindsight could you have
prevented it thanks to info security?

2. What is the best method for users to secure home systems? Should they care
about this list? Why or why not?


3. Is security through obscurity any good? What is the inherent value of info
sharing? Why is this list &quot;good?&quot; Why is it &quot;bad?&quot;

4. Include a little info about yourself.


Best,

John Biggs
