<PRE>Take a look at the System.Drawing.Printing namespace.  In Mono, it is mostly
stubs.

Most especially, take a look at the PrintDocument class.

As miguel said, C# bindings to gnome-print needs to be done in gtk#.

I'm guessing here:
If someone wanted to create reports, I would use some GUI with ideas found
in Glade and Glade# that allows a user to create a report template visually.
The report template would be saved as an XML file.  Some library later can
interpret this XML (report template) to create some Report class.  An
application would feed the data required to this Report class somehow.  The
report class could output the results as XML, HTML, PDF, allow the report to
be viewed in a report browser, or printed to paper.  If printed to paper,
the Report class would create a PrintDocument class and Print().

This would be a great opportunity for some company or some person to come
forward with a reporting system for .NET. Anyways, this is my idea for a
Mono Reporting Framework.

Currently, Crystal Reports.NET comes with certain editions of Visual
Studio.net.  However, Mono nor Linux has something like Crystal Reports
AFAIK.

Wasn't the GNUe or GNOME-DB projects working on reports?   Maybe this can be
reused somehow.

Hello,

&gt;<i> 	Congratulations for the new release. I'm evaluating if i could use at
</I>&gt;<i> this moment mono for a management application. I saw these days that
</I>&gt;<i> there is no problems in using gtk# with System.Data in datagrids
</I>&gt;<i> components like sql# does, but i have two doubts how could i do reports
</I>&gt;<i> with database consulting and how i can print them? which classes i have
</I>&gt;<i> to see? or if i have to do it how can i do?
</I>
We do not have classes for reports, and sadly gnome-print is currently
missing in Gtk#

Miguel.
