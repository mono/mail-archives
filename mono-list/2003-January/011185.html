<PRE>Hi!

I've recently fallen in love with APT-RPM for RedHat 8.0, which is a great
method of distributing RPMS, both for end users and for developers. (See
<A HREF="http://apt.freshrpms.net">http://apt.freshrpms.net</A> for some examples).

Providing RPMS for APT is as simple as generating an index for a directory
full of RPMS (by running some utility to analyze dependencies).

Would it be possible for anyone to distribute Mono RPMS this way? Can anyone
establish such a repository on www.go-mono.com or somewhere else?

It would also be great if you could provide daily (or weekly) mono builds in
RPM format for the APT repository (&quot;unstable&quot; section or sth).

Mono is such a big piece of technology now, that I think it would be helpful
if there were many smaller RPMs available instead of just a big one. Can
anyone provide me with *.spec files used to generate current RPMS? I'd like
to try to check the feasibility of splitting mono.rpm into many smaller RPMS
and distributing them via APT.

Regards,

Jarek
