Interesting indeed! I've been thinking about .NET/Mono recently
and wondering where wxWindows could fit in. So progress on this
front is great.

I'm not sure if it would help, but wxBasic solved the wxWindows/wxBasic
integration problem by semi-automating the creation of C wrappers.

See:
<A HREF="http://wxbasic.sourceforge.net/">http://wxbasic.sourceforge.net/</A>

Doing it by hand might take a Long Time. wxBasic's author David Cuny
should be able advise on adapting his wrapper code.

There's also the wxPython approach using SWIG, and the other language
bindings may provide further inspiration.

&gt;<i>For the future, I am going to go ahead and start porting over one of my

</I>&gt;<i>on porting some of the wx samples.
</I>
Fantastic!

&gt;<i>As far as hosting the project, I'm inclined to create a new SourceForge

</I>&gt;<i>lot of library/language bindings, and I was wondering if there might be

</I>
There's not really a standard place to put these things;
wxPython is in the wxWindows repository but that's just a historical
accident. Other language bindings are kept separately, usually in
their own SF projects.

Congratulation on starting this and I'm really looking forward
to seeing how it develops! I've added a link from the wxWindows
Community web page.

Thanks,

Julian
