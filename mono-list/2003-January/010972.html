Thanks, you're helping fix issues in both projects.

&gt;<i> The problem occurred as part of my testing to assess how well Qt#

</I>&gt;<i> public enum Weight { Light = 25, Normal = 50, DemiBold = 63, Bold = 75, Black 
</I>&gt;<i> = 87 } }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Pnet believed that the type of QFont.Weight.Bold was &quot;int&quot; instead of 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;QFont.Weight&quot;. The problem came down to the fact that cscc was expecting 
</I>&gt;<i> enums to be declared the way that csc and the examples in ECMA 335 do:

</I>
Paragraph 13.3 in Partition II says basically the same things, but adds
soon after:

For binding purposes (e.g. for locating a method definition from the
method reference used to call it) enums 
shall be distinct from their underlying type.  For all other purposes,
                                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
including verification and execution of 
code, an unboxed enum freely interconverts with its underlying type.

We think this sentence allows the use of the underlying type instead of
the enum type in the static fields of the enum.
The underlying issue, though, is that with the Reflection.Emit API it's
not possible to create enums as produced by csc. Once portable.net
will implement Reflection.Emit, it'll have to support this stuff anyway,
just like the MS runtime does.

</I>
Generating the fields with the enum type is better, if it's at all
possible (better mostly in the sense: better looking:-). The metadata 
loader needs to be able to deal with the interconversion from the enum 
type and the underlying type, though.

Cheers.
