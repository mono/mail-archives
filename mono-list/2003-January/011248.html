<PRE>Kunle,

Thanks for your commments.  I'm working on replacing the Cassini module with 
the XSP code from Mono.  I'll make the Cassini module a seperate download.  
Also, Miguel has pointed me in the direction of some great artwork that I 
can use.

I've been extremely busy at work, so it will be a bit before I can post 
these changes.

Cheers,
Brian

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Moreover, I don't think it reflects well on the efforts other members of

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I don't see how this is relevant at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Specifically, it's your choice of name that I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; disagree with. It's not fair that Mono should be associated with your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; AppServer in any way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Fair?. What would be a fair use of the Mono label in your _opinion_?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't think you should try to represent this as an &quot;open source&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; issue; it's far more fundamental, and what you're doing would be no more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; acceptable were you writing proprietary software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If the license permits wholesale usage and redistribution, I see no problem
</I>&gt;<i>here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The Microsoft portion that you are referring to is a component
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the system
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that could be easily removed.  It could be replaced, for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; example, with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; XSP code from Mono.  I can remove it if it is causing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problems...but I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; sure if it is...Here's a link from MS that says the code is free:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://www.asp.net/Forums/ShowPost.aspx?tabindex=1&PostID=77371">http://www.asp.net/Forums/ShowPost.aspx?tabindex=1&amp;PostID=77371</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Any legal advice is appreciated, I'm no expert on licensing issues.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There's a very good reason why the Mono developers didn't first take
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sscli/Rotor and then slowly replace Microsoft code line-by-line at their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; own leisure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The fact that Mono began before sscli/Rotor was released is one very good
</I>&gt;<i>reason I would have thought. Fears about possible MS patent claims is
</I>&gt;<i>another. And then there is the issue of license violations. None of this
</I>&gt;<i>reasons, except the license issue seem to apply to Cassini.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If the graphics are an issue, they too could be replaced.  I've
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seen many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; open source projects using such images, but if it is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem...then by all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; means, lets remove them.  Do you have links to some free images?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's not a matter of &quot;if&quot;. You're are redistributing the Microsoft
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; artwork right now and passing it off as your own.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This is just plain wrong. He very clearly states on his website that 
</I>&gt;<i>Cassini
</I>&gt;<i>is embedded. He also attributes other tools/portions appropriately. I
</I>&gt;<i>haven't downloaded the source though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This doesn't disturb
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; me at all -- I've seen it all before. However, I don't think it's fair
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on Mono developers for you to redistribute it under the &quot;Mono&quot; moniker.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Then why kick up such a fuss?. A simple reply that queried the licensing 
</I>&gt;<i>and
</I>&gt;<i>copyright issues is all that was needed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Where does original work end and re-branding begin?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Why is the difference important as long as contributors are fairly
</I>&gt;<i>attributed and their license permits such re-branding?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I draw the line
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; where Microsoft artwork and source code are included byte-for-byte
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without accreditation in a project that claims (in readme.txt) to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; under the X11 license.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>See Brian's - or rather the AppServer's - website.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Copying on this scale cannot be an oversight. This is wholesale
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; re-duplication. Considering the lack of accreditation, it could also be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; classified as plagiarism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>See above. I would have thought that Mono would benefit more if people
</I>&gt;<i>contribute well-tested, properly attributed code - copied or not - rather
</I>&gt;<i>than flaky, all-invented-here code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I'm happy to make changes that would bring this software more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in line with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the Mono project.  Hopefully we can discuss these changes in a more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; constructive way in the future.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Good rule to go by: Call it Mono* the day it hits the Mono CVS servers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Of course, I'd be rather surprised if getting your AppServer in there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from its current state is possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If it is good enough and there are no licensing/patent issues, I can see no
</I>&gt;<i>reason to exclude it from Mono. However, I fear that the Cassini license
</I>&gt;<i>properly forbids what Brian has in mind.
