<PRE>Hi David,
    I was the one who worked initially on the XmlSerializer. I had made it work
for most of the things I required (for schema serialization).
    Then I switched from the programming world and did not get time to finish
it up. I remember one of the reasons I did not implement Arrays was that how
they are serialized was not clear to me and another that it was not urgent for
me at that time. Moreover you would find things like sorting algoritm that
would make no sense to anybody why they are there. Some of the &quot;features&quot; were
added to be compatible with the MS output for compariasion etc.
    Another thing to note in the serializer is that there were a lot of other
&quot;useless&quot; classes like XmlSerializtionWriter that were not used by me since
there was no documentation available on them and the way they could be used.
Maybe they have been incorporated into XmlSerializer now.
    Let me take a look at the XmlSerializer this weekend and then I can either
complete it or provide you some ideas on how it works.
    If you could send me some sample you are trying to serialize with arrays,
maybe we can work together on it.

Cheers,
Ajay

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm currently doing development work inside XmlSerializer.cs.  My 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; original intentions were to develop Deserialize(), but my example I was 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using an Array so I stumbled on the fact that SerializeArray() wasn't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implemented yet.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As you can imagine, this opened up a can of worms.  I need someone to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; help me gain a much better understanding of the typeTable.  Arrays, as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you know, have two extra Attributes associated with them, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; XmlArrayAttribute and XmlArrayItemAttribute and they somehow disappear 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from the member when it gets to the SerializeArray() method.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I notice that more generic XmlAttributes are stripped from the members 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when they are added to the typeTable.  There's a FillArrayType() method, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but there is no intuitive place to cache these additional values.  I do 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not want to start create more and more objects for restoring information 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that we already have.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Would whome ever spent the most time on this help me out with this?
