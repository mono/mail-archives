Running mcs with the ms runtime produces the same output as with the
mono runtime (but a few bugs that we fixed in our version of
reflection.emit).

It is not a bug.
_If_ the issue is an API issue with Reflection.Emit you'll be affected as
well when you'll implement it, the fact that cscc doesn't use Reflection
doesn't matter one bit. Unless, of course, you implement a different
API.

Rhys said he already fixed it for pnet.

&gt;<i> I think Qt# is digging up quite a few bugs ... (and some &quot;virtual&quot; bugs,

</I>
It looks like this was an issue in pnet, just like the PropertyMap one, 
so please take the flame bait somewhere else.
