Yes. Most Managed C++ assemblies contain x86 code. Using some trickery it is
possible to create pure IL assemblies with MC++, but this won't allow you to
interact will with native code, so in your case this wouldn't really help.

It's unlikely you're going to get this to work. The C++ runtime
initialization that the Managed C++ compiler links in is x86 code that
depends on the Windows API, so it'll be hard to get it to run on Linux.

Jeroen
