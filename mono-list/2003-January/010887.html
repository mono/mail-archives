<PRE>Hello Andrew,
 
&gt;<i> Jeroen thanks for helping out with this :) The directory structure
</I>&gt;<i> sounds on CVS sounds great to me. The wrapper for Microsft.Jscript
</I>&gt;<i> also sounds like a good idea however are we ok to name change
</I>&gt;<i> namepaces that prefix with Microsoft? I can't see it not being ok :)
</I>&gt;<i> but I am just wondering?
</I>
We should use the same namespace to keep compatibility with the
Microsoft API.

&gt;<i>  We do need to consider the license, Miguel can you see if Steve is ok
</I>&gt;<i> with the license change and if he would like to join the effort? When
</I>&gt;<i> the questions start it will be jolly handy to have him about :) Can
</I>&gt;<i> you also ask him for the Todo's as well, if the code is close to ECMA
</I>&gt;<i> 3 then that one of the things we should be able to achieve fairly
</I>&gt;<i> quickly. 
</I>
Steve has agreed to change the license and said (on a separate post on
the list) that he will reformat his existing notes and post them for the
sake of those working on the compiler.
 
&gt;<i> Miguel you have said you would  like the compiler to use
</I>&gt;<i> System.Reflection, I had a look at the class status and this namespace
</I>&gt;<i> does not appear to be started/in progress? Or I am wrong about that? 
</I>
System.Reflection is one of those pieces in Mono that is very advanced,
as the Mono C# compiler depends entirely on it to get its work done. 

Note also that the class status pages only show what is missing from a
class or what has known problems.  If a class is fully implemented, it
will not show up on the class status page (this is something that we
should probably make more obvious at some point, because its becoming
confusing).

Miguel.
