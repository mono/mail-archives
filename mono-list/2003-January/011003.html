<PRE>Hi,

I think this kind of collabration would also be a good thing, I do agree
with Steve that we should host in a neutral place and using sourceforge
means we should be able to setup a list (thus we can avoid cross posting
to mono/dotgnu lists) for all interested parties.

As JANET is not in the dotgnu tree we are not forking the code but
rather allowing common libs to be shared across the projects. 

Thanks

Andrew

Having multiple implementations of the spec is a good thing.  This
doesn't mean they can't cooperate, or even share chunks of code, though.
