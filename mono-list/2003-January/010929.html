<PRE>Hi Jeroen,
 
I have started to document the code and have added the following mods.
 
* Fixed issue that was preventing code from compiling.
* Fixed issue where no parameters to the compiler caused a crash, it now errors cleanly
* Added header info to compiler, I have based it around the header info in the mono compiler, not sure if the info is correct it will need checking.
 
In order to get these mods in the code (when the code is on CVS) I am assuming I will need to create a patch, (never made one before so) for that I will need some help :)
 
I don't have a CVS account yet?
 
Thanks
 
Andrew

	&gt;I do want to document the C# code that we have at the moment (another reason for Steves presence) I think this well help us understand the compiler as is now so the migration to IL will hopefully be easier and will also help us document the compiler.
	&gt;
	Ok, documenting the current code is a good idea indeed.
	Do you have a mono CVS account?
	
	&gt;Jeroen I would be interested to hear your ideas on the approach to migrate the compiler to IL and how we can host the compiler as a class.
	&gt;
	I have no idea yet :(
	
	I'm hoping to learn more about both JScript, C# and the Reflection API
	as we go (I'l be fair, my C# experience is limited until now - mostly
	looked at / small bugfixes in existing code, I haven't written any
	'real' C# code myself yet).
