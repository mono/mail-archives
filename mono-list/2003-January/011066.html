<PRE>I have seen most of the C# books out there and got 11 (six on C# others
on .NET but using C#). My experience is:

overview: sad to say it (as a O'Reilly fan), but in general MS Press
wins.

-Inside C#: The best book on C# if you have a little previous knowledge
on programming.

-C# Unleashed: it's ok, but I don't like it much.

-Programming C#: Very good for beginners with no knowledge of
programming, it covers many areas but it's quite VS.NET friendly.

-Teach Yourself C# in 21 days: if you have no experience with Java or if
you are new to programming, this is the best book for you in order to
start.

-Programming Microsoft Windows with C#: really nice for advanced design
using System.Drawing, etc. Not for beginners.

-Applied Microsoft.NET Framework Programming: the very best book for you
if you know some C# and want to develop real world applications.

-Thinking in C#: I respect it because it's Mono friendly and one of
Bruce Eckel's books but I really don't like it that much as I enjoyed
the Thinking in Java one.

There are two other things out there for you: msdn.microsoft.com and
the sources in the Mono CVS.

Cheers,

Jaime.
