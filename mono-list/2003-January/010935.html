<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> In the JANET source, the files JPrimitive.cs, JObjects.cs, and
</I>&gt;<i> JRuntime.cs are essentially all &quot;helper code&quot; in this sense.  The
</I>&gt;<i> other files are only needed for compilation (and operations like
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;eval&quot;), but these three files, two of which are fairly large, are
</I>&gt;<i> needed to support the compiled code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One key point is that currently, JANET generates a call to the support
</I>&gt;<i> library for every operation.  This is because so far I've only
</I>&gt;<i> implemented ECMAScript 3, which doesn't include type declarations.  In
</I>&gt;<i> JScript, you may have type information at compile time, in which case
</I>&gt;<i> the support library operations can often be optimized away.  I haven't
</I>&gt;<i> tried to address that yet in JANET.
</I>
I think that optimizations can wait for the compiler to be complete. 
First we reach full compatibility, then we can look into improving it.

&gt;<i> Slightly off-topic: can anyone point me at a complete specification
</I>&gt;<i> for JScript.NET?  Failing that, is there a reasonably complete
</I>&gt;<i> reference manual that can be used in lieu of a specification?  The
</I>&gt;<i> last time I looked on the Microsoft site (which was a while ago), all
</I>&gt;<i> I could find was a brief &quot;introduction to JScript&quot; -- not very
</I>&gt;<i> satisfying if you're trying to produce your own language
</I>&gt;<i> implementation.
</I>
A wild guess (because I do not have my .NET Framework while traveling),
is that the reference section of the .NET documentation contains it.  I
have seen it for VB and C#.

Miguel.
