</I>I already added the code to CVS. So if you have a CVS account you can 
check it out.
Miguel: Maybe it is also interesting to put janet on the anonymous cvs 
server?

Anyway, I think it's important that you have a look at how I put it in 
CVS and see if you (and Steve) agree on this.
(note that I put JCommand in the Test directory and all other .cs files 
in the janet directory).
I also added 'dummy' Microsft.JScript implementation (throwing not 
implemented things).

Also, watchout for 'local' editing too much, it might mean you will need 
to manually merge things.

As far as I know, I imported the sources directly as been posted by 
Miguel (snapshot from Steve).

I have not made any changes to the janet sources(yet).. instead I have 
submitted two bugs for mcs (so hopefully Miguel or other monkey will 
solve those soon :)

&gt;<i>I don't have a CVS account yet?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>You need to contact Miguel about this (see his email).
