<PRE>Miguel,

What happened to this?  You've been mentioning mono-hackers quite a bit on the 
IRC channel lately and I still have no way of knowing what is going on. Could 
you please set this up or add me too mono-hackers again?

Cheers,

Adam

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For the sake of the non-GNOME people on the list, the exact same
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; brouhaha happened with GNOME. What eventually happened after the uproar
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; died down was, as Adam suggests here, a division of the list into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gnome-hackers and gnome-private. gnome-hackers continued on as a &quot;core
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; development&quot; list[1], and gnome-private faded into the background,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and is not afraid to use it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Okay, I made that last bit up. But the point remains that such a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; division is entirely workable, and Miguel has already been through a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; similar one, and I'm sure he will handle the current situation just as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reasonably.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, when I made mono-hackers and there was a debate a year ago, I
</I>&gt;<i> promised to create a new mailing list (maybe mono-devel-list) which I
</I>&gt;<i> failed to do due to work overload.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The right solution is to create mono-devel-list, I will ask for the list
</I>&gt;<i> to be created, but I am going to Mexico tomorrow morning, and wont have
</I>&gt;<i> time to set it up until Thursday.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Juli has given a good description of why a private mailing list is
</I>&gt;<i> required for an inner group.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best wishes,
