Hi All, 

I gotta say this is a nice friendly list, that is an excellent sign for the 
project you guys are working on.

In view of the number of replies I have recieved answering this question, 
I will try to put together a &quot;digested version&quot; of your answers for any 
lurking newbies who were not prepared to ask.

What I wanted was recomendations on linux friendly books:
_________________________________
For Newbies to programming:

&quot;Thinking in C#&quot; had a few fans, for begginers and above:  

<A HREF="http://www.thinkingin.net/ticsharprc1.htm.">http://www.thinkingin.net/ticsharprc1.htm.</A>  It has a downloadable but 
non-printable version.

O'Reilly publishing  &quot;Programming in C#&quot;

From MS publishing, Inside C# got a big rap...even for the mono platform

Teach Yourself C# in 21 days, has at least one fan
_____________________________________
For the non-newbie, new to C#:
A Programmer's Introduction to C# by Eric Gunnerson was recomended for the 
non-newbie programmer, who might be new to C#...this looks attractive to me, 
though I don't have a heap of coding experience.

______________________________________
There is a nutshell book on the subject, which is probably a good description 
of what the book is likely to give...just the facts (Is this book aimed at 
the experienced programmer?).

<A HREF="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/csharpnut/">http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/csharpnut/</A>

_______________________________________
Unpsecified level of experience:
Professional C# from <A HREF="http://www.wrox.com.">http://www.wrox.com.</A>
Check out the link.  It has a staunch believer, 
the whole book works from a text editor and command prompt...
should suit the linux minded (working on gui development software??:)).

Any way, 

I will hunt one of these down.

Thanks, 

Matt Redding
