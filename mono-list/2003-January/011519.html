These switches don't really belong in the compiler. The compiler is
potentially for use in any environment (Win32, MacOS X) so favouritism
doesn't make sense.

This is a good idea, but it should not be implemented at the runtime
level. Every distribution handles BINFMT_MISC registration in a
different way; for example, Debian uses the binfmt-support registry
system and the Mono Debian packages register with it to achieve the same
effect more elegantly.

This still needs to be implemented with Mono. It will probably need a
hack in the runtime's Reflection.Emit code. Of course since it won't
work on Win32 and C# has no *nix permissions support, it'll have to be
handled as a special case. Any takers?

</I>&gt;<i> I remember reading about a program like that, does it exist?
</I>
The Debian binfmt-misc handler has already been updated to handle this
case. Again, it's a job for distributors like Debian and RedHat rather
than developers like Mono. It needs to be implemented at the platform
level and with the cooperation of several projects.
