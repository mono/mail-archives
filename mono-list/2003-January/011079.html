I'd be quite happy to relicense as LGPL; in fact I would prefer LGPL to X11.  But frankly I'm willing to go either way.  Whichever license will get more people working with/on the code.

This table is correct for janet, with three comments:

* As you suggest, much of the code is in &quot;pretty good shape&quot;, but none of it is completely &quot;done&quot;.

* Only (most of) ECMAScript 3 is implemented, none of the JScript extensions.  (Although, I have implemented a fair amount of runtime support for JavaScript code to use native CLR objects.  This is strictly an aspect of the runtime; there is no CLR-related support in the compiler yet.)

* A few significant features of ECMAScript 3 are still missing, such as regular expressions and &quot;eval&quot;.  (&quot;eval&quot; would be trivial, except that it introduces some special rules for identifier binding in the evaluated code.)

* janet does have something of a test suite -- one 750 line JavaScript file that tries to at least touch every language feature that's been implemented so far.
