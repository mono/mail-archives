</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     2. New Features in this release.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       New Thread Locking
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Zoltan removed the big locks we had in the runtime, and now we have a 
</I>&gt;<i> finely grained lock system in the runtime. Runtime hackers can read 
</I>&gt;<i> the included lock matrix document which describes the requirements to 
</I>&gt;<i> use the new fine grained locks in their code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       Ahead of Time Compiler Optimizations
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Zoltan has worked extensively on the Mono ahead-of-time compilation 
</I>&gt;<i> feature (AOT). The AOT code is now considered to be production 
</I>&gt;<i> quality, and also for the first time precompiled code runs faster than 
</I>&gt;<i> JITed code. This resulted in a 13% compilation speed up for the Mono 
</I>&gt;<i> C# compiler, reducing the compile time to 3.185 seconds. A clear goal 
</I>&gt;<i> of the team for the next release is to reach 3.1416 seconds.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An MCS bug prevents System.dll from being precompiled currently, we 
</I>&gt;<i> hope to fix this by the next release, but everything else should work 
</I>&gt;<i> fine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       Web Services
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now we have a complete Web Services stack in Mono, In this release we 
</I>&gt;<i> added:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     * The WSDL command line tool: this tool is used to generate web
</I>&gt;<i>       service client proxies from a WSDL document (local or remote).
</I>&gt;<i>     * WSDL documents: now ASP.NET can generate a WSDL document for any
</I>&gt;<i>       web service that it hosts.
</I>&gt;<i>     * Web service documentation page: it shows information about the
</I>&gt;<i>       methods of a web service. It also provides a form with which you
</I>&gt;<i>       can test simple methods.
</I>&gt;<i>     * Support for HttpGet and HttpPost protocols.
</I>&gt;<i>     * Our WSDL documentation page (<A HREF="http://.../file.asmx">http://.../file.asmx</A>) also can
</I>&gt;<i>       generate a sample proxy for you, if you don't want to use wsdl.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Notice that the stack was already functional in 0.26, but the addition 
</I>&gt;<i> of the WSDL tools makes the setup complete for developing completely 
</I>&gt;<i> on Mono.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The work to support Web Services was possible thanks to _SourceGear_ 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.sourcegear.com">http://www.sourcegear.com</A>&gt;. We should all send them a token of 
</I>&gt;<i> appreciation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       Xml Serialization
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> New XML serializer generator tool (genxs). With this tool you can 
</I>&gt;<i> generate a XML serializer for any type and customize it to your needs. 
</I>&gt;<i> For details about the use of this tool see Lluis' blog: 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="_http://primates.ximian.com/~lluis/blog/archives/000120.html_">_http://primates.ximian.com/~lluis/blog/archives/000120.html_</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://primates.ximian.com/%7Elluis/blog/archives/000120.html">http://primates.ximian.com/%7Elluis/blog/archives/000120.html</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lots of fixes and improvements to support the WSDL generation and 
</I>&gt;<i> consumption.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       Security
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sebastien has implemented Authenticode(tm) and the code is now part of 
</I>&gt;<i> the distribution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A couple of new tools are available: signcode and chktrust. The former 
</I>&gt;<i> is used to sign assemblies (or any PE files) and the later is used to 
</I>&gt;<i> verify signatures and timestamps.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       Web Service Enhancements
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Implementations of WSE 1.0 and WSE 2.0 appeared on the CVS, thanks to 
</I>&gt;<i> Sebastien, Duncan, Todd and Daniel. We build both assemblies at this 
</I>&gt;<i> point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       XML Improvements
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Speed and memory usage: extensive use of --profile and various clever 
</I>&gt;<i> tricks from Atsushi and Ben. Lots of performance critical classes were 
</I>&gt;<i> improved, and XPathDocument (which is used extensively by XPath and 
</I>&gt;<i> Xslt) uses arrays of structs for its implementation to improve 
</I>&gt;<i> performance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> XML Schema validation support in now in XmlValidatingReader (although 
</I>&gt;<i> it is not finished). It also means that now many schema component 
</I>&gt;<i> constraints have been implemented.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       Remoting
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Added support for CallContext. Now the CallContext is sent through 
</I>&gt;<i> remoting boundaries and fixed various problems related to in/out 
</I>&gt;<i> parameters in Remoting invocations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Improved robustness, specially for asynchronous calls.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       Generics
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Work continues on supporting generics: more changes have been done to 
</I>&gt;<i> the runtime, class libraries and tools, but we are not complete.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To build the generic version of Mono, you have to compile the code 
</I>&gt;<i> from source, and build the class libraries with the `generics' profile 
</I>&gt;<i> (make PROFILE=generics). The generics C# compiler is called `gmcs' and 
</I>&gt;<i> not `mcs'. They will merge in the future, but we wanted to maintain 
</I>&gt;<i> mcs robust, and do all of our experimentation on a separate branch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       XSLT Managed Engine
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Over the past month, Ben's Managed XSLT engine has grown by leaps and 
</I>&gt;<i> bounds. The implementation now offers compliance in critical areas 
</I>&gt;<i> such as template conflict resolution. It also implements all of the 
</I>&gt;<i> XSLT elements, including xsl:number. All of the extension functions 
</I>&gt;<i> with the exception of format-number have also been implemented.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oleg Tkachenko, a seasoned .NET developer, joined Ben in his efforts 
</I>&gt;<i> on XSLT, working on making the design of outputting XSLT much better. 
</I>&gt;<i> His work will allow for better compliance with the spec, greatly 
</I>&gt;<i> improved speed, and support for mode=&quot;html&quot; for xsl:output.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The work of all the XSLT hackers has resulted in a major rewarded, in 
</I>&gt;<i> many cases the managed engine is faster than the C based libxslt.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although the Managed XSLT provider is still not the default provider, 
</I>&gt;<i> you can enable it by setting the MONO_MANAGED_XSLT environment 
</I>&gt;<i> variable, like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>	export MONO_MANAGED_XSLT=true
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       PowerPC Runtime
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Progress on the PowerPC JIT engine, but the full engine did not make 
</I>&gt;<i> it into the 0.28 release, it should still be available before the 
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft PDC.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       Windows.Forms
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We got a nice upgrade from Vladimir at _OpenLink_ 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.openlinksw.com">http://www.openlinksw.com</A>&gt; for WineLib: various new DLLs from the 
</I>&gt;<i> Wine runtime are now available (in particular all the common dialog 
</I>&gt;<i> routines are now available to us). Vladimir is currently working on 
</I>&gt;<i> updating WineLib to the latest edition of Wine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Jordi Mas contributed the ListViewItem widget and the file dialog and 
</I>&gt;<i> Jonathan Hogg contributed a few fixes to the code base as well. Brian 
</I>&gt;<i> Takita contributed the List control.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alexandre Pigolkine continued fixing the various low-level controls to 
</I>&gt;<i> have the same rendering behavior that they do have on Windows together 
</I>&gt;<i> with Jerome Laban. We started a thread to discuss the future 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation strategy for System.Drawing to be fully cross-platform.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dennis continues in his quest to fix all the signatures in the 
</I>&gt;<i> Windows.Forms. Johannes added support to make Wine track the theme 
</I>&gt;<i> settings of Gnome (we will fully complete this on the next release).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> System.Drawing now has migrated to use Cairo bindings on Unix.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       IL Assembler
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Jackson was in charge of most of these improvements. New features in 
</I>&gt;<i> this release: .data, p/invoke support, allow multiple constraints on 
</I>&gt;<i> generic parameters, Oberon is now self hosting with our il assembler 
</I>&gt;<i> and plenty of bugs fixed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       JScript and Vsa
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cesar has picked up again on JScript and has done incredible progress 
</I>&gt;<i> on JScript and the Vsa engine, still not ready for hello world, but 
</I>&gt;<i> moving along.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       Bug Fixing
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you can expect bug fixes everywhere: ASP.NET server and client, 
</I>&gt;<i> ADO.NET, memory leak fixes. The client side for web services is 
</I>&gt;<i> extremely robust (we passed the 24-hour continous test from SourceGear 
</I>&gt;<i> and fixed tons of memory leaks, performance issues and stability 
</I>&gt;<i> problems).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We hope to bring the same level of robustness to the server side 
</I>&gt;<i> component
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     3. The people behind this release
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The following developers contributed to this release:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alejandro Sanchez, Alexandre Pigolkine, Alp Toker, Atsushi Enomoto, 
</I>&gt;<i> Ben Maurer, Bernie Solomon, Bernie Solomon, Cesar Octavio Lopez

Mono 0.28 Release&lt;br&gt;
Hello everyone,&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
A new release of the &lt;a href=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com"">http://www.go-mono.com&quot;</A>&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mono&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
runtime and SDK is available for UNIX and Windows. Packages for various
distributions are also available from our download page.&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
Since the last release, 1,124 individual commits were done to our
runtime and class libraries.&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
144 bugzilla bugs were closed.&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
I know that the following summary is incomplete, I apologize for
missing major features&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
We have finished the SourceGear &lt;a
 href=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.ximian.com/about_us/press_center/press_releases/index.html?pr=sourcegear"">http://www.ximian.com/about_us/press_center/press_releases/index.html?pr=sourcegear&quot;</A>&gt;&lt;u&gt;contract&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
which funded Web Services in Mono as well as various improvements in
the runtime. We are very happy to have served our first customer, and
we will continue to improve Mono to make sure the &lt;a
 href=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/"">http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/&quot;</A>&gt;&lt;u&gt;Vault software&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; runs
flawlessly on Mono. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
As you can expect, this release features bug fixes everywhere: memory
leaks plugged, performance problems solved, performance improvements

component: it is extremely robust now, as one of the SourceGear
acceptance criteria was a 24-hour continuous test of their client

  &lt;br&gt;
We hope to bring the same level of robustness to the server side
component in the next release, the &lt;a class=&quot;moz-txt-link-abbreviated&quot; href=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com"">http://www.go-mono.com&quot;</A>&gt;www.go-mono.com&lt;/a&gt; site &lt;a

is currently running with Mono and our ASP.NET implementation (that is
why the site has gone down a few times: we were using it on our
production system to use it under stress). &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
Each new release of Mono opens the door for more abusive tests, and
this time is not an exception, we already have a few areas of
performance and scalability that we want to address for the next
release.

Source code for Mono, MCS, XSP and mod_mono are also available from our
web site&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;MCS package (Class Libraries, C# and VB.NET compiler and
managed tools):&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mcs-0.28.tar.gz"">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mcs-0.28.tar.gz&quot;</A>&gt;&lt;u&gt;<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mcs-0.28.tar.gz</u">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mcs-0.28.tar.gz&lt;/u</A>&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Mono package (Runtime engine, JIT compiler, pre-compiled
compiler and class libraries):&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-0.28.tar.gz"">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-0.28.tar.gz&quot;</A>&gt;&lt;u&gt;<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-0.28.tar.gz</u">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-0.28.tar.gz&lt;/u</A>&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Apache Mono Module and XSP runtime (needed for the Apache
module):&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mod_mono-0.4.tar.gz"">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mod_mono-0.4.tar.gz&quot;</A>&gt;&lt;u&gt;<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mod_mono-0.5.tar.gz</u">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mod_mono-0.5.tar.gz&lt;/u</A>&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/xsp-0.5.tar.gz"">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/xsp-0.5.tar.gz&quot;</A>&gt;<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/xsp-0.6.tar.gz</a">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/xsp-0.6.tar.gz&lt;/a</A>&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;2. New Features in this release.&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;New Thread Locking&lt;/h3&gt;
Zoltan removed the big locks we had in the runtime, and now we have a
finely grained lock system in the runtime. Runtime hackers can read the
included lock matrix document which describes the requirements to use
the new fine grained locks in their code.
  &lt;h3&gt;Ahead of Time Compiler Optimizations&lt;/h3&gt;
Zoltan has worked extensively on the Mono ahead-of-time compilation
feature (AOT). The AOT code is now considered to be production quality,
and also for the first time precompiled code runs faster than JITed
code. This resulted in a 13% compilation speed up for the Mono C#
compiler, reducing the compile time to 3.185 seconds. A clear goal of
the team for the next release is to reach 3.1416 seconds. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
An MCS bug prevents System.dll from being precompiled currently, we
hope to fix this by the next release, but everything else should work
fine.
  &lt;h3&gt;Web Services&lt;/h3&gt;
Now we have a complete Web Services stack in Mono, In this release we
added:
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The WSDL command line tool: this tool is used to generate web
service client proxies from a WSDL document (local or remote). &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;WSDL documents: now ASP.NET can generate a WSDL document for
any web service that it hosts. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Web service documentation page: it shows information about the
methods of a web service. It also provides a form with which you can
test simple methods. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Support for HttpGet and HttpPost protocols. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Our WSDL documentation page (&lt;a class=&quot;moz-txt-link-freetext&quot; href=&quot;<A HREF="http://.../file.asmx"">http://.../file.asmx&quot;</A>&gt;<A HREF="http://.../file.asmx</a">http://.../file.asmx&lt;/a</A>&gt;) also can
generate a sample proxy for you, if you don't want to use wsdl. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
Notice that the stack was already functional in 0.26, but the addition
of the WSDL tools makes the setup complete for developing completely on
Mono. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
The work to support Web Services was possible thanks to &lt;a
 href=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.sourcegear.com"">http://www.sourcegear.com&quot;</A>&gt;&lt;u&gt;SourceGear&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We should all
send them a token of appreciation.
  &lt;h3&gt;Xml Serialization&lt;/h3&gt;
New XML serializer generator tool (genxs). With this tool you can
generate a XML serializer for any type and customize it to your needs.
For details about the use of this tool see Lluis' blog: &lt;a
 href=&quot;<A HREF="http://primates.ximian.com/%7Elluis/blog/archives/000120.html"">http://primates.ximian.com/%7Elluis/blog/archives/000120.html&quot;</A>&gt;&lt;u&gt;<A HREF="http://primates.ximian.com/~lluis/blog/archives/000120.html</u">http://primates.ximian.com/~lluis/blog/archives/000120.html&lt;/u</A>&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
Lots of fixes and improvements to support the WSDL generation and
consumption.
  &lt;h3&gt;Security&lt;/h3&gt;
Sebastien has implemented Authenticode(tm) and the code is now part of
the distribution. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
A couple of new tools are available: signcode and chktrust. The former
is used to sign assemblies (or any PE files) and the later is used to
verify signatures and timestamps.
  &lt;h3&gt;Web Service Enhancements&lt;/h3&gt;
Implementations of WSE 1.0 and WSE 2.0 appeared on the CVS, thanks to
Sebastien, Duncan, Todd and Daniel. We build both assemblies at this
point.
  &lt;h3&gt;XML Improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
Speed and memory usage: extensive use of --profile and various clever
tricks from Atsushi and Ben. Lots of performance critical classes were
improved, and XPathDocument (which is used extensively by XPath and
Xslt) uses arrays of structs for its implementation to improve
performance. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
XML Schema validation support in now in XmlValidatingReader (although
it is not finished). It also means that now many schema component
constraints have been implemented.
  &lt;h3&gt;Remoting&lt;/h3&gt;
Added support for CallContext. Now the CallContext is sent through
remoting boundaries and fixed various problems related to in/out
parameters in Remoting invocations. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
Improved robustness, specially for asynchronous calls.
  &lt;h3&gt;Generics&lt;/h3&gt;
Work continues on supporting generics: more changes have been done to
the runtime, class libraries and tools, but we are not complete. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
To build the generic version of Mono, you have to compile the code from
source, and build the class libraries with the `generics' profile (make
PROFILE=generics). The generics C# compiler is called `gmcs' and not
`mcs'. They will merge in the future, but we wanted to maintain mcs
robust, and do all of our experimentation on a separate branch.
  &lt;h3&gt;XSLT Managed Engine&lt;/h3&gt;
Over the past month, Ben's Managed XSLT engine has grown by leaps and
bounds. The implementation now offers compliance in critical areas such
as template conflict resolution. It also implements all of the XSLT
elements, including xsl:number. All of the extension functions with the
exception of format-number have also been implemented. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
Oleg Tkachenko, a seasoned .NET developer, joined Ben in his efforts on
XSLT, working on making the design of outputting XSLT much better. His
work will allow for better compliance with the spec, greatly improved
speed, and support for mode=&quot;html&quot; for xsl:output. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
The work of all the XSLT hackers has resulted in a major rewarded, in
many cases the managed engine is faster than the C based libxslt. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
Although the Managed XSLT provider is still not the default provider,
you can enable it by setting the MONO_MANAGED_XSLT environment
variable, like this:
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;pre&gt;	export MONO_MANAGED_XSLT=true&lt;/pre&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;PowerPC Runtime&lt;/h3&gt;
Progress on the PowerPC JIT engine, but the full engine did not make it
into the 0.28 release, it should still be available before the
Microsoft PDC.
  &lt;h3&gt;Windows.Forms&lt;/h3&gt;
We got a nice upgrade from Vladimir at &lt;a
 href=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.openlinksw.com"">http://www.openlinksw.com&quot;</A>&gt;&lt;u&gt;OpenLink&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for WineLib:
various new DLLs from the Wine runtime are now available (in particular
all the common dialog routines are now available to us). Vladimir is
currently working on updating WineLib to the latest edition of Wine. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
Jordi Mas contributed the ListViewItem widget and the file dialog and
Jonathan Hogg contributed a few fixes to the code base as well. Brian
Takita contributed the List control. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
Alexandre Pigolkine continued fixing the various low-level controls to
have the same rendering behavior that they do have on Windows together
with Jerome Laban. We started a thread to discuss the future
implementation strategy for System.Drawing to be fully cross-platform. &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
Dennis continues in his quest to fix all the signatures in the
Windows.Forms. Johannes added support to make Wine track the theme
settings of Gnome (we will fully complete this on the next release). &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
System.Drawing now has migrated to use Cairo bindings on Unix.
  &lt;h3&gt;IL Assembler&lt;/h3&gt;
Jackson was in charge of most of these improvements. New features in
this release: .data, p/invoke support, allow multiple constraints on
generic parameters, Oberon is now self hosting with our il assembler
and plenty of bugs fixed.
  &lt;h3&gt;JScript and Vsa&lt;/h3&gt;
Cesar has picked up again on JScript and has done incredible progress
on JScript and the Vsa engine, still not ready for hello world, but
moving along.
  &lt;h3&gt;Bug Fixing&lt;/h3&gt;
As you can expect bug fixes everywhere: ASP.NET server and client,
ADO.NET, memory leak fixes. The client side for web services is
extremely robust (we passed the 24-hour continous test from SourceGear
and fixed tons of memory leaks, performance issues and stability
problems). &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
We hope to bring the same level of robustness to the server side
component

This list is not complete, it is missing contributions that were sent
to the list, as it was very hard to track the two million incremental
line patch since the last release (lots of documentation, thats why
;-).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
