<PRE>Rafael,
the NAnt makefile has been re-organised since 0.8.3. I think you'll find 
that the current cvs builds much more smoothly. There is no mininant 
anymore - just run make in the nant basedir. You'll probably still need 
to tweak the config file as by default it expects mono to reside in 
/usr/local.

If you want to keep NAnt.exe in a seperate directory to the task 
assemblies then you can add /usr/lib to the 

&lt;nant taskpath=&quot;&quot;&gt;  attribute in NAnt.Exe.config  and NAnt will look 
there for task assemblies. Note this is a ';' seperated list.

I can't speak of other projects but we ( nant developers ) will 
definately accept patches for mono friendliness. Feel free to post 
patches/comments to <A HREF="mailto:nant-developers@lists.sourceforge.net.">nant-developers@lists.sourceforge.net.</A>
I would prefer that the NAnt cvs tree is as mono friendly as possible 
rather than having a forked version in the mono tree. Of course - 
shipping a version of NAnt with mono releases would be a great help for 
new users.

btw I offered to submit patches to the NUnit project for mono 
friendliness. Waiting on a response now.

which code did you need to comment out in resgentask.cs ?

Ian

&gt;<i> Well, I had to fiddle with the mininant makefile, had to copy/rename 
</I>&gt;<i> dll from log4net-1.2.0-beta8, had to create an mininant.exe.config and 
</I>&gt;<i> make changes in NAnt.exe.config (not yet on the source it is 
</I>&gt;<i> compiled), and NAnt 8.3 runs, but:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had to keep NAnt.exe in /usr/lib/ with NAnt.*Tasks.dll assemblies or 
</I>&gt;<i> it would not find the tasks (mono linux-friendly separation of exes 
</I>&gt;<i> and dlls, plays havoc with NAnt autoconfigurable factories...). I may 
</I>&gt;<i> have missed some setting that would help with that but...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had to uncomment code on resgentask.cs, for it to work correctly in 
</I>&gt;<i> linux, as needed for next step
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then I built NUnit 2.1.4 using NAnt, with a shortened buildfile 
</I>&gt;<i> (avoiding SWF dependencies)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;output&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
