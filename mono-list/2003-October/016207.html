<PRE>* What should Mono 1.0 be?

Well I got another point to consider about the time of release, like the
quality and quantity of proper documentation. Even if we have a good
chunk of the framwork in 1.0 status I really think is vital to have good
docs in conjuction to them. Why? because my feeling is that many people
are waiting for a 1.0 release of Mono:: to jump and use the framework,
so the relevance of good docs so the acceptance and release of 1.0 goes
smooth and quick. Otherwise we can expect a big wave of persons in the
mailing lists looking for info that the docs should have, well that's
IMHO. Thankfully we are in a good position with monkeyguide, monodoc,
etc but need a extra push for a 1.0 release.=20

*When and where should we do a Mono developer summit.
Well I don't see why we can't have the 'big room with internet access,
printers and laptops=C2=B4 type of summit inside the formal type of summit.
So I will go with the formal summit.

Location:

Oh tough one, I will say: no in Europe please, and finally i answer with
a question: If a get the facilities and blessing from my university
(UNAM, FC, Mexico) how great are the chances that the summit will be
done there?
