That's out of line and you should apologise.  It was based on a careful 
analysis of the API's and other similar API's in the past (MFC of 10 years 
ago does everything that you listed as &quot;massive departures&quot;).

In any case, it has already been made clear in this thread that we are hedging 
our bets: we'll switch to Qt# or Gtk# in a heartbeat should Microsoft 
disagree with our analysis.  What?  We can't have it both ways?

If you have no interest in co-operating with us in a productive and 
non-hostile fashion, why don't you just say so?  Attacking our judgement is 
hardly conducive to a productive working relationship.

I suspect that the real problem here is that you desperately don't want 
Windows.Forms to succeed (either Mono's or pnet's).  Because who in the world 
would use Gtk# if Windows.Forms applications worked everywhere?

Cheers,

Rhys.
