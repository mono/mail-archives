That is a misrepresentation of my position.  My position is that
besides the stuff in ECMA there are also other areas of the .NET
API concerning which it is possible to say with confidence that
MS will not be able to enforce the API patent, even if that will
be granted, and that System.Windows.Forms is an _example_ of such
a not-patent-endangered API.

Besides claiming that my view is wrong,  Mono project leader
Miguel de Icaza has also provided an answer of 'no' to my
suggestion of collaboration.  (Maybe this was not said explicitly,
but that he chose to repond by insulting me makes the 'no' clear
enough.)

As far as I am concerned, there is no point in continuing the
&quot;Collaboration on alternatives to the US-patent-endangered APIs&quot;
discussion.

Both projects will continue to work along the lines of the
strategies they have chosen.

I hereby ask for all verbal attacks or FUD from Free Software /
&quot;open source&quot; projects against other such projects over legal
matters to stop immediately.  This kind of attacks is what one may
expect from monopolistic companies, but we should not attack each
other.

Already bickering or any kind of heated public discussion of these
matters is not wise at all; it will only lead to statements which
can later be quoted out-of-context by the enemies of Free Software.

Greetings, Norbert.
