<PRE>I like the == example better than the switch example--because that's 
what toString() is for ;-)

Thanks for the examples...

Implicit and explicit have become clearer in my mind, which is what the 
book I was reading didn't accomplish.

</I>&gt;<i>Thanks for the explanation.  I can see how the implicit operator can be
</I>&gt;<i>useful in the example you describe; still, I think it wasn't necessary
</I>&gt;<i>for C# to expose them to us.  I.e., let us deal with the explicit casts
</I>&gt;<i>and spare the confusion they may cause.  In other words, an implicit
</I>&gt;<i>cast from a Pear object to a Truck object can seem quite odd, assuming
</I>&gt;<i>their inheritance tree has nothing in common.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>You expect the following code to work:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>	int n = 42;
</I>&gt;<i>	long l = n;
</I>&gt;<i>	short s = (short) n;

</I>&gt;<i>	System.Int32 n = 42;
</I>&gt;<i>	System.Int64 l = n;
</I>&gt;<i>	System.Int16 s = (System.Int16) n;

</I>&gt;<i>Which means that the managed implementation of those managed types needs

</I>&gt;<i>explicitly).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>C#'s implicit/explicit operators are how this is declared and defined.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>As for the differences between implicit &amp; explicit, you understand the
</I>&gt;<i>difference already.  Implicit == doesn't need a cast; explicit ==
</I>&gt;<i>requires a cast.
