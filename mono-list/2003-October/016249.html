<PRE>Guys,

Here's my 2 cents for what it's worth.  It would be great if Mono 1.0
contained the most important bits of MS.NET, which would mean everything
bar the bits that rely on Windows Architectural features, which would
probably mean loosing the following namespaces:

System.DirectoryServices
System.EnterpriseServices
System.EnterpriseServices.CompensatingResourceManager 
System.Management
System.Management.Instrumentation
System.Messaging
System.Windows.Forms
System.Windows.Forms.Design

In my mind the most important thing is that Mono 1.0 comes with some
reasonable documentation (which I guess there'll be no problems with)
and is pretty damned sturdy.  

I know when MS.NET 1.0 came out it was a quality bit of kit and I would
definitely like to think that Mono 1.0 could likewise be pretty
reliable.  While there is the OS maxim of release frequently to
consider, it'd be really great if Mono 1.0 was given a decent test
period before release, to fix all the potential show stoppers like
ASP.NET's dodgy installation issues.

In regards to the Mono Summit of Love I think it's a great idea,
although there's a third question to ask which is when should it be?
The marketer in me says it'd be great (if not logistically impossible)
for it to coincide with Mono 1.0's launch, but as to what that means,
search me...

Audience wise it'd be great to fill the place with hackers, but I really
think there should be a broader agenda, which would involve getting in
the big boys and having formal presentations and cheap beer.  If most of
the big boys don't want to come then that's fine, although I can't see
the show working without sponsorship from Budweiser.  

I know this won't go down well, but, if at all possible, it'd be
interesting to see if the Beast would want a stand.  I know I shouldn't
mention such things, but if they were interested in coming along it
would add a certain spark of credence to the Mono community and would
probably be in MS's interest as they're dying to show the world how kick
ass .NET is at cross-platform stuff.

Location wise I'd vote on Spain, which has nothing to do with the fact
that I've personally just started a project out there, and everything to
do with the innate beauty of the Spanish senoritas.

Mark

Subject: [Mono-devel-list] Surveys: Mono 1.0 and Mono Conference.

Hey guys,

   I want to query the community, and find out about two things:

	* What should Mono 1.0 be?

	* When and where should we do a Mono developer summit.



* Mono 1.0

	Mono is rapidly approaching maturity in various of its class
        libraries, the question in everyone's minds is: is it worth
        waiting for the full .net framework implementation to be ready
        to publish 1.0, or is a subset fine?
        
        Mono 1.0 so far is going to be a subset, and my current thinking
        is `.NET 1.0 minus two major pieces: EnterpriseServices and
        Windows.Forms'.
        
        But today some people suggested that we might want to have a
        Mono 1.0 release earlier by committing to less than that,
        something like: 
        
        Mono 1.0: 
        	C# compiler
        	Toolchain (ilasm, ildasm, al, etc)
        	corlib, System, System.XML, System.Security.
        	ADO.NET (System.Data and providers)
        	ASP.NET (System.Web.Services and System.Web)
        
        Anything else that is robust by the time the other components
        are deemed &quot;stable&quot; would also make it.  So if for example
        &quot;System.Wasabinator&quot; is of 1.0 quality by the time the rest is
        done, we can also include it. 
        
        We would later publish the other components in upcoming
        releases:
        
        	JScript, VB.NET (compiler and runtimes)
        	System.DirectoryServices
        	System.EnterpriseServices
        	System.Windows.Forms
        
* Mono Conference (Code name: Mono Summit of Love).

        Gnome has been fairly successful at running yearly conferences
        for users and developers.   And these face to face meetings are
        fantastic to improve the collaboration between the various parts
        of the project, and help to go over development bumps rather
        quickly.
        
        Also, it is great to put faces and voices to nicknames and email
        addresses. 
        
        So am thinking that we need to have a such a summit.  There are
        two questions: what is the audience for this summit and where
        should we base it.
        
        Audience:
        
                We can certainly make this a hacker-only conference, but
                given the amount of projects, companies and developers
                using Mono, it might make sense to have something with a
                larger scope.
                
                In one extreme we have the `big room with internet
                access, printers and laptops' and in the other we have
                something more formal including presentations on
                specific technologies, tutorials and workshops. 
                
                I know active Mono developers would like to come (and am
                working on getting the funding to pay for airfares and
                hotels for those who can not afford a trip to the other
                end of the world).
                
        Location:
        
                I suggested Cancun during summer break, but Nat quickly
                pointed out that if you are working for a company, there
                was no way your boss would authorize such a thing.
                
                So here are the parameters:
                
                	* If we are getting many latin-americans/asians,
                	  we should do it in a country that does not
                	  require VISAs, so that rules out the US and
                	  Brasil.
                
                	* If we are getting mostly US citizens,
                	  Europeans that are under the VISA waiver
                	  program and just a few foreigners, we might
                	  consider the US.
                
                My choice would be to pick a cheap city, rather than an
                expensive one, and one that has good airport
                connectivity to minimize airfare cost, for case A we
                have:
                
                	* Cancun, Mexico.
                
                	* Barcelona, Spain
                
                For case B we could probably do Boston, unless some
                University wants to step up and provide some facilities.
                
Love, Love, Love,
Miguel.
