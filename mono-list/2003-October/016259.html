<PRE>&gt;<i> My thinking is something along the March-May 2004 lines.
</I>
Ok, with those dates in mind, we should now worry about our target
audience, and where they are coming from (both geographically and
socially).

I think date and audience identification, as well as attempting to
estimate a size of the gathering are definitely required to be known
before you even attempt to pick a city/country/town/whatever.

For example, if we wanted this to be a small hackers only conference, we
have far more leeway I think in deciding where it will take place.

If we were going for a huge mono conference/summit thing, then obviously
we couldn't do this in some cool small town in
Spain/Brazil/US/Canada/wherever, because the town itself couldn't
support that.

As well, wrt to it being a larger conference, if we are looking to line
up some sort of potential sponsorship/vendor stuff, then the location is
of supreme importance. Obviously certain companies would be more or less
interested in the conference depending on the location for a number of
reasons.
