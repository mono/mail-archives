<PRE>As a NAnt user I'll try to answer some questions (Ian - please correct me if
I'm wrong)

&gt;<i> * Using XML to express the build rules is, IMO, too heavyweight.
</I>&gt;<i>   I can see how it's easy to parse and gives an easy mechanism
</I>&gt;<i>   for interfacing with tasks, but writing a build file is like
</I>&gt;<i>     programming in any other language; it's better to have the
</I>&gt;<i>   common bits easy and the rare bits hard than everything
</I>&gt;<i>   somewhere in an awkward medium.
</I>
For most tasks it's ultra-readable, and 99% of the time I can write
NAnt buildfiles without the docs (they are just that obvious).
You can use *.xsd schema and use xml editors (xmlspy, VS.NET) to
provide auto-completion.

&gt;<i> * The replacement of shell commands with tasks is important,   of
</I>&gt;<i> course, but the commands still seem on the low-level side
</I>&gt;<i>   of things: copy file, delete file, compile to this file; what
</I>&gt;<i>   happens if I'm compiling foo.so on Linux and foo.dll on
</I>&gt;<i>   Windows?
</I>
&lt;copy&gt;, &lt;delete&gt; are there. As for compiling to *.so vs *.dll using C
compiler
- it should possible to have it (with maybe a small change), but
is it really necessary for compilation of pure-C# applications,
which we're discussing right now.

&gt;<i> * I haven't seen indications that it's particularly aware of
</I>&gt;<i>   recursion.
</I>
Yes it is. And there's a standard way to invoke sub-build optionally passing
it a modified set of properties.

&gt;<i> * It looks like you can implement tasks in user assemblies but I
</I>&gt;<i>   don't see a framework for distributing them sanely (which
</I>&gt;<i>   I believe to be very important: aclocal, anyone?)
</I>
In 99% you shouldn't need this. I agree that it may be necessary for some
cases.

&gt;<i> * Similarly, it doesn't look like you can define tasks in the
</I>&gt;<i>   XML itself.
</I>
You can't. What would the XML tasks do?

&gt;<i> * You still have to write your own clean rules and dist rules.
</I>&gt;<i>   Surely the tool, knowing the targets and all the rules used
</I>&gt;<i>   to build them, could figure this out by itself?
</I>
Yes. However NAnt employs a technique known as &quot;named filesets&quot;
where you can have a set of files and pass them to various tasks (like
&lt;copy&gt;, &lt;delete&gt;, &lt;csc&gt;) which makes the clean and dist targets simple.

&gt;<i> * Still using file modtimes, not MD5 sums, as criteria for
</I>&gt;<i>   rebuilding. Not the end of the world, but if you change a
</I>&gt;<i>   comment in a C file and have to relink your executable
</I>&gt;<i>   as a result, it can be a drag.
</I>
In C# there's no concept of relinking, you always recompile everything.
If you're talking about referencing assemblies: be advised that C# compiler
is forced to put a GUID (globally unique identifier) into the dll/exe output
on each compilation. So a comment change would definitely produce a
different MD5.

As for C/C++ I'm not sure if the C compiler would be so kind to produce
exactly
the same  object file when you change/remove the comment? How about some
embedded dates or debug information?

&gt;<i> * Judging from idea of build properties, configuration state
</I>&gt;<i>   is still kept outside of the build tool.
</I>
Configuration specific to the nant installation (like paths to the CLI
runtime
and SDK) is kept in nant.exe.config, everything else is inside the *.build
file.
If you want, you can reference external files' contents from the build file.

&gt;<i> NAnt seems to improve on the implementation of make while still working
</I>&gt;<i> within the same basic framework. My opinion is that there's a lot to be
</I>&gt;<i> gained from really rethinking what it means to &quot;build&quot; something and
</I>&gt;<i> structuring the process a lot more.
</I>
I agree. I think that there should be something like &quot;NAnt Buildfile
Standard&quot;
which would work for 90% cases. Currently NAnt leaves too much room for your
own inventions which isn't always very good.

&gt;<i> To try to articulate that idea a bit more, here's a quote from the NAnt
</I>&gt;<i> webpage that struck me:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Important: Some tasks like the compiler tasks will only execute
</I>&gt;<i>         if the date stamp of the generated file is older than the source
</I>&gt;<i>         files.  If you compile HelloWorld project in debug mode and then
</I>&gt;<i>         try to compile it again in non-debug mode without first cleaning
</I>&gt;<i>         nothing will happen because NAnt will think the project does not
</I>&gt;<i>         need rebuilding.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why isn't NAnt able to figure that out? It's a build tool, it should
</I>&gt;<i> specialize in being smart in situations like this. Problems like this
</I>&gt;<i> are why make sucks, but it doesn't seem that NAnt improves the
</I>&gt;<i> situation.
</I>
NAnt is no different than make here: it compares the timestamps of all input
files
against the time of all output files. Because the configuration &quot;debug&quot; vs
&quot;release&quot;
is not associated with any file, nothing will get rebuilt.

This could be easily changed by creating a temporary file and introducing a
dependency
on this file. I'm not sure if this is any better than the current, clean
approach.
