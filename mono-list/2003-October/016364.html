<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> I would like to contribute on a regular basis to the Mono project.  I've read 
</I>&gt;<i> the documentation, written some console based apps with Mono and had a look 
</I>&gt;<i> around the source code.  I've also been programming in a professional 
</I>&gt;<i> environment using C# .NET (MS-Windows) for about a year and I am excited by 
</I>&gt;<i> Mono and would love to get involved.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to do some unit testing to start with or maybe some 
</I>&gt;<i> documentation, but I was wondering which sections / classes need testing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Could anyone please point me in the right direction?
</I>
