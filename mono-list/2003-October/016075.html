Yes, the NAnt.*Tasks.dll must be kept in the same dir as NAnt.exe. Many
people use NAnt directly from its directory and don't install it
somewhere else. Just change PATH and library path.

I didn't need that with NAnt-cvs. I did a _make_ after editing 
&lt;nant root&gt;\src\NAnt.Console\NAnt.Console.exe.config.linux and changing
3 PATH directives. In the CVS version they now have much better support
for *NIX.
