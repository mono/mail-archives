My 1.5 cents. :)

Why a monolithic release?
We have some very different types of technology in mono. As such, why
not release a few different packages. Maybe at the same time for a
general 1.0 release or possibly separately as they mature. For example,
if the mono core is done but asp.net is not, why wait for asp.net?

1. The core stuff. The JIT, meta data libs, and class libraries.
This is really the heart of mono and will be needed for everything else.

2. ASP.NET (Web stuff)
Not necessary for non web builders. What percentage of machines have
apache on them? I don't think Microsoft is going to go after mono over
asp, but if they do, it would be good for them to target the asp stuff
directly rather then all of mono.

3. GTK# (Gui stuff)
Why install GTK# on your web server? I know my web servers don't have X
on them, so I'd rather not download it on that system.

4. mcs, mbas, monodis, ilasm, etc (Development stuff)
These tools are only useful to developers. Most users wont ever need
them, so why have them install them?

&gt;<i> 	Mono is rapidly approaching maturity in various of its class
</I>&gt;<i>         libraries, the question in everyone's minds is: is it worth
</I>&gt;<i>         waiting for the full .net framework implementation to be ready
</I>&gt;<i>         to publish 1.0, or is a subset fine?
</I>&gt;<i>        =20
</I>&gt;<i>         Mono 1.0 so far is going to be a subset, and my current thinking
</I>&gt;<i>         is `.NET 1.0 minus two major pieces: EnterpriseServices and
</I>&gt;<i>         Windows.Forms'.
</I>&gt;<i>        =20
</I>&gt;<i>         But today some people suggested that we might want to have a
</I>&gt;<i>         Mono 1.0 release earlier by committing to less than that,
</I>&gt;<i>         something like:=20
</I>&gt;<i>        =20
</I>&gt;<i>         Mono 1.0:=20
</I>&gt;<i>         	C# compiler
</I>&gt;<i>         	Toolchain (ilasm, ildasm, al, etc)
</I>&gt;<i>         	corlib, System, System.XML, System.Security.
</I>&gt;<i>         	ADO.NET (System.Data and providers)
</I>&gt;<i>         	ASP.NET (System.Web.Services and System.Web)
</I>&gt;<i>        =20
</I>&gt;<i>         Anything else that is robust by the time the other components
</I>&gt;<i>         are deemed &quot;stable&quot; would also make it.  So if for example
</I>&gt;<i>         &quot;System.Wasabinator&quot; is of 1.0 quality by the time the rest is
</I>&gt;<i>         done, we can also include it.=20
</I>&gt;<i>        =20
</I>&gt;<i>         We would later publish the other components in upcoming
</I>&gt;<i>         releases:
</I>&gt;<i>        =20
</I>&gt;<i>         	JScript, VB.NET (compiler and runtimes)
</I>&gt;<i>         	System.DirectoryServices
</I>&gt;<i>         	System.EnterpriseServices
</I>&gt;<i>         	System.Windows.Forms
</I>&gt;<i>        =20
</I>&gt;<i> * Mono Conference (Code name: Mono Summit of Love).
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i>         Gnome has been fairly successful at running yearly conferences
</I>&gt;<i>         for users and developers.   And these face to face meetings are
</I>&gt;<i>         fantastic to improve the collaboration between the various parts
</I>&gt;<i>         of the project, and help to go over development bumps rather
</I>&gt;<i>         quickly.
</I>&gt;<i>        =20
</I>&gt;<i>         Also, it is great to put faces and voices to nicknames and email
</I>&gt;<i>         addresses.=20
</I>&gt;<i>        =20
</I>&gt;<i>         So am thinking that we need to have a such a summit.  There are
</I>&gt;<i>         two questions: what is the audience for this summit and where
</I>&gt;<i>         should we base it.
</I>&gt;<i>        =20
</I>&gt;<i>         Audience:
</I>&gt;<i>        =20
</I>&gt;<i>                 We can certainly make this a hacker-only conference, but
</I>&gt;<i>                 given the amount of projects, companies and developers
</I>&gt;<i>                 using Mono, it might make sense to have something with a
</I>&gt;<i>                 larger scope.
</I>&gt;<i>                =20
</I>&gt;<i>                 In one extreme we have the `big room with internet
</I>&gt;<i>                 access, printers and laptops' and in the other we have
</I>&gt;<i>                 something more formal including presentations on
</I>&gt;<i>                 specific technologies, tutorials and workshops.=20
</I>&gt;<i>                =20
</I>&gt;<i>                 I know active Mono developers would like to come (and am
</I>&gt;<i>                 working on getting the funding to pay for airfares and
</I>&gt;<i>                 hotels for those who can not afford a trip to the other
</I>&gt;<i>                 end of the world).
</I>&gt;<i>                =20
</I>&gt;<i>         Location:
</I>&gt;<i>        =20
</I>&gt;<i>                 I suggested Cancun during summer break, but Nat quickly
</I>&gt;<i>                 pointed out that if you are working for a company, there
</I>&gt;<i>                 was no way your boss would authorize such a thing.
</I>&gt;<i>                =20
</I>&gt;<i>                 So here are the parameters:
</I>&gt;<i>                =20
</I>&gt;<i>                 	* If we are getting many latin-americans/asians,
</I>&gt;<i>                 	  we should do it in a country that does not
</I>&gt;<i>                 	  require VISAs, so that rules out the US and
</I>&gt;<i>                 	  Brasil.
</I>&gt;<i>                =20
</I>&gt;<i>                 	* If we are getting mostly US citizens,
</I>&gt;<i>                 	  Europeans that are under the VISA waiver
</I>&gt;<i>                 	  program and just a few foreigners, we might
</I>&gt;<i>                 	  consider the US.
</I>&gt;<i>                =20
</I>&gt;<i>                 My choice would be to pick a cheap city, rather than an
</I>&gt;<i>                 expensive one, and one that has good airport
</I>&gt;<i>                 connectivity to minimize airfare cost, for case A we
</I>&gt;<i>                 have:
</I>&gt;<i>                =20
</I>&gt;<i>                 	* Cancun, Mexico.
</I>&gt;<i>                =20
</I>&gt;<i>                 	* Barcelona, Spain
</I>&gt;<i>                =20
</I>&gt;<i>                 For case B we could probably do Boston, unless some
</I>&gt;<i>                 University wants to step up and provide some facilities.
</I>&gt;<i>                =20
</I>&gt;<i> Love, Love, Love,
</I>&gt;<i> Miguel.
