It's possible, but the code that creates the shared area tries to be
very careful about races.  There used to be a race between exiting one
mono instance and starting a new one at the same time, but that
manifested itself as a failed assertion.

I'm assuming that all your machines have identical software installed,
and that mono is up-to-date.  Have you looked into potential hardware
issues with the machine giving the problems?  Make sure your memory
isn't faulty, etc.
