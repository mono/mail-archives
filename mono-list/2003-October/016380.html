Thats not true! Both from reading Miguel's emails and from talking with
him on IRC he is very clear: he would be happy to cooperate *provided we
are clear what we are getting into*.

When someone says to me `can you do me a favor' you usually say `what is
it', this is *not* a form of distrust, rather we have a natural desire
to understand what we are agreeing to before we agree to it.

Remember that if Miguel wants to do something, he will need to justify
it to to his boss.

Given that Miguel currently believes that none of the API is patentable,
and that the only evidence you have given him to the contrary is `we
have looked at this api, and it looks like a really thin wrapper' is
really not much for him to go on.

I am *sure* that given the number of hours you guys have spent on this
you could provide a small report on your findings, even if we choose not
to go down the path of collaboration, they would still be useful
findings to show to the community.
