&gt;<i> So here are my &quot;beginners&quot; questions:
</I>&gt;<i> - Which IDE should I use?
</I>
Emacs!  Vim!

OK, those aren't IDEs (though Emacs could qualify as an OS).

There are at least three IDEs on Linux: Eclipse (aimed at Java),
KDevelop (C++) and Anjuta (C, C++).

Eclipse has partial support for C# (see below for more information), but
it's not quite up to it's Java support (last I checked).

KDevelop and Anjuta might have Syntax highlighting support for C#, but
that's probably the extent of it.  I haven't heard anything about
support for using the &quot;mcs&quot; compiler, for example.

This is a question that should get a better answer in the future. 
SharpDevelop is rumored to be targeting Linux post 1.0.  But until then,
there might not be anything.  Sorry.

&gt;<i> - How can I get it installed and working?
</I>
Grab the RPMs (KDevelop, Anjuta)?  Except for Eclipse, which is a tar.gz
(tar xzf eclipse-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz).  You can get the .tar.gz at
eclipse.org.

Eclipse C# syntax highlighting is a separate download, available at:

	<A HREF="http://black-sun.sourceforge.net/">http://black-sun.sourceforge.net/</A>

&gt;<i> - Is there a graphical Development Enviroment at all?
</I>
Sort of.  See above.

&gt;<i> - How can I get the mono debugger to work?
</I>
The mono debugger is in a unstable state.  So... you don't get it to
work.

This should be fixed (I hope?) by Mono 1.0.

As a partial replacement, there's always System.Console.WriteLine. :-)

Mono (the jit) also has a --trace argument, which can be used to spit
out extra tracing information.  Use --debug to get line-number
information in exception stack traces (use mcs -g to generate debugging
information).

&gt;<i>   I tried to build it on my machine, but I can't get beyond
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;configure&quot;. 
</I>&gt;<i>   Configure keeps complaining &quot;Cant find jay&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> - What is jay, and what do I have to do to get it working on my
</I>&gt;<i> machine?
</I>
&quot;Jay&quot; is a C# version of Yacc.  If that's confusing, ignore it.

It can be found in the &quot;Mono Class Libraries and C# Compiler&quot; source
download:

	<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mcs-0.28.tar.gz">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mcs-0.28.tar.gz</A>

It's also in the &quot;mcs&quot; CVS repository.

Within the tarball/repository, &quot;jay&quot; is in the &quot;jay&quot; sub-directory.

It has a Makefile, so just enter the &quot;jay&quot; directory and type &quot;make&quot;. 
The &quot;jay&quot; binary will be placed in the same directory, so you'll need to
ensure that &quot;mcs/jay&quot; is in your PATH so that the debugger Makefiles can
find it.
 
&gt;<i> May be there is a paper out there in the www that some one has written
</I>&gt;<i> who went through all this already? That would be greate!
</I>
There's always the mono-list archives...

&gt;<i> Sorry, if some,many, maybe all of these questions sound stupid, but as
</I>&gt;<i> I said I am a beginner concerning this subject and I hope to find some
</I>&gt;<i> one who can get me on the way.
</I>&gt;<i>

Feel free to keep asking questions.
