<PRE>Okay, this whole thing is just silly. I don't want to be seen as taking
sides, but allow me to paraphrase this with whatever objectivity I can,
based on what I've read (in some cases only lightly skimmed) from the list:

&lt;Norbert&gt; It is possible to demonstrate that Windows.Forms is just a thin
wrapper of old work.
&lt;Miguel&gt; Well, maybe, though I disagree. Where is the evidence for this?
Note that making the claim publicly without evidence could be said to be
downright deceitful...
&lt;Rhys&gt; YOU CALL US DECEITFUL?! What manner of rudeness is this?! I demand
that you apologize immediately!
&lt;Miguel&gt; Well, uh, can you show us any documentation that supports your claim?
&lt;Rhys&gt; YOU ARE ASKING ME TO SUPPORT YOUR CLAIM THAT WE ARE DECEITFUL?! I am
HIGHLY offended!
&lt;Miguel&gt; The fact of the matter is that we have to share information for
this to proceed. It cannot be based on word of mouth alone.
&lt;Rhys&gt; Surely Novell is not going to just release all legal research done
in this area! Why should we do this for you, after you have called us
deceitful?!
&lt;Miguel&gt; I never did call you deceitful. However, you DID claim that
System.Windows.Forms is unpatentable, and while I'm sure you can back up
your claim, this cannot proceed publicly until this information is shared.
&lt;Rhys&gt; I wish I could give you documentation, but in fact I didn't make
any. I read over the API many times and convinced myself that
System.Windows.Forms is MFC in disguise, but I did not videotape myself
doing this. I STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED MY APOLOGY! We have decided we aren't
going to help you.

If it seems that Rhys is acting childishly, it is because that's how it
seems to me. Legal collaboration should be done with an intellectual
approach. Such petty issues as repeatedly demanding an apology for a
POSSIBLE implication of one of Miguel's statements do not seem to be
appropriate behaviour for someone who wishes to make an impenetrable legal
argument to patent lawyers, and it certainly doesn't befit an adult
discussion on a mailing list such as this.

I have no wish to receive flame, but if you are truly willing to &quot;let
bygones be bygones&quot;, then Rhys, please let your (incorrect, as far as I can
tell) intepretation of Miguel's statement be bygone, along with the ensuing
apparent necessity for an apology. Miguel was not saying that you were
acting deceitfully; rather, he was saying that continuing on and making a
public claim (more public than the mailing list, say) that such
documentation exists when it does not would be not only deceitful but
legally insecure.

And this one is just my opinion (and possibly my limited understanding of
the issue), but why would beneficial legal information be withheld as
proprietary information when its release would be beneficial both for the
community and for the project's well-being? If Mono succeeds in the
business world, it could very well become a future icon of Novell. Today,
we know Novell for NetWare and its directory services, but perhaps 10 years
from now, Novell will be known as &quot;the company behind Mono&quot;, and legal
research indicating that the parts of .NET used by Mono are unpatentable
would most surely be a boost to this project. It would also allow the open
source approach to be applied to the legal research; supposing there were
any errors, surely they would be found and, if possible, corrected, well
before that legal research would be used in a courtroom to defend Mono's
very existence.

I'll admit that the tone of this e-mail is a rant, but I believe the
message is important: Miguel has been trying to promote active and open
cooperation, with effective bidirectional flow of information, and Rhys,
you have been primarily focusing on getting an apology for the inferred
accusation of deceit. Don't let a personal issue stop a group/business
collaboration. Both Mono and DotGNU are excellent projects, and many people
are putting a huge amount of work into them; don't sacrifice that work to
an indignation and a misunderstanding.

Just another couple of pennies,

Jonathan Gilbert
