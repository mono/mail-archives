<PRE>Sorry for being late on anwerings, Ian...

&gt;<i>Rafael,
</I>&gt;<i>the NAnt makefile has been re-organised since 0.8.3. I think you'll find 
</I>&gt;<i>that the current cvs builds much more smoothly.
</I>
Wonderfull news, I'll have to get the cvs version, someday

&gt;<i>There is no mininant anymore - just run make in the nant basedir.
</I>
Thanks god!!!

&gt;<i>You'll probably still need to tweak the config file as by default it 
</I>&gt;<i>expects mono to reside in /usr/local.
</I>
Yes, mono is developed with an install prefix of /usr/local, but RPM 
releases put it in /usr (which I prefer anyway). I probably will change the 
NAnt config to use the release location, instead of the developing one.

&gt;<i>If you want to keep NAnt.exe in a seperate directory to the task assemblies 
</I>&gt;<i>then you can add /usr/lib to the &lt;nant taskpath=&quot;&quot;&gt;  attribute in 
</I>&gt;<i>NAnt.Exe.config  and NAnt will look there for task assemblies. Note this is 
</I>&gt;<i>a ';' seperated list.
</I>
Thanks for the information. I was sure there would be such a configuration,  
but I'm just starting to use NAnt and all it's schemas (config &amp; build) are 
mostly unexplored territory for me.

&gt;<i>I can't speak of other projects but we ( nant developers ) will definately 
</I>&gt;<i>accept patches for mono friendliness. Feel free to post patches/comments to 
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="mailto:nant-developers@lists.sourceforge.net.">nant-developers@lists.sourceforge.net.</A>
</I>
Thank you, I'll do if needed.

&gt;<i>I would prefer that the NAnt cvs tree is as mono friendly as possible 
</I>&gt;<i>rather than having a forked version in the mono tree.
</I>
Me either...

&gt;<i>Of course - shipping a version of NAnt with mono releases would be a great 
</I>&gt;<i>help for new users.
</I>
I would also like it to happen, because there's lots of NAnt buildfiles out 
there.

Someone brougth out the idea of a Mono Certified project, kind of a 
repository for libraries and apps, compatible with mono, maybe we could have 
NAnt packages there. Ideally, this repository would need to be synch'ed with 
mono releases... Just thoughts

&gt;<i>btw I offered to submit patches to the NUnit project for mono friendliness. 
</I>&gt;<i>Waiting on a response now.
</I>
Good. I had to correct  just one line of code, and build it only for the 
console to have it running in Linux, but I didn't have time to use NUnit2 
tasks for seeing it working inside NAnt.

&gt;<i>which code did you need to comment out in resgentask.cs ?
</I>
In truth, i had to uncomment some lines! In the following property get 
acessor all but the 'return false'  lines where commented out...

protected override bool UsesRuntimeEngine
{

  get
  {

    if (Project.CurrentFramework != null)
    {

      if (Project.CurrentFramework.Name.IndexOf(&quot;mono&quot;, 0) != -1 )  // 
remove hardcoded ness
        return true;

    }

    return false;

  }

}



Thank you,  Ian
