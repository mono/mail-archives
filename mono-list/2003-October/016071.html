Mono 0.28 Release
Hello everyone,

A new release of the Mono runtime and SDK is available for UNIX and
Windows. Packages for various distributions are also available from our
download page.

Since the last release, 1,124 individual commits were done to our
runtime and class libraries.

144 bugzilla bugs were closed.

I know that the following summary is incomplete, I apologize for missing
major features

We have finished the SourceGear contract, which funded Web Services in
Mono as well as various improvements in the runtime. We are very happy
to have served our first customer, and we will continue to improve Mono
to make sure the Vault software runs flawlessly on Mono. 

As you can expect, this release features bug fixes everywhere: memory
leaks plugged, performance problems solved, performance improvements and
more. A special area of robustness is the client-side web services
component: it is extremely robust now, as one of the SourceGear
acceptance criteria was a 24-hour continuous test of their client
library that did millions of web service operations. 

We hope to bring the same level of robustness to the server side
component in the next release, the www.go-mono.com site documentation is
currently running with Mono and our ASP.NET implementation (that is why
the site has gone down a few times: we were using it on our production
system to use it under stress). 

Each new release of Mono opens the door for more abusive tests, and this
time is not an exception, we already have a few areas of performance and
scalability that we want to address for the next release. 

1. Availability

Binaries for various platforms are available from our web site from the

2. New Features in this release.

New Thread Locking

Zoltan removed the big locks we had in the runtime, and now we have a
finely grained lock system in the runtime. Runtime hackers can read the
included lock matrix document which describes the requirements to use
the new fine grained locks in their code. 

Ahead of Time Compiler Optimizations

Zoltan has worked extensively on the Mono ahead-of-time compilation
feature (AOT). The AOT code is now considered to be production quality,
and also for the first time precompiled code runs faster than JITed
code. This resulted in a 13% compilation speed up for the Mono C#
compiler, reducing the compile time to 3.185 seconds. A clear goal of
the team for the next release is to reach 3.1416 seconds. 

An MCS bug prevents System.dll from being precompiled currently, we hope
to fix this by the next release, but everything else should work fine. 

Web Services

Now we have a complete Web Services stack in Mono, In this release we
added: 

      * The WSDL command line tool: this tool is used to generate web
        service client proxies from a WSDL document (local or remote). 
      * WSDL documents: now ASP.NET can generate a WSDL document for any
        web service that it hosts. 
      * Web service documentation page: it shows information about the
        methods of a web service. It also provides a form with which you
        can test simple methods. 
      * Support for HttpGet and HttpPost protocols. 
      * Our WSDL documentation page (<A HREF="http://.../file.asmx">http://.../file.asmx</A>) also can
        generate a sample proxy for you, if you don't want to use wsdl. 

Notice that the stack was already functional in 0.26, but the addition
of the WSDL tools makes the setup complete for developing completely on
Mono. 

The work to support Web Services was possible thanks to SourceGear. We
should all send them a token of appreciation. 

Xml Serialization

New XML serializer generator tool (genxs). With this tool you can
generate a XML serializer for any type and customize it to your needs.
For details about the use of this tool see Lluis' blog:
<A HREF="http://primates.ximian.com/~lluis/blog/archives/000120.html">http://primates.ximian.com/~lluis/blog/archives/000120.html</A>

Lots of fixes and improvements to support the WSDL generation and
consumption. 

Security

Sebastien has implemented Authenticode(tm) and the code is now part of
the distribution. 

A couple of new tools are available: signcode and chktrust. The former
is used to sign assemblies (or any PE files) and the later is used to
verify signatures and timestamps. 

Web Service Enhancements

Implementations of WSE 1.0 and WSE 2.0 appeared on the CVS, thanks to
Sebastien, Duncan, Todd and Daniel. We build both assemblies at this
point. 

XML Improvements

Speed and memory usage: extensive use of --profile and various clever
tricks from Atsushi and Ben. Lots of performance critical classes were
improved, and XPathDocument (which is used extensively by XPath and
Xslt) uses arrays of structs for its implementation to improve
performance. 

XML Schema validation support in now in XmlValidatingReader (although it
is not finished). It also means that now many schema component
constraints have been implemented. 

Remoting

Added support for CallContext. Now the CallContext is sent through
remoting boundaries and fixed various problems related to in/out
parameters in Remoting invocations. 

Improved robustness, specially for asynchronous calls. 

Generics

Work continues on supporting generics: more changes have been done to
the runtime, class libraries and tools, but we are not complete. 

To build the generic version of Mono, you have to compile the code from
source, and build the class libraries with the `generics' profile (make
PROFILE=generics). The generics C# compiler is called `gmcs' and not
`mcs'. They will merge in the future, but we wanted to maintain mcs
robust, and do all of our experimentation on a separate branch. 

XSLT Managed Engine

Over the past month, Ben's Managed XSLT engine has grown by leaps and
bounds. The implementation now offers compliance in critical areas such
as template conflict resolution. It also implements all of the XSLT
elements, including xsl:number. All of the extension functions with the
exception of format-number have also been implemented. 

Oleg Tkachenko, a seasoned .NET developer, joined Ben in his efforts on
XSLT, working on making the design of outputting XSLT much better. His
work will allow for better compliance with the spec, greatly improved
speed, and support for mode=&quot;html&quot; for xsl:output. 

The work of all the XSLT hackers has resulted in a major rewarded, in
many cases the managed engine is faster than the C based libxslt. 

Although the Managed XSLT provider is still not the default provider,
you can enable it by setting the MONO_MANAGED_XSLT environment variable,
like this: 

        	export MONO_MANAGED_XSLT=true



PowerPC Runtime

Progress on the PowerPC JIT engine, but the full engine did not make it
into the 0.28 release, it should still be available before the Microsoft
PDC. 

Windows.Forms

We got a nice upgrade from Vladimir at OpenLink for WineLib: various new
DLLs from the Wine runtime are now available (in particular all the
common dialog routines are now available to us). Vladimir is currently
working on updating WineLib to the latest edition of Wine. 

Jordi Mas contributed the ListViewItem widget and the file dialog and
Jonathan Hogg contributed a few fixes to the code base as well. Brian
Takita contributed the List control. 

Alexandre Pigolkine continued fixing the various low-level controls to
have the same rendering behavior that they do have on Windows together
with Jerome Laban. We started a thread to discuss the future
implementation strategy for System.Drawing to be fully cross-platform. 

Dennis continues in his quest to fix all the signatures in the
Windows.Forms. Johannes added support to make Wine track the theme
settings of Gnome (we will fully complete this on the next release). 

System.Drawing now has migrated to use Cairo bindings on Unix. 

IL Assembler

Jackson was in charge of most of these improvements. New features in
this release: .data, p/invoke support, allow multiple constraints on
generic parameters, Oberon is now self hosting with our il assembler and
plenty of bugs fixed. 

JScript and Vsa

Cesar has picked up again on JScript and has done incredible progress on
JScript and the Vsa engine, still not ready for hello world, but moving
along. 

Bug Fixing

As you can expect bug fixes everywhere: ASP.NET server and client,
ADO.NET, memory leak fixes. The client side for web services is
extremely robust (we passed the 24-hour continous test from SourceGear
and fixed tons of memory leaks, performance issues and stability
problems). 

We hope to bring the same level of robustness to the server side
component

&lt;BR&gt;
Lots of fixes and improvements to support the WSDL generation and consumption. 
&lt;H3&gt;Security&lt;/H3&gt;
Sebastien has implemented Authenticode(tm) and the code is now part of the distribution. &lt;BR&gt;

A couple of new tools are available: signcode and chktrust. The former is used to sign assemblies (or any PE files) and the later is used to verify signatures and timestamps.

Progress on the PowerPC JIT engine, but the full engine did not make it into the 0.28 release, it should still be available before the Microsoft PDC. 
&lt;H3&gt;Windows.Forms&lt;/H3&gt;
We got a nice upgrade from Vladimir at &lt;A HREF=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.openlinksw.com"">http://www.openlinksw.com&quot;</A>&gt;&lt;U&gt;OpenLink&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/A&gt; for WineLib: various new DLLs from the Wine runtime are now available (in particular all the common dialog routines are now available to us).

&lt;H3&gt;JScript and Vsa&lt;/H3&gt;
Cesar has picked up again on JScript and has done incredible progress on JScript and the Vsa engine, still not ready for hello world, but moving along. 
&lt;H3&gt;Bug Fixing&lt;/H3&gt;
As you can expect bug fixes everywhere: ASP.NET server and client, ADO.NET, memory leak fixes. The client side for web services is extremely robust (we passed the 24-hour continous test from SourceGear and fixed tons of memory leaks, performance issues and stability problems). &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
We hope to bring the same level of robustness to the server side component 
&lt;H2&gt;3. The people behind this release&lt;/H2&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;
This list is not complete, it is missing contributions that were sent to the list, as it was very hard to track the two million incremental line patch since the last release (lots of documentation, thats why ;-).
