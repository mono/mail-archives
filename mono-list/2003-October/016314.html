The result of which I provided in my last message.  What I didn't provide was 
the days and days of looking through the API convincing ourselves that it was 
just MFC in a different sheep's clothing.  Sorry, but I don't have a time 
machine to go back in time and video myself looking at documentation.

And I agree.  Norbert wants us to be more cautious in areas for which there is 
no clear existing API's that we can point at and say &quot;it's just a change in 
material&quot;.  If it was up to me, I would say &quot;who cares about patents&quot;.

We've hedged our bets on the GUI toolkits.  Now it is time to hedge our bets 
on other parts of the system.  There is nothing deceptive about that.  It is 
prudent policy in the current legal environment.

&gt;<i> For us to cooperate in this delicate matter, I must trust you, and so
</I>&gt;<i> far you are not giving me any sense of security.
</I>
If you won't accept us at our word, then we've already lost the trust.

You can consider the offer of collaboration withdrawn.  Call us when you have 
something to offer other than a replay of the last hundred flame wars.  We're 
willing to let bygones be bygones.  When are you going to do that?

Cheers,

Rhys.
