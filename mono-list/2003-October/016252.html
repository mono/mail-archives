<PRE>Hello,

   J=F6rg did make a very important point that is worth discussing:=20

&gt;<i> Most things have been said already.
</I>&gt;<i> My main concern about 1.0 aren't new features. I think all major bugs
</I>&gt;<i> should be fixed or sorted out.
</I>
Absolutely.

We are working to fix all the reported bugs and plugging the
functionality that we had not implemented before.  But we also need
your help. =20

We need more and more apps to be tried on Mono, because every new app
will probably expose one or more bugs on its foundation.  For instance,
Vault exposed tons of failures, missing features and scalability
problems.  IBuySpy and BlogX have uncovered various features that we
did not know existed on ASP.NET, and .Text has exposed a couple of
failures in Serialization.

But we need more tests, and we need your help.  We need people to try
out their web services, their database applications and their webforms
applications on Mono and push the limits of the runtime.

Dick for example has been on a quest to implement CultureInfo, and we
are very happy that Mono now optionally can use the open source
`international components for unicode' from IBM to implement all of
this functionality. =20

I am very happy that this major component that we had ignored for so
long now has been finally implemented.

Miguel
