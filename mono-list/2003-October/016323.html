I didn't misconceive, but others might, so...

</I>&gt;<i>=20

</I>
Thats fine. I can live with that. :)

&gt;<i> &gt;2. ASP.NET (Web stuff)

&gt;<i> Web Services.
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>
I'm sorry if I offended. I know that its already seperate. What I was
responding to was Miguel's suggestion of having one big 1.0 release. My
suggestion was a few smaller 1.0 releases.

(Btw, what web service stuff can you do thats not part of ASP.NET and
doesn't require a webserver?)

&gt;<i> &gt;3. GTK# (Gui stuff)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Why install GTK# on your web server? I know my web servers don't have X
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;on them, so I'd rather not download it on that system.
</I>&gt;<i>=20

</I>&gt;<i> huge mass of developers out there...
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>
Yes, but I still don't see why you couldn't say, release mono core 1.0
because its ready, and release GTK# a month later when it stabilizes.
(I'm not implying that GTK# is more or less ready then mono core, just
an example). What I'm trying to say I guess is that some parts might be
ready before other parts.

&gt;<i> &gt;4. mcs, mbas, monodis, ilasm, etc (Development stuff)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;These tools are only useful to developers. Most users wont ever need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;them, so why have them install them?
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> That is the cited misconception...
</I>&gt;<i> ASP.NET compiles pages on the fly, so it needs mcs, mbas, and any other=20
</I>&gt;<i> supported compiler, to be installed.
</I>&gt;<i> Some language runtimes also need ilasm, because only it gives access to t=
</I>he=20
&gt;<i> whole IL codes.
</I>&gt;<i> Also any application can do as ASP.NET and invoke those tools at anytime,=
</I>=20
&gt;<i> because they are wrapped in the core libraries.
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>
I understand this too. I didn't say that some of these packages couldn't
depend on each other. What my suggestion is, is that some platforms
don't need all of the tools, so make it easy not to install them, and at
the same time, we might be able to release some of the packages before
others. For example, I'm sure MCS is getting close to stable and that
ASP.NET, being much newer, is not quite as close. By having a separate
ASP.NET release, we can release MCS sooner and release ASP.NET a little
later.

I'd rather have the stable parts of mono asap and wait for the less
stable parts rather then have to wait for everything to stabilize.=20


Best regards,
Bob
