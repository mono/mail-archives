lazy.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First: I'm not one of the #D Devlopers, but I can give some infos about 
</I>&gt;<i> this thopic:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Curretnly, you won't be able to run #D on linux since it heavaly depends 
</I>&gt;<i> on System.Windows.Forms.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since the #D developpers thought about a linux version, the main #D 
</I>&gt;<i> developper Mike Krueger startet a port of the Java gui library SWT (used 
</I>&gt;<i> and developed in Eclipse).
</I>&gt;<i> This was the beginning of the SharpWT project (you will find some notes 
</I>&gt;<i> of this on the list archives of this list).
</I>&gt;<i> SWT was designed to use native widgets on each platform and it exists on 
</I>&gt;<i> diffrent platforms including Win32 and Linux/GTK. The Port of the common 
</I>&gt;<i> and Win32 part was done by Mike and Pedro Abelleira Seco and I started 
</I>&gt;<i> to port the GTK part.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Idea from the #D crew was to port #D over to SharpWT and have it run 
</I>&gt;<i> on Linux and Windows (and probbably on other platforms).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The current state is this (AFAIK):
</I>&gt;<i> - Win32 port of SharpWT mostly done
</I>&gt;<i> - GTK port has a good base, but here is still work to do, some widgets 
</I>&gt;<i> arent here in the GTK part and some things generats errors and crashes
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is a branch in the #D source tree that has some things portetd to 
</I>&gt;<i> SharpWT. But this is far from complete. AFAIK didn't work the #D crew 
</I>&gt;<i> currently on the port to SharpWT because they going to 1.0. But 
</I>&gt;<i> afterwars, I think, there will be more effort on porting it to SharpWT.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the meantime, I try to work on the GTK part of SharpWT. to have it as 
</I>&gt;<i> close to the Win32 functionality as possible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For more informations, please have a look at the sd-mono-poirt 
</I>&gt;<i> mailinglist (@ximian) and read through the archive of it.
