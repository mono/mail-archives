Eh, I think I have a good idea and there's some code, but there's a lot
of work to be done. I guess just using the same make magic would be the
thing to do for the time being.

If anyone gets to writing a really compelling build tool, switching to
it should be easy. So if the current build system is ugly but works,
there's not much reason to switch from it.

I'd really discourage using NAnt though -- I'm not too familiar with it,
but I find the XML syntax awful and, well, it doesn't seem to have been
*designed*. I don't want to rag on nant too much because of my limited
understanding of it, but I think if we're going to switch to a &quot;next
generation&quot; build system we'd want to explore our options.
