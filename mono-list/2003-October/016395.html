&gt;<i> Hello,

&lt;PRE&gt;&lt;FONT COLOR=&quot;#737373&quot;&gt;&lt;I&gt;Hello,

Yes, Jay Freeman.  No, he was not a Ximian developer.

Ximian Labs was a research and development team inside Ximian that
developed infrastructural components for Gnome and the rest of Ximian to
consume.

The product teams were the desktop, red carpet and evolution.  We
provided foundation tools to them.

&amp;gt;<i> &amp;gt; We remained quiet, as we moved the teams over from their existing

He was a developer that joined us, because he had worked earlier in
another compiler with Michael Meeks.  Ravi left Ximian to pursue a
degree in St Louis, but still remains involved as a contributor (and
helps us fix bugs when he can).

After Ravi left, Gonzalo joined the team to focus on ASP.NET.  Lluis
joined almost a year later, specifically to work on our web services
infrastructure and remoting.

&amp;gt;<i> I'm sorry for my ignorance and my curiosity, but I think that it's an

</I>
I also happen to like the history of software a lot.  In fact, I find 
the historic and human side of software more interesting than the
software itself.
