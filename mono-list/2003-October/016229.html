I think the major question is &quot;who is Mono 1.0 for?&quot;.

Is the purpose to target more of the same kind of people who have
already found Mono, or is it to extend the Mono-awareness in other
groups as well? If the latter is desirable, a &quot;1.0&quot; tag can always be
used to attract the press, which can in turn cause the word to spread to
places it hasn't yet reached -- which in turn can raise expectations...
(I'm thinking Windows users here, but also people who are looking for an
alternative to Java or for a good framework to extend Unix/Linux who
haven't yet discovered Mono.)

If Mono 1.0 is difficult to use and grasp, and if it causes
disappointment to the people who have never seen it before the 1.0
release, then a great opportunity has been lost.

For everyone who is already using Mono, a version tag of 1.0 will hardly
make any difference if the functionality you need is there. To these
people, it's Just A Number (or it should be, anyway).

I think it's actually not so much about what subset of .NET to release,
and more about making sure that what is released is usable in practise,
is of the highest quality, and that the release is accompanied with a
message that helps potential users to have the right mind set when
looking at the product.

I second the opinion that documentation is of very high importance -- it
is part of the message telling what Mono 1.0 is, and what it isn't
(yet).

To conclude, Mono 1.0 should be high-quality, as stable as possible, as
well documented as possible, and it should contain the pieces that are
needed for Unix/Linux hackers as well as people coming from a Windows or
Java background to start building things with as little adaptation
needed for the tool change as possible. As if this weren't everybody's
wish list, anyway :)

Cheers,
