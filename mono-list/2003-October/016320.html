<PRE>John,
    Check out the mcs module from CVS. The class/ directory containes 
all the code for the mainline (i.e. corlib, System.XML, etc.). The 
directory also contains the nunit2 tests.  You can run the tests, add 
tests as neccesary, and fix tests that fail.

The documentation system is in the monodoc module in CVS. You can update 
the core docs in the class/ directory in that module or you can put one 
of the non-core modules (like gtk-sharp) to document. The documentation 
is in ECMA XML docs format and there are plenty of examples. For 
documentation there's a seperate mono-docs-list on ximian.com
