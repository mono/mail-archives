<PRE>&gt;<i> Yes, but I still don't see why you couldn't say, release mono core 1.0
</I>&gt;<i> because its ready, and release GTK# a month later when it stabilizes.
</I>&gt;<i> (I'm not implying that GTK# is more or less ready then mono core, just
</I>&gt;<i> an example). What I'm trying to say I guess is that some parts might
</I>be
&gt;<i> ready before other parts.
</I>
GTK# is already released independently of mono.

&gt;<i> I understand this too. I didn't say that some of these packages
</I>couldn't
&gt;<i> depend on each other. What my suggestion is, is that some platforms
</I>&gt;<i> don't need all of the tools, so make it easy not to install them, and
</I>at
&gt;<i> the same time, we might be able to release some of the packages before
</I>&gt;<i> others. For example, I'm sure MCS is getting close to stable and that
</I>&gt;<i> ASP.NET, being much newer, is not quite as close. By having a separate
</I>&gt;<i> ASP.NET release, we can release MCS sooner and release ASP.NET a
</I>little
&gt;<i> later.
</I>
Here is where I think you misunderstand.

System.Web is a base class library that contains (basically) ASP.NET.

Are you suggesting that mono gets released without System.Web?

That will then leave a lot of developers insanely confused, as that
class contains not only ASP.NET stuff, but also stuff like: the SMTP
mail client classes. And while that isn't such a huge issue, what
happens when someone who doesn't really understand whats going on goes
and downloads a C# application that uses that namespace, and it wont
work?

And saying that 'MCS' can be released is insanely misleading.

MCS itself is a 1.2MB application, which is by no means an indication of
the size of mono. MCS itself *relies* on the corlib, which is 3.7MB
alone. And even a copy of mono with just the corlib and mcs is going to
be found pretty lacking by any standards.

So, can you please clarify exactly what you mean by releasing MCS and
then releasing ASP.NET separately?


&gt;<i> I'd rather have the stable parts of mono asap and wait for the less
</I>&gt;<i> stable parts rather then have to wait for everything to stabilize.
</I>
Mono is already stable enough for development, just download the latest
release, and even better, show us the bugs you find, and we can make it
even more stable even faster.
