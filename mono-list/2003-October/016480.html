Thanks for the explanation.  I can see how the implicit operator can be 
useful in the example you describe; still, I think it wasn't necessary 
for C# to expose them to us.  I.e., let us deal with the explicit casts 
and spare the confusion they may cause.  In other words, an implicit 
cast from a Pear object to a Truck object can seem quite odd, assuming 
their inheritance tree has nothing in common.

  &lt;pre wrap=&quot;&quot;&gt;It's good to keep this in mind: C#'s &quot;builtin&quot; types (int, long, etc.)
are actually aliases for managed types (System.Int32, System.Int64,
etc.).  These managed types are (for Mono, at least) written in C#.

You expect the following code to work:

	int n = 42;
	long l = n;
	short s = (short) n;

Which means that the following code also works:

	System.Int32 n = 42;
	System.Int64 l = n;
	System.Int16 s = (System.Int16) n;

Which means that the managed implementation of those managed types needs
*some way* to represent to the compiler/runtime that some coercions are
&quot;safe&quot; (can be done implicitly), while others are &quot;unsafe&quot; (can be done
explicitly).

C#'s implicit/explicit operators are how this is declared and defined.

As for the differences between implicit &amp;amp; explicit, you understand the
difference already.  Implicit == doesn't need a cast; explicit ==
requires a cast.

    &lt;pre wrap=&quot;&quot;&gt;So I was reading my &quot;C# for Java Developers&quot; book and I came across the

It seems to me that explicit is used when you want to force your API 
clients to use a cast when dealing with different types.  So lets say 
that I have:

public static implicit operator Foo(Bar bar) {...}    and I also have a 
method called
public Foo morph(Foo foo) {...}

If I was ever to use my morph method with a Bar, I could issue the call 
like:

Bar bee = new Bee();
Foo faa = morph(bee);

And the compiler would be happy.  If I was to change implicit for 
explicit in the operator's declaration, the way of calling the method 
would be:

Foo faa = morph((Foo) bee);   // with explicit cast

Is this it, or is there more to it than this?  I also am aware that this 
isn't really a &quot;mono&quot; question per se, but I thought some of you would 
be willing to shed some light on the topic...  :-)
