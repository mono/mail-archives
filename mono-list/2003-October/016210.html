<PRE>&gt;<i> What should Mono 1.0 be?
</I>
Yes, the documentation should be comfortable and prepared with some =
examples comparable with the MSDN documentation. This is important for =
acceptance to many developers which are developing for the MS.NET =
framework currently. Especially the points which may differ between =
(paths and drives handling for example) MS.NET and Mono on Windows and =
Mono on Linux should be clear and easily understandable.

By the way: I think, we should also provide all the needed stuff for =
VB.NET in Mono 1.0. This is because more developers in the ASP.NET scene =
are developing in VB.NET than in C# since the most developers are coming =
from ASP with VBSCRIPT. If VB.NET would be missing, I see the risk that =
many developers wouldn't come back in a future release.=20

* What should Mono 1.0 be?

Well I got another point to consider about the time of release, like the =
quality and quantity of proper documentation. Even if we have a good =
chunk of the framwork in 1.0 status I really think is vital to have good =
docs in conjuction to them. Why? because my feeling is that many people =
are waiting for a 1.0 release of Mono:: to jump and use the framework, =
so the relevance of good docs so the acceptance and release of 1.0 goes =
smooth and quick. Otherwise we can expect a big wave of persons in the =
mailing lists looking for info that the docs should have, well that's =
IMHO. Thankfully we are in a good position with monkeyguide, monodoc, =
etc but need a extra push for a 1.0 release.=20

*When and where should we do a Mono developer summit.
Well I don't see why we can't have the 'big room with internet access, =
printers and laptops=B4 type of summit inside the formal type of summit. =
So I will go with the formal summit.

Location:

Oh tough one, I will say: no in Europe please, and finally i answer with =
a question: If a get the facilities and blessing from my university =
(UNAM, FC, Mexico) how great are the chances that the summit will be =
done there?
