I hate to be the one to break it to you, Rhys, but I think Microsoft was
using the name &quot;ilasm&quot; as a command name privately since _at least_ 1999,
and publically since the July 2000 PDC conference.

Are you suggesting that commands should have different names in
Unix-compatible environments than in Windows?  That seems like
a recipe for unnecessary non-portability.

Both DotGNU *and* Mono should use a different name.
People may want to install them both on Cygwin, and be able to
easily choose between the MS version and the other two,
without having to change their PATH.
