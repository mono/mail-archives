Actually, in this case, this is probably not going to work. The reason
is because of the X server that comes with Red Hat 8.0 is XFree86 4.2,
which does included an outdated version of the RENDER extension.

Red Hat 9, and Mandrake 9.1 both ship with XFree86 4.3 with a current
version of the RENDER extension. For these distributions, we have RPMS
on my site on primates and also on Red Carpet.

The problem with building Cairo on the older distributions is this:
since a dated version of RENDER is bundled in the X server, it is not
possible to ship the current version of RENDER in a separate package
because that will conflict with files already provided by the
XFree86-devel package.

To fix this, I'll probably have to build render and install it on top of
the files provided by XFree86-devel, specifically the header file. With
that, I can then build the upper layers of the Cairo stack and ship
packages for those components. The updated header file for RENDER will
still not be shipped with these older distributions, but the resulting
shared libraries should work.

I don't mind posting source RPMs, however, I find it frequently to be a
support hassle. A lot of people assume that it is fine to rebuild a
source RPM regardless of the targeted distribution. When that happens,
the package dependencies gets completely jammed up and things get
rapidly very messy from then on (i.e. 'just' fixing it with --force in
RPM). The dependencies for GNOME libraries are a good example of what I
mean, since the package names used in Red Hat, Mandrake and SuSE are all
different.

[ This is for everyone, and not just Richard ]
If you want the source RPM for something, please contact me and I can
send it to you. However, I fear that if I release source RPMs out to the
public, I'll get lots of support mail for no good reason. Besides, we
ship the prebuilt binary RPMs for our supported distributions anyway. If
you want to build it yourself, it's always possible to build from
tarballs/CVS.

I haven't had the time to work on building Cairo on 'legacy'
distributions such as Red Hat 8 or SuSE 8.2; it is something that I
really wanted to do this week. Please bug me again if it's not done by
the end of the week ;-)

Duncan.
