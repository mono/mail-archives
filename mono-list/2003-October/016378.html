After the initial exchange which went something like

  Norbert: &quot;Are you interested in talking about cooperation?&quot;
  Miguel:  &quot;Sure... please share the details&quot;
  Norbert: &quot;Ok, here is an overview of our current plan, and some
            of the information that we have obtained: ...&quot;
  Miguel:  &quot;You are totally wrong&quot;

my attempt of establishing cooperation had already failed... you
are right that in the following conversation, Rhys did not really
express interest in genuine cooperation, but neither did Miguel.

The attempt at establishing cooperation has failed.  Let's leave
it at that.

I'm writing this message not primarily because of Jonathan's posting
but because there has in the past been a *LOT* of bickering between
the two projects around the issue of why it doesn't work out for the
two projects to cooperate with each other.  The main scapegoats were:

 * it's Norbert's fault
 * it's Rhys' fault
 * it's Miguel's fault
 * it's DotGNU's fault
 * it's Mono's fault

I ask for these hostilities to end here and now.  Bickering serves no
useful purpose; it only drains energy on both sides.

Greetings, Norbert.
