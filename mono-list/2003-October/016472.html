<PRE>It's good to keep this in mind: C#'s &quot;builtin&quot; types (int, long, etc.)
are actually aliases for managed types (System.Int32, System.Int64,
etc.).  These managed types are (for Mono, at least) written in C#.

You expect the following code to work:

	int n = 42;
	long l = n;
	short s = (short) n;

Which means that the following code also works:

	System.Int32 n = 42;
	System.Int64 l = n;
	System.Int16 s = (System.Int16) n;

Which means that the managed implementation of those managed types needs
*some way* to represent to the compiler/runtime that some coercions are
&quot;safe&quot; (can be done implicitly), while others are &quot;unsafe&quot; (can be done
explicitly).

C#'s implicit/explicit operators are how this is declared and defined.

As for the differences between implicit &amp; explicit, you understand the
difference already.  Implicit == doesn't need a cast; explicit ==
requires a cast.

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And the compiler would be happy.  If I was to change implicit for

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Foo faa = morph((Foo) bee);   // with explicit cast
</I>&gt;<i>
