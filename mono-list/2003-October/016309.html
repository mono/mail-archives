<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> &gt; If you did such a careful study with your lawyer, would you mind
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; publishing it so others can review it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And I suppose you would just turn over internal Ximian/Novell legal advice and 
</I>&gt;<i> developer discussions should I ask for it?  Nice try to avoid the apology.
</I>
Rhys, I am not the one making claims that `Windows.Forms has no patent
violations', you are the one who claimed that you had done a careful
study. 

What I said is reflected on our FAQ: we dont believe that *any* of it is
patentable.  But if you are going to pick `Windows.Forms' as part of
your initiative of &quot;apis which are absolutely not encumbered by a
patent&quot;, then I believe that Norbert is miss-leading the community and
it can not be the basis of a completely pure effort to have a
non-encumbered system.

You claim that you did a careful study on Windows.Forms and its
applicability to the patent, and that is why its excluded.  I do not
believe either you or Norbert did any careful study.  

For us to cooperate in this delicate matter, I must trust you, and so
far you are not giving me any sense of security.  If anything, you are
avoiding the topic, just like Darl McBride is. 

&gt;<i> Anyway, from the USPTO's guidelines on patentability [1]:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     The subject matter sought to be patented must be sufficiently different
</I>&gt;<i>     from what has been used or described before that it may be said to be
</I>&gt;<i>     nonobvious to a person having ordinary skill in the area of technology
</I>&gt;<i>     related to the invention.  For example, the substitution of one material
</I>&gt;<i>     for another, or changes in size, are ordinarily not patentable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The last sentence is the important one: &quot;the substitution of one material for 
</I>&gt;<i> another&quot;.  Changing C++ in MFC into C# in Windows.Forms would seem to be 
</I>&gt;<i> little more than a change in &quot;material&quot;.
</I>
An excellent quote, worth keeping it around.

&gt;<i> Of course, we could be wrong - anything could happen once the C&amp;D's start 
</I>&gt;<i> flying.  Hence the hedge-betting on Qt# and Gtk#.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I (still) await your apology.  Accusing us of being deceptive, and then asking 
</I>&gt;<i> that we prove your own accusation, is quite offensive.  And needless to say, 
</I>&gt;<i> uncooperative.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Rhys.
