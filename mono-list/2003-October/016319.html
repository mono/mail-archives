<PRE>I would like to contribute on a regular basis to the Mono project.  I've read 
the documentation, written some console based apps with Mono and had a look 
around the source code.  I've also been programming in a professional 
environment using C# .NET (MS-Windows) for about a year and I am excited by 
Mono and would love to get involved.

I would like to do some unit testing to start with or maybe some 
documentation, but I was wondering which sections / classes need testing.

Could anyone please point me in the right direction?
Thanks
John Meredith
