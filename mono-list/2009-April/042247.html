<PRE>Hi,

Use the BitArray class. That's exactly what it's for. If it's possible for
you to store your genotype using bits as opposed to strings you'll *vastly*
reduce your memory requirements.

Alan.

3) What I'm currently doing is:
&gt;<i>  a) read in each line as a single string which is split based upon
</I>&gt;<i> whitespace
</I>&gt;<i>  b) input each SNP into a class which is stored in an ArrayList, or as a
</I>&gt;<i> string array in a List&lt;string&gt; (I've implemented it both ways)
</I>&gt;<i>  c) once the while file is read in, output each collection of SNPs by
</I>&gt;<i> chromosome to a different file for processing by other software
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been able to get past my initial problem by re-compiling mono with the
</I>&gt;<i> large heap size GC and when the entire data is read in, it takes up 17GB RAM
</I>&gt;<i> for a 300MB file.  I know I'm new to mono/C#, but I've been programming in
</I>&gt;<i> C++ for years and have written many commerical applications for large data
</I>&gt;<i> and nothing I've written to date has been as memory hungry as this.  I'm
</I>&gt;<i> hoepful I can get some good suggestions on how to improve performance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!!

</I>&gt;<i> rows
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; before Mono bombs out with an out of memory error.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How are you reading in these lines?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What I found was the mono executable was indeed 64 bit, but gmcs.exe and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mcs.exe were 32 bit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As Chris Howie mentioned, these are actually in platform-neutral IL, and
</I>&gt;<i> will be run using a 64-bit address space when using `mono`.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One other point, memory usage is horrible.  I admit that I'm new to C#
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mono, so my coding skills are not as good as others, but a 300MB file
</I>&gt;<i> should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not use 2GB RAM to read in 1/8 of the file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That depends ~entirely on how you're reading in the file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also keep in mind that .NET strings are UTF-16, so if your input text is
</I>&gt;<i> ASCII, you will require twice as much RAM as the size of the file, e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> 600MB of RAM to store the entire file as a string.  (Then there is
</I>&gt;<i> various object overhead considerations, but these are likely tiny
</I>&gt;<i> compared to the 300MB you're looking at.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I stopped using classes to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; store the data and went with List&lt;string&gt; and List&lt;string[]&gt; to read in
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; much data.  Any comments on how I might improve this performance would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To provide any comments we'd need to know more about what you're trying
</I>&gt;<i> to do.  For example, reading a 300MB XML file using XmlDocument will
</I>&gt;<i> require *lots* of RAM, as in addition to the UTF-16 string issue, each
</I>&gt;<i> element, attribute, etc. will be represented as separate objects, with
</I>&gt;<i> varying amounts of memory required.  DOM would be something to avoid
</I>&gt;<i> here, while XmlReader would be much better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The easiest question, though, is this: do you really need to keep the
</I>&gt;<i> entire file contents in memory all at once?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or can you instead process each line independently (or while caching
</I>&gt;<i> minimal data from one line to the next, so that the contents of previous
</I>&gt;<i> lines don't need to be maintained).  This would allow you to remove your
</I>&gt;<i> List&lt;string&gt;, and save a ton of memory.
