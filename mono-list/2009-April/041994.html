<PRE>Hi lists,

I am sending this to both Monodevelop-list and Mono-list because I
have not been able to get a reply from Mono-list and I am hoping that
If I ask in more general term one of the list might help on this.

I am hoping to work with MIDI and the Jack Connection Kit with Mono,
however after searching the class library and the Internet I am not
finding anything on it or if it is at all possible other than
marshaling the Linux parts and going on my own this way. In windows
you have to use Interop with wmm.dll.

If anyone can tell me if there is something or if I am searching for
something that is not there and will not be there anytime soon, it
would be much appropriated.

Thank you and kind regards,

--Sean Beeson (the one in Japan)
