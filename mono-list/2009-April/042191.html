I'm working on a large data problem where I'm reading in data from text files
with almost 2 million columns.  In doing this, I can read in about 25 rows
before Mono bombs out with an out of memory error.  I'm running this on a
node in a cluster where I've requested exclusive use of the node: i.e. I
have exclusive use of 8 CPUs and 16GB RAM.  Top shows that the code bombs
out at about 2GB RAM.  This lead me to investigate whether the mono
installation was 64bit or not as the cluster is an x86_64 cluster running
64bit SLES 9.

What I found was the mono executable was indeed 64 bit, but gmcs.exe and
mcs.exe were 32 bit.  I went back and checked the binaries in the rpm from
ftp.novell.com and they are also the same.  So, in a 64 bit distribution of
mono, why are mcs and gmcs 32 bit?  Do I have to compile mono from source to
get 64 bit versions of gmcs and mcs?  Is this even possible?  Lastly, does
it matter?

One other point, memory usage is horrible.  I admit that I'm new to C# and
mono, so my coding skills are not as good as others, but a 300MB file should
not use 2GB RAM to read in 1/8 of the file.  I stopped using classes to
store the data and went with List&lt;string&gt; and List&lt;string[]&gt; to read in this
much data.  Any comments on how I might improve this performance would be
appreciated.

Thanks!!
