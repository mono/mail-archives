I think System.IO.Ports is available in Mono
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/HowToSystemIOPorts">http://www.mono-project.com/HowToSystemIOPorts</A>&gt;  (I have no idea how
current or out-of-date that page is).   There doesn't seem to be many
open bugs
&lt;<A HREF="https://bugzilla.novell.com/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=System.IO.Ports">https://bugzilla.novell.com/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=System.IO.Ports</A>&gt;
but googling about makes it seem iffy.

Port makes are arbitrary, don't hard-code them and that shouldn't be a
problem.
