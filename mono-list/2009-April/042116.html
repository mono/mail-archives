Well, if you want to write your own language, I would say that
outputting bytecode is the best thing to do.  You do not necessarily
have to optimize it, just output it.

Your other option would be to output machine language... :-)

&gt;<i> I could output C# source (or C, or C++). I could also translate it to

</I>&gt;<i> A += 6*2 (or REG = 6*2; A = A + REG;). What is the easiest way?

</I>
If you want to compile to another higher-level language, you can do
that.  There are plenty of languages that work that way, check out Vala
for an example of one (Vala is a C# like non-managed language which
compiles to C code).

It doesn't much matter if you compile to a high-level language or to
IL (which is, for all intents and purposes, high-level assembly
language).  Either way, you'll need to read the input program, parse
the syntax, give the syntax meaning, and output generated code.  If
you're generating lower-level code (e.g., IL) then you're going to have
more flexibility in what you can do in your language because you're
building the result with smaller building blocks, if that makes sense.
