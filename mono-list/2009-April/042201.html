How did you determine that they're 32-bit? I'm pretty sure this is not
the case, since they're just IL code that gets JIT'd and run on the
Mono runtime.

&gt;<i> The architecture flag on .exe files is useless in this context since

</I>&gt;<i> My guess is that the .exe files are flagged 32-bit so if you copy them

</I>&gt;<i> windows.) &#160;If they were flagged 64-bit they would not run on 32-bit
</I>&gt;<i> windows, and since they are IL that would make no sense.
</I>
Mono doesn't mark binaries as 32-bit or 64-bit specific. Such flags do
exist, but Mono neither sets nor respects them.

There are actually 3 GACs on Windows64: 64-bit, 32-bit, and noarch
(&quot;anycpu&quot;/&quot;MSIL&quot;). The main purpose AFAIK is mixed-mode assemblies,
but it's also useful if you make P/Invokes to libraries that only
exist on one architecture, or have arch-specific struct layouts etc.
If your exe is marked as 32-bit, it's run with the 32-bit .NET
runtime, and can use 32-bit and noarch assemblies and GAC. Similarly,
64-bit exes are run in the 64-bit runtime and can use noarch and
64-bit libraries and GAC. On Win64, noarch executables, such the ones
compiled with Mono, get run by the 64-bit .NET runtime.

To run a GTK# app on Win64, I had to use corflags.exe from the .NET
SDK to mark the mcs-compiled exe as 32-bit, since GTK# currently only
works on 32-bit.

csc is able to set the platform directly. For more info, see
