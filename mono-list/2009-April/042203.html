How are you reading in these lines?

As Chris Howie mentioned, these are actually in platform-neutral IL, and
will be run using a 64-bit address space when using `mono`.

&gt;<i> One other point, memory usage is horrible.  I admit that I'm new to C# and

That depends ~entirely on how you're reading in the file.

Also keep in mind that .NET strings are UTF-16, so if your input text is
ASCII, you will require twice as much RAM as the size of the file, e.g.
600MB of RAM to store the entire file as a string.  (Then there is
various object overhead considerations, but these are likely tiny
compared to the 300MB you're looking at.)

&gt;<i> I stopped using classes to
</I>&gt;<i> store the data and went with List&lt;string&gt; and List&lt;string[]&gt; to read in this
</I>&gt;<i> much data.  Any comments on how I might improve this performance would be
</I>&gt;<i> appreciated.
</I>
To provide any comments we'd need to know more about what you're trying
to do.  For example, reading a 300MB XML file using XmlDocument will
require *lots* of RAM, as in addition to the UTF-16 string issue, each
element, attribute, etc. will be represented as separate objects, with
varying amounts of memory required.  DOM would be something to avoid
here, while XmlReader would be much better.

The easiest question, though, is this: do you really need to keep the
entire file contents in memory all at once?

Or can you instead process each line independently (or while caching
minimal data from one line to the next, so that the contents of previous
lines don't need to be maintained).  This would allow you to remove your
List&lt;string&gt;, and save a ton of memory.
