Hello there

I also posted a similar thread on the DotNetNuke Forum.

I'm trying to run DotNetNuke on MONO. 

It would be something like that, instead of using:

Windows -&gt; would be for example Suse Linux 11.0 (Mono already as package
included)
IIS -&gt; would be Apache with ASP.Net modules OR XSP (a standalone ASP.Net
Web-Service)
SQL-Server -&gt; would be MySql  (with the MySql Connector)
.Net ability -&gt; would be of course the MONO-Project itself
 
What do you think about it? Is there at all any interest for such a project?

 

However I made some progress in it. I tried many things to run DNN on Mono,
but I don't think that it really would work so easily.


One of the attempt went like this:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DNN begining from zero and build it up step by step.
I modyfield the default.aspx.vb that much that no methods would be called,
just to see if DNN and MONO gets all dependencies from the Default.aspx.

so in my www folder on Linux there were absolut the basics:

Default.aspx
Default.aspx.vb (mpdyfied to a minimum, no methods are called)
web.config (modyfied to a minimum, no appSetting, no connection Strings...)
bin (empty folder)

 
1. So I startet xps2(a standalone webservice to run ASP.Net 2.0 on Mono). on
the Linux Maschine and startet the brower on the localhost.
2. xsp2 started to compile
3. Parser Error Message: Assembly DotNetNuke not found
-&gt; So I copied the DotNetnuke.dll into the bin folder
4. xps2 restarted
5. xps2 next thing was missing or could load or assembly
DotNetNuke.Services.Syndication,
-&gt; DotNetNuke.Services.Syndication.dll copyed into bin folder
6.Could not load file or assembly 'CountryListBox
-&gt; CountryListBox.dll copyed into bin folder
7.Could not load file or assembly 'DotNetNuke.WebControls
-&gt; DotNetNuke.WebControls.dll copyed into bin folder
8. Could not load file or assembly DotNetNuke.WebUtility        
-&gt; DotNetNuke.WebUtility.dll copyed into bin folder
9. after that I got this error

Compilation Error
Description: Error compiling a resource required to service this request.
Review your source file and modify it to fix this error.

Compiler Error Message:
/tmp/root-temp-aspnet-0/2f1c3fc8/App_Web_1580aaa0_1.vb(12,18) : warning
VBNC99998: Option Strict Off will probably fail.
/tmp/root-temp-aspnet-0/2f1c3fc8/App_Web_1580aaa0_1.vb(193,1) : error

/tmp/root-temp-aspnet-0/2f1c3fc8/App_Web_1580aaa0_1.vb(201,1) : error
VBNC30037: Symbol is not valid.

Source Error:

Line 10:
Line 11: Option Explicit On
Line 12: Option Strict Off
Line 13:
Line 14:


So I stuck here again... what I found out about this problem is on the mono
site, that
the support for late-binding, Option Strict Off / Option Explicit Off is
very limited (this is much more work and will come gradually)
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Visual_Basic">http://www.mono-project.com/Visual_Basic</A>

Versions are:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Linux Mono/XSP2
Mono Version: 2.0.50727.42	ASP.Net  Version: 2.0.50727.42
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows / .Net Framework
Microsoft .Net  Framework Version:2.0.50727.3074	ASP.Net 
Version:2.0.50727.3074
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

before this attempt I tried some diffrent attempt like to copy the hole
inetpub
(standard DNN folder after created a project with the Web-Developer),
but there is of course some other problems like the Database (data-provider)
but the xsp2 compilation got never so far to try to connect the Database

for the Database I know there is a solution like from the devart.com
they implement a MySQL Connector for 4.7 but so it would be one point solved
to port DNN on Mono

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think running DNN on Mono is theoretical possible, but running it real
there are still some difficulties.
this is just an information for you, but if you know something about it,
would be glad to hear it.

 

regards Robert
