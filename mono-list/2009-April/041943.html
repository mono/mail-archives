<PRE>You English seems pretty OK to me.  To your question (which others may 
be able to answer with greater detail): I've been successfully writing 
code on Windows and running it on Linux (Ubuntu+Mono) for over a year 
now.  It seems that the Mono guys have done a pretty good job at making 
a runtime that is compatible with any CLR assembly - at least those 
produced with current C# and VB compilers.

It stands to reason that they would also produce compatible assemblies 
with their development tools, so the reverse (Running code on Windows FW 
that was created on Linux+Mono) should be true as well.  There have been 
a few small 'gotchas' but overall very easy.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The sentences I've just write are true? Otherwise what I can't do?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to use Mono instead of Visual Basic .NET Express in order to
