The following comments are hopelessly generalized, but in a nutshell a lot of
.NET developers entering into Linux either don't have root, or are reluctant
to make changes to a system they don't yet fully understand. 

I'm not a big fan of java, but by comparison the JRE distributions do seem
to be fairly self-contained. One can install multiple JREs on a system in
any directory, and simply add it to $PATH. 

Mono in contrast seems to have followed the traditional linux approach of
'/usr/bin' and '/usr/lib'.  I can't say which approach is 'better', but I've
spent a lot of weekends groping for work-arounds. The RPMs don't have a
relocate package, and when I build from source with a --prefix option, I
still find references that are looking for mono in the system bin directory.

To be clear, I'll bet good money its something I'm doing wrong. But that's
the whole point. For a developer switching to Linux (which is a big percent
of Mono adoption), there are some big hurdles. Downloading and compiling
source is a no-brainer in the linux world, but for a windows developer/user
it feels a bit unnatural.

Overall Mono rocks. Looking forward to leveraging SIMD. Just taking a little
longer to get there than I'd hoped.
