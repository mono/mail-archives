<PRE>
All of the answers so far are right on.  And it's funny that you should 
ask about those specific things because right now that's about ALL my 
application does.  It polls data from COM ports (soon to be USB ports 
too) and stores it in a home-grown XML data store, which makes heavy use 
of streams for file read and write access.  Other than that it also 
provides a client interface via remoting, which is the only part I had 
any portability issues with.

For things such as you mention - port names and file paths - I push them 
out to configuration where the 'platform-specificness' of them doesn't 
matter.

Hope that helps,
Danny
