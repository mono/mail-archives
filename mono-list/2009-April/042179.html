Hello all. I've been developing a C# app using Visual Studio and targeting
.NET 2.0. I've been trying to simultaneously test it on both the Microsoft
framework and the Mono framework, and for a while was doing so regularly.
The Visual Studio binary always seemed to run just fine on Mono. I've
neglected to test the program against Mono for the past few weeks, however,
as I've been adding additional functionality. Today I decided to test
against Mono again ( v2.2). I opened the Mono command prompt and ran my
application from there. To my horror, I saw the main window begin to
draw...and then the app just closes. I do not get any error message from
Mono (I've tried running release and debug versions) so I'm at a loss as to
how to begin diagnosing the problem. Running on the Microsoft framework is
problem free. 

Does anyone have any idea how I can at least get a rough idea of where the
problem is? As I mentioned, I'm targeting .NET 2.0 as well as Windows Forms,
GDI+, and a hefty dose of System.Threading.

Thanks in advance everyone.
