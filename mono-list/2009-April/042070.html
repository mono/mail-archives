Are you adding a Fixed/Grid container to the window?  If so, please
not that for most applications *this is wrong*.

GTK+ uses container-based layout, which means that instead of saying
something like &quot;here are three controls, align their tops and put
their X coordinates at 10, 50, and 90&quot; you say something like &quot;divide
the space in the window into three vertical regions, put a menu bar in
the top and a status bar in the bottom, then divide the middle region
into three horizontal regions...&quot; etc.  This approach is much better
because it allows the layout engine to automatically position widgets
on your window, even if it is resized.  Plus if your users change
their font size or something your layout doesn't go to hell -- the
minimum widget sizes will increase with the font size and your layout
will be retained.

Look in particular at the VBox and HBox widgets.  Just about /any/
visual layout can be achieved with those alone, and what can't usually
can be with a Table too.
