Heh, it's so annoying that the full proposals are not available from
the google website, it would be so much easier, I could just point you
to the full proposal with the addendums, and you could judge for
yourself. Don't worry, we have a good game plan.

Yes, I read the Performance thread. I was a bit shocked at the amount
of freaking out going on there, frankly, but I'm jotting it down to
too much coffee and the excitement of a new SoC :) We're all for good
coomunication and neighbourly relations, and we appreciate very much
your willingness to help out. We're certainly going to take you up on
that ;)
