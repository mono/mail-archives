<PRE>The results* are in, and this year the Mono project has been awarded 9
slots. We had a lot of strong applications, and it was very hard to
choose between them - we had many more proposals worthy of support,
and there was a lot of fighting** between the Mono devs to narrow down
the list to the final 9.

The selected projects are:

Improving, testing and integrating ParallelFx into Mono
Jeremie Laval

CIL optimizer
Korn&#233;l P&#225;l

Class Designer Add-in for MonoDevelop
Manuel Alejandro Ceron Estrada

Implementing Git as class libraries in managed code
Matt Enright

Mono.Simd Amd64 Port
Jerry Maine

Database Designer Add-in for MonoDevelop
Luis Ochoa

TaskForce - Task focussed workflow for MonoDevelop
Anirudh Sanjeev

New features for VB.Net 9
Alexandru Mihai Muscar

PL/Mono: a procedural language for PostgreSQL
Olexandr Melnyk

We are now in the community bonding period, which means it's time to
get to know your mentors, get comfortable with any tools you're going
to need to use on the project, refine your project goals and scope,
and do any setup required to get ready for coding.

Things to do at this time:

- subscribe to the mono-soc mailing list -
<A HREF="http://groups.google.com/group/mono-soc-2009">http://groups.google.com/group/mono-soc-2009</A>
- if you haven't yet, join us on irc.gimpnet.org, the SoC-specific
channel is #monosoc
- get excited!

Thank you to everyone who submitted an application, and
congratulations to the accepted students!
