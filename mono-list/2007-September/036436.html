<PRE>Hi,

 

I scoured the web but I can't seem to understand what the problem is
exactly. Here is the situation:

 

I was using visual studio 2003 and created a web service that I tested
via xsp2/mono on Mac OSX &amp; Linux and I was a happy clam. I would just
copy the contents of the directory into the xsp root directory and run
xsp2.

 

Then I upgraded to Visual Studio 2005 and apparently that was a bad move
because I noticed the format of the web service contents changed
completely. When I use the publish web feature and copy those contents
for xsp2, I get the following error:

 

Server error in '/' application

Type Service not found.

Description: Error processing request. 

Error Message: HTTP 500. Type Service not found. 

 

At first I thought it had something to do with .NET 2.0 vs. .NET 1.1 but
it doesn't seem I can set which .NET Visual Studio 2005 uses?

 

I know there is something I don't understand which is probably obvious
to everyone else... please what am I doing wrong and what can I do to
make Visual Studio web service projects work with mono/xsp2 or is such a
desire forlorn?

 

Thank you kindly and have a great day,
