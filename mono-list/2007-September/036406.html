Dear Mono,

I am still having terrible problems getting mod_mono working after an 
upgrade to SUSE 10.2.

I get lots of errors like:

[Tue Sep 25 14:24:20 2007] [crit] Failed to remove dashboard file 
'/tmp/mod_mono_dashboard_XXGLOBAL_1', further actions impossible. 
Operation not permitted

The only way to reliably start mono seems to be to stop apache, kill all 
instances of mod_mono which have failed to stop, and restart apache.

The mono control panel doesn't work at all.

This causes downtime on servers which should never need downtime.

I have seen lost of postings about this, but none of the suggested fix's 
seem to work.

I have this directive in a virtual host:

------------------------------
  AddMonoApplications main_webservice &quot;/ws:/usr/local/ws/&quot;
  MonoMaxMemory main_webservice 134217728
  &lt;Location /ws&gt;
    MonoSetServerAlias main_webservice
    SetHandler mono
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
  &lt;/Location&gt;

  &lt;Location /mono&gt;
   SetHandler mono-ctrl
   Order Deny,Allow
   Allow from 172.16
  &lt;/Location&gt;
------------------------------

Please please if any person knows how to fix this, and recover my 
serious failing opinion of mod_mono, can they let me know!

Regards,

Ben Clewett
