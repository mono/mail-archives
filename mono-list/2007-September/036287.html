<PRE>Hi all!

I've been looking for a list of things that WPF support that Silverlight 
doesn't, but all I've gotten is partial definitions. Anyone knows where 
to look?

Also I was wondering... if developing desktop applications with 
Silverlight/Moonlight is possible, what features are to be missed 
compared to:
1. Other &quot;traditional&quot; toolkits: GTK, Qt/KDE, Winforms...
2. The new bleeding edge WPF.
3. Which are the &quot;complications&quot; when developing desktop applications 
with something thought for the web space.

I've seen the impressive NYTimes reader that was done in WPF running 
equally well on Silverlight so, apart from 3D acceleration (which I 
don't know of many desktop applications that need it), I don't know what 
other things one could miss when targeting the desktop. I guess, maybe 
local data storage in a desktop way is a bit more complicated to go through?

Thanks for any response.

Cheers!
</PRE>
