<PRE>Hi All
 
I have recently updated to the 1.2.5 version of Mono for my Arm based
platform.  I have a simple Flickr based application that used to work
and no longer does.  It simply consumed more and more memory until the
app crashes.
 
Here is example code that will cause the problem:
 
public static void Main(string[] args) {
    Flickr flickr=new Flickr(&quot;&lt;key&gt;&quot;);
}
 
I have tried the debugging techniques given before by Paolo (thanks for
that), but I am still rather confused.  The backtrace only ever goes
back as far as the last c# call, so I only ever get to see the top of
the stack.  Any ideas how I can get to see more of the stack frame?
 
However, the code does seem to be spending all of its time reflecting
information out of the Flickr.dll.
 
Does anyone have any ideas what might have changed to cause this
problem?
 
Cheers
 
Matt
