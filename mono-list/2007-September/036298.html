<PRE>It seems to me (although I hope I am wrong), that an important part missing
from Silverlight is simple things like right-click (context menus), scroll
wheel etc.  It seems to me they took the path of least common denominator (a
single-button mouse) and that this is very wrong when you need to develop
real apps.

As I said, I might be wrong about this and that there is full mouse support,
but from the little bit of info I got on this, you are limited to a
single-button (other than the Silverlight About context item).

Seems like a minor point but I think if you want to create rich apps you need
this functionality.

Please tell me I am wrong and that there is full mouse support!

</I>&gt;<i> Hi all!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've been looking for a list of things that WPF support that 
</I>&gt;<i> Silverlight doesn't, but all I've gotten is partial 
</I>&gt;<i> definitions. Anyone knows where to look?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also I was wondering... if developing desktop applications 
</I>&gt;<i> with Silverlight/Moonlight is possible, what features are to 
</I>&gt;<i> be missed compared to:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Other &quot;traditional&quot; toolkits: GTK, Qt/KDE, Winforms...
</I>&gt;<i> 2. The new bleeding edge WPF.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Which are the &quot;complications&quot; when developing desktop 
</I>&gt;<i> applications with something thought for the web space.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've seen the impressive NYTimes reader that was done in WPF 
</I>&gt;<i> running equally well on Silverlight so, apart from 3D 
</I>&gt;<i> acceleration (which I don't know of many desktop applications 
</I>&gt;<i> that need it), I don't know what other things one could miss 
</I>&gt;<i> when targeting the desktop. I guess, maybe local data storage 
</I>&gt;<i> in a desktop way is a bit more complicated to go through?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for any response.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers!
