&gt;&gt;<i> Mono's Moonlight may have trouble keeping up unless WPF will be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implemented in Mono at some point. The main reason Mono's Moonlight 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> works today is because there's only a small amount of WPF 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> functionality in Silverlight at this time.
</I>
&gt;<i> For 1.1, a severely trimmed down version of the CLR is used and
</I>bundled
&gt;<i> as a browser plugin. This is true for both Silverlight and Moonlight
</I>
I hope this is the case. I saw an interview video that led me to believe
the 1.1 assembly that gets downloaded to the browser would run with the
regular Mono CLR instead of a smaller CLR installed as a plugin. I was
left with the impression that the Moonlight plugin was only glue between
the browser and the regular Mono CLR.

I strongly prefer a scaled down CLR built-in to the plugin since that
would ease portability. There are many flavors of linux and we can't
assume a given user will have the right version, or any version, of the
Mono CLR. It wouldn't be good if we just give him an error and die. If,
however, the CLR was built-in to the plugin we'd only have to have him
upgrade his plugin.
