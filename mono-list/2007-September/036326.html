</I>They claim it's Silverlight, not XBAP or ClickOnce. It actually works on 
a Mac.
Here's the link:

Interesting thing (and counterpoint) is that the text placement is done 
on the server and goes to the client. Counterpoint is... I don't if that 
will use something Mono doesn't plan to implement. It's like having a 
part of WPF that's not included on Silverlight and taking advantage of 
it on the later. Sad thing is... it makes Silverlight not so 
cross-platforms as it uses WPF on the background and you still would 
need to have a Windows running it server-side (supposing my affirmation 
is right).

The thing about the right button click is also something problematic for 
the desktop... I guess the dream will have to wait and we still can't 
have the same application everywhere (using it from your desktop and on 
the web).

Implementing WPF is sooo much work... Seeing all the features it has, 
wow, I can't even think the amount of time it could get.

Cheers!
