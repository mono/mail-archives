<PRE>Dear developers

I just joined the list today because Shana told me this would be the best
place to put this.

I'm a student of the University of Alicante and member of the .Net Club of
Alicante for quite a while. I'm fond of .Net technologies (not meaning with
that &quot;fond of Microsoft's technologies). I'm an upholder of openSuse, Novell
and all the good work that the Mono team is doing in xplataformizing code.
And I've contributed some code as well to the Mono.Xna project (my first
attempts to become a real programmer). However I'm still a newbie.

Anyways, since I read in Miguel's blog that you were considering Spain for
the Mono Summit, and being in one of the most beautiful and big universities
in Spain (this is not just marketing, really) I thought: &quot;let's try to
convince them to come here&quot;. And that's what I'm trying to do.

I'm in contact with the director of the Politecnic School of my university,
which should be the department organizing the event. So far I haven't had
any opposition at all, but I haven't got any confirmation as well. Anyway,
I'd like you to discuss this, so... DISCUSS!

xD
Thanks for your work. If you have any question on this and I can help,
please tell me. I will be connected to this list from now on.
