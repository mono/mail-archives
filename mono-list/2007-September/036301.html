<PRE>&gt;<i>  Mono's Moonlight may have trouble keeping up unless WPF will be
</I>&gt;<i> implemented in Mono at some point. The main reason Mono's Moonlight works
</I>&gt;<i> today is because there's only a
</I>&gt;<i> small amount of WPF functionality in Silverlight at this time.
</I>

Silverlight is completely separate to the CLR runtime for the 1.0 profile.
Silverlight 1.0 uses exactly zero c# code and requires exactly 0 bytes of
the .NET framework to run. Silverlight 1.1 is a different story (continued
below). Silverlight is highly unlikely to expand to use more of the WPF
stack, so Moonlight should be fairly up-to-date. Secondly, as MS have
decided that they're going to support Moonlight as their 'Silverlight', it
is highly unlikely it will fall behind.


Unlike the way Silverlight is implemented on Windows, Moonlight sits on top
&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> Mono on the client. So linux client machines need Mono in order to use
</I>&gt;<i> Moonlight.
</I>

 For 1.1, a severely trimmed down version of the CLR is used and bundled as
a browser plugin. This is true for both Silverlight and Moonlight. You do
not require the .NET framework on Windows/MacOS to use Silverlight and you
do not require Mono on Linux to use Moonlight.


Thats to the best of my knowledge anyway, feel free to correct me if i made
a mistake.

Alan.
