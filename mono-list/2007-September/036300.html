&gt;<i>I've seen the impressive NYTimes reader that was done in WPF running 
</I>equally well on Silverlight

I doubt if the NY Times app could work on Silverlight but I'd like to
have a link for that if you have one. You may have been looking at a WPF
Browser Application (XBAP), which is quite different. A WPF Browser
application uses the full WPF stack on the client machine except that it
runs in a security sandbox. Or you might have been looking at a Click
Once WPF application.

Silverlight itself has very poor text support, and it's generally quite
weak across the board. It has streaming video and simple animations, but
almost none of the features you'd need to a typical business
application. The number of controls it has right now is extremely small.

Of course it will get better over time. Mono's Moonlight may have
trouble keeping up unless WPF will be implemented in Mono at some point.
The main reason Mono's Moonlight works today is because there's only a
small amount of WPF functionality in Silverlight at this time. Unlike
the way Silverlight is implemented on Windows, Moonlight sits on top of
Mono on the client. So linux client machines need Mono in order to use
Moonlight.
