<PRE>Hi again
 
Ok, so I have done a little more investigation into this.  
 
After investigating the call stack (using --trace=FlickrNet), it turns
out that the application was never getting past the .cctor function, so
I removed all statics from the class and the application no longer hung.
It turns out that the line that was causing the problem in the
FlickrNet.dll is:
 
  private static XmlSerializer _uploaderSerializer = new
XmlSerializer(typeof(FlickrNet.Uploader));
 
I have checked the diffs in the arm specific sections of mini between
1.2.4 and 1.2.5 and can see no major changes in there (there are no
changes in arch/arm either).  I'm not sure where else to look for
differences as this would appear to be an Arm specific problem.
 
Does anyone have any ideas why the above code would cause the runtime to
go into an infinite loop on the arm platform?
 
I'm using the sources from FlickrNet-25277.zip available from
codeplex.com.
 
Regards
 
Matt

Subject: [Mono-list] Regression on arm platform in 1.2.5


Hi All
 
I have recently updated to the 1.2.5 version of Mono for my Arm based
platform.  I have a simple Flickr based application that used to work
and no longer does.  It simply consumed more and more memory until the
app crashes.
 
Here is example code that will cause the problem:
 
public static void Main(string[] args) {
    Flickr flickr=new Flickr(&quot;&lt;key&gt;&quot;);
}
 
I have tried the debugging techniques given before by Paolo (thanks for
that), but I am still rather confused.  The backtrace only ever goes
back as far as the last c# call, so I only ever get to see the top of
the stack.  Any ideas how I can get to see more of the stack frame?
 
However, the code does seem to be spending all of its time reflecting
information out of the Flickr.dll.
 
Does anyone have any ideas what might have changed to cause this
problem?
 
Cheers
 
Matt
