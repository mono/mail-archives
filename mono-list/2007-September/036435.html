<PRE>Hi Gaita,
  Thanks for you respond.  I had already subscribe to it, yesterday.  I
am running with 1.2.5.  My problem is very straight forward, from a main
windows form, you just simply open up another form.  With two forms
open, I only have control of the second form only.  In order for me to
have the control back to the main windows, I have to close this form.

I have no problem when running this code in native Windows.

Thanks.

The best place would be either the mono list or the mono-winforms list
(if it's a winforms problem you're having). I've cc'd the mono-list
for you, please subscribe to it if haven't done so already.

&gt;<i> 1.       I am trying to port a C# Windows app to Mono running on SLES

&gt;<i> new form.
</I>
What version of mono are you running? The latest stable one is 1.2.5,
so you might be stumbling onto a problem that's already been fixed, if
you're running an older version. Also, a small test to replicate your
problem would be helpful.
