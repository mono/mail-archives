	It's an amusing situation where for a real time machine it doesn't so
much matter how slow the mechanism is as long as it's deterministic :-)

	As one totally ignorant of the issues - it seems that if people want
real time sections, could there not be an IFreeable interface - since I
assume each object is separately heap allocated; such that it would be
actually freed, and leave dangling invalid pointers ;-) Unsafe in the
extreme of course, but certainly a quick solution. Of course, supporting
that interface in the future with a different GC would perhaps be more
difficult, so it's a fast ugly fix.

	Then again, I imagine people want GC and also determinism, which means
cycle detection, hmm ...

	Regards,

		Michael.
