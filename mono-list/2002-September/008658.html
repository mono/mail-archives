If you started from the mono 0.15 release you'll have mcs.exe
and a bunch of .dll in the runtime directory. While they use the same
PE/COFF file format of native win386 executables, they are
actually cross-platform .net assemblies, so you can use them fine on
S/390.

</I>
You'll need mcs.exe, corlib.dll and System.dll from the runtime
directory in the mono-0.15 tarball. Note: if you used the cvs version
you'll need newer versions of both mcs and corlib. You may compile them
yourself if you have access to a linux/x86 box or a windows box.
You may also use the nightly snapshots at <A HREF="http://go-mono.com/snapshots/.">http://go-mono.com/snapshots/.</A>

We have this page: <A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/porting.html.">http://www.go-mono.com/porting.html.</A>
I'll need to expand it to cover testing.
Anyway, once you have installed a matching mcs.exe and
corlib.dll/System.dll, you can start running some simple tests.
You can get a tarball of precompiled tests here:
<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-tests.tar.gz.">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-tests.tar.gz.</A>
You may simply run mint test.exe for each test and check it returns a 0
exit code.
You may unpack them into the mono/mono/tests directory and run make test
in there. Once you get 100+ tests passing you may try to compile
something with mcs, just run it as follows:

	mint mcs.exe test.cs

If you can recompile most of the samples and run them successfully,
you'll want to bootstrap mcs: recompile it on your platform and use the
generated mcs to compile itself again. At that point you'll only need to
recompile corlib.dll to make your platform fully self-bootstrapping.
Running make -f makefile.gnu in the mcs toplevel dir should automate the
process for you.
Let us know how far you get and feel free to ask more questions on the
process.
