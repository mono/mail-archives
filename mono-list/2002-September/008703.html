The solution is to download and install one of the releases.  These contain 
prebuilt versions of everything and are meant as a way of bootstrapping.  You 
would use the release version to build the cvs version.  Then you make a 
backup of the cvs version and use this backup to build new cvs version.

wash, rinse, repeat ;)

&gt;<i> 1. Download and install a working Intel version of mono/mcs

</I>&gt;<i> This is an issue we've been struggling with for quite sometime.  It is a

</I>&gt;<i> Try to think of corlib.dll and the mono runtime as two parts of the same

</I>&gt;<i> you've installed the runtime, because installing the runtime can result in
</I>&gt;<i> 0
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kb dlls in /usr/local/lib.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me say that again for emphasis, the corlib.dll and mono runtime must
</I>&gt;<i> always be in sync.  Now the problem: how do you reliably compile corlib.dll
</I>&gt;<i> without the corresponding runtime.  Well the usual answer (this does not
</I>&gt;<i> always work) is to keep a different version (usually a release) of
</I>&gt;<i> mono/corlib/mcs installed just for compiling current cvs.  Once you have a
</I>&gt;<i> version of mono from cvs installed i would suggest making a backup of all
</I>&gt;<i> dlls/runtimes/mcs and keeping these in a safe place in order to restore
</I>&gt;<i> later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope this helps,
