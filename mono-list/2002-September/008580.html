All of the pnet build tools, including cscc, csant, and resgen,
are written in C so that the system can eventually bootstrap
itself without the chicken-and-egg problem.

I was saying that it will run on Mono (feel free to send
me patches if it doesn't).

&gt;<i> Also is it written in C# ? ...
</I>
Xsharp is written in C#, using PInvoke to access the native Xlib.
Just like Gtk#.

&gt;<i> I heard someone say something about
</I>&gt;<i> recompiling the C code using pnet compiler to generate IL.. Is this
</I>&gt;<i> something like that or just the C# wrapper ?
</I>
The pnet C compiler is not used for Xsharp.

To re-iterate: the code is plain vanilla C# and probably will
compile under mcs.  However, the automake/autoconf build system
is currently set up to assume the presence of pnet tools.  Right
now, if you want to build it without pnet tools, you'll have to
run mcs manually, until someone can apply the necessary voodoo
to the automake/autoconf system to use only Mono tools.

Cheers,

Rhys.
