We recently updated the versions of theses packages; having the old
versions linked on the web site is a bug and I'll fix it now.

</I>
Did the compile lines include -I/usr/local/include ?  If configure found
libgc then it should have updated CFLAGS too.  Please send me (not the
list) your config.log and a copy of the output generated by configure
and make.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> anyway, it was a very nice experience but I would like

</I>
There are shell scripts that should make compiling mono (and its
dependencies) much easier.  They are linked on the web site (in
<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/download.html">http://www.go-mono.com/download.html</A>) and also in cvs in the mono/doc
directory.  If these scripts also fail to build mono, then I'd like to
hear about it.
