When you build 'mono', it hopes that you will also have the 'mcs'
project checked out and already built.  The dlls which you listed are
built as part of the mcs project, and so you need to check out and build
the 'mcs' project first.  Once you have done that you can build the
'mono' project and it will pick up the dlls from ../mcs/class/lib.

(If you're starting from scratch, you will need to install a prebuilt
version of mono/mcs in order to build the class libraries in the first
place - it's a chicken and egg situation).

There is an easier hacky method.  Just check out 'mono', build it and
install it.  Download one of the prebuilt tarballs (like mono-0.15) and
copy the dlls from the tarball over the zero-sized dlls from your mono
build.  This will give you an up-to-date jit with older class
libraries.  It may not always work though.
