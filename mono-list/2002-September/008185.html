<PRE>hello friends,
it seems that the pakaged version of the mcs and 
mono are having a lot of problems!
I did happen to successfully build the runtime 
but after a lot of hook and crook!

There are a lot of dependencies which have to 
be taken care of and it seems that the links 
provided in the MONO download page.. have the 
older versions of pkgconfig, glib, libintl,libgc
and libiconv which provide the first stumbling block.

The main problem came with the garbage collector 
which happens to be 'boehm'.. In the makefile of 
the mono/utils directory. the include path has been
take as /usr/local/include..
so, effectively in the files like handles.c, processes.c
threads.c, wait.c, timed-thread.c etc... the #include &lt;gc/gc.h&gt;
ought to work... Somehow I had to change all the paths 
manually to #include &quot;/usr/local/include/gc/gc.h&quot; and move ahead!

the next problem comes with the iconv.h file. The config.h
(after the ./configure --prefix=&lt;path&gt; ) shows 
#undef HAVE_ICONV_H when actually it is present and it effects
the unicode.c file directly..
So I had to change that to #define HAVE_ICONV_H 1

anyway, it was a very nice experience but I would like 
to know what might have been the reasons for these flaws!

thanks and regards,
