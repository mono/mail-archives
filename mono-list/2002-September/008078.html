we also plan to use a two phase jit process, i.e. to to a fast jit run
first, and only do an expensive, highly optimizing run on frequently
used methods (like Intel ORP).

well, please provide profiling data here!

&gt;<i>

</I>
our .brg file are quite easily portable. But apart from that we have
even defined a .brg file which translates IL to an IR which is well
suited for interpreter. We dumped that approach because its not really
faster than the current interpreter, but much harder to debug. And
mainly because there are some standard tools to implement fast
interpreters, like vmgen. But performance was not the goal for the
interpreter, instead it must be easy.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And where is the advatage of p.net in comparison to mono?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A compiler which does not need itself ? (I'm joking !)... And of course
</I>&gt;<i> a C compiler which compiles to IL ... 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't see any advantage. (I have never understood, why the p-net project 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exists, because there exists mono)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well pnet is a GNU project ...
</I>
the whole mono code is LGPL/GPL, so what is the advantage?

 and of course it was the first to start.

thats true.
