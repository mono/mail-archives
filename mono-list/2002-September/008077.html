Well from what I could grep from pnet docs (and leech from the pnet devel
at college) was that 

IL -&gt; CVM is possible as well as JVM -&gt; CVM or Parrot -&gt; CVM ... So in 
short CVM acts as a sort of Pointer based bytecode specification which
is faster to interpret than IL ..

Mono is using a JIT , which is fast for repeated method calls ... JIT'ing
is a costly process ... The pnet's hotspot optimisation does something like
optimise only the frequently executed instructions ... For example , the
arithmetic,logical and load/store operations are &quot;unrolled&quot; into x86 code.
But method invocations may not be ... So in effect the overhead of full
JIT'ing is avoided . (an example would be tail calls ...)
 
&gt;<i> And _if_ this indirection is faster: Why don't mono the same?
</I>
A full JIT performs well in a single platform .... 'mono' is faster , but
'mint' is slower than pnet ...

&gt;<i> And if it is _not_ faster (what I think): Why choose p.net this way?
</I>
for the &quot;p&quot; --&gt; portability ... using a faster interpreter allows pnet
to become easily portable...than mono which needs to produce the .brg
and trampolines for each platform...

&gt;<i> And where is the advatage of p.net in comparison to mono?
</I>
A compiler which does not need itself ? (I'm joking !)... And of course
a C compiler which compiles to IL ... 

&gt;<i> I don't see any advantage. (I have never understood, why the p-net project 
</I>&gt;<i> exists, because there exists mono)
</I>
Well pnet is a GNU project ... and of course it was the first to start.
Also it comes on my Mandrake ISOs..

Personally, I cannot but appreciate one person taking something so far and
for fun !!! .. I am convinced that Rhys Weatherly is an alien ! ... (j/k)
(maybe I should switch to decaf .... and stop seeing X-files)

&gt;<i> To this, what you have cite, it seems, that compiling CVM-bytecode directly 
</I>&gt;<i> to native-code is faster then compiling .net-bytecode directly to 
</I>&gt;<i> native-code.
</I>
Yup... Because (as stated on pnet site) ... CVM is not polymorphic
like IL ... ie IL 'add' can add int &amp; int or float &amp; float ... It takes
a certain number of checks on the stack states to determine which
code the JIT should produce .... Such dynamic flow analysis slows down
JIT'ing of the IL code.

&gt;<i> In this case I ask myself, why p.net don't use the CVM-bytecode _instead_ 
</I>&gt;<i> the IL-code. Why existing no compiler which save the CVM-bytecode on disc, 
</I>&gt;<i> so that this code is that, what can be startet?
</I>
Of course, I saw it somewhere on the dotgnu mailing lists ... &quot;CVM uses 
pointers and memory on the heap,&quot; and so forth and cannot be written down
to the disk as it has no meta-data available to load or resolve.

&gt;<i> If the CVM-Bytecode is realy better then the IL-code, why don't create p.net 
</I>&gt;<i> not its own VM, which needs its own Bytecode-files instead of trying to 
</I>&gt;<i> start .net- and Java-programs direct (with the JIT-detour over CVM)?
</I>
Shh... it's &quot;classified&quot; .... part of their world domination plan ... ;-)

Also, Freddy ... Pnet &amp; Mono has buried the hatchet ... this discussion
might just make some people dig up theirs .. k
