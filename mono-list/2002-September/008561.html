Is csant and resgen written in C# (and thereby requiring it to run
it in pnet ?) ... I'm currently facing the issue with NAnt ..

Why should it not run on Mono ? ... It's standard IL , I hope ..
Also is it written in C# ? ... I heard someone say something about
recompiling the C code using pnet compiler to generate IL.. Is this
something like that or just the C# wrapper ?

Hmm... should try that soon .. ;-)
