Ok.  I've been meaning to write some of this up for a while now...

Mono on SPARC:

Right now, I have mint hobbling aling on my UltraSPARC running Linux.
In theory, the assembly should work on Solaris as well as well as SPARC
processors.

The trampoline code (in arch/sparc/tramp.c) does the job well enough
for simple stuff.  It doesn't gracefully handle register spillage, and
will just die.  Delegate support also seems to be dicy as well.  It
might work, it might not.  mcs doesn't run at all.  A simple Hello
World does.  arch/sparc/tramp.c is also slated to be gutted and
reworked.  It's getting way too ugly.  The mysterious &quot;why doesn't mcs
run at all&quot; bug might get fixed as well.

The code in io-layer/atomic.h needs some surgery as well for SPARC.
This should be simple, I think all the compare/add instructions are
atomic, so this Should Be Trivial (tm).

There is absolutely no work on the JIT as of right now.

The roadmap is as follows:

1. Get mint working.
2. Find bugs and fix them.
3. Work on JIT.
4. Fix more bugs.

Mark
