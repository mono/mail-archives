&gt;<i> Greetings,
</I>&gt;<i>  I'm just starting out porting mono to S/390. So far:
</I>&gt;<i> - I downloaded mcs &amp; mono source=20
</I>&gt;<i> - I've created the necessary trampoline stuff in mono/arch/s390 and am re=
</I>ady
&gt;<i> to start the build process
</I>&gt;<i> - make of mono completes cleanly (mint is one of the things that were bui=
</I>lt)

Ok, if anyone sees some gross errors, let me know...

First off, if you got mono to build on Linux S/390, and actually have a
s390/tramp.c file, you're most of the way there.

They way you start is start small in this case.  You'll want to
scrounge around and get precompiled .dll's and mcs.exe.  You'll find
those on <A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/download.html.">http://www.go-mono.com/download.html.</A>  The problem comes with
the chicken-and-egg problem of corlib.dll.  The problem is compounded
since you dont have a runtime (CVS mint/mono for S/390) that will match
any released corlib.dll.  The best way is to have a real Win32 box that
has csc and compile the class libs every time you update your runtime.

Failing that, I'm sure someone out there still does a nightly build of
the classlibs.

After you get some classlibs, you'll really want to run the regression
tests.  The tarball on the the Mono website I've found is out of date.
I should have an updated tarbool soonish I can put up.  Make sure the
tests pass with mint, especially delegate6.exe IIRC.  That one will
test mono_create_method_pointer.

Finally, try some simple C# programs, then try a full build of mcs by
using mint.

If mcs can build itself w/o problem...then you need to write the
JIT...and that I know how to do...sorta... :)

(Oh yea, the SPARC port is &gt;&lt; close, we have some bugs in reflection.c
that need some fixing.  But on my home Ultra2, we have mcs building
itself....).

Take care,
Mark Crichton
