<PRE>True that most windows apps were written with vb5/vb6. 

Converting vb.net over as the &quot;raw language&quot; wouldn't be a tremendous stretch. However, it is rather pointless, as the vast majority of the things that makes vb.net attractive &quot;graphical/form-based development&quot; would require a MASSIVE undertaking.

So, yes, you can create a vb.net compiler that will create IL. But the form designer(s) and such aren't going to be there.... making it kind of pointless. I always get into arguments with vb6 &quot;gurus&quot; regarding the feasibility of vb.net. It is designed to comfort the vb6 developer who (for the lack of a better explanation) is afraid of c# because it is too &quot;c++ like&quot;. 

Most of the .net framework was written in c#. Most of production-level code being produced in .net now is written in c#. 

My opinion is to not waste the time writing a vb.net interpreter. Getting the .net platform on as many platforms as possible should be the #1 priority. 

One final thing. Folks that know (and prefer) vb6 and vb.net MOST LIKELY do not have much *nix/c/c++ experience. So to target them as a userbase isn't such a hot idea anyway :)

Me, too. Don't get me wrong, I dislike the language.
It has no advantages, other than learning you bad programming style.

Still most Windows applications are written with VB (!!) and expecially
ASP.NET pages will use it. If we want to move Windows Developers to
Linux or get compatiblity VB.NET is very important.

Other than that, I is shipped with mono and can nicely show the
language-independece.

How far is mbas?
To my understanding tt's just the mcs sources with a BASIC parser at the
moment without code generation.

Rafael, can tell more about the status of mbas?
