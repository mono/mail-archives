<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> I am new to Linux and have RH 7.3 and been Win32 developing for a few
</I>&gt;<i> years, but I am trying to figure out the best place to get started
</I>&gt;<i> learning programming on Linux.  I want to start contributing to this
</I>&gt;<i> project because I feel very strongly about it, but I don't really know
</I>&gt;<i> where or what to do to get started.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Specifically I would like to know what environment I need to start.  Any
</I>&gt;<i> help / suggestions would be appreciated.
</I>
Just to follow up from Adam's post.

Once you have your development environment ready to go (and as Adam
said, you will want to set things up to use CVS eventually, so you can
bootstrap yourself) you might want to write a simple hello world
program.

Once you have that, the next step is to pick an unfinished class (see
our class status report on www.go-mono.com, click on one of the
&quot;assemblies&quot; listed) and finish it up.  Or you can fix known bugs in
classes (those marked with a magnifying glass mean &quot;unifinished&quot;).

Miguel.
