<PRE>Hi all,

I study how class libraries build is done under mono and try to fix this to nant. It seems that nobody use nant to handle this? Is anybody? Additionally there are two ways to use makefiles (with @list and without). I know - there was thread to discuss about it. But I think this should be unified. I could rework nant .build scripts and those list files (which is good - becouse nant does not work now: there error files in e.g. System.Data - not in @list). I already made support for those @list files to nant.

We could as well leave some easy makefiles in assembly directories to simplify class developers their job, but it could be as well done by typing &quot;nant&quot; in assembly directory just instead of &quot;make&quot;


point 2/ I do not know as you, but I'm little annoyed, when I every day (or every second) read message &quot;please help me bootstrap mono. This does not work for me&quot;. I know - this is not easy. I have difficulties with this myself several times. Ximian: dont you have some skilled build manager there? If you could allocate some human resources to mono project - this one person would be great! All free projects, which have commercial supervisor and build manager are greatly packaged (try e.g. MySQL)

If not we could try to write some scripts ourselfs. I have in mind some &quot;interactive&quot; scripts which contains lot of explanatory messages, user inputs what he/she want to be done etc.

Regards,
Martin
