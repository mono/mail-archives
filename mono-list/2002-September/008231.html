</I>&gt;<i>Yes, you're right. I am working on it. Here's where I am:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I have a PB project building mint and libmono (actually, a Framework I
</I>&gt;<i>called mono-cocoa). Mint seems to run but I haven't made it able to run
</I>&gt;<i>mcs.exe. This gives me the tough task of narrowing down mcs.exe by
</I>&gt;<i>building it on Linux until I find where the weakness in mint is.
</I>&gt;<i>Nonetheless, I think I have most of the bugs in the native interface
</I>&gt;<i>worked out and it should only be a matter of time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I would appreciate help anywhere along the line. Let me know and I'll
</I>&gt;<i>try to package up what I've got. It's a little bit different from the
</I>&gt;<i>basic mono build and it's not production quality.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Anyhow, my goal is to eventually provide a usable runtime for OS X that
</I>&gt;<i>acts in quite a native capacity. I'd like to adopt something similar to
</I>&gt;<i>the approach used for MRJ. This means that the Mono runtime should
</I>&gt;<i>eventually be able to tie in to the Obj-C Cocoa objects and there will
</I>&gt;<i>also be a packager for wrapping up Mono applications in a .app bundle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I've been working really slowly, though, because I'm on vacation. Having
</I>&gt;<i>someone else egging me along will probably help me to move more quickly.

Consider yourself egged.  I would LOVE to get a version of Mono that ran on the Mac, however fragile it might be.

I've made a couple of attempts to get the sources building on the Mac so I could help out.  Unfortunately, while I have plenty of Mac development experience (18 years, actually), my Unix skills don't seem to be up to the task of building Mono without clear step-by-step instructions.  I keep getting lost trying to install some required library or tool.  If someone could get me past this hurdle, I'd be happy to help with debugging, or with building Cocoa glue.  (I don't know much about Cocoa either, just Carbon, but I know where to go to learn about Cocoa.)
