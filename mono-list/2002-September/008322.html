I think it would be wrong to split forces at this moment.

We need a 'working' and fully implemented core library i.e. as ms. So my
2 eurocents is to focus on what is left to do now, and instead of
changing focus, (nothing wrong if some people want to try vb, js or any
two letter acronym there is), put more efforts into the fundamentals -
and of course the SWF-problem. Or maybe decide that there is now
swf-problem and instead _focus_ on gtk#.

I really think it is to early to change focus or put resources into
something else.
