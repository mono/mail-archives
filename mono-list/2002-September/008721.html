<PRE>Hi there

I stumbled across the Mono website on the weekend and after reading the FAQ, 
I decided to dive in and setup Mono on my PC, running Mandrake 8.1.  

I am creating a fairly small Java app which I wish to distribute and although 
I think the app's back end code is great, I am very disappointed with the GUI 
front end (i.e. Swing front end).

So now I am looking at alternate solutions, ranging from rewritting in Python 
or Kylix, or even creating a Kylix GUI and linking this to the Java back end 
via JNI (which won't be pretty from what I have seen).  Though Python may be 
'cool' and Kylix is 'RAD', I'm in no hurry to learn another language.  Hence, 
Mono/C# is very appealing!

Unfortunately, setting up Mono was a struggle which ultimately ended in 
failure.  I believe the main problem was setting up pkg-config 
(pkgconfig-0.13.0), but I also think things (e.g.  gc6.0, glib-1.3.12, 
mcs-0.15, mono-0.15) weren't being setup in their correct locations.

I was hoping someone could direct me to detailed instructions on setting up 
Mono on Mandrake 8.1.  What (exactly) I need, where things should be 
installed and if I require source code, rpms or both.

I hope someone can help.  Keep up the good work!

Regards
Steve Anderson
