<PRE>A new form designer VS.NET could be written for GTK# or any new GUI
toolkits that we wish.  I don't think that would be a problem.

I agree that there should be as few roadblocks when porting MS.NET -&gt;
Mono.  But remember, .NET is still in its infancy.  There is a strong
possibility that if a better cross platform GUI toolkit comes along that
people will start using it.  Both Swing and SWT are gaining momentum
despite arriving after AWT.  Windows.Forms is pretty much a richer and
ms-windows dependent form of AWT.

I don't want to discourage anyone from doing the port but....the Windows
Forms API design is horrible.

Here's what I fear will happen if Mono goes the Windows.Forms direction:

+ Windows.Forms is complex because of its heavy dependence on Windows.  
+ MANY, MANY Windows.Forms based apps utilize P/Invoke to overcome bugs 
+ and missing features.  This makes porting those applications to Linux 
+ even harder.

+ Windows.Forms *may* be deprecated before the port can be completed 
+ (like AWT was).  I'm being paranoid here....

+ Windows.Forms is poorly designed to start with.  I hate using Windows 
+ Forms (compared to Swing).  I'd hate it even more if I had to rewrite 
+ it to run on Linux!

Wouldn't all the time be better spent designing a better common
cross-platform UI library rather than cloning one that is poorly
designed and complex (in all the wrong ways)?
