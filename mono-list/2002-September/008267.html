</I>&gt;<i>I appreciate what you are trying to do of course, and experimentation is

</I>&gt;<i>X extensions, clipboard and drag and drop support, event processing,
</I>&gt;<i>dispatching and integration with third-party X libraries is hard.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>To make things even more complicated, Qt and Gtk have both theme engines
</I>&gt;<i>that allow the GUI skin to be replaced, another complication that you
</I>&gt;<i>might face in the long run.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>On the other hand, if you are building a new widget set, you might want

</I>&gt;<i>models which is the only area where I think you could get a significant
</I>&gt;<i>advantage over Qt and Gtk (but this windows is fairly narrow, as X is
</I>&gt;<i>getting a more advanced rendering system).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Of course, good luck with your task, but you might want to reconsider
</I>&gt;<i>maybe contributing to an existing binding.

</I>I consider may be contributing to an existing binding.
I understand that exist more important tasks at the moment , therefore I 
am contributing with Dennis Hayes on System.Drawing and I have interest 
in contributing in other parts of the project, it informs me on the 
parts where I could help.

At the same time, I working on that toolkit,

I divide my task on two parts:

1. XSharp or X11Sharp - the interface to the XWindow System,  working in 
progress.
2. Windows.Forms - a simple toolkit on the top of XWindow System.

Off topic: I have problems to access CVS of Mono, exists another form to 
get the last sources?
