<PRE>Hi there,

as it is known, Mono is able to use SWF via WineLib. As I am very new to 
Linux (I used to use Windows and am now switching over), I don't exactly 
know how to do this.

Perhaps anybody could be so nice to help me.

I've installed the current version of Wine (which includes WineLib, 
doesn't it?). This was easy and it runs properly.

Now I am trying to install .net Framework SDK, but Wine only tells me 
that it doesn't accept the setup.exe as an Win32 program. Did I do 
something wrong or have I completely misunterstood the howto? Is WineLib 
something else?

I'm very fond of Mono, but I'd like to use it with SWF.

It would be very great if someone could give me an advice!

Thanks in advance,


Golo Haas
