<PRE>I'm a little confused here, what exactly does a VB.NET runtime need to
support, all the documentation I've seen for the common runtime seems to
say that c# and vb.net are compiled to IL which is indistinguishable and
that both languages are using exactly the same class libraries.

What did I miss?

 As a VB6 Developer myself, I find VB.NET simply not interesting than
learning C#.
 It would be worthwhile to concentrate on efforts to run mono on
different architecture than implementing VB.NET.

 Also, Microsoft might find issues with mono having a VB.NET compiler as
it is still their proprietary language(Not an ECMA standard unlike C#
and ECMA script.)

 It would be a huge risk. Microsoft can change the VB.NET language
syntax any time they want. You would have to catch up with it if you
want it to be usable.

 Developing a CLI-Compliant language that's based on Basic is a
different thing than to create an exact copy of VB.NET.

 In any case what attracts people to VB.NET is the RAD GUI Designer. If
we have one such thing for mono C#, the problem is solved.
