<PRE>Oren,

I'm in the process of developing an application in VB and C# that uses no 
P/Invokes whatsoever. I haven't run into any places where it's truly 
necessary. Frankly, I don't have a lot of sympathy for developers who go 
under the hood and break portability for the sake of eyecandy.

What sort of P/Invokes are people using that actually provide needed 
functionality? Perhaps the solution is to provide the .NET developer 
community with encapsulations for the most common P/Invoke calls, so we can 
restore some portability.

If they even begin to care about running on Mono (they will, soon enough), 
they'll use our compatibility layer. If they need a Win32 call that we 
haven't covered, they can create their own encapsulation over it and submit 
it to the project. Their alternative is to cut off a significant share of 
their potential market.

In the case of the toolbar, for example, somebody could write a 
&quot;Windows.Forms.SuperToolbar&quot; object that would provide those features you 
need. Publish it widely, or in a central repository, and that's one less 
P/Invoke that's needed by end developers.

Cheers!
Eric

</I>&gt;<i>Miguel,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If P/Invoke of the Win32 functions is not supported, then I think that
</I>&gt;<i>Mono's SWF implementation will be, for all intents and purposes,
</I>&gt;<i>useless.  I have not yet seen a single, less than trivial, .Net Windows
</I>&gt;<i>application that did not use several P/Invoke's to the Win32 libraries.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I'd understand not supporting P/Invoke into 3rd party libraries, since
</I>&gt;<i>you'd need to translate those.  But I'd think that at least the Win32
</I>&gt;<i>DLL's should be supported since most applications already use them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>For example, anyone who is using a toolbar or menu control, other than
</I>&gt;<i>the included one, is relying on the ComCtrl32.dll library, among others.
</I>&gt;<i>Since the built-in toolbar and menu controls are pretty fugly and
</I>&gt;<i>feature-lacking, most people have chosen to use some other menu/toolbar
</I>&gt;<i>library.  Likewise, many applications make calls to set an XP Theme on
</I>&gt;<i>certain controls that the .manifest trick isn't enough for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>In the end, if Mono's SWF implementation doesn't take all of those
</I>&gt;<i>P/Invoke's into account, then I don't think that many people will be
</I>&gt;<i>able to use it since their apps have external dependencies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I hope that you reconsider.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
