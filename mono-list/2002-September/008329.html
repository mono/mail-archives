<PRE>My vote is for Tru64 or Sun Solaris(or other main Unix platform).

The first problem is VB.NET itself. Yes, there are a lot of VB code now.
However, converting VB6 code to VB.NET is not that easy. So the
supporting of VB.NET isn't that great. 

The most existing VB code is at the client side, and the work of
supporting of Unix platform is mainly on server side. .NET itself is
focusing on server side more than previous MS platforms does. I don't
think MS will support VB or VB.NET enthusiastically, especially that now
there is C#, that is much easier to learn than C++.

</I>&gt;<i> Hello!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is there any plan to port mono to commercial Unix platform 
</I>&gt;<i> such as HP 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Tru64, Sun Solaris?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ximian is committed to build at least the Linux/x86 JIT 
</I>&gt;<i> engine, and help others in porting to other systems.  
</I>&gt;<i> Currently am trying to find out how we should allocate 
</I>&gt;<i> resources on the Mono team, and it would be useful to know 
</I>&gt;<i> what people actually need.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I understand that some people might find Tru64 JIT support 
</I>&gt;<i> useful, but maybe VB.NET would benefit more people.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That being said, if your company is interested in hiring 
</I>&gt;<i> Ximian to support your favorite platform, we are interested 
</I>&gt;<i> in knowing about this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I should probably write a poll or something.
