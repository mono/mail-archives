Don't know about Python, but similar approach is used in Inferno system and its Dis virtual machine:

&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One thing I wanted to explore in the past (but there has been no need to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do so far) is to use implicit reference counting with cycle detection
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for the GC engine.  It uses some extra 32 bits of memory per object
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allocated, but it gives you the predictability you are looking for.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There are various papers that discuss the subject, we have some linked
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from the Mono site.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree, reference counting would be a viable alternative. I just don't know 
</I>&gt;<i> if and how cycle detection could be done efficiently (i.e. more efficient 
</I>&gt;<i> than a gc run). 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a garbage collector would be needed, even when reference counting is used, 
</I>&gt;<i> for defragmentation, and as only a small part of the data is really cyclic, I 
</I>&gt;<i> think that it would be a good thing to use reference counting and gc 
</I>&gt;<i> together. This would reduce the amount of work to do for the garbage 
</I>&gt;<i> collector and make it faster. Doesn't the Python memory management work this 
</I>&gt;<i> way?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I was not yet able to look at the gc interface of Mono. How difficult
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; would it be to switch from the currently used Boehm-Weiser collector to a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; different one? Could this be done for single domains or threads?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It is doable, but requires a lot of work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Too bad. Then it is your intention to keep the Boehm collector in forever? I 
</I>&gt;<i> thought that it was just an intermediate solution.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Holger
