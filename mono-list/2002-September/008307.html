<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> I agree, reference counting would be a viable alternative. I just don't know 
</I>&gt;<i> if and how cycle detection could be done efficiently (i.e. more efficient 
</I>&gt;<i> than a gc run). 
</I>
Well, for one you keep pointers to all the objects that are being looked
for cycles in a special list, so it is a smaller set.  The paper goes
into more detail. 

&gt;<i> As a garbage collector would be needed, even when reference counting is used, 
</I>&gt;<i> for defragmentation, and as only a small part of the data is really cyclic, I 
</I>&gt;<i> think that it would be a good thing to use reference counting and gc 
</I>&gt;<i> together. This would reduce the amount of work to do for the garbage 
</I>&gt;<i> collector and make it faster. Doesn't the Python memory management work this 
</I>&gt;<i> way?
</I>
You can already get &quot;regular&quot; GC with reference counting (that is the
disposing pattern documented).  But what I am suggesting here is that
the underlying GC instead of being the current conservative Boehm
becomes a reference-counting-with-cycles-detection one.  So refcounting
is done implicitly by the JIT for you.

&gt;<i> Too bad. Then it is your intention to keep the Boehm collector in forever? I 
</I>&gt;<i> thought that it was just an intermediate solution.
</I>
We might use the Intel GC once it has been reworked to deal with value
types and reorganized, but currently there is no pressing need to do so.
Miguel.
