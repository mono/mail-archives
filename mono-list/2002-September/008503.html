<PRE>I actually got excited about Mono initially for the idea of being able to finally write true cross platform GUI Apps. However, in the course of following Mono, GTK# and .Net I realized that this was a far to utopian approach to believe possible in such an early stage of the project.

The reason Swing was slow originally is because it was implemented to early in Java's lifecycle. The original AWT/Swing GUI's did more harm than good to java. I'd hate to see the same approach taken here and stifle the overall appeal of Mono.

With that said, if some group or person can find a simple, elegant and fast way to provide this level of functionality. I look forward to being able to help it mature.

Just my thoughts.

I agree as well.

I don't like how Swing apps look-and-feel differently than native
applications. Personally, I'd prefer something more like SWT. Let
me plug the wxWindows project again, they've done a great job of
developing a cross-platform GUI toolkit.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I really think that instead of porting Windows.Forms (which 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>would be VERY hard), we should be thinking more along the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>lines of creating something similar to Swing or SWT.  A swing 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>like implementation would be better as you would have more 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>control over component drawing (and thus better support 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>printing and UI capturing).  A designer plugin for VS.NET can 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>easily be written to support the new toolkit.  I think the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>added bonus of being able to *reliably* port .NET GUI 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>applications to .NET would encourage people to use the new 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>toolkit over Windows.Forms.
