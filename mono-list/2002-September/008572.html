</I>I don't know about what other people are advocating, but I'm myself
talking about having both systems, so that you can use the non-MVC
approach and the MVC one whenever you need one or the other.

Of course, for creating labels in a form, usually, you just want to set
the caption and that's all, but it's very useful to have the option to
use MVC whenever you want.
