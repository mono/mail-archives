<PRE>I think a number of you are putting words in to my email, did I say anywhere
that mono ui should not be using MVC??? That would be crazy! The basic lists
boxes etc that I talk about use an MVC model, it's just internalised, it you
want to externalise it you can.

From what people are suggestiing even the humble label should have an
external model, are they serious? Do they know how many labels some forms
have? I would much rather simple change the caption propoerty on the object
inspector rather than drag another control on to the form which will be
responsible for storing the caption string, and then hook up the label to
the caption model component. That is not a sensibile way to do things.
Perhaps there is a difference between a visual design environment and a
command line approach to designing GUIs, but I don't understand why pople
insist that all GUI controls must use an external model instead when
sometimes an internal model will do just fine.

As far as I know all ui controls in vb etc. use the MVC model, it's just
that some controls give you the option for an internal model in addition to
an external model, and there are trival cases in gui development when such
an approach is very convenient.
