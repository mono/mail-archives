<PRE>Very last post on the topic..this is getting boring.

&gt;<i> &gt; No decent programmer stores the only copy of his data in the UI
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; controls.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ::Tum
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's a bit rude I think and quite insulting to a lot of people, not
</I>&gt;<i> everyone is as clever as you are.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I'm sorry if it insulted anyone.  I do feel strongly about this issue
though.  
I was also getting a bit annoyed that you ignored my answers to the
problems you pointed out.

&gt;<i> &gt;if joe-wannabes programmers can't understand the &quot;complex&quot; idea of OO
</I>&gt;<i> they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;shouldn't be using .NET or Mono.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's is ever so slightly elitist, Java people talk a lot like that.
</I>So
&gt;<i> your little sign off &quot;OO, Naxi for the day' wasn't a joke after all.
</I>Are
&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;<i> saying that people who don't know how cars work shouldn't drive?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I was saying people who can't or won't learn how to _USE_ cars shouldn't
be driving them.

C# IS an OO language....

&gt;<i> signing off on this one.
</I>
Cool.  I am admittedly a bit of an OO Nazi. I hope everything is sweet
now :).
