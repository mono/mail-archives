    I am sorry to bother the list with this question, but I could not =
find a satisfying answer anywhere.=20
     =20
    My question regards overloading operators. As far as I know, if you =
want to overload some operator, it must be public and static.=20
     =20
    1. I dont understand why this have to be that way=20
  I would guess that the `static' requirement is for language =
simplification -- there is only one (consistent) way for operators to be =
expressed.  In C++, some operators must be global (read: operator&lt;&lt;, =
operator&gt;&gt;).  C# doesn't have global scope, so class-static is the =
closest equivalent.  Since some operators would need to be class-static, =
it was probably more consistent to just require that they all be =
class-static.  That's my best guess, anyway.=20

  I have no idea why  `public' is required.=20
    2. If I want to overload the ++ operator in a class that I dont want =
to be public, but internal or private, how can I prevent someone from =
accessing a method (the ++ operator) that has been defined public?=20
  Question to ponder: how will they access the public method if they =
can't access the class in the first place?  Consider methods that must =
be public, such as Object.ToString().  Is it a problem that this method =
is public, even in your internal classes?  Not usually -- non-internal =
users can't access the class, so the existence of a public ToString() =
method shouldn't be a problem.  The same should be true of any =
operators.=20

  (The answer to the above question of accessing internal classes is =
simple, actually: use Reflection and poke around...  Alternatively, =
modify the runtime to permit poking on internal data.  It's hard to =
protect against the runtime....  However, these ideas are not trivial, =
and can probably be ignored most of the time.)=20
This is not really a clean solution, is it? I mean, although I cannot =
access the class (so I dont have to worry about the &quot;public-nes&quot; of the =
methods inside that class, it does not mean that it is correct to force =
you to declare the method public. (although this could be, and probably =
is, just a simplification made by the language designers)
  However, the real question remains: why do you need an assignment =
operator?  Assignment operators are useful in C++ when wrapping =
resources, such as memory, files, thread locks, etc., to make sure that =
the resource is properly managed (in concert with the copy constructor =
and destructor)...  In C#, the garbage collector is used for resource =
management, removing (what I've found) the greatest need for the trio of =
C++ copy constructor, assignment operator, and destructor.  If you need =
something more deterministic, the IDisposable interface/idiom is =
appropriate.=20

I actually dont have a need for an assignment operator, but I think it =
is really nice if you can do something like

    obj1 =3D obj2;

instead of
   =20
    obj1 =3D new ObjectType(obj2);

This whole issue arises because c# treats objects as references to =
objects instead as the real ones (not that I find this wrong). I think =
that if you use a language that tries to be so simple as c# is, and that =
tries to &quot;help&quot; the programmer by simplifying syntax, etc, then it is =
suspicious not being able to write a simple object assignment  (without =
having both variables referencing the same object. Note that by simle I =
mean using the =3D operator). This could be just a decision made by the =
folks who thought about the language (and then I could not make anything =
about it, of course), so I dont want to make a big discussion about this =
here (because it is really a C# topic and not mono specific).

Finally, I want to thank you Jonathan, for your comments, I believe they =
helped

With regards,

Ricardo Kirkner
