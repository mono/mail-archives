Wine does work, but not in all circumstances ;)  For instance, I've been using 
wine to run csc on my windows partition for some time now...

You have this wrong.  You do not install Microsoft's version of SWF to use it 
under Mono.  Rather, Mono is developing it's own version of SWF to use with 
Mono.  This is being done through the judicious use of WineLib.  If you would 
like to try the SWF with Mono, you'll have to download from cvs and install.  
I do not know what the current status is nor the difficulty of installing.

&gt;<i>  &gt; The plan is not, to run the Framework on Wine, but to use some WineLib

</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; So, why would you to run setup.exe?

</I>&gt;<i> How can I use SWF using Mono? Or, to say it in other words: How do I set

You'll have to have a look at the cvs version of SWF.  This work has just 
begun so do not be surprised to find there isn't a whole lot there.
