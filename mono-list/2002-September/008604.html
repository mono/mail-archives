<PRE>Hi!

&gt;<i> We are neither detractors nor supporters, but implementers of the
</I>technologies our clients ask for. It has been our stance however that the
dotnet framework is still to early in its life cycle to even think about
writing secure, financial applications on top of. There are a number of
reasons for this, but the most important is that the API seems to still be
in state of flux and may require clients to write and rewrite solutions. Is
this opinion correct and would any one out there consider building a system
that needs to be running 24x7 on .net at this point.

Well, I don't think it's a problem.
MS has worked one year on fixing bugs in 1.0, which resulted in SP2, but
even they found very few.
It's quite fast and stable (I'm using it for much more than one year now).

At least in my opinion it's as stable as older MS technologies.

The API is fixed. MS is quite good at keeping API backwards compatible, they
won't break it, I'm sure.

Additionally you can install different versions of the Framework
side-by-side.

Johannes
