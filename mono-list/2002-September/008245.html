<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> I'm have a experience on this, I'm using and implement fpGUI. 
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.freepascal.org/fpgui/index.html">http://www.freepascal.org/fpgui/index.html</A>) and my idea is create a 
</I>&gt;<i> similar library in C#.
</I>&gt;<i> Another similar toolkit is FOX (<A HREF="http://www.fox-toolkit.org/fox.html">http://www.fox-toolkit.org/fox.html</A>), 
</I>&gt;<i> FOX as developed in C++ and your apparence is like a Windows.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My main purpose is developing a toolkit independent of GTK and QT.
</I>&gt;<i> When I will have something functional, I leave a version here.
</I>
I appreciate what you are trying to do of course, and experimentation is
always good.  But remember that there is a lot more in a toolkit that
meets the eye.  Both Gtk and Qt are mature toolkits that can be used for
international applications and can be used in a number of scenarios that
you might not have envisioned at this point.

Having witnessed the development of Gtk since it was created to this
date, I can tell you that doing a complete general purpose toolkit is
hard: keyboard navigation, accessibility, good font support, supporting
X extensions, clipboard and drag and drop support, event processing,
dispatching and integration with third-party X libraries is hard.

To make things even more complicated, Qt and Gtk have both theme engines
that allow the GUI skin to be replaced, another complication that you
might face in the long run.

On the other hand, if you are building a new widget set, you might want
to think about addressing portability or maybe exploring new rendering
models which is the only area where I think you could get a significant
advantage over Qt and Gtk (but this windows is fairly narrow, as X is
getting a more advanced rendering system).

Of course, good luck with your task, but you might want to reconsider
maybe contributing to an existing binding.

Miguel.
