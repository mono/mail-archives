Chris,

There is divergent work being done that should dovetail into a true Mono=20=

for OS X in the near future. When I started, a Linux/PPC interpreter was=20=

completed, and I have heard that they are now working on a Linux/PPC=20
JIT. Unfortunately, the trampolines (for native calls) are different on=20=

the Mac, and I decided to take a look at that. I'm moving pretty slowly,=20=

though, because I just quit my job and I've been enjoying other things=20=

in life instead of programming too much. So I can't give you an ETA.=20
Hopefully it will be soon.

Once the runtime is working on OS X, it will take some time for mono to=20=

become an attractive environment here. There will likely be people=20
working on a Windows Forms clone for Mono and I'd like to work on Cocoa=20=

integration.

Right now is there a good reason why you're not using Java? It's=20
probably the best choice for platform-agnosticism in the near future.

Chris,


There is divergent work being done that should dovetail into a true
Mono for OS X in the near future. When I started, a Linux/PPC
interpreter was completed, and I have heard that they are now working
on a Linux/PPC JIT. Unfortunately, the trampolines (for native calls)
are different on the Mac, and I decided to take a look at that. I'm
moving pretty slowly, though, because I just quit my job and I've been
enjoying other things in life instead of programming too much. So I
can't give you an ETA. Hopefully it will be soon.


Once the runtime is working on OS X, it will take some time for mono
to become an attractive environment here. There will likely be people
working on a Windows Forms clone for Mono and I'd like to work on
Cocoa integration.=20


Right now is there a good reason why you're not using Java? It's
probably the best choice for platform-agnosticism in the near future.=20
