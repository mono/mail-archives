<PRE>Hello!

&gt;<i> Is there any plan to port mono to commercial Unix platform such as HP
</I>&gt;<i> Tru64, Sun Solaris?
</I>
Ximian is committed to build at least the Linux/x86 JIT engine, and help
others in porting to other systems.  Currently am trying to find out how
we should allocate resources on the Mono team, and it would be useful to
know what people actually need.

I understand that some people might find Tru64 JIT support useful, but
maybe VB.NET would benefit more people.

That being said, if your company is interested in hiring Ximian to
support your favorite platform, we are interested in knowing about this.

I should probably write a poll or something.

Miguel
