<PRE>I don't see what the problem.  We have _four_ toolkits that are actively being 
worked on.  Qt#, Gtk#, SWF with winelib, and XSharp.  As far as 'on par with 
the Windows Forms tools' well Gtk# has glade and we're working on uic# 
backend for the Qt Designer as we speak.  The good folks over at ICSharpCode 
have also expressed interest in supporting Gtk# and Qt# as well as SWF with 
SharpDevelop.  I think we have a wealth of GUI toolkit options here guys:-)

Cheers,

Adam
