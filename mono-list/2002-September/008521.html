Though this looks like it might try to embed mozilla :-)

... not really answering any questions

Subject: [Mono-list] SWF Programming Question


Since the current consensus is that SWF will be using WineLib as a base,
does that mean that developers don't have to worry about their P/Invoke
calls to Win32 functions not working on Mono?  I.e., if my app calls Shell32
or User32, it'll still work since that's a part of WineLib.  Would that also
extend to Shdocvw.dll (a.k.a., MSIE's COM interface)?  Many programs use IE
(via Shdocvw.dll) to display HTML and to provide a WYSIWYG editor.  Would
calls to it via P/Invoke, COM and ActiveX be supported under WineLib?

I'm just trying to get a sense of what kind of compatibility there will be
for SWF applications since many of them use Win32 functions, COM, ActiveX,
and MSIE.

Thanks,

--Oren
