<PRE>That's not true.  A M-V-C model would mean that the control doesn't
store data at all.  The model doesn't have to store data either, it just
needs to produce the data on demand.  The data can come from an array or
from a database...the control doesn't need to know about it.

I think people find that you have to write a lot of code in swing
because they are unaware of a lot of the inbuilt classes and end up
writing their own models when they don't need to.  Java's anonymous
inner classes allow you to write your own models without explicitly
declaring a type :).


A very simple model list would look something like this:
(note: adhoc code, prolly doesn't compile...)

class ListBox
   : Control
{
   private IListModel m_Model;

   public ListBox(IListModel model)
   {
      m_Model = model;
     
      m_Model.Changed += new EventHandler(Model_Changed);
   }

   private void Model_Changed(object sender, EventArgs eventArgs)
   {
      Invalidate();
   }

   public override void OnPaint(PaintEventArgs eventArgs)
   {
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; m_Model.Count; i++)
      {
          eventArgs.Graphics.DrawString(m_Model.GetItemAt(i).ToString(),
...)
      }
   }   
}

interface IListModel
{
   public event EventHandler ListChanged;

   public int Count
   {
       get;
   }

   public object GetItemAt(int index);
}

class SimpleListModel
{
   public event EventHandler ListChanged;

   public void FireChanged()
   {
      if (ListChanged != null)
      {
         ListChanged(this, EventArgs.Empty);
      } 
   }

   public int Count
   {
      get
      {
          return 100;
      }
   }

   public object GetItemAt(int index)
   {
       return index.ToString();
   }
}

Using it would be simple:


IListModel myModel = new SimpleListModel();

// Make a list box containing the numbers from 0 to 99
// Notice how there is not an array of size 100 anywhere!

ListBox listBox = new ListBox(myModel);



You could replace myModel with anything.  You have to worry about
populating a list/tree/combo ever again.  You just need to fire an event
when your data changes, and the list/tree/combo will automagically do
the rest.

The M-V-C pattern actually means less work because you never have to
learn how to use a control beyond it model.  Who cares how you
add/remove an item from the listbox anyway?  Why would you want to store
data in TWO places?  With a model, the list data is retrieved only when
it is needed for repainting.  The ListBox never needs to store the data.
This decouples the data from the UI and saves memory.

If you ever need to change the model based on events from the view
(listbox), then you can add a controller.

This, ladies and gentleman this is a good design.  And it has been
proven outside of academia (swing, j2ee).  I really hope it will be used
extensively in any Mono UI library.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi everyone,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here are some of my thoughts on the state of GUIs and Windows Forms.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Windows Forms has very nice native controls.  It is fast, responsive
</I>but
&gt;<i> &gt; VERY POORLY designed.  It is only a thin layer about native windows
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; controls.  Using native controls is *ok*, but they could have at
</I>least
&gt;<i> &gt; used the model-view-controller design pattern. The first thing I did
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when I started using Windows Forms was to write model/controller
</I>classes
&gt;<i> &gt; for lists and trees.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Swing is wonderfully designed.  It is the best and most pure OO UI
</I>class
&gt;<i> &gt; library out there.  It used to have major speed problems, but that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hasn't been too much of an issue lately.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I really think that instead of porting Windows.Forms (which would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; VERY hard), we should be thinking more along the lines of creating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something similar to Swing or SWT.  A swing like implementation
</I>would be
&gt;<i> &gt; better as you would have more control over component drawing (and
</I>thus
&gt;<i> &gt; better support printing and UI capturing).  A designer plugin for
</I>VS.NET
&gt;<i> &gt; can easily be written to support the new toolkit.  I think the added
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bonus of being able to *reliably* port .NET GUI applications to .NET
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would encourage people to use the new toolkit over Windows.Forms.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If a swing-like toolkit was written, only a few native routines
</I>would be
&gt;<i> &gt; needed.  Drawing/blting (System.Drawing?), window creation and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; message/event dispatching.  This would be trivial to implement on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Windows and Linux.  Most of the UI could then be written in portable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; managed code :D.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
