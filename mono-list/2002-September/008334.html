<PRE>Make Mono compatible with many platforms or compatible with almost every
.NET Program, that's the question.

Somes said it's hard to move from VB6 to VB.NET, I don't think so. I've
done it. But, moving from VB6 to C# is harder.

As Microsoft told at
<A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnnews/2001/may/RAD/RAD.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnnews/2001/may/RAD/RAD.asp</A> &quot;Visual Basic
.NET will establish a new standard in rapid application development for
highly distributed Web Services and applications. While preserving the
essence of Visual Basic and providing the best desktop application
development experience for Visual Basic-based developers&quot;

I agree that coding in C# is a better idea. However, if you need to make
a very long or complex program, you'll prefer to make it faster using
VB.NET.

Making a VB.NET compiler is actually optional, but the VB.NET run-times
could be great.

However, if you make the VB Compiler, remember that many people will 

Have a nice day,
Laurent.

As a current VB programmer, here are my thoughts:
I've made a good living writing some decent code ala the Windows DNA
Architecture (COM N-Tier etc). I started out programming under Unix in
the
early 80's. Shell scripts,Awk, and ANSI C begat xBASE (dBASE, Clipper,
FoxBase/FoxPro/Visual FoxPro) and ultimately VB.

I'm not sure where you're getting the &quot;The most existing VB code is at
the
client side...&quot; statistic, but I haven't written a true Client/Server
solution in a very long time. You might be right...but who knows?

I'm also a VB programmer who loves *nix and runs SuSe 8.0 and RedHat 7.3
on
a couple of machines around here. My interest in this thread is simple:
I'm
retooling (again..sigh..) In fact, I'm sick of the technology treadmill
and
have decided to opt for more permanent tools. Right now I juggle VB,
ASP,
JavaScript, Oracle PL/SQL, MS T-SQL, XML/XSL.

To that end, C# and Java are my choices of languages on which I'm about
to
invest in more training, books, and screen time. I'm NOT planning a
transition to VB.NET. There is not enough similarity to VB6 to make the
investment worthwhile..at least for now. As is often the case, that
could
change given the need on a project..

I will be steering future projects to C#.

My vote is for Tru64 or Sun Solaris(or other main Unix platform).

The first problem is VB.NET itself. Yes, there are a lot of VB code now.
However, converting VB6 code to VB.NET is not that easy. So the
supporting of VB.NET isn't that great.

The most existing VB code is at the client side, and the work of
supporting of Unix platform is mainly on server side. .NET itself is
focusing on server side more than previous MS platforms does. I don't
think MS will support VB or VB.NET enthusiastically, especially that now
there is C#, that is much easier to learn than C++.

</I>&gt;<i> Hello!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is there any plan to port mono to commercial Unix platform
</I>&gt;<i> such as HP
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Tru64, Sun Solaris?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ximian is committed to build at least the Linux/x86 JIT
</I>&gt;<i> engine, and help others in porting to other systems.
</I>&gt;<i> Currently am trying to find out how we should allocate
</I>&gt;<i> resources on the Mono team, and it would be useful to know
</I>&gt;<i> what people actually need.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I understand that some people might find Tru64 JIT support
</I>&gt;<i> useful, but maybe VB.NET would benefit more people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That being said, if your company is interested in hiring
</I>&gt;<i> Ximian to support your favorite platform, we are interested
</I>&gt;<i> in knowing about this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I should probably write a poll or something.
