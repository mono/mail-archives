<PRE>Jon,

That was very educational and should be placed on the mono FAQ or
something like that. I have wondered what the low level differences were
between the two and now its getting much clearer (at the conceptual
level).

You made a comment regarding java being preferable for embedded
environments, that caught my curiosity. You seemed to be basing that on
the example of &quot;add&quot;, which with byte-code has more methods. Is it safe
to assume the CLI does more processing to come to the same conclusion?
That seems counter to the performance difference we have all seen. I am
sure to have missing something :)

It would greatly benefit myself and perhaps others if there was
something (non-microsoft) published on .net in the embedded world.
Perhaps the mono survey results will indicate how large of interest
there is in the subject.

Again, thank you for your explanation Jon, that was great!

Darren
