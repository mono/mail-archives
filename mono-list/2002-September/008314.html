<PRE>If you want to know what my preference are. It would be to have a
working Gtk# under windows. This way, I could start working on a GUI
program that requires some of the unfinished libraries (XML, etc.) under
.NET and be confident that my program will work properly under Linux as
soon as they are done. 

Having SharpDevelop act as a GUI designer for Gtk# would be great too,
but that's not mono's job :)

Hello!

&gt;<i> Is there any plan to port mono to commercial Unix platform such as HP
</I>&gt;<i> Tru64, Sun Solaris?
</I>
Ximian is committed to build at least the Linux/x86 JIT engine, and help
others in porting to other systems.  Currently am trying to find out how
we should allocate resources on the Mono team, and it would be useful to
know what people actually need.

I understand that some people might find Tru64 JIT support useful, but
maybe VB.NET would benefit more people.

That being said, if your company is interested in hiring Ximian to
support your favorite platform, we are interested in knowing about this.

I should probably write a poll or something.

Miguel
