ugh. sorry, no trolling intended -- i thought the problem was already
self-explanatory for some people, since Dan Lewis already wrote so much
code and telling from what's in cvs, i'm sure he's aware of the problem.
i thought it might have already been discussed at some point.
just did not find any hints in the archives yet.

so regexes can be precompiled. i guess the .net sdk delivers some
userspace tool or some other kind of support to do this. i've just tried
the class library representation.

attached are two programs:
1. &quot;regex2.cs&quot;, which when run creates a compiled regex in &quot;regex.dll&quot;.
2. &quot;regexusage.cs&quot;, which shall be linked against the precompiled regex
from step 1.

i like it, and i guess i'm not the only one. unfortunately, the contents
of regex.dll depend on a bunch of protected fields and methods in Regex
and, worse, the exact nature of System.RegularExpressions.RegexRunner.
Which, as i assume so far, comes close to reverse engineering the entire
regex execution machinery not only functionally, but bit by bit.
verbatim.

my primary question so far is: while i never really saw the need to
refer to ildasm output for what i've ever committed so far -- this is
different. is it legally okay to write code based at least on dissing
those generated .dll files? honestly, i'm not sure.

dns
