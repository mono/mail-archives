Perhaps.  But this is not a problem since we'll have the winelib port of SWF 
and for those who will care and want to use a nicer framework... well they'll 
have choices.  The best of all worlds!

I agree. SWF is important to get developers to _start_ using the Mono 
platform.  My guess is once they grow comfortable with it, many of them will 
want to know what all the hubbub is with our toolkits and we'll see a slow 
but steady migration.  That is my hope anyway.
