<PRE>I really don't understand why forcing MVC would be bad.

Writing models such as StringListModel would give the average programmer
not wanting to understand MVC (is it really that hard?) a familiar
interface to lists.

Perhaps we shouldn't have pushed VB programmers into the OO age with
implantation inheritance?

If we're going to introduce them to OO, lets do it right...

</I>&gt;<i> I do not deny the usefulness of MVC, I've used it myself, but only
</I>when
&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> problem requires it. eg if you're linking a database table to a combo
</I>then
&gt;<i> it's obviously critical. In many cases I think it's overkill. Case in
</I>&gt;<i> point,
</I>&gt;<i> in VS.NET when you want to populate a combo with a fixed set of
</I>strings
&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;<i> simply use the items property list. You bearly have to use a brain
</I>cell to
&gt;<i> do that, why go to all the bother of putting together a MVC?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; An example using VS.NET would be like this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +Drag-Drop the ListBox onto the form.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +Drag-Drop the ArrayListModel onto the form.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +Set the &quot;Model&quot; property of the ListBox to the ArrayListModel.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +Configure the ArrayListModel with the list of data you want.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you do need to use a MVC on a listbox the option is there via the
</I>&gt;<i> datasource property (doesn't have a model property).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Windows.Forms gives you the best of both worlds. My only issue with
</I>&gt;<i> Windows.Forms is that it is still a bit immature compared to other
</I>&gt;<i> toolkits
</I>&gt;<i> but other than that I don't quite understand why people complain about
</I>it.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm only thinking that it would be unfair to hoist one mode of
</I>thinking on
&gt;<i> to every one else, when in fact we could have both approaches, then
</I>you
&gt;<i> wouldn't alienate anyone. You'll get on board those who like to fiddle
</I>and
&gt;<i> the rest who just want to get the job done. Critical mass is important
</I>in
&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> GUI develpoment community so that we get a vibrant group of people
</I>&gt;<i> develpoing components. The Delphi and VB communities have a huge
</I>developer
&gt;<i> base, the volume of ready made free and commerical components is
</I>immense.
&gt;<i> Part of the reason for this is that it's easy to program in these
</I>&gt;<i> frameworks, the environments allow one to develop on many different
</I>levels,
&gt;<i> from simple drag and drop all the way down to assembler. Sure you can
</I>do
&gt;<i> MVC
</I>&gt;<i> if you want but if the problem is so simple, it's nice that you don't
</I>have
&gt;<i> to.
