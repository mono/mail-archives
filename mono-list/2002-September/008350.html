 As a VB6 Developer myself, I find VB.NET simply not interesting than
learning C#.
 It would be worthwhile to concentrate on efforts to run mono on
different architecture than implementing VB.NET.

&gt;<i> Why worthwhile? It's just to be able to support the two main
</I>programming 
&gt;<i> language. And think about somebody who downloaded the binary of a .NET
</I>&gt;<i> program made in VB.NET. He'll be unable to run it under Linux using
</I>Mono.

 Also, Microsoft might find issues with mono having a VB.NET compiler as
it is still their proprietary language(Not an ECMA standard unlike C#
and ECMA script.)

 It would be a huge risk. Microsoft can change the VB.NET language
syntax any time they want. You would have to catch up with it if you
want it to be usable.

&gt;<i> I don't know if there're risks making the compiler, however there're
</I>no
&gt;<i> risks making the run-times. Why should they modify the syntax? VB6
</I>&gt;<i> programmers are already so confused, I don't think they'll do that.
</I>
 Developing a CLI-Compliant language that's based on Basic is a
different thing than to create an exact copy of VB.NET.

&gt;<i> Why do you want to make a new Basic language, we can copy make a copy
</I>of 
&gt;<i> VB.NET (using another name :) ), else people will be a bit confused.
</I>
 In any case what attracts people to VB.NET is the RAD GUI Designer. If
we have one such thing for mono C#, the problem is solved.

&gt;<i> Yes, the GUI is nice, however I code in VB.NET instead of C# because
</I>the
&gt;<i> language is easier and faster to coding.
</I>
