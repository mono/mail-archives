Honestly, i just didn't know whether or not it was going to be the
official module, if the mono folks wanted to/want to develop something
different, then its their right to call it mod_mono.  If this ever does
become accepted into the mono project, I'll happily name it anything
that people want...

As far as why mod_haydn?  Haydn was a composer that used a bunch of C#'s
(at least the music I've listened to). :)))

That depends, I'm not sure, from my side, it simply wraps around the
Apache API, and runs within Apache.  However, I do remember reading that
quite a bit of work on mono and aspx (ASP.NET) has been done--It should
be relatively simple for these two to be integrated, simply directing
output to Apache, rather than directing output to [wherever it currently
goes].  The Apache module offers two functions for this:

Apache.Browser.Write (&quot;Hello World!&quot;);

and 

Apache.Browser.WriteLine (&quot;Hello World!&quot;);

The first will directly output the string passed to it (the equivalent
of puts() in C).  And the second will output the string, and then an
XHTML compliant &lt;br /&gt; tag (the equivalent of puts(&quot;str&quot;); puts(&quot;&lt;br
/&gt;&quot;)).

You can also flush the output to the browser via:

Apache.Browser.Flush();

I can also work with [whomever leads that effort] on adding any
functions that they'd need for ASP.NET, aspx, [insert further buzzwords
here]. :)

From my perspective (wearing my other hat), I'm a PHP developer, so I
might not exactly _help_ out directly on the effort to push ASP.NET,
but, everyone is free to use what they want, And I'll certainly do what
I can on the Apache module side....
