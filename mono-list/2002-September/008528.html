Hello!

I think that there are a lot of GUI APIs growing (GTK#, QT#, Xsharp,
...). That's good because people can choose whatever fits their needs
(that is not always the best, but sometimes the easiest to learn). 
Some peoples think that the target should be a very structured and well
formed API.
What I think is the most important target is to implement an API that
can be used by as many developer as possible without having to learn
anything.

I think that System.Windows.Forms fits this description. Maybe the most
intelligent way should be (and I think that is the way the Mono project
is growing) to implement the Linux APIs in C# (GTK#, QT#, ...) maybe
because it is easier and faster to implement. And when they are getting
mature, implementing System.Windows.Forms by the way they think is
better (WineLib is a good choice) even do it is not completed, but
usable, and make it pluggable enough to another people implement a SWF
bassed on GTK#, QT#.

Summary:
--------
- Implementation of Linux existing API's is good because they have the
expected looking and because they are easier to implement and maintain.
- Implementing System.Windows.Forms is good because many people is
already using it.

I think the most important thing is the number of users of Mono, because
if many people use mono, there will be many developers. And if there are
many developers it will be grow very fast and most APIs and ports can be
done.

Just what I think (in case anyone want to know).

Asier
