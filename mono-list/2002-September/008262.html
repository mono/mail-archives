<PRE>&gt;<i> I think the garbage collector is a more worrisome problem for writing

</I>
You are right, the garbage collector is a problem. The code we will execute 
under real-time conditions is somewhat constrained in the way it allocates 
memory. We hope that this can be used to prevent a garbage collection to 
occur for threads being executed in real-time. 

Of course, we still need to do some research in this area. Carl, do you know 
of some useful references on real-time garbage collection? 

I was not yet able to look at the gc interface of Mono. How difficult would 
it be to switch from the currently used Boehm-Weiser collector to a different 
one? Could this be done for single domains or threads?
