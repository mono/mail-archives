<PRE>Hello everyone,

I'm not sure where to go with this for opinions that I am confident with on this matter. I work for a software firm that specializes in Financial Messaging software. We work hard to make sure that our solution can be integrated well regardless of a clients environment. For this reason we have looked at .net with a hopeful eye to finally let us provide a single solution to the entire Microsoft camp. 

We are neither detractors nor supporters, but implementers of the technologies our clients ask for. It has been our stance however that the dotnet framework is still to early in its life cycle to even think about writing secure, financial applications on top of. There are a number of reasons for this, but the most important is that the API seems to still be in state of flux and may require clients to write and rewrite solutions. Is this opinion correct and would any one out there consider building a system that needs to be running 24x7 on .net at this point.

Thank you very much for your thoughts on this.
