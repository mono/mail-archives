<PRE>It's not so much that it's hard it just that I think it would be really
tedious to have to use an explcit MVC model every time you just wanted a
simple dropdown list. For some people it really is just a little bit too
much for them, or rather they don't want to spend the time learning about
MVCs because there are so many other things going on, they would rather use
a shotcut that does the job just as well. Computer programming is both an
academic persuit as well as a practical tool for solving real world
problems, at the interface between the two, I think we sometimes have to
make compromises, the purists might not be too happy but it makes the
practical application of the technology so much easier. Adding an items
property to a list box is not that bad is it? You still get your MVC.

&gt;<i> I really don't understand why forcing MVC would be bad.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Writing models such as StringListModel would give the average programmer
</I>&gt;<i> not wanting to understand MVC (is it really that hard?) a familiar
</I>&gt;<i> interface to lists.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps we shouldn't have pushed VB programmers into the OO age with

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I do not deny the usefulness of MVC, I've used it myself, but only
</I>&gt;<i> when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem requires it. eg if you're linking a database table to a combo
</I>&gt;<i> then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it's obviously critical. In many cases I think it's overkill. Case in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; point,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in VS.NET when you want to populate a combo with a fixed set of
</I>&gt;<i> strings
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; simply use the items property list. You bearly have to use a brain
</I>&gt;<i> cell to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do that, why go to all the bother of putting together a MVC?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; An example using VS.NET would be like this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; +Drag-Drop the ListBox onto the form.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; +Drag-Drop the ArrayListModel onto the form.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; +Set the &quot;Model&quot; property of the ListBox to the ArrayListModel.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; +Configure the ArrayListModel with the list of data you want.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you do need to use a MVC on a listbox the option is there via the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; datasource property (doesn't have a model property).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Windows.Forms gives you the best of both worlds. My only issue with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Windows.Forms is that it is still a bit immature compared to other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; toolkits
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but other than that I don't quite understand why people complain about
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm only thinking that it would be unfair to hoist one mode of
</I>&gt;<i> thinking on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to every one else, when in fact we could have both approaches, then
</I>&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wouldn't alienate anyone. You'll get on board those who like to fiddle
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the rest who just want to get the job done. Critical mass is important
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GUI develpoment community so that we get a vibrant group of people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; develpoing components. The Delphi and VB communities have a huge
</I>&gt;<i> developer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; base, the volume of ready made free and commerical components is
</I>&gt;<i> immense.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Part of the reason for this is that it's easy to program in these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; frameworks, the environments allow one to develop on many different
</I>&gt;<i> levels,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from simple drag and drop all the way down to assembler. Sure you can
</I>&gt;<i> do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MVC
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if you want but if the problem is so simple, it's nice that you don't
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to.
