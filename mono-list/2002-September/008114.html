<PRE>I believe Daniel is saying that the assemblies created by the API in
question call back into the MS RegEx libraries in an undocumented
fashion. Since those assemblies can concievably be 'compiled' using an
MS-based runtime and then consumed by a MONO-based runtime, the mono
runtime would need to support whatever API calls those assemblies make.

I have a feeling it would be possible to legally reverse-engineer the
generated assemblies without constraint (IANAL) and this should provide
enough information about the APIs that are being called without having
to reverse-engineer the MS assemblies themselves. I haven't looked too
deeply into this stuff, so I could be barking up the wrong tree...

Hello,


&gt;<i> this developer stuff gets compiled -- indirectly -- into dlls by the
</I>&gt;<i> runtime -- by developers.
</I>&gt;<i> dlls containing classes inheriting from System/ classes.
</I>&gt;<i> depending on System/ intrinsics.
</I>&gt;<i> dlls consecutively linked into programs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> while developers expect them to work -- well, at least i would.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> growing your would require recompilation for mono for any application
</I>&gt;<i> depending on regex support.  has .net compat been dropped from the
</I>&gt;<i> agenda and i haven't been notified?
</I>
Well, I do not understand as well as you do what the issues involved are
here.  Without digging deeper I believe that if things are opaque, we do
not ever need to depend on it.

You believe that my evaluation is wrong, so please explain us with more
detail what is the problem -because from your short message I could not
figure it out myself- and maybe we can investigate the problem that way.

Miguel
