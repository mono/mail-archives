<PRE>&gt;<i>Hi!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Having SharpDevelop act as a GUI designer for Gtk# would be 
</I>&gt;<i>great too,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but that's not mono's job :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If glade could be embedded, it should be trivial.
</I>&gt;<i>However, the effort to use bonobo in it, isn't even started (I think) 
</I>&gt;<i>and
</I>&gt;<i>it wouldn't work on windows.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Really, Gnome is missing an IDE with deeply integrated GUI 
</I>&gt;<i>designer.

Sur doing the switch over to GTK# is not mono's job:-)
And indeed we are looking into switching SharpDevelop over to 
GTK# as soon as that is functional on windows machines. But of 
course, this will

a) probably be some time in the future
b) .NET 1.1 and/or .NET 2 will possibly sport some other interface for 
GUI programming, making all our efforts at a forms desinger etc. 
obsolete
c) have to wait until we got our current road map done.

For now, we will just have to live with SharpDevelop on Windows 
being able to just do console stuff using mono.
&lt;hint&gt;If you want to help us out with getting SharpDevelop moved 
over onto GTK#, just holler&lt;/hint&gt;
c# ya,
