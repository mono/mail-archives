<PRE>I'm on the #develop team (and I know which UI frameworks are in development)

Having that said: we look at portability differently than other MS .NET 
developers (which are the majority), we are planning for it. But most 
developer don't. They don't care unless it is as simple as switching a 
compiler switch (like we are supporting Mono inside #develop). If they have 
to rewrite the application, at a minimum they will think twice and abandon 
the idea a second later.

You could start a poll for MS .NET programmers: given those four UI 
frameworks, which one would you choose to write apps when you'd plan for 
running on Windows and Linux? Guess what... next to no one would care about 
any framework other than Windows Forms.

Windows Forms is important to get MS .NET developers to use the Mono platform.

I was only commenting on the part &quot;If there is a better GUI toolkit and it 
could run on most platforms, most people will use it instead of WinForm&quot;.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; must be darn easy for MS .NET programmers to re-wire their apps for Mono
