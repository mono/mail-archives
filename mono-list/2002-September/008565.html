Because C# has been standardized by ECMA.  It's an open standard; anyone
can implement it.  (That's the theory, anyway.  We don't believe it to
be patent encumbered, but I haven't heard any recent news about our
patent questions from several months ago.)

VB.NET, JScript.NET, J# .NET, and Managed Extensions to C++ are not
standardized.  Microsoft provides language definitions for some of them,
but what the Microsoft compilers accept may differ from the
documentation.  (This has been mentioned before with regards to VB.NET;
check the archives.)

Thus, C# provides a more stable target, less likely to radically change
over time.

Of course,  many have a fundamental dislike of VB, or a fundamental like
of C-like languages (or both), and C#'s similarity to Java may be a good
thing to others...

</I>
Gtk# has a `Scribble' sample.  This might be what you're looking for.

&gt;<i> and can you explain why did you started this project (implement .NET in Linux)?

As /Richard said, check the FAQ at <A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/faq.html.">http://www.go-mono.com/faq.html.</A> 
Also check the rationale at <A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/rationale.html.">http://www.go-mono.com/rationale.html.</A>
 
&gt;<i> I need this information because I'm writing an investigation about this project... I hope (and I ask you) to reply this message before monday...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> By the way I congratulate you for this project... it's really cool...
