<PRE>Hi!

Hmmm ... some issues I have thought about:

(1) Systems.Windows.Forms (and related packages) is
probably the most important package in Windows to
implement.  A scrupulously accurate implementation
will be a hell of a lot of work, but rewarding.
(2) In a lot of ways, Windows (including SWT) is more
than just a GUI library.  It is an entire environment
and things work cleanly that way.  The more we try to
port the *entire* environment (code for
events/controls, window manager, desktop environment,
everything) the more likely we will have
cross-platform .NET apps.
(3) Qt would have been a very good thing, with the
native look and feel its able to emulate.  I noticed
that the only fee involved with Qt is development (not
deploymeny), which means that some company might want
to spend a lot of money in buying commercial Qt
licences for independent developers to work on a free
System.Windows.Forms implementation.

So, what do I think?  Emulate Windows faithfully
including all the elements but without the Win32 API
(the Windows.Forms API should be just enough ;) ).
Implement every element of Windows including:
(a) Window Manager.
(b) A deskop environment.
(c) The GUI code itself.

I believe its *best* to call Xlib's C functions
directly from mono and implement all extra
functionality within mono using Csharp (of course,
many unmanaged code hacks would be essential for
performance..)

Well, what do you think? (thoughts expressed at 79%
efficiency).  more to say...after I 'hear' what people
think about the above.
