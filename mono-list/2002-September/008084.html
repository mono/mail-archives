Hey Guyz,

I Had posted a follow up to the gcc .net messages but it stayed with the 
list admin for so long that byt the time it got into the august post the 
september message board was current. So 1st here is my original message

&gt;<i>Hey Guyz,
</I>&gt;<i>Ever since i posted the message about GCC .NET there's been quite some 
</I>&gt;<i>disscusion about it. So here's something to clear it up.
</I>&gt;<i>_______________________________________________________________________
</I>&gt;<i>1st
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>About tendra, in my last post about that i didn't mean not to go ahead 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;with it infact i think it would be a good idea to (when it gets C++ STL 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;support) modify it to accept Managed C++ and allow embeding machine code 
</I>&gt;<i>in CIL output etc. that would give mono an excellent managed c++ compiler   
</I>&gt;<i>   &gt;(although we sould make sure it supports unmanaged code etc. in short 
</I>&gt;<i>we should &gt;make it like the M$ MC++ compiler good for managed or umanaged 
</I>&gt;<i>c++. also i &gt;read somwherer that there was a ANDF producer for gcc but RMS 
</I>&gt;<i>had a problem &gt;with it and asked the creator to take it of his web site i 
</I>&gt;<i>don't know if he &gt;did but the problem is that i can't find the page again. 
</I>&gt;<i>but if there is &gt;one then we could use that and create a CIL producer that 
</I>&gt;<i>takes in ANDF &gt;and spits out CIL and that would solve both tendra and gcc 
</I>&gt;<i>being ported &gt;to .net
</I>&gt;<i>_______________________________________________________________________
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>2nd
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Zaphod said that my idea's a good one ecxept that gcj doesn't compile &gt;c++ 
</I>&gt;<i>(etc.) and jilc doesn't work. he also included the gcc faq from &gt;the 
</I>&gt;<i>portable .net project about why they did not use gcc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>here's my answer
</I>&gt;<i>Zaphod i've read that faq more than once before. And i said in my 1st &gt;post 
</I>&gt;<i>that we should modify the front ends c++ etc. to create gcj compatible 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;tree output etc.
</I>&gt;<i>however reading that faq gave me another idea egcs-jvm compiles other 
</I>&gt;<i>languages to JVM byte-code although the byte-code stinks bad javabyte &gt;code 
</I>&gt;<i>won't matter becasue the unstandard code etc. won't be unstandard in &gt;il 
</I>&gt;<i>bytecode. (Gaurav could i get your opinion on this).
</I>&gt;<i>And mono could get jilc fully operational, after all mono has a highly 
</I>&gt;<i>skilled team of hackers.
</I>&gt;<i>_______________________________________________________________________

Ok so anyway i got a reply from Zaphod on it he brought up some interesting 
issues. (Check out his post)

So anyway If we can't port GCC then i say we completly throw it out and make 
instead something like the backend we have for the C# compiler except that 
it can interface with all the gcc front-ends.

but before doing this we should definetly give gcc a try

and before that we should help tendra develop stl support and port it to 
emit .net code and allow embeding machine code and allow full Managed C++ 
support ...

Well Gotta Run
