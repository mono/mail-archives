<PRE>Miguel,  

If P/Invoke of the Win32 functions is not supported, then I think that
Mono's SWF implementation will be, for all intents and purposes,
useless.  I have not yet seen a single, less than trivial, .Net Windows
application that did not use several P/Invoke's to the Win32 libraries.


I'd understand not supporting P/Invoke into 3rd party libraries, since
you'd need to translate those.  But I'd think that at least the Win32
DLL's should be supported since most applications already use them.  

For example, anyone who is using a toolbar or menu control, other than
the included one, is relying on the ComCtrl32.dll library, among others.
Since the built-in toolbar and menu controls are pretty fugly and
feature-lacking, most people have chosen to use some other menu/toolbar
library.  Likewise, many applications make calls to set an XP Theme on
certain controls that the .manifest trick isn't enough for.  

In the end, if Mono's SWF implementation doesn't take all of those
P/Invoke's into account, then I don't think that many people will be
able to use it since their apps have external dependencies.  

I hope that you reconsider.

Regards,

--Oren

</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Since the current consensus is that SWF will be using WineLib as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; base, does that mean that developers don?t have to worry about their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; P/Invoke calls to Win32 functions not working on Mono?  I.e., if my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; app calls Shell32 or User32, it?ll still work since that?s a part of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; WineLib.  Would that also extend to Shdocvw.dll (a.k.a., MSIE?s COM
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interface)?  Many programs use IE (via Shdocvw.dll) to display HTML
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and to provide a WYSIWYG editor.  Would calls to it via P/Invoke,
</I>COM
&gt;<i> &gt; and ActiveX be supported under WineLib?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would keep assuming that PInvoke is not a good idea, and wont be
</I>&gt;<i> available.
