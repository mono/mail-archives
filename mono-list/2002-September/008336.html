Subject: RE: [Mono-list] Platforms Mono will support?


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think having a VB.NET compiler has more significance than making
</I>&gt;<i> mono run on more platform.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mono already has a compiler, if we have two, it doesn't see much
</I>&gt;<i> difference. In the worst situation, we could compile VB.NET code under
</I>&gt;<i> MS VS.NET, and run it in mono, isn't it? 
</I>
Apart from ASP.NET pages writting in vb perhaps. The same argument could
be said for JS.NET too. But there isn't a working runtime for VB.NET in
any case. Still a working VB compiler is kinda required for ASP.NET


&gt;<i> However, if mono could run on more platform, it mould be very different.
</I>&gt;<i> Image your code could run on most platform, that is more exciting than
</I>&gt;<i> that you could write a program in another language, especially under the
</I>&gt;<i> condition that MS has already finished this work!
</I>
I agree mostly with your comments here, but perhaps we should look at
getting anything thats creatable by VS.NET to run under mono runtime
first. From Personal observations the mono project have most of the
common platforms nailed; i86, ppc, sparc, arm. &lt;troll&gt;True, there is no
VAX, HPPA, AS/400, S390 support, but I don't really think there is
much call for them ... certainly not in the scope of using .NET&lt;/troll&gt;

&gt;<i> I personally think mono should focus on the most fundamental problems.
</I>
Yes, I think we should get what we have working first, and not spread
ourselves too thinly.

&gt;<i> At last mono will have a VB.NET compiler, but I think mono has more
</I>&gt;<i> important things to do at this time.
</I>
:<i>-)
