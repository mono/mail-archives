<PRE>&gt;<i> Anyway, implementing windows.forms might help some windows guy port
</I>his
&gt;<i> application on Linux. However, to the Linux user it will look too
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;windowish&quot; and it might cause localization issues, etc.
</I>
Not really, you can always patch winelib to use your toolkit rendering
primitives so it &quot;looks&quot; native.

With Gnome moving to customizable keybindings (with Windows being the
default).  I do not really see a &quot;feel&quot; problem either.

&gt;<i> I think the original intent of the mono project is being lost. Miguel,
</I>&gt;<i> please correct me if I'm wrong. The original intent was to get a nice
</I>&gt;<i> set of development tools to write Gnome/Linux application with.
</I>
My objectives with Mono are different than other's peoples objectives. 
I want language independence and reusable components on Unix, which has
historically been something that we did with Gnome.  Mono offers a new
platform to achieve these objectives.

But Mono is not what I chose it to be, Mono is what the community
chooses it to be, and the community has very different interests: from
production needs, to training needs to research needs.  Ximian will
contribute to Gtk#, because that is where we see ourselves building and
supporting applications in the future. 

If I had more resources we would be developing every bit of the .NET
framework, and if I had even more, I would develop a lot of new things
on top of it, and with even more I would build a complete system on it. 
The survey though, points out that most people are interested in
Windows.Forms, and very few are interested in Gtk#/Qt#.

Miguel
