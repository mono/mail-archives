<PRE>Hi Michael,

A little history about harmless...
at the beginning I was looking for an open source
ORB implementation and I was not interested in start a new project.
I found only VBOrb, but the author does not want to support VB.Net;
I tried to modify it  and I found several problems to recompile VBOrb 
source code with VB7.
I also looked also at mono site and I exchanged messages with David Taylor.
.
I need to use c# to write client applications of an existing set
of servers that use CORBA. I am very near to obtain this result with 
harmless.
In several cases a pure CLR implementation is required.
But, related to your remarks, I think point b) is very important,
and I could contribuite on that. But this result seems to me very difficult
to achieve for mono/.NET VM. I have download Orbit2 and I will give a look.

A question about Orbit: why does not exist a mapping for java?

Thanks,
Sergio
