<PRE>I just thought you should know that Rhys is working on wrapping XLib too.  
Probably would make a lot of sense helping with this instead of duplicating 
it.  Just though i'd let you know,

Subject: [DotGNU]Xsharp and improved PInvoke support
Date: Fri, 20 Sep 2002 16:23:07 +1000
From: Rhys Weatherley &lt;<A HREF="mailto:rweather@zip.com.au">rweather@zip.com.au</A>&gt;
To: <A HREF="mailto:developers@dotgnu.info">developers@dotgnu.info</A>

I've been fixing a bunch of bugs in the compiler and engine
that should help make PInvoke call-outs smoother.

In particular, I found a nasty bug in the assembler/linker
that caused it to completely mess up the order of structs
with sequential or explicit layout.  This is fixed now.

I just uploaded a new version of Xsharp, which uses these
facilities.  I've got simple paint event handling working now,
which is very cool.  It's still not usable as a full-blown
GUI abstraction layer, but it's getting there.

<A HREF="http://www.southern-storm.com.au/download/xsharp.tar.gz">http://www.southern-storm.com.au/download/xsharp.tar.gz</A>

You will need the latest CVS version of pnet to build this.

Cheers,

Rhys.
