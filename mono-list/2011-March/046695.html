<PRE>You'll get nowhere in 2.6.
I couldn't get anything to work in 2.10 (including the latest, which
included &quot;additional WCF&quot; per Miguel.)

System.ServiceModel.Activation isn't there so you're pretty much screwed --
not that you'd be able to infer that from those increasingly useless &quot;what
interfaces are supported&quot; pages.

Likewise the MoMA tool is totally useless now. It has two modes: the first
one crashes, the second one displays false positives.

I paid $99 for the fancy version. Which was just enough to tick me off when
it didn't work, yet not enough for me to feel like I deserved any sort of
support or engineering attention.

Mono's 3.0 release needs to be everything that's promised -- and faster, too
-- or they might as well just shelve this whole concept. The cost premium
for managed Windows servers at cloud vendors is 40-70%. But Mono runs my app
2x slower.

So the tradeoff becomes the cost of dealing with the endless idiotic Windows
server maintenance issues versus the cost of dealing with the endless
idiotic Mono compatibility issues.

I can throw money at the problem and easily solve the first case. The second
case leaves me prisoner to awkward help pages, broken tools, vague roadmaps,
and snarky Novell developers chasing things that worked great on Windows
five years ago.
