<PRE>Hi !

I am on debian jessie (8.3) and have already installed mono-complete
according the instructions given here:

<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/linux/#debian-ubunt">http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/linux/#debian-ubunt</A>
u-and-derivatives

and there were no problem with it.
Today, I wanted to install the package monodevelop, but this failed:

Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 monodevelop : Depends: libmono-corlib2.0-cil (&gt;= 3.2.8) but it is not going
to be installed
               Depends: libmono-microsoft-build2.0-cil (&gt;= 3.2.8) but it is
not going to be installed
               Depends: libmono-system-runtime2.0-cil (&gt;= 2.4) but it is not
going to be installed
               Depends: libmono-system2.0-cil (&gt;= 3.2.1) but it is not going

               Recommends: libglade2.0-cil-dev but it is not going to be
installed
               Recommends: libgtk2.0-cil-dev but it is not going to be
installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

&gt;<i>apt-get install --fix-broken
</I>
dont change anything.

Then I registered, that the packages are updated and tried:

&gt;<i>apt-get upgrade mono-complete
</I>

Calculating upgrade... Some packages could not be installed. This may mean

The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 libmono-corlib4.0-cil : Depends: libmono-corlib4.5-cil (=
4.0.4.1-0xamarin1) but 4.2.3.4-0xamarin2 is to be installed
 libmono-i18n4.0-cil : Depends: mono-runtime (&lt; 4.0.4.2) but
4.2.3.4-0xamarin2 is to be installed
E: Broken packages

What should I do to fix the problem ??

Thanks,
Manfred
