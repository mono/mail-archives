<PRE>Hi Paolo

Attached is the example app, I run out of memory pretty quick using
this.

Please post a complete sample that can be used to reproduce the issue so
we can debug it.

Version 2.0+ of the runtime supports the
GC.AddMemoryPressure()/RemoveMemoryPressure() for this purpouse: call
the first when allocating the unamanged data and the second when
releasing it. We currently do nothing with this, but it's good to have
the stuff in place for when the GC will make its decisions based also on
this.
