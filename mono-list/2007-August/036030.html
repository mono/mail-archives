<PRE>Well if anybody with an account would like to create an account for me, I
would be happy to add some tutorials, especially on Gtk# where there is very
little in the way of tutorials except for basic hello worlds and simple
menus.

I know I could post here and let someone review and post it, but for some
reason I just don't see that happening. It doesn't look like the wiki gets
updated very often. Thats not a stab at the people who keep the wiki. I'm
sure everyone is very busy and it's a lot of work keeping up all the
documentation. But thats exactly why the wiki editors should accept the help
of the community when it's offered, like Sean and I are doing. Just telling
us &quot;Post it on the mailing list and we'll get around to it&quot;, seems, at least
to me, like a write-off. And since I don't really feel like any tutorials
here would ever actually make it to the wiki, it doesn't really inspire me
to take my time to write one that no one would ever see.

Why don't yall grant some accounts, and if they get abused, you could always
pull them...

Austin W.
