It would be good if that policy got written up on the wiki.  The wiki
pages regarding editing of content at:
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Mono_Documentation_Improvement_Project">http://www.mono-project.com/Mono_Documentation_Improvement_Project</A> seem
contradictory to the policy at hand.

It is your policy to set.  It would be good to document that policy on
the wiki.

Fair enough.  My personal experience has shown that as long as you have
anti spam engine enabled on your wiki (moinmoin has a good one, I assume
media wiki has something equivalent), just requiring self registering
accounts is enough to keep abuse out.

Given that it took 2 emails to mono-list to even get this thread
rolling, I'm a bit unenthused in it being a gating element in getting
access to the wiki.  I'd like to hope the guy behind me would have the
ability to fix my aweful spelling mistakes (which I am known to make
from time to time), without emailing here first. :)

Anyway, in the mean time, I'll be writing up the information on the
OpenSim wiki instead: <A HREF="http://openmv.org/wiki/MonoSqlite.">http://openmv.org/wiki/MonoSqlite.</A>  It will be
written in various small time chunks, so don't expect much for the next
week or so, but it will evolve over time.

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors
than zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
