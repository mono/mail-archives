<PRE>Hi all,

Recently I was thinking about building a XML-RPC Server based on MONO.

It's main purpose is to providing an easy-to-use interface for our
system.   You can think it as a gateway software which interpret
XML-RPC request to our inner system protocol.

Last week, I've talked with a BEA sales man about their Jrockit JVM.
He told me that any runtime  environment would slow done severely when
collecting garbage.  And even if Jrockit is the fastest JVM on the
world,  it still has that problem.

So, what I want to know is that, did someone succeed in some similar
job based on MONO?

Thanks.
