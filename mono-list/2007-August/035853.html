<PRE>Oh, you are so nice.

I didn't expected such a comprehensive explanation about GC for my
experience of technique discussion in mailing list.

In the last paragraph,  did you mean that I should reuse buffer or
object as much as possible to get a better performance on MONO?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Things are different with a GC, but not terribly: there are some
</I>&gt;<i> allocation patterns that GC's can deal with efficiently (lots of
</I>&gt;<i> short-lived objects), and others that are less efficient (e.g. objects
</I>&gt;<i> which are unreferenced soon after being promoted to Gen2 in .NET, as
</I>&gt;<i> Gen2 isn't collected very often, so the memory will be
</I>&gt;<i> occupied-but-useless for quite some time.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I'm quite sure you could do an XML-RPC server in Java or Mono or
</I>&gt;<i> anything else, but you'll have to design your algorithms to take your
</I>&gt;<i> memory allocations into account.  Re-using existing memory buffers might
</I>&gt;<i> be better, or always allocating new buffers might be better; it all
</I>&gt;<i> depends.  Check your GC documentation for more information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (For example, Microsoft blogs have suggested that you profile your app
</I>&gt;<i> and make sure you spend less than 10% of your CPU time in the GC.  .NET
</I>&gt;<i> has performance monitors to measure the CPU time.  If you spend more
</I>&gt;<i> than that, you'll see noticeable performance problems.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for Mono, it currently uses the Boehm conservative GC.  This means
</I>&gt;<i> that there is less overhead for collecting garbage -- memory isn't
</I>&gt;<i> compacted, for example, so you don't have to pay the time cost of a
</I>&gt;<i> moving collector -- but you also have the heap fragmentation problems of
</I>&gt;<i> malloc(3) -- you might have enough memory, but you can't allocate an
</I>&gt;<i> object because there isn't enough contiguous free memory.
