<PRE>Cheers Miguel

So what do I need to do to solve the problem?  How complex would it be
for me to sort out?  I need to get this platform operating as soon as
possible because I am trying to push Mono as an alternative to Java for
embedding in our systems.

Thanks for you help

Matt

Subject: Re: [Mono-list] Problem with Mono on Arm target

Hello,
 
&gt;<i> I have just completed cross compiling mono-1.2.4 for an Arm target 
</I>&gt;<i> (using the montavist pro 4 corss compilation toolkit that came with 
</I>&gt;<i> the development platform).  I had to do a number of hacky things to 
</I>&gt;<i> the configure script to make it work including '--with-gc=none' (I 
</I>&gt;<i> will try and sort this problem out later).  It all compiles now fine, 
</I>&gt;<i> but I have a problem when executing a simple test case that should 
</I>&gt;<i> output the current time.
</I>
This means that the floating point configuration for that OS/userland is
not supported by Mono.   This happens every time folks try to use it
with an unsupported configuration in exactly this location.
 
Miguel
