<PRE>Hi All
 
I have been playing around with the Moonlight implementation (building a
simple Flickr client) and have a couple of questions about the use of
Image.
 
 Either I am using it incorrectly, or there is a severe memory leak in
its implementation.  The way I am using it is to create two Image
objects, and fade between the two of them, repeatedly loading the next
image by calling SetSource(..) on the hidden object.  It appears that
the memory of previous images is never released.  Is this what is
expected, or is there a problem with the current implementation?
 
My next question is about garbage collection when the bulk of the
storage for an object is in native space (as I think it is with the
Image class).  I know I have done this before with Java and the garbage
collector never kicked in because the runtime was only aware of a small
amount of data being consumed by unreferenced objects (a reference to
the native data store).  I'm not sure if Mono uses a similar policy on
deciding if garbage collection is necessary, but this may cause a
problem for Silverlight apps in the future if it does.
 
Regards
 
Matt
