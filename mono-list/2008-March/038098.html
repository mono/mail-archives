I didn't really care about libgps, never used it, so I can't tell.

I was just astonished by your saying, AFAYK, Mono didn't support  
pthreads, because:
* Mono links to it on many if not all non-Windows systems
* two years ago the LMF code was updated to cope with external pthread  
callbacks into managed code
* the 7.x branch of the Boehm GC appeared to have dropped support for  
non-posix threading packages

So are you implying there are some cases (apart from Windows) where a  
MonoThread/System.Threading.Thread is not a pthread but some non- 
pthread userland thread, like in Java IIRC? Or what did you mean by  
&quot;doesn't support&quot;?
