You have to implement all these features yourself.

Startup services are not part of mono-service. You must provide your
own startup scripts. Search the list for samples, as this topic has
been already discussed a couple of times.

I'd host those jobs inside their own XSP process (to decouple them from
the web site [if any]) and access them via Web Services.

Another approach is using a service + remoting for IPC.
