Good idea. Hyperthreading almost never works well. Intel had a good idea there. but the theoretical advantage is small, and by faking the OS into thinking you have full extra cores it causes the execution threads to be allocated poorly. 
 
True multicore processors don't have this problem (all the new chips are good). They have full extra cores and each core can run a separate thread. I don't think Intel is still making new Hypercore CPUs (at least I hope not).
