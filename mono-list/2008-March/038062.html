<PRE>Hi Lee,

The two choices we support most for Mono is winforms and gtk#.  Both 
work excellent on their native platform (winforms: win32, gtk#: linux) 
and work pretty well on other platforms.  Gtk+ (the native library 
behind gtk#) has been ported to win32, Mono's winforms is a managed 
implementation written in C# that runs on linux.  Neither is a &quot;least 
common denominator&quot; approach.  Both have excellent support and will be 
around for many years.

There are also some other toolkits you can use like wx and QT, though I 
am not particularly familiar with either.

<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Gui_Toolkits">http://www.mono-project.com/Gui_Toolkits</A> has some pros and cons of each, 
and links to some more information.

Its a tough decision where the 'right' answer is different for different 
people, so providing information is about all we can do.  Good luck!

Jonathan
