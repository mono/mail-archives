This question is perhaps less about mono-service, and more about the .NET
ServiceProcess. The benefits are auto-startup, restart on failure, logging,
etc.  

Does hosting my application within a Windows Service (ServiceProcess) buy me
anything else? Like thread handling, concurrent connections, or do I need to
implement those myself?

Within the context of mono under Linux, how does mono-service interact with
the OS. In other words, how do I define the startup/authentication/logging
for mono-service.

I realize the question is vague, so if anyone can provide a few links, or
even key-words to google, I'd appreciate it. Thanks in advance.

PROJECT DETAILS:
I'm running a message-receiver on linux, which accepts an ant project and
invokes it. With regards to the transport, I considered running an xsp/xsp
web service. But some of the processes I'm running are massive, consume
loads of cpu/memory and can take hours to run. I don't want to invoke them
within a web-application, though if anyone disagrees with this concern I'll
gladly stand corrected.  Its the sort of thing that WCF is intended to
handle, but that's not an option right now. 

At this point mono-service seems like the best option, but I'm not sure.
