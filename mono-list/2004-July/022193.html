<PRE>Hello!

&gt;<i> I don't know why I am asking about this, but wasn't there a plan for
</I>&gt;<i> smaller ECMA profiles for things like mobile devices?  When I attended
</I>&gt;<i> a .NET user group meeting a few months ago this seemed to be a major
</I>&gt;<i> point of interest among the existing .NET users there.  Forgive me if
</I>&gt;<i> I missed an obvious answer somewhere.
</I>
There was a plan, but it never quite matured, it really needs someone
with the interest to drive that process.

One of the problems with the Compact Framework is that it defines what
someone thought would be a good subset, and it typically has lots of
things that you do not need, and it lacks things that a lot of people
would like to have.

What we have been considering is a tool that would take as input a set
of classes and methods that are required, and the tool would generate a
new DLL with everything required.

It would pull those types and any dependencies required to satisfy that
dependency, and would operate entirely at the assembly level, without
any source code level changes.

This, I feel is a better way of creating embedded versions of Mono than
having ifdefs everywhere.

That being said, for people that need even more, it is possible that
certain dependencies would have to be manually removed, but in general I
think this is a direction that I want to pursue for embedded versions of
Mono.

Miguel.
