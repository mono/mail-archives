Yes

We'll have to disagree on that point. I think that the look and feel 
problem is secondary to the requires X11 problem.
Look and Feel can be worked around to a large degree with a decent port
and an aqua-ish theme. GTK-OSX used native components in a couple of 
area's (buttons and checkboxes) which helps a great deal.

With X11 GTK# you're going to have to explain what

Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display:

means to a million OSX users and why OSX users need to run
open-x11 mono myapp.exe {I get -bash: open-x11: command not found ??}
or start X11.app (where's that ? / Oh I didn't install that) first
and then run mono myotherapp.exe

That's going to annoy OSX user's that are used to things 'just working',
and put off OSX developers.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (Alternatively, you could use one of those widget toolkits that
</I>&gt;<i> implements a native UI on any platform. But Gtk isn't one of those.)
</I>
Which is my point, if Ximian / Novell are serious about pushing GTK#
as a primary alternative to the .NET framework with regards to Macs
as well as Linux and Windows then its needs to be 'one of those'.
