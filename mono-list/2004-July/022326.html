<PRE>I had a few questions about ASP.NET as supported by
mono and apache.  In short, i'm considering using it
to write a commercial webpage and wanted to get
feedback from you guys on how good/bad of an idea this
is.

1) Is the ASP.NET mono sections + apache plugin &quot;ready
for primetime&quot; -- i.e., has this stuff been &quot;load&quot;
tested, is the security there, can it scale to handle
a fairly large website?  

2) Are any other non-hobby sites using mono's asp.net
implementation?

3) If the asp.net stuff is not ready for full blown
commercial websites....  any ideas on when that level
of robustness/security/load-handling will be there? 

4) From what i've read, ASP.NET is not covered under
ECMA specs and therefore is not as legally safe from
lawsuit from MS as the compiler/JIT/corelibs are.  So
would it be stupid to risk using mono's ASP.NET
implementation for a commercial venture -- i.e., too
risky legally?

I did read the FAQ and searched the last few months of
postings and didn't really see anything that answered
all of these -- hopefully i didn't miss anything to
obvious :)   I'm also aware that some of these
questions are not black and white and may not have an
answer at all -- regardless, i appreciate everyones
input and suggestions.

Cheers -
Ron
