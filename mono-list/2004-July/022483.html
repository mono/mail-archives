I believe I've solved my annoying problem.  It seems that the following
structure of directories will share session information.

/ - application login
/core
/foo
/bar

But I was doing the following, which definitely did NOT work.

/public - application login
/core
/foo
/bar

This does make sense - but the lack of documentation about any of this
is extremely annoying.  No where is this stated that I could find.  But
having thought about it, and related it to the way Web.config files load
it makes perfect sense.  

Any ways, BLAH.  Thanks.
