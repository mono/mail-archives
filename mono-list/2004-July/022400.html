<PRE>[This is a version of a mail I sent to mono-docs-list a few
days ago. The silence over there was deafening, so I'm posting
here as well. Replies to mono-docs-list are welcomed.]

Hi, my name's Shane, and I'm going to be spending some time
over the next few weeks revising and extending the existing
documentation. I plan to be focusing on the Gtk# API doc and on 
cleaning up the monkeyguide. However, I'm new to Mono, so I need 
other people's comments. Here's your chance to get your thoughts 
in and have someone else do the work. ;-)   

So, experienced (and not-so-experienced) developers: what do you 
think the documentation needs that it doesn't currently have? 
Erik's explained to me that the monkeyguide is targeted at   
two sets of developers: Windows/.NET -experienced developers 
who need to know about Mono, and Linux-experienced developers 
who need to know about .NET. 

How well do you think the existing monkeyguide addresses those users? 
What would make it better?

I'm already planning to restructure the whole document; I'll probably
pull the &quot;how to install&quot; stuff out to an appendix, for example, and 
make the first few chapters much more of a crash course in what Mono 
is and why you'd want to use it. I'm in the process of working up an
outline, which I expect to post once I've got my brain wrapped
around things a bit better. Again, please join mono-docs-list if
you care at all about this, as I expect there will be more discussion
there.
