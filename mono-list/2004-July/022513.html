<PRE> Hello!

It is problem which was solved by creating a tool called lazy linker ( or
similar name ) described by Serge Lidin book on ILAsm and available on
GotDotNet for download. It handles some of the issues when combining
assemblies (removal of duplicate assembly declarations etc etc) but is
unable to handle all of them and in particular any code using reflection to
work with assemblies.

Why not give it a try?

Cheers

Jacek

The short answer is that you don't.  At least not easily, not with the
standard tools.

If you *really* need to do this, you can always disassemble all the
assemblies, concatenate them into a single .il file, and compile the
single-file .il file into a .exe.

This is a brute force approach, and will likely require some modifications
to the .il to allow it to compile, but it might work.

Emphasis on *might*.  If any of the assemblies use Assembly.Load() or
Assembly.LoadFrom() with any of the other assemblies, this code will need to
change (as the assembly that would be loaded would now have a different
name).

Suffice it to say, this is a difficult problem, but can be done if your code
isn't too complicated.
