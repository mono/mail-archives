<PRE>I have always run into pretty fundamental problems while trying to
port my ASP.NET apps over to run on xsp. Much to the credit of
gonzalo, these issues have usually been fixed very quickly (and I've
supplied a patch or two as well), but I've always run out of time
before I could get my app functioning under xsp.

Solid ASP.NET support is very important to me within mono, ASP.NET 2.0
support is also going to be important to me soon.  Is this work for an
improved xsp/mod_mono taking place in the 'xsp' module, or in a
separate module? Is there a road map for xsp? Has there been any work,
or are there any plans, to support the ASP.NET 2.0 features?

How can someone like myself (who unfortunately is very spotty in terms
of time he has to contribute to mono) make xsp/mod_mono better? Are
there bite-sized improvements I could tackle?
