As it seems, every directory is assigned a cookie-session id used to tie
Session to an application/directory.  The problem is that if I travel
from one directory to another and check session its missing, because
HttpSession seems to be directory/application specific.  

This is very annoying.  Suppose you have an application (as I will soon)
where you have a Core module that supplies users, roles, etc and a
login.  From there you would travel to other modules which would of
course need to know that your logged in (a cookie works -
FormsAuthentication class).  But suppose I set your Member object into
Session within the Core module, the Foo module could not access it.  So
in fact I would have to check your cookie and retrieve again the Member
object associated to that cookie from the database.  Thus, an unecessary
call to the database, and two instances of the same object sitting in
session.  Its a data integrity nightmare!

Any ideas, suggestions solutions?

P.S. Sadly, this must be a web application.
