Because OpenOffice uses standard, xml-based formats for it's files, you
can very easy to things like mail merge, reporting, etc.  All you need
is xml parsing routines which are in the mono libraries.  Each
openoffice document is split into several xml documents includng style
and content.  Thus you can manipulate the content xml files and combine
that with the style xml to produce custom OO documents.  So unlike MS
Office, you don't need to imbed some huge COM object to manipulate the
documents.  

For an example of this, see
<A HREF="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-think15/">http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-think15/</A>

For an example app (not C# but illustrates the points) see
