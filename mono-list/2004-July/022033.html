<PRE>Hi Atsushi, Ian and all the other strategy guys!

&gt;&gt;<i> I could imagine that - if those bugs get reported to MS - Microsoft=20
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will fix some of them in a next version of the .NET framework. Till=20
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then, our highest priority should be to be 100% compatible to the MS=20
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> .NET framework behaviour and not to any other standards.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I have to disagree in some points:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>To be compatible to MS doesn't says that we cannot get better, please =
make a small difference here.

Our first goal should be that all those applications developed for the =
MS .NET platform should run from start without any problems.

Second, we are allowed to get better than MS by several points of view:

- as already suggested, we could enable a &quot;mono power mode&quot; as Ian =
described (first it should be the MS compatibility mode to ensure all =
applications from the MS.NET world are running fine). Here we can fix =
some behaviour which is know to the community

- Standards are important, but when you only believe on the pure =
standard, you're never allowed to use DVD+R/+RW drives or mediums ;-) =
That's why I recommend to accept that there might be some situations =
which should allow proper (reading) functionality even if the standard =
is not matched to 100 %.

- we are already better than MS because we've got a lot of additional =
goodies in our project (or associated projects), here only a few: =
Mono.Data with several great Providers for PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, =
DB/2; IKVM; Support of ALL IMPORTANT PLATFORMS: Windows, MacOS-X AND =
Linux

&gt;<i>     - Anyways most of .NET developers are ignorant of what
</I>&gt;<i>       breaks compatibility, by using &quot;\&quot; in path, using MSSQL
</I>&gt;<i>       specific operations etc.
</I>
Sure, there might be some developers which are only focussed to the =
Windows world and are using &quot;\&quot; instead of =
System.IO.Path.DirectoryCharSeparator. This will be the most often =
problem and we should find a possibility to wrap those paths when =
accessing files. If we get this working, we've won a lot!!

MSSQL specific operations are based on the database in the background. =
If you change your database, you will always get the problem with these =
things. When you created a stored procedure on PostreSQL, you hadn't got =
the chance to get it working on a MySQL 4 database. Oracle is using =
PL/SQL and there are some specific changes, too. =3D=3D&gt; If you change =
the database, there is ALWAYS the need to change your code, in =
principle.

But all the other traps from moving applications from the windows world =
to mono and its supported platforms should be closed. Or at least there =
should be a small tool which analyses the code for traps and suggests =
changes (maybe in a similar way as Microsoft's migration assistants or =
FxCop do).

Regards
Jochen

</I>&gt;<i>     - With that &quot;if&quot;, we cannot provide better solution than

</I>&gt;<i>       (That's extreme case? Yeah, but then we need certain lines.)

</I>
agreed. Having more compliant libraries than ms is a great selling point =
for mono.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - Even if Microsoft fixes such problems, they will keep
</I>&gt;<i>       old libraries lame, and thus &quot;compatibility problem&quot; will
</I>&gt;<i>       remain there and in the next stage users will demand to
</I>&gt;<i>       make .net 1.1 stuff as &quot;compatible&quot; with buggy old one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Moreover,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - We might lose some faithful developers that believes
</I>&gt;<i>       standard is important (well, I have to say am apparently
</I>&gt;<i>       such one of them that believes code is speech).
</I>
again - conformity to standards is important and if mono can do a better =
job than ms at this so much the better.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - Anyways most of .NET developers are ignorant of what
</I>&gt;<i>       breaks compatibility, by using &quot;\&quot; in path, using MSSQL
</I>&gt;<i>       specific operations etc.
</I>
hmm - I'd say thats a broad generalization. And even if its true it not =
a good reason for putting more obstacles than necessary in the path of =
developers writing x-platform .net code.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I don't intend to reject all standard-negative opinion but
</I>&gt;<i> want to draw lines between MS compatibility and standard conformance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't want to be a black sheep here, so many of the developers
</I>&gt;<i> believe that MS compatibility should take precedence at any time,
</I>&gt;<i> I'll post more complete &quot;fix&quot; and wait anyone apply to cvs. I'd
</I>&gt;<i> be glad to fix by myself if there is any rational reason.
</I>
The &quot;ms compatibility mode&quot; proposal introduced in another thread could=20
make a good compromise. There would be a certain amount of overhead but=20
it would make it easier to determine which exceptions/failures are=20
compatibility related and smooth the porting process. Similar to the way =

browsers like mozilla have an &quot;ie compatibility mode&quot; so that they can=20
display broken non-conformant ms allowable html but still make standards =

compliance a top priority. Having our cake and eating it too - with a=20
slight cost in complexity.
