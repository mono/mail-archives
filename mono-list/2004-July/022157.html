</I>
	If you are suggesting just leaving off the .exe, then I don't think
that really gets what's been suggested above, you couldn't just execute
&quot;foo&quot; as opposed to &quot;foo.exe&quot;.  You'd still have to do &quot;mono foo&quot;.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe that mcs can output file instead of file.exe just fine, and
</I>&gt;<i> mono should be able to execute file instead of file.exe without any
</I>&gt;<i> issues.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, mono will *still* need to execute file, its not magic.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We are writing software, not making rabbits jump out of hats.
</I>
	I don't know, mono seems like a pretty fine magic!

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regardless, I recommend manually wrapping it with a shell script, as
</I>&gt;<i> that allows you to put private dlls in your AppBase without
</I>&gt;<i> poluting /usr/bin with a bunch of .dlls. That is by far the best way to
</I>&gt;<i> go.
</I>
	It would be nice if there was a standard beginning wrapper that could
be used until or unless something more advanced is needed.

	Or maybe not even a script, there's got to be a better way.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But its a problem that has lots of different solutions. Pick the one
</I>&gt;<i> that works for you, and use it.
</I>
	I will end up wrapping stuff manually, but only because there doesn't
seem to be any enthusiasm for doing anything else.  I know, I know I
could try to add it myself, but I don't think it would get accepted.
