Amazing.  I didn't that Gtk itself was ported to Mac OS X.

Yeah, thought so.  I definitely want something free (both beer and 
speech).

I'll keep working with Gtk# for now.  I think that requesting a 15MB 
download for Mono is quite enough.  I don't want to ask people to install 
yet another dependency.

In fact, even the 15-20MB Mono download makes me hesitate.  I think it's a 
bit much considering that the program I'm doing is really simple.  It's 
just a clipart installer to complement OpenOffice.org.

I'm also looking into Mozilla/XUL.  If I get that to work I could possibly 
get the download down to 5MB (this is the size of Firefox).  The drawback 
with XUL is that the app would be somewhat more difficult to develop (e.g. 
Javascript instead of C#).

Cheers,
