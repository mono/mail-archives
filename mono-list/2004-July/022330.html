<PRE>In answer to your question #2, I run a site that we launched a couple
of weeks ago (www.edcomp.com) using asp.net and mono. Right now it is
getting 2000 visitors a day and 5000 page views. So it's not a hobby
site but not a full commercial site either.

So far there have been some problems, but nothing that I would
consider too severe. I have run into problems where it appears that
the mod_mono_server is not releasing memory properly if left to run
too long. I end up having to shut down mod_mono_server once a week to
prevent it from crashing apache. I'm not sure why this is happening.

The other inconvenience is that I use code-behind. Right now
mod_mono_server does not recognize changes to the assembly and won't
load the new assembly unless you kill and restart the server. I have
heard that there is a patch that makes it so you only need to restart
apache to get the changes, but I haven't installed it yet.

I have been using mono for asp.net for about 5 months now and have
been really impressed. I prefer using asp.net on a Windows machine,
but where I am limited to using Linux it works great.
