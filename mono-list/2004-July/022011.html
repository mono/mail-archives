</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I have to disagree in some points:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - With that &quot;if&quot;, we cannot provide better solution than
</I>&gt;<i>       Microsoft *at any time*. Also, to conform to that &quot;if&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i>       we have to make libraries vulnerable as well as Microsoft.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       (That's extreme case? Yeah, but then we need certain lines.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       And if we just follow Microsoft, it won't fix any problems
</I>&gt;<i>       in their libraries, since there is no better competitors.
</I>
agreed. Having more compliant libraries than ms is a great selling point 
for mono.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - Even if Microsoft fixes such problems, they will keep
</I>&gt;<i>       old libraries lame, and thus &quot;compatibility problem&quot; will
</I>&gt;<i>       remain there and in the next stage users will demand to
</I>&gt;<i>       make .net 1.1 stuff as &quot;compatible&quot; with buggy old one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Moreover,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - We might lose some faithful developers that believes
</I>&gt;<i>       standard is important (well, I have to say am apparently
</I>&gt;<i>       such one of them that believes code is speech).
</I>
again - conformity to standards is important and if mono can do a better 
job than ms at this so much the better.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - Anyways most of .NET developers are ignorant of what
</I>&gt;<i>       breaks compatibility, by using &quot;\&quot; in path, using MSSQL
</I>&gt;<i>       specific operations etc.
</I>
hmm - I'd say thats a broad generalization. And even if its true it not 
a good reason for putting more obstacles than necessary in the path of 
developers writing x-platform .net code.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I don't intend to reject all standard-negative opinion but
</I>&gt;<i> want to draw lines between MS compatibility and standard conformance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't want to be a black sheep here, so many of the developers
</I>&gt;<i> believe that MS compatibility should take precedence at any time,
</I>&gt;<i> I'll post more complete &quot;fix&quot; and wait anyone apply to cvs. I'd
</I>&gt;<i> be glad to fix by myself if there is any rational reason.
</I>
The &quot;ms compatibility mode&quot; proposal introduced in another thread could 
make a good compromise. There would be a certain amount of overhead but 
it would make it easier to determine which exceptions/failures are 
compatibility related and smooth the porting process. Similar to the way 
browsers like mozilla have an &quot;ie compatibility mode&quot; so that they can 
display broken non-conformant ms allowable html but still make standards 
compliance a top priority. Having our cake and eating it too - with a 
slight cost in complexity.
