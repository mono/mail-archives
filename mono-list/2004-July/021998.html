It's not FUD, it's just the reality: if people think that using pnet is
safer wrt a possible trojan injected by MS, they are deluding
themselves (and showing they don't know much about security).

&gt;<i> There is no possibility whatsoever that Microsoft could have injected

</I>&gt;<i> pnet does not require already having a C# compiler or a &quot;corlib&quot;.
</I>
This doesn't matter, see below: the problem is that the systems where pnet 
were built (just as mono) ran untrusted code compiled by the MS csc.

Unless the C compiler (for example) was trojaned by the Console.WriteLine()
implementation (emitted by the hyphotetical trojaning MS compiler) when
the first tests were run with pnet. So the moment you ran untrusted code
on the system, it doesn't matter if you bootstrap from C or from C#.

Just as a summary, since people seem to be sensitive about these issues:
*) I don't think MS has trojaned either mono or pnet
*) if they could have trojaned mono, they could have done the same to pnet
*) since the trojaning of both systems is theoretical it's not easy to
say which one of the two could be more likely, but feel free to discuss
it in the <A HREF="mailto:paranoia@forever.com">paranoia@forever.com</A> list:-)
