There is no FUD here. You have a history of paranoia and friction with the
Mono project and its managers. Never did Miguel actually suggest that
either project was trojaned. He merely stated the possibility, and you
immediately and emphatically denied even that possibility. However, anyone
with a basic understanding of security and compiler technology can see that
it IS possible. It is possible, but it hasn't actually been done. All that
Miguel said was &quot;no project is immune to tampering, hacking and trojan
horses.&quot;

I do not expect you to answer this message, because, as you said, this is
your last posting in this thread. Just, please understand that posts like
the one you have made here do not serve any purpose, except to annoy all
other people on this list, contributors or not, including those (and I'm
sure they exist) who are involved with DotGNU/Portable.NET.

Please stop fighting with us and get on with developing your project.

Jonathan
