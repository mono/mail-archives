<PRE>Hi,

you probably had this problem already, but there was no solution on the net,
so I'll ask it again.

I did a mono-1.0-complete install of the SuSE 9.0 rpms and got all the mono
stuff in /usr/lib/mono. The only thing I can't find is corelib.dll. There is
a mscorlib.dll in /usr/lib, but everytime I start mono with some program
(i.e. mcs.exe) it says that it can't find corelib.dll ('The assembly
'corelib.dll' could not be found...').
I tried to make a link from mscorlib.dll to corlib.dll but then mono brings
a rather large list of errors, all beginning with 'You mono runtime and
corlib are out of sync'. I had a mono-0.25 install on my machine before but
uninstalled it prior to installing mono 1.0.
There was nothing fancy during the install, no errors etc., I install it and
it doesn't work.

What is there to do?

Thx,

B.
