<PRE>Hi! I think you should take a look at hibernate.org. Hibernate is a very 
nice framework that I have worked with and it is definitly production ready.

It does support maps, as you ask for, but I'm not sure of what you mean with 
&quot;dynamic map&quot;...

also in Hibernate you define your mappings in xml files which eliminates the 
need to hardcode column names in your business objects and permits advanced 
types of mappings. (with &quot;permit&quot; I mean that you probably want to reduce 
the mapping information as you have choosen to put it in the business 
objects)

It's not a .NET framework but you should certainly be able to borrow some of 
their nice features:-)

</I>&gt;<i>Date: Fri, 30 Jul 2004 10:07:43 -0600
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Thanks for all your responses.  I comment on your questions and ideas 
</I>&gt;<i>below.
</I>&gt;<i>By the way, I didn't mention that my goal is to make this MS .NET designed
</I>&gt;<i>thing work in Mono.  It probably already does, I just haven't tried it.  
</I>&gt;<i>And
</I>&gt;<i>right now the only code I have that is database platform specific is
</I>&gt;<i>targeted at SQL Server, and a little code written for OleDb.  I don't know
</I>&gt;<i>if MySQL falls under OleDb or not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This quickly gets off mono topic.  I should create a mailing list here
</I>&gt;<i>shortly.  If you want to join, send me an email and when I make it I'll add
</I>&gt;<i>you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Gert Kello:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, could You please share You findings about OPF-s?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You might make my life much easier :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>OPFs that I have looked at fall short in what I need to do for two main
</I>&gt;<i>reasons:
</I>&gt;<i>1) All that I have seen seem to be performance-tuned for small to mid-sized
</I>&gt;<i>projects.  I don't know what classifies as a mid-sized project, but I have
</I>&gt;<i>potentially millions of rows in tables with several hundred columns.  I
</I>&gt;<i>believe that is beyond mid-sized.
</I>&gt;<i>2) They all seem to tie a property in a class directly to a column in a
</I>&gt;<i>table.  In a few of my classes, I have something akin to a Map (name-value
</I>&gt;<i>pairs) that are dynamic at run-time (within certain bounds), so columns in
</I>&gt;<i>the persisted tables may be added or removed, and I don't want v1 through
</I>&gt;<i>v500 properties to store various variables.  I'd rather have a map for 
</I>&gt;<i>them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>My design is different because it actually brings the business objects
</I>&gt;<i>slightly closer to the data-layer, while still keeping them out of the
</I>&gt;<i>actual data-access code.  Every business object class derives from a class
</I>&gt;<i>in Safari Cell.  The base class does all the grunt work of SQL code.  So,
</I>&gt;<i>for example, if your business object has a property to store the FirstName
</I>&gt;<i>of a person, the simplified class might look like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>class Person : Safari.Cell.Row // Row is the class for business objects
</I>&gt;<i>{
</I>&gt;<i>	private const string FIRSTNAME = &quot;FirstName&quot;; // column in database
</I>&gt;<i>	// ...
</I>&gt;<i>	public string FirstName
</I>&gt;<i>	{
</I>&gt;<i>		get
</I>&gt;<i>		{
</I>&gt;<i>			return (string) base[FIRSTNAME];
</I>&gt;<i>		}
</I>&gt;<i>		set
</I>&gt;<i>		{
</I>&gt;<i>			base[FIRSTNAME] = value;
</I>&gt;<i>		}
</I>&gt;<i>	}
</I>&gt;<i>	// ...
</I>&gt;<i>}
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>All the caching, persisting, and some of the validating of the new values
</I>&gt;<i>occur in the base class.  I say SOME of the validating because your 
</I>&gt;<i>business
</I>&gt;<i>object will usually have some custom validation code that it can put in 
</I>&gt;<i>that
</I>&gt;<i>accessor method.  In addition to custom code, the base class does the work
</I>&gt;<i>of making sure that a newly assigned string value does not exceed the
</I>&gt;<i>defined size in the SQL table.  That way, even though the new value is
</I>&gt;<i>cached in a infinite length string in memory, it will be guaranteed to fit
</I>&gt;<i>once persisted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>By now you see that there is no external mapping of objects to database
</I>&gt;<i>fields.  It is built into your business objects.  This provides the 
</I>&gt;<i>greatest
</I>&gt;<i>extensibility, and is part of what helps my design support massive 
</I>&gt;<i>databases
</I>&gt;<i>(both in row count and column count).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Ole Hyldahl Hansen:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have put some effort into finding a suitable solution but no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; acceptable free solutions exists (I could not find any...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I am probably going to release Safari Cell under the LGPL license.  X11 is
</I>&gt;<i>also rolling around in my mind, but I doubt that will do.  Ideas?
</I>&gt;<i>Preferences?  I'm against GPL because I don't consider that free, as
</I>&gt;<i>obligations come with it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Ole, the link you sent is excellent.  I am still perusing it.  My framework
</I>&gt;<i>does not match that list very closely.  Some of that is good, I believe, 
</I>&gt;<i>but
</I>&gt;<i>much of it is bad, and I would like to develop this project to fit that
</I>&gt;<i>criteria more completely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the following should hold:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DataObject o1 = Lookup (&lt;some primary key&gt;); DataObject o2 = Lookup 
</I>&gt;<i>(&lt;same
</I>&gt;<i>primary key&gt;); Assert (o1 == o2);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I would more explicitly make your last statement:
</I>&gt;<i>Assert ((object)o1 == (object)o2);
</I>&gt;<i>Since you can override the operator and make two object references that are
</I>&gt;<i>different look the same although they are not.
</I>&gt;<i>In answer to that question, yes, I use a hash table to track objects that
</I>&gt;<i>are read from the database so that repeated requests are read from the 
</I>&gt;<i>cache
</I>&gt;<i>and not recreated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Jon Watte:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you're running a multi-threaded application, and different threads
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do work as part of different transactions, then it's pretty clear
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that changes to o1 should NOT be visible in o2, unless the transaction
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that o1 was viewed as part of commits before you get o2. Transactional
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; semantics require this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I agree.  That is work yet to be done, but I think it will be fairly easy,
</I>&gt;<i>as you say.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I believe there is enough interest that I feel justified in making this 
</I>&gt;<i>open
</I>&gt;<i>source.  My hope is that contributors will make it more cross-platform and
</I>&gt;<i>more cross-database, and get some good design ideas from you all.  I have
</I>&gt;<i>never hosted my own open source project before.  If you have any
</I>&gt;<i>suggestions, please write.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>To tie this into Mono, I'd like to move into mono being a primary
</I>&gt;<i>development platform, but keep it working on both CLI runtimes.
