Thanks.

It's odd that I can't find this neither in Microsofot's class reference 
list, nor in Monodoc.  But that's okay, I just googled it.

Now, I just tried this on a Linux 2.6.0 kernel and the result was:

Unix 2.6.0.0

It looks like Mono doesn't distinguish between Linux and Unix.  Is that a 
bug?  Or is it in purpose?

I was hoping for more granularity.  I was hoping I'd be able to tell 
appart Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD and Solaris.

Thanks.  I'll try it out.

Cheers,
