<PRE>I'm writing an O/R mapper as part of my MS Thesis.

It's called Sooda (simple object oriented data access), features most of the
things you could expect from an O/R mapper (inheritance and query language
included).

Sooda is designed to be SIMPLE (both when creating the mapping and when
using the objects in your applications) and PORTABLE (works with Mono/.NET,
PostgreSQL, MySQL4, MSSQL, Oracle9). It's BSD-licensed with one GPL-ed GUI
component.

See:

<A HREF="http://sooda.sourceforge.net/en/examples.php">http://sooda.sourceforge.net/en/examples.php</A>

(the rest of the site is unfinished).

The package hasn't been officially released yet (expected in about 2 months
after I graduate and have some more spare time), but if anyone wants to try
it - contact me and I'll give you the read-only Subversion access to the
source code.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I know most are proprietary. I have put some effort into finding a

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; not find any. Please prove me wrong).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I have worked a little on something that sounds quite similar to what

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; be willing to help with the creation of a free solution.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm also about start a non-profit project where I want to use an OPF.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I did make a list from libraries present in <A HREF="http://SourceForge.net/">http://SourceForge.net/</A> So
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; far I have managed to review only Gentle.Net (Which didn't satisfy me)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, could You please share You findings about OPF-s? You might make my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; life much easier :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I must say that I never did any thorough evaluations.  I tend to
</I>&gt;<i> get frustrated with a many of the frameworks rather quickly, because
</I>&gt;<i> they often only allow you to download timelimited and/or crippled
</I>&gt;<i> demoversions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First let me point you to a discussion some months ago on usenet (hope
</I>&gt;<i> the link works :-):

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Someone defines his or her ideal framework and asks for something that
</I>&gt;<i> matches as closely as possible. Several frameworks are discussed here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is one framework that might be very good: <A HREF="http://www.llblgen.com">http://www.llblgen.com</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am a big fan of code generation and llblgen seems to generate nice
</I>&gt;<i> code. But as I understand it, they do not use a transaction-cache based
</I>&gt;<i> on object identity, which is something I consider essential. IMHO the
</I>&gt;<i> following should hold:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> DataObject o1 = Lookup (&lt;some primary key&gt;);
</I>&gt;<i> DataObject o2 = Lookup (&lt;same primary key&gt;);
</I>&gt;<i> Assert (o1 == o2);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is not the case with llblgen: Something like this is true though:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> DataObject o1 = Lookup (&lt;some primary key&gt;);
</I>&gt;<i> DataObject o2 = Lookup (&lt;same primary key&gt;);
</I>&gt;<i> Assert (o1.Equals (o2));
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> but if you change an attribute in object o1 is that change visible in
</I>&gt;<i> object o2? I think not and I would very much like that to be the case.
</I>&gt;<i> When I played around with this kind of stuff myself a basically created
</I>&gt;<i> a hashtable per transaction and cached all loaded objects in this
</I>&gt;<i> hashtable by their primary key. This way there can only exist a single
</I>&gt;<i> instance for each primary key (per transaction. Different transactions
</I>&gt;<i> sees different objects.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another possibility might be the .NET port of Hibernate  (NHibernate). I
</I>&gt;<i> do not know how mature it is, but I have heard Hibernate can be quite nice
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, I'm willing to share my findings about the ones You didn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; evaluate...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And to any other in list: Could You plase share You knowledge about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; diffrent free OPF-s.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If I do not find one that satisfies me, I'm thinking to roll my own
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one... Or, if there is one to be satisfying, I would gladly join the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; team.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; P.S. Note to the list adnministrator: Is there any reasons why the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reply-to address is not set to the list? I usually want to reply to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the list... And it is tedious to do recipient clean-up every time I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make &quot;Reply All&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> If you any good ones I would like to hear it, but I sort of gave up and
</I>&gt;<i> decided to see if I could come up with something by myself. However,
</I>&gt;<i> creating a good framework takes a lot of time, so a joined effort would
</I>&gt;<i> probably be better.
