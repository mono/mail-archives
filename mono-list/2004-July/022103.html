<PRE>Hi Andrew,
In System.Drawing namespace, work needs to be
done in System.Drawing.Design and System.Drawing.Printing
sub namespaces. 
Also we are left with some feature enhancements
and implementation of bits and pieces in other areas of System.Drawing

which are being looked into and getting implemented.

Thanx,
Sanjay

</I>Hi all,

I'm interesting in contributing to Mono, and having checked the website

for which classes require work, I've decided I would like to help on
the 
System.Drawing namespace, as it's an area I'm interested in, and also
as 
I have written quite a bit of code against the Microsoft
implementation.

So, having checked out what classes/methods are needing work, I'd like

to also ask the list if anyone else is working on it, or which sections

are more urgently requiring attention, so I don't tread on anyone's
toes 
and can be as useful as possible. Does anyone have any suggestions as 
for what to tackle first, or any areas which are best avoided?

Many thanks,

Andy
