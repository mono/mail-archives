Andrew, I am sure there will be great interest in such a project, juding 
from the large number of Object-Relationel Mappers. As far as I know 
most are proprietary. I have put some effort into finding a suitable 
solution but no acceptable free solutions exists (I could not find any. 
Please prove me wrong).

I have worked a little on something that sounds quite similar to what 
you are describing. I would very much like to see what you have produced 
so far, and if we are indeed persuing the same goal I will be willing to 
help with the creation of a free solution.
