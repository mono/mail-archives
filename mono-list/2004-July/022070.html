</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Unless the C compiler (for example) was trojaned by the Console.WriteLine()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implementation (emitted by the hyphotetical trojaning MS compiler) when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the first tests were run with pnet. So the moment you ran untrusted code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on the system, it doesn't matter if you bootstrap from C or from C#.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Even more FUD.  Even if (as you seem to imply) a hypothetical
</I>&gt;<i> trojaning MS compiler had trojaned early pnetlib builds in a way which
</I>&gt;<i> exploits some kernel security hole on GNU/Linux systems to gain root
</I>&gt;<i> privileges to modify the C compiler installation on that machine, that
</I>&gt;<i> would not have affected the binaries which we distribute today because
</I>&gt;<i> they're built on other machines which have probably never received
</I>&gt;<i> _any_ binaries from the machines where the early tests were done.  (If
</I>&gt;<i> in your opinion the &quot;probably&quot; above isn't good enough, let me know; I
</I>&gt;<i> can easily enough do a round of builds on machines where I can guarantee
</I>&gt;<i> this to be the case.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Just as a summary, since people seem to be sensitive about these issues:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *) I don't think MS has trojaned either mono or pnet
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *) if they could have trojaned mono, they could have done the same to pnet
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *) since the trojaning of both systems is theoretical it's not easy to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; say which one of the two could be more likely, but feel free to discuss
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it in the <A HREF="mailto:paranoia@forever.com">paranoia@forever.com</A> list:-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do think that the (at least theoretical) possibility of trojaned
</I>&gt;<i> self-compiling compilers should be on the &quot;long list of potential
</I>&gt;<i> issues to take into consideration&quot;.  I do not think that it is
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate to single out MS as the only potential attacker.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe that good security can be achieved only by taking into
</I>&gt;<i> consideration all possible attacks from all possible attackers.  Is
</I>&gt;<i> the Mono project leadership in disagreement with this view?

Just out of curiosity, who the hell cares?

Neither one is trojaned. Lets just move on.
