I'm not paranoid, I'm trying to understand *exactly* how Mono was written. 
Although, if it was written in Assembly I'm going to run in fear! ;-)

&gt;<i> Mono, the runtime wasn't written in C#, was it? If so, is it reasonable
</I>&gt;<i> to expect to boot-strap mono something like this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) build MCS using .NET on Windows
</I>&gt;<i> 2) build the runtime
</I>&gt;<i> 3) use the output of 2) to run the output of 1) to self-compile
</I>
Yeah, that would be fine.  I can't download blackbox binary to compile Mono and
do a full security review.  I'd like to see more core of core, and build it from
there.

If this isn't possible, perhaps one of the Mono developers could [sideline?]
discuss with me what was done.

I want the chicken *and* the egg!  One or the other will not suffice! ;-)
