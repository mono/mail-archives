<PRE>Ok I am still trying to get all of the pieces functioning, I downloaded
red-carpet for the suse installation ( I'm running SUN Java Desktop 2 )
and got everything started per Novell instructions
pointed red-carpet at the directory that had all of the unzipped rpm's
from the full suse distribution of mono.  and when I run red-carpet it
fails on a winlib dependency even though I have a working version of
wine ( latest rpm version ).  I checked my system and yes it is there.  
I even tried to compile winelib from the tar source in case there was a
version problem and it bombed saying it can't find a windef.h file
during the configure stage.  

So red-carpet was a total failure.

Here is what I get when I run an rpm -iv *rpm on the directory 
containing all of the rpm files (including
wine-20040615-SuSELinux80.i386.rpm )


error: failed dependencies:
        cairo &gt;= 0.1.22 is needed by mono-cairo-0.96-1.ximian.0.2
        winelib &gt;= 0.2 is needed by mono-winforms-0.96-1.ximian.0.2


Since all cairo files should be in the directory ( I pulled the full zip
) what's going on here?   Any help would be appreciated.

Also if any of the developers of mono can tell me if any &quot;stock&quot; Linux
distribution have all of the necessary non-mono rpm's or libraries
already loaded it would be appreciated.  I'm ready to pony up the money
to get this to work.
