<PRE>Hi all,

Mono 1.0 was shipped awhile ago, and I'm really excited
about that... but now the natural question is:

  &quot;Is Mono ready to compete with MS .NET in real business?&quot;

... and one more question is

  &quot;Will Novell provide support, documentation, etc.?&quot;
  &quot;If yes, by when?&quot;

These two questions are quite important: companies
cannot decide for Mono just because Mono is a nice
project!

Behind MS .NET there is a huge development team,
support, documentation, and continuity... and I
think Novell should offer the same, but till now
I don't see anything in that way.

You guys at Novell, could you tell us something more
about your plans to push Mono into the market as an
effective MS .NET alternative?

I hope not to hurt you all! I'm just trying to understand
whether or not Mono is the right choice for our business.

Regards,
