hello all.

well, when i first started to use Mono, i liked the idea of embedding the 
runtime into my application. however, i believe that i made a mistake in 
interpreting this. one still has to have Mono installed on the target 
machine. (i tested this on two different Linux boxes.) however at this 
link: <A HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/grantri/archive/2004/06/01/145724.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/grantri/archive/2004/06/01/145724.aspx</A> there is 
some talk about single file assemblies in the near future. will Mono 
support this as well? the reason that i have not switched to Mono entirely 
is because of the extra runtimes required. for broadband users, it is no 
problem. but for dial up people as mentioned in that post, Mono and/or .NET 
runtime weighs in very heavily. there are programs that merge all the code 
required into one file, but i do not want to pay for extra licenses of 
software i may or may not use. there is already software to merge multiple 
.NET assemblies into one, but not also statically link it with the runtimes 
(or unmanaged code for that matter).

this is a quote from Grant on that link above: &quot;You can now have a single 
file assembly witc, VB, C#, C++, and even native code all in one 
file!  Theoretically you can even link classic static .LIBs into your brand 
new C# assembly (although I've never tried that specifically).&quot;

that would be the best thing next to Mono and Windows.Forms itself.

best regards,
joe
