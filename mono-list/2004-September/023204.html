Well, you could always ship encrypted assemblies, decrypt the assemblies
at runtime, and use Assembly.Load() on the decrypted bytes.  Of course,
this doesn't protect against anybody running your app inside of a
debugger, trying to sniff for the decrypted assembly, but it should
complicate thing significantly, assuming that you have a secure key
system in place to encrypt/decrypt the assemblies.

In the future, you could always rely on NGSCB/Paladium, and decrypt the
assembly into protected memory, which would prevent a debugger from
viewing the assembly.

Alternatively, you can always write your normal libraries and use
P/Invoke to wrap them for use in .NET, using your standard copy
protection scheme for the unmanaged code.

However, the unfortunate truth is that even highly optimized unmanaged
C/C++ code is not enough to prevent copies or reverse engineering, *if*
someone is willing to spend enough time/resources on breaking things. 
The most you can hope for is to slow things down, hopefully enough to
dissuade the attacker.
