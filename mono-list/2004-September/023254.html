<PRE>Loren,

I'm always happy to see Mono.Posix get new functionality.  It's a fun 
little assembly...  Anyway, I have a few comments (merely from the point 
of view of a fellow Mono.Posix.Syscall hacker):

Most of the functions in Syscall are named after the equivalent library 
function.  I'd suggest changing your passwd function to &quot;getpwnam.&quot; 
Also, your function is accidentally private.

Stylistically, I'd also change the Account field of the Passwd structure 
to &quot;Name,&quot; which seems more natural to me.  (Also, HomeDirectory could 
just be &quot;Home.&quot;)  This is a picky point, I know...

I didn't know much about these functions before looking them up, but it 
appears there is a getpwuid function, which is the same as getpwnam 
function but looks up a user by uid.  It'd be great if you added that to 
Syscall also, since it would only take a few more lines of code.  You 
can reuse the same C function (like I did for stat and lstat).

Lastly, in your C implementation, rather than using getpwent_r and 
looping through the results for the right one, it'd be more concise to 
use getpwnam_r and getpwuid_r.  (Again, I had no idea these functions 
even existed until just a few minutes ago. :) )

Anywho, cool.

 &gt; I've been using Mono for some software I'm writing and I needed a way to
 &gt; get an entry from a UNIX password file.  I looked around
 &gt; Mono.Posix.Syscall but I didn't find what I was looking for.
 &gt;
 &gt; So I wrote some code to allow Mono.Posix.Syscall to call getpwent_r(3).
 &gt; See attached patches.
 &gt;
 &gt; My problem is now, I'm having issues trying to test it.  I patched 
the mcs
 &gt; and mono source, built it and installed it in /usr/local.  When trying to
 &gt; compile a simple program to use my new code, it told me it couldn't find
 &gt; it in Mono.Posix.Syscall.  I guess my default mono install is causing the
 &gt; confusion.
 &gt;
 &gt; Since I run Gentoo Linux, my next idea was to modify the Mono ebuild and
 &gt; have it add my patches.  I didn't get too far with that due to some other
 &gt; issues in the ebuild, which I won't get into here.
 &gt;
 &gt; Can I have two instances of mono installed?  (say in /usr and 
/usr/local?)
 &gt;  If so, did I miss something?  Or what is the recommended way to this?
