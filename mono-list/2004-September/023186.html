<PRE>Hi Mono Team,

I have a web application which uses the System.Resources.ResourceManager to
read string values from an resx file. 
I tried it on Win XP with IIS and it worked fine. Then I wanted to know if
this works also on Mono... So my first idea was to check the class status
page (see <A HREF="http://mono.ximian.com/class-status/1.0/class-status-System.html">http://mono.ximian.com/class-status/1.0/class-status-System.html</A> )

- but unfortunately I had some problems with this page:

First of all, I could not find the System.Resources namespace.....?!

Secondly, another time I was searching System.GUID, it was also missing on
this page.... Gonzalo was saying that it might be a bug... so, my question: 

Is there another link/page where I can find the Up-to-date class status? 
				OR
WHERE can I get true information about the class status?
				OR
Are this two namespaces just links missing on this page and do I have the
actual class status page? 
				OR
Is it a bug?!

I tried the web application which uses the ResourceManager, copied the whole
application on linux/apache/mod_mono but it did behave differently from IIS.
So I don't know if it is my error somewhere or if Mono has not yet
implemented the ResourceManger or, or, or ...

I tried also the other web application which uses System.GUID and that
worked great. So I know that System.GUID is implemented and working also on
Mono, even if I cannot find it on the class status page.

Anyway, I find that Mono is great and it will have a big future.
Just a little bit more up-to-date information would greatly be appreciated.
Because often I have no idea if things are already implemented in Mono...
because I cannot find them on the class status page...like this case with
System.GUID or System.Resources.ResourceManager.

Does anybody else having the same experiences?

Thanks a lot,
I'm very glad for any hint/info/advice :)
Barbara
