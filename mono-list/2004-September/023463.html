Hi,

&gt;<i> Mono 1.0 was shipped awhile ago, and I'm really excited
</I>&gt;<i> about that... but now the natural question is:
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i>   &quot;Is Mono ready to compete with MS .NET in real business?&quot;
</I>
Depends on the context. For winforms, no. 1.2 will have that and it
should rock.

&gt;<i> ... and one more question is
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i>   &quot;Will Novell provide support, documentation, etc.?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>   &quot;If yes, by when?&quot;
</I>
monodoc already has the documentation. As C# is already a standardised
language, whatever is in the ECMA standard or the MS documentation
should follow.

&gt;<i> Behind MS .NET there is a huge development team,
</I>&gt;<i> support, documentation, and continuity... and I
</I>&gt;<i> think Novell should offer the same, but till now
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see anything in that way.
</I>
There is with Mono. The big difference is that (I would guess) the
majority of those working on Mono aren't on the Novell payroll - it's
the biggest difference between Open and Closed source. Take OpenOffice,
there are well over 200 people actively working on it, yet only about 15
work for Sun!

TTFN
