<PRE>I am upgrading from about a .3 mono to the latest 1.0.2

Everything has gone well, i updated the httpd.conf to reflect new attributes with mod_mono,
and now when i start everything, 
I get the usual pause, on the first access, as it is compiling the login.aspx and login.aspx.cs
files, and then it offers the aspx file up to me as a file that my browser doesn't know what
to do with, because it never got &quot;handled&quot; and thus, is being delivered to the browser &quot;unhandled&quot;.
hat has me baffed, is that in my web.config i have a auth section that will forward all
accessed to the &quot;login.aspx&quot; file, if not auth'd yet,
so i can but in other aspx files, and sure enough, the back end is clearly working because I
can put in  <A HREF="http://........./crap.aspx">http://........./crap.aspx</A>  and it will deliver me  ........./login.aspx,

this is odd, becuase it appears everything is working, back in mod-mono-server, the mod_mono module,
its taking over the socket in /tmp/mod_mono_server,
its compiling aspx/aspx.cs files I target, YET
it gives me a unhandled page in the end (offered up to my browser).
This seems kinda odd to me, because if the apache is smart enough to know its a aspx
page and went ahead and had mono compile it (first time access since server started),
why would it not also know to deliver it to the browser?
I save the file it offers me, and its just the raw  aspx file, not handled.

I am sure I will kick myself when I find the answer, but I just can't figure it out.


my httpd.conf is set up like the main samples i have seen in docs and list-postings ..

if i try xsp on the same apps, it give me a 
&quot;Redirection limit for this URL exceeded. Unable to load the erquested page. This may be caused by cookies that are blocked.&quot; message in the browser.  

Now if i use the /usr/share/doc/xsp/test  apps, then it works

so that would imply that its the web.config file that is the issue (the same one i used in mono .3)
but why would anything in a web.config file have bearing on how apache handles the file ...
not to mention, shouldn't operation of the web.config be the same for .3 verse 1.0.2 ?

i think i will remove auth from web.config and see if that has any change in things.

 
Any thoughts,

</PRE>
