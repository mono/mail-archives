But the development environment *is* there as far as some people would
be concerned, vim has come with C# syntax highlighting and indenting
rules for a while now and quite frankly that is more than some people
need.  The development environment isn't the language. The language
(that is the compiler, the runtime environment and the libraries) is a
tool, just as the editor you might prepare the source code in is. 

I guess this divergence of viewpoints is an amusing consequence of the
strange nexus around mono - on the one hand those coming from the MS
side and used to the monolithic application and on the other those
coming from the more tools oriented approach that arises in the Unix
world.

</I>&gt;<i>

But probably by others than the core mono developers.  That's the funny
thing about open source projects - people tend to concentrate on the
things that they think are important. I generally find that if one
disagrees with those priorities then the best way to sort it out is by
supplying some code oneself.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mono 1.0 was shipped awhile ago, and I'm really excited
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about that... but now the natural question is:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   &quot;Is Mono ready to compete with MS .NET in real business?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Depends on the context. For winforms, no. 1.2 will have that and it
</I>&gt;<i> should rock.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ... and one more question is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   &quot;Will Novell provide support, documentation, etc.?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   &quot;If yes, by when?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> monodoc already has the documentation. As C# is already a standardised
</I>&gt;<i> language, whatever is in the ECMA standard or the MS documentation
</I>&gt;<i> should follow.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Behind MS .NET there is a huge development team,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support, documentation, and continuity... and I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think Novell should offer the same, but till now
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't see anything in that way.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is with Mono. The big difference is that (I would guess) the
</I>&gt;<i> majority of those working on Mono aren't on the Novell payroll - it's
</I>&gt;<i> the biggest difference between Open and Closed source. Take OpenOffice,
</I>&gt;<i> there are well over 200 people actively working on it, yet only about 15
</I>&gt;<i> work for Sun!
</I>&gt;<i>
