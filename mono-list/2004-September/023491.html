<PRE>Amen! To that. I love vim. I use it for all my coding needs; however, m$ 
people are going to have a hard time figuring out how to save their code.

</I>&gt;<i>(that is the compiler, the runtime environment and the libraries) is a
</I>&gt;<i>tool, just as the editor you might prepare the source code in is. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I guess this divergence of viewpoints is an amusing consequence of the

</I>&gt;<i>world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>That is already a great thing, so it's not a knock on Mono or peoples'
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>efforts, but there's still work to be done.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>But probably by others than the core mono developers.  That's the funny

</I>&gt;<i>things that they think are important. I generally find that if one

</I>&gt;<i>supplying some code oneself.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Mono 1.0 was shipped awhile ago, and I'm really excited
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>about that... but now the natural question is:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &quot;Is Mono ready to compete with MS .NET in real business?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Depends on the context. For winforms, no. 1.2 will have that and it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>should rock.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>... and one more question is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &quot;Will Novell provide support, documentation, etc.?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  &quot;If yes, by when?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>monodoc already has the documentation. As C# is already a standardised
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>language, whatever is in the ECMA standard or the MS documentation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>should follow.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Behind MS .NET there is a huge development team,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>support, documentation, and continuity... and I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>think Novell should offer the same, but till now
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>I don't see anything in that way.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>There is with Mono. The big difference is that (I would guess) the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>majority of those working on Mono aren't on the Novell payroll - it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the biggest difference between Open and Closed source. Take OpenOffice,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>there are well over 200 people actively working on it, yet only about 15
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>work for Sun!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
