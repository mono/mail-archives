<PRE>Hi,

  How about registering the mono runtime (mono) with the linux kernel
so that we don't have to write &quot;mono&quot; before executing any executable?

  Ok ok... this is not my idea. I was just reading through dotGNU
(after a looooong time) and found this:

  <A HREF="http://www.southern-storm.com.au/pnet_faq.html">http://www.southern-storm.com.au/pnet_faq.html</A>

  The topic is covered under item 3: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3. I have pasted the
contents below for completeness.



Happy Hacking,

3. Using the runtime engine
3.1. How do I run IL programs?
IL programs are executed using the &quot;ilrun program, as follows: 
ilrun hello.exe
The &quot;.exe&quot; extension is not required: you can rename the program to
&quot;hello&quot; if you wish.
If the IL program has command-line options, they can be supplied after
the name of the IL executable:

ilrun getenv.exe PATH

3.2. Can I avoid typing &quot;ilrun&quot;?
If your operating system uses the Linux kernel, and you have root
access, then you can avoid typing &quot;ilrun&quot; to execute programs from the
command-line.
You must first register &quot;ilrun&quot; with the Linux kernel, by executing
the following command as root:

ilrun --register

Then you can run programs as follows: 
  chmod +x hello.exe
  ./hello.exe
This will also work if you rename &quot;hello.exe&quot; to &quot;hello&quot;, and then
place it somewhere on your PATH.
To unregister &quot;ilrun&quot;, execute the following command as root: 

ilrun --unregister

Note: registration will only work with the Linux kernel (versions 2.2
and later), and when you are logged in as root.

If you prefer to start and stop services with &quot;init.d&quot;, you can use
the script &quot;pnet/doc/init.d-pnet&quot; from the source code. Copy it to
&quot;/etc/init.d/pnet&quot;. The script uses &quot;/usr/local/bin/ilrun&quot; to register
the engine, and it is designed for the RedHat distribution. Minor
modifications may be required for other install locations and
distributions.


3.3. I've registered &quot;ilrun&quot;, but it is running the wrong version. Why?
When you register &quot;ilrun&quot;, it attempts to construct the full path of
the engine to pass to the kernel. Normally it does this by searching
the PATH. You can specify an explicit pathname as follows:
ilrun --register /usr/local/bin/ilrun
