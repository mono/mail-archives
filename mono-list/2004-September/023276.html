The mono-preview package has been deprecated. Try refreshing your RC
daemon so that it will download the latest listing of packages from the
channel. Revision 2 (mono-foo-1.0.1-1.ximian.x.2.foo.rpm) is the latest
revision to the packages.

&gt;<i> Mono-complete is, I think, a new addition that apparently bundles all

</I>
mono-complete and mono-complete-devel are two packages that act as meta-
packages, for they depend on every other package in the channel.  

&gt;<i> Presumably, there isn't anything in either of these two packages that
</I>&gt;<i> isn't contained in the individual packages listed in the channel. So...I

</I>&gt;<i> mono-complete and mono-devel?  Right?
</I>
The easiest way to install mono would be to install mono-complete and
mono-complete-devel. Those two packages will pull down every other Mono
package in the channel. Please note that installing mono-complete will
*not* not install gtk-sharp and other libraries.

I have received a bug report from one of ours internal users that the
mono-ziplib package can be unaccessible from Red Carpet. This bug has
been reported to the Red Carpet team and they are actively looking into
it and trying to sort it out in the servers. In the mean time, if you do
run into this problem, please go to <A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/">http://www.go-mono.com/</A> and go to
the download page to get any missing dependencies that could not be
fulfilled by Red Carpet.

I'll report back to the list once I hear from the Red Carpet team.

Sorry for the inconvenience,
