This issue has escalated to the highest level in my company now. Loads 
of fun   :-)

I've been instructed to get a quote from Novell for consulting service 
to resolve this problem. However, my contacts at Novell UK seems to be 
having problems to sort this out.

I'd really appreciate it if someone from Mono team can help us with it. 
It should be as easy as giving a phone call to either Juliette (+44 
01344 725 322) or Marcus Naris (+44 01344 724 315).
Your assistance would be very much appreciated.



Many thanks,
