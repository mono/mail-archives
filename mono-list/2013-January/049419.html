<PRE>Daniel,

Thanks a lot for responding.  A while back I read the article by Jon Rista
which was referenced in your link from haacked.com.  it was quite
comprehensive and I may try to use some of his techniques to get this
working.  It's not quite as easy as using ApplicationSettingsBase, but it
would be better than having to use the old .NET 1.x configuration style. 
Thanks for posting some examples from your app.  It was helpful to take a
look at them.

Just an update...  I opened this app up in Visual Studio 2010 and made sure
that the app settings worked and they did.  There were a couple of things
that I had to tweak in my app.config file to get it to be read when I try to
use it in Mono.  The good news is that the file at least appears to be being
read.  The bad news, though, is that it is throwing the following exception
when I try to read a property from the app.config file:

Type 'System.Configuration.ClientSettingsSection, System, Version=4.0.0.0,
Culture= neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089' not found.
System.NotImplementedException: The requested feature is not implemented.

It appears that I can write user.config settings out to a file, but I don't
seem to be able to read them in.  Does anybody know if this is something
that has been fixed in the most recent version of Mono?  Has anybody else
seen this?  Am I stuck using the old .NET 1.x style of app settings?
