Yes, but only if you implement these handlers as documented
(using an own thread and UnixSignal.WaitAny).

You don't have to ensure anything, unless your unmanaged libraries
are already using signal handlers. As long as these handlers
don't call back into the managed world, you should be safe.

</I>
You can't (easily) detect where a signal is coming from. You should
assume that the kernel is smart enough in dispatching signals to your
process. E.g. it won't let a signal reach your process if the sender
doesn't have enough privileges etc.
