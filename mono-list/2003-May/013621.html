<PRE>Hey guys,

I've been around here for a few months now and have noticed an increased =
amount of work being done on GTK#. It seems to me as the best point to =
start into the &quot;everyday use of mono&quot; path. Just take a look at the gtk =
nunit that gonzalo got going.

Anyways I need to do a .Net application here at work, and it needs to =
have a small front end. Seems like a perfect opportunity to learn/use =
GTK#.

Now I already have SWF experience, but the other workers here do not, so =
I was hoping to get them to use GTK# first, that way they only learn one =
windowing toolkit that in time will help us write truely platform =
independant code.

My hope is to write the buslogic and lower layers on MS.Net, but right =
the presentation layer using gtk#. I then hope that down the line =
(6-months to a year) I can move the whole thing over to mono and tell my =
boss to dump his windows licensing program.=20

I have been working (at the same time) on a small project to assess the =
possability of moving all our systems over to linux, and having mono =
around (and fully functional) would really help that.

So I guess my questions are
1) Is it even possible to have gtk# gui on a ms.net runtime?
2) If so how advanced/stable is it?
3) Also is there a howto or should one of us start with a howto on using =
gtk# with the ms.runtime?

Opinions, objections are welcome.

JBA
