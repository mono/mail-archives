<PRE>Chris,

Ahh, so when it is embedded in the application, it goes to the target
deployment and starts up the services.  And then I guess it has code
embedded in the application to interface to it.  I stand corrected.  So
apart from these differnces and the 'connection throttling' and no
enterprise features, lack of a user interface, then its basically the same
Sql Server.  Also, I suspect it won't run on Windows Server, since it wasn't
mention as one of the target machines by Microsoft, not sure.  I assume MSDE
will serve a database accross a network then?

Anyway, thanks for clearing that up Chris.

It has nothing to do with being embedded in an application's exe. MSDE is a
stand-alone service. It has a self-installer you can use to bundle it with
your application, but it can also be used entirely stand alone, even from
remote network machines. What Microsoft means when it says embedded is that
the service is installed with the application, and that the user will use
the application as an interface to the local SQL server service (MSDE). MSDE
is SQL server with connection throttling and removal of enterprise features.

Yes, I installed it a ways back and played around with it briefly.  I have a
SQL Server stand-alone machine available, so I decided to stick with the
real thing, and use MSDE for special custom install situations.

If its a service why do you suppose MS keeps talking about accessing it thru
embedded applications?  Are there different versions?  What happens when you
embed it with an application in an .EXE (as advertised) and deploy it on a
target machine without MSDE.  Its supposed to come up running.  Does that
mean it starts services there?  I don't have all the answers.  I just know
what the product documentation says, and what I saw from my brief testing.

Have you ever installed or used it?

N:\&gt;net start
These Windows services are started:

   Application Management
   ...
   Message Queuing
   Message Queuing Triggers
   Messenger
   MSSQL$ARILD
   MSSQL$VSdotNET
   Network Connections
   ...

The command completed successfully.

Those two MSSQL$ services are both MSDE instances.
