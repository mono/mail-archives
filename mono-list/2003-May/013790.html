<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> 5. Will VB.NET/MC++ and other languages be supported?
</I>
VB is already supported via mbas. Okay, it is not quite there yet (IIRC,
late binding is still an issue), but otherwise, it works.

&gt;<i> 7. Will mono be more like .net-1.0 or .net-1.1 in terms of API compliance?
</I>&gt;<i> What about applications that rely on a particular version of the runtime?
</I>&gt;<i> Will it be user-selectable?
</I>
While I can't comment, I would imagine that it will be compliant with
whatever is available from the EMCA standard.

&gt;<i> 8. What about documentation? I know CLR docs are there for download, but
</I>&gt;<i> what about documentation for mono-specific features?
</I>
There is rather a nice book due out RSN called &quot;Developing on Linux with
C# and .NET: The Mono Project&quot; by Daniel Solin - this should answer lots
of things.

&gt;<i> 10. In general: do you think that Mono-1.0 will be production-ready? What
</I>&gt;<i> kind of support will Ximian offer for it? Will you support both Linux and
</I>&gt;<i> Windows?
</I>
That's answered on the FAQ at go-mono.com

TTFN
