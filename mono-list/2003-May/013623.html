<PRE>Hi,

I believe that GTK# includes some other libraries not directly related to
the windowing system.

Also, you should have a look at the SWT port that the guys at sharpdevelop
are doing. This is based on &quot;eclipse&quot;, and I believe it provides native look
anf feel to the application. The only &quot;problem&quot; is that this toolkit might
not be mature enough for your present needs.

So, anyone cares to comment on what the &quot;standard/preferred&quot; toolkit will
be? What features have any of the toolkits that make it superior and maybe
worth the wait until it has matured enough...?

Thanks,
Luis

&gt;<i> Personally, if I were going to try to do cross-platform work I wouldn't

</I>&gt;<i> wx.NET project, but IMHO I think #WT is the long-term way to go.

gonzalo got going.
&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anyways I need to do a .Net application here at work, and it needs to

windowing toolkit that in time will help us write truely platform
independant code.
&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My hope is to write the buslogic and lower layers on MS.Net, but right
</I>the presentation layer using gtk#. I then hope that down the line (6-months
to a year) I can move the whole thing over to mono and tell my boss to dump
his windows licensing program.
&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have been working (at the same time) on a small project to assess the
</I>possability of moving all our systems over to linux, and having mono around
(and fully functional) would really help that.
&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So I guess my questions are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) Is it even possible to have gtk# gui on a ms.net runtime?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) If so how advanced/stable is it?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) Also is there a howto or should one of us start with a howto on using
</I>gtk# with the ms.runtime?
