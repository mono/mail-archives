By &quot;program names&quot;, do you mean &quot;names of *.exe files&quot;,
or do you mean &quot;names referred to in program source code&quot;?
Actually both of these are problems, and neither is directly
addressed by strong names.

However, the second of these is not too bad.
Since all names in the .NET CLR are namespace-qualified,
name clashes in names referred to in program source code can only
occur if there is a clash between two namespace names.
Namespace name clashes are not as much of a problem as clashing DLL names,
because they only cause trouble if the two different clashing names are
both referred to from the same source file, which is a lot rarer than
referring to them both from the same program, or just having them both
installed in the PATH on the same system.
Also, if they occur, they can be worked around by splitting up
the offending source file, or by writing a wrapper around one of
the two namespaces whose names clash.

Names of *.exe files are a more difficult issue...
