<PRE>#WT sounds interesting, I will have a look at it.

With regards to web forms, I wouldn't imagine one would bind a widget
toolkit to a web form.

Instead I was thinking more along the lines of, reading an XML file that
defines the UI configuration in some generic sense.  If the application
is running on the web, then generate the appropriate UI using web
controls and wire the proper event handlers up.

This is what the article was describing at the original CodeProject link
I posted.

For something more advanced such as a graphics intensive program, or for
instance a game, it wouldn't make sense.  But for a data-entry intensive
business application which relies mostly on data entry forms and
datagrids, I think it makes sense.

Something I was thinking about is the feasibility of reading a Glade XML
GUI definition file and generating a web forms interface.  Obviously you
would only be able to support a subset of &quot;controls&quot; like the textbox,
dropdown, etc.  This would allow you to use one tool to build a UI once
and then reuse it to target ASP.NET.

Probbably the #WT library could be intressting for you. This is a Port 
of the SWT (Standard Widget Toolkit from the eclipse project written in 
java).
We do the port to eas the porting of SharpDevelop.

#WT (and SWT) use native widgets on each platform. On Windows, it does 
API calls to the windows dll's on Linux it uses native calls to GTK (or 
probbably QT, but QT isn't portet to #WT yet.

Webforms arent possible with this. And I'm note shure if there is any 
chance to do a binding to webforms. (Another question is, if there is a 
chance to create a libraray that display's web-frontends and gui 
frontands with the same code, web applications need to have other 
fundamentials than gui application I think.


for more information about #wt have a look at: www.sharpwt.net nad the 
sd-mono-port list @ ximian.
