First: the GTK part of #WT didn't need GTK#.
We ported the JAVA sources over to c#, and since JAVA calls the native 
GTK functions, we do so too.

the problem is that there is something wrong with the pkg-config file 
for the gthread package on Redhat and Mandrake.

I answerd this problem one time before in a e-mail so the following 
explanaition is only copy &amp; paste but shoud be suitable for you:

.................

the problem is that the pkg-config file for the gthread packgage has a error

you find the file in:
/usr/lib/pkgconfig/gthread-2.0.pc

at the bottom, you find these two lines:
---
Libs: -L${libdir} -lgthread-2.0 -pthread
Cflags: -pthread
---

you have to change them to:
---
Libs: -L${libdir} -lgthread-2.0 -lpthread
Cflags: -Lpthread
---

(diffrences are the 'l' in the first line and the 'L' in the second)

after saving the file you should be able to build it.
............


Hope this help

Dominik
