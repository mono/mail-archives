<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Also consider that the MS and Mono runtimes are being ported to 
</I>&gt;<i> resource-limited platforms (handhelds, etc.). SWT already runs on those 
</I>&gt;<i> platforms, most likely #WT can run there too. Gtk probably won't, and 
</I>&gt;<i> probably shouldn't. Maybe this matters to you, maybe not.
</I>
Gtk already works on those devices, in fact it can run on two modes:

	* Using an existing windowing system, like X or MicroWindows.

	* Using no windowing-system and assuming it has to control
	  the entire system (frame buffer port).

The frame buffer capabilities of Gtk are actually really nice.

&gt;<i> Basically, this is going to end up being one of a religious issue, just 
</I>&gt;<i> like the Gtk/Qt debate. You'll have to research the issue for yourself 
</I>&gt;<i> and make a decision based on what you are trying to do. I think the only 
</I>&gt;<i> thing that everyone will agree on is that System.Windows.Forms is right out.
</I>
The System.Windows.Forms team is making a tremendous amount of
progress, so I think it is still pretty much in the game.

Best wishes,
Miguel.
