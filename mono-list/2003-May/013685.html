By 'useful' I mean: what is enough for 80% of the users.
Another 19% of the uses can be satisfied with a directory hierarchy
like:

	$libdir/System/
	$libdir/System/1/System.dll
	$libdir/System/2/System.dll

Where 1 and 2 are the version numbers (there may be more levels for
the minor numbers and the cultures). This is enoguh to solve the
versioning issue and can be coded in half an hour once the design is
refined. MS doesn't implement this, because shared assemblies are
required to have a strong name. The strong name is useful for 1% of the
cases, but I think it doesn't fit the world of free software very well.
Strong names are based on the concept of having a secret key and that of
course doesn't match with source availability. And if you distribute the
private key, 99% of the reason for having a strong name becomes moot
and hence useless. So, take the GAC, remove the strong name from the
picture and you get pretty much what mono has today (barring the
versioned directory levels outlined above).
