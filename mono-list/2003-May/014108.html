<PRE>You don't embed MSDE in an application in an .EXE.  If someone at MS
wrote this, it's wrong.  MSDE has its own installer.  If you want to
distribute a desktop application that targets MSDE, you would either
instruct the user to install MSDE or have your application installer
kick off the MSDE installer at some point.

MSDE is a version of MS SQL Server that targets the desktop.  It is a
set of services.  When you install MSDE you get the same &quot;SQL Server
Service Manager&quot; icon in your system tray area just like you get with
SQL Server, which allows you to start and stop the SQL Server, SQL
Server Agent, and Distributed Transaction Coordinator services.

They are also working on a version of MS SQL Server for the Pocket PC.
Perhaps this is what they are referring to when they speak of &quot;embedded
applications.&quot;

In any event, when you are coding an application on .NET, you write your
code using the Sql provider.  Whether the application is deployed and
uses MS SQL Server or MSDE doesn't matter, they are one and the same
from that perspective.

You can run the osql command line tool to create a database, execute
queries against the database, etc.  You don't get the SQL Server
Enterprise Manager and associated tools.  You can also access SQLDMO
with MSDE.  Using SQLDMO you can replicate much of the functionality of
the Enterprise Manager.  You can generate CREATE TABLE scripts etc.

The best thing would be to just go and download it and install it
yourself again, if you need to 'prove' it to yourself :-)

Best Regards,

Joe Mozelesky

Yes, I installed it a ways back and played around with it briefly.  I
have a
SQL Server stand-alone machine available, so I decided to stick with the
real thing, and use MSDE for special custom install situations.

If its a service why do you suppose MS keeps talking about accessing it
thru
embedded applications?  Are there different versions?  What happens when
you
embed it with an application in an .EXE (as advertised) and deploy it on
a
target machine without MSDE.  Its supposed to come up running.  Does
that
mean it starts services there?  I don't have all the answers.  I just
know
what the product documentation says, and what I saw from my brief
testing.

Have you ever installed or used it?

N:\&gt;net start
These Windows services are started:

   Application Management
   ...
   Message Queuing
   Message Queuing Triggers
   Messenger
   MSSQL$ARILD
   MSSQL$VSdotNET
   Network Connections
   ...

The command completed successfully.

Those two MSSQL$ services are both MSDE instances.
