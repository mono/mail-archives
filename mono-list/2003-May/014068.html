I'm still getting this error on xp. As far as I know I have the latest 
download from ( <A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/download.html">http://www.go-mono.com/download.html</A> ). Is there a newer 
version somewhere else ?
A quick search shows that path ( c:/mono/mb/install/lib ) embedded into 
various exe's ie mono.exe, mint.exe etc.

The workaround is to create that path and drop all the files frpom lib 
into it. That works well enough but is obviously not optimal.

&gt;<i> I took the advice of the response post, and removed all the scripts from the $MONO_INSTALL_DIR/bin directory, leaving only the *.exe files there, but I'm still getting the same error message.
</I>given those pathes embedded in the exe files I'm pretty sure this is a 
red herring. I removed them anyway
