<PRE>Hi again!

&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - having best internationalisation possible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - having good accessiblilty
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - being widely ported
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - being free for GPL and non GPL software
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - having 1000s of applications already built with it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - having &gt; 5 years of maturing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I believe you are talking here about GTK, not GTK#. Maybe GTK has more
</I>than
&gt;<i> &gt; 5 years of maturing, but last I heard, GTK# was waiting for the final
</I>stable
&gt;<i> &gt; release of GTK so that a definitive API could be then decided. This
</I>doesn't
&gt;<i> &gt; look like GTK# interfaces are &quot;mature&quot; enough, or at least not for a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; production environmnet...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most of his points apply, except for the stability of the .NET API
</I>&gt;<i> layer.  Such stability can only be claimed by Windows.Forms, everything
</I>&gt;<i> else is in the very same state of flux (Qt#, Gtk#, SWT/#WT, wx.NET).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So much of your criticism of Gtk# is void.
</I>
Sorry if I didn't explain myself correctly. It wasn't my intention to
criticise GTK#, but to point out that most of the points listed, whilst
true, only really apply to GTK applications. Also, as you point out, only MS
SWF can be said to be stable enough, and so, maturity can not be said to be
a point in favour of GTK# over all the other toolkits as it was listed
above, even if the underlying toolkit is, and that was really what I wanted
to imply with my comments, not that the other toolkits were superior to
GTK#.

Luis
