You are missing two very important pro-SharpWT points here: native look and 
feel, as well as native widget performance. You don't get those with Gtk#.

Also, why can't it be used in GPL software? The license is CPL, and if I am 
linking from a GPL software to SharpWT, I can always except that library 
(we are doing that today in #develop with various libraries). Legally 
speaking this is fine. If you have religious problems with that, well...
