<PRE>Personally, if I were going to try to do cross-platform work I wouldn't 
use GTK#. I'm not sure if either is ready for production work yet, but I 
would check out #WT and wx.NET. Both libraries use the native widget set 
so they can match the look-and-feel of platform. I am working on the 
wx.NET project, but IMHO I think #WT is the long-term way to go.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyways I need to do a .Net application here at work, and it needs to have a small front end. Seems like a perfect opportunity to learn/use GTK#.

</I>&gt;<i> Now I already have SWF experience, but the other workers here do not, so I was hoping to get them to use GTK# first, that way they only learn one windowing toolkit that in time will help us write truely platform independant code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My hope is to write the buslogic and lower layers on MS.Net, but right the presentation layer using gtk#. I then hope that down the line (6-months to a year) I can move the whole thing over to mono and tell my boss to dump his windows licensing program. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have been working (at the same time) on a small project to assess the possability of moving all our systems over to linux, and having mono around (and fully functional) would really help that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I guess my questions are
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Is it even possible to have gtk# gui on a ms.net runtime?
</I>&gt;<i> 2) If so how advanced/stable is it?
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Also is there a howto or should one of us start with a howto on using gtk# with the ms.runtime?
