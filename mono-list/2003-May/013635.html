<PRE>Hi John,

You seem to have gotten more than you bargained for.  Let me try to
answer the questions you actually asked.  :)

</I>
Yes. That is how Gtk# was initially developed prior to mono self-hosting
on linux.  I also run some simple test apps on the ms runtime prior to
releasing each tarball.

&gt;<i> 2) If so how advanced/stable is it?
</I>
You noted some nice applications.  These and others are underway,
proving that it is advanced enough to write real applications.  That
said, the API has not been declared stable, so it *may* change under you
a little.  We will be trying to minimize any such changes, but they may
happen.

&gt;<i> 3) Also is there a howto or should one of us start with a howto on
</I>&gt;<i> using gtk# with the ms.runtime?
</I>
There isn't one to my knowledge, but that would be a great addition to
the Gtk# wiki.  You can reach it from the Gtk# homepage.

Mike
