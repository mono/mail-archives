<PRE>Hi and sorry if this is a simple question.

I have spent two days trying to setup mono to work with 
System.Windows.Forms without success

I'm following this recipe:
<A HREF="http://monoevo.sourceforge.net/mono/SWF.txt">http://monoevo.sourceforge.net/mono/SWF.txt</A>

And using the latest stable sources from mono, wine and gc

I will describe what happens when I follow SWF.txt steps:

1 and 2- Wine installs ok, no problem at all. BTW I run wine under user: 
wine and I'm able to open notepad, etc.
3- gc installs ok
4- ok

At this point I realized that to acomplish point 5 I've to compile and 
install mono. Ok, I did it
./configure --with-gc=no
make
and I got some errors regarding gc_typed.h and gc.h
(oh, yes: I tried ./configure --without-gc as well)

Finally I copied from ~/gc/include/gc.h and gc_typed.h to /usr/local/include

I guess the problem is here but didn't find a way to overcome the 
problem with gc.h

I also got a message about -lgc not found. I removed all references to 
-lgc in the makefiles and it finally compiled ok.

5- all paths were ok.

I typed make in that directory and got an error regarding it couldn't 
finr mono.pc
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH
make again and no problems. It compiled.

(I don't know if the make should be issued from the mcs root or from 
mcs/classes/System.Windows.Forms/System.Windows.Forms)

6- ok,

monowinehooks.so  and runwine  were copied to /usr/local/bin/mono

7- added ok the lines.

8- su - wine
wine monostub

and I got:
Could not stat /mnt/fd0 (No such file or directory), ignoring drive A:
Could not stat /cdrom (No such file or directory), ignoring drive D:
wine: cannot open builtin library for 'C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\monostub.exe': /usr/local/lib/wine/monostub.exe.so: undefined symbol: mono_domain_assembly_open

I have tried installing mono via rpm with no success.

I compiled everything in a recently installed machine (no mono from rpm nor nothing) and no success.


I really don't know what's happening. And I'm interested in trying to run a simple app compiled in .NET windows.
