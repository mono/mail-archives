<PRE>I'm having another go at porting my latest game code to Mono. I have 
found that the .NET principal of &quot;xcopy deploy&quot; doesn't work when your 
project includes unmanaged libraries. P/Invoke doesn't find the 
libraries when they are installed in the same directory as the assembly. 
  I am working around it for now by setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the 
application directory, but this really isn't acceptable in the long 
term. Is this a bug that should be reported, or a design decision that I 
should work around?

Thanks, and keep up the great work!
