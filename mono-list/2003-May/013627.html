<PRE>Gtk# requires a separate install for the Gtk libraries, at least on 
Windows. Unless you want to package the DLLs with your application, but 
it's overhead either way. #WT is (or should be, anyway) a self-contained 
assembly. And since it uses only native libraries, it is more lightweight.

Also consider that the MS and Mono runtimes are being ported to 
resource-limited platforms (handhelds, etc.). SWT already runs on those 
platforms, most likely #WT can run there too. Gtk probably won't, and 
probably shouldn't. Maybe this matters to you, maybe not.

Gtk is very good at what it was intended for: providing a look-and-feel 
for a platform that didn't really have one at the time. #WT uses Gtk on 
Linux. But it can also use Qt.

Basically, this is going to end up being one of a religious issue, just 
like the Gtk/Qt debate. You'll have to research the issue for yourself 
and make a decision based on what you are trying to do. I think the only 
thing that everyone will agree on is that System.Windows.Forms is right out.
