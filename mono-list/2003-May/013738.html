<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Lupus, the problem is not with the design of Mercury, but with mono's lack
</I>&gt;<i> of intelligent name collision resolution. There is no reason whatsoever
</I>&gt;<i> that strong names and a GAC should not be implemented. You seem to be
</I>&gt;<i> pursuing this primarily out of anti-Microsoft sentiments.
</I>
As it has been said elsewhere: a GAC and strong names will be
implemented before 1.0 ships.  In due time.  

Right now we have other priorities.  If you feel an urge to get the GAC
implemented before we get around to it, feel free to contribute the
code.

Dick, Dietmar, Gonzalo, Martin and Paolo are all assigned to work on
other Mono components right now, none of them related to the GAC.  

Now, you can write another 80-line e-mail and waste more developer time,
or you can go and write the code, write Gtk# documentation, contribute
bug fixes, contribute bug reports.  All of those activities would free
some programmer time that will be used directly towards reducing the
time to be feature complete.

Miguel
