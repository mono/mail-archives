<PRE>Jonathan raises some good points. Does Mono have a .config file for 
system settings? Perhaps we could have an ordered list of GUI 
implementations, which an advanced user could change. The package 
builders could provide a list for the target platform (for example, the 
RH RPMS could specify Gtk, then Qt, then Wine perhaps, the Windows 
installer would just use a Win32 implementation). That would be more 
foolproof I think, since it allows for a fallback behavior in case the 
preferred toolkit isn't available, and it would not require any changes 
to the current build system.

Also, we should probably throw a NotImplementedException if no 
implementation is available for the current system.
