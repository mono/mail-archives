</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Oh really thanks!
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;What're the motivations that conduced you to implement a provider in
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;pure C#?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The main motivation was to work with a type of programming I like most: 
</I>&gt;<i> middleware software (I mean, any software piece which is not directly 
</I>&gt;<i> related to user application but in its infrastructure) and the 
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity to implement a protocol.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, there is the dependency issues. IMHO, with the 100% managed 
</I>&gt;<i> provider you don't have to worry about .so/.dll files. I mean, I looked 
</I>&gt;<i> at Java model, and I think the model 4 drivers are much more flexible 
</I>&gt;<i> and so, I tooked the same approach when developing Npgsql.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;Isn't it more difficult to mantain than the wrapper over
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;libmysqlclient.so?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that at first it could be more difficult. As you have to do all 
</I>&gt;<i> the work which already exists in the .so/.dll. But once you did the base 
</I>&gt;<i> code, things start to become less harder.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; Is the right man power allocated for this project?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think so. At gborg we have already some good guys helping and here at 
</I>&gt;<i> Mono we got more good guys too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; What kind of maturity has MySQLNEt reached?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Npgsql will be short in the 0.5 version (I wil be doing a new release 
</I>&gt;<i> soon). It already supports a lot of expected functionality and support 
</I>&gt;<i> for most common datatypes (bool, int2, int4, int8, timestamp, text and 
</I>&gt;<i> numeric). It allows you to work with datasets, the dataadapter allows 
</I>&gt;<i> you to select, insert, update and delete data. you have transaction 
</I>&gt;<i> support and md5 authentication. There are many bugs yet, and many 
</I>&gt;<i> features missing as connection pool, support for user data types, but I 
</I>&gt;<i> hope we can get it working soon. :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In another mail Marco asks:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;But what I wanna know is: is it really faster than the wrapper?
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;And if yes, does the gap between them justifie the effort of mantaining
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;a native provider?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't do this comparison. But at long time, I think it could be as 
</I>&gt;<i> fast as or faster, as we would not use managed&lt;-&gt;native code calls and 
</I>&gt;<i> the jit would allow us to get a performance close to native code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for attention, and please let me know if I said anything wrong.
</I>
Well, I don't see anything wrong in what you said.
In the next week i'll start to test your stuff.
Many thanks to you.
