<PRE>I thought that the GAC could also deal with version clashing. UNIX =
systems have the handy libsomething.so -&gt; libsomething.1.2.1.so symbolic =
link method to deal with it. There is no such thing in the Windows =
world, hence the DLL hell which frequently occurs on those systems.

Like you mentioned in other e-mails name clashing can be partially =
resolved with renaming a file or educating developers. Which, like was =
said in another thread, will not work for corporate developers or when =
somebody ports and already existing project.

How is MONOPATH handling the versioning issue?

I may have not expressed myself clearly. There are two uses for strong
names, as I see it:
1) handle name clashes
2) enforcing some protection on how some assemblies are used (this needs
help from the CLR and is only meaningful for proprietary sw in a closed
environment, IMHO)

I gave a 99% relevance to point 1, because I don't find case 2 very
interesting. You assign it a 50% importance, I guess that's fine,
depends what other reasons you see for strong names, I might miss some.
So, we're back at the name clashes: how big is the problem?
I maintain that it's relevant in a tiny 1 percent of the cases, from
the number of name clashes that I saw happening, for example, with the
programs packaged for Debian. The clashes are rare, hence my 1% figure
(that refers to the 100% of use cases for shared assemblies, not strong
names) though I agree they are still an issue.
