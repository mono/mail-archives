<PRE>I'm not on the Mono list, but Fergus cc'd me on this. =20

ILX discriminated unions should certainly allow the subsequent elements
to be named: it's one of the things I haven't got around to doing
properly yet.  F# will one day also allow them to be optionally named -
you need this if only to get a truly decent quality set of accessors to
the datatype from other .NET languages.

BTW if you're interested in using F# on Mono and/or SSCLI then please
drop me an email.  I'll put together a binary release of the compiler at
some point suitable for use on these platforms, and a source release
will make its way out at some point too.

Cheers &amp; thanks,
Don

Right.

I agree that fields of discriminated union alternatives should be
namable;
many languages which support discriminated unions, including Mercury,
Haskell, and Ada, allow or even require them to be named.

&gt;<i> or OCaml polymorphic=20

That's true, but how many other languages have OCaml-style polymorphic
variants?

Ordinary discriminated unions are present in a very large number of
languages, so the benefits for language interoperability of including
them in the underlying runtime are much higher.  Also, I suspect that
there is more scope for optimizing the representation of ordinary
discriminated unions.
