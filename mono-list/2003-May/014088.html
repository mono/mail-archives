<PRE>Hello All.

Hello Philip. I appreciate  your feeback on my efforts. Thanks a lot.

It is nice to hear , that you have been able to run SWF using the shared
libraries.


&gt;<i> ... You must read the file  wine-shared-20030519/wine/README.
</I>
   You are absolutely corect. README file is the source of more detail
instructions.
   Meantime if you run &quot;make&quot; or &quot;make all&quot; you will get Wine AND shared
libs.


 &gt; 3) I had to make a symlink from libwinnt.dll.so to libntdll.dll.so.

   The matter is that at the wine installation the link is installing of
libntdll.dll.so on ntdll.dll.so
   (libntdll.dll.so -&gt; wine/ntdll.dll.so)  for WINE PURPOSES.
    Therefore you should not make link libwinnt.dll.so -&gt; libntdll.dll.so -
this will cause
    errors , because libntdll.dll.so is belonging to Wine only
    (I wondered why have you been able to run GUI application in this case,
because
    this may cause the crash).
    Actually this is my fault - I have not informed Miguel about the new
name of this
    library. NOW I gonna inform all of you - when you will link  the shared
libraries,
    be aware, that libntdll.dll.so  is not the case now. instead of this you
should
    use libwinnt.dll.so .

&gt;<i> Don't worry about your wine-installation .. the fine guys at openlinksw
</I>&gt;<i> have renamed the files.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
 Actually I have been  concerned about the probable conflicts between
Wine and win32api  shared libraries. I hope I solved this problem
and tested both of them on probable  interference. I did not find any.

I apprecite your feedback again.

I will apprecite   any feedback from anybody :-)

Regards, Vlad Kaluzhny.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi there,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After a lot of trying and trying .. I got the System.Windows.Forms using
</I>&gt;<i> libWine working.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now that it works .. you can find the prove that a newbie Mono developer
</I>&gt;<i> can get these wine patches working (after trying for an hour or two)
</I>&gt;<i> here : <A HREF="http://www.freax.be/MyFirstSWFOnMono.png">http://www.freax.be/MyFirstSWFOnMono.png</A>  ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> tadaaa!!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that my test.cs-file was created using VS.NET (2003). It is a
</I>&gt;<i> standard Windows Forms application with no extra components added.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I compiled it with something like ..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> mcs test.cs /r:System.Windows.Forms.dll /r:System.Drawing.dll
</I>&gt;<i> /r:System.Data.dll
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some other problems that I ran into :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) You must read the file wine-shared-20030519/wine/README, not just the
</I>&gt;<i> instructions on the website ! Those online instructions will install a
</I>&gt;<i> wine-binary. This is 'not' what you need in order to get
</I>&gt;<i> System.Windows.Forms working. (Thanks to Miguel who explained this to me
</I>&gt;<i> on IRC, hehe -I should read before doing things, I know-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) It does not hurt if you did installed it the wrong way first (except
</I>&gt;<i> that now your current wine installation has been overwritten, hehe
</I>&gt;<i> -great, my KaZaaLite does not work anymore-). But then make sure that
</I>&gt;<i> you distclean/clean the patched wine source before recompiling using
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;make wine-shared&quot;. Else the -DMONO wont be compiled in each library.
</I>&gt;<i> (it took me 45 minutes to figure out why it was not working and why
</I>&gt;<i> running &quot;mono test.exe&quot; was showing me the &quot;how to use&quot;-help of wine
</I>&gt;<i> after it initialized System.Windows.Forms. Well not cleaning that
</I>&gt;<i> sourcetree was the reason).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) I had to make a symlink from libwinnt.dll.so to libntdll.dll.so. For
</I>&gt;<i> some reason the build created libwinnt.dll.so in stead of
</I>&gt;<i> libntdll.dll.so which is the library that Mono will load once it
</I>&gt;<i> detected that System.Windows.Forms will be used.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ln -s /usr/lib/libwinnt.dll.so /usr/lib/libntdll.dll.so
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe that symlink is totally wrong .. well, here, it does work this
</I>&gt;<i> way...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) I also had to rebuild mono and mcs from scratch and from CVS. Yes
</I>&gt;<i> that means rebuilding your corlib.dll too. I guess most of you guys know
</I>&gt;<i> how to build mcs. If not try something like this :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Install mono (and mono-devel) from RPM or using apt-get
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * export CVSROOT=':pserver:<A HREF="mailto:anonymous@anoncvs.go-mono.com">anonymous@anoncvs.go-mono.com</A>:/mono' &amp;&amp; cvs
</I>&gt;<i> -z3 co mono mcs &amp;&amp; cd mcs &amp;&amp; make -f makefile.gnu ; cd ../mono &amp;&amp;
</I>&gt;<i> /autogen.sh --prefix=/usr &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install &amp;&amp; cd ../mcs &amp;&amp; cp
</I>&gt;<i> class/lib/corlib.dll /usr/lib ; make -f makefile.gnu &amp;&amp; make -f
</I>&gt;<i> makefile.gnu install prefix=/usr
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5) Back to the wine-sources: In stead of running &quot;./configure&quot; I had to
</I>&gt;<i> use &quot;./configure --prefix=/usr&quot; (which is also the prefix that I used to
</I>&gt;<i> install mono on my development desktop-computer). This way all
</I>&gt;<i> dll.so-files are installed in /usr/lib/ in stead of /usr/local/lib/.
</I>&gt;<i> Don't worry about your wine-installation .. the fine guys at openlinksw
</I>&gt;<i> have renamed the files.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 6) Run &quot;export SWF=1&quot; before starting an application (or put it in your
</I>&gt;<i> profile or startup-scripts)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Okay, have fun :)
