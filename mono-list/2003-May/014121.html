Is there no chance that the Wine project would accept these patches 
(modified to be more general-purpose, perhaps) into its own trunk?

Seems like being able to use Winelib in a 'pure library' mode is 
something that's generally useful, not just mono-specific. But that's 
just from an outsider's perspective, I don't know anything much about 
the technologies or techniques involved.
