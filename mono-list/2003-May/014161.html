<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> - My first question is: were can I find the document on mini that is
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned in the release notes???
</I>&gt;<i> I searched the Mono TAR files but I cannot find it. I don't know if it is
</I>&gt;<i> stored in CVS.
</I>&gt;<i> I have no experience with CVS , who can help me out here?
</I>
Its included in the source tarball:

	mono-0.24/mono/mini/mini-doc.txt

&gt;<i> - If I start a program I can use the option -O=all to enable all
</I>&gt;<i> optimizations.
</I>&gt;<i> Which optimizations are used when I do not use the -O option, what are the
</I>&gt;<i> default optimizations ???
</I>
The optimizations will likely change over time, but the ones that are
currently enabled for your build are in:

	mono/mono/mini/driver.c

Grep for &quot;opt = &quot;

&gt;<i> - I assume that the mono JIT compiles the code on a method basis (like MS
</I>&gt;<i> JIT).
</I>&gt;<i> Based on this assumption I measured the time for the first and second
</I>&gt;<i> invocation
</I>&gt;<i> of a very small method. The idea is that on the first invocation the JIT
</I>&gt;<i> comes into action
</I>&gt;<i> and as a result the time to execute the method is longer than for the second
</I>&gt;<i> invocation.
</I>&gt;<i> ( I executed this test on run-level 1 so that very few process are running)
</I>&gt;<i> On my machine (1333MHz) I measured an initial threshold of ~200us.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However if I use the -O=all option the difference in duration between the
</I>&gt;<i> first
</I>&gt;<i> and the second invocation is almost zero!!
</I>&gt;<i> So in other words there is no initial cost for the JIT.
</I>&gt;<i> Can anybody explain why this is???????????
</I>
The method might have been inlined, hence you did not have visibility
into its cost.

Miguel
