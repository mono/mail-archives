Well, I guess the mercury code either loads the module using a method
provided by your mercury implementation or it is linked in automatically
by the compiler. In boh cases the name of the file on disk shold not
matter much, right? Or does the mercury code do something like:
	some_loader_function (&quot;gc.dll&quot;)
If I remember correctly gc.dll was a module of the main mercury runtime
assembly and it was loaded through a type/method reference: I can't see
nothing in that process that requires the module to be named gc.dll, but
maybe I'm missing something.

program names as the names of the files that contain the executables
that the user runs from a shell. There is also the separate problem of
programs embedding the name of programs to run (especially when the
original program is written to work on a system that requires a special
extension for file names and has a case insensitive file system...:-).
