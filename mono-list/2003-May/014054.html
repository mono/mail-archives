<PRE>I have been looking into doing the same thing with UI/BLL interface as well.

There is a series of articles on CodeProject.com from 2002, but the author never completed the series as far as I can tell.  I can't grab the direct link right now, but take a look there.  His articles are not directly related to Gtk#, but they should give you some ideas.  

His scheme allowed you to create one UI definition, and generate both Web Forms and &quot;Windows Forms&quot; interfaces from that template/XML configuration file.

Thanks,

Joe Mozelesky
