<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> mono has enough 'stuff' that it's possible to write real-world, usable
</I>&gt;<i> programs.  As long as you stay inside the working stuff.  What isn't
</I>&gt;<i> real-world is telling me to research the source for every class I want to
</I>&gt;<i> use a priori (a huge task), which is only slightly worse than finding out
</I>&gt;<i> half way into coding that I can't do something the way I expected to be able
</I>&gt;<i> to.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> An important part of being able to use mono is the home page's &quot;List of
</I>&gt;<i> not-implemented classes&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However that is generated, yeah, it's probably really, really important to
</I>&gt;<i> tag the broken / unimplemented code so the list is right...
</I>
The class status should be used by developers that want to help: its a
quick way of getting a grasp on what is missing.

For other more detailed things, we track those problems in Bugzilla
(like thread abort/suspend it is a very well known issue, with many
ramifications in the GC and the runtime, and in this particular case,
the fix is being worked on, but has several layers of dependencies).

That is just an explanation of the situation.

If you want something robust you can depend on, you will have to wait for Mono 1.0

The most we can say is `it works for what we use it for, and when bugs
are filed, we get to them within our schedule'.

Miguel
