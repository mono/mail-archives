<PRE>Hi Tom;

and first off, thanks a bunch for your comments which did shed some light on
at least some of my questions...

[Deployment]
&gt;<i> To deploy a .NET web app one typically copies all the files over to
</I>&gt;<i> the web server.  You could put everything into a ZIP file and just
</I>&gt;<i> unzip on your application server.
</I>
This seems pretty straightforward. However is there also a notion of
&quot;undeploying&quot; things again? Simply removing the code from the application
server? If so, what happens to classes that are loaded and have instances
hanging around?

&gt;<i> Using one of the MVC frameworks, like MonoRail or ASP.NET MVC, is
</I>&gt;<i> probably your best bet (either one - they're both good IMHO).  There
</I>&gt;<i> are plenty of IoC frameworks for .NET - I've used (and like) both
</I>&gt;<i> Castle Windsor and StructureMap.  If you go the MonoRail route, odds
</I>&gt;<i> are you'll naturally fall into Castle Windsor.
</I>
Thanks a bunch for the pointers, I'll have a look at this. At the very least
after having a quick look, seems Castle Windsor indeed is providing quite
some &quot;familiar&quot; features... Talking about this, a more general question: Are
any code components / frameworks / ... out there targeting .NET likely to
run atop Mono out of the box, or does this depend upon the very library in
question?

[O/R mapping]
&gt;<i> Coming from the Java space, you're probably familiar with Hibernate,
</I>&gt;<i> so I would say you should check out NHibernate.
</I>
Indeed familiar as well. Has anyone sharing a Java background any
experiences in how this compares to &quot;Java Hibernate&quot; in terms of stability,
feature set and usability in &quot;production-ready&quot; projects?

Asides this, what about &quot;other&quot; Java EE related infrastructure components,
i.e. frameworks for creating, exposing as well as consuming (SOAP/REST
based) web services, asynchronous messaging etc.? Are there analogous
technologies in .NET / Mono?

TIA and all the best,
Kristian
