<PRE>
I'm almost sure Unity is made with Mono (and it was originally a Mac-only
product before they switched to C#, and I don't think they'd have switched
if Mono wasn't there, since otherwise that'd mean no longer supporting Mac).
Also, this is what a Unity developer posted yesterday on Miguel's blog:

&quot;The majority of C# work done at Unity Technologies are done with
MonoDevelop - and yes, we want it to be good enough to be the default editor
as well.&quot;

Hope that helps.

</I>&gt;<i> The project I was talking about isn't that complex or huge, although can
</I>&gt;<i> be a bit big, and based of my knowledge about Mono, I think it can fit
</I>&gt;<i> here (also based of my experience in .Net in general)... I'm also taking
</I>&gt;<i> it as a chance to learn something new ;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, you're right, I had a look at Unity, but correct me if I'm wrong,
</I>&gt;<i> isn't it of the kind that works-with-Mono, instead of built-with-Mono.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, I just don't know much about Unity, and skimming through their
</I>&gt;<i> website previously, didn't really help in that matter. Any reference will
</I>&gt;<i> be very much appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks again.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> colleagues are reluctant. I don't know how big the project you mentioned

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hello everyone,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This isn't a technical question or something, but I'm trying to convince
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the company I'm working with to use Mono for some project we are doing
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (Linux only project). I, myself, came from strong .Net background and I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> know what .Net is capable of, I mean in term of RAD and such, however,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> other people around me is kind of &quot;old-fashioned&quot;, and they just can't
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (or their minds are just not ready to) get that things are changing all
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the time, and what was the best yesterday, doesn't necessarily the best
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> today.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> .Net has proven itself over the years, but that was all about Microsoft
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> .Net and only under Windows platforms, and still when you say .Net, it's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> associated in people minds with Microsoft and Windows, of course because
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it is, as there are relatively few people who know about ECMA or ISO CLI
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and C#, but my point is that the trend is still &quot;on Linux, anything but
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> .Net&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, long story ;) I'm also new to Mono, and I want to dive into it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and see how much of .Net it is and how good in Linux development it is.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> For that, I started reading about it to used it; previously I just read
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> about it for curiosity, and I knew the project since the time it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> started.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Beside all the talk about the architecture, the plan, the roadmap ...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> etc., I'm also very much interested in finding strong references to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Mono, i.e. real-life application (enterprise or other), something that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> shows the strength of Mono and how mature it is. I had a look at
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mono-project.com/Software">http://mono-project.com/Software</A> which was a pretty interesting list,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with pretty good applications, however, with few exceptions, most of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> applications there are:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1. Unknown
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Just &quot;not-a-big-deal&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Works with Mono, in opposite to built with Mono
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 4. I can't find a reference to Mono in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Don't get me wrong guys, but when I'm trying to prove something, I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> should take what the builder of the application says, not what's written
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> on Mono website.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So, after such long speech, I want you people to help me in naming
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> real-life, well-known applications that are built with Mono and not just
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> work with it, or at least to help me find references to Mono role in:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1. Wikipedia
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2. VistaDB
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 3. The Sims 3
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Sorry again for the long speach ;) and thanks in advance,
