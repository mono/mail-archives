Hello,

I take it you had a look at Unity?
And any games made with Unity therefore rely on Mono, the last example I've
heard about being that lego Star Wars game
(<A HREF="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2009/May-16.html">http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2009/May-16.html</A>).

By the way, it's nice to push Mono in companies (I've done so too), but in
order to avoid taking risks and getting into unexpected situations, it may
be wise to first propose to try it with a little project, so you and your
colleagues can first get used to it, better understand its limitations, and
so on... Just to be on the safe side, especially if your colleagues are
reluctant. I don't know how big the project you mentioned is, though.

</I>&gt;<i> This isn't a technical question or something, but I'm trying to convince

</I>&gt;<i> time, and what was the best yesterday, doesn't necessarily the best today.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> .Net has proven itself over the years, but that was all about Microsoft
</I>&gt;<i> .Net and only under Windows platforms, and still when you say .Net, it's
</I>&gt;<i> associated in people minds with Microsoft and Windows, of course because
</I>&gt;<i> it is, as there are relatively few people who know about ECMA or ISO CLI
</I>&gt;<i> and C#, but my point is that the trend is still &quot;on Linux, anything but
</I>&gt;<i> .Net&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, long story ;) I'm also new to Mono, and I want to dive into it and
</I>&gt;<i> see how much of .Net it is and how good in Linux development it is. For
</I>&gt;<i> that, I started reading about it to used it; previously I just read about
</I>&gt;<i> it for curiosity, and I knew the project since the time it started.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Beside all the talk about the architecture, the plan, the roadmap ...
</I>&gt;<i> etc., I'm also very much interested in finding strong references to Mono,
</I>&gt;<i> i.e. real-life application (enterprise or other), something that shows the
</I>&gt;<i> strength of Mono and how mature it is. I had a look at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mono-project.com/Software">http://mono-project.com/Software</A> which was a pretty interesting list, with
</I>&gt;<i> pretty good applications, however, with few exceptions, most of the
</I>&gt;<i> applications there are:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Unknown
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Just &quot;not-a-big-deal&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Works with Mono, in opposite to built with Mono
</I>&gt;<i> 4. I can't find a reference to Mono in
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Don't get me wrong guys, but when I'm trying to prove something, I should
</I>&gt;<i> take what the builder of the application says, not what's written on Mono
</I>&gt;<i> website.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, after such long speech, I want you people to help me in naming
</I>&gt;<i> real-life, well-known applications that are built with Mono and not just
</I>&gt;<i> work with it, or at least to help me find references to Mono role in:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Wikipedia
</I>&gt;<i> 2. VistaDB
</I>&gt;<i> 3. The Sims 3
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry again for the long speach ;) and thanks in advance,
