<PRE>Thanks Charlie. It is good to know that it does not likely
to be much more tasks to do for upgrading. On the other hand
I was under the impression that those obsoleted ones lived in 2.5 -
the conversion work is likely needed more.


BTW for those who join the upgrading, Zoltan has a script
of easy lines that would do large parts of the work. (attached)

Before posting changes, please make sure that

- there is no tests lost in transition.
- no regression is brought.

Some addendum: since reviewing the changes may still become massive
(Miguel did not want to spend our resources too much, and it is
pretty much understandable) I might take a while to do it, or at
worst have to discard the effort (in case changes look too significant
to review history). Sorry if in such case. I hope it goes well.

Atsushi Eno
