&gt;&gt;<i> Hi, I want to realize a small gui application with mono, for windows 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and linux.
</I>
&gt;<i> There is no such tool.  It would be much better to simply write the 
</I>&gt;<i> app with GTK# and have users install gtk# if they haven't already.
</I>
Is there a good example of a reference application for GTK# that works
on both Windows and linux?

My thought is that GTK# will make an app that looks like a linux app
(even on Windows), and WinForms will make an app that looks like a
Windows app (even on linux).

All else being equal I'd probably prefer doing a WinForms app because I
am the most familiar with it and I do all my development initially on
Windows.

Someone also mentioned SWT. I understand that's the GUI toolkit used by
Eclipse. I am not a Java person but that is perhaps the first really
good cross-platform Java GUI toolkit. How would that compare to GTK# and
WinForms?

Eric
