&gt;<i> Hi Mads, 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Re the presenters: a bit of background on these guys would be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; great, so I can answer the question: Why should my coworkers 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; spend their time listening to this and that speaker. 
</I>
&gt;<i> To be fair to Jackson, we all wrote our own session descriptions.
</I>
Sorry if I appear unfair. I did not mean to. I used to be involved in arraning 
a major Danish linux event (Linuxforum), and I know the harsh realities of 
relying on voluntary work. However, I believe a solid presentation of the 
program for an event such as mono summit is key to &quot;lure&quot; attendants from 
outside semi-closed circles. This can happen, even for non-commercially 
supported events. Compare the program for the 1998 event (in Danish, but you 
get the impression) at <A HREF="http://linuxforum.dk/1998/">http://linuxforum.dk/1998/</A> with the program for 2007 
at <A HREF="http://www.linuxforum.dk/2007/program/friday/">http://www.linuxforum.dk/2007/program/friday/</A> (click one of the English 
links to get an impression of the presenter). (To be fair, the 2007 event do 
have a fair amount of sponsors).

My current position involves doing cross platform stuff in Mono and MS .NET. 
Even though I wanted to go to mono summit, personal matters have made this 
impossible to me. So, my boss have agreed to send someone else. At least two 
of these guys are not &quot;part of the open source/mono community&quot;. Establishing 
interest in Mono Summit is a whole lot easier, if I do not have to draw in 
external websites, etc.

&gt;<i> Given the somewhat specialized nature of the Mono Summit, I figured
</I>&gt;<i> eveyone knew me - and certainly NUnit - but I just made some 
</I>&gt;<i> changes reflecting your comments.
</I>
Of course, if the plan is to keep Mono Summit &quot;closed-circle&quot;/specialized, my 
points may be all moot. I believe I do know you, and you should be known to 
most. However, I personally do not know (or at least could not explain to 
others) who Marek Safar, Lluis Sanchez, Jim Purbrick, etc, is. I can not be 
the only one.

And, I am amazed that the program has no information, whatsoever, (besides 
dates/times) for the Keynote!

From rereading this post, I can see I still sound harsh. I do not have time 
(sorry) to &quot;sugarcoat&quot; it, but I am actually really pleased that mono summit 
is going to happen, that so many people contribute to it, by organizing, 
presenting, attending, etc. I am just a bit frustrated trying to &quot;sell&quot; this 
summit to my coworkers, which is related to my own, very frustrating, 
inability to be there. An improved program with some (a lot, really) more 
details about the presenter and subject would really help me out. And 
probably others too.

Regards &amp; and thanks for all the hard work all of you do.

Mads
