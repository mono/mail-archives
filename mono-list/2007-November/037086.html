I agree with the poster who said the overall environment (developer
skills, tools, library code, etc) may favor one over the other in a
particular situation. And that can be a significant overriding factor.
It is difficult to chose an alternate language if the environment is
already in place for one particular language.

On the performance issue, I think the many years of Java development has
clearly given it an edge, at least for now. But you should consider how
much Mono has improved in the past 3 years against how much Java has
improved in the past 3 years. Mono's rate of improvement is much higher
and if you extend that into the future, it's easy to see that Mono's
runtime performance may overtake Java in a couple years.

Performance is an important metric, but not the only important metric.

Eric
