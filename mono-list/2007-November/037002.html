This is _really_ interesting, I think we would definitely be interested in
helping out
arranging such a thing, especially if we could have it in beautiful Telemark
next year...? (Norway, Porsgrunn/Skien)

We could probably also help fund such a thing, either parts of it directly
ourselves or through some kind of &quot;joint venture&quot;...!
We've got a LOT of Open Source companies around here where we're
located. eZ Systems and Trolltech, plus MySQL is just a couple of hours
with ferry away... ;)

eZ Conference was held here a couple of months ago in fact, if you Google
for the images I think you'll get pretty impressed by the thing... :)

We could probably manage to at least come pretty close to that scale
for a Mono Summit in Skien at Ibsenhuset next year...?

We would _really_ love to host such an event :)))
