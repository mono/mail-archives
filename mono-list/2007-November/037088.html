Hi Francisco

&gt;<i> I installed Nemo and it seems very nice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I noticed one thing...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It index all my home files but it doesn't show them on month view not in
</I>&gt;<i> any other view.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I create a file with nemo running it apperas correctly but none of

</I>
What filetypes are your existing files? Nemo should show all the
normal file types: pdf, doc, txt, images, zip etc. Also note that you
can change what filetypes Nemo will index in ~/.nemo/configuration.xml
if you have special file types that you want included in Nemo.

On the first indexing run, Nemo should show you &quot;inserting:
&lt;FILENAME&gt;&quot; in the console whenever it insert a file into the
database. Does that appear for your files? You can force it to reindex
using the --reindex switch. You can check the database also, it's an
sqlite3 database stored in ~/.nemo/.

&gt;<i> Also, when doing searchs, I can see that it can make the search with
</I>&gt;<i> tracker, tracker returns results but nemo doesn't show them. Is this a
</I>&gt;<i> problem?
</I>
Since we in Nemo show all files within a given date range by default,
we have chosen to limit the types of files we show. Also to make it
easier finding the files you are looking for by removing all the cruft
you don't care about anyway :-) So that's why there might be search
results from tracker that will not show up.

Another reason is that the query interfaces for tracker atm. is
somewhat limited. Like we can't say what mime-types we are interested
in, so we need to fetch more results from tracker than we can show and
then filter those based on what is in our local database. Also we didn't
want to give the user results from tracker that was not available
using normal browsing since that would probably be rather odd.

&gt;<i> Is there any way I can make nemo show my existing files?
</I>
It should, so it's a bug that it doesn't :-)

&gt;<i> Thanks in advance.
</I>
Thanks for the feedback, we greatly appreciate it!
