Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; System.Windows.Forms is not complete.  Not remotely complete.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Actually, you're quite wrong there. In the development branch (and from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the last discussed on there), it was somewhere near 86% done.
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> There's &quot;complete&quot; meaning &quot;it works for me&quot;, and then there's
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;complete&quot; meaning &quot;it's being distributed so that mere mortals can use
</I>&gt;<i> it.&quot; =20
</I>
No. There is complete meaning it's complete and not complete meaning
that it's not complete. There are varying grades of incomplete ranging
from very to hardly.

&gt;<i> Needing to run svn HEAD does *not* fulfill the latter definition,
</I>&gt;<i> and the latter likely won't be reached until Mono 1.2 is complete.
</I>
I've not said that it won't be complete until the 1.2 release is made.

&gt;<i> Meaning ~Q2/2005, unless you're willing to run the development branch
</I>&gt;<i> (which many are, but by no means all).
</I>
In my opinion, the more running the development version, the better - it
means bugs are found quicker and more get to use MWF and mono becomes
far more usable.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; You're attempting to run the 2nd-generation System.Windows.Forms
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; implementation (Wine-based).  This has been discarded (it was too
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; complicated), and work is going on to implement a 3rd version.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It was not too complicated at all. The problem was winelib was in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; constant flux, so it was akin to hitting a moving target all of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time.
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> I think this would qualify as &quot;complicated.&quot; =20
</I>
Depends on how you qualify it. Unless you're using a machine gun (or an
automatic), you don't try to hit a fast moving vehicle as the chances of
hitting it are greatly reduced - it's the same here. Given the number of
developers active on SWF and the speed winelib changes, it is almost
like using a small cannon to hit a formula 1 car!

&gt;<i> As in &quot;it's too
</I>&gt;<i> complicated to easily reproduce this for mere mortals unless we ship our
</I>&gt;<i> own version of winelib.exe.so, which will generate lots of complaints
</I>&gt;<i> form users asking why they can't use their existing wine installation
</I>&gt;<i> (or Crossover Office).&quot;
</I>
Possibly. All that needs to be said is winelib for SWF is deader than a
skunk which was shot in the middle of summer, fell behind the shed, has
rotted quite a lot and finally slimed it's way back under the cabin. Any
problems you find with the precompiled versions of SWF will get the same
response - &quot;winelib has gone, you will need to get hold of the newest
tarball and compile it yourself&quot;

TTFN
