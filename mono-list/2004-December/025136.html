</I>OK people.  I got back to where I started (except I can't get hold of 
monodevelop because their site's down).  I just had to think, &quot;What 
would I do if I had this problem in Windows?&quot;  The answer is I'd search 
the Registry and file system to track down all the bits and delete 
them.  So a find on *mono* gave a lot of false hits, but showed me the 
files I needed to delete - so that's that.

Many thanks for all your help.  I've really learned a lot (and not only 
about my own limitations!).  I think I'll stick to stable builds and 
accept their shortcomings.

Sorry to have wasted so much time.  Might have given a few of you a good 
old laugh, mind :)

Blwyddyn newydd dda ichi i gyd - as we say around here (Happy New Year)

Cheers

Peter
