There's &quot;complete&quot; meaning &quot;it works for me&quot;, and then there's
&quot;complete&quot; meaning &quot;it's being distributed so that mere mortals can use
it.&quot;  Needing to run svn HEAD does *not* fulfill the latter definition,
and the latter likely won't be reached until Mono 1.2 is complete.

Meaning ~Q2/2005, unless you're willing to run the development branch
(which many are, but by no means all).

&gt;<i> &gt; You're attempting to run the 2nd-generation System.Windows.Forms

</I>&gt;<i> It was not too complicated at all. The problem was winelib was in

</I>
I think this would qualify as &quot;complicated.&quot;  As in &quot;it's too
complicated to easily reproduce this for mere mortals unless we ship our
own version of winelib.exe.so, which will generate lots of complaints
form users asking why they can't use their existing wine installation
(or Crossover Office).&quot;
