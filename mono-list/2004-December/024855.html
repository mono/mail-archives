I agree completely.  One must use the best tool for
the job.  I'm referring the the world in which we are
trying to match as closely as possible the
functionality of a system over which we have no
control (MS .NET C# and VB.Net compilers).  In this
case, it doesn't really make sense to discuss adding
features to our compilers that are not going to appear
in the MS compilers.  If our true goal is to support
cross-platform development, then IMHO the only
features we should have in our compiler that are not
in MS's compiler should be those features that allow
access to platform specific items - not new language
features that have nothing to do with platform
whatsoever.
