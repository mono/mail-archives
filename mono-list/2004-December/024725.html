Actually, MonoDevelop from SVN works perfectly fine with 1.1.2. There
are some (being resolved) issues with MonoDevelop and Mono 1.1.2.99
(running from SVN HEAD)

No released version of MonoDevelop supports the 1.1.x series, as that
series was *not* in existence when MonoDevelop 0.5.1 was released
originally (Although by the time the packages were made, it did, when
the tarball was pushed, it did not).

So, to recap:

MonoDevelop 0.5.1 works perfectly on Mono 1.0.x (stable mono)
MonoDevelop SVN works perfectly on Mono 1.0.x (stable) and Mono 1.1.x
(unstable)
MonoDevelop currently will not build against Mono from SVN trunk,
however I except that situation to be rectified within the next 24 hours
or so.

Also note that these supposed Mono.Posix 1.1.2 changes happened after
1.1.2, so it is highly unlikely that 1.1.2 has any issues with that API.
