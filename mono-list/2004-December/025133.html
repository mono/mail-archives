Hi Peter,

&gt;<i> I'm just getting more and more confused.  Is there a list somewhere
</I>of=20
&gt;<i> what I have to get rid of, and how I should get rid of it - because
</I>at=20
&gt;<i> the moment I've got some things installed from rpms and some from
</I>tarballs?

Type in the first red border box you come to. It contains the names of
every rpm which is installed. You need to get rid of all of them. Don't
worry so much about the stuff compiled from tarballs.

&gt;<i> Also is there a list of what I then need to install?  I've looked at
</I>the=20
&gt;<i> scripts on your site, but you say you are assuming a system that has=20
</I>&gt;<i> never seen any version of mono - and that is definitely not what I've=20
</I>&gt;<i> got.  Nor do I know how to clean it up.  Also there's stuff you
</I>mention=20
&gt;<i> on your site which is completely new to me.
</I>
Okay...

1. Get rid of *all* of the rpms installed for mono. Basically, it's the
list that I've provided on my website. I need to update it as I've not
included cairo and libpixman in the list.
2. Download the sources via svn
3. Compile the code up.

&gt;<i> By the way, YaST says there's no such package as winforms in the SuSE=20
</I>&gt;<i> distribution - which is where I did the original install from.  So
</I>the=20
&gt;<i> answer to your question must be, &quot;Yes&quot; - on the grounds that there
</I>never=20
&gt;<i> was such a package.
</I>
What I was getting at is that if you've removed the rpms (which included
cairo &amp; libpixman), then rpm -q will show nothing. As it showed
something, it was clear you'd not removed them which was why the cairo
problems were showing up.

&gt;<i> Thanks for all your help, by the way.  I do appreciate it.
</I>
No probs.

TTFN
