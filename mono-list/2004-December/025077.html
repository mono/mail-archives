I was just looking for runtime checking of contract violations, not
compile-time.

&gt;<i> Adding pre/post-condition assertions would just mean going into the parts

</I>
Well...this was actually my next step: adding support in mcs. However, I
don't really have the desire to maintain a fork of mcs, and I was hoping
to test the water to see if this is something that the mono folks would
be opposed to, since it's not strictly C#.

=46rom rom what I can tell, there appears to be no way to add the ability to
do DBC-like checking to C# programs without modifying the compiler
itself. A perl script could theoretically just convert attributes into
code, but contract inheritance quickly becomes a thorny issue.

So, is support for DBC something that anyone would be willing to see in
mcs? Is it even something the mcs folks would allow as a patch, or would
I need to maintain a separate fork of mcs (something I'm not really
willing to do)?
