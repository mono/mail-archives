&gt;<i> There is a work arround about this: 
</I> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.shudo.net/jit/perf/">http://www.shudo.net/jit/perf/</A>
  
 Yes. I have ported the Java version of Linpack
 benchmark to C#.The porting work was reasonably easy
 due to similarity between the two
 languages.

hi again,
I don't have many benchmarks experience in order to get the results ofthe Shudo's web interpreted, but in my opinion, for the results shownon this web, Mono (JIT) performs well enough while Mono (Interpreter)was not so well...in fact was the slowest, isn't it?.
Sorry for my ignorance but what's the difference between Mono JIT and Mono Interpreter??.

I don't have already any test case that could demostrate the issue thathas started that thread, in which I said C#-Mono is slower thanC#-.Net. The thing is that I must isolate where the time problem isexactly in my code and then try to make a, as simple as possible,sample test that could be then studied properly. 

I'll like to comment too one thing that I found strange. It is thatwhen I want to calculate execution times (in milliseconds) over Mono ina WinOS the results appeared as the next example:
WIN MONO profilePut: 409355 ms

Why the WinOS result had no decimal part and have it on LinuxOS?, for example:
LINUX MONO profilePut: 251915,130 ms

Any idea?

bye
