I think so.  I'm not sure what someone else might say,
but my problem with this is that every compiler would
have to know about every other compiler and there
would have to be some standard for how to shift around
from one compiler to the next and pass type / symbol
information and IL code around as well.

I don't think it's feasible, and I'm pretty sure it's
not even close to being supported by the standard.  I
doubt it's prohibited directly by the standard
(because, after all, you could argue that this
wouldn't be C#, but some variant of C# and so wouldn't
be bound by the standard at all), but I surely
wouldn't want to try to build the compiler for it.
