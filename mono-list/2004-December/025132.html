</I>Paul,

I'm just getting more and more confused.  Is there a list somewhere of 
what I have to get rid of, and how I should get rid of it - because at 
the moment I've got some things installed from rpms and some from tarballs?

Also is there a list of what I then need to install?  I've looked at the 
scripts on your site, but you say you are assuming a system that has 
never seen any version of mono - and that is definitely not what I've 
got.  Nor do I know how to clean it up.  Also there's stuff you mention 
on your site which is completely new to me.

By the way, YaST says there's no such package as winforms in the SuSE 
distribution - which is where I did the original install from.  So the 
answer to your question must be, &quot;Yes&quot; - on the grounds that there never 
was such a package.

Thanks for all your help, by the way.  I do appreciate it.


Peter
