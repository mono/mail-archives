The answer is: yes, we need to implement the support for it.

&gt;<i> There are two requirements/changes lupus mentioned:

</I>
It's not so much the issue of marshaling the thread object: this
belongs to point 2, IMHO.
The issue is to decide what application domain should be used 
when entering the new thread. This also means that the wrapper
method (the method that makes the transition from unmanaged to 
managed code) needs to be much more complex: it needs to do
a domain transition when entering and a domain restore when exiting
(if the domain was changed).

&gt;<i> 2.  Setup/initialize non-mono threads so that mono can use them.  This

It's not possible to get the stack info for a thread portably, unless
we started the thread. This is part of the problem.

&gt;<i> A better approach is what mono already requires -- all threads that used

</I>&gt;<i> non-mono threads don't call into mono, directly or indirectly, but this

</I>
We can make the wrapper automatically call mono_thread_attach(),
but that's just part of the issue.
