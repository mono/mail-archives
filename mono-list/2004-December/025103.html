This morning (being a little brighter than late last night) I did the 
obvious thing and tried to find winelib.exe.so anywhere on my hard 
disk.  It turns out that it's not there - so it's no surprise I get the 
error message I do (&quot;Could not load winelib.exe.so&quot;).  In fact I 
couldn't find anything conforming to the pattern *winelib*.

I checked in YaST and it says that wine is installed.  I also installed 
the wine-devel stuff, just in case, but a find still doesn't turn up 
this library, or any other library with &quot;wine&quot; in its name.

Am I missing something really obvious here?

Peter
