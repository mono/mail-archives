<PRE>hi there,

I'm a newbie on the mono subject, so I don't know much
about it as well as my english level is as good as my
grandmom's one. 
However, I've been developing an application on C#
(DotNet framework) and my intention is to make it
multi-platform, that is, able to being executed in Win
or Linux indifferently. 
This application, in a summarized way, just open some
files and parse the headers in order to get their file
type and some characteristics. That is, opening the
files...read through some tags and creating an stream
foreach file where the tag-values are written
depending of the type and the length of tag.
The problem comes when I tried to execute it over
Mono. The aplication test really gets slow down by
using mono. It was about 3 times slower than executing
the aplication by itself on WinOS.
Firstly I thought that the problem could come from
Linux ('cause I was proving the application on
Mono+Linux), but I tried Mono over Win and the problem

persists.
Is this normal?, I guess that it is not...so, I would
like to know if anyone 've got some yield problems
with Mono of this kind. 

So if anyone has any idea about what it could be I'll
be very pleased on having some clues of this lack of
processing velocity.

Thanks for advanced &amp; see ya,
Carmelo

I used to have an interest in writing viral code and
lost interest quickly when Win95 came out. Hell how
could any of us in the scene write a more invasive
program than Win95. It made us all obsolete.
