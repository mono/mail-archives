Hi,

&gt;<i> System.Windows.Forms is not complete.  Not remotely complete.
</I>
Actually, you're quite wrong there. In the development branch (and from
the last discussed on there), it was somewhere near 86% done.

&gt;<i> You're attempting to run the 2nd-generation System.Windows.Forms
</I>&gt;<i> implementation (Wine-based).  This has been discarded (it was too
</I>&gt;<i> complicated), and work is going on to implement a 3rd version.
</I>
It was not too complicated at all. The problem was winelib was in
constant flux, so it was akin to hitting a moving target all of the
time.

&gt;<i> In short, your code will compile, but it won't run.
</I>
A lot of my code does run thank you... And it uses SWF.

TTFN
