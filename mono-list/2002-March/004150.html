see: <A HREF="http://www.go-mono.org/class-status/System.Text.html,">http://www.go-mono.org/class-status/System.Text.html,</A> completion 99%

I put an entry to the class status page, saying that it is 99% complete. I
think that's enough, and if you look at the code you can see the
implementation.

&gt;<i> Anyway, as to the overriding of the Get(Byte|Char)s methods, using
</I>&gt;<i> internal calls to an iconv based converter seems a bit heavy when a
</I>&gt;<i> simple comparison to 0x7f in managed code is all that is needed.  Yeah,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, now that we've had the philosophical discussion, does anyone have
</I>&gt;<i> any comments on the code I posted.  If not, I'll commit it this weekend
</I>&gt;<i> with a test suite.
</I>
Feel free to commit if you are sure this optimization works. The nice thing
about the iconv code is that you do not need any knowledge about encodings
;-)
