<PRE>Hi all-

I've been keeping an eye on this project for a while and have finally gotten
the chance to start working with VS .NET, so I've started to gain some
familiarity with C#. I'm still by no means an expert, but I was hoping to start
work on implementing some mono classes. The System.XML.Serialization namespace
looks interesting, although there is a dependency on a bunch of currently
(according to the class status page) unfinished classes, such as
System.IO.Stream, and some System.XML classes. 

I'm curious, what are people doing in this case? Are you simply writing the
unit tests, and leaving things unimplemented/untested, or are you somehow
testing them with the Microsoft class library? (If there is an RTFM for this,
please point me to it, I have been all over the mono site and have not really
found anything)

Or is it better just to pick another set of classes to implement that are not
as dependency-intensive?

If there is a more pressing need as far as classes-to-implement go, I'm open to
suggestions..

Thanks,
John
