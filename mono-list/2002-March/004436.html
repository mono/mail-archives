</I>There are QtC bindings for Qt 2.3 in the KDE_2_2_BRANCH of the cvs. The lack 
of a free version of Qt 3 for Windows is a big problem. People regularly ask 
about it on the qt-interest list, but never get an answer. Porting the Qt 2.3 
bindings to Windows should only be about a days work, not difficult. But I 
personally don't have a Windows machine, so I wouldn't be able to do it.

&gt;<i> Re the Windows.Forms, I now realize after checking out the bindings and
</I>&gt;<i> how they are implimented I was a bit over-enthusiastic. I was just
</I>&gt;<i> excited that I no longer have to depend on Windows for my GUI C#
</I>&gt;<i> development. Nonetheless, I am definitly going to be keeping an eye on
</I>&gt;<i> QtCSharp's status.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; change to check it out yet), and you have not started to do so already,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I would be willing to start helping on a Windows.Forms layer for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; qtcsharp bindings.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Mono _is_ advanced enough to start testing qtcsharp.  I haven't built

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;About Windows.Forms, this is something that should be developed in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;coordination with Gtk#.  However, AFAIK Gtk# nor Qt-CSharp are ready for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this step.  I will be making some pretty drastic changes to the bindings
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; soon. Stuff like overloaded methods for Qt's default parameters and using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the c# string type instead of QString.  As far as Windows.Forms, it might
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be good to begin thinking about what the layer will look like and how to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; abstract the backend toolkit out.
