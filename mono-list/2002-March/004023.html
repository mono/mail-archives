<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Note that LCC is not &quot;open source software&quot; in the sense defined by

</I>&gt;<i>general,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without buying a separate license from Addison-Wesley.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Yes, we did notice that.  It is unfortunate as you point out.  The idea of 
</I>&gt;<i>this is just an exercise in writing a CIL back-end for LCC as a proof of 
</I>&gt;<i>concept.  And then you could also do neat
</I>&gt;<i>things with it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If that's all you're looking for, why not look into other open source
C compilers.

If you want a quick and dirty subset of C that has good embedded support
the Small C compiler is pretty good.
	<A HREF="http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/">http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/</A>
Admittedly, it's a C subset, but it's extremely well documented

Alternately, there's EiC:
	<A HREF="http://www.kd-dev.com/~eic/">http://www.kd-dev.com/~eic/</A>
It's described as &quot;The embeddable/extensible interactive, pointer-safe,
bytecode C interpreter/compiler.&quot;

I know, it's an interpreter, *however*, it may be possible to change the
bytecode so that it matches the CLR's. If that's possible, you'd get a
compiler and the framework for an interpreter for free. No work would be 
lost if a GCC implementation were made later.

&gt;<i>The long term solution would be to do this with gcc, but this is a
</I>&gt;<i>smaller, easier compiler to understand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
One more alternative, if you're not concerned about managed extensions,
you could also look at a translator of GCC assembly language for a
simple CPU architecture (e.g. 8086) to CIL. Or take the approach used
in:
	<A HREF="http://www.cminusminus.org/">http://www.cminusminus.org/</A>

I'm not sure if any of these are what you're looking for, but please
take a peek before doing any serious work.

Take care,
	Robert
