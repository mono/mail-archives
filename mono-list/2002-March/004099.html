<PRE>This is a patent by ms on &quot;Safe general purpose virtual machine computing
system &quot;
Could it be the patent concerning the core of .net?

United States Patent  6,151,618


Abstract
A safe general purpose virtual machine computing system having a general
purpose memory protection model that is hardware architecture and
programming language independent. The safe general purpose virtual machine
computing system is software based to facilitate operation on hardware
architectures that otherwise would prevent the exchange and successful
execution of mobile code programs from one computer system to another. The
safe general purpose virtual machine computing system also facilitates
generating Bytecode Reduced Instruction Set Computer (BRISC) compressed
mobile code that can be compiled or translated into executable code very
quickly in addition to being compact for transmission purposes, and that is
prevented from accessing unauthorized memory locations due to Software Fault
Isolation techniques implemented in the code.
