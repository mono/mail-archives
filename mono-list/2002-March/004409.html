<PRE>&gt;<i> Overall, I'd recommend not looking at the source code for a system
</I>&gt;<i> that you are trying to re-implement in open source.  On general
</I>&gt;<i> principles, that can only cause serious legal problems.  Often, the 
</I>&gt;<i> solutions open source developers come up with on their own are better
</I>&gt;<i> anyway, since by the time they implement the stuff, they already
</I>&gt;<i> know the complete, published API. 
</I>
And you always hear these stories of hackers that focus on particular
pieces of the code.  I still remember fondly when David Miller made
Linux on the SPARC perform better on lmbench than Solaris and SunOS did.

He would tune and profile things until he would make Linux significantly
better and faster than Solaris.  Or hackers like Ingo Molnar that just
pulled out these amazing hacks to improve the whole system as a whole.

Yes, the Linux kernel has a large community and is a well understood
code base, but I hope we can make Mono both an educational ground (I
started a few documents some weeks ago that you can get from CVS) as
well as a production engine that people want to hack on.

Miguel.
