<PRE>Thats great, I hadn't realised you were that far along. C# bindings for KDE3 
will be cool.

I just checked out the KDE CVS and your commit wasn't there yet, so I guess 
I'll wait for your savannah project to get up.

On a semi-related note, I am trying to build the gtk-sharp bindings on Linux, 
using my self-hosted mcs, and am having some difficulties. Namely, I get 3 or 
4 of these errors when I run a &quot;make linux&quot;

./StructBase.cs(51) error CS21: Type `System.Xml.XmlElement' does not have 
any indexers defined
./StructBase.cs(51) error CS154: indexer can not be used in this context, 
because it lacks a `get' accessor

In the readme it says that it is only possible to compile Gtk# on windows. Is 
this still the case? And if so, why is the &quot;make linux&quot; there? For future 
reference?

Thanks,

J

</I>&gt;<i> pretty screenshots posted there ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The bindings are complete in the sense that they compile and include around
</I>&gt;<i> 400 Qt classes, but they still need a lot of work before they are feature
</I>&gt;<i> complete.  Some of he remaining tasks are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  I am going to can QString in favor of c#'s built in 'string' format.
</I>&gt;<i> ditto for the QDate and QTime. Basically, follow the path of the java
</I>&gt;<i> bindings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  Need to implement overload methods for those Qt classes with default
</I>&gt;<i> parameters.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3.  I haven't got the multiple inheritence problem solved yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4.  I will have to address the problem of extending classes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5.  Flesh out the rest of the type mappings that i referred to in a prior
</I>&gt;<i> email.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 6.  Once all of the above these tasks are done, then I'll concentrate on
</I>&gt;<i> generating bindings for kde.  Hopefully, by the time kde3.1 comes out the
</I>&gt;<i> bindings will be finely polished.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you are itching to play around I can send you a tarball of the latest,

</I>&gt;<i> from kde and get a Mono framework up and running.  Let me know if you want
</I>&gt;<i> this.
</I>&gt;<i>
