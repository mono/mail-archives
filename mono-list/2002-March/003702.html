Well, TimeZone is a little bit problematic since it's a bit &quot;broken&quot;
on Windows. It looks like mscorlib.dll is using some Windows system
call to get the current timezone - and this call is ignoring the
current culture, it always returns the timezone name in the language
of your Windows installation.

Like most people, I got my Windows NT license together with my machine
- and since I'm living in Germany, it's the german language
version. If you're using the German OEM version, it doesn't help to
set the language to &quot;English/USA&quot; in the system control panel - some
strings are always in German.

No matter which culture I choose, the timezone string is always
&quot;Westeuropäische Normalzeit&quot; for me - even setting the time zone to
New York doesn't help, I get the german name of that time zone.

So IMO this test will always fail if you have a non-english Windows.
