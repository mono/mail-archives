Well, I got started on the exercise because the class-status page showed
the class having a lot of unimplemented methods.  The mscorlib overrides
all the methods that I've implemented.  

If it was working already, I don't know how anyone else would have known
that without a public test suite. Also, the previous implementation of
GetMaxByteCount didn't exactly inspire the image of a complete,
well-tested implementation.  I suppose I could have written the tests
before filling in the class, but it sure looked like a stubbed
implementation at first glance.

Anyway, as to the overriding of the Get(Byte|Char)s methods, using
internal calls to an iconv based converter seems a bit heavy when a
simple comparison to 0x7f in managed code is all that is needed.  Yeah,
this is an optimization of unprofiled code, but it was a trivial one.

So, now that we've had the philosophical discussion, does anyone have
any comments on the code I posted.  If not, I'll commit it this weekend
with a test suite.

Mike
