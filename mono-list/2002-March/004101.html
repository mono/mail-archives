<PRE>Hello Jason,

You are in luck, yesterday I submitted the initial commit of the Qt bindings 
to Richard Dale for inclusion into kde's cvs repository.  Mono's cvs wouldn't 
be such a good choice because the qt bindings are dependent upon the Qt C 
bindings...  These are located in kde's cvs so, that is the natural place for 
qtc# to end up.  However, kde's cvs is in a feature freeze state because of 
the upcoming kde3 release, so I've started a savannah.gnu.org project.  
Hopefully, the gnu people will approve the project shortly and I'll have the 
bindings plus some documentation and pretty screenshots posted there ;-)

The bindings are complete in the sense that they compile and include around 
400 Qt classes, but they still need a lot of work before they are feature 
complete.  Some of he remaining tasks are:

1.  I am going to can QString in favor of c#'s built in 'string' format. 
ditto for the QDate and QTime. Basically, follow the path of the java 
bindings.

2.  Need to implement overload methods for those Qt classes with default 
parameters.

3.  I haven't got the multiple inheritence problem solved yet.

4.  I will have to address the problem of extending classes.

5.  Flesh out the rest of the type mappings that i referred to in a prior 
email.

6.  Once all of the above these tasks are done, then I'll concentrate on 
generating bindings for kde.  Hopefully, by the time kde3.1 comes out the 
bindings will be finely polished.

If you are itching to play around I can send you a tarball of the latest, 
plus a screenshot, but remember you'll need to compile the Qt C bindings from 
kde and get a Mono framework up and running.  Let me know if you want this.

Cheers,

Adam
