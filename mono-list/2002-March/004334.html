Ok, seems to be a real problem. I found out, for running my tests it
hasn't been a good idea to include System.Char in corlib_res.dll. 
This gets the CLR into thinking, that a char[] is different from a
System.Char[]. Excluding it takes me further.

Another problem is, that some tests are simply depending on
configuration. I get errors because my currency setting is different.

Ok, after I've my *Calendar stuff running and my easter holiday is over,
I will try to built up an environment under Linux and look what I can
do.
