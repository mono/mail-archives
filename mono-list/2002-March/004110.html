Good point.

That is one reason for why a developer for a company or an 
open_source/free_software project should not read patents covering that 
exact type of technology. If they are not owned by the company (s)he is 
working for ;)

The problem with the companies I know about, is that it would cost us a 
minimum of $20,000 :)
