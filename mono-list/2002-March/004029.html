I have just commited your changes (slightly modified)

</I>&gt;<i> they get the native pointer on construction and don't have to rely on

</I>&gt;<i>

I already added the method_info field. Unfortunately the docs are wrong,
and the MS implementation sets method_info for all kinds of delegates
(not only for static methods). I am just working on that to make it
compatible to MS.

BTW: we also need multicast support in mint, and some test cases -
interested?
