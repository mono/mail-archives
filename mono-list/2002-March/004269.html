<PRE>Hello!

    In the GNOME world we created a mailing list called `gnome-hackers'
which was a mailing list that developers could use to communicate with
each other and discuss technical topics, it was a private mailing list,
where only people who had contributed to the code could be added to.

   This mailing list turned out to be very useful when discussing the
future direction by people who were actively contributing to the
effort.  This helps a lot, because it is a good forum  for technical
discussion with little or no noise.

   Currently Ximian has an internal mailing list called
`ximian-mono-list' which we use to organize the team at Ximian, but some
of the topics discussed there are of interest to other developers.  So I
plan on moving technical discussions to the mono-hackers lists, where
active contributors of Mono would be subscribed to.

   If you contribute to Mono, and would like to subscribe to the
mono-hackers list, please send a subscribe request to me (or
mono-hackers).  This is a mailing list only for contributors.

Miguel.
