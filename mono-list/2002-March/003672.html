&gt;<i> I went to friend who had Windows on his box. I got a .NET Beta CD .
</I>&gt;<i> Proceeded to install. I copy-pasted the EULA into a textfile. I was able
</I>&gt;<i> to see that the microsoft.com license and the shipped license are the
</I>&gt;<i> same. I am not speaking about VS.NET here. Also does the .NET 'non-beta'
</I>&gt;<i> come under the classification of commercial release ?
</I>
Visual Studio.NET, the product, is completely irrelevant here.  You cannot
simply take the license agreement for one product, and state that it applies
to another product.  Please &quot;get&quot; this point, since this is where you are
getting confused.

The only Microsoft product required for Mono development, is the *free* .NET
Framework SDK.  This SDK contains the full functionality required to compile
C# source into assemblies and subsequently execute them in the CLR
environment.

Here's a link to the download page for this product.
<A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/default.asp?url=/downloads/sample.asp?ur">http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/default.asp?url=/downloads/sample.asp?ur</A>
l=/msdn-files/027/000/976/msdncompositedoc.xml&amp;frame=true

I've attached the license agreement included with this package.  (for
reference: \Program Files\Microsoft.NET\FrameworkSDK\license.txt)  You will
notice that it is significantly different than the license you dug up from
the beta release of VS.NET.

Warren.
