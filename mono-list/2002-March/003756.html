</I>&gt;<i> home as a primary domain controller, and to host sendmail, majordomo, and
</I>&gt;<i> httpd.  Connected to it are two WinXP boxes, one of which hosts .NET and
</I>&gt;<i> VS.NET.  I have a cygwin environment on the XP box, if that's of any

Start here Jerry, if you need more help just send another mail to the list

Testing is always good ;)
Creating new classes is also good ;)
