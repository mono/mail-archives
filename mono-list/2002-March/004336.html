<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> Microsoft is &quot;the evil Empire&quot;!  ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Believing this will get you nowhere fast. Believing some group or
</I>&gt;<i> company to be &quot;evil&quot; limits your ability to accept what they've done. In
</I>&gt;<i> fact, by subscribing to this theory, you're contradicting yourself by
</I>&gt;<i> using Mono at all -- since, really, it _is_ a (port of a) creation of
</I>&gt;<i> this _Evil Empire_, no?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is not about Sun vs Microsoft. This is not about Microsoft. . This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is about not need to own the latest windows, or window att all. Isn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that what mono is all about, when they want mono to run on linux?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed. But if this is so, why the line about the &quot;Evil Empire&quot; above,
</I>&gt;<i> even if it is in jest?
</I>
If you look at my first posting to this list, I don't mention MS as the 
&quot;Evil Empire&quot; or even making such a suggestion. I don't say any thing 
bad about MS. It was one who replied to my posting who used the words: 
&quot;...I don't understand why people consider Sun some kind of benevolent 
dictator and Microsoft the Evil Empire (tm). &quot;

So me suggesting Java VM as another way to get NET up an running on 
other platforms, make me a MS hater?

What I tried to say in my following posting, is that this is not about 
Sun or MS, its about running NET on other platforms! This is the whole 
idea of mono!


&gt;&gt;<i> It is very hard to discuss this with some people, because all they can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or &quot;want to know&quot; is Windows. They have invested maybe 1000-10.000  of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hours on learning to do window programming, then it is very hard to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> start looking outside windows. But there is a beautyful world outside
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MS, full of wonderful OS'es.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Java is a billion dollar industry. You have Application Servers, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> costing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 10.000 of dollars, running hardware costing 100.000 dollars. So Java is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not &quot;the next greatest after NET&quot;. NET is still a baby compared to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Java.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Just because it dos not come from MS, dos not mean that it is bad!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The same &quot;all they want to know is Windows&quot;, with your Java. Why limit
</I>&gt;<i> yourself to just Java? Further, as has been stated previously and will
</I>&gt;<i> be stated in the future, the _entire purpose_ of Mono -- aye, .NET as a
</I>&gt;<i> whole -- is to create a language independent development platform that
</I>&gt;<i> produces platform independent binaries. It really is the next generation
</I>&gt;<i> of computing. Limiting yourself to one language seriously hinders this
</I>&gt;<i> advancement.
</I>
Well if I thought that Java was the &quot;only&quot; language, then why do I show 
interest i C# and NET, by subscribing to this list?

The strength of Java, has been that I can use Java apps on win, linux, 
mac os x without doing any recompiling, or modifications.


&gt;&gt;<i> So this should not be a discussion on &quot;who is best&quot;, but how to make 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> NET
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> run on other platforms, and I think &quot;with my limited knowledge of NET&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that Java would be a good place to start the discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So why are you basically saying &quot;Java is the best for .NET&quot;? If you
</I>&gt;<i> really are out for the best for .NET, you won't want to immediately
</I>&gt;<i> limit it to one language -- and thus immediately limit it's abilities to
</I>&gt;<i> that one language. Rather, you'll want to maintain the language
</I>&gt;<i> independent framework with which .NET was designed.
</I>
Forget Java! Let me try this again. You do your programming in C#. But 
runs it on a Java VM! You don't need to know Java to do this. This of 
cause means that the NET classes is either written/converted to Java, or 
compiled direct to java byte code, and run on the VM.

I don't care if you use Java and the Java VM!!!!!!! All Im saying is 
that Java VM,s exists for a multitude of OS'es and platforms. So if you 
can get NET to run on to of a Java VM, then you are building on top of a 
well tested VM. And you are not limited to Sun! IBM and others is making 
there own VM's.

&gt;&gt;<i> I myself runs Win, Linux and Mac OS X. The win is only for games!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, so you run Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.
</I>
This is to illustrate, that not all uses Win as there main OS, and to 
illustrate that it would be nice to do NET on all of them!
