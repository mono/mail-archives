</I>Yes, it should be quite easy to port the QtC bindings to Windows. Just comment 
out any X11 specific methods that don't compile, and remove the QPrintDialog 
class which doesn't exist on Qt for Windows. But there's no Free edition of 
Qt 3 for Windows, only Qt 2.3.

&gt;<i> 2) If 1 is possible (or if mono 0.10 is advanced along enough so as to make
</I>&gt;<i> building test programs on linux possible, dunno haven't gotten a change to
</I>&gt;<i> check it out yet), and you have not started to do so already, I would be
</I>&gt;<i> willing to start helping on a Windows.Forms layer for the qtcsharp
</I>&gt;<i> bindings.
</I>Would it be possible to autogenerate the Windows.Forms layer? You could 
nominate a Qt peer class for each of the Windows.Forms controls. 

For instance, QComboBox would map onto a WinComboBox or whatever the 
Windows.Forms combo box control is called. Then would it be possible to map 
standard Window.Forms methods onto the Qt equivalents in a code generator? 
QComboBox.insertItem(String item, int index) must have an equivalent Windows 
method with a different name. So you could generate a 
'WinComboBox.myInsertMethod()' which would call QComboBox.insertItem(). 

Otherwise, it could be a lot of manual work and editing I would have thought.
