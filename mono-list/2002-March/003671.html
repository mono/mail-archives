Hi,
	Sorry to bother you alll...but you gotta read this....
&gt;<i> The .NET Framework SDK (and redistributables) comes with a different license
</I>&gt;<i> than Visual Studio.NET.  The quoted clause above does not appear in the .NET
</I>&gt;<i> Framework license.  Also, the .NET Framework was released in 'non-beta' form
</I>&gt;<i> about a month prior to Visual Studio.NET's release.
</I>	I went to friend who had Windows on his box. I got a .NET Beta CD .
Proceeded to install. I copy-pasted the EULA into a textfile. I was able
to see that the microsoft.com license and the shipped license are the 
same. I am not speaking about VS.NET here. Also does the .NET 'non-beta'
come under the classification of commercial release ?
&gt;<i> Besides, the ability (or lack of such) to publish benchmarks comparing Mono
</I>&gt;<i> to MS's .NET implementation certainly would not be a hindrance to the
</I>&gt;<i> development, testing, and use of Mono.
</I>	I think development/testing will not suffer. But it prevents you
from saying that &quot;Use Mono -- It's faster that MS CLR&quot; even if it is
true.

	This was just my $0.02 about the MS EULA. Please read attatched EULA.
