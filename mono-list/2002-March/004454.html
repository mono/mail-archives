<PRE>Guenther Roith:
&gt;<i> .net/windows: 20 sec.
</I>&gt;<i> mono/linux: 25sec.
</I>
First, I wouldn't draw any comparisons between different software on different
operating systems. Too many things changing at once. What were the results for
mono/windows?

However, I'm surprised by the difference, since they should be JITting to
equivalent or at least similar assembly. It might be interesting to see what
assembly they are generating. I think on .NET you can do this with the
debugger.

&gt;<i> mint/linux: I stopped it after it had wasted 8 minutes (is this possible??)
</I> 
Yes, entirely possible. mint is generating and executing millions of
instructions on its VM, each VM instruction will correspond to quite a few
assembly instructions.

&gt;<i> I know this thing says not to much as the class lib is not tested with this
</I>&gt;<i> and just countig is not a real situation.
</I>
Yeah, you wait until strings get involved. Then things get really slow. :(
