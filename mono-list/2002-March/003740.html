<PRE>Hi Fergus,

Could you define what the difference is between a full featured JIT
compiler (i.e. caching + optimizing + profiling) and Transmeta style
&quot;code morphing&quot;?  Is there much difference?  But maybe we should take
that offline (i.e. not on mono-list). :-)

&gt;<i> &gt; I also do not see the point -- one compiles (ie. JIT

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; language) anyways before running it anyways.  Thus the only benefit

&gt;<i> &gt; that one does not have to JIT code before running it.  But even this

</I>
Sorry, you are correct -- I am wrong.  .NET will only cache JIT'ed
binaries if you generate them using the ngen.exe tool.  Otherwise it
only uses the in memory cache.  I guess this strategy makes sense since
otherwise your hard drive could be quickly filled with rarely used
preJIT'ed assemblies.  Although it could be easily improved to watch
which what assemblies are used often and add those to the
global/personal assembly cache (i.e. GAC) while at the same time
removing rarely used assemblies.

The GAC is located usually at &quot;C:\WINNT\assembly&quot; or equivalent...

Cheers,
