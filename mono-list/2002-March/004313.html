<PRE>&gt;<i> I'm a little confused.  The website says that currently MCS only runs on
</I>&gt;<i> Windows.  However, there is a shell script which builds MCS and the other
</I>&gt;<i> compnents under Linux.  When I finished building it said I had to move the
</I>&gt;<i> class libraries into the lib directory.
</I>
MCS currently builds on both Windows and Linux (the web pages need to be
updated).  The only problem right now, is that my hard drive died last
night, and I had to reinstall a full system (linux, ximian, vmware, xp,
.net sdk) and I am basically paralized until this happens.

&gt;<i> Does the C# compiler work under Linux?  Where would I get the class
</I>&gt;<i> libraries?
</I>
Yes.  A set of binaries are on the nightly snapshots, but as every other
project, they are already outdated.  I will try to push something as
soon as my system is operational again.

If you have Windows + .NET you can compile those, or wait for me to
finish my installation. 

Miguel
