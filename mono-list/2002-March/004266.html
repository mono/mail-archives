<PRE>Hi.

&gt;<i> Well. First say I am the last guy in here, just a lurker willing to
</I>&gt;<i> start contributing like you in the very short future. And like you I am
</I>&gt;<i> not experienced in C# yet. Even if I were, there'a crowd of computer
</I>&gt;<i> gods in here so I think we shall prepare ourselves a lot in C# before
</I>&gt;<i> just dreaming on helping this guys and gals far from the other tasks I
</I>&gt;<i> said above. There is a lack of documentation. You might start working
</I>&gt;<i> there so you get in touch with the way people work here and with the
</I>&gt;<i> classes themselves. But only C# gurus can write new code I think. If you
</I>&gt;<i> want to make a try, oh well. We'd all love it. Commiting the bugs you
</I>
The BEST way to learn both C# and the APIs that you might be able to
contribute to is to write unit tests against Microsoft's classes. By writing
tests that pass for Microsoft, you'd be giving us a bunch of tests that we
need to make pass for Mono. This assumes, of course, that you have access to
a Windows box. If not, you can still write tests against Mono's code becuase
there (unfortunately) aren't nearly enough tests for all of it yet.

You don't have to be &quot;guru&quot; to write tests but by writing your tests first,
you'll become one.

Jason
