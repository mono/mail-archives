<PRE>|<i> So why has the corlib_res.dll been commented out?
</I>|<i>
</I>
I think I was the one who did that.  There are many places in the corlibs
now where icalls (internal calls) are made that require the mono runtime.
You simply cannot test unless you run the tests under either mono or mint.

I'm pretty sure mono does not build on windows right now, and I'm not sure
about mint but it probably does.

If you do try the unit tests on windows without mint or mono, it will spit
out about 300 errors and failures which new users would probably find
alarming. I do 'make test' now to generate the exe's and dll's to run on
Linux and to run the unit tests against MS's corlib to verify the tests
themselves.

I have been trying to get the unit tests working on Linux.  First, I am
trying to get Martin Baulig's RunTests.corlib.exe to work on both mono and
mint, and then I will move on to getting NUnitConsole running there.

I would love some help since I basically have learn how to debug C programs
on Linux in order to figure out what the problems are, and that takes some
time. Seems like I even have to learn x86 assembly now too :)

Another useful task would be to run the unit tests on Windows under mint and
see what happens.

Anyone have time and interest in any of this, please let me know.

Regards,
Nick D.
