<PRE>Hey Monkeys!
I just submitted the system.drawing.Color for addition to CVS.
As long as I am working on color stuff I plan to start work on the following
classes:
KnownColor
SystemColors
ColorTranslator
ColorConverter

A couple of questions:

I plan to just stub out the SystemColors class because they are runtime
colors such as WindowColor that need to be gotten from the OS. Since this
stuff runs on MAC/SUN/Linux, etc, I do not know how to handle those, and the
implementation may require other corlib classes not yet implemented. Any
ideas?

ColorConverter is called from the TypeDescriptor converter, not sure what
and how to do this, so I may do little to nothing on it. Any ideas?

KnownColor is just an enum of the named colors in the Color class. At least
for the first pass I plan to just cut and paste the code from Color to
KnownColor. Should I do this instead via reflection or inherited Interfaces?
It seems that since these should rarely if ever change, it would be best to
just duplicate the code and avoid the overhead of the other options. Any
ideas?


Also what is the opinion of using #regions in Mono code?
Thanks,
Dennis
