Is there any way to find out how much of this is spent in the lexer? MCS uses a
custom lexer, and in particular uses a hashtable lookup to recognize keywords.

String.GetHashCode() is computed in C# at the moment. It should definitely have
an icall (btw I'm not saying that icalls are the way to make things faster --
but it's such a fundamental operation). Also it is not cached, although strings
are supposed to be immutable, right? Perhaps change it to:

  public override int GetHashCode () {
          if (!is_hashed) {
                  // compute hash_code
                  is_hashed = true;
          }

          return hash_code;
  }

This may/may not make any difference. As ever, profiling's your best weapon :)

In general custom lexers are slower than machine generated ones. I did some
work a long time ago on porting a fast lexer generator to C# -- I could dig it
up if there's need for it.

Dan.
