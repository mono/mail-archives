<PRE>&gt;<i> Just a point here on the Microsoft API. While I really appreciate the rigor
</I>&gt;<i> with which they imposed the Pascal casing and naming conventions to the
</I>&gt;<i> methods, properties and class names, their argument names suck. I've seen a
</I>&gt;<i> mixture of UNIX style vryshrtargnms, Hungarian style lpArgumntNames,
</I>&gt;<i> verbosesamecasestyle, javaStyleCamelCaseArguments, and maybe even a few
</I>&gt;<i> underlines thrown in there for good measure. This is one point where I would
</I>&gt;<i> not like to follow the MS docs, and perhaps we could standardise on something
</I>&gt;<i> here (maybe camel or underline, please not hungarian ;), seeing as argument
</I>&gt;<i> names are meant to be somewhat descriptive.
</I>
Very good point, I had noticed this, but not paid enough attention.   

I do not care about going with camel or underline modes, either are
fine, I have seen a lot of camel style for the arguments, lets just use
this. 

&gt;<i> It saves 5 lines, but perhaps you feel it's just plain ugly :)
</I>
I swing back and forth with that particular style.  I think it makes
sense to have the &quot;short&quot; version of the properties as well.

Miguel.
