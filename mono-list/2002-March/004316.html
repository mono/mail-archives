Believing this will get you nowhere fast. Believing some group or
company to be &quot;evil&quot; limits your ability to accept what they've done. In
fact, by subscribing to this theory, you're contradicting yourself by
using Mono at all -- since, really, it _is_ a (port of a) creation of
this _Evil Empire_, no?

Agreed. But if this is so, why the line about the &quot;Evil Empire&quot; above,
even if it is in jest?

</I>
Agreed, except for the reasons stated below about why Java should not be
the sole .NET language.

</I>&gt;<i> Just because it dos not come from MS, dos not mean that it is bad!
</I>
The same &quot;all they want to know is Windows&quot;, with your Java. Why limit
yourself to just Java? Further, as has been stated previously and will
be stated in the future, the _entire purpose_ of Mono -- aye, .NET as a
whole -- is to create a language independent development platform that
produces platform independent binaries. It really is the next generation
of computing. Limiting yourself to one language seriously hinders this
advancement.

</I>&gt;<i> that Java would be a good place to start the discussion.
</I>
So why are you basically saying &quot;Java is the best for .NET&quot;? If you
really are out for the best for .NET, you won't want to immediately
limit it to one language -- and thus immediately limit it's abilities to
that one language. Rather, you'll want to maintain the language
independent framework with which .NET was designed.

&gt;<i> C++ is an option, but is is not as easy to port to other platforms as=20
</I>&gt;<i> Java.
</I>
I agree that Java can be easier to port than C++. However, C++ is older
than Java, and has thus been used for longer. But Java vs. C++ isn't the
issue. C# _is_ the issue. And again, as has been stated before and will
be stated again, the reasons .NET went with C# have been stated
previously and will be stated again. I know at least two of these. First
of which is the performance issue. The second of which is to actually
port .NET, and not modify it (.NET is done in C#, VB.NET, ASP.NET and J#
-- with which I'm not really familiar, but I surmise it's closer to Java
than even C#).=20

&gt;<i> I myself runs Win, Linux and Mac OS X. The win is only for games!
</I>
OK, so you run Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.=20

Chris Nehren
