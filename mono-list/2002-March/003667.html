It would be very, very nice to fit any new Mono code into 80 columns
whenever possible (79, actually, if you don't want to wrap in Emacs).

I use big fonts on a tiny laptop screen (so I don't go blind from
hacking too much), and much of the Mono code simply doesn't fit unless I
shrink my Emacs fonts down to microscopic sizes.

As Linus writes, in the kernel's CodingStyle:

  Now, some people will claim that having 8-character indentations makes
  the code move too far to the right, and makes it hard to read on a
  80-character terminal screen.  The answer to that is that if you need
  more than 3 levels of indentation, you're screwed anyway, and should
  fix your program. 

  In short, 8-char indents make things easier to read, and have the
  added benefit of warning you when you're nesting your functions too
  deep.  Heed that warning. 

This is a very good argument for using 8-space identation.

However, it is not such a good argument when you use anywhere from 5 to
14(!) consecutive tabs in a source file, or include the following 238
column line (which isn't actually the longest in Mono):

---
                                System.Diagnostics.Debug.Fail(&quot;System.Web.Cache.Dispose() Exception when closing cache entry&quot;, &quot;Message: &quot; + objException.Message + &quot; Stack: &quot; + objException.StackTrace + &quot; Source:&quot; + objException.Source);
---

If you're going to use huge indentation, you would make many of us happy
by keeping it to 4 or 5 levels, and sticking to 79 columns (or at least
the official 110 or so). ;-)

Cheers,
Eric
