<PRE>&gt;<i> Do the Ximian team or any other list members have access to some legal

I think you raise a good point.  I would avoid trying to look at those
patents to avoid getting any implementation ideas from there.

Virtual machines to execute secure code is not a new thing.  For
instance, Secure Tcl did this as early as 1992.  This seems to pre-date
Java, and I did not even have to research this, I just remember being on
the mailing list that discussed secure execution environments back in
that day.

Miguel.
