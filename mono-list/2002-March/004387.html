<PRE>Hello Richard,

   I do agree with everything you had to say.  But the issue is that
lets say that we have to solve problem &quot;A&quot;, now maybe the Microsoft
implementation uses technique &quot;B&quot; to solve the problem.  And they patent
this technique &quot;C&quot;.

   Another developer might face problem &quot;A&quot; and solve the problem by
mechanism &quot;D&quot; which is not covered by the patent &quot;C&quot;.  So my
recommendation is to stay away from the code, because in this scenario
we get to implement things without having looked at &quot;B&quot; which might take
us down the path of infringing &quot;C&quot;.

   Our blind implementation might lead to infringe on &quot;C&quot;, but I rather
not blatantly start assimilating code that could have been done in
another way.

Miguel.
