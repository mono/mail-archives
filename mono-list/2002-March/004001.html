If you're talking about the dwarf-3 standard, this pops up an
important questions:

Should I produce &quot;good&quot; an clean dwarf-2 code (ie. exactly as it's
described in the dwarf-2 specification) or only use features which are
already supported by gdb ?

At the moment, I'm writing good code, but this forces people to use at
least gdb 5.1.1 (the latest released version), it does not work with
gdb 5.0.

IMO it makes sense to produce good dwarf-2 code since mono is a very
long living project and will still take several months until its
completion and gdb should have full dwarf-2 support in near future.
