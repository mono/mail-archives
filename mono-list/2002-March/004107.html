</I>Adam Treat has sent the C#/Qt bindings to me - ready for an initial checkin to 
the KDE cvs. As soon as kdebindings has been tagged for KDE 3, I'll be able 
to add them to the HEAD branch (eg another week). Then perhaps we can add C# 
Qt/KDE bindings to the KDE 3.1 release schedule, and work towards that. If 
you'd like to see the stuff before then, mail Adam or myself and we'll send 
it to you.

They'll go in the KDE kdebindings module under kdebindings/qtcsharp, and the 
accompanying C bindings are in kdebindings/qtc. The utility used to generate 
the bindings is in kdebindings/kalyptus (Adam has added a C# P/Invoke 
bindings generation option).
