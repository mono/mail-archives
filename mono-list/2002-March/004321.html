Don't you think a moderated list would be better?

I think the best solution here is probably to allow a select few to post
to the mailing list, but to still allow all those interested to sign up
to see the discussion.

I don't however know if there's mailinglist software around that can be
set up this way...

The only danger that you end up with is that people that disagree with
the views of the posters contact them directly, but you essentially have
that already (and a filter in your mail client should be able to
separate the wheat from the chaff).

Sincerely,

Tom
