<PRE>This seems a little less serious than Sun's outright claims of
contamination, which I find deeply offensive (if you have looked
at Sun's source code, you can't work on your own Java implementation
or anything like it--maybe not even Mono).  But it still raises
alarm bells.

Overall, I'd recommend not looking at the source code for a system
that you are trying to re-implement in open source.  On general
principles, that can only cause serious legal problems.  Often, the 
solutions open source developers come up with on their own are better
anyway, since by the time they implement the stuff, they already
know the complete, published API.
