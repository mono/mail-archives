<PRE>Hiyas.

Chanting the mantra &quot;Microsoft is the Evil Empire&quot;, has allowed us to walk straight into the arms of Sun.

There are some of us who do not believe that Sun is any more commited to altruistic action outside their  profits than Microsoft... they are all hulking great gorillas out to make the biggest buck they can.

Some are interested in C# and .NET because a) they simply like it, and believe it to be well designed, and b) it has been through an independent standardisation process which offer levels of freedom from corperate impreatives that Java does not (yes there are other standards bodies one might prefer, but the ECMA will do).

I personaly am attracted by web services and strong contracts for distributed computing, rather than a world where everything is coded in Java... if Java is you prefered language, yay you!... I have several languages that I use for different things currently Python, Prolog, and C#.. sometimes all together interoperating... if you prefer to just use Java again, yay you!

Come back when Sun has the balls to put Java through ECMA rather than yanking it.

So, reverting to your consideration of Java as a platform on which to implement another language, rather than just another language... performance.

These sorts of discusions are rarely productive, as they have as much to do with world views as they do anything. For you the issue is quite black and white, for me its all just a sea of gray.

Cheers,
	Guy.

&gt;<i> Despite any implementation obstacles, Mono is much less encumbered than
</I>&gt;<i> a .NET-in-Java implementation can be; I don't understand why people
</I>&gt;<i> consider Sun some kind of benevolent dictator and Microsoft the Evil
</I>&gt;<i> Empire (tm).
</I>

Microsoft is &quot;the evil Empire&quot;!  ;-)

This is not about Sun vs Microsoft. This is not about Microsoft. . This 
is about not need to own the latest windows, or window att all. Isn't 
that what mono is all about, when they want mono to run on linux?

If NET &quot;is so good!&quot; then it should excises on other platforms, and 
since there is a Java VM for almost every platform, then running NET on 
that would be great. Not because it is SUN and because MS &quot;is the evil 
empire!&quot; It will simply make good sense!

It is very hard to discuss this with some people, because all they can 
or &quot;want to know&quot; is Windows. They have invested maybe 1000-10.000  of 
hours on learning to do window programming, then it is very hard to 
start looking outside windows. But there is a beautyful world outside 
MS, full of wonderful OS'es.

Java is a billion dollar industry. You have Application Servers, costing 
10.000 of dollars, running hardware costing 100.000 dollars. So Java is 
not &quot;the next greatest after NET&quot;. NET is still a baby compared to Java. 
Just because it dos not come from MS, dos not mean that it is bad!

So this should not be a discussion on &quot;who is best&quot;, but how to make NET 
run on other platforms, and I think &quot;with my limited knowledge of NET&quot; 
that Java would be a good place to start the discussion.

C++ is an option, but is is not as easy to port to other platforms as 
Java.

I myself runs Win, Linux and Mac OS X. The win is only for games!

Niels Peter
