<PRE>Hi,

I don't know if this is the correct place for this. If not can someone 
direct me to the correct place. I have written a C# documentation tool in 
C#, this was motivated by the poor quality tool provided by Microsoft. It 
is still in the alpha phase of development but I believe it is already 
better than the Microsoft tool. It has been released under the GNU GPL 
although I am not sure it will be much use in the current form as it uses 
regular expressions.

If anyone wants to take a look it is available at 
<A HREF="http://www.softsteel.co.uk/tutorials/cSharp/lesson19.html.">http://www.softsteel.co.uk/tutorials/cSharp/lesson19.html.</A>

Thanks for listening,

Andy
