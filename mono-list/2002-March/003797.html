</I>&gt;<i> relationship ;-)
</I>Oh dear - I did wonder about whether Mono could do that. Is it a feature which 
is on the way, or is there some technical reason why it won't be done?

&gt;<i> &gt; More virtual method callbacks in the QtC bindings are needed if you want
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to do more than just customize event handling though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is not on the horizon yet.  I am going to try and fix all the kinks in
</I>&gt;<i> the bindings first and then worry about more advanced aspects like this a
</I>&gt;<i> little later.
</I>The extra callbacks aren't too difficult to generate, I had thought they would 
make the libraries too large, but it doesn't add too much (eg third Mb for 
Qt). If I do that for java, it should be simple to add much the same thing to 
the C bindings.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 2.  Several Qt classes are missing methods and constructors because...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 3.  The type mappings are not completely fleshed out
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do you mean you need to complete the runtime conversion functions to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; convert between C# and Qt types?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, I just need to complete the mappings and deal with things like multiple
</I>&gt;<i> methods with C parameter types that map to singular C# parameter
</I>&gt;<i> types.  For instance QString has duplicate methods 'contains' and
</I>&gt;<i> 'section'. I say they are duplicate because one takes 'const char' and
</I>&gt;<i> other 'char' for C parameters but currently these _both_ map to the C# type
</I>&gt;<i> 'string'.  This is probably an incorrect mapping, but that was what I was
</I>&gt;<i> referring to.  We also have the issue of using QString at all or
</I>&gt;<i> engineering the bindings in such a way that you would just use the C#
</I>&gt;<i> 'string' type and then map that to QString behind the scenes and use that
</I>&gt;<i> to call the C function.  These are issues I'll be dealing with now that the
</I>&gt;<i> bindings compile.
</I>I prefer to hide QString. If there is more than one method with the same name 
taking different sorts of C++ string args and mapping onto a single 
java.lang.String method in Java, I go for the one with a 'QString' arg and 
junk the others.

&gt;<i> &gt; If you can do it for 300+ Qt classes, then it's just more of the same for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; KDE.. You can convert KDE kdoc comments to C# style xml, which should be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fun though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yah, the KDE classes are next.  I am going to refine the qt bindings first
</I>&gt;<i> though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Congratulations!  Would you like to put this on CVS?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, agreed! And the code is also most welcome in the kdebindings CVS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; too. Maybe it wouldn't do any harm to have it in both places. But if you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; check in the kalyptus C# + P/Invoke bindings code generation option into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; kdebindings, I would be happy to help tweak it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please add the QtC bindings to the Mono cvs too, if people want them
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; together, that's fine with me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will be happy to put this in cvs.  The qtc# bindings will require the qtc
</I>&gt;<i> bindings so... to go in mono's cvs would probably require those qtc
</I>&gt;<i> bindings. Either way, let me polish up the bindings and I'll have something
</I>&gt;<i> to put in there very soon.
</I>OK good. The QtC license is LGPL (is that ok with Mono?), and I noticed you 
had a GPL header in the example you sent me.
