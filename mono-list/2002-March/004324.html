<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Closed.  That way, we can avoid the average Slashdot kid that reads the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; archives to make a big deal out of something that is not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Don't you think a moderated list would be better?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the best solution here is probably to allow a select few to post
</I>&gt;<i> to the mailing list, but to still allow all those interested to sign up
</I>&gt;<i> to see the discussion.
</I>
There are two issues:

	* Technical debates that need to be discussed in private
	  (gnome has gnome-private, kde has or used to have kde-private).

	* People have in the past pointed out to a public/moderated mailing list
	  to start their own flame wars or to try to prove a point 
	  without looking at the big picture, or partially quoting a 
	  private thread. 

These are not hypothetical situations, these have happened in the past
in GNOME. 
 
I also want to discuss timing, strategy and partially confidential
information with a group of people, and I needed an avenue for that.  I
could just assemble a large CC list, but this is more convenient for
everyone. 

I can probably split things up, so we can have mono-private and
mono-hackers and have the same split that GNOME has (gnome-hackers and
gnome-private).  But in any case, there will be a private list for
developers.

Miguel.
