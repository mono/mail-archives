<PRE>|<i> I am new comer in the field of .NET and C#, so I tried out writing a test
</I>|<i> suite as suggested in your web. For me its the first project where I see
</I>|<i> that it is rather easy to start contributing, good job.
</I>
Welcome!  Glad to hear that it was that easy.

|<i> I attached the test file to the e-mail (SortedListTest.cs). It should be
</I>|<i> placed under:
</I>|<i> msc/class/corlib/Test/System.Collections/SortedListTest.cs
</I>|<i> Of course, a row has to be added into AllTests.cs in that dir.
</I>
One comment about the way you used AssertEquals().  You should put the
expected value as the 2nd parameter, and the actual value as the third.
NUnit will provide a nice message saying &quot;...Expected &lt;blah&gt; but got
&lt;halb&gt;..&quot; or some such. So, you don't need to build up your own error
message in AssertEquals().

|<i> All tests passed on my Windows XP Professional box, except the test of
</I>|<i> SortedList.Clear() method:
</I>|<i> - it seems there is a contradiction with the MSDN documentation, which
</I>|<i> claims that the Clear() method leaves the Capacity unchanged, whereas the
</I>|<i> Capacity is altered.
</I>
We have a place to document these kind of discrepancies.  Please add an
entry to mcs/class/doc/API-notes.  You'll see examples there.  I also click
that link on the bottom of the MSDN docs to report &quot;feedback&quot; and tell them
directly about it.  Both times I did so, I got a reply thank you from
Microsoft.  It wasn't just an automated response, mind, it was a real human
being taking the time to thank me.  Unusually nice.

|<i> Main ToDos:
</I>|<i> - tests for properties of fixed-size and read-only (tests for catching
</I>|<i> NotSupportedException). I didnt know an easy way to change the initial
</I>|<i> values of these properties in SortedList.
</I>
I think unless you construct a SortedList with an IDictionary parameter that
is already fixed-size or read-only, then these will be false. To test this
you will probably have to create your own class that implements IDictionary
and returns true for those methods, then construct a SortedList from that.
I'm not sure if there is a built in class that is fixed-size and implements
IDictionary.  Anyone else know?

|<i> - IEnumerable.GetEnumerator [Explicit Interface Implementation].
</I>|<i> Could not
</I>|<i> figure out what to do with such strange thing. :(
</I>
You need to call GetEnumerator() on a SortedList to test this.  See
TestGetEnumerator() in mcs/class/corlib/Test/ArrayTest.cs for an example of
this.

Thanks and welcome aboard!
Nick D.
