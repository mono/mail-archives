    I'm ethically on firm ground, which helps me speak my mind .

But I'm not what you'd like to call a good coder . ( And I'm a bit too 
honest for my own good ;)

</I>
    Yeah I know what &quot;slashdottish&quot; means. 
    
    But I have my integrity and I have made sure I don't criticize any 
person without sufficent reason.

    Also in case you mistook this thread, this discussion was not about
&quot;Mono vs DotGNU&quot; -- this was about the X11 license in general and the
risk it carries for the freedom of software.
    
Speaking about flame bait , all I posted were facts AFAIK . About offtopic,
the thread has held its topic of the X11 license and issues -- and I don't 
think I'm a troll ( no links to goatse.cx yet..... ;).

I don't consider Ximian as a &quot;fellow coder&quot;. I consider it as Ximian Inc,
and Mono as go-mono.com . I think I have showed my respect for the coder
in all my mails.

    Also you may look down upon my .signature, but that was a precaution.
I had the experience of being on the recieving end from Lupus when I 
misattributed &quot;Andy Satori&quot; as a mono contributer.
    
    Look through that pile of junk I've sent and tell me when I refused
to respect a good developer . As I usually say &quot;give respect , take respect&quot;.
(and that applies for all -- dotgnu or mono).

&gt;<i> *Your posts were the most untechnical of all I've seen on this list. So 
</I>
    I thought that the technical discussion was shifted to Mono-hackers
or Mono-private ?. 

    Also for me and many other the ethical issues are as important as
the technical ones are.

&gt;<i> I herewith consider this topic closed and will refrain from answering 
</I>&gt;<i> any correspondence on it.
</I>
    Offer accepted. I'll do the same here. 

&gt;<i> c# ya,
</I>
    LOL !. but I'm still coding in good old C.
