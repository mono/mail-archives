Yes, just about 30 mins after I fired that email off, I downloaded the 
lates mono and low and behold, I was able to compile some sample QT 
programs using it, in Linux nonetheless. I was shocked and stupified to 
say the least, but that is a Good Thing(tm).

I took a trip over to the Trolltech website, and Googled around a bit, 
but was unable to find any information on a free developers release of 
Qt 3.0 for Windows. (there is a commercial version, but as a poor 
student I have not the funds for such a thing). Do the QtC / QtCSharp 
bindings work / build with Qt 2.3 ? If so, I'll start messing around 
with a Windows build.

Re the Windows.Forms, I now realize after checking out the bindings and 
how they are implimented I was a bit over-enthusiastic. I was just 
excited that I no longer have to depend on Windows for my GUI C# 
development. Nonetheless, I am definitly going to be keeping an eye on 
QtCSharp's status.

Keep up the good work Adam!
