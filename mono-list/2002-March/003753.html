<PRE>Hi, all.  I've been lurking here for a few days, ever since I found out
about Mono.  I'm excited about the idea of portable executables based on the
.NET runtime environment, and I'd like to find some way I can help.

My day job is commercial WinForm development in C#.  Naturally, that means
working in the Win2k/XP environment.  Typical of this occupation, I put all
my energy into my work, so I wouldn't be much help during the week, but
perhaps I can be useful on weekends.

I have about 19 years of industry experience, wrote a book about C, used C++
professionally for years, and have recently discovered C#.  My professional
background is 100% MS/Windows.  For fun, I operate a SuSE 7.2 Linux box at
home as a primary domain controller, and to host sendmail, majordomo, and
httpd.  Connected to it are two WinXP boxes, one of which hosts .NET and
VS.NET.  I have a cygwin environment on the XP box, if that's of any
importance.

If someone can provide some initial guidance (is there a FAQ?), perhaps I
can get set up this weekend and be contributing to the effort soon.  Please
feel free to contact me via personal email.

    Jerry in Bothell
