<PRE>Hello,
My name is Daniel Carrera and I am a graduate student in mathematics.

I saw the following on the Mono website:

&quot;      We have many classes, but we have not implemented in many cases the
serialization and re-incarnation support in them (this is pretty straight
forward code, and simple, but there is a lot to be done here).&quot;


That sounds like something I could work on.  I love programming, but I'm
not particularly experienced.

If the above is as straight forward as it sounds I thought that I could
have a crack at it.  I cannot offer any kind of commitment because I have
many other oblications.  I know that doesn't sound good, but I'd rather
be upfront.  On the other hand, I am quite happy doing things that most
hackers would find boring.


My experience:  I do most of my programming in Perl I am a good Perl
programmer.  I still use some C.  I have written programs in many other
languages, but I don't have extensive experience in any of them.  In
particular I don't know C++, Java or C#.


Could someone list the steps I should take if I want to make
contributions?

Thanks a lot,
Daniel.
