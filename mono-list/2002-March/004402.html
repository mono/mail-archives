POSIX has standardized the command-line interface to the C compiler.
Unfortunately there is no similar standard for the interface to the
C# compiler.

IMHO it would be a good idea to support a single command line interface
for all C# compilers -- MS, Mono, and Portable.Net -- and thus create a
de facto standard for this.  Supporting the same command-line interface
would make it much easier for people who are writing software that should
work with any C# compiler.

One way to do this would be to just add support for Microsoft's
command-line interface to the .NET and Mono C# compilers.  Another way
to do it would be to define a Unix-like command-line syntax, and write
a wrapper for Microsoft's csc that would convert the Unix-like syntax
into Microsoft's syntax and then invoke csc.  Software written in C#
could ship with this wrapper program included.

I don't really mind which way it is done, but it would certainly be nice
if the different C# compilers could all support the same command-line
interface.
