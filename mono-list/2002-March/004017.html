<PRE>Hello!

&gt;<i> Note that LCC is not &quot;open source software&quot; in the sense defined by
</I>&gt;<i> www.opensource.org; selling derivative works is not permitted, in general,
</I>&gt;<i> without buying a separate license from Addison-Wesley.
</I>
Yes, we did notice that.  It is unfortunate as you point out.  The idea
of this is just an exercise in writing a CIL back-end for LCC as a proof
of concept.  And then you could also do neat things with it.

The long term solution would be to do this with gcc, but this is a
smaller, easier compiler to understand. 

&gt;<i> But if you do want to port LCC to target IL, it might be a good idea
</I>&gt;<i> to check to see if anyone has done this already, e.g. by asking in
</I>&gt;<i> comp.compilers.lcc.
</I>
Completely agreed.  We did some searching on google and were not able to
find anything about it.  I know that some of the original lcc developers
did a port to the CIL at Microsoft, but I do not know of the code having
being released. 

It might be worth sending them e-mail directly.

Miguel.
