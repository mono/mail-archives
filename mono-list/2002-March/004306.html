    I think the design of CLR is quite good. But the whole .NET idea
is what MS had promised with COM , later with DCOM and now with CLR.

    ECMA Spec ?. That's the biggest con M$ pulled. The ECMA spec has
a mere 300 classes while the .NET is home for zillions more .

&gt;<i> I personaly am attracted by web services and strong contracts 
</I>&gt;<i> for distributed computing, 
</I>
    That's what frightens me -- M$ control is possible once .NET 
starts verifying the structure of your hard disk and starts reporting 
it to M$ to help build a better product. Yes, it will be easy to turn
it off -- but how many will know is another issue.

&gt;<i> rather than a world where everything is coded in Java... if Java

</I>    
    Java is a language -- JVM is a platform. I have seen Assemblers,
compilers targeting the JVM. One of my friends wrote a small compiler
for JVM (using Apache BCEL) based on BASIC-80.

&gt;<i> currently Python, 
</I>
    Check out jython it can compile python to .class files.

&gt;<i>.. if you prefer to just use Java again, yay you!
</I>
    Have you ever looked at the JVM .class files, they are so simple
in structure , unlike the MZ'd executables of M$ .NET . First you have
to take care of all the junk associated with a standard EXE , after that
the stack based code too.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, reverting to your consideration of Java as a platform on which 
</I>&gt;<i> to implement another language,
</I>
    The JVM has lesser instructions than CLR . The obvious misses are
the pointer instructions (don't tell me these are easily portable !).
The possibility is very limited in that case.

    But Java is here , Sun is not. MS is here, C# is not.
