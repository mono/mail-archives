Well, I'm not a lawer, but as far as I understand the German law, it'd
be a legal offense in my country to contribute any code to the Mono
project (since that'd be seen as an act of &quot;publishing&quot; this code)
which violates anyone's copyright.

So even if there's no protected from the projects point of view, IMO
there's still the little &quot;protection&quot; that anyone who does this would
most likely commit a legal offense in his country and can be held
liable for this.

I don't know what happens if any copyrighted code ever ends up in Mono
and Microsoft or anyone else sues us, but IMO the project could then
sue the person who committed this code and ask him for a compensation
for his damage.

However, I'm not a lawer, this is just my understanding of the law ...
