<PRE>Hi Piers,

Are we are talking about implementing the MSIL (microsoft intermediate
language) into a chip instead of another version of assembly language
(i.e. x86, 680x0, PowerPC, Java byte code, etc...).  This is a horrible
idea in that it locks the constructs that can be used in MSIL byte code
because one can not upgrade a chip as easily as one can upgrade
software.  I also do not see the point -- one compiles (ie. JIT
compilation) MSIL into x86 assembly (or any other processor assembly
language) anyways before running it anyways.  Thus the only benefit is
that one does not have to JIT code before running it.  But even this
benefit is minimal considering that .NET currently caches the result JIT
binaries between sessions.  I think that Intel's efforts would be better
spent on just plain better processors and compilers (which could be
taken advantage of by MSIL though intelligence JIT'ing) rather that an
MSIL specific processor.

But maybe I am wrong and you do mean a processor that implements the CLR
(common language runtime).  I am not sure how this would work but it
would have to be a really complex chip and the first time there is a bug
found in the CLR code it would be obsolete or it would need a microcode
update.  What language would a CLR-implementing chip run?  MSIL or
something else?

Sorry for being so negative on the idea... :-/  Maybe I am missing
something vital, and if so please enlighten me.

Cheers,
