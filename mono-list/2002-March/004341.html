    Mono did not use X11, the libraries were LGPL'd originally. Why they
would UNGPL a product (and lose moral standing in the free software 
community), is not my point to explain.

&gt;<i> There was discussion about why. It amounts to &quot;they wanted support from

</I>
    If Intel &amp; HP had *really* wanted to contribute, they would have 
used LGPL. This smells of the Microsoft's &quot;Viral Software&quot; point.

    But this is a much discussed topic -- I could go on like this.
But what's the point ?. Mono has chucked free software philosophy
out of the window for Intel &amp; others's help.
