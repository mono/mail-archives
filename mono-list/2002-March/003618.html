<PRE>|<i> I'm loving the new Class Status page and it has already helped me catch
</I>|<i> quite a few bugs already this morning. I noticed a bit earlier that it's
</I>|<i> listing properties twice because it's listed under as both a MethodInfo
</I>|<i> *and* a PropertyInfo. A little bit of testing and playing around, and 5
</I>|<i> minutes later, I got a patch that'll fix that.

Yeah. Not easy, I remember :). I mentioned this in the TODO file in the
corcompare directory.

I would prefer to remove the get_* and set_* methods from the status list
and show the property with &quot;get;&quot; and/or &quot;set;&quot; inside the curly braces
instead.  So, for example, AppDomainSetup would have under it:
LoaderOptimization{ get; set; } and there would be no methods shown at all.

The only problem with that is how to mark the get/set as missing or todo as
appropriate. I guess the property should be considered &quot;missing&quot; if either
one is missing.  If neither is missing then if either of them are marked as
&quot;todo&quot; the property should be todo.  In any case, it's not a big issue since
either way the thing needs love from someone.
