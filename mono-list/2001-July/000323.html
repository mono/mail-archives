Firstly, hi all!  I have a few comments and a couple of questions (in =
that order), but I'll endeavour to keep it short.

a) On the subject of Basic, GNOME Basic is a VBScript-a-like to emulate =
the Visual Basic for Applications in Excel.  VBScript is quite different =
from the compiled VB implemented by Visual Basic 6, and that's been =
changed quite substantially for VB.NET.  I expect that portions of the =
GB grammar could be used, but I would think it would be safer to produce =
the rest of the code from scratch.

b) On the subject of &quot;a novel approach to compilers&quot;, I think it was =
titled, am I wrong in thinking that System.CodeDom provides a rich =
abstract syntax tree which could be the input to a common IL generator?  =
Looking through the .NET documentation from Visual Studio.NET Beta 2, =
Microsoft provides an ICodeCompiler implementation for C# and for =
VB.NET, which can produce code from a CodeDom.  Is this not very close =
to the novel approach?

And finally, the questions...

1) I am an experienced C++ programmer, with good Java experience and a =
good working knowledge of C#.  I have written compilers, parsers and =
bytecode interpreters, and I am an experienced x86 assembly language =
programmer.  What is the best place for me to get involved at this time? =
 I'm really interested in seeing an open source .NET implementation, and =
want to help out in the best way I can.  Is my best bet to just choose a =
library and start coding?

2) I've not read Microsoft's license thoroughly enough; is it OK to =
develop GPL/LGPL code within Visual Studio.NET?  I'm thinking about the =
recent Microsoft license that restricted the use of &quot;viral license&quot; =
tools with their libraries.

That's it, sorry about the length of the mail!
Mark.
