<PRE>Hello,

No one is working on Stack, so feel free clean up your code and submit
it.  As far as making a patch to add Synchronization stubs to ArrayList,
I would say hold off.  We're trying to keep things that are just stubbed
out from being put into the source tree.  Sometimes this has to be done
to get things to compile together nicely, but we're trying.  If you have
time to implement the whole thing, you should first contact Vlad at
<A HREF="mailto:vladimir@pobox.com">vladimir@pobox.com</A> to make sure he hasn't already started/finished it.
