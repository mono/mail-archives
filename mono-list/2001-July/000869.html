<PRE>Kunle:

Do you have a URL for that?  (All I've been able to find is an older version
of the same comparison which they used to show that COM+'s speed).  I'd be
interested to see what they used for the &quot;J2EE&quot; implementations.  See, to
me, the most fair comparison to ASP.NET is JSP running on Jakarta, the Java
Servlet reference implementation, both running against the same web server:
IIS.  However, I don't really picture them using that in a test.  I'd be
interested to see if they did that or went all the way to the JWS (Java Web
Server) that Sun sells for their comparison, which is a 100% Java web server
and isn't known for breakneck speed.

If they have the actual code for the ASP.NET version available, it would
likely be a simple port back to Jakarta.  I might do some playing with it
next week.

Sincerely,
Jay Freeman (saurik)

&gt;<i> &gt; Let me state it clearly again: I am really interested
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in seeing and understanding test cases where a CLR
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (theoretically or practically) outperforms a JVM.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm asking out of technical interest, to understand
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; both systems better, not to win an argument.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But the existence or non-existence of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; such cases also should be an important data point
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for the choices Mono makes wrt. a CLR implementation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There was the .NET version of the Nile.com ASP.NET sample site that MS put
</I>&gt;<i> out a while ago.....it was faster than the ASP/VC++/COM and ASP/VB/COM
</I>&gt;<i> solution which were in turn faster than the various J2EE versions if I
</I>&gt;<i> remember correctly.
</I>&gt;<i>
