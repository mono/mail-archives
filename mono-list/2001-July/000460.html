<PRE>Miguel:

Well, maybe I'm just doing this wrong, but I decided to try this and it
doesn't work.  I even made it easy on it, my test has EXPR and var_list be
tokens rather than complex expressions.  I copied this from a terminal
window, so the tabs aren't right, but here is the base of my test:

&lt;file name=&quot;vb.y&quot;&gt;
%token FOR VAR EXPR SOMETHING TO NEXT var_list

%%

body:
        /* nothing */
        | statement body
        ;

statement:
        for_statement
        | SOMETHING
        ;

for_statement:
        FOR VAR '=' EXPR TO EXPR body opt_next
        ;

opt_next:
        /* nothing */
        | NEXT var_list
        ;
&lt;/file&gt;

I am pretty sure I got this right.  This yields 5 shift/reduce conflicts.
If you put a defined deliniator around &quot;body&quot; in for_staement, such as '('
and ')', you can get it to work.  VB has statements that have to end in '\n'
or be separated by ':', so that helps a little, but I can't come up with a
good organization of separators that makes it both work _and_ not require
that there be two separators somewhere (example, if you are willing to
always have two enters at the end of for statements, that could work, but I
bet when you start adding more types even that would only be a temporary
hack).

Note that if you remove the empty expansion of opt_next (thereby requiring
separate Next statements) it works fine.  If need be I can do more research
and attempt to explain exactly _why_ this doesn't work, but for now all I
can really do is state that it doesn't.

Sincerely,
Jay Freeman (saurik)

</I>&gt;<i> Of course it can be parsed by yacc.

</I>&gt;<i> The grammar is not deterministic, and that is what you use the actions

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, you can not use yacc to build an error checking C# parser, nor
</I>&gt;<i> a Java one.  You need to delay those actions to the `actions'.  Just
