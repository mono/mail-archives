<PRE>Martin Coxall &lt;<A HREF="mailto:martin.coxall@itouch.co.uk">martin.coxall@itouch.co.uk</A>&gt; wrote about me:

&gt;<i> I am sure we'll all extend to him our warmest thanks for his
</I>&gt;<i> attempts to destroy relations with Mono by excluding those who
</I>&gt;<i> subscribe to the mono-list if they use the word &quot;we&quot; or dare
</I>&gt;<i> claim that Mono is worth the effort.
</I>
To the leaders of the Mono project:

I would like to make two corrections:

1. Martin Coxall was not banned from any of the DotGNU lists.
   What I did was set things up so that posts from him will be
   moderated manually.  If he chooses to make posts that seek to
   move the DotGNU project forwards towards its goals, and which
   do not misrepresent his relationships to the DotGNU and Mono
   projects, then these posts will be accepted (regardless of
   whether I personally agree with his opinions or not).

2. I have no problem with his claim that &quot;Mono is worth the
   effort&quot;.  I even personally agree with that statement.
   The problem is that his way of speaking with &quot;we&quot; and &quot;they&quot;
   about the two projects has started creating unacceptable
   amounts of confusion.

Finally, I believe that I can speak for the entire DotGNU core
team when I say that all the leaders of the Mono project are
very welcome to join any of the public DotGNU mailing lists and
start discussing any form of cooperation that you may find
desirable.  (Just identify yourself as who you are, and there
will be no confusion :-)  Alternatively, you are also very
welcome to bring up any matter outside of the public lists by
contacting us via the non-public mailing list <A HREF="mailto:coreteam@dotgnu.org">coreteam@dotgnu.org</A>

Greetings, Norbert.
