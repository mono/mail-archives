<PRE>Okay, I think that its clear that the best option is to implement
anything apart from the standard in a separate namespace.  It seems to
me that diverging from the standard could potentially hurt us down the
road, and could confuse developers attempting to write applications that
will run on both Mono and Microsoft's implementation.

Secondly, I would like to note that in cases such as the cited
System.Security.Cryptography it would seem to make senes to make
proposed changes to the standard to the ECMA.  I know very little about
the ECMA, but for a standard to be effective and widely accepted,
opportunity for positive change should be available.  Would this be
possible?  It seems everyone would benefit from this kind of action.
