At this point, the toolchain is largely nonexistent.  The runtime is in the
prototype stage, and the GC is still being researched.  The compiler is pretty
far along, but you can only run it on windows, as it is written in c#, so it
depends on the runtime.  The class library is coming along, but again, you
pretty much have to develop on windows, as that's the only place you can get a
compiler and runtime for the moment.
