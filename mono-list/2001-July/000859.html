At the risk of sounding naive, doesn't this make sense?  The CLR and C#
are basically the same technology as the JVM and Java.  Minor technical
differences aside (i.e. extra/different semantics, some type
differences, etc), the two platforms are more or less the same general
design with some changes in the details.  The only thing I see that
would lead me to believe that .NET had something new/better/interesting
is that they clearly define the ability for any language to compile to
the CLR (because of the CTS, if I understand everything correctly).

Had Sun chosen this path with Java, we would have the same language
choices.

In other words, why would anyone expect any significant difference in
performance, especially with .NET/C# being better?  If I'm correct in my
assumptions above, one would have to expect the Beta product (relatively
early in it's devel cycle, even if they have the benefit of &quot;lessons
learned&quot; from the development/growth of Java) to perform worse than the
mature, tuned, and refined product, yes?
