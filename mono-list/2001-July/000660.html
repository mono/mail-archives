<PRE>howdy folks,
i apologize in advance if this is not the right place to post this 
message. but i have been following the recent mono announcements very 
closely and i'm very excited to hear about the possibilities of the CLI 
(i've been thru the .so hell and back (well the linux equivalent of the 
.dll hell) for one) -- can't help the nested quotes either. been 
programming for too long.

i digress...
i must have missed something because i can't seem to figure out where to 
go from here... i downloaded the tarballs at go-mono.com. i compiled it. 
i have a few executables here and there but i cannot seem to make heads 
or tails of them. is there a working CLR? some web pages seem to 
insinuate that there is somewhat of a working CLR while i've seen it 
under TODO someplace else. could someone help me understand the 
tool-chain? i have been poking around to figure things out on my own but 
i'm making very slow progress. i also feel that i could contribute. 
(especially since i've been torn between languages, c++/python/java 
etc... and this is going to be 'code for sore fingers'). using the tools 
with no-options (or with --help just spits out a very brief message.) 
i'm going to spend the better half of today going thru the source code 
itself if all else fails to see what each executable does. but some 
pointers would be of great help..

TIA,
anoop.
