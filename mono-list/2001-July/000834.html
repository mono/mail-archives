Would you STOP IT ALREADY?

How many people have to yell at you before you stop?

I have no idea what Barry Fitzgerald's point was that you're
supposedly proving, but I suspect it's something like &quot;Martin Coxall
is being a petty, petulant child.&quot;  You certainly are demonstrating
that point to an abundance.

I can only speak as a subscriber of the Mono list, but I'm very tired
of seeing this flame war go back and forth (and mostly coming from
you).  I'm sure that the dotGNU subscribers and contributors feel at
least as strongly as I do.

No purpose is served by dragging out the shouting any further; I think
everybody has seen quite enough to judge what happened for themselves.
Further argument only antagonizes people while accomplishing nothing.
