I've only thought about this very quickly, but here are my thoughts:

The IDL doesn't have to play a part in this.  It would be better to take
an existing CORBA object, and query it dynamically (using DII) to find
out what its types are, then generate the appropriate .NET interface
which is a small stub into the CORBA object.

This is the approach taken by the MS tool tlbimp, which takes a type
library and makes a .NET interface for it.

(You can do the same thing starting from IDL, but then you have to have
the IDL to begin with, and you have to write a parser for IDL).

&gt;<i> 2. Accessing .net objects as corba objects. On this subject, I don't know
</I>&gt;<i> anything :-)
</I>
Probably easiest to do it dynamically too, using DSI.

If you expose the .NET object as CORBA interfaces and types, other
people can use it without knowing anything about it.

But I will have to think about it some more to be sure.

Tyson.
