<PRE>First, a big Hullo to all on this list, this is my first post!

Then, my question:
	I am a (mainly) C/C++ programmer that really would like to contribute to 
this project. The problem, though, is that I have no experience with and 
doesn't really know much about anything related to .net (glanced a bit 
at C#, tho). I though the whole mess was nothing too great, probably 
because it was something innovative (gasp!) from MS, but after the 
recent Free Software initiatives (dotGNU and off course, mono) I got 
more interested...

	So, do anyone have any links to places where I can read more about this? 
how it works and so on? Something which gives poor ppl like me some kind 
of overview ;-)  Hmm... better put those links on your web-page, because 
else I'd guess the same question would repeat itself a few thousand 
times a day the following days/months/years ;-)

( I did look at the Resource page, but to starting with a look at those 
.net class libraries and the likes didn't make sense just yet, bear over 
with me!)

And... I have access to (but never tested) visual studio.net beta1, but 
the web page states that &quot;If you have looked at Microsoft's 
implementation of .NET or their shared source code, you may not be able 
to contribute to Mono.&quot;
err.. what do you think about that.. I'll keep my not-yet-dirty-hands 
off that cd, right?
;-)
