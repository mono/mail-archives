<PRE>&gt;<i> While that looks cute on paper, and can be syntactically expressed in Backus
</I>&gt;<i> Naur Form, that grammar isn't left recursive (with any lookahead, not just a
</I>&gt;<i> finite one) and can't be parsed by yacc.  That grammar isn't even
</I>&gt;<i> deterministic.  Do not pass go, do not collect the computer theorists' stamp
</I>&gt;<i> of appproval.
</I>
Of course it can be parsed by yacc. 

The grammar is not deterministic, and that is what you use the actions
for.

Indeed, you can not use yacc to build an error checking C# parser, nor
a Java one.  You need to delay those actions to the `actions'.  Just
like you would with the grammar I showed you for the for next.

Miguel.
