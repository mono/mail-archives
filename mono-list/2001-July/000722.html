<PRE>&gt;<i> 2) glib wouldn't build because of the &quot;extern char *strsignal()...&quot; in
</I>&gt;<i> g_strsignal() in gstrfuncs.c.  I read the threads here to help figure this
</I>&gt;<i> one out, and took the approach of commenting out the offending two lines.  I
</I>&gt;<i> think that configure is defining HAVE_STRSIGNAL when it shouldn't, but I'm
</I>&gt;<i> not sure where to look for that (yet :).
</I>
Look at the config.log file generated by glib, that will have a log of
why it thought it was ok to use.

&gt;<i> 3) Even thought glib was installed, when I tried to make mono, it told me
</I>&gt;<i> that it didn't know where glib-config was.  This was confusing because this
</I>&gt;<i> file was in the glib-1.2.10 directory that I unzipped.  What wasn't obvious
</I>&gt;<i> was that it should be using the one that was placed in c:\mono\bin.  I added
</I>&gt;<i> that directory to my PATH and all was well, but for a relative newbie this
</I>&gt;<i> would probably be a total stumper.
</I> 
Thanks for the report, I will update the web pages.

Miguel.
