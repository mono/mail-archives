<PRE>&gt;<i> [lots of things that are nice about the CLR]
</I>
I agree: the CLR has some nice features that the
JVM doesn't have.  And I think that's also true
for C# vs. Java.  OTOH, I don't believe any of
those niceties are of immediate relevance to the
goal of making Gnome desktop applications easier
to build (if that is the goal).

&gt;<i> But if we had
</I>&gt;<i> a free software implementation of the CLR, we could
</I>&gt;<i> fix those problems.
</I>
Well, if you start tinkering with the CLR, why
not start with an existing, working JVM and tinker
with it?  You could either come up with an &quot;extended
Java&quot; that's fully backwards compatible, or you could 
make the JVM support CLR.

In fact, the more I think about it, the more likely
it seems to me that future runtimes will simply
accept both JVM and CLR bytecodes.  I also think
most vendors will just use their existing Java 
runtimes as starting points and modify them to handle
both.

Tom.
