<PRE>Hello all,

I know we're a long way away from being able to actually write our
WinForms layer, I was wondering whether or not when desigining this (and
possibly other toolkit or OS-dependent parts of Mono) we would want to
allow multiple toolkits and implementations. In other words, should we
plan for multiple WinForms implementations so that other popular
toolkits or desktops can still use the base Mono code yet have GUI
applications mesh with their desktop? This would also allow Mono to run
GUI programs on other operating systems, such as QNX or BeOS (of which
I'm a closet advocate of).

This brings up another issue - how are we going to deal with presenting
needed Mono-specific functions without polluting the System.* namespace
with entities that really don't belong there? For instance, where would
a function to select the toolkit for WinForms parts go? In
System.WinForms.SelectToolkit()? in Mono.WinForms.SelectToolkit()? What
do you think?

Lastly, is anybody else interested in working on JScript support?

Cheers,

Brian
