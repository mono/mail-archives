<PRE>Hi people

After a rather confused period of trying to deny the technical merits of .NET I have come out a little wiser. And I'd like to help realise Mono :-)
I don't have a Windows machine running, so I can't really help with anything that relies on my ability to write C# code. On the other hand I have taken more than a few classes in compiler generation, optimizing compilers (SSA framework only) and runtime environments. I hope some of that will be useful to the project.
Anyway. I'd like to get involved in the VM design/construction hoopla from the very beginning.
On a legal note I'd like to add that I have not ever read one line of .NET source code published by Microsoft.
On a personal note I'd like to add that my first Linux distro was Slackware, I like experimental electronic music and I live with my girlfriend in Lund, Sweden :)

Please return some instructions on how to handle this mailing list and whatever other info any participant should know.
