<PRE>Hi,
	Has anyone pointed out/discussed that MS might be planning to
replace WindowsCE (or whatever it is called this week :-) by a natively-hosted
version of the .NET runtime?

Consider the advantages.... Most notably, processor independence - PDAs
(unlike desktop machines) have a plethora of processors all of which MS must compile it's
applications for.
(This is pretty-much what Inferno sets out to achieve, but without MS's marketing muscle!)

It would also mean that &quot;desktop&quot; applications could run (resources permitting) on
PDAs without modification.
Of course, one would need a wireless link to talk to the hated Passport servers.... 

Perhaps a native version of Mono should be considered for PDAs too? (Although I agree
that this is, perhaps, a rather early stage to be thinking about such things :-)

Perhaps this makes sense of why MS should be pushing a processor indepence strategy
just when the Wintel monopoly of the desktop is so well established! I bet Intel are wondering
too..... :-)

Martin
PS
	Has any one else pointed out the similarity between C# and Inferno's Limbo language
(Interface-based programming, JIT compilation, easy network services, etc)? As I noted in
<A HREF="http://www.zdnet.com/tlkbck/comment/22/0,7056,114376-874919,00.html,">http://www.zdnet.com/tlkbck/comment/22/0,7056,114376-874919,00.html,</A> the CLR is really
&quot;just&quot; a JIT version of ANDF :-), but like ANDF, also misses out on ANDF's more sophisticated
heritage.
