	Thank, I'll look into it right away :-)

	Unfortunately, there is no such document although I was planning
to write one soon. Lemme explain what we're upto right now :

	GB is not yet a full parser, it will be soon. The goals of the GB
project is to provide a 100% VB compatible interpreter for the GNOME
platform. This means that there will be (are) no differences between the
GB language spec and the VB 6.0 language spec :) Although we started off
as a project to help gnumeric execute VBA macros, we have since expanded
our goals to be a complete VB interpreter.

	Currently, we are focussing on writing a very solid core and
that's why our parser is undergoing a lot of change to become as robust
and as close to the VB core as possible.

	So, if you're interested in seeing the GB grammar file, you can
find it in the CVS module 'gb' in gb/grammar.y. It is fairly clean and
self explanatory so perhaps you'd like to take a look.

	I am quite sure that the goals of the GB project are rather
flexible and lend themselves to help with the Mono project.

	Regards,

		Ravi
