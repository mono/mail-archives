Again, I thank you for an interesting pointer (Visual Parser++). I 
downloaded the trial verison. Looks interesting, and so far, looks polished. 
I'll give it a test run over the next few days.

To clarify our discussion, you note that some people need a yacc-like parser 
for use in VB. Some people have written a yacc-like parser for use in VB. I 
noted that the ad in VBPJ was for services related to parsing of VB syntax. 
Which would be relevant to the subject line of this email. So a 3rd party VB 
syntax parser really does exist.

Bob.
