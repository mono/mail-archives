<PRE>&gt;<i> To make the point, I would say MS is going to be a lot more worried that
</I>&gt;<i> their IP is going to be contaminated by GPL than Mono needs to be of MS.
</I>&gt;<i> They don't even want to work on projects that have GPL code in them as that
</I>&gt;<i> same developer may then be contaminated.  The way the license works doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> let you say &quot;oh, we got sued because we didn't release the code, so we will
</I>&gt;<i> delete the GPL sections&quot;, it is more of a one-way deal, you used it, your
</I>&gt;<i> entire application is now under GPL, not just some infringing piece of it,
</I>&gt;<i> game over.  It was for this reason they once asked me to release my
</I>&gt;<i> decompiler as LGPL (as opposed to the GPL that my released, older version is
</I>&gt;<i> under) as they wanted to be able to offer assistance with it.
</I>
Lets please keep advocacy debate on the GPL and on Microsoft
intentions towards it to another forum.

The mono list should be used for coordination and technical
discussion.

Miguel.
