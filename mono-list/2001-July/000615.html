<PRE>Andy:

DOH, beat me to the punch by a few minutes :-).  My bet would be that their
expectation is to help in aspects such as refining specifications, answering
questions about inner aspects of the platform.

To make the point, I would say MS is going to be a lot more worried that
their IP is going to be contaminated by GPL than Mono needs to be of MS.
They don't even want to work on projects that have GPL code in them as that
same developer may then be contaminated.  The way the license works doesn't
let you say &quot;oh, we got sued because we didn't release the code, so we will
delete the GPL sections&quot;, it is more of a one-way deal, you used it, your
entire application is now under GPL, not just some infringing piece of it,
game over.  It was for this reason they once asked me to release my
decompiler as LGPL (as opposed to the GPL that my released, older version is
under) as they wanted to be able to offer assistance with it.

Sincerely,
Jay Freeman (saurik)

Subject: [Mono-list] Microsoft to help Mono?


&gt;<i> How would Microsoft help Mono (according to an article
</I>&gt;<i> on slashdot)?  Would Microsoft's help endanger Mono
</I>&gt;<i> because of Microsoft's help, or contributon, or
</I>&gt;<i> involvement, contaminates Mono with MS's IP or source code?
