 &gt; What about PHP.NET?  Since most Linux developers are going to be
 &gt; familiar with PHP, it seems logical to provide a .NET version.

Hmm, most?  I'm very doubtful.  I think C# and a constrained C++ would
be the most important for getting to Free Software developers.  Of
course, even if PHP isn't used by most, it does have a large user
base.

 &gt; The porting of ASP is still a valuable idea that should not be
 &gt; discarded.  However, one of the greatest aspects of .NET (IMHO) is
 &gt; the language independence.  A .NET implementation of PHP would just
 &gt; invite more innovation to the project.

I don't know PHP, but I imagine it would fit in the second-tier of
desirability, along with Perl and Python.  Which, as it happens, are
already being ported to .NET.  But I think this is an issue for the
PHP developers, not for Mono.  Personally, I want to see a Free
implementation of a Common Lisp-like lisp for Mono, but I don't think
that the Mono project itself should bother itself with implementing
languages outside the most important ones.  But it should certainly be
responsive to the needs of languages trying to target it.
