<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; I wonder, would it be posible for someone at Ximian to setup a cgi so that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it takes in a .cs file, compiles it and runs it returning all output
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; through the cgi? That way, those of us working blind can test code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ourselves.
</I>&gt;<i> This would really rock!
</I>&gt;<i> That way, people (like me) that want to contribute to the class but they
</I>&gt;<i> can't because they can't (or don't want) to use Windows will be able to
</I>&gt;<i> do it.
</I>
This makes a lot of sense, but I do not even know where to begin to
implement such a beast.  

I would love to work on this, but I have to focus on other areas of
Mono.  What we need here is someone with the expertise that can set
such a system up.

I can not host this at Ximian because our syadmins would go crazy
about having arbitrary code being fed to a compiler.  Just setting
this up is not going to be fun, and behind the firewall is something
my sysadmin will not let me do.

Miguel.
