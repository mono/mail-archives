 &gt; Our goal is very clear:
 &gt; 
 &gt; 	  We are trying to make a better platform for developing
 &gt;        applications for Unix.
 &gt; 
 &gt; We have chosen the .NET development platform as the vehicle for this.
 &gt; Being a very long time C code, and having witnessed how C# and .NET
 &gt; actually improved my efficiency compared to the traditional C +
 &gt; framework development, we want to write as much code as possible in C#
 &gt; and the .NET class libraries.
 &gt; 
 &gt; That means for example that our metadata library is only a tiny
 &gt; implementation designed for only reading assemblies.  Any kind of
 &gt; higher level support should be implemented in C#.  
 &gt; 
 &gt; The JIT engine will be in C, because I can not think of any other way
 &gt; of doing it with C#.  If I had a chance, I would do it in C#, believe
 &gt; me.  But the less C, the better. 

If your JIT engine included the ability to dump and reload binary
images, couldn't you bootstrap it off of the bytecode interpreter?

(Thinking out loud),
Tom
