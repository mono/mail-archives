Wow what a great quote:
&quot;Have you written a great piece of code that you want to share? Are you
looking for some great code samples? Tap into the largest pool of code
samples produced by your fellow developers through CodeSwap, a Visual =
Studio
.NET add-in for the .NET developer community. &quot; www.vscodeswap.net =
=A92001

I thought freshmeat.net or sourceforge.org would be the &quot;largest pool =
of
code samples produced by [my] fellow developers&quot;.  hmm, or maybe =
ibiblio?
what a crock.
I guess this could be seen as list spamming, but it really is =
pertinent.  It
is a great example of Microsoft embracing and extending.  We like Open
source, so they like opensource.  they like it so much, they want to =
hug it
and squeeze it until it dies.
