No problem, look - I've been moderated before - I know what it feels
like.  I understand what you're thinking now quite clearly.  And, I've
been a moderator as well - so, I see both sides.  Neither one is
particularly fun.

Listen, I don't think that things are precisely what they seem like.  I
appreciate your cooling down, but please listen to reason here and let's
try to undo some of the damage that was caused here.  There's no reason
for it.

And, by all means, let's get this off mono-list!  These people don't
need to be involved.  It's a non-issue.
