<PRE>Hi,
	I have heard someone say that they are putting together a list of who is
working on what class within the library and I had an idea. When I was a php
programmer I really liked  the way they created their documentation
(<A HREF="http://www.php.net/manual/en/">http://www.php.net/manual/en/</A>). Its a large hierarchy of documentation and
user supplied comments. I think that it would be really great if we could
use something similar during the development.

I think that since there is so much class reuse within the .net library,
there are going to be alot of times when one coder needs to work with
another coder about bugs..etc. Since its publicly available and categorized
by nature, it makes it easy to see if an issue is already documentated. Also
it could eventually evolve to serve as formal documentation.

Is there something similar already done that we can use? I know that
bugzilla is a good way to track the bugs, but would it be appropriate for
user documentation? I don't think  sourceforge has this either.

If there isn't me and a friend would be happy to create it.

Let me know what you guys think.

-Allen
