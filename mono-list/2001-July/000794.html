<PRE>&gt;<i> 2. I have no problem with his claim that &quot;Mono is worth the
</I>&gt;<i>    effort&quot;.  I even personally agree with that statement.
</I>&gt;<i>    The problem is that his way of speaking with &quot;we&quot; and &quot;they&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>    about the two projects has started creating unacceptable
</I>&gt;<i>    amounts of confusion.
</I>
Confusion? Hands up here who is confused with the concept of me using &quot;we&quot; to 
refer to dotGNU when posting there, and &quot;we&quot; to refer to Mono when posting 
here? Anyone?

No, I thought not. Mr Bollow, your excuse for banning me seems lame. Maybe 
your mind is feeble enough that the word &quot;we&quot; causes confusion, but I don't 
think anyone else on dotGNU is that imbecilic.

You banned me because you didn't like me promoting Mono. Pure and simple.
