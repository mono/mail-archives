<PRE>Hello all,

I have several thoughts about the Mono development:

1. Shouldn't we begin, for the classes, to define which classes NEED
bindings on existing libs and which classes should be built on top of it,
written in C# ? That would be a great step to begin the development of new
classes in &quot;pure&quot; C#?

2. How about a policy on implementing binding to classes who could bind to
linux or gnome libs ? Like : Always bind when available. Or Always write a
pure C# version and THEN bind if you want. Or If and only if someone opened
a tree in the CVS for a C# version, you can take over the binding version of
the class. etc.

3. Is the mono project means running .net programs on top of Linux (and thus
be able to run most .net programs on Linux if developed under windows
seamlessly) or not? That should answer the question &quot;should we prefer
compatibility first and think about divergent classes later in a different
namespace ?&quot; and prohibit ideas about having two different set of classes,
some of them not compatible.

4. Shouldn't we split the mailing list, one on the classes dev, one on the
JIT/parsers ?

5. Licensing is definitely an issue for the reasons I mentioned in my &quot;RE :
[Mono-list] using lgpl in mono class libraries&quot;.

Based on the answers, we should be able to develop the classes quite fast.

As the mail title is talking about &quot;thoughts&quot;, I wanted to let you know who
I am and what I can do / want to do, in my group and in the mono project.

I'm Sebastien Lambla, you already guessed it. I'm one of the early people
involved in the peer2peer space. I'm the founder and current president of
the gPulp Consortium, the first European peer2peer standard body (you could
say kind of the W3C but for P2P). Enough about me.

I, as an individual, would like to get involved in the Mono project, because
I really think it would be a tremendous addition to the Linux system as a
whole to get &quot;native&quot; support for the tools most people will be using in a
not too far future.
I am available to work as a dev for pure C# classes (don't know enough of
the Linux system to do any bindings). I should add that C# libraries for the
DIF protocol and the gPulp Protocol will be published in a few months, which
would give a pure C# library to use peer 2 peer technologies in the .net
framework.

I think this message is already waaaaaaaaay too long.

Have a nice day,

Sebastien Lambla
