No, I don't think that we can leave it there.

Moderated is not the same thing as banned.  I've tried to stay out of
this as much as possible, but this accusation is intolerable.  You were
moderated ultimately to stop a public flame war on the list over C# -vs-
Java.  It's that simple.  The thread needed to be stopped.  If you
haven't noticed, we've decided to go with BOTH C# and Java bytecode
implementations.  Having this level of compatibility is the best thing
that we can possibly do.  There's no &quot;anti-C# impropriety&quot; here.  If you
had just gone on your way, e-mailed the coreteam in private to find out
what was going on, and then let things cool down, then there would have
been no problems whatsoever.  But, no - you had to throw a childish
temper tantrum, mass mailing everyone on the list with a foolish
extension to what was becoming a flame war.  If your intention was to
promote cooperation between the groups, then this is a very odd way of
trying to promote that goal and it makes me very suspect.  If you'll
read the archives, we've had absolutely NO problem with people from
other projects coordinating with us.  In fact, we're doing so on a
regular basis.  I, personally, am HIGHLY disappointed in the
unprofessional nature to which you have dealt with this.  If this
project has lost any momentum due to your use of FUD, I believe that
history will back our side of the story.  Thank you, and things could
have gone entirely different if you had simply stood back and cooled
down first.  Keep that in mind - and I suggest that that's what you do
now.

After saying this, I welcome a response - but please be ABSOLUTELY sure
to have cooled down before you respond.  

The above accusation is simply incredulous and ludicrous.
