On a point of order: No, I didn't disagree with you.

Look at the list archives, I generally agreed with your points on Java
licensing restrictions.  The tone of the thread seemed to be getting
hot.  On a list that carried a considerable amount of traffic, flame
wars are not permissible.

Please see:

messages in question - in full this time, not clipped like in your
e-mail to everyone else)

While this thread does not actually reach the point of a flame war, it
only takes a moment to for any right-thinking person to see where it's
heading.  And the message that you sent to Norbert after the last one
never made it to the list BECAUSE you were moderated.  Had it made it to
the list, a flame war would have ensued.

And, now one has ensued...

Are you happy?


 
&gt;<i> &gt; The thread needed to be stopped.

</I>&gt;<i> How dare you? Really, how DARE you tell me what to think?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I never told you what to think - I told you my opinion of what needed to
happen with the thread.  That's not telling you what to think.  Not in
the least.  Stopping a thread is at the discretion of the moderator. 
This is true everywhere.

It's just usually not a big deal.

</I>&gt;<i> nothing further to do with a free software project who openly censors
</I>&gt;<i> proponents of competing viewpoints and complementary projects.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Then why are you still here?

We don't openly censor proponents of competing viewpoints and
complimentary projects.  Come off it - you haven't been &quot;oppressed&quot;.  We
MODERATE those who are on the verge of starting flame wars, as most
moderators do.  That's why moderators exist.

Btw, you still haven't addressed my initial point.

You were never banned, you were moderated, there *IS* a difference and
by calling Norbert a liar you have stepped over the line.
