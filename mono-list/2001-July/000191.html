<PRE>bored enough to try and answer some of these questions...

&gt;<i> 1. Why should we direct such considerable resources to such a marginal and 
</I>&gt;<i> risky project? Aren't these precious resources better directed elsewhere?
</I>
Because it is 
* interesting (lots of fun technology)
* important (we do want to stop MS monopoly)
* standardized (ECMA)
and most importantly,
* useful (even if all compatibility fails, we will still have a cool 
  platform)

&gt;<i> 2. Can't MS thwart Mono by creating technical or intellectual property 
</I>&gt;<i> roadblocks?
</I>
No, nothing can stop Mono from doing what it currently aspires to do
(CLR, C# compiler, class library)

&gt;<i> 3. Don't existing open source projects offer capabilities equivalent to 
</I>&gt;<i> .Net? Can't we use them instead of mono?
</I> 
No.  Similary maybe (which, though? java hardly even qualifies), but
definately not equivalent.

&gt;<i> 5. Why are RedHat, IBM and others refusing to directly support Mono with
</I>&gt;<i> funding and public commitments? What do they know but won't say?
</I>
Ask RedHat, IBM and others.

&gt;<i> 7. MS is releasing shared source on FreeBSD. Isn't it better to convert to 
</I>&gt;<i> FreeBSD rather than fight the .Net battle? Isn't the gain in open vs. shared 
</I>&gt;<i> source too small for such a major effort?
</I>
Absolutely not.  <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/</A>

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 8. Isn't Mono a foil in negotiating .Net licensing for Linux? Won't mono 
</I>&gt;<i> project be dropped if .Net for Linux is licensed?
</I>
No, unless another free software implementation of the .NET
development framework comes along, Mono will live on.  (that's my guess..)

&gt;<i> 11. Is the real purpose of Mono to counterpunch MS?
</I>&gt;<i> 12. Isn't Mono important only because .Net will be popular?
</I>
Dude, look at <A HREF="http://www.ximian.com/mono/faq.html,">http://www.ximian.com/mono/faq.html,</A> question 9.
Don't suggest new FAQs that are already answered in the FAQ just
because you don't believe the answer.

&gt;<i> 13. Is MS trying to bash Linux by offering .Net on BSD? Isn't it a divide 
</I>&gt;<i> and conquer gambit? Is it really about licensing terms?
</I>
Ask MS.

&gt;<i> 14. Do we really know if .Net achieves an acceptable performance level?
</I>
pretty much yeah.

&gt;<i> 15. Isn't Sun's controlling attitude responsible for MS need for .Net?
</I>
Partially, yes, I guess...  but what does this has to do with Mono???
 
&gt;<i> 16. If Mono succeeds, who are the winners and losers?
</I>
We will all be winners.

&gt;<i> 17. This is a MS play. They'll win no matter what.
</I>
That's not a question.

&gt;<i> 19. Isn't .Net vaporware?
</I>
What are you talking about?  .NET as the framework Mono is trying to
implement?  No, go look at the ECMA specs.  Microsofts implementation?
No, look at VS.NET beta 2.

&gt;<i> 20. If mono succeeds, won't MS quit sharing source?
</I>
1. Ask MS.
2. We don't care.  Shared Source is not free software.

Simon.
