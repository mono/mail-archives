<PRE>I've noticed links to a few research publications on the Ximian mono web 
pages.  Some of you may already be aware of this, but I think that it bears
saying anyway.  The fact that an algorithm or idea is published in a
peer-reviewed scientific publication DOES NOT mean that the algorithm or 
idea is unencumbered by patents.  The mono developers should be particularly 
careful when considering using ideas presented in research papers published 
by authors from industry.  It is often the case that industrial research labs 
require researchers to file patent applications before they are allowed to 
disclose their ideas in scientific publications.  Nowadays it is not that 
uncommon for university researchers to file for patents on their ideas 
before publishing them. 

This is not to say that you shouldn't incorporate ideas from the research
community into mono.  Just don't assume that those ideas are always going
to be &quot;free&quot; for you to use.

-Kevin
