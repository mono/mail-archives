Also, Microsoft helped fund some of the work on Kaffe.  That work brought
the Microsoft Java extensions to Kaffe, so that Visual J++ users would
always have a platform to run their code on, regardless of what happened
with the Java lawsuit.

Microsoft does not seem to have a problem with their customers running
non-GPLed bytecode on a GPLed VM.  In fact, they seem to be encouraging
it.
