<PRE>Would it be correct to say that Mono is not aiming to be an
implementation of the ECMA CLI, but rather Microsoft's .NET Framework?

I ask because the trend on this list seems to be towards replicating
.NET as a whole, not the ECMA CLI. While this is interesting and useful
in of itself, unfortunately it means that the Mono efforts aren't really
a validation of the completeness of the CLI specs. IMHO this is a pity,
since validating the specification through implementation is really
important if the development community is going to use the CLI as a
general-purpose computing platform longer-term. 

OTOH, this means that Microsoft's Shared Source implementation, when it
arrives, will fill a valuable niche (assuming it sticks to just what's
in the CLI). I'd like to see a non-MS implementation do the same thing,
though... :-)

If Mono wanted to fix this, I'm sure it could be done: this would
involve instituting coding guidelines like &quot;CLI types can only depend on
other CLI types&quot;, &quot;don't use method signatures that aren't in the CLI
from within CLI types&quot;, possibly some preprocessing to break out the
CLI-compliant &amp; non-CLI-compliant methods, etc. 

This would need someone from Ximian to take up the cause, though - if
not, it will just become a &quot;big ball of mud&quot;, with .NET and CLI types
inextricably linked. Is it worth the effort? Personally, I think so, but
admittedly my interests lie more in seeing a solid CLI implementation
that we can port *everywhere*, rather than purely a .NET clone on Linux.
Of course, the former does not preclude the latter, it's just a matter
of priorities.

Comments? Am I a community of 1 in my hopes for the CLI? :-)
