ok, cool.

that might be easier.  i'll look at it.

</I>
true, i hadn't discovered System.Array.Copy() when i wrote that part.

&gt;<i> - There are a couple of things in SyncStack that
</I>&gt;<i>   probably don't need to be locked.  For example:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   &gt;   public override int Count {
</I>&gt;<i>   &gt;     get { lock(this) { return count; } }
</I>&gt;<i>   &gt;   }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Locking here is unnecessary because reading from
</I>&gt;<i>   an int should be atomic. (It is in Java...)
</I>
I wasn't sure, so I was playing it safe.  In retrospect, I imagine you're
correct.

&gt;<i> - What happens if you do something like this:
</I>&gt;<i>   Stack s1 = new Stack();
</I>&gt;<i>   Stack s2 = Stack.Synchronized(s1);
</I>&gt;<i>   s1.push(1);
</I>&gt;<i>   s2.pop();
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Should s2 be able to pop the element that was pushed
</I>&gt;<i>   into s1?  I think the MS implementation supports   
</I>&gt;<i>   this.  (Guessing from playing with ArrayList.)
</I>
I'll play around and see if it works that way.  If so, your solution seems to
be the best way to handle it.

&gt;<i> - Here's one way to solve the above problem, if 
</I>&gt;<i>   indeed it is a problem.  Have SyncStack be a pure 
</I>&gt;<i>   wrapper class, that has one extra member, which is a
</I>&gt;<i>   Stack.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i>   All the methods are overridden to call the 
</I>&gt;<i>   same method on m_insideStack.  The member variables
</I>&gt;<i>   inherited from Stack are never used, which sucks,
</I>&gt;<i>   but I don't know how to get around that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Other than the fact that it solves the above
</I>&gt;<i> problem,
</I>&gt;<i>   it has the benefit that you don't need member
</I>&gt;<i>   variables for readonly and synchronized.  You can
</I>&gt;<i>   just have the base class return false for both, then
</I>&gt;<i>   have the wrappers override it to return true.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   SyncRoot, then would return
</I>&gt;<i> m_insideStack.SyncRoot().
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hope these comments are helpful,
</I>
Very much so.  Thanks.  An updated version will be available soon.
