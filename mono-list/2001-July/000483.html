<PRE>&gt;<i> please explain why we aint cooperatign more with portable.net?
</I>&gt;<i> it seems a little bit silly. (though nothing would prohibit
</I>&gt;<i> portable.net to just &quot;inject&quot; things into mono)
</I>
It depends on what Portable.NET tries to be.  

Our goal is very clear:

	  We are trying to make a better platform for developing
          applications for Unix.

We have chosen the .NET development platform as the vehicle for this.
Being a very long time C code, and having witnessed how C# and .NET
actually improved my efficiency compared to the traditional C +
framework development, we want to write as much code as possible in C#
and the .NET class libraries.

That means for example that our metadata library is only a tiny
implementation designed for only reading assemblies.  Any kind of
higher level support should be implemented in C#.  

The JIT engine will be in C, because I can not think of any other way
of doing it with C#.  If I had a chance, I would do it in C#, believe
me.  But the less C, the better. 

Miguel.
