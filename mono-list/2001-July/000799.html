<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>there was some talk yesterday about coding standards for c#... i'd like to 
add one. if a class has attributes, make sure they're protected - not private 
(you never know whose going to subclass you), and not public (thats what 
accessors are for).

for example, i was throwing together a SocketException class and found that 
the Exception class defined the source as a private attribute. can't use it 
without the accessor.

also, miguel, if you want, i can send you some more skeleton classes for the 
System.Net.Sockets namespace. its mostly enums, but there's some real classes 
there. just none with alot of functionality.

which brings me to my question: how would i call out to the system sockets 
interface from within a socket class? or for that matter bind, listen and 
connect?

thanks,
Andrew Sutton
