Kaffe is GPLed, and AFAIK it hasn't contaminated anything yet.

This is not a solution at all. AFAIK, if there is a US pantent on
something, then to distribute anything covered by the patent in the US you
need a license. Unless the *entire* Mono project, including all mirrors,
moves offshore, you would need a license to the patents.
