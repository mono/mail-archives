<PRE>You may not realize that LGPL'd code is difficult or impossible to use
for embedded systems, due to the requirement for being able to re-link
the application.  Therefore Cygnus has never shipped LGPL'd &quot;target&quot;
libraries (code that gets linked with the application so it can run
on the target).  These libraries, which include libgcc, libstdc++,
libgcj, and &quot;newlib&quot; (an ansi C library for embedded system) have
used what we call the libgcc copyright, which is GPL with exception:

    As a special exception, if you link this library with other files
    to produce an executable, this library does not by itself cause
    the resulting executable to be covered by the GNU General Public
    License.  This exception does not however invalidate any other
    reasons why the executable file might be covered by the GNU
    General Public License.

Of course any code that depends on Gnome might as well be LGPL.
However, you might want to consider a libgcc-style license
for &quot;core&quot; (non-GUI) classes.  But of course it is up to you.
(Stallman has mixed feelings about both LGPL and the libgcc-license.)
