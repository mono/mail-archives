If I'm understanding this correctly, your proposal is to say
&quot;don't use this type here, use the other one over there&quot;,
where &quot;the other one over there&quot; is in a system-specific
namespace and/or assembly.  The VM would substitute
the type behind the scenes when the assembly is loaded.

This way, there would be one main &quot;corlib.dll&quot; that had
the primary definitions in it, and then each system would
have its own &quot;native.dll&quot; that re-defined the types to
what the local system required.

This &quot;native.dll&quot; could be generated automatically using
some autoconf magic when the VM is built for a given
system, and would probably be quite small.  Also, the
VM itself doesn't need to know about &quot;int_t&quot;, &quot;off_t&quot;,
&quot;stat_t&quot;, etc, because all the knowledge is encoded into
&quot;native.dll&quot;, which is much easier to update.

Am I understanding this correctly?

Cheers,

Rhys.
