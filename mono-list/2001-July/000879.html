<PRE>Hey guys!

   This week I am going to the Open Source conference in San Diego,
and later to the Ottawa Linux Symposium in Ottawa.  I will still be
actively involved in Mono during this time.

   Dietmar and Paolo are both coming back from vacations on monday, so
they will do the core of the hacking together with Dick this week, as
I enjoy the weather in San Diego.

   If you are going to those conferences and want to talk about Mono,
find me, I am going to be the guy wearing a red clown nose. 

   A new release of the class libraries is out, for hacking purposes. 

Here are the new bits:

* New and Fresh

	* System.Web.Caching from Patrick (Cache, CacheItemProperty,
	  CacheDependency, CacheEntry, CacheExpires, ExpiresBucket). 

	* Michael Lambert provided a bunch of new enumerations from
	  the ECMA specs. 

* Bootstraing our runtime

   I wrote a bunch of core classes to get a complete mscorlib.dll
replacement that we can use to test the engine.  They are seriously
incomplete, and they are missing serious parts of code, which is a
problem.  If someone wants to work on those, I would really appreciate
it.

   I am currently working on the instance creation framework for Mono, and will be stuck doing that for a couple of days before I can work again on the core libs.

   Those classes I will label as `Classes in need of Love'.

* Updated

	* System.Char got ToLower and ToUpper from Jeffrey.  These are
	  not Unicode aware, but just a quick hack to get
	  System.String to go.

	* corlib/System.Net moved to System/System.Net (sorry about
	  that)

	* System.XML/* moved to System.XML/System.XML (sorry about
	  that as well ;-)

* Classes and pieces in Need of Love. 

	* Test suite for our System.String, and some excercisers for
	  it.

	* System.Char: complete, there is a lot to be done there. 

	* Bootstraping purposes: Attribute, Delegate,
	  MulticastDelegate, Enum, Type, ParamArrayAttribute.

	* System.DateTime.

	* Implementing integer Parsing and integer rendering so we can
	  implement all the Parse and ToString things in SByte, Byte,
	  Int*.

	* System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationInfo: Another
	  class implemented to bootstrap which is far from finished.

* Incomplete

	Andrew Sutton provided some skeletons and some functions for
	System.Net.Sockets.  We are going to need some help from the
	guys on the to help him get his code tested and debugged.


* Availability

	As usual, the code is available from
	<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/download.html">http://www.go-mono.com/download.html</A> 

Best wishes!
Miguel.
