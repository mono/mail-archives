As an Apache member, I can tell you that what you describe would likely be
very welcome there.

Unfortunately, as Chair of the Jakarta Project Management Committee, I can
tell you that it is not likely to find a home within Jakarta.  The mission
of Jakarta is focused specifically on Java.

A plan with much more chance of success would be to propose a project which
is a peer to, and parallels Jakarta.

Something that I would personally find immensely more satisfying - is to
actually find a way to host the actual Jakarta projects on top of the Mono
runtime.  And, for that matter, the xml.apache.org projects, such as
Cocoon.  ;-)
