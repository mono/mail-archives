<PRE>Bob Salita posted a few questions on the list, I have answered here,
and added them to our FAQ:

Here are the questions:

##
 &gt; Will Mono enable running of MS Office on Linux?  Otherwise its a
 &gt; waste.
 
 No, Mono is not a mechanism to run existing Windows applications on
 Linux.  Look at Wine for this kind of technology.
 
 I see Mono as an upgrade on the development platform, an exciting
 addition to the developer toolkit.  The goal of Mono is to bring this
 technology to non-Windows platforms (although we hope Mono will also
 run on Windows, for debugging and comparative purposes).
 
##
&gt;<i> Q: How can you expect Mono to compete with Microsoft, wont this
</I>&gt;<i>    require an effort too large?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A: You are right.  Mono will never become a reality without the help
</I>&gt;<i>    of other contributors.  Ximian is a small company that can not
</I>&gt;<i>    finish Mono alone.  We will be working with members of the
</I>&gt;<i>    community to deliver the product.
</I>
##
Q: What about Intel's research JIT framework, ORP?

A: At this time, we are investigating whether we can use elements of
   ORP for Mono.   ORP is a research JIT engine that has a clear
   defined API that splits the JIT from the GC system and the actual
   byte code implementation.   It is a research product.
