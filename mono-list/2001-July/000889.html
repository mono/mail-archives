<PRE>Mono List,


A subject I would like to see discussed is extending the class library 
that Microsoft has.

I can see arguments on both sides of this issue.

For extending : Microsoft's class library is very minimal in some 
area's.  The System.Security.Cryptography library feels really bare. 
 They do not even implement BlowFish.  Why should we not implement 
something just because Microsoft didn't?

Against extending : Even though different in spirit, this is in practice 
similar to activities that Microsoft has done before that annoy's all of 
us to death.  Even though it would be nice to have those classes, it 
would break compatibility.


Middle ground might be to say to implement these classes in a different 
namespace but that would be a hideous solution.

I imagine Miguel will have final say in this but discussion will 
hopefully give a decent solution.  Maybe one not listed here.  Apologies 
if already discussed but overlooked.


From,

Matthew S. Ford
