<PRE>Rhys,

&gt;<i> And which will no doubt be hard-wired to Mono API
</I>&gt;<i> and autoconf conventions, and hence useless to anyone
</I>&gt;<i> else who may be interested in running applications built
</I>&gt;<i> to work with the Mono C# library.  Hence, the rest of
</I>&gt;<i> us will have to start from scratch.
</I>
As I said in an earlier message, I am willing to accomodate the needs
of other CLI runtime implementations (it is on a separate thread).

Now, even if we took radically different approaches (PInvoke
annotations vs generated support libraries), the changes are going to
be isolated in one, maybe two &quot;private&quot; classes at most.  

No matter what direction we take with the Mono class libraries, in the
worst possible case, you would have to write a single class that would
work for Portable.NET.

And my offer is to have those changes integrated directly into the
class distribution of Mono.  Hey, I can even give you CVS access to
the tree to make those changes yourself and make sure the makefiles
can work with both setups.

&gt;<i> The proposal to use type diversion, where &quot;stat&quot; can be
</I>&gt;<i> diverted to a &quot;NativeStat&quot; in a platform-specific assembly
</I>&gt;<i> is much better than this.  The platform-specific parts are
</I>&gt;<i> completely in a C#-based &quot;native.dll&quot; which is portable
</I>&gt;<i> from one VM to another.  Any approach that uses C to
</I>&gt;<i> make the glue will bind the C# library to one VM only.
</I>
The problem is -As Ferguson- pointed out that this is just a lot of
bloat for the runtime when there is a simpler solution available.

What if Mono has mononat.dll and you have portnat.dll?  Big deal, a
tiny library that does not really make a difference.

Miguel.
