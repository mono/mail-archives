<PRE>&gt;<i> it seems quite obvious that GPL propagation is not feasible for mono, as it
</I>&gt;<i> would contaminate software being run on top of it. We have to find a non
</I>&gt;<i> propagating open source license, which would be by the way ok with
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft.

Yes, all the .NET classes should be LGPL. That's what it's for- exactly these 
sorts of cases. BTW, I suspect if you consider using a non-GPL compatible 
license, you would find FSF support withdrawn quicker than you can say 
&quot;Mozilla Public License&quot;, and that would be bad.

We could use an Apache-style license, i.e. create a Mono foundation, and that 
would license all the software under an ultra-permissive BSD license, but 
personally I find the BSD license dangerous.
