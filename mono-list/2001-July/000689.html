Basically, just pick some class that nobody has started work on (check the
class status pages to be sure), email the list to let people know you're
working on it, and impliment it.

Alternatively, there are many classes that lack nunit test cases, so you could
contribute by writing some.  You can get nunit at nunit.sourceforge.net.

Good Luck,
