<PRE>I know someone else had mentioned that they were working on some of the
System.Collections classes (specifically Hashtable), but has anyone started on
Stack yet?  I've got one that I wrote while teaching myself C#, and since it
doesn't appear to be implimented in the current version of the code, I'm
willing to clean it up and submit it.

By the way, I see that the ArrayList implimentation is incomplete.
Specifically, it doesn't include the wrapper to impliment a Synchronized
version.  I also have to do this for Stack.  Would it be ok to submit a
version with this portion stubbed out, since I could definately get that done
tomorrow some time, or should I wait until I have time to complete the entire
thing?
