<PRE>I've been investigating PInvoke support for Portable.NET,
and I've come across some icky issues that will probably
affect Mono's VM as well.

In particular, because &quot;int&quot; and &quot;long&quot; have different types
on different CPU's, it is difficult to write PInvoke declarations
in C# that will work with all Unix libc's.  The result would
be libraries and applications that need to be compiled
separately for 32-bit and 64-bit systems.

To avoid duplication of effort, I propose we come up with a
common way of solving these problems.  Towards that end,
I have placed the following document on my Web site that
describes how I think this can be resolved:

Comments are welcome.

Cheers,

Rhys.

P.S. Thanks to the person who mentioned &quot;libffi&quot; as a way
of doing PInvoke.  That is a very nice library.
