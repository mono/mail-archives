<PRE>&gt;<i> I dont speak for everyone, but I'd love to see a vb compiler for mono.
</I>&gt;<i> There is a tun of vb programmers/code out there that could be harnased
</I>&gt;<i> for gnome programming if vb was available. You wouldnt need to know
</I>&gt;<i> asembly to do it. The C# compiler is writen in C#.

Highly unlikely. VB is not .NET compatible.

VB.NET is, however. It is also a *very* different language to VB. However, 
VB.NET isn't an open standard, so there is no scope there.
