<PRE>&gt;<i> It would be useful, certainly, but AFAIK, there's no System.Enum implemented
</I>&gt;<i> yet, which kinda makes them useless for now...
</I>&gt;<i>  (I have several other enums implemented, but have been reluctant to put
</I>&gt;<i> them into the tree before we have a real Enum class to use a base class).
</I>
This does not really matter.  For example, people can work on other
parts of the system (Ie, even ADO) without needing all the foundation
to be there.  Since we are using the existing Microsoft compiler, we
can test against their class libraries.

So feel free to work on things, even if we have no &quot;backing&quot;
implementation for them.

&gt;<i> I've looked into the Enum class, and it is actually much larger than it
</I>&gt;<i> looks at first sight. Problem is that, like many other of the basic classes,
</I>&gt;<i> it has heavy dependencies on Reflection and System.Type, as well as on
</I>&gt;<i> internalcall methods for boxing...
</I>
Yeah, do not worry about those for now.  Just go and implement higher
level stuff ;-)
