<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why do you suppose there isn't a C compiler for JVM?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Actually, I think it's because there is little demand
</I>&gt;<i>for it.  People are switching away from C/C++ to Java
</I>&gt;<i>because those languages are a management and
</I>&gt;<i>maintenance headache in commercial software
</I>&gt;<i>development.
</I>
You raise several interesting issues here. I'll highlight them
but leave the debate to others.

1. Does JVM not have a C compiler because of the lack of commercial and 
intellectual interest, or is it technically too problematic to create a 
conforming ANSI C compiler?

2. People are switching away from C/C++ to Java.

3. Java is less of a management or maintenance headache than C/C++ in a 
commercial software development.

4. It is worthwhile to switch from C/C++ to Java because C/C++ is a 
management and maintenance headache in commercial software development.

5. Will .Net stop or reverse the switch from C/C++ (or VB) to Java.

&gt;<i> &gt; Unless C and C++ can be implemented under JVM,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there's no way JVM will be considered as an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; alternative VM to CLR.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think this is a non-issue.
</I>
6. Is the implementation of C/C++ requred for a commercially successful VM?

&gt;<i>Second, since Mono is embarking on implementing a new
</I>&gt;<i>runtime anyway, nothing stops us from extending the
</I>&gt;<i>JVM with bytecodes to handle byte-compiled C/C++.
</I>
7. Is it better to extend the JVM to nicely handle C/C++ or other languages, 
rather than go with .Net approach. What are the technical merits, what are 
the marketplace considerations?

All nice issues.

Bob.
