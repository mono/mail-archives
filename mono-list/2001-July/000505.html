<PRE>Miguel,

using ILDASM is a requirement in implementing the web classes, as some
namespaces are not even present in the documentation
(System.Web.Compilation...).

The goal here is to use the Metadata of each class to generate the class
layout, and do the implementation by hand. The self description of a class
is a feature of the language, and using this metadata is not the same thing
as getting the MSIL to write the code for you...

    &gt; Miguel, using ILDASM is a must have when you have a lot of class
    &gt; with very few documentation as it's the case with the webform
    &gt; part (which class call what, when and why).

It is not a requirement.  You can look at the various classes, and
think about their relationships.

If you look at the ILDASM code, you might taint yourself, and your
code.  I rather have you spend more time understanding the classes
than using the quick approach of disassembling proprietary code and
implementing someone else's abstractions.

Please, be really careful here.

    &gt; If there's documentation, then it's great, but for implementing
    &gt; all the propreties, methods and fields of a class, without IL
    &gt; DASM, i don't want to rely on falty and incomplete
    &gt; documentation.

Do not worry about this.  Begin with a few things, and if you can not
figure out something, post to the list, and get input from other
people.  It is not such a big deal.

Also, if we can not figure something out, we can always wait for .NET
to fully ship to implement those, and look at those bits in the
documnetation.

    &gt; Moreover, the Microsoft articles themselves say to use ILDASM to
    &gt; see what's behind the class library...

Lets play safe.  There is really no need to use ildasm on proprietary
code.  Use ildasm on your own code if you want

Miguel.
