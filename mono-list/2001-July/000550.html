<PRE>&gt;<i> First, there is a lot of marketing hype surrounding
</I>&gt;<i> C#/.NET. Microsoft claims that it &quot;runs C++&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> that its runtime is &quot;common&quot;, and that it is
</I>&gt;<i> intrinsically much more efficient. I find those
</I>&gt;<i> claims dubious, but haven't made up my mind yet.
</I>&gt;<i> There are some differences between the JVM and the
</I>&gt;<i> CLR, but they are pretty localized.
</I>
There is a lot of hype about both the Java platform and the .NET/CLR
platforms ;-)
C++ does run on .NET (limited to single inheritance?) and the runtime is
common to all languages on the platform (that is what &quot;common&quot; means in
MS-speak). I am not sure about the claims for efficiency although IL
bytecode are optimised for compilation as opposed to interpretation.

&gt;<i> Second, Mono will not be able to deliver a
</I>&gt;<i> C#/.NET implementation tomorrow. I
</I>&gt;<i> think Mono would be lucky to deliver something
</I>&gt;<i> that's merely limping along within a year: writing
</I>&gt;<i> garbage collectors, compiling efficient method
</I>&gt;<i> dispatch, and dealing with dynamic code generation
</I>&gt;<i> is tricky. Look at some open source systems that
</I>&gt;<i> do it: CMU CommonLisp, any of the free JVM JITs,
</I>&gt;<i> SML/NJ, etc. That's the kind of system C#/CLR/.NET is.
</I>&gt;<i> That's the kind of system people participating
</I>&gt;<i> in Mono need to be able to understand top-to-bottom.
</I>
Definitely.

&gt;<i> Third, the best starting point for a C#/CLR/.NET
</I>&gt;<i> implementation may be one of the Java compilers and
</I>&gt;<i> runtimes. That's clearly how Microsoft developed
</I>&gt;<i> C#/CLR.
</I>
MS bought OmniVM which was already &quot;multi-lingual&quot;. Having access to Java IP
certainly made it possible to avoid the same mistakes and/or improve on how
things are done in Java. In any case MS's VM was the fastest JVM period.
Hopefully they have improved on that in .NET
