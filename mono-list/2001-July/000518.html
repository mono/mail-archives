<PRE>&gt;<i>Sessions's research can only be described as shoddy,
</I>&gt;<i>since he missed several major, mature, and widely used
</I>&gt;<i>languages with JVM backends.
</I>
Roger is quite willing to publish counterpoints. He
often does that. You've got a good start, fill in some
details and send him an email.

Which major, mature and widely used languages
are these? Is the implementation major, mature
and widely used, or just the language?

Roger's point is that there is much talk about the
JVM supporting many languages but nearly zero major,
mature and widely used languages.

If the JVM now supported legacy C, C++ and VB, many of
us would head down your way. If you can provide that,
its not to late for us change horses.

Bob.
