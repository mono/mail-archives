<PRE>here are my worries about the LGPL license. If anyone can show me there's no
problems, I'll be very happy to use the LGPL license for mono:

------
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a
&quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a work containing
portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your
choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the
customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.
------

That means that a software running on top of mono should include in it's
license a grant for the users of the application to be able to modify the
application, reverse engineering it. That  means that most closed-source
programs which will run on top of the .net framework could &quot;technically&quot; run
on top of mono, but won't &quot;legally&quot; ?

------
For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;
must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the
executable from it.
------

That means publishing the source code of the application and the compilers,
right?


My main problem with the LGPL license is that it only allow the application
ran on top of mono not to be modified for distribution, but it seems to me
it still requires to publish source code and such? Which will be a conflict
for applications which weren't linked &quot;specifically&quot; to the mono library,
but just built on top of the framework.
