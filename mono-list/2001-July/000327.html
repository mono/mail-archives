<PRE>Hi there,

	I am not completely familiar in what ways VB.NET is so radically
different from VB 6.0 but I am quite sure, as an author of gb, that the
task is not as monumental as it seems :)

	Rewriting from scratch might be warranted but I wouldn't worry
about it so much :-)

	Could somebody please point me to docs on VB.NET ? Time to start
digging into it I guess.


	Regards,

		Ravi
