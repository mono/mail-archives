Just to throw my opinion in, I would personally prefer to see the libraries
licensed as LGPL.  It seems to me that it would drastically improve the
chances of comercial projects using them, where as if they are GPL'd, even
with an embedded exception, it might push many people to use the MS 'not
really free' implimentation on FreeBSD if they want a C# implimentation on
UNIX.

Personally, I do want to have a C# implimentation on UNIX, and I would prefer
to use mono, but if it's class libraries are GPL'd, that could put a big
damper on things at work.
