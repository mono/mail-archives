<PRE>Hi all,

I just downloaded and finally successfully built the Mono and MCS stuff.  It
wasn't that easy for me since my *NIX skills are a bit rusty.  However, I
wanted to point out a couple of things for the people working on this to
maybe fix/enhance/document.

1) I installed Win2K on my E: drive.  The makefiles assumes the csc.exe is
in //c/winnt/microsoft.net/framework/v1.0.2914/csc.exe.  Is there a way to
use the SYSTEMROOT environment variable in the makefile? Moreover, will the
compiler always be in in SYSTEMROOT?

2) glib wouldn't build because of the &quot;extern char *strsignal()...&quot; in
g_strsignal() in gstrfuncs.c.  I read the threads here to help figure this
one out, and took the approach of commenting out the offending two lines.  I
think that configure is defining HAVE_STRSIGNAL when it shouldn't, but I'm
not sure where to look for that (yet :).

3) Even thought glib was installed, when I tried to make mono, it told me
that it didn't know where glib-config was.  This was confusing because this
file was in the glib-1.2.10 directory that I unzipped.  What wasn't obvious
was that it should be using the one that was placed in c:\mono\bin.  I added
that directory to my PATH and all was well, but for a relative newbie this
would probably be a total stumper.

That's all for now.  If this kind of information is useful, please let me
know and I'll continue to report what I find.  If it's just noise, let me
know too and I'll refrain.

HTH,
Nick Drochak
