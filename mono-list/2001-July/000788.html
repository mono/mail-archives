At the present time, that seems unlikely to me, but I really don't want to
speculate too much in this area.  Progress is likely to be made first in
those areas (if any) where there is a common interest in standardizing.

&gt;<i> &gt; A final thought - if you look at JDK documentation, you will see

&gt;<i> &gt; would be extremely valuable is a proposal for a standard set of

&gt;<i> &gt; which enables the one to determine what profile a given method belongs

&gt;<i> &gt; and what version of that profile.  This would enable compilers to
</I>provide
&gt;<i> &gt; warnings (e.g., this code contains references to floating point - and
</I>may
&gt;<i> &gt; not run on compact devices).  Such a proposal would have to be
</I>cognizant of
&gt;<i> &gt; the potential footprint and runtime overhead associated with such
</I>metadata.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 100% Agreed - I like this idea *a lot* (I presume you meant library, not
</I>&gt;<i> profile, correct?). Additionally, it seems that you'd need to go beyond
</I>&gt;<i> just methods and also attribute types, interfaces, the 'throws list',
</I>&gt;<i> etc. with this information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Were you thinking of using CAs, or rather direct metadata
</I>&gt;<i> representation? I don't see anything in partition IV that precludes
</I>&gt;<i> implementing this as custom attributes, though it does state &quot;...there
</I>&gt;<i> need not be any direct support for Libraries and Profiles in the VES;
</I>&gt;<i> they are not represented in the metadata&quot;. Implementing this with CAs
</I>&gt;<i> seems consistent with the way CLS compliance is asserted using CAs.
</I>
My first thoughts were custom attributes, with some sort of &quot;inheriting&quot;
rules such as those for CLS compliance to minimize the amount of data
required to represent this information.

Other suggestions include a separate file, perhaps in XML.  Somehow that
doesn't appeal to me as much.

P.S.  There is no 'throws list' in the CLI.  You must be thinking of
another runtime.  ;-)
