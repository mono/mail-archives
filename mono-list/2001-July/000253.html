<PRE>Well, the standard C functions are portable enough to any C supporting
platform (alot more platforms then C# at the moment) and the C standard
math lib is alot better tested as well. So, it should be just as portable.
The question is, Do we want the class libs we are writing to be able to
run outside of mono, so that they run on Microsofts .NET (they already
have those libs, so it seems alittle silly) and other .NETalikes? If we
do, then we shouldnt bind anything and use pure C#.
