<PRE>&gt;<i> The fact that you can decode *some* bytecodes into 
</I>&gt;<i> source code does not mean that you can decode 
</I>&gt;<i> correctly *all* bytecodes that the JVM can
</I>interpret.

The JVM does not &quot;interpret&quot; arbitrary bytecode 
sequences.  The JVM imposes strong constraints on what

bytecode sequences are valid. These restrictions have 
been part of the JVM since the first public release,
AFAIK.

&gt;<i> The generic example I have used it (mix of C and
</I>&gt;<i> bytecodes):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	while (n &gt; 0){
</I>&gt;<i> 		ipush (n % 10)
</I>&gt;<i> 		n /= 10;
</I>&gt;<i> 		c++;
</I>&gt;<i> 	}
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	while (c--){
</I>&gt;<i> 		ipop 
</I>&gt;<i> 		print 
</I>&gt;<i> 	}
</I>
That code cannot be expressed as a legal JVM bytecode
sequence.

To avoid such misconceptions, I recommend reading 
Meyer's book on the JVM; there is more information at:

    <A HREF="http://mrl.nyu.edu/~meyer/jvm/">http://mrl.nyu.edu/~meyer/jvm/</A>

Meyer actually provides a JVM assembler, and he
gives your example as one of the examples that
is not legal (you can download the assembler and
the samples from his site).

&gt;<i> and the list of restrictions that CIL imposes on
</I>&gt;<i> the bytecodes.
</I>
These restrictions don't sound any different from what
the JVM imposes and documents.  In fact, I suspect
that
Microsoft based their VM on the Java VM and simply 
adopted the restrictions that the JVM already imposes.

&gt;<i> &gt; any safe CLR implementation) needs anyway (and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that is pretty trivial to implement).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It might look trivial to implement, but so far, it
</I>&gt;<i> does not seem like
</I>&gt;<i> anyone has written a Java code generator along those
</I>&gt;<i> lines.
</I>
Of course: lots of people have.  That's part of byte 
code verification, a part of any standard
JVM. The CLR needs the same functionality for the same

reasons: it can't trust the declarations that come 
along with the bytecode.

Furthermore, anything that translates stack oriented
byte code into register code has to perform this
kind of analysis anyway.

&gt;<i> The answer is trivial once you read the BURS
</I>&gt;<i> research papers (the web site has the links)
</I>
I couldn't find any links, and I'm not sure what
&quot;the web site&quot; is.  Could you give an actual
URL, please?  I'd be curious to see where these
claims originate.

Tom.
