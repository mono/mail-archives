<PRE>Yes, it has but it also has gains that the unmanaged code doesn't like
GC. I missunderstod the discussion because I that he was asking a
question about the possibilities not the overhead. He should not be
dubious because there is a common type system, and it runns C++ etc,
etc.

And regarding the MC++ gain or lost, it depends on what kind of C/C++
code you run. I had a discussion with Ronald L on the VC++ Compiler team
about this and really, in some cases you gain performance running under
managed code. The most common case is that you will lose 2-7% with
managed code.

&gt;<i>Still, you can compile managed c++ code and avoid the overhead.
</I>
Not correct. Managed code always has additional overhead over unmanaged
code -- compiled or not.

&gt;<i> &gt;First, there is a lot of marketing hype surrounding
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;C#/.NET. Microsoft claims that it &quot;runs C++&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;that its runtime is &quot;common&quot;, and that it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;intrinsically much more efficient. I find those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;claims dubious, but haven't made up my mind yet.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;There are some differences between the JVM and the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;CLR, but they are pretty localized.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Check your sources. You should be dubious.
</I>&gt;<i>Microsoft has made it clear that there is additional
</I>&gt;<i>overhead for running managed code vs. unmanaged code.
</I>&gt;<i>They hope it will be only a few percent difference.
