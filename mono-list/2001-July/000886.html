<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Sun has two JITs, one that generates slow code and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one that generates fast code.  You need to use the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;-server&quot; flag to get the fast one.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My Sun JVM rejects the &quot;-server&quot; flag.
</I>
Then you should upgrade--it's out of date.

&gt;<i> PS	My version of the C# port of convj performs at
</I>&gt;<i> least 20% better than the version you supplied. 
</I>
Other than the variable names, I can't see any
difference between the two versions.  Can you point
to where they are different?

BTW, what I posted isn't &quot;representative benchmarks&quot;,
it's two microbenchmarks.  All they tell me is
that a JVM isn't uniformly bad compared to a CLR;
To get an overall idea of a reasonably broad range of 
performance parameters, someone would need to port, 
say, the Gabriel benchmarks. 

So, overall, I wouldn't get hung up on these 
particular two microbenchmarks.

Tom.
