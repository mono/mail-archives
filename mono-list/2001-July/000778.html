You might find it productive to spend a few minutes reading the first three
pages of Partition IV.
(<A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/net/ecma/Partition_IV_Library.pdf">http://msdn.microsoft.com/net/ecma/Partition_IV_Library.pdf</A>).  In short,
the CLI contains a number of profiles, and a conforming implementation need
not implement all of them (for example: a PDA may not have floating point).
Adding a profile can involve adding methods to an preexisting class.

Another thing to contemplate - what is being standardized at this time in
ECMA TC39 represents our best guess on what is a reasonable core.  Only
real life experience will validate how well we do.  An independent
implementation (or three!) would provide either a extremely valuable
validation of this, or extremely valuable input as to what should be added
in the next cycle.

A final thought - if you look at JDK documentation, you will see
annotations such as &quot;introduced in JDK 1.2&quot;.  One thing that (IMHO) opinion
would be extremely valuable is a proposal for a standard set of metadata
which enables the one to determine what profile a given method belongs to,
and what version of that profile.  This would enable compilers to provide
warnings (e.g., this code contains references to floating point - and may
not run on compact devices).  Such a proposal would have to be cognizant of
the potential footprint and runtime overhead associated with such metadata.
