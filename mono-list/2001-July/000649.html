It isn't.  Basically, from a technical standpoint, every free Java
implementation sucks.  The bytecode formats in the JVM and in CIL/CLR
are very similar designs - they are both essentially linearized
versions of parse trees.

Good luck, you will need it.  Making an optimizing JIT work correctly
and efficiently in the presence of threads and garbage collection is
going to be difficult.

For the garbage collector, you may find this paper relevant:

For synchronization, this paper may be relevant:
