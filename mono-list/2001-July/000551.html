Of these, only JPython classifies as major, mature and widely used as far as
soundings in the community goes. There is also a commercial SmallTalk that
I've come across a lot.

&gt;<i> AspectJ is a Java extension that

</I>&gt;<i> is no equivalent in the C# world).
</I>
Aspect-oriented programming can be supported trivially with custom
attributes on the .NET platform.

&gt;<i> I also have my doubts that if CLR actually catches

</I>&gt;<i> in the long run.  Vague promises of C++ and VB
</I>&gt;<i> by Microsoft are a carrot to their developers to
</I>&gt;<i> make the switch more palatable, but I don't think
</I>&gt;<i> they are really meaningful.
</I>
I have no such doubts as all three languages serve very different audiences.
C++ (managed) - allows native and managed code to be developed in a single
language. For pure managed apps, C# (or VB) is a better choice
VB 		  - supports new and the millions of exisiting VB/VBA/VBScript/BASIC
developers
C#            - supports existing C/C++/Java developers and new C# recruits
(MS's answer to Java's advance in academia)
