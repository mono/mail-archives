    &gt; Miguel, using ILDASM is a must have when you have a lot of class
    &gt; with very few documentation as it's the case with the webform
    &gt; part (which class call what, when and why). 

It is not a requirement.  You can look at the various classes, and
think about their relationships.

If you look at the ILDASM code, you might taint yourself, and your
code.  I rather have you spend more time understanding the classes
than using the quick approach of disassembling proprietary code and
implementing someone else's abstractions.

Please, be really careful here. 

    &gt; If there's documentation, then it's great, but for implementing
    &gt; all the propreties, methods and fields of a class, without IL
    &gt; DASM, i don't want to rely on falty and incomplete
    &gt; documentation.

Do not worry about this.  Begin with a few things, and if you can not
figure out something, post to the list, and get input from other
people.  It is not such a big deal.

Also, if we can not figure something out, we can always wait for .NET
to fully ship to implement those, and look at those bits in the
documnetation.

    &gt; Moreover, the Microsoft articles themselves say to use ILDASM to
    &gt; see what's behind the class library...

Lets play safe.  There is really no need to use ildasm on proprietary
code.  Use ildasm on your own code if you want

Miguel.
