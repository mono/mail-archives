<PRE>Here are some questions gleamed from actual postings. Some are emotional, 
some are factual, some are difficult business questions. Convince us to help 
the Mono project by answering these questions:

Will Mono enable running of MS Office on Linux? Otherwise its a waste.

Don't existing OSS offer capabilities equivalent to .Net?

Why should we direct such considerable resources to such a marginal and 
risky project? Aren't these resources better directed elsewhere?

Isn't .Net vaporware?

Is the real purpose of Mono to counterpunch MS?

Isn't Mono important only because .Net will be popular?

Isn't Ximian already overburdened and underfunded? How can you compete with 
MS minions and billions?

I thought Ximian redefined itself as a service provider, not a developer? 
Didn't plan A already fail?

Can't MS thwart Mono by creating technical or IP roadblocks?

Is MS trying to bash Linux by offering .Net on BSD? Isn't it a divide and 
conquer gambit? Is it really about licensing terms?

Why are RedHat, IBM and others refusing to directly support Mono with 
funding and public commitments? What do they know but won't say?

Isn't Mono a foil in negotiating .Net licensing for Linux?

Won't Mono run afoul of intellectual property rights?

What are the alternatives to Mono?

MS is releasing shared source on FreeBSD. Isn't it better to convert to 
FreeBSD rather than fight the .Net battle? Isn't the gain in open vs. shared 
source too small for the major effort?

If Mono succeeds, who are the winners and losers?

What level of performance can be expected? What if Mono can't achieve that 
level of performance?

Do we really know if .Net achieves an acceptable performance level?

Isn't Sun's controlling attitude responsible for MS need for .Net?

I've read the reasons for Ximian'sneed for .Net. They seem really lame?

This is a MS play. They'll win no matter what.

What is ORP and why is it being considered for a VM?
