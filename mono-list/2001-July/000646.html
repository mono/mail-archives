I will change this for the next version of Stack I submit.  I already have a
fair number of changes from comments recieved yesterday.

&gt;<i> Also, I see no reason why synched collection should return synched

</I>
That's what it's doing (IIRC, I don't have source in front of me right now).
If you call GetEnumerator() on a SyncStack instance, it's returning an
Enumerator that is synchronized (on itself at the moment i think, but when I
change it to use a reference to the stack, it'll synchronize on the stack).

&gt;<i> Well, re-reading my explanation, I think it's quite unclear :-) Hence,

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I think, there ought to be the sort of &quot;skeleton&quot; for all collections

</I>
I think this will be less of a problem when there are more Collections classes
in the repository to use as a reference, but having a list of guidelines would
still be helpful.  At the very least we should be sure all the classes that
are there are consistent.
