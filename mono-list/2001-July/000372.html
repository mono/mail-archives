Gentle correction. Thank you.

&gt;<i> &gt; The benefits are obvious. Combinations of compiler and emitters still
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; produce traditional code. Nothing changes there. The compiler
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; becomes much simpler to write and the emitters are even simpler.
</I>
&gt;<i>Why would the compiler or emitters become simpler to write?
</I>
Reduction in complexity. Separation of tasks. Parallel effort.

&gt;<i>I don't see why they would change at all.  After all,
</I>&gt;<i>well-designed compilers already use this structure.
</I>
From my previous posting on mono:
Many compilers have a parser and emitter, only they are monolithic. I'm 
unaware of any compiler that (attempts to) meets the Open Compiler tests:

* The compiler creates a publicly exposed parse tree.
* The parse tree is designed to encourage new emitters.
* The parse tree is rich with information to support many types of emitters.
* The parse tree is designed for easy traversal.
* The parse tree is designed for emitters written by non-compiler experts.
* Emitters can easily be plugged in.
* New emitters are not encumbered with IP restrictions.

By these tests, gcc is not an Open Compiler. I welcome comments about these 
tests.

&gt;<i>Only the names would change: what you are calling
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;compiler&quot; and &quot;emitter&quot; are what is often called
</I>&gt;<i>the &quot;front-end&quot; and &quot;back-end&quot; of a compiler.
</I>
How people think of compilers would change. Expectations of the tasks a 
compiler could perform would change. How compiler writers structure the 
compiler would change. Adaptability of compilers would change. Marketing of 
compilers would change.

&gt;<i> &gt; First year programmers will be able to write emitters that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; effectively generate code for whole new architectures.
</I>
&gt;<i>You're kidding, right?
</I>
&gt;<i>There's a *lot* of work required to go between a parse tree and
</I>&gt;<i>efficient code for a complicated target such as x86 or IA64.
</I>
Right. That would be a poor choice of work for a first year student. 
Emitters can do many more tasks than generate assembler, as I and others 
have suggested on this list. It requires a shift in thinking.

Bob.
