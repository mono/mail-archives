If somebody didn't picked this up before I return from my vacation in
three weeks, I might have a look at it :-)

Just a thought on the calender: when the new millenium started on
January 1th, 2001, I wondered whether it was a coincidence that this day
was a Monday (which is, except in the US :-), the first day of the
week). I discovered (I apologize if this is a known fact) that a period
of 400 years has one very nice propertu: the number of leap years in
such a period is an exact multiple of 7. 400 years is exacly 20871
weeks!

If a date were stored according to this observation (e.g, store &quot;1984&quot;
as &quot;the 384th year of the 5th quadcentury&quot;), this would highly
simplifies date calculations involving leap years and the &quot;day of the
week&quot;. 1/1/1, the day our calendar started, was a monday, as were
1/1/401, 1/1/801, etc upto and including 1/1/2001. 

Of course, as Miguel said, we have to apply corrections from the current
Gregorian calender to earlier calenders (that differ per
country/region).
