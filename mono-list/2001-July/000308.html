	Gb is precisely what you are looking for :-) The basic core is
pretty robust and the parser should be complete with some more effort;
it's the GUI parts which are rather embryonic at the moment and are tied
to the corresponding GTK+ widgets.

	Indeed. Writing a VB.NET parser should be quite easy given the
specs ;-)

	Regards,
