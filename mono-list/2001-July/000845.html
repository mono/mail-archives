i'll implement the ones that i've started. that's pretty much the core socket 
stuff. i'm probably going to have to step on some of the System.Net code (and 
at least one place in the System code - private att should be protected 
maybe).

all that other tcp/ip stuff doesn't really belong there anyway. it should be 
in a tcp/ip namespace. in my opinion.

be warned though, i don't have any way to test the stuff i'm writing right 
now :) at least not until the compilers good to go.

</I>&gt;<i>        * We define our own constants, and we have a per-platform
</I>&gt;<i>           &quot;constant mapper&quot; built into the runtime (jit/interpreter).
</I>

another way to handle this would be to write a small portability library used 
by the dll that helps resolve system dependent issues. then the system stuff 
can call into the portability layer.

for example, part of the portability layer could be the mapping of 
System.Net.Sockets.AddressFamily values to system values.

actually, thats sort of an interesting way to solve complicated portability 
issues. define a set of shared libraries specifically designed to overcome 
portability issues. just distribute them with the jit. of course, this should 
only be used as a last resort.
