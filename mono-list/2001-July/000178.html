<PRE>[v2.0: Ordered list by relevance and significance per Miguels request. Bob]

Here are some questions gleamed from actual postings on other forums. They 
do not necessarily reflect my opinion. Some are provocative, some are 
emotional, some are technical, some are difficult business questions. 
Convince us to help the Mono project by answering these questions. I've 
listed the questions in order of importance:

1. Why should we direct such considerable resources to such a marginal and 
risky project? Aren't these precious resources better directed elsewhere?

2. Can't MS thwart Mono by creating technical or intellectual property 
roadblocks?

3. Don't existing open source projects offer capabilities equivalent to 
.Net? Can't we use them instead of mono?

4. What are the commercial alternatives to Mono?

5. Why are RedHat, IBM and others refusing to directly support Mono with
funding and public commitments? What do they know but won't say?

6. What level of performance can be expected? What if Mono can't achieve 
that level of performance?

7. MS is releasing shared source on FreeBSD. Isn't it better to convert to 
FreeBSD rather than fight the .Net battle? Isn't the gain in open vs. shared 
source too small for such a major effort?

8. Isn't Mono a foil in negotiating .Net licensing for Linux? Won't mono 
project be dropped if .Net for Linux is licensed?

9. Isn't Ximian already overburdened and under funded? How can you compete 
with MS minions and billions?

10. I thought Ximian redefined itself as a service provider, not a 
developer? Didn't plan A already fail?

11. Is the real purpose of Mono to counterpunch MS?

12. Isn't Mono important only because .Net will be popular?

13. Is MS trying to bash Linux by offering .Net on BSD? Isn't it a divide 
and conquer gambit? Is it really about licensing terms?

14. Do we really know if .Net achieves an acceptable performance level?

15. Isn't Sun's controlling attitude responsible for MS need for .Net?

16. If Mono succeeds, who are the winners and losers?

17. This is a MS play. They'll win no matter what.

18. What is ORP and why is it being considered for a VM?

19. Isn't .Net vaporware?

20. If mono succeeds, won't MS quit sharing source?
