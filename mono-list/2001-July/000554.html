Sounds good.  I'll spend some more time on it tonight and hopefully I'll be
able to send it in on monday.

Actually, I meant 'should I put stubs in Stack, or should I wait to submit
until after I impliment the thread safe wrapper?'  I can send in a stubbed out
version quickly, but I don't know how long it'll take me to do the thread safe
stuff, as I haven't done anything with the threading support in c# yet.

&gt;<i> We're trying to keep things that are just stubbed out from being put into

</I>
In that case, unless someone tells me otherwise, I'll try to get the thread
safe version working before submitting the code.

&gt;<i> If you have

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="mailto:vladimir@pobox.com">vladimir@pobox.com</A> to make sure he hasn't already started/finished it.
</I>
I assume you mean for ArrayList, since Vlad seems to be the person who wrote
it.  I'm planning on finishing up Stack and submitting it first, then if
nobody's finished ArrayList I'll probably tackle that next. If it's been done,
I'll find something else to hack on, as there appears to be plenty of 
w hangin fruit in System.Collections.
