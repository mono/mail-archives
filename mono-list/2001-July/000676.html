Agreed.  It's a messy area.  I haven't even begun thinking
about marshaling struct's by value yet.  Ick.

&gt;<i> Every DllImport call has to be thunked, right? So wouldn't you thunk int to
</I>&gt;<i> native int, long to native long?
</I>
The Windows version of PInvoke doesn't do this.  It always
thunks a numeric type to the same sized type, unless there is
an explicit override.  So, &quot;long&quot; maps to &quot;__int64&quot; under
Win32, not &quot;native long&quot;, which is only 32 bits.  I'm following
the same conventions here.

I also want to use roughly the same marshaling conventions
for PInvoke and InternalCall methods, to allow code reuse.
Because InternalCall methods deal with CLR types, &quot;long&quot;
needs to map to &quot;int64&quot;.

If there was a general consensus to do it your way, it could
be changed, but I'd like to get feedback from more people first.

&gt;<i> Also, the C compilers definition of int and long are all important, the OS
</I>&gt;<i> or hardware word size are indirect factors. Right?
</I>
The C compiler's definitions are typically based on what the
OS or hardware dictates.

The CLR uses specific word sizes (32-bits or 64-bits) for
its values.  It's version of &quot;int&quot; and &quot;long&quot; do not have to
match what the C compiler is using.

Cheers,

Rhys.
