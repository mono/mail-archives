<PRE>&gt;<i> -- Don't expect a fast CLR to be easier to

I have only access to kaffe and ORP as JITers, and I am surprised that
they are basically macro expanding JITer with a few optimizations
thrown in.  As I said, I thought this was a property of the byte codes
rather than a property of Kaffe.

That being said, what I am working on is to write a traditional
instruction selector for our JITer that should bring a lot of
performance, for about the same ammount of work.

Miguel.
