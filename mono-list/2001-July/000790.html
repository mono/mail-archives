<PRE>As it seems that PInvoke is one of the &quot;hot topics&quot;, I'll contribute with
-yet another- issue:

Libraries have different naming conventions on different systems. First,
they may simply have a different name (ie. libc vs. msvcrt). Second, each
operating system has its own rules for decorating dynamic libraries
(ie. &quot;lib&quot; before library name in most unixes, trailing &quot;.dll&quot; in windows,
trailing &quot;.so&quot; in linux/solaris).

When just dealing with libraries with the same name but different 
&quot;decoration&quot;, we could set a couple of rules such as:

.The DllImport clause receives the module name without any decoration: 
  ej: &quot;pthread&quot;
.On Linux systems, the name is converted to &quot;libpthread.so&quot;
.On AIX systems (just another sample), it would be something 
 like &quot;libpthread.sh&quot;
.On Windows systems, the resulting name would be &quot;pthread.dll&quot;

I'm not sure whether the MS implementation actually requires the &quot;.dll&quot; in 
the module name. If so, we can assume that library names always end with 
&quot;.dll&quot; and replace it using the proper convention for the current 
platform. This way we would still be .NET compatible while supporting
multiplatform-pinvoke. (yes, I know...it doesn't look &quot;great&quot;...)

We still have to deal with libraries that have completely different names
on different platforms. In that cases, we could use a custom attribute
that overrides the default library name for a given platform. That way,
the runtime would use the default library specified in the DllImport
declaration unless it finds the custom attribute that matches the
underlying platform.

Any comments?

Caster.
