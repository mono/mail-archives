I'm not completely familiar with the .net framework (yet!), but ...

Why would it fail. We write the loader, so we can check the signature and
make sure compatibility is ok. There might be a problem with importing
certificates with Microsoft's signature though.

You're not the first to suggest Java. The goal however is to implement
the CLI and do it from scratch :-) Inheriting some Java implementation
brings up a lot of unwanted issues .. license, code maintenance, etc.
