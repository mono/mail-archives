<PRE>Hi Michael,
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think anyone has picked up the following enums and I would like to
</I>&gt;<i> write them up.  Get them all done at once kind of thing.
</I>
It would be useful, certainly, but AFAIK, there's no System.Enum implemented
yet, which kinda makes them useless for now...
 (I have several other enums implemented, but have been reluctant to put
them into the tree before we have a real Enum class to use a base class).

I've looked into the Enum class, and it is actually much larger than it
looks at first sight. Problem is that, like many other of the basic classes,
it has heavy dependencies on Reflection and System.Type, as well as on
internalcall methods for boxing...
