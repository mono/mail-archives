There's an ad in the current (August) issue of VBPJ offering VB parser 
services (but not a product) and even in creating VB implementations on 
non-Windows platforms. To my knowledge, that's the only vendor in that type 
of biz.

&gt;<i>Something to point out is that I, myself, never really learned much about
</I>&gt;<i>grammars, and most of what I know are from crash courses of trying to write
</I>&gt;<i>a VB6 parser a few months ago that involved reading the beginning of a book
</I>&gt;<i>on ANTLR that explained what the limitations of LALR parsers (such as yacc
</I>&gt;<i>are) and why a predicated-LL(k) can parse more languages.  I might be very
</I>&gt;<i>wrong on some of my direct appraisals (such as Miguel's example, which I
</I>&gt;<i>feel would not work as it doesn't seem left recursive), and I hope no one
</I>&gt;<i>holds it that against me.
</I>
Me too. I've always assumed parsers were for people who don't write 
compilers ;-)

Bob.
