<PRE>(Paolo look at the end)

There are a number of people who are interested in contributing to the
class libraries in Mono.  

Here is how we can organize this work:

	1. Pick a class that you want to implement.  

	2. Post to the list `I am implementing XXX, and I estimate it
           will take YYY days' (please, try to have a good estimate).

	3. We will keep track of this (actually, we need a volunteer
           to keep track of this).

	4. If YYY days pass and we do not hear from you, we will
           &quot;release&quot; the class to other contributors and assume you
           got too busy to implement it.

	5. I will put up a web page with the &quot;ownerships&quot; of the
           various classes that are being worked on so people can
           track it

	6. If you finish your class, post it to the list, or mail me
           your implementation and I will put it up. 

(Paolo, do you think we can use a version of your script to keep track
of this?)

Miguel.
