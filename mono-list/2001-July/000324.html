	Well, there surely is extensive documentation on how VB.NET is
different from VB 6.0. MS doesn't plan on leaving all the million VB
developers just hanging, does it ? They need to be told how to port their
apps ;-)

	Although it isn't an open standard really, I am pretty sure we can
write a complete VB .NET parser :) It just takes effort which we surely
will put in !

	Regards,
