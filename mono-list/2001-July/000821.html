<PRE>&gt;<i> When did we tell you what to say or think?
</I>
Apologies, I don't really have a problem with you. I have a problem with 
Norbert Bollow and his unacceptable banning of me from the lists, because he 
disagrees with me.

What is moderation if not an attempt to control by banning what I can and 
can't say on dotGNU lists?

Bollow disagreed with me, and banned me from the list. This is a deliberate 
attempt to control what I can say.
