</I>
Great idea.  I suggest using GCC's &quot;tree&quot; data structure as the
&quot;information rich parsetree [sic]&quot;.  The advantage is that there are
already lots of &quot;compilers&quot; and &quot;emitters&quot; for it.

;-)

&gt;<i> The benefits are obvious. Combinations of compiler and emitters still

</I>&gt;<i> simpler to write and the emitters are even simpler.
</I>
Why would the compiler or emitters become simpler to write?
I don't see why they would change at all.  After all,
well-designed compilers already use this structure.
Only the names would change: what you are calling
&quot;compiler&quot; and &quot;emitter&quot; are what is often called
the &quot;front-end&quot; and &quot;back-end&quot; of a compiler.

&gt;<i> First year programmers 
</I>&gt;<i> will be able to write emitters that effectively generate code for whole new 
</I>&gt;<i> architectures.
</I>
You're kidding, right?

There's a *lot* of work required to go between a parse tree and
efficient code for a complicated target such as x86 or IA64.
