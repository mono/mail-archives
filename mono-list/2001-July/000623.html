 &gt; &gt; Forgive me if I missed this on the site, but how does someone go about

 &gt; &gt; Thanks for any guidance.  I would really like to help out.
 &gt; 
 &gt; At the moment, you pretty much have to develop on windows, as there is no c#
 &gt; compiler for UNIX available.
 &gt; 
 &gt; I'm just using the Microsoft Beta-2 .Net SDK.  It'll complain that your class
 &gt; is overriding one in the standard library, but you can solve that by either
 &gt; using a different namespace while you develop, or passing /nowarn:1595 on the
 &gt; command line for csc.exe.

Has anyone tried to run this under wine?  I'd like to try, but it
tries to load the entire (126 Mb) setup program into memory, which is
just a little larger than my virtual memory when X is running.  If no
one's tried, would someone mind sticking the command-line compiler
somewhere where I can d/l it, so I could try? (please don't e-mail it
to me :)

This is almost exactly the situation I had in mind when I kept a small
windows partition on an old hard disk I had laying around
... unfortunately it crashed :(
