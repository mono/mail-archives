</I>&gt;<i>         }
</I>&gt;<i>     }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is, client code should manually lock the entire loop to ensure the

</I>
ok, i see what you're saying, but when I change the enumerator and stack to
have a modification number, won't that take care of it.  if the stack is
modified, the enumerator will throw an exception, so the client won't need to
bother locking at all.  so the SyncEnumerator is completely unnecessary.

&gt;<i> &gt; At the very least we should be sure all the classes

</I>&gt;<i> Exactly! I also agree that it's probably too early to do something about it

</I>
Yeah. Once a few more Collections are in the repo, we should make sure they
are consistent, and then write up some guidelines.
