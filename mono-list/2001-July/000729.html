You have to build a descriptor for the struct, which is passed to
&quot;libffi&quot;.  It then uses this descriptor to determine how to marshal
values.  I'm fairly confident that this descriptor can be built
at runtime from the metadata for the class.

&gt;<i> 2. Doesn't every call have to be defined in advance?
</I>
Same thing - you build a descriptor for the parameters and
then make the call.

&gt;<i> 3. Does it handle bit field endiness (left-to-right vs. right-to-left) which
</I>&gt;<i> may differ between .Net and the C compiler.
</I>
No, it doesn't handle bit fields or unions.  But then, Microsoft
doesn't seem to handle them either.  There are no tokens
or attributes that I can find that change the width of an integer
to something less than the natural size.  I suspect that
structures with bit fields simply cannot be handled, and so
a wrapper function would be needed to handle them.

&gt;<i> 4. Is it a problem if the C compiler used to build mono handles structs
</I>&gt;<i> differently than the C compiler used to build the lib?
</I>
The issue is the ABI, rather than the C compiler.  The ABI is
defined for each OS/CPU.  While ABI's for C++ vary quite
considerably, as Jay pointed out yesterday, the ABI's for C
are fairly well defined.  So, &quot;libffi&quot; shouldn't have any problems
with this.

There are no 100% guarantees here.  I seem to remember
some comments in the gcc backend documentation
that sometimes gcc uses different struct packing rules
than the &quot;native&quot; C compiler for parameter passing on
certain aberrant platforms.

But I think it is probably pretty safe to assume that most
of these aberrant C compilers have been flushed on Unix
systems by now.  Gcc has killed most of them off, and
the few remaining pockets of resistance are dying. :-)

&gt;<i> 5. Does it handle struct members that are assigned offsets in a
</I>&gt;<i> non-ascending order (perhaps reversed)?
</I>
No idea.  I haven't gotten that deep into the &quot;libffi&quot; code yet.
See the aside below.

&gt;<i> 6. If definitions are required (1 and 2 above), then is it any better than
</I>&gt;<i> using class wrappers?
</I>
1 and 2 really aren't an issue, as the necessary information can
be determined at runtime.

Aside: I doubt that we'll be able to handle every possible way
that C functions and struct's work.  However, I believe we can
get enough that the rest can be handled by requiring the
programmer to wrap the underlying API a little in C before
exported via a PInvoke.  No mechanism can be 100%, because
we are dealing with 30 years of accumulated cruft.

Cheers,

Rhys.
