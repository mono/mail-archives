<PRE>I knocked off some of the TODO's, fixed a couple bugs, and added some
missing pieces to the base data types. Here's my changelog:

Assembly: corlib/System

ChangeLog @ mcs/class/corlib/System

2001-07-24  Derek Holden  &lt;<A HREF="mailto:dholden@draper.com">dholden@draper.com</A>&gt;

 * Boolean.cs: Formatted to code style standard. Added GetTypeCode which is
really an IConvertible defined method.

 * Byte.cs: Added a missing Parse method. Put in Parse and ToString
behavior, still need to do the main Parse and ToString.

 * Char.cs: Added a bunch of missing ECMA methods. Commented a specification
discrepency. Still didn't any unicode stuff, though every IsFoo(char c)
method has an IsFoo(string, index) counterpart, added wrappers for those.

 * Convert.cs: Fixed NaN/Inf checking and double/float rounding. Added
ToType for IConvertible classes

 * Double.cs: Fixed ECMA min and max values. Added IsInfinity / IsNaN
methods. Changed Inf/NaN internals.

 * IConvertible.cs: Added comments for using Convert.ToType. Changed return
values to draft base values.

 * Int16.cs: Added a missing Parse statement. Put in behavior for overloaded
ToString and Parse methods.

 * Int32.cs: Added a missing Parse statement. Put in behavior for overloaded
ToString and Parse methods.

 * Int64.cs: Added a missing Parse statement. Put in behavior for overloaded
ToString and Parse methods.

 * Single.cs: Put in ECMA epsilon value. Added IsInfinity / IsNaN methods.
Changed Inf/NaN internals.

 * SByte.cs: Added a missing Parse method. Put in Parse and ToString
behavior, still need to do the main Parse and ToString.

 * UInt16.cs: Added a missing Parse statement. Put in behavior for
overloaded ToString and Parse methods.

 * UInt32.cs: Added a missing Parse statement. Put in behavior for
overloaded ToString and Parse methods.

 * UInt64.cs: Added a missing Parse statement. Put in behavior for
overloaded ToString and Parse methods.
