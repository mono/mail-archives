&quot;Any version of Linux&quot; is quite a requirement.

There are two fundamental ways to go about this:

1. Create distro-specific packages which have proper dependencies, and
don't bundle Mono with your app.  Things like the openSUSE Build Service
can help.

Pro: your packages are smaller, and you don't need to worry about
maintaining Mono and tracking bug/security fixes (as you'll be using the
distro-provided mono).

Con: you won't be maintaining Mono (and thus if/when they upgrade it
your app might break); not all platforms provide a system mono (RHEL).

2. Bundle mono and all dependencies with your app.  Assuming you're just
using WinForms, this will likely be (at minimum) mono, mcs, and
libgdiplus.  Install all into a custom prefix
(e.g. /opt/ComputerLabSolutions), and provide a shell script
(/opt/ComputerLabSolutions/bin/YourAppName) which sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH
and other relevant environment variables so that your mono &amp; libraries
are used (and not the system-provided libraries).

Pro: Your &quot;package&quot; is self-contained, and less reliant on
distro-provided packages.

Con: The feasibility of this approach declines as your dependency list
increases.  Mono &amp; libgdiplus?  Sure.  Gtk# and a custom GTK+?  Uh...

The real killer is dependencies wrt &quot;any version of Linux,&quot; as &quot;any
version of linux&quot; will include distros that have an ancient libgdiplus
(assuming they have one at all), or an equally ancient GTK+ stack (if
you're writing a Gtk# app), and any number of other implicit and
explicit dependencies.

Have you considered just providing a VM image and using SUSE Studio to
build it?
