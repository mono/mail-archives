<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> &gt; Feel free to contribute the changes required to remove the limitations 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on when/where mono performs TCO. That would allow you to contribute F# 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; patches if you wish.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm intrigued - why say that?  I mean - what's the point?  What are you 
</I>&gt;<i> trying to achieve, really?
</I>
Because it is part of growing our community.

Nobody started knowing, Mono has been a learning adventure, and
encouraging people to learn is the only way that an open source project
grows.    We take contributions and contributions are at the core of
many of the innovations that happen in open source.

If you are unable to contribute, you can sit back and wait for us to
implement it.   

Alternatively, if you can not help us with the runtime, you could
liberate some of our engineering cycles if for example you helped in
other areas of Mono.

Perhaps someone could say &quot;In exchange for Foo I will implement Bar&quot;.

But at the end of the day, our attitude is: we want to see Mono grow,
mature, improve, excel and we love working on it.   And part of growing
and maturing is grooming more people to become proficient in our
codebase.

Miguel.

</PRE>
