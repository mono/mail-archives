&gt;<i> You are entirely right.    I like other quants in finance, use R for a lot

</I>&gt;<i> much too slow), Clojure (again too slow), etc ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've also been back-reading on the LLVM vs mono code-generation debate.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
LLVM is significantly slower than mono's JIT even if we no optimizations are
done and the fast inssel backend is used.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I recognize that the .NET CLR does at up-front JIT compilation, whereas the
</I>&gt;<i> java JVM uses profiling to determine what to JIT and how.    Now that may be
</I>&gt;<i> added complexity, but seems to serve Java well.   The cost of JIT is
</I>&gt;<i> amortized or not done at all for portions of the code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Working the way Java does is a huge amount of effort to be effective. It's
probably as hard as making mono's current JIT be on the same level as MS's.



&gt;<i> At this point LLVM has matured and gained enough momentum that one would
</I>&gt;<i> suspect that it is more &quot;expensive&quot; for mono development to enhance its own
</I>&gt;<i> code generation than adopt LLVM.    I raise this issue as there are a number
</I>&gt;<i> of things that LLVM does quite a bit better.   The effort focused on
</I>&gt;<i> in-house code generation could be focused on a better more complete LLVM /
</I>&gt;<i> LLVM-mapping.     Just speaking as a 3rd party looking-in ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Today it's not possible to completely switch to LLVM since, for example, it
runs on less archs than mono does and a binary with LLVM enabled is 3 times
bigger. And I'm not sure if it's even desirable to completely switch, it's
something that we'll eventually figure out once our LLVM backend gets more
mature.
