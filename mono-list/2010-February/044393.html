&gt;<i> I just got around to installing MonoDevelop 2.2 and Mono 2.6 (Both
</I>&gt;<i> using the Disk Images) and am having several problems with web
</I>&gt;<i> applications.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Running with soft debugger usually does not work. &#160;One of three
</I>&gt;<i> things happens (at random): The web browser is never launched but the
</I>&gt;<i> application appears to be running (If I open a browser and navigate to
</I>&gt;<i> localhost, I just get a DNS error so looks like xsp isn't running),
</I>&gt;<i> or; the web browser launches and tries to navigate to 127.0.0.1:8080,
</I>&gt;<i> but after 10 minutes still no response, or; MonoDevelop freezes with
</I>&gt;<i> the wait cursor and I have to Force Quit after several minutes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) I did get the app working once by changing the port to 8081,
</I>&gt;<i> however when I tried running it again it also ran but would no longer
</I>&gt;<i> trigger any breakpoints. &#160;When I recompiled and tried it again, it
</I>&gt;<i> said it could not attach to the port (port in use). &#160;I tried changing
</I>&gt;<i> to 8082, but this also locked up MonoDevelop next time I ran.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) When I did get it to trigger a breakpoint, I noticed a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> limitations with the soft debugger. &#160;First, I cannot drag variables to
</I>&gt;<i> the watch window (there's also a bug if you drag a variable name off
</I>&gt;<i> the IDE the move the mouse back, the mouse stays stuck in selection
</I>&gt;<i> mode). &#160;Second, all information seems to be immutable. &#160;If I change
</I>&gt;<i> button1.Text from &quot;Click me&quot; to &quot;Foo&quot;, it immediately just changes
</I>&gt;<i> back to &quot;Click me&quot;. &#160;Third, I love the fact that there's an Immediate
</I>&gt;<i> Window, but as of yet I've found no use for it. &#160;I cannot declare new
</I>&gt;<i> variables (int x = 5), I cannot seem to change any existing variables
</I>&gt;<i> (button1.Text = &quot;New Value&quot;;) and there's no auto-complete
</I>&gt;<i> (Intellisense) within variables. &#160;Having an immediate window in VS for
</I>&gt;<i> both managed code and script is the single best feature of the VS
</I>&gt;<i> debugger, IMO.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the plus side, MonoDevelop has definitely come a long way in terms
</I>&gt;<i> of Mac usability and raw speed. &#160;It's quick, loads fast, no weird
</I>&gt;<i> re-size bugs (except for the fact I cannot seem to resize the entire
</I>&gt;<i> app, only toggle between maximized and normal).. &#160;I would also /love/
</I>&gt;<i> to see a keyboard layout that would emulate Windows, where pressing
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;End&quot; key actually moved to the end of the line (silliest thing
</I>&gt;<i> ever on Mac apps).. &#160;The one time I did get the debugger working, it
</I>&gt;<i> seemed fast.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Keep up the good work, it's getting there slowly but surely.. &#160;I would
</I>&gt;<i> /love/ to have an open source alternative to Visual Studio 2008 but
</I>&gt;<i> looks like we're still a ways off..
</I>
Could you please file bugs for these issues if you can still reproduce
them with MD 2.2.1 and Mono 2.6.1?
