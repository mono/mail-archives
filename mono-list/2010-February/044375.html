<PRE>Returning to the point of a &quot;compelling case&quot; to implement TCO.

Lots of EU banks and USA banks are running Linux and are heavy users of C++
for their quant work. They build their models in a variety of languages like
Python, Haskell, OCaml, R, etc, then go all the way down to C++/Java for
efficiency. I've already seen some interest in F# from the financial
industry, but the fact that it's limited to Windows/.NET discourages these
people to take a further step.

&gt;<i>From my point of view, these people are tired of Java and C++, they would
</I>rather be deploying their models directly to production in a single
environment. With a good, fast and stable implementation, I think F# has the
strength to bring that.

Microsoft is not building F# because it's a pretty little thing, they are
trying to bring a strong platform for financial and scientific industry.

Best regards,

Diego Frata

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If someone has domain knowledge and implementation skills on top of CLR
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but can show that Mono is defective, its efinitely reasonable to ask them to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> give 'the mono development community' a test case and bug report.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But expecting them to climb the mountain of learning to fiddle with a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> particular CLR implementation's core is nuts, particularly when they have an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alternate that works for them to do their day job. If someone wanted to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> climb that mountain and make the changes, then presumably they would want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> start by reading the copious up to date detailed design documentation and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementation notes on how (and why) it works now,  so that they could size
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the task.  Oh wait ... :-(
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Its much, much more efficient for someone who already groks the internals
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to make fiddly low-level changes, particularly if getting them into the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> release stream requires a lot of trust relationship with the release
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> masters. I think you do a huge disservice to everyone by trying to get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> outsiders to work on something like that - or perhaps you just want people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with bad news to go away so you can paper over the cracks?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Please, ask for test cases and reports.  FWIW I suspect (justa hunch, I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> certainly not an expert) from what's been said that if a calling convention
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> change is needed (and I seem to remember there are some issues that prevent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fuller use of LLVM that one might also want to consider if that sort of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> change is on the cards) then its as much a political and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> major-version-compatibility issue as it is technical, and once again asking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> someone to work on patches in such a situation is laughable, given the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> degree of risk that they might completely waste their time.
