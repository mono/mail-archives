<PRE>Excerpts from Chu's message of Tue Feb 16 15:36:40 -0500 2010:
&gt;<i> Our product is written in .NET, using WinForms. The product needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> deployed and be flexible enough to run on any version of Linux. Ideally,
</I>&gt;<i> we'd like to deploy mono with our installation package.
</I>
You really really don't want to do this. Shipping prerequisites with an
application creates a packaging nightmare for anyone who comes in
contact with your code. A hack like this might be for some reason
accepted in the Windows world but that doesn't make it a sound practice.
Shared object versioning is hard enough without every package and its
mother installing its own libraries.

For the sake of your users' sanity (not to mention good software
engineering), Mono should be installed using the native package manager
of the target machine.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When looking at the options of mono packages for Linux there are many. Is
</I>&gt;<i> there a way to determine which one is needed?
</I>
See above.

Cheers,

- Ben
