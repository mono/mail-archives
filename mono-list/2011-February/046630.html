<PRE>Following a long established tradition of doing a quick
Mono update after we do a major release,
we release Mono 2.10.1 to the world, details as usual:

<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Release_Notes_Mono_2.10.1">http://www.mono-project.com/Release_Notes_Mono_2.10.1</A>

There are four big features in this release that we
backported from our master branch in addition to some 25 fresh
bug fixes:

	Support for running OrchardCMS on Linux.  We also wrote a
	PostgreSQL backend for it.  You can find the patches
	here <A HREF="http://orchard.codeplex.com/discussions/247340">http://orchard.codeplex.com/discussions/247340</A>

	The Parallel Framework's Default task scheduler has been
	switched to use our new and improved internal threadpool that
	we introduced with Mono 2.10.  Previously it used its own (and
	amazing) scheduler, but did not share the same properties as
	.NET as there were by default two active threadpools, now
	there is only one.

	Plenty of updates to the WCF stack.

	OSX is a fast growing OS for Mono, this release brings
	performance counters for OSX as well as adding debugging
	symbols to all of our libraries if you install the CSDK
	package from our download page.

There were also three important regressions from Mono 2.8
that have been fixed.   We encourage everyone to use Mono 2.10.

Enjoy,
Miguel
