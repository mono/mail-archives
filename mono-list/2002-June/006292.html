Ehm, not that I want to start a flamewar, but the CLDC J2EE profile runs on 
devices with as little as 512k ROM and 128k RAM memory (and that includes all 
needed libraries, JVM, class libraries, and program memory). Haven't looked 
at the new Compact .NET for pocketpc's, but I guess it will be pretty similar 
in its requirements.

Having said that, I'd be really cool if Mono could also provide a stripped 
down version tuned for tiny devices, it seems to be a big thing nowadays. 
This way the project could win the support of vendors who want to .NET-enable 
their mobile devices, but want to avoid paying M$ tax on the development 
kits/platform (this is a shot in the dark, but licensing appears to be one of 
the main reasons for people to use embedded Linux in favor of Windows CE).

Pavel.
