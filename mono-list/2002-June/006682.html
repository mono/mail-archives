<PRE>Hello I'm the lead developer of the open Source space flight sim Vegastrike 
(<A HREF="http://vegastrike.sourceforge.net">http://vegastrike.sourceforge.net</A>)
currently we have an inferior (as in slow, hard to add to, etc), hand-written 
scripting language we call C-flat.  It's somewhat object oriented, but it is 
extremely slow and difficult tog et things to work, and the performance is 
about 1/20 that of standard C debug code.

Being a game performance and ease of use are two extremely important facets 
of choosing a scripting language.

So I searched the internet and found Boost as a method to export C++ classes 
to python....

but people are recommending C# to me....  though I have searched at least 2 
hours on the net to find no mention of how exactly to call C# functions from 
C++ and call C++ functions (and classes) from C#....

I looked at gtk-sharp and it seems like they have some autogenerated XML to 
define the glue layer or something.....

could anyone point to a simple howto telling how someone coudl do the 
following
happy.cs 

...
int mycsharpfunction () {
    return my_c_function();
}
...

main.c

int my_c_function () {
   return 4364;
}
int main () {
      printf  (&quot;%d&quot;,mycsharpfunction());
}


or better
mycsharpclass.cs
class mycsharpclass  {
  int something;
  public mycsharpclass (myclass &amp;c) {
     something = c.dosomething;
  }
}


myclass.c
class myclass {
   int dosomething () {return 1;}

}
int main () {
   myclass c;
   mycsharpclass d = new mycsharpclass (c);
}

are both of these ideas (i.e. lame pseudocode) possible in C#?  is there a 
simple howto about how I could do either or both of these things?  or a 
program that will generate XML interfaces for this stuff...I only see 2 
binaries advertised...but there must be something more...somethign deeper :-)

anyhow  thank you all for your time...I'm sure I'm not the only one with this 
question, but there is so much hype and noise about C# that any reasonable 
search string has been giving me static in google
