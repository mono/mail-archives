<PRE>Hello Andrew,

&gt;<i> No problem, I'll get that done in the next few days.  I'm mostly
</I>&gt;<i> interested in the compiler, but I plan on doing some more class library
</I>&gt;<i> stuff to get going.  I'll also send a seperate patch which will stop the
</I>&gt;<i> compiler from aborting when it encounters overly large integer literals
</I>&gt;<i> too.
</I>
Thanks, I would love to get such a patch.

&gt;<i> I noticed that the &quot;make sure each case in a switch() ends in break&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;make sure all control paths return an appropriately typed value&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> features both need the same control-flow analysis.  I intend to look at
</I>&gt;<i> that too, but more for my own education rather than having any high
</I>&gt;<i> probability of coding the whole thing.
</I>
Well, notice that currently we do handle the second case (make sure all
control paths return an appropriately typed value).  So I believe that
the switch code could use this information to its advantage.  But I have
to sit down and think a bit more about this.

Basically what this means is that a more complex framework for data flow
analysis is not required to handle this particular case (unless am
proved wrong).   A more complex framework is required to handle definite
assignment though (and btw, a BitVector is just what we need for this
;-)

&gt;<i> Firstly, what's the policy on the text in exceptions?  Should they match
</I>&gt;<i> the M$ implementation?  I only ask this because while I was learning C# I
</I>&gt;<i> misunderstood format specifiers but only got an unhelpfully generic &quot;Bad
</I>&gt;<i> format string&quot; exception rather than, for example, &quot;Bad width specifier in
</I>&gt;<i> format string&quot;.  In general, should people be submitting patches to
</I>&gt;<i> improve things like this or is there some Deeper Reason behind the choice
</I>&gt;<i> of error messages.
</I>
We should try to have good error reports, so improvements in this area
are always welcome, and deviating from the Microsoft ones for the sake
of clarity will always be good.

&gt;<i> Secondly, how do you choose the compiler error number which gets passed to
</I>&gt;<i> Report.Error()?  Again, I suspect you might be matching the M$ behaviour
</I>&gt;<i> but I only have a linux box here so I can't check.
</I>
I am using the same error numbers that the Microsoft C# compiler emits,
this serves two purposes:

	* Reuse the on-line documentation for their errors until we have
	  our own documentation.

	* Make sure we catch all errors their compiler does by having 
	  a test case for each error we are supposed to report.

Miguel.
