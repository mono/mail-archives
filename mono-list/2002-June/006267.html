Awesome,

I think I'll be going to give it a shot then :)

Thank you, and everyone else, for the comments and feedback so far. As 
I'm not the worlds fastest coder, it will take me some time to get 
anything running. By then I expect Mono to have made further strides 
forward as well so any current concerns about performance will hopefully 
lessened by then as well :)

Kind regards,

Remco

The fact that 47 PEOPLE are yelling and sweat is cascading down my
