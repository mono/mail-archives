<PRE>Miguel, I know you said you had some contact with the ECMA guys. What's
the story on updating the ECMA spec with regards to compatibility with
what MS has released? Are they happy with the fact that the (currently)
only existing implementation of the spec, and the one on which the spec
was based doesn't actually comply?

Piers.

They have not updated the ECMA spec, but put all the
changes to their web page. There is no real statement
on what to use. Problem is that everyone uses the new
version from MS, and the ECMA version is just getting
older. 

It is not clear to be if we can even use the Microsoft
Copy of the ECMA, because of the MSDN copyright.
Remember the perl script that extracts code from
documents, well we dont want to get into the same
issue by using the copyrighted spec and not the
standard.

&gt;<i> proprietary extensions (Borland 
</I>&gt;<i> Turbo Pascal/Delphi/Kylix coming to my mind as
</I>&gt;<i> something proprietary and 
</I>&gt;<i> sucessfull and well beyond what Pascal used to be),
</I>&gt;<i> that could not be 
</I>&gt;<i> implemented by competitors.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Their study on &quot;generics&quot; support is a prime
</I>&gt;<i> example, being covered by 
</I>&gt;<i> copyrights, and possibly patents, from Microsoft
</I>&gt;<i> Research.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the sake of many mono-hackers: &quot;generics&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> something akin to C++ 
</I>&gt;<i> templates, but that can also expand AT RUNTIME with
</I>&gt;<i> FULL TYPE-SAFETY. That 
</I>&gt;<i> would make possible to have typed ArrayLists, as we
</I>&gt;<i> now have typed arrays.
</I>That sounds interesting. 
Is it in the C# ECMA spec, i did not see that yet.


Thanks again for your insite.
