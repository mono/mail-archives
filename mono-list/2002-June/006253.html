<PRE>As someone pointed out to me in a off-list message; it is really hard to
say how well it will scale until you try it. Back when I tried doing an
irc services daemon using Java, the networking library really only
offered a one socket per thread type model. As you can imagine, few
machines would be able to support 10000 users with this model. As of
J2SE 1.4, the networking library for Java has a select like model that
should allow it to scale much better. There is still the issue of all
that string manipulation, but my understanding is that has improved as
well in the Java camp.

I would love to be able to use a higher level language than C for things
like irc, but IMHO none of the languages out there, Java or C#, are
really ready to handle those kinds of loads.

It would be pretty easy to write a test though. There are plenty of
script kiddie programs on the net to load test a daemon with.
