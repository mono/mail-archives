Dear Matt,

The ircd would (if it ever would come out of development) support a 
network of about 1250 users at peek times. I'd like to have it scale well 
to 10000 users as one might never know what the future might bring. Do 
you have any idea what the performance penalty might be between C# and a 
natively compiled C program? I know Java performs much better now than 
only a few years back and was hoping that C# might be able to run the 
ircd at about 2x the cost of native code as that would be acceptable to 
me.

Kind regards,

Remmy
