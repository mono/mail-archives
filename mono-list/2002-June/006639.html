<PRE>Hi there,

	Apologies for arriving so late with my clueless questions; anyway -
I've been poking around with delegates, and they seem quite pleasant,
but inadequate for what I need.

	I suppose I need to know how to do 2 things, and search as I do I can't
seem to see how to do them:

	a) A way to specify that a certain object is extremely late 
	   linked, such that I can invoke arbitrary methods on it, and
	   the compiler will do ~no checking eg.

	LateLinkType t = (LateLinkType) myObject;

	t.unknownMethod (&quot;astring&quot;);

	   The above being 'useful' for a stubless ORB. Of course, 
	perhaps it's possible that I have to have all the type 
	information there at compile time and it's not possible to have
	a stub-less CORBA wrapper. I can see how the skel-less process
	works, we do a GetType (), find the MethodInfo, and do an Invoke
	but how should the stub case work ?

	b) A way to handle delegates that is elegant; eg. I wish to
	   implement the following (or similar):

	private void sizeAllocate (Widget w, Allocation a,
				   Object closure);	
	...
		w.addHandler (&quot;size_allocate&quot;, sizeAllocate, myObject);

	   I don't mind doing a (redundant) new Foo (sizeAllocate), and 
	I can see how you can do this with loads of delegates: new 
	DelegateWidgetAllocation (sizeAllocate) eg. but I don't want to
	go around typing the method signature twice - once in declaring 
	it, and once in a delegate allocation scheme.

	   Is it possible to coerce the type information out of a method
	name by some clever casting ? and if so, how in the (seemingly 
	unexpandable) delegate constructon scheme ?

	Seemingly I've missed the plot somewhere here :-)

	Thanks in advance,

		Michael.
