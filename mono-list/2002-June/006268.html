It was my understanding that a program compiled into the bytecode 
language should be able to run on any .NET compatible platform unchanged. 
If this is not yet the case today but is planned to be in say, half a 
year down the road, then that would be acceptable as well.

Anyone? :)

Yes, so far I've been impressed and pleased by the answers received. They 
also look at the subject from different perspectives; very nice indeed :)

&gt;<i> Also someone from the Portable.Net team was trying to write an IRC bot

</I>&gt;<i> I prefer Portable.Net to Mono, coz their compiler is in C and I can

</I>
Ok, I had not heard about portable.net yet. (I''ve only started looking 
into this whole thing yesterday). Am I right in understanding that I 
should be able to code an application in C# and compile it under either 
Mono / Portable.Net / Microsoft .NET and have it work?

&gt;<i> Btw, pnet seems to be better focussed on a server platform as that was
</I>&gt;<i> the original intention -- unlike Mono's Gnome desktop integration
</I>&gt;<i> ideas.
</I>
Thank you for your response :)

Kind regards,

Remco
