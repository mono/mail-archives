<PRE>Huh.  I just sent another message.  I don't care that much.  I was just 
bored.  i am by no means an artist, but decided to play and took the 
advice of others to come up with a &quot;community logo&quot;.  I have been 
working on several other project and following mono quite closely and 
needed a break.  So, as previously stated, in the spirit of open-source, i 
made a contribution.  I also set up a poll on my site with images.  If 
you would like, I will take it down.  Up to you - you are the man.  :-)

I appreciate your effort to improve the logo, but in matters of taste
and style, it is very hard to have any kind of agreement, so in this
particular case, we are just going to have to go with what we have.

When we first chose the name &quot;Ximian&quot; for the company, we hated the name
terribly.   I did not like it at all, specially since we were changing
the name from the cool `Helix Code'.   Eventually, Ximian grew up on me,
and now I am in love with the name. 

Miguel.
