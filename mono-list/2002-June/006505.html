no, only the first time.

Well, I'd like to hack on the class libraries. I'm trying to build an app, 
but have bumped into things I need which are unimplemented (like Process).

I installed a ton of stuff on my XP/VMWare partition and ran
mono-build-win32.sh, but it still failed to build. I don't have the error
handy. Still, I'd rather stick to linux b/c XP is deadly slow and switching
back and forth is a major pain.

IOW, I would love to start contributing, but I haven't been able to
bootstrap. If I could just do it all in Linux, I would be a hell of a lot
more productive.

thanks,

stewart
