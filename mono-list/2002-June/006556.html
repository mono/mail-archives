I'm currently working on this and I'm getting a few more bugs fixed every
time I hack on it.  Unfortunately I can only hack a very few hours a week
on it (and almost nothing the last two weeks because I was watching too
much soccer .....), so it's only advancing very slowly.

It's hard to make any kind of a status report since most of the time you
need to fix one bug before you'll see the next one - and each time, mcs
compiles a few more files in corlib ....

Our soccer team has a very important match tomorrow (and hopefully an
even more important one on Tuesday), so I already used up all my hacking
time for this week, I'll hopefully be back next weekend :-(

My summer holidays start around July 20th and I'll have a lot more time
then.
