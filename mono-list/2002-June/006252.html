Indeed. One of my longer standing 'plans for the future' would include 
just that. The IRC server I have in mind would work as a plain IRC server 
for clients but would use a completely different sort of server &lt;--&gt; 
server protocol. Ideas I've been playing with are redundant links between 
servers, checksums on channels / users for less expensive netjoins 
(avoiding having to resend thousands of users / channels after a split) 
etc.

Anyways, that is getting a bit too much off topic for this list :)  If 
interested, we can talk further about it on another list or in email :)

Kind regards,

Remco
