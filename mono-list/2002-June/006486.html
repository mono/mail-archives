Documentation is supposed to make things clearer: this paragraph makes
things worse than they are already and it's completely wrong: please
remove it from cvs.

mcs is the C# compiler and it can be compiled and run just fine on Linux
since a few months. There is also a tarball that is called mcs and
includes the sources of the mcs compiler and of the class libraries.
I guess it's better to split it so that it causes less confusion.
Some of the class libraries can be compiled with the mono runtime, but
not yet corlib. It should be noted, though, that the default make
targets still use csc to build them, so when you type make it may try to
run it and fail.

</I>
It's better to use english messages in the sample texts.

&gt;<i> 		Run the configure script:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 			./configure.in
</I>
It's &quot;./configure&quot;. 
I haven't read the rest: it's probably better to remove this document
from cvs.
