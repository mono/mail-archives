<PRE>Dear all,

Having just subscribed to this list I am not sure if this is the right 
place to ask or not, but lacking any alternatives I'll ask my questions 
in here anyways. Please do not scold too loudly at me if these questions 
are completely out of place.

I have been looking into .NET for work purposes. As I'm a *nix man by 
heart, I naturally came across Mono. It seemed like a good idea for me to 
get some experience with C# by developing an application using the tools 
available.

One of my interests is IRC and as such I'm looking into developing an IRC 
daemon. I figure that I need for this could objects to open and use 
sockets, a way of efficiently using regular expressions and string 
functions as well as get somewhat decent performance out of it. Now my 
question is, does Mono (currently) have the tools needed for such a 
project? Would you recommend the use of C# for such a project? If not, 
why not?

I realise that by asking this list I'll get somewhat biased answers but 
I'm interested in your opinions on it.

Kind regards,

Remco Rijnders
