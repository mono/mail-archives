<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> As someone pointed out to me in a off-list message; it is really hard to
</I>&gt;<i> say how well it will scale until you try it. Back when I tried doing an
</I>&gt;<i> irc services daemon using Java, the networking library really only
</I>&gt;<i> offered a one socket per thread type model. As you can imagine, few
</I>&gt;<i> machines would be able to support 10000 users with this model. As of
</I>&gt;<i> J2SE 1.4, the networking library for Java has a select like model that
</I>&gt;<i> should allow it to scale much better. There is still the issue of all
</I>&gt;<i> that string manipulation, but my understanding is that has improved as
</I>&gt;<i> well in the Java camp.
</I>
This is an interesting comment, and reminded me of more information from
my friend's irc server.

The .NET framework (C# being just a front-end to the classes really)
comes with a select-like model like the one you describe, but it also
comes with support for asynchronous notifications on I/O, which is
exactly the model that Jordi needed for his irc server, because he said
select()/poll()-based systems were too slow and did not scale.

So maybe we got the best of all worlds ;-)

Miguel
