<PRE>Only now I´ve found some time to answer. Sorry!

&gt;<i>I cannot find this on the english site.
</I>That article was written by an brazilian .NET evangelist, for the local site 
only...

&gt;<i>I wonder what the brazilian developers has to say
</I>&gt;<i>about this?
</I>
Let´s look at the more important issues...

&gt;<i>&quot;the result is that the Java is a language proprietor
</I>&gt;<i>while the C # is not&quot;
</I>
The correct translation is:
&quot;the result is that Java is a proprietary language while C# isn´t&quot;.

Well, I agree about the language being an standard, and that is far better 
than the Java situation, but that is just not enough to say it´s open, or 
will be kept open: if Microsoft doesn´t make a commitment to advance the 
language always through ECMA, they can make proprietary extensions (Borland 
Turbo Pascal/Delphi/Kylix coming to my mind as something proprietary and 
sucessfull and well beyond what Pascal used to be), that could not be 
implemented by competitors.

Their study on &quot;generics&quot; support is a prime example, being covered by 
copyrights, and possibly patents, from Microsoft Research.

For the sake of many mono-hackers: &quot;generics&quot; is something akin to C++ 
templates, but that can also expand AT RUNTIME with FULL TYPE-SAFETY. That 
would make possible to have typed ArrayLists, as we now have typed arrays.

&gt;<i>&quot;Efforts exist to carry the C#/.NET for other
</I>&gt;<i>platforms, of which I would detach the Mono...&quot;
</I>
Better translated as:
&quot;There are efforts to port C# and .NET to other platforms,
of which I would prominently cite the Mono Project...&quot;

But take a grain of salt with it because I know the author personally. He is 
a very skilled developer and trainer on development technologies, turned 
.NET evangelist, but just 2 facts:

1 - He used to fight in the Borland side, and switched colors, because of 
&quot;market pressures...&quot;.
2 - HE DOESN´T BELIEVE IN OPEN SOURCE!!! So he was citing us just as 
Microsoft usually does: as a marketing ploy, because we are giving them a 
technical endorsement. They want to advance .NET adoption but, obviously, 
they want their implementation to be the (over)ruling one...
