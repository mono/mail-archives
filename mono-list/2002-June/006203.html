<PRE>Hello Erick,

&gt;<i> Okay everyone.  I bitched about the logo, so in the spirit of open-source 
</I>&gt;<i> I took some time, messed around and came up with a few variations of my 
</I>&gt;<i> own.  They have elements of the original and is legible when resized to 
</I>&gt;<i> icon sizes.  Anyone have any comments, suggestions, or is this now closed 
</I>&gt;<i> for discussion?
</I>
I appreciate your effort to improve the logo, but in matters of taste
and style, it is very hard to have any kind of agreement, so in this
particular case, we are just going to have to go with what we have.

When we first chose the name &quot;Ximian&quot; for the company, we hated the name
terribly.   I did not like it at all, specially since we were changing
the name from the cool `Helix Code'.   Eventually, Ximian grew up on me,
and now I am in love with the name. 

Miguel.
