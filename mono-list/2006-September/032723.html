<PRE>I'm getting an odd error that I can't seem to track down.  For some time 
now, I've been hosting 2 vhosts using apache/mod_mono.  Now, one of the 
sites was re-written in php, so I removed from the config files 
(/etc/apache/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf and 
/etc/apache/extra/httpd-mono.conf) any references to that site and 
re-created the vhost entry as I normally would for a php site.

However, now when I try to view the remaining .NET site, it gives me an 
error saying it can't find the dll file for the other site (the one that 
was removed).  I re-started httpd, even rebooted the web server to make 
absolutely sure that all services were re-started, but no luck.

Any ideas where there may still be a reference to that file somewhere 
that I would need to remove?  Any help would be much appreciated, thank you.
