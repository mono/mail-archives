<PRE>Yes, if you are running your app on Windows, then in my experience there
is no more stable version - and we've checked out *every* one.  We have
an application that challenges many areas of System.Windows.Forms and it
does not work under any version of Mono since 1.1.9.2.  XSP has had
problems with the GC since 1.1.12.x.

If you are advising someone to upgrade to a later version be sure of
your facts.  I'm sure of mine and Mats' own experience is similar.
Moreover, your suggestion of using 1.1.13.8 is only valid under Linux
where adequate testing was done by the Mono team to, if my recollection
is correct, to meet their obligations for the Suse release.  As Miguel
has confirmed to me in the past, their focus is on Linux support.

If the associated bugs are fixed then that's great.  But 77075 is not
fixed as of 1.1.17.2 and XSP fails under even modest use on Windows.
Anyway, I think *all* duplicates are marked as RESOLVED so they don't
mess up the bug reporting stats.

At the bottom of the 77075 bug report its marked as duplicates of 2 
other bugs (77779 &amp; 79349), both of which have been resolved.  My 
assumption would be that 77075 is resolved as well.

I still don't understand why you wouldn't just use the version of Mono 
that works.  Since 1.1.16 is a beta release, I would recommend going 
with the latest beta: 1.1.17.1.
