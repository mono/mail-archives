I know, which is why I asked it in the context of non-official,  
hardly detectable Mono installations. If it were supported by the  
official Mono installer it would not matter to that aspect. :-)


&gt;<i> It might be possible to port Mono to Win9x/ME (especially with the

Serge posted a wrapper library some time ago on the list (it's also  
mentioned in the official FAQ) to compile Mono on Cygwin with MSLU -  
but I was unable to compile Mono 1.1.15 with it:

<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-list/2006-April/031317.html">http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-list/2006-April/031317.html</A>

Not getting any answer from the list I had also written to Serge  
personally but didn't get a reply either. So that was a dead end for me.

The reason I tried is that there is a legacy DOS application running  
on a Windows 95 system that I would like to replace with a more  
modern .NET based app, and I need a way of migrating it while still  
running.

My idea was to run a Mono based server app on the Win95 machine  
interop'ing with the legacy app as a three-tier solution...

The only alternative I've come up with was exposing the legacy data  
files as a Windows share and reading them from remote; I'm still  
figuring out the file format from a local copy so haven't tested that  
yet - would I get change notifications from such a remote SMB share  
with FileSystemWatcher?
