Yes, this is a known issue.  Writable mmap support has been on the
wishlist for probably a year, but I gather that it's a tough problem.
 Locking is another one that comes up often, but it looks like that's
been added in 2.6 beta.

&gt;<i> Do you have any other easily runnable tests?  Or is hand-crafting test

</I>
I think I've found more bugs in my own filesystem by running programs.
 My tests are just for edge cases of my filesystem that I don't think
a random program would trigger.  But the best reports I've had are
from people running programs I've never used.  It is a typical test
problem - if you write custom tests then you're only going to test for
things you know about.  I would have never guessed the behavior of
Mutt, or rsync, or Evolution until I saw the filesystem debug traces..

You could also try creating a user on your system with the home
directory in a virtual filesystem.  Some people run their systems like
this (to get an encrypted home dir, for example), and those people
were the biggest source of bug reports for me.  But you may find that
Mono applications don't work, because Mono expects to be able to make
writable mmap mappings for various files in the home directory (at
least that was the case a year ago).

And by the way, maybe you know, why does every Mono app need a
writable mmap of things from ~/.wapi ?

Valient
