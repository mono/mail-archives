<PRE>Hey folks,

    I think it would be a good idea to start doing the same thing that
the Linux kernel guys are doing: Certificates of Origin for patches.
This basically means that patches would have to contain the following
notice:

	(This is copy pasted from <A HREF="http://linux.yyz.us/patch-format.html">http://linux.yyz.us/patch-format.html</A>)

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the
patch, which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right to
pass it on as a open-source patch. The rules are pretty simple: if you
can certify the below: 

        Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

        By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

        (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
            have the right to submit it under the open source license
            indicated in the file; or

        (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
            of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
            license and I have the right under that license to submit that
            work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
            by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
            permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
            in the file; or

        (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
            person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
            it.

        (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
            are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
            personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
            maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
            this project or the open source license(s) involved.

then you just add a line at the end of your patch description, saying 

        Signed-off-by: Random J Developer &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-list">random at developer.org</A>&gt;
