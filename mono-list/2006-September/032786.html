I run the same stack for www.govtrack.us which gets around 15k page
views a day, on a mid-to-low-end server.  Up to about this load I have
had no stability issues and would definitely recommend using mono.
(OTOH, I generate each page in an unusual way, so I can't speak for the
ASPX side of things.)

Above that load, I've had some memory issues where mono would grow in
size over the course of a day filling up the available RAM.  At least
one other person has posted a similar problem to the list.  On the
bright side, I haven't had this problem recently, but I've had less
traffic recently than when I last saw the problem.  (And, OTOH, I can't
say for sure that that was even mono's fault and not my own.)  The
solution was to restart mod-mono-server often (whenever the server
started to get a bit unresponsive).

It sounds like your site might be around that threshold where I started
to have problems, so I can't say anything conclusive besides best of luck!
