<PRE>Hi all,

I've been trying to build a large ASP.NET 2.0 project from work under 
Mono for a long time.  I've been mainly tinkering by hand (manually 
running gmcs &amp; xsp) because I could never get very far anyway.

Well now that ASP.NET 2.0 support is getting quite good in Mono, I find 
manually compiling things is just a waste of time and would like to use 
a build process.

My VS 2005 Solution file doesn't appear to contain much real building 
information, so I'm guessing VS 2005 &amp; the integrated ASP.NET server 
just automagically handle building App_Code and code behind files. 
However, Mono doesn't support auto-compiling App_Code (as far as I know).

So my question is: what build tool(s) should I learn in order to build a 
n ASP.NET 2.0 application using Mono?  Please don't say 
autotools/makefiles.  I've looked at makefiles a few times before, but 
they make my eyes bleed.  :)  I've heard NAnt and SCons are both very 
good, but I really have no idea what to use.

Thanks in advance!
