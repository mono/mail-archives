I don't think anyone actively made a design decision to always display a
console window for the mono process. I think it probably was considered,
but I would call it more a &quot;design concession&quot;. Mono aims for seamless
compatibility, to the extent that it is possible, with MS .NET, and this
issue should not, I think, be an exception.

&gt;<i>Normally this nice solution could be used on Windows XP and 2003 and the

</I>
For what it's worth, Java on Windows has two separate interpreter binaries.
'java.exe' attaches to the console (i.e., specifies the console subsystem
in the header), while 'javaw.exe' detaches from the console (i.e.,
specifies the Windows subsystem). This also has two executables, but
doesn't try to do any hackery involving AttachConsole and/or FreeConsole.
I'm certainly not in the camp that believes mono should blindly copy Java
in every aspect, but the people at Sun researched this problem as well and
weighed the alternatives and this is what they came up with. It makes sense
to me :-)

</I>
I haven't read the article, but I agree that anything that uses COM files
as containers for PE images is horrifically ugly. :-)
