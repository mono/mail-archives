<PRE>Hi Joe,

Any control I create works in any place, as long as it's included in any
page in my root directory.  My last test proved it beyond any doubt.  I
create a user control in one subdirectory and tried to call it from a page
in a different subdirectory.  I then created a page in my root directory and
included the user control.  After that, everything worked.  I didn't modify
the user control or the first page at all.  It worked as soon as I included
it in a page in my root directory.  If I knew it was a bug, I'd report it,
but this may be the intended behavior for all I know.

Carl

Subject: RE: [Mono-list] Mapping across application not allowed?

Hi Carl,

If SiteFooter.ascx works in both places there must be
something different about the other controls that
don't work. Is there a difference in namespace or a
case sensitivity difference. Are you compiling or
using inline script blocks? 

I think I would have to see the code to be of any more
help. It certainly could be a bug in mono, you could
create a test case and submit a bug report.

Joe
