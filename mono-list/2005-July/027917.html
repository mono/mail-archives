<PRE>
&gt;<i> &gt; From: Chris Aitken
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get an error saying &quot;Mapping across application not allowed.&quot; I have 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only one MonoApplication set up.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I understand you are trying to map a path inside the application 
</I>&gt;<i> boundary of the executing application. But you get cross-application 
</I>&gt;<i> mapping error.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the problem is this then this is a bug and you should file a 
</I>&gt;<i> bugreport at <A HREF="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/">http://bugzilla.ximian.com/</A>
</I>
Can I appeal to the better natured posters/trimmers here.

Someone has trimmed one of my replies to Carl Olsen regarding his
cross-application issue. By not trimming carefully, I am now getting
replies, as it appears as though the issue is mine.

Whilst most of these replies are on list, I am getting my personal inbox
filled with emails regarding an issue that I have never had.

This is not a rant against Kornel - he was just replying to what looked like
my problem - with some bug reporting advice.

Can we pay a little more attention to threads, and identify who has the
issue, and who is helping them.

This isn't meant to be a rant - just some friendly advice to ensure those
that have the issue receive the help ;)

Chris
