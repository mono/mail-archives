</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I always respected Miguel de Icaza's judgment and he always has a good 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and sane point of view.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am a little troubled about the recent announcement, about the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Novell/Microsoft agreement.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously you don't appreciate much from his posts before, as it is
</I>&gt;<i> very unlikely that you could understand them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Didn't Miguel de Icaza assured us that Mono was safe, that there are no 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; known patents that Mono infringes, that .NET is an ECMA
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; standard, that even if Mono infringes on some patents then the Open 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Inventions Network will protect it ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In objective perspective, he did along with the context above.
</I>&gt;<i> In subjective perspective, Miguel never assured idiots like you that.
</I>&gt;<i> In that context, he just assured those who understand him so well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Didn't Miguel said that Novell conducted a whole investigation on 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Microsoft owned patents and no infringed patents where found ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No he didn't did. If you object, showed the exact evidence.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And Novell is the owner of the Unix copyrights (I am no lawyer, so 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; please correct me if I am wrong) ... and Novell just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; admitted that GNU/Linux has pieces that infringe on Microsoft's 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; intellectual property ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You want to conceive us like your Microsoft that Linux infringes
</I>&gt;<i> MS patents, but Novell never said Linux infringes MS patents.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, no one assured that Linux infringes or will
</I>&gt;<i> infringe others' patents (that's ok; if someone blames patent 
</I>&gt;<i> infringement, then he or she must *first* point the exact patents
</I>&gt;<i> out). But that does not mean Linux is always safe.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As Miguel has always been pointing out, no software in the world
</I>&gt;<i> is safe in this context.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If someone says that if there is no assurance on a technology
</I>&gt;<i> we should never push it, then what happens to W3C.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; True or not true ... there are many companies that might stand up and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; demand the same royalties that Microsoft is asking.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The solution is to fight  the whole software patents system, not getting 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; around it by a minor deal with the devil himself.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some economists and legal scholars has been successful to weaken
</I>&gt;<i> software patents by writing evident papers asserting that software
</I>&gt;<i> patents are rather harmful. I also wrote some legal analysis on
</I>&gt;<i> software patents in the context of Japanese legal academic argument
</I>&gt;<i> and sent them to the government.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some other people, like Bill Gates, claimed that US patent system
</I>&gt;<i> should not grant too many patents.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> None of idiots like you made it successful. You never fight software
</I>&gt;<i> patents in reality.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What if companies like IBM or Oracle or Apple take a stand and demand 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the same thing ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You should read Miguel's posts 100x again and understand what OIN is.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Miguel says in his blog something like:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     &quot;So today we have secured a peace of mind for Novell customers that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; might have been worried about possible patent infringements open source 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; deployments&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But doesn't anyone at Novell notice that the REST of the open-source 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; landscape is now in a greater danger than before ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Huh? Nothing has changed in non-mono land in this context.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unlike idiots like you, Microsoft and Novell know that the partnership
</I>&gt;<i> will expire at 2012. (as a sane person) I see no reason to endanger
</I>&gt;<i> their own businesses.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What is happening ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I already invested in Mono, I also switched to Gnome the whole network 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that I am managing, Gnome which is tainted with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Novell's products.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am not the only one wondering:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You are not the only one idiot wondering, but you are the only idiot
</I>&gt;<i> who tries to throw your shit to others. Let's wait for your
</I>&gt;<i> graduation from junior high school and post again.
