	This is a method I call &quot;binary chop&quot; - it works well when you're
writing new code, and introduce a small number (preferably 1) of
bugs :-), and when the code is easy to understand &amp; partition, but when
there are a potentially arbitrary number of vicious problems and
interactions, and the code is not easy to reduce reliably, it's not such
a powerful tool.

	Is this how you fix all your problems ? there is no verbose debug
output you use or better tracing logic ?

&gt;<i> &gt; 	What I would -love- would be a simple piece of code that just dumped

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; re-threw the exception, perhaps in 'XslTemplate.Evaluate' or something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (?) [ we get a good number of frames of that ].
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In such case you could just use mono-xmltool to debug your XSLT.
</I>
	Well - unfortunately, that's not really feasible - the XML that the
XSLT produces is concealed away and produced by pre-processing a ton of
random other files into each other (AFAICS on demand by the XSLT) ;-) so
it is rather hard just to pull out the XML [ though of course this is a
good suggestion ].

&gt;<i> Or just wrap around the entire transformation with &quot;try&quot; and &quot;catch
</I>&gt;<i> XsltException&quot;, and get LineNumber and LinePosition from there.
</I>&gt;<i> Actually its Message property indicates them, so you don't have to
</I>&gt;<i> retrieve those numbers.
</I>
	Well - the problem here is that the exception / evilness is thrown by
code run -from- the XSLT code, not the code itself - so the real
exception is some random &quot;Stack Empty during .pop()&quot; type thing. Of
course the -real- problem is that the XSLT script has (somehow) managed
to produce more element closes than opens :-) getting a trace of where
we were in those 55k lines when that happened -might- help find where we
go wrong.

&gt;<i> Any omitted information wouldn't result in better debugging. That is not
</I>&gt;<i> what we call &quot;good diagnostics&quot;.
</I>
	I find that hard to parse. However, since you appear reluctant to help,
I will try and dive in and implement something to emit more of the
omitted information :-) perhaps that will help me find the root problems
more quickly.

	Regards,

		Michael.
