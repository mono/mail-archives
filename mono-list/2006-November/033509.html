	Sure - hopefully it's a fairly simple thing I want.

	Totally agreed - particularly it prolly hurts people debugging the
actual XSLT impl. itself :-)

&gt;<i>  An immediate concern example is that

	Yep - can you take this on ? also - (for me) it'd be fine to just do:
	$ MONO_XSLT_DEBUG=1 mono foo.exe

	and instead of trying to make the exception more verbose itself, just
dump the output to System.Console a frame at a time - that would also
rather shrinks the patch and make it more useful.

	Can you suggest a good name for the env. var ? or what would be
immeasurably better would be if you could rescue something useful from
my hack and commit it yourself ? ;-)

	FWIW - someone else helped me find the cause of the problem - which (it
appears) is tied to Mono emitting 'WriteFullEndElement' very frequently,
where (apparently) Microsoft ~never emit it (for the same data set). Of
course, that could be related to some other deeper oddness
somewhere :-), but it is strange nonetheless.

	Anyhow - thanks again,

		Michael.
