<PRE>Hi,

&gt;&gt;<i> I figured Mono was way too big for my phone and Symbian OS only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> includes a POSIX compatibility library and otherwise uses C++
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> libraries along with its own conventions, so porting Mono directly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seemed problematic at least.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mono does require very little from the underlying OS other than Posix.
</I>&gt;<i> It might be interesting to get it working on that platform as well.
</I>
I defintely agree that this would have been the easiest, yes. Mono  
does use TLS so would be okay, however I am not aware of any of its  
dependencies (glib, etc.) being available, also Symbian uses its own  
(ugly) Perl-based make system on Windows.

&gt;<i> Writing a fully compliant CLI is going to take a lot longer than
</I>&gt;<i> carefully turning features off
</I>
I'd guess that!

&gt;<i> (we already support turning a few
</I>&gt;<i> features off, see:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Small_footprint">http://www.mono-project.com/Small_footprint</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For more details.
</I>
Last time I checked I believe Mono was about 8 MB in whole. By  
comparison my phone has 4 MB in whole minus RAM and data (with no  
memory expansion possibilities) so a CLI should be no larger than  
maybe 500 KB - I doubt a compiler optimization, stripped debug  
symbols and locales would make such a big difference, and regarding  
the required autoconf etc. changes getting Mono to compile on Intel  
OS X was already a hard thing for me! I can understand that Symbian  
OS (just like Solaris) is not Novell's top priority, but there was  
virtually no response from other potential contributors - the posts  
were originally about porting Mono after all - and alone I am at a  
loss there.

Symbian OS rarely uses exes but mostly dlls even for applications up  
to Symbian OS 8.x, so memory cleanup is key which it does using  
strict two-phase object construction, a cleanup stack and its own  
exception handling mechanism (C++ exceptions only on Symbian OS 9.x);  
to support this infrastructure there are so-called descriptors that  
wrap access to arrays or memory areas. Supporting all this would make  
the Mono codebase pretty ugly with lots of #ifdefs.
