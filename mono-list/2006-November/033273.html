<PRE>Hi,

THESE PACKAGES ARE NOT OFFICIAL - THEY ARE NOT FROM ANY REDHAT
ENGINEER[1] - THEY MAY DESTROY EVERYTHING YOU HAVE EVER STOOD FOR AND
CAUSE A FULL SCALE NUCLEAR WAR!

While I was bored and following the announcement on the Mono-devel and
main lists that 1.2 has now been tagged, I decided to build the new rpms
for mono, libgdiplus and mod_mono and make them available.

<A HREF="http://nodoid.homelinux.org/csharp/">http://nodoid.homelinux.org/csharp/</A> [2]

You can get the srpms (with slightly modified spec files from the FC
srpms) as well as x86_64 and i386 rpms from the above link.

You cannot just download the mono binary tarball; you must download the
libgdiplus one and install that first.

WARNING : If you install these packages, you may find code will fail - I
haven't found anything yet (nant, boo, monodevelop, gtk-sharp2 and quite
a lot of other test code works, and definitely much quicker!). DO NOT
REPORT BUGS INTO THE REDHAT BUGZILLA - you need to send them to
bugzilla.ximian.com.

NOTE FOR FC-5 users : Currently the FC-5 version of mono puts everything
in /usr/lib. FC-6 and rawhide use the correct lib for the architecture
(so lib64 is used for 64 bit). This may result in some instability with
mono applications. I cannot test to see if this is the case as I don't
have an FC-5 box.

Share and enjoy folks - share and enjoy!

TTFN

Paul
