Major highlights
=============

Version numbers
------------------------

Starting with this release, we are going to number our versions based
on the semver schema. (<A HREF="http://semver.org">http://semver.org</A>). We may not follow strictly
everything though. This is a work in progress.

This version was supposed to be a continuation of the 2.0.13 series as
we already have a 2.0.13 beta1 released. But we made so many changes
since the 2.0.13 that we decided to jump the version number to 2.1.

Entity Framework
--------------------------

We added initial support for Entity Framework 6.0. We isolated the
entity framework code in two other assemblies:
Npgsql.LegacyEntityFramework.dll and Npgsql.EntityFramework.dll. The
first one is for entity framework pre-6 version and the other one is
for entity framework 6.0 and above. This was needed in order to
facilitate the deployment and the code organization as the apis and
namespaces change a lot depending on the entity framework version.

Support for 6.0 isn't yet complete and is to be considered optional at
the moment. We will add better support in upcoming versions.

Fixed bugs:

[#28] [#1011338] Error in insert statement with new E6 version. Thanks cody82.
[#27] Fixed connecting to Postgresql using client certificates. Check

for more information. Thanks dreamlax

New features:

Add support for new error fields added in PostgreSQL 9.3. See here for
more information about those fields:
<A HREF="http://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commit;h=991f3e5ab3f8196d18d5b313c81a5f744f3baaea">http://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commit;h=991f3e5ab3f8196d18d5b313c81a5f744f3baaea</A>
Thanks David Rowley for patch.

Initial support for Entity Framework 6. See
<A HREF="http://fxjr.blogspot.com/2013/06/initial-ef-6-support-added-to-npgsql.html">http://fxjr.blogspot.com/2013/06/initial-ef-6-support-added-to-npgsql.html</A>
for more information about it.

[#30] Improved connection timeout handling. Thanks Glen Parker.

[#41], [#52], [#77], [#72], [#80] Huge internal query handling which
added a big performance boost for prepared statements and unprepared
statements as well. Binary parameter codec infrastructure has been
added, and several data types (currently bytea, text, boolean,
integers, and gloats) can now use PG's binary coded support, including
arrays of those types, which offers a dramatic performance boost for
parameter and result values in prepared statements. Previously we
didn't recommend using prepared statements with Npgsql, only for bytea
data types. Thanks to Glen Parker, this is now a thing of the past.

Huge directory and project structure. Npgsql had its project layout
restructured to easy management of different platforms Npgsql targets:
.net 2.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, entity framework prior 6.0, entity framework
after 6.0. Huge structure changes to our testsuite. Before, our tests
depended on an external script to setup database tables, now
everything is done inside the tests setup. Thanks Shay Rojansky.

[#74] Use new &quot;Discard all&quot; syntax when releasing connection from
pool. Thanks Chen Huajun.

New connection string parameter &quot;AlwaysPrepare&quot; to indicate to Npgsql
to always prepare statements before executing.

[#110] Added support for Entity Framework before version 6.0 and after
6.0. They are totally different things regarding APIs and namespaces.
Thanks Shay Rojansky and Kenji Uno.

Added nuget EFProvider installation. Thanks Shay Rojansky.

Added EF6 ConnectionFactory class. Thanks Shay Rojansky.

[#135] Fix for operators @@, @&gt; and &lt;@. Thanks Glen Parker and jjchiw.

[#117] Command timeout improvements. Thanks Glen Parker.

Final considerations:

This release wouldn't be possible without the help of two members:
Glen Parker and Shay Rojansky.

Glen Parker has been working in the optimizations tasks since his
first git commit. From the changelog you can see his tireless work
regarding each part of Npgsql which could be optimized. Thank you very
much for your contributions, Glen!

Shay Rojansky has been helping as the mastermind of the project
restructuring support. He contributed a lot of changes which made our
lives working with Npgsql much better. Thanks to him we can compile
Npgsql for different .net platform versions easily. He also got
TeamCity build server working as well as github integration. He helped
us to get EntityFramework pre-6 and pos-6 verions easily integrated.
Thank you, Shay!

I also would like to thank Dave Page who helped us with the server
where the TeamCity is installed. Without his help, I'm sure our
TeamCity installation would be much more difficult. Thank you, Dave!
