<PRE>[Intro: I'm somewhat new to C# and am much more familiar with Linux and MacOS than Windows. In the past few months I've been learning C# to develop Xamarin.iOS apps and simply trying to wrap my mind around this combination of C# and iOS stuff that doesn't always make sense to someone that's been doing command-line and server-side Unix, Python, and JavaScript stuff mostly.]

I've been asked to fix, update and make portable an app build around Microsoft.Reporting.WinForms. From searching I see a bunch of old posts saying that Mono doesn't support WinForms but nothing very recent. I don't really know much about it so my basic question is if there is an easy fix (add the needed assembly somewhere) and if not what is the recommended way to handle porting?

I had nothing to do with writing this app and it's fairly large, complex, and seems poorly written but as much as I'd like to do a total remit it's probably not the best strategy at the moment.
