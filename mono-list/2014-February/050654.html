<PRE>Greetings,

I am evaluating using MonoDevelop for Client/Server application development.

My primary development environment will be Xubuntu LTS editions, latest
stable.

I am wondering the status of the Basic support within MonoDevelop... such as
may all of the GUI development capabilities/tools for C# be used for Basic,
or is there a lag that Basic is catching up with C#?

A major corporate size client commissioned me to develop an ERP / Business
Intelligence application for them. The client group specified Access (2007,
later added 2010) and the corporate IT group specified SQL Serer 2008.

I pushed Access to the extreme as a Client/Server development tool. I double
class-wrapped all forms to database. Class layer one is a DB object class
which provides a consistent public interface to SELECT / INSERT / UPDATE /
etc... calls the correct Stored Procedure via ADO.Command / ADO.Parameter
type VB code, and populates class methods. The second layer of classes I
call the Validation classes which performs mapping between the DB object and
the form controls. Those classes perform data validation after all screen
controls have been read, and prior to sending data to the DB object. If any
field(s) are found to have an invalid value, they are indicated and no DB
operation is performed. If all field(s) are valid, then field values are
shuffled to the DB object and the correct DB call is issued.

Total client and application server tier code was over 125,000 LOC's, and in
excess of 260 Stored Procedures on the SQL BE DB. Pretty slick little ERP /
BI application.

I fear that C# will be too verbose in syntax / not productive and efficient
enough, so wish to see if the Mono Basic support lags at all behind the
primary language C#.

I said Primary is Xubuntu. Target platforms will include Windows at first,
perhaps others later. So I would need to understand the Windows run-time
requirements. I hope to be able to build without any use of paid license
software... aka VisualStudio. Will this be possible targeting a Windows
run-time platform? Thank you.

Blessings,
Michael Lueck
