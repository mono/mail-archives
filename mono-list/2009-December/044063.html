The thing is that most Mono developers and users aren't very interested in
Windows.Forms. Most of them use GTK# or other GUI, while WinForms is mostly
seen as something to increase compatibility with existing .NET applications,
not something to write new apps in (especially if Linux is your primary
target). Also, the fact that WinForms is not only old but also proprietary
(hasn't been opened / standardized by Microsoft) probably doesn't help
either.

I may be wrong, but I think there is only one Novell developer actively
working on WinForms support (Carlos Alberto Cortez), plus benevolent
contributors. Add to that the fact the WinForms implementation of Mono has
been restarted from scratch twice already
(<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/WinForms#History">http://www.mono-project.com/WinForms#History</A>), and you understand why it's
still not mature... but it's still getting better, slowly but surely.

Anyway, people who care about WinForms (I do) should submit bug reports and
patches to help.
