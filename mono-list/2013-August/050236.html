<PRE>Hello everyone,

clients/servers for linux and Mac  

it would be nice if a mono developer join mediabrowser3 and make this
reality as there is huge dmanad of linux applications and future is bright 

so here is little summary so everyone understand what MediaBrowser3 is :

Media Browser Server:
Media Browser 3 is a centralized solution. Maintain your library just once
no matter how many devices you have accessing it. Manage plug-ins and
everything else in one place for your whole home &#8211; all with a sophisticated
but dead-easy-to-use web configuration platform.

Media Browser Theater
A completely new stand-alone client with embedded VLC player brings Media
Browser to places it could never go before!

your media with you wherever you go.

there too: CoverArt, TrakT, GameBrowser, Video Backdrops, Trailers and more&#8230;
*
Media Browser Classic
This is the new Media Center client for MB3. It looks and behaves much like
the old MB 2.x and still relies on WMC for its presentation and playback. If
you are coming from MB 2 and like or need WMC for its other features, this
client will allow you to stay in that environment.
*
The Dashboard
The Dashboard is the new web-based configuration interface for Media Browser
Server. It is a centralized hub for configuring your library, user profiles,
metadata options, plug-ins, etc. Being web-based, it is accessible from many
different platforms including mobile phones and tablets.
*

MB 3. This client gives you a very rich interface into your media library
including advanced views and searching capability.

your collection and then tell some of the other clients to actually play the
items.
