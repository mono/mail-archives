<PRE>&gt;<i> I had opened up a single connection, and was doing updates/selects through
</I>&gt;<i> that. I ended up with &quot;library sequence out of error&quot; exceptions. So, I
</I>
I do this by caching one connection per thread.

&gt;<i> modified the code such that each query will open up new connection, and then
</I>&gt;<i> run itself. So, &quot;library sequence&quot; exceptions went away, but got overtaken
</I>&gt;<i> by &quot;database locked&quot; ones. So, to do synchronization at the application
</I>
Try specifying the Timeout for the connection. I set it to 30seconds,
which is enough for my application. I don't know any other solution
for this issue - probably the best would be to set timeout to
infinite, which I will do by increasing the actual value when needed
;)

def conn = SqliteConnection ($&quot;URI=<A HREF="file://$path,Version=3,busy_timeout=30000&quot;">file://$path,Version=3,busy_timeout=30000&quot;</A>);

(this works with the old provider)

&gt;<i> level, I've set the C# locking mechanism to such that
</I>&gt;<i> 1. each table only runs one query at a time, and
</I>&gt;<i> 2. only one write query is being run at a time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, all this has done is just to _reduce_ the number of database locked
</I>
I think you cannot even do concurrent reads or maybe there is some
place you missed in locking, I'm not sure.

&gt;<i> exceptions. I'm still getting them. Is there a way by which they can be
</I>&gt;<i> eliminated? Mono database page shows that we can use the new library
</I>&gt;<i> System.Data.Sqlite, which is version 3 and apparently doesn't have these
</I>&gt;<i> synchronization issues. However, I've been unable to find the .dll for
</I>&gt;<i> linux. Any help is appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think I found them at
<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/download-stable/sles-9-i586/">http://www.go-mono.com/download-stable/sles-9-i586/</A>  or maybe I just
compiled them from source... it's quite easy.
However I experienced a strange (dead) locking issues using the new
provider, which the same code works fine with old provider. I still
don't have time to investigate, but it would be great if somebody else
having concurrent app with sqlite tested it with new provider :D
