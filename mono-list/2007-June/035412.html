Security is just one aspect of .NET. Incidentally one that isn't even
(completely) implemented in Mono.

A JIT compiler like Mono is generating native code per definition.
The only difference to native binaries is the lack of those ;-)

&gt;<i> Given the presence of X Windows (and the ability to write X Windows with the

Mono is using these native libraries.

Nobody sells you these claims, so there is no need to buy them.

BTW, do your C++Builder and Delphi executables run unchanged on Unix
and Windows? Is Kylix still supported? Does it run on, say, Solaris
or Linux/AMD64 or MacOS/PPC? No way.
