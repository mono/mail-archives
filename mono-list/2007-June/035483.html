<PRE>If the string argument is mutable then I believe one should use a
StringBuilder -- with its capacity set, and that length passed to the
native function too.  And if the native method writes more chars than
allocated then the heap will be corrupted. :-(
 
So with native method:
    void my_function(unsigned short* myArg, int maxLen); 
 
Do 
    [DllImport(&quot;myCLib&quot;, CharSet=CharSet.Unicode)]
    // I think &lt;CharSet&gt; on that attr is enough, no need for MarshalAs
on the param...
    public static extern void my_function(StringBuilder myArg, int
maxLength); 
...
    StringBuilder bldr = new StringBuilder(256);
    NativeMethods.my_function(bldr, bldr.Capacity);

See a similar sample at
&lt;<A HREF="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x3txb6xc(vs.80">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x3txb6xc(vs.80</A>).aspx&gt;
<A HREF="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x3txb6xc(vs.80">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x3txb6xc(vs.80</A>).aspx, and
reference material at
&lt;<A HREF="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/s9ts558h(VS.80">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/s9ts558h(VS.80</A>).aspx&gt;

Unless I'm much confused it shouldn't work (at least isn't guaranteed
to) on MSFT either: &quot;Platform invoke copies string arguments, converting
from the .NET Framework format (Unicode) to the platform unmanaged
format. Strings are immutable and are not copied back from unmanaged
memory to managed memory when the call returns.&quot;

I suppose since it is Unicode on both sides the MSFT CLR skips the copy
and just passed the address of the String's content.  Whereas Mono
doesn't have that optimisation perhaps.

Does that solve it, or is something else the problem?

Andy

Subject: Re: [Mono-list] Trouble with utf-16 marshaling


   I have debugged this some more, and found this.  (I'm not yet sure
how to convert this information into something actionable).
 
I was browsing some of the mono source code and found this function (and
its sisters):
      MonoString* mono_string_new_utf16 (MonoDomain *domain, const
guint16 *text, gint32 len);
 
which seem to be the function(s) that initialize internal C# strings
from C data.  This one in particular appears to be invoked when internal
C# strings are created from UTF-16 &quot;C&quot; data.   I hacked in a simple loop
that printf'd the hex values of the UTF-16 data (the 'text' parameter).
 
  What I see in my console window is interesting.  (After a bunch of
unrelated stuff) I see my C library returning a UTF-16 string that gets
correctly interpreted as MonoString:
 
    DBG: invocation of mono_string_new_utf16 with data:
                   002f  0068  006f  006d  0065  002f  0064  0061  006e
006d  002f  0069  006e  0074 ...
 
which is the correct string.  The next thing I see in the console window
is this:
 

    DBG: invocation of mono_string_new_utf16 with data:
                   682f  6d6f  2f65  6164  6d6e  692f  746e''
 
Notice that this second data is similiar to the first where each 2-bytes
in the second string is the corresponding *4* bytes of the first string
and re-ordered as if there were some endian issue.  Clearly this second
string is supposed to be the same as the first string but it's been
damaged by some translation process.
 
   Does that information mean anything to anyone?   As always, thanks
for any help.
        Dan Maser.

   Furthermore, I see in the mono source code that there is a test
function in the mono/mono/tests/libtest.c
 
STDCALL unsigned short*
test_lpwstr_marshal (unsigned short* chars, long length)
{
...
}
 
   Which is basically the same thing I'm doing; further indicating that
this should work.

Subject: [Mono-list] Trouble with utf-16 marshaling




   My situation is this:  I've got a C library that has a lot of UTF-16
inputs and outputs.  The C type is always &quot;unsigned short*&quot; or &quot;const
unsigned short*&quot; (because clearly wchar_t* isn't portable because it's 4
bytes on linux).   All of my C# code has the
&quot;[MarshalAs(UnsignedType.LPWStr)]&quot; attribute specified.

   It works properly in windows with MS .NET, but doesn't work for me in
linux with mono.   I've verified in gdb that the C library is returning
the correct string, but immediately after the C dll returns and mono
does the LPWStr marshaling the string is total garbage characters.   I
am under the impression from previous posts that 2-byte UTF-16 should
marshal properly to mono with the LPWStr attribute.  In fact it looks
like some of the gdiplus calls use that same thing and work. any ideas
what I can check on because mine doesn't?

   For more clarification my C library has a function signature like
this: 

void my_function(unsigned short* myArg); 

    And my C# code looks like this: 


[DllImport(&quot;myCLib&quot;)] 
public static extern void my_function([MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPWStr)]
string myArg); 

   Thanks in advance for any ideas on what to check!
