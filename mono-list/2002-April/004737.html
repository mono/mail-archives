<PRE>&gt;<i> Microsoft can't just make Samba illegal... can they?
</I>&gt;<i> Are they saying that no one can use Samba ever again?  I can't believe
</I>&gt;<i> that such a license is possible.
</I>
It is, since Microsoft does own the patents. This is the very reason that
free software organizations frown on patents; their express purpose is to
grant the owner &quot;the right to exclude others from making, using, offering
for sale, or selling&quot; the patented invention.

I've noticed this is part of a recent trend of gleeful revenge from
Microsoft. When Sun prevented Microsoft from shipping new versions of the
Java runtime with Windows, Microsoft countered by not including a Java
runtime at all. It's dirty, but you have to admit, Sun did get what it asked
for. Now the states want Microsoft to license its proprietary technology to
competitors, and so Microsoft will comply, but with its own retaliatory
twist. The states are getting what they asked for -- just not what they
intended.

It's brilliant. Devious and twisted, but brilliant.

For its own sake, Samba can still switch licenses. I hear X11 is popular
these days...  :P
