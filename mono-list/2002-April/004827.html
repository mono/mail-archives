Well I really don't see how this license can apply to CIFS.. it is not included with Windows, and this obviously doesn't apply to that implimentation. 

Another thing I can't figure out is what patents the license is talking
about. All Samba does is impliment an API spec. You can't patent an API,
it's not an invention. You could copywright one for sure, but as I said,
even a copywrighted API needs to be interoperable according to the DMCA.
If the patents refer to Microsofts implimentations of the CIFS spec,
then it is valid. but since the Samba team rarely uses the microsoft
implimentations at all and does it from scratch (why do you think Samba
outperforms NT for SMB servers :) I can't see how it would affect them.
