</I>
I committed to cvs a fix for these two issues.

&gt;<i> ./io-layer/atomic.c :

</I>
I filed bug#24002 for this one.

&gt;<i> After these hacks, I did configure, make, make install.  Lots and lots

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>          warning: cast increases required alignment of target type
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> as well as some :
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	 warning: comparison is always false due to limited range of data type
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Q : I *think* the first one is just warning about wasted space, since

</I>
It should not be a problem, since we take care of aligning things
properly.

&gt;<i> and I got the following :
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    (1024) Entering System.Threading.Thread::.cctor ()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      (1024) Entering System.Collections.Hashtable::.cctor ()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        (1024) Entering System.Object::.ctor (0x20bd938 )
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        (1024) Leaving System.Object::.ctor =&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        (1024) Entering System.Runtime.CompilerServices.RuntimeHelpers::InitializeArray ([0x20c16b8] [vt: 0xbffff7b8] )
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  0x20c3038:	e1a0c00d	mov	ip, sp
</I>[...]

</I>&gt;<i> my question is :
</I>
Well, the method that crashes is not a normal method: it's an
internalcall and requires some asm support code to call the C function
that implements it.

&gt;<i> Q: Should mint be close to running on the StrongARM (or any ARM) or is
</I>&gt;<i> there still lots of work to be done ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If there is a simple fix to get mint working, I'd love to hear about
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>
The fix to get the sample working may be simple, but you need to
put yourself in debug mode and learn a bit of ARM assembly to track down
the issue:-)
You can start from mono/arch/arm/tramp.c and get mono_create_trampoline()
to support all the method signatures needed to run a basic example.
Unfortunately, the barrier to entry for porters is higher now than it
was a few months ago, since the interp initializes some runtime
subsystems before running the Main() method of a program and that
requires a working trampoline support, at least for some simple methods.
You may also try to remove the call to mono_thread_init (domain);
in interpreter/interp.c and see if you get any further.
