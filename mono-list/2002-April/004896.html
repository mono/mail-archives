Hi!

sorry for the late answer. I just came back from Spain yesterday at
11:30 pm.

&gt;<i> Hello Christian,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    It was great meeting you at GUADEC.  I think we should have had a
</I>&gt;<i> Mono BOF, but it was too late by the time I thought of it ;-(
</I>
Yeah. That would have been great.
 
&gt;<i>    Anyways, here are my thoughts:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	* gdk-pixbuf is a generic image loader that loads an image
</I>&gt;<i> 	  and leaves it into an RGB buffer.  It hides all the details
</I>&gt;<i> 	  about what image file format is being loaded.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	* Libart is a general framework for rendering RGB/RGBA buffers
</I>&gt;<i> 	  into RGB buffers and rendering postscript-like paths into
</I>&gt;<i> 	  RGB/RGBA buffers.
</I>
OK, sounds easy.
 
&gt;<i>    So we want to use gdk-pixbuf as the image loader for the image
</I>&gt;<i> classes, and then we need operations to render that into the windowing
</I>&gt;<i> system (Gtk+, MacOS, etc).  But notice how there is very little
</I>&gt;<i> dependnecies in Gdk-pixbuf on gtk, and libart has none.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    They are pretty independent from a windowing system (gdk-pixbuf comes
</I>&gt;<i> with some &quot;helper&quot; routines for rendering data into a pixmap and to load
</I>&gt;<i> pixmaps into RGB buffers).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    A few things to keep in mind:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	* gdk-pixbuf can be used to load images for Gtk+, MacOS X and 	 
</I>&gt;<i> Windows, it should be pretty portable, although we might need
</I>&gt;<i> 	  in the future to back-port some new features from Gtk head. 
</I>&gt;<i> 	  Lets talk to Federico about this, and get a status report.
</I>
OK.

&gt;<i> 	* Libart is probably only going to be used with X11, as the
</I>&gt;<i> 	  MacOS X provides the same features in Quartz, and Win32
</I>&gt;<i> 	  *probably* has that in GDI+.  If not, we should use libart
</I>&gt;<i> 	  in Win32 as well (or for older Windows systems).
</I>
Sounds like that this will be the most diffcult part. How can we find
out if GDI+ has that feature?

&gt;<i> * Directory Layout
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    My suggestion is to have:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	System.Drawing 	(assembly directory)
</I>&gt;<i> 		System.Drawing.Blah
</I>&gt;<i> 			Common code for &quot;Blah&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 			Stubs for &quot;Blah&quot; to ease ports.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 		Gtk
</I>&gt;<i> 			System.Drawing.Blah.
</I>&gt;<i> 				Gtk ports of &quot;System.Drawing.Blah&quot;
</I>
Wouldn't it be better to say Linux instead of Gtk?!

&gt;<i> 		MacOS
</I>&gt;<i> 			System.Drawing.Blah
</I>&gt;<i> 				MacOS ports of &quot;System.Drawing.Blah&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 		Win32
</I>&gt;<i> 			System.Drawing.Blah
</I>&gt;<i> 				Win32 ports of &quot;System.Drawing.Blah&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Then we use nant targets to include/exclude the right set of files
</I>&gt;<i> to create the assembly.
</I>
aha. OK.
 
&gt;<i> * Open questions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     I believe that the graphics contexts that are used to render can
</I>&gt;<i> accept either libart-like rendering operations and X11-like rendering
</I>&gt;<i> operations.  This complicates matters, but I am not sure.  Someone needs
</I>&gt;<i> to investigate this.
</I>
eeeeeek. This seems to be even more complicated. I don't know anything
about those things.
Another thing is that university will start on monday and I won't have
much time for looking closer at that kind of stuff. Does anybody
volunteer?

Greetings and thanks for the explanations.
Christian
