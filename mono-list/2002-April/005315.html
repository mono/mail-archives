Gtk+ also has the GtkFixed widget which allows explicit positioning of
widgets.  Of course, fixed position layout sucks, but that's a moot
point based on the vastness of the hordes that will be developing for
SWF.  

People developing for mono will have the advantage of using the Gtk# API
directly, with built-in portability to win32.  But we should still be
able to provide a &quot;Form&quot; widget with position based layout by packing a
GtkFixed in a GtkWindow.

Where it will get interesting is mapping anchoring onto Gtk, because it
brings all the baggage of fixed positioning along for the ride with
dynamic resizing. 

It will be a challenge to map SWF's layout mechanism onto Gtk, but I'm
sure we (and Gtk) are up to the challenge.
