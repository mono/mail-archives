<PRE>&gt;<i> Would you be able to use this framework to build DOS applications? That way I could create my own small OS if I wanted to. It would be excellent for computers dedicated to 1 or 2 specific tasks, you just write your own single application to run on the computer and because it's .NET it would be so easy to do.
</I>
You might be able to, but Mono does assume in quite a number of places
that you have a 32-bit address space.  If you can get your x86 cpu to
run in 32-bit mode with a DOS extender you would be fine.

The problem is not related to memory requirements but to the horrible
default x86 segmentation memory model. 

You could remove this limitation, but we are unlikely to fold these
changes back if they change in any way the assumed 32-bit programming
model.

Miguel.
