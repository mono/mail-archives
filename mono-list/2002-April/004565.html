<PRE>csc.exe is the Microsoft C# compiler.  Since, mcs (that is mono's C# 
compiler) is itself written in C#, you'll need to compile it with csc.exe or 
a prebuilt binary of mcs.  Make sense?  To get csc.exe you'll need to 
download and install Microsoft's .NET SDK. The only other alternative is to 
download Mono 0.10 and follow the instructions for compiling mcs.  Note: you 
will have to have csc.exe to compile Mono's class library regardless, as mcs 
is not capable of this quite yet.

Hope this helps,

Adam
