<PRE>Hi

SharpDevelop .88 released

+ Code completion
+ Class browser
+ New VS.NET like layout
+ Support for Windows, Unix, Macintosh line terminator styles.
+ Many bugfixes and smaller improvements

A new testing framework, named SharpUnit (#Unit), is included. Its features
are:

 + SharpUnit provides an easy to use, powerful testing framework for
developers.
 + SharpUnit is capable of testing multi-assembly projects (#Unit is the
    only .NET unit testing framework capable of testing #develop)
 + Tests can be written in any language which runs under .NET
 + SharpUnit provides an easy to use GUI
 + A test manifest for dependent assemblies can be defined, no restriction
on
    the location on disk.
 + Unit tests can be built without requiring special inheritance, therefore
    you can test protected members of your classes

The framework and tools can be used independent of SharpDevelop and there
will be a separate download for #Unit too in the near future.

cya
