<PRE>wow - it would be great to have the JIT working on MS.

We have to do a major cleanup as soon as the JIT is feature complete. I
suggest that we do that split when we do that cleanup.

Is it really necessary do to that renaming. I would prefer to simply
copy the Win32 CONTEXT to a POSIX like context. That way we do not need
macros, which are quite confusing IMO. Performance does not matter in
case of exceptions.

&gt;<i> Some code is commented out to avoid abnormal termination if corlib is out of

</I>&gt;<i> Win32 code uses per-process exception handler to catch exceptions.
</I>
I would like to include that code as soon as the above issue is fixed.
