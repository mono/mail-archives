OK, I get the idea -- Mono has nothing political in motives. Unfortunately
for you, Free Software Movement was more of an ethical and political movement. 
So, this is not the Free Software that I believe in . I am in the wrong place 
&lt;PERIOD&gt;. Gimme time to pack my bags.

&gt;<i> I just do not care.  If you do continue with this behavior, I will ask
</I>&gt;<i> you to leave.

I didn't come here to spam,flame or flamebait, and none of what I posted 
is of that category. All the ideological mails were after you announced 
the &quot;Mono-hackers&quot; as the &quot;technical&quot; list. So I can find no fault in
what I have done.

But most people here are not in my wavelength and that is the cause of 
the high &quot;noise to signal ratio&quot; -- just plain interference. So I'll 
be keeping my opinions to myself (as nobody cares). 

I'm not interested in a reply on this -- so please don't take the trouble.

All other free software advocates, please refrain from making my 
*mistake* of speaking out loud.
