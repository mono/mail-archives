I understood the Microsoft (that's an s, not a dollar sign) license very
well. Perhaps you should review section 2 of the GPL:

&quot;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole ... When you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the
Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,
whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus
to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.&quot;

Derivative and collective works containing GPL-licensed works must be
licensed under the GPL. This is one of the _major_ restrictions of the GPL,
and one of the reasons I personally don't like the license. The LGPL is my
favorite of the free software licenses.
