<PRE>Hello Christian,

   It was great meeting you at GUADEC.  I think we should have had a
Mono BOF, but it was too late by the time I thought of it ;-(

   Anyways, here are my thoughts:

	* gdk-pixbuf is a generic image loader that loads an image
	  and leaves it into an RGB buffer.  It hides all the details
	  about what image file format is being loaded.

	* Libart is a general framework for rendering RGB/RGBA buffers
	  into RGB buffers and rendering postscript-like paths into
	  RGB/RGBA buffers.

   So we want to use gdk-pixbuf as the image loader for the image
classes, and then we need operations to render that into the windowing
system (Gtk+, MacOS, etc).  But notice how there is very little
dependnecies in Gdk-pixbuf on gtk, and libart has none.

   They are pretty independent from a windowing system (gdk-pixbuf comes
with some &quot;helper&quot; routines for rendering data into a pixmap and to load
pixmaps into RGB buffers).

   A few things to keep in mind:

	* gdk-pixbuf can be used to load images for Gtk+, MacOS X and 	 
Windows, it should be pretty portable, although we might need
	  in the future to back-port some new features from Gtk head. 
	  Lets talk to Federico about this, and get a status report.

	* Libart is probably only going to be used with X11, as the
	  MacOS X provides the same features in Quartz, and Win32
	  *probably* has that in GDI+.  If not, we should use libart
	  in Win32 as well (or for older Windows systems).

* Directory Layout

   My suggestion is to have:

	System.Drawing 	(assembly directory)
		System.Drawing.Blah
			Common code for &quot;Blah&quot;
			Stubs for &quot;Blah&quot; to ease ports.

		Gtk
			System.Drawing.Blah.
				Gtk ports of &quot;System.Drawing.Blah&quot;
		MacOS
			System.Drawing.Blah
				MacOS ports of &quot;System.Drawing.Blah&quot;
		Win32
			System.Drawing.Blah
				Win32 ports of &quot;System.Drawing.Blah&quot;

    Then we use nant targets to include/exclude the right set of files
to create the assembly.

* Open questions:

    I believe that the graphics contexts that are used to render can
accept either libart-like rendering operations and X11-like rendering
operations.  This complicates matters, but I am not sure.  Someone needs
to investigate this.
			
Miguel.
