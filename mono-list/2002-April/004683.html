Ok, we don't null-pad the section data. I'll cook up a patch for this
problem now. In the meantime, you can try appending a few bytes from
/dev/zero to the file and check if you get any other errors.

&gt;<i> One thing I did notice is that Rotor goes into this section over and over
</I>&gt;<i> again throughout the execution of the Rotor-generated PE file for
</I>&gt;<i> seemingly no reason (that I can see, yet, that is). I would think

Well, I guess they couldn't make a version of the CLR on BSD faster than
the windows one, so they slowed it down somewhat :-) (note for the joke
impaired: I'm just making fun of it, no conspiracy theories, please).

&gt;<i> thing that I have no explanation for is that the MCS-generated code has a
</I>&gt;<i> value of 1 for NumberOfSections, but the Rotor-generated PE file always
</I>&gt;<i> has a value of 2 for that same field. That routine is entered 530 times in
</I>
I guess their second section is a .rsrc one? We don't write one, yet,
but simple programs don't need it.

&gt;<i> P.S. It would be very helpful if you could just point me straight to the
</I>&gt;<i> section of code in Mono that is responsible for generating the PE
</I>&gt;<i> header, so I wouldn't have to spend a lot of time looking for it :) This
</I>&gt;<i> way, I can reference sections of Mono's code and the things it needs,
</I>&gt;<i> rather than beating around the bush, trying not to mention too much of
</I>&gt;<i> Rotor's internals. Thanks again!!
</I>
You can check mono/mono/metadata/reflection.c: the function
mono_image_get_header () creates the PE/COFF header.

Thanks for your help!
