</I>
Yes and no.
You can make a library in one language and use it on another, *HOWEVER*,
you need to create a *binding* (some soft of &quot;glue work&quot;) to make that
happen.

You must create a binding for each and every language that you want to
acces the library.

What makes .NET different is that this would not be necessary.  All
languages would be compiled to a bytecode and they could use components
from each other without having to build bindings.

This is actually the very reason why Mono exists.  One of the good things
about the Ximan Gnome desktop is that it offers bindings for many
languges.  However, it is very difficult to maintain all those bindings,
and that slows down development.

One of Migel's objectives in making Mono was to bypass the cost of
maintaining those bindings.  All the code would be compile to the IL
(Intermediate Language) and we would get multiple-language support without
the cost of maintaining bindings.


This then, answers your other question:  Yes, Mono is definitelly planning
on supporting more languages eventually.  That's the whole idea.


I hope this helps,
Daniel.
