I'm a really sick, twisted person.

So, over the past few days, my research has been dictated by slow
equlibrium processes, so I've decided to code some C#.  Good idea, I
thought, since Miguel wants demo material for whatever conference that
is.

Of course, this comes from the tourmented mind that brings you new
Imlib1 releases.  Doing some web app isn't &quot;good&quot; enough for me...it
had to be something that would cause people to ponder whether or not I
should be in a padded cell.

So I ported JOrbis to C#.

That's right, we now have a C# implementation of an OGG bitstream
parser and a Vorbis codec.

What's worse...it works extremely well in the MS runtime.  It causes
the mono JIT to choke (see bug #23846).  The code is also somewhat
ugly, I've had to fix some of the Java constructs over to C# (namely
the pseudo Java &quot;goto&quot;s...ever see Fortran ported to C ported to Java
before....if you haven't...).  Some things with casting should really
be fixed, and I need to fix all the synchronized() issues...I just
kinda left those out or pseudo-faked them with bad lock(this)
constructs.

Speed isn't that great.  In a vmware process on my dual MP 1900+, I can
deocde a 6 minute song in 50 seconds.  Not as fast as a native C
version (order 10 seconds), but still faster than realtime.

I'll try to get it into a public CVS server as soon as some of the
warts are removed.  But, hey, for demo material, there's nothing better
than blaring some 2112 across a conference room...(1)

Take care,
Mark Crichton

(1) Well maybe there is, but I doubt there are a lot of people familiar
with the Indianapolis punk scene....
