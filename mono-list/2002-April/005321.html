Cool.

&gt;<i> ./io-layer/atomic.c :

</I>
The C versions are *not* atomic - they are workarounds for other platforms
until atomic versions (probably in assembly) are written.  The spinlocks
are what is keeping the code vaguely atomic so long as all accesses to
the variables in question go through the Interlocked*() functions.

The way to fix it would be either a) write the inline assembly versions
for arm (the preferred option) or b) replace the spinlocks with mutexes
(or c) ignore it for now and hope the problem goes away :) ).

&gt;<i>

</I>
ARM has been looked at by Serge (I think he was concentrating on wince
though).  As it happens, I ordered a Zaurus recently myself to play about
on with mono :)

Me too...
