That's right. The runtime is now passing a UTF-16 string to a function that
expects ASCII. So instead of looking for &quot;hello.cs&quot;, it's probably looking for
a file called &quot;h&quot;.

&gt;<i> What about removing unicode completely in mono? What consequences would this

</I>
At some point or other we have to deal with unicode strings. The wise people at
ECMA and Microsoft say so. These days it seems there are still some people in
the world that insist on using incomprehensible squiggles as their alphabet.
;-)

The .NET library character support is all based on UTF-16. My personal favorite
idea is to wrap the routines we have in a clean mono host api that accepts
null-terminated UTF-16 strings as standard, and then maps this to either UTF-8,
ASCII or leaves it as is depending on the underlying host.

Try to look on the bright side. When we get this sorted you'll be able to name
all your files in Tengwar :-)

Dan.
