Mono-0.10 is pretty much out of date (already!).  Your best bet is probably
the daily snapshots from <A HREF="http://mono.baselabs.org">http://mono.baselabs.org</A>

That shouldnt happen.  The precompiled pkgconfig that the script installs
works out the real prefix (overriding /target) by checking the directory
that the pkg-config binary is running from.

netdb.h doesnt exist in the mingw windows headers that we compile with.  If
configure found it, you broke something.

The answer really is to use the script until you are sure that you can
build it by hand and get it right.
