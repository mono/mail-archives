<PRE>&gt;<i> i-cache flushing is processor-specific, it doesn't depend on the OS
</I>
Yes, it's surely processor specific, but some OSes have API for this.
Say Windows has FlushInstructionCache API. So for some OSes it could be
coded only once for all archs.
So idea is to somehow separate these parts from the code that uses it.
Sure, this and other things can be ifdefed but it seems that it may become a
problem with the time.
It depends on the number of systems that will be supported in the future.
Even now, with basically two systems supported we have that Unicode problem.
Or for example, exceptions are both OS and arch-dependent.
So it looks like os, arch and os-arch modules ;-)

Anyhow, I really like Dan's host API idea.

Generally, I think the scope of the host API is even wider.
Say, some embedded systems have utility code such as lists and hashtables
built-in. Reusing this code in such systems is critical due to limited
resources. Same for Unicode support.

Well, I realize that it's easier said than done, so just thinking out loud
;-)
