&gt;<i>  There you will see that Carbon is really intended for

</I>&gt;<i>  Cocoa is for new code.  Cocoa is a higher level framework,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I digress... we need to use Quartz and Cocoa to implement

</I>&gt;<i>  legacy code anyway =)
</I>
It's true that Carbon was created for the benefit of legacy code, but 
I'm not sure it should be dismissed it out of hand.  Carbon exists, 
it works, and it's likely to be supported for a very long time (since 
many of the major OS X applications are based on it).  So, if it's 
easier to write Windows.Forms on top of Carbon than Cocoa, then 
Carbon may be the better choice.

Here are the issues as I see them:

1. Cocoa is the older, more mature framework, and one gets the sense 
that Apple &quot;likes it better&quot;.  All other things being equal, Cocoa is 
probably the framework of choice.  However, I think it's easy to 
overstate this.  Carbon is well supported, and (as noted above) is 
likely to remain so.

2. There is a general impression that Cocoa applications act &quot;more 
native&quot; than Carbon applications, with better adherence to the Mac OS 
X UI guidelines, better performance, etc.  However, I've never heard 
a solid reason given for this.  I suspect that it's partly a false 
perception, caused by the fact that most Cocoa applications were 
written with Mac OS X in mind, while most Carbon applications are 
ports.  However, there may be some truth here.

3. Carbon can be used in C++; Cocoa requires C (or Objective C). 
This is not a huge issue (it can be eliminated with glue code, and 
some people prefer C anyway), but it's an issue.

4. There is an impression that Cocoa is &quot;higher level&quot; than Carbon, 
which could be good (a more powerful toolkit) or bad (dictates too 
much behavior to allow implementing Windows Forms correctly).  I 
don't know enough about Cocoa to evaluate this, but it should be 
taken seriously.  I have experience with emulating one application 
framework on top of another, and it can be extremely difficult to do 
this well if the target framework is &quot;too high level&quot;.  It would be a 
real shame to go down the road of implementing Windows.Forms on Cocoa 
and later discover that it can't be done well.

It would be very useful to &quot;test the waters&quot;, by writing a simple 
Cocoa application (in C, Objective C, or Java) that implements a 
subset of Windows.Forms as an internal API.  Also, someone should 
talk to the Eclipse team to find out specifically what problems they 
had porting SWT to Cocoa.

I don't claim to derive a conclusion from this, I'm just trying to 
lay out the issues.  Is this list complete?  Is it correct?  If so, 
then we can discuss the relative weight of each issue.  If not, 
please help me complete it.
