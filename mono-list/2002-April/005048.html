<PRE>We are still a long ways from bringing Windows.Forms to OSX.
We do not yet have any implementation of Windows.Forms at all.  Right now,
we are simply making stubbs so that an implementation can be done later.

On the other hand, it's certainly not too late to express your thoughts.

Mono is moving fast, so stay tunned.
Maybe you can help us there sooner!

Cheers,
Daniel.

</I>&gt;<i> mapping SWT's event model to Cocoa. Although I have not yet used it, I
</I>&gt;<i> imagine that the Windows.Forms event model is similar, since I understand
</I>&gt;<i> that it provides low-level access to the system event loop. There were also
</I>&gt;<i> some other issues. A port of Windows.Forms to OSX using Cocoa could face
</I>&gt;<i> similar challenges.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally, Cocoa applications are written either in Objective-C or in

</I>&gt;<i> issue for Mono - not having seen any of the source code yet, I don't know
</I>&gt;<i> how it is being implemented under the hood.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, it seems like it might be worth considering using Carbon. Thoughts?
