<PRE>Here my mail comes again, Miguel. I forgot to post the mail to the list,
sorry.

Yes, it's free, too. (BSD-style)
The source is included in the package

We should make a link to it. The reasons why I choose Oberon over CP:

- CP seems to be more complex: It has a lot of files and many lines of code.
Oberon has only 3 (small) files oberon code --&gt; It will be easier to get the
oberon compiler hosted on mono.

- I'm not sure about this, but I think CP uses special wrapper (in
lib/NetSystem folder) to the framework.
(e.g mscorlib_system). That could mean problems with additional mono
classes.

PS: The languages-page is removed from the homepage (?)
