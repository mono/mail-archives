<PRE>/3.2 Patent License. Subject to Sections 3.3 - 3.7, Microsoft hereby 
grants Company a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, personal, 
transferable, non-sublicensable, license under its Necessary Claims to 
(1) make, use, import, and (2) offer to sell, sell and distribute, 
directly or indirectly, to End Users, Company Implementations that fully 
comply with the Technical Reference. The above license is limited to 
implementing the CIFS communication protocol itself, and does not 
include any express or implied licenses or other rights to any 
underlying technology (operating system technology, local file system 
technology, etc.) that may be used to make a complete file server or 
other CIFS compatible device./

This whole document is a LICENSE. The claims in section 3.2 are only 
vaild if you recieved and read the Technical Reference in the first 
place. If you never read or recieved the Technical Reference, then you 
never agreed to this license. Therefore producing implimentations 
compatable with said reference does not break any laws. Since the Samba 
project has pretty much been reverse-engineering everything themselves 
form the get-go anyway, mainly because MS doesn't follow their own 
specs, this is not a big problem. Not that it wa sibn the first place, 
since the Samba project is european in origion (I believe?) and software 
patents are not valid in Europe.

As for the DMCA, I would suggest you read it, yourself, it is not that 
long. But the jist of the clause is that you must by law allow others to 
interoperate with your products, ie  you can't lock people out of 
competing with you.
