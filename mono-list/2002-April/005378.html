Thanks for the info, very interesting!

Can you post a link to the sources of these programs, so that we can
extract a test case for the bug? Thanks!

&gt;<i> Then, to get an impression of the MCS compiler, I tried to recompile both

</I>&gt;<i> errors).  With littlest, it detects some compiler errors.

As above, if you post the sources we can add a proper bug report to our
bug tracking system (or you may do it yourself at <A HREF="http://bugzilla.ximian.com">http://bugzilla.ximian.com</A>).

&gt;<i> The error in littlest is probably related to the timing-problem.  It's an

I filed a bug for this issue (#23998).

Thanks for your feedback!
