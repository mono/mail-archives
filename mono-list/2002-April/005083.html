<PRE>Hi!!

&gt;<i> There was a problem with included files if you are using
</I>&gt;<i> version 1.3 of mingw and w32api.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now it is solved and changes are on CVS.
</I>
That might have been it. I just re-ran the build-win32 script (after
cleaning up) and everything worked flawlessly... except pkgconfig which
still didn't change /target to the actual path in the .pc files.
Maybe it's because I had previously installed Cygwin's pkgconfig... :-)

Anyway it worked with my old pkgconfig-files and I have finally compiled
Mono on Cygwin... yeeeeeeeeeess. :o)

Thanx everybody... and go Mono!

Dennis
