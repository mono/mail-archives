<PRE>Daniel,

I _was_ using kalyptus to generate the bindings.  Kalyptus is a perl tool 
adapted from KDoc (kde's documentation generator) and written by Richard 
Dale.  Unfortunately, it was difficult for me to use kalyptus/perl with some 
of the features of the Qt bindings, so I took a page from Mike ;-) and wrote 
a tool in C#.  Basically, I'm using kalyptus to generate an Xml file which is 
then parsed using the aforementioned tool and converted into the bindings.  
The qt generator is written with mcs/mono/mint and our libraries from the 
ground up!  That's right, Mono is sufficiently advanced for me to do the 
development completely with Free tools ;-)  Pretty cool huh!

At first I was going to try and reuse some of Mike's generator, but the 
bindings are sufficiently different that I just bit the bullet and rolled my 
own.  I'm not sure if either my tool or Mike's is suitable for your purpose, 
but if you think so then your welcome to it.  Currently, the qt generator 
resides on my harddrive and Mike's is in Mono's cvs.
