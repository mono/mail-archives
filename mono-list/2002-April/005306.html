<PRE>I've been thinking wether it would be possible to make gtk#2windows.forms
converter or namespace.
I personally have doubts about this as gtk# has some things win32 has not
and because it has this different positioning system.

But it would make mono apps extremly portable.

By the way: If I use windows.forms on gnome, too, because I want to stay
portable to windows, will the thing be much slower than using gtk# directly,
because of  the step more?
