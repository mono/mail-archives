OK, please read that again, i admit straight up, this may be considered 
off topic by some, but im having a very difficult time with it.


With c#, it is my understanding that you can use other langauges in your 
c# code so to speak, im sure its a bit more technical than that, but i 
have three questions.

1. Do you plan to implement this feature in your implementation of .net?
2. (and this is teh OT question) does anyone know actually how it 
works/how you even do it? Ive looked around at the microsoft .net site, 
but to no avail, it was also mentioned on perl but i was a little 
confused, i dont actually understand, if all ti does is make it so you 
can use other langauges code through DLLS, cant any language just 
compile a DLL and you can then use that in your other langauge app? im 
confused.
3. will your implementation be diffirent?



Thanks.
Peter
