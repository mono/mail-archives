<PRE>Dear experts and speakers:

An exceptional international developer conference covering the
new .NET platform is coming up - and your expertise is wanted!

SIGS-DATACOM/101communications is planning to host the first
multi-platform .NET developer event ever:

.NET ONE

on: November, 5 &amp; 6 2002
in: Cologne, Germany


The conference goal is very ambitious:

-Gather as many parties working on .NET implementation efforts
 on any platform and have them share their knowledge.
 SIGS-DATACOM/101 would like to explicitly invite experts from the
 Open Source movement (e.g. dotGNU) and other projects (e.g. Mono)
 to discuss their work and views with an international
 developer audience.
-Provide insights into the inner workings of different
 .NET implementations.
-Provide the most hardcore technical information on using .NET
 technologies on different platforms.
-Explain the how &amp; why of tools like compilers, editors,
 IL-obfuscators etc.

.NET ONE is about drawing together .NET experts to educate
advanced .NET developers on the finer points of the .NET Framework
and its implementations on Windows as well as non-Windows platforms.

No introductory/beginners sessions will be accepted on the agenda!
The audience is expected to have considerable experience in working
with a .NET Framework implementation.


As the technical content manager (technical chair) for the conference,
I´d like to invite you to become part of .NET ONE as a speaker.

I´m looking for deep technical presentations in any of the following
areas:

-using the .NET Framework
  +CLR
  +base class library
  +remoting
  +reflection
  +multithreading
  +xml web services
  +ado.net
-implementing the .NET Framework
  +garbage collection
  +type system
  +JIT compilation
  +execution engine
  +class library
-developing tools for the .NET Framework
  +compiler construction for .NET
  +programming language editors
  +class browsers
  +documentation tools
  +VS .NET add-ins
  +windows forms custom controls

Technical breakout sessions will be 75min each. Presentations can be
in English (preferred) or German.

If you´d like to contribute one or more presentations on the above
topics (or others fitting the general idea of the conference), please
submit the following information for each:

-presentation title
-a 2-3 line abstract
-a bullet point list of technologies/aspects covered

Also please include a short bio of yours (max. 400 chars) with your
session proposals. If you like, please indicate if you´d be interested
in exhibiting at .NET ONE.

Submissions should be in presentation language.

Please submit your proposals to me until: May, 13 2002


I hope you´re as excited about this event, as I am. .NET ONE will
finally be a forum, where discussions about .NET will enter a new
level of depth and proficiency.
.NET ONE has neither intention nor need of convincing anybody to
use a .NET implementation. The audience will already be doing so.
Instead .NET ONE is dedicated to show how to fully .NET technologies/
concepts on any platform.

I´m looking forward to receiving your session proposals. If you´ve
any questions, though, please feel free to contact me any time.

Best regards,

Ralf Westphal
.NET ONE Technical Content Manager

PS: Please pass on this call for speakers to your colleagues or any
party you know might be interested in speaking or exhibiting at
.NET ONE. Thank you for your help.
