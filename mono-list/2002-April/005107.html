Just downloaded the test suite and run it. I'm attaching the test
result, along with the results of the same tests on a Linux box with
RedHat 7.2. Both with mono-0.10.

No hints about the missing EOF problem.

What's your opinion about the test suite results?

BTW: even on linux, if I try to compile with mcs a source file stored on
an NFS volume, I get a core dump. Is this a known issue?

Cheers,
