I would suggest that it is unfortunate for *you* that you believe that
everyone should have an *ideological* motivation for developing software
that is free of monetary cost at the point of use and whose source code is
open to the consumer.  Software development is a pragmatic activity, the
idealogues whose every word you seem to have swallowed whole spend more
time writing manifestos than code, the people here want to deliver a
working implementation of what probably will become a de facto software
standard before your much vaunted 'Free Software Movement' is left
standing in the dust.

I think in the context of this project contribution in terms of test
results, patches, documentation and so forth is more valuable than
metadiscussion about the aims and ideology of some nebulous 'Free Software
Movement' - the licensing arrangements of the project are already settled
and, sure it is not a GPL, there is no reason to dispute this IMO.

I'm sure if you asked nicely someone will create a new mailling list for
you to discuss the ideological issues with projects of this sort, but I am
also sure that this is not really the place.
