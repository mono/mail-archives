<PRE>Hi everybody!

I'm a computer science student from Germany and I'm interested in
contributing to mono. I've been watching the list and trying to learn as
much as I can and I tried compiling Mono-0.10 on Cygwin last weekend.

The win-32 build script didn't really work for me, everything was put in
~mono/install and the /target prefixes kinda messed things up. Anyway, I
just installed everything manually and all the things seem to be in place.
However, I still habe problems with the include-paths.
By default, I get this compiler message:

gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I../.. -I/usr/include/glib-2.0 -I/usr/lib/glib-
2.0/
include   -I/usr/include/glib-2.0 -I/usr/lib/glib-2.0/include   -I../.. -I..
/../
mono -DMONO_ASSEMBLIES=\&quot;&quot;/usr/local/lib&quot;\&quot;                 -g -Wall -Wunuse
d -W

I was wondering, because /usr/include isn't included, while netdb.h is
required:

missing-prototypes -Wmissing-declarations -mno-cygwin -c socket-io.c
socket-io.c:25: netdb.h: No such file or directory

I hacked the build scripts to include /usr/include, which showed that
netdb.h conflicts with the windows sockets.

Can anybody tell me which include-paths I really need (is Glib + Windows
enough)? Is there anything special to watch out for when compiling on
windows?

Thanx for ur help!

Dennis
