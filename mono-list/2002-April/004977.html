GLib has been a tough dependency to have for systems different from
Linux, simply because it was in development and had build issues.
I hope that now that GLib 2.0 is out, there will be fewer issues,
especially if people working on the 'weird' platforms submit patches to
the GLib maintainers for build problems or other portability issues.

I didn't copy the hash code lightly: it was the only way to get
functionality GLib doesn't provide while keeping some API compatibility
and I would consider a mistake getting rid of the GLib dependency.
I may also try to get a patch in GLib that allows us to get rid of
the copy.
After all, you're going to have quite a bit more problems porting mono
than porting GLib and porting GLib makes more people happier.
If there are issues porting GLib, you'd have the same issues porting
our replacement for the GLib functionality, you'd just duplicate code
and efforts.
If the GLib mainatiners won't accept patches in a timely manner, that
could be a different problem, but I don't think that is the issue.
Serge: what problems did you have? How can we help you?
