Would it be possible to create a (or use an existing) Linux kernel in =
C++ but only the minimum required to implement the Mono version of the =
CLR (and whatever else is needed to run .NET applications) and to set =
some properties to load a chosen program when it starts (the explorer =
program)? This way you could build an OS almost completely in C# which =
is much easier to program than C++. You would be able to download OS =
components from the web, download interfaces, etc. similar to the =
current versions of Linux and you could completely customise the OS. =
With this, if you wanted a PC to do set specific tasks you wouldn't have =
to install an OS, only the kernel, then you just build on that, and you =
can't do this with Windows because you have to install everything first.

Anyway, just thinking out loud. If anyone wants to try this I'd love to =
build some of the C# components for it, and anything else I can do to =
help. Also, please tell me about it because I would love to have an OS =
as functional as Windows but without the crap.

Cheers,
John
