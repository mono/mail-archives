<PRE>Yeah that's a really exciting prospect, isn't it? We're already seeing
some manifestations of this kind of setup in JavaOS, and in Lucent's
Inferno/Limbo. But C# would be nicer :)

I would imagine (me speaking as someone with zero kernel development
experience) that writing your own Linux kernel might take a while ;)
How about building a minimal kernel from the excellent existing codebase,
and then concentrating your efforts on building your higher-level
services using C#.

If you really want a custom OS, grab a ready made microkernel (eg
Fiasco is a C++ rewrite of L4) and chuck in a few goodies from Utah's
OSKit. But that sounds like hard work to me...

Another poster recently posed this same idea using DOS as the base. We
should think about these things. In my opinion one of the best
features of Mono is its complete lack of dependencies - something
that makes it extremely attractive to the embedded people. I'm
absolutely positive that in a year's time embedded developers are
going to be looking very hard at this project.

We need to continue to be clear about the contract between Mono and
the host system. For instance, many embedded platforms don't provide
any virtual memory services - is this going to be a problem? Some of
them provide better threading services - can we exploit them? If we
get input from people trying to do these crazy things then we can
direct our development so that Mono is available to the biggest possible
userbase.

Dan.
