More specifically, M$ is banning &quot;IPR Impairing License&quot;s. From the new license:

QUOTE
1.4 &quot;IPR Impairing License&quot; shall mean the GNU General Public License, the
GNU Lesser/Library General Public License, and any license that requires
in any instance that other software distributed with software subject to
such license (a) be disclosed and distributed in source code form; (b) be
licensed for purposes of making derivative works; or (c) be
redistributable at no charge.
/QUOTE

Ignoring the blatant, upfront attack on GNU licenses, M$'s attempt to define 
copyleft is way off course; not even the GPL places any restrictions on 
&quot;software distributed with software subject to such license&quot;.

Hmm, this could be read a couple of different ways... ;)
