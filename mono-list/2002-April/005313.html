<PRE>The difference is, I think, that gtk+ postioins objects with (invisible)
boxes, relatively to the screen.
For example a button is in windows.forms at position 300, 100
I gtk+ it has not a clearly defined postion, but rather a relative postition
in a box.

So how should windows.forms be done? I don't know the mono-plans, but maybe
this is done by using several boxes.

The explanation is not perfect, and I'm not sure if it is right.
