<PRE>&gt;<i> Could someone explain why this is &quot;pretty straight forward&quot; code??  I'm
</I>&gt;<i> probably missing something as I think this is one of the hardest things to
</I>&gt;<i> accomplish yet with mono (assuming that objects serialized with mono 
</I>&gt;<i> must be able to deserialize using the MS .Net runtime and vice versa).
</I>
Duncan wrote a tool (mcs/tools/serialize.cs) that helps you with this. 
Basically it tells you what fields must be serialized and the key names
that you have to use.

Duncan said last night `I will write a serialization howto', as he did
most of the existing serialization support in Mono.

Something that I believe we have not done is make sure that classes that
are tagged as `Serializable' have the same field names as their .NET
counterparts.  Since these will be automatically serialized, and
Reflection will be used to serialize them, we need to make our fields
have the same names as the .NET ones do.
