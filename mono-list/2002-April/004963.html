<PRE>You can't write an OS in C#

First, C# just isn't fast enough.  To write an OS you need a level of
power that only C and assembly can provide.  You need low-level access
and you need efficiency.  The Linux kernel is written in C, not C++ (a few
compoents are probably even in assembly).


Second, Linux is already immesnsely configurable.  It is already divided
into a kernel and a set of modules.  Most of the code in Linux is
actually on the modules.  You can choose to only run the modules you
need.  This customisability is part of the reason why Linux is so
succesful in the embedded market.

Third, I have trouble seeing how this idea would be possible.  C# code is
compiled to the IL.  Then a JIT turns this into native code just before
running it.  By the time you have all this infrastructure you will just
about have an entire OS.  There won't be much left to write on C#.


Cheers,
Daniel.
