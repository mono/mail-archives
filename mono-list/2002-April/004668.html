Anyone can subscribe to the list and voice his opinion.
When he starts harassing, we tell him so. We don't need whining people
on the list, we need contributors willing to write free software for
mono. If you want we can open an advocacy mailing-list where you can
write all your opinions, you're currently just wasting our time.

To keep the mail on topic: we as mono don't have documentation, yet.
We welcome people to contribute in this area, in the meantime, both
the ECMA specs and msdn site offer the documentation that one may need
on C#, the runtime or the class libraries.

As for using the MS runtime: I suggest all kind of people, even newbies,
to try out mono and report any bug they may find. We need bug reports,
the more people the better. If we'll get too many useless bug reports
from people that blame mono/mcs because they didn't read the C# spec,
we'll deal with it someway. Sometimes it's useful if someone that
reports a bug tests for it also with the ms runtime, this helps track
down better where the issue is.

Someone may suggest to use the MS runtime to newbies: I think they 
don't understand how free software works. However it is their personal
opinion and you should deal with it as such with them personally
instead of wasting the time of all the people on this list.

&gt;<i> Also BTW, your mail also came on the list -- please mail me privately
</I>&gt;<i> from now on about your issues with my opinions.

Your microsoft-sponsored @yahoo mail address bounced.
