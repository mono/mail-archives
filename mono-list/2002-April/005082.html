<PRE>Steve, Greg, and List,

After some additional research into the issues involved, I believe that
Steve¹s summary is quite accurate.  My personal conclusion is that we should
give Windows.Forms our best shot using straight Cocoa/Quartz first, and use
Carbon as a fall-back option.  Clearly we have hashed out many of the
advantages and disadvantages of both, and we can make a well-informed
decision when the time comes.

I also recently read that much of the Carbon complaints that I currently
have are being addressed in OS X 10.2 (improved font anti-aliasing, more
OSX-like behavior, elimination of a few OS 9ish oddities).  This is of
course good news for all.

For my part, I know a good bit about Cocoa already, but have just placed
orders on a few Cocoa books and a few Carbon books that I have not yet read.
I will continue to research and when Mono is ready for Windows.Forms, I will
hopefully be ready to help too.  Although, I will need to do some research
about Windows.Forms to really know what I am getting into.  Any ideas where
I could start?

</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> There you will see that Carbon is really intended for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> porting legacy Mac OS code, and is based on older API's.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cocoa is for new code.  Cocoa is a higher level framework,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which heavily makes use of Quartz for doing all low-level
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> graphics operations.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I digress... we need to use Quartz and Cocoa to implement
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Windows.Forms, and avoid Carbon at all costs, since its for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> legacy code anyway =)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's true that Carbon was created for the benefit of legacy code, but I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> sure it should be dismissed it out of hand.  Carbon exists, it works, and it's
</I>&gt;<i> likely to be supported for a very long time (since many of the major OS X
</I>&gt;<i> applications are based on it).  So, if it's easier to write Windows.Forms on
</I>&gt;<i> top of Carbon than Cocoa, then Carbon may be the better choice.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here are the issues as I see them:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Cocoa is the older, more mature framework, and one gets the sense that
</I>&gt;<i> Apple &quot;likes it better&quot;.  All other things being equal, Cocoa is probably the
</I>&gt;<i> framework of choice.  However, I think it's easy to overstate this.  Carbon is
</I>&gt;<i> well supported, and (as noted above) is likely to remain so.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. There is a general impression that Cocoa applications act &quot;more native&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> than Carbon applications, with better adherence to the Mac OS X UI guidelines,
</I>&gt;<i> better performance, etc.  However, I've never heard a solid reason given for
</I>&gt;<i> this.  I suspect that it's partly a false perception, caused by the fact that
</I>&gt;<i> most Cocoa applications were written with Mac OS X in mind, while most Carbon
</I>&gt;<i> applications are ports.  However, there may be some truth here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Carbon can be used in C++; Cocoa requires C (or Objective C).  This is not
</I>&gt;<i> a huge issue (it can be eliminated with glue code, and some people prefer C
</I>&gt;<i> anyway), but it's an issue.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4. There is an impression that Cocoa is &quot;higher level&quot; than Carbon, which
</I>&gt;<i> could be good (a more powerful toolkit) or bad (dictates too much behavior to
</I>&gt;<i> allow implementing Windows Forms correctly).  I don't know enough about Cocoa
</I>&gt;<i> to evaluate this, but it should be taken seriously.  I have experience with
</I>&gt;<i> emulating one application framework on top of another, and it can be extremely
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to do this well if the target framework is &quot;too high level&quot;. It
</I>&gt;<i> would be a real shame to go down the road of implementing Windows.Forms on
</I>&gt;<i> Cocoa and later discover that it can't be done well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would be very useful to &quot;test the waters&quot;, by writing a simple Cocoa
</I>&gt;<i> application (in C, Objective C, or Java) that implements a subset of
</I>&gt;<i> Windows.Forms as an internal API.  Also, someone should talk to the Eclipse
</I>&gt;<i> team to find out specifically what problems they had porting SWT to Cocoa.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't claim to derive a conclusion from this, I'm just trying to lay out the
</I>&gt;<i> issues. Is this list complete?  Is it correct?  If so, then we can discuss the
</I>&gt;<i> relative weight of each issue.  If not, please help me complete it.
</I>&gt;<i>
