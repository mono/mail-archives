Well, since the whole document is a license agreement for the technical
reference documentation, I don't see how it in any way can be legally
binding if said technical reference was not used. That would be implying
that Microsoft can arbitrarily force people to accept legally binding
documents of their products by simply by posting it on their website,
even if these people do not use the products the license was referring
to!

I agree fully, and IANAL, so your milage with any of this may vary :)
