You probably won't get it to fail...

I've just deleted my mono directory and re-checked out everything and
compiled it all, and now it's working.

I have just updated glib2 as well to version 2.0.1-1 (I can't remember
what it was before - something like 1.4.3). Before I was checking stuff
out without deleting it as well, which I thought would update my copy
properly, but obviously not. Or perhaps the make clean doesn't quite
clean everything?

Anyway, it's all working now. Even making mcs2 and mcs3 works. I'm
getting somewhere at last!
