<PRE>I am building mono from source using a non-standard prefix.  I then am
manually bundling the pieces of mono that I need (not using mkbundle) like
the mono executable, mscorlib, and the class libraries.  When I deploy my
application with the bundled mono to a test linux box it works if I am
targeting mono framework version 2.0.

I upgraded my project properties to target mono framework 4.0.  During the
bundle process I copied over the 4.0 class libraries and mscorlib.  After
deploying my application with the bundled mono to the test linux box and
executing it, I get the error &quot;The assembly mscorlib.dll was not found or
could not be loaded.&quot;  Above that error it says: &quot;Assembly Loader probing
location&quot; and gives a path to where mscorlib.dll would be found on the
machine I performed the build on.

What is the correct way to instruct mono where to find mscorlib.dll and the
GAC that I have manually bundled?  I read that setting MONO_PATH is not
recommended and if I were to set that environment variable I would have to
explicitly provide the path to every GAC assembly I am referencing for it to
work.
