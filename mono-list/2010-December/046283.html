You will have to wait for a more authoritative answer, but as a user of Mono
on RHEL5 I can say that I see no reason why you would not be able to build
and run Mono on RHEL4.  I would not be surprised if there are no packages
kicking around for that though.  You will probably have to build from
source.  This could be a bit of a pain.

I would expect the biggest problem to be compiling libgdiplus as it relies
on quite a few graphics libraries (including Cairo).  Mono almost certainly
needs newer versions than you have in RHEL4.  So, you will have to update
these which will likely also require building from source.  It may also
require newer versions of automake, autoconf, or the like.

libgdiplus is an implementation of GDI+ for Linux which is used to support
System.Drawing.

After you get libgdiplus in place, Mono should build fine I expect.  If you
are building Mono 2.8+ you will not have to worry about what version of
glib2 you have installed as Mono now uses the built-in eglib instead.  I
think maybe the only other thing you might need is bison.

If you want to run asp.net stuff you may run into an issue with the age of
your Apache install as well but I am not sure about that either.

Note, I have not tried to build Mono on RHEL4 myself.  Mono works very well
with RHEL5 if you are looking for an excuse to upgrade.

Mono does not impact the kernel at all.  It runs 100% in user space.  What
your production guys will or will not freak out about is hard to know of
course.

If you specify &quot;--prefix=/usr&quot; when you build Mono almost everything will
end up in &quot;/usr/lib/mono&quot;.  I think the default is &quot;/usr/local/lib/mono&quot; if
you do not specify anything.
