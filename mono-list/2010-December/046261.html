.NET exe files are in an intermediate byte code format (CIL), meaning they're
not Windows binaries (unlike native exe files, although they use the same
extension). .NET and Mono JIT-compile the CIL code to native code on the
fly, when running the application. That's why it's portable. Java works the
same way.

And yeah, to build your solution on Ubuntu, that should basically be it.
It's also possible to avoid command lines and use a GUI program to do it
(Synaptic or another one).

By the way, unless your application is simple, you might want to double
check that it works properly on Linux (there's a LiveCD and stuff on the
Mono download page). You might have done or used something that isn't
portable, and you may encounter Mono bugs too. And there are fair chances
that your teacher has an old version of Mono, depending on his Ubuntu
version, which means he could encounter old Mono bugs that have been fixed
since then, or missing features that you're relying on and that have been
added since then.
If he tells you his Ubuntu version, you'll be able to figure out which Mono
version he has.
