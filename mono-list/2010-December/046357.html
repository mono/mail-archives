&gt;<i> Hi everyone,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   In following the advice provided here, I downloaded and installed
</I>&gt;<i> SharpDevelop. I made a simple salary calculator in C#, just to test it
</I>&gt;<i> out.  I have to say, I like what I've seen so far. The IDE is lightning
</I>&gt;<i> fast, as well as compilation. Code Completion also works like a charm.
</I>&gt;<i> The only catch... I don't think it's compiling using my installed Mono
</I>&gt;<i> compilers, since, when debugging the app, I cannot see mono.exe in my
</I>&gt;<i> Task Manager, so I guess it must be using .net framework instead of
</I>&gt;<i> Mono. Does anyone know how to change this, or how to determine which
</I>&gt;<i> framework it is using to run? The reason I want this is because I want
</I>&gt;<i> to take advantage of Mono's SQLite support on future projects, which is
</I>&gt;<i> not available on VS Express.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   I also tried MonoDevelop 2.4 on my 4GB of RAM Vaio laptop, with
</I>&gt;<i> Windows 7. When the IDE started, the system slowed down incredibly (I
</I>&gt;<i> couldn't even Alt-Tab to switch windows). After a few minutes, I was
</I>&gt;<i> able to open task manager, and saw a MonoDevelop.exe process, along with
</I>&gt;<i> three mono.exe processes, one of which was using 1.5 GB of the available
</I>&gt;<i> system memory. The other mono.exe processes were using 262 MB and 20 MB
</I>&gt;<i> of RAM (approximately, as the numbers kept changing). After a few more
</I>&gt;<i> minutes, the MonoDevelop interface appeared, and the mono process using
</I>&gt;<i> 1.5 GB of memory went down to about 15 MB of RAM.  But I still could not
</I>&gt;<i> interact with the interface. I finally decided to end all four
</I>&gt;<i> processes, but even after doing so, the system was still slow, so I was
</I>&gt;<i> forced to restart.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   This is exactly the same that happened when I tried MonoDevelop on a 1
</I>&gt;<i> GB of RAM machine a few months back. I was, however, able to run
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop sucessfully of a 2 GB RAM desktop PC. Since my 4 GB laptop
</I>&gt;<i> also presented the same problems, I'm guessing the problem is not lack
</I>&gt;<i> of RAM. Could something in MonoDevelop cause it to be incompatible with
</I>&gt;<i> laptops (sounds unlikely)? Or could there be some additional
</I>&gt;<i> configuration that must be done after installing the Mono framework that
</I>&gt;<i> I have failed to do?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I was advised, I'll ask this same question at the MonoDevelop list
</I>&gt;<i> tomorrow, but if anyone has any additional suggestions that I might try,
</I>&gt;<i> they're more than welcome. (I don't mind using SharpDevelop, as long as
</I>&gt;<i> I can get it to compile my projects with the Mono compilers).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On a final note, all of these machines I've tested MonoDevelop on can
</I>&gt;<i> run VS Express, even if it's a bit sluggish and slow to start.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for any advice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sincerely,
</I>&gt;<i> Omar Campos Rivera
