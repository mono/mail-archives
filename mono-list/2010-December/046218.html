<PRE>
If you're strong with FreeBSD (as far as getting packages working correctly
and updating dependencies) it might be a walk in the park for you to get it
all configured. As I mentioned, I was able to get it all working on PC-BSD.
My endeavor was to test out the cross-platform capability of Mono as well. I
was able to stage a working Mono and MonoDevelop on Windows/Mac/Mint (based
on Ubuntu)/openSuse/Fedora/PC-BSD (based on FreeBSD). I took an ASP.Net app
and a WinForm app that I had written and managed to have them run on all
those instances....so it is possible. 

Out of all the platforms, Windows/Mac/openSuse were the easiest to get
Mono/MonoDevelop up and running. Mint required me to build from source
because at the time I was doing it, the repositories available were a
revision behind in Mono. Fedora just required finding the correct
repositories to get the latest Mono.
