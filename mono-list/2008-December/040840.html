no clue - but keep in mind that &#65279;MonoTODO means this is _incomplete_
compared to MS implementation, but not that it's non-working. Only
actual testing, on Mono, will show if it's complete enough for you.

&gt;<i> &gt; void .ctor (string)/void .ctor (string, int)/void .ctor (Uri)/void .ctor

In this case it looks like the author knew, likely from MSDN
documentation, that the code _should_ requires &#65279;some
EnvironmentPermission. 

Now Mono does not support Code Access Security (CAS) so
having &#65279;EnvironmentPermission would not change anything (if this is the
only incomplete thing). This should not be an issue unless your
application needs to run under limited trust, since all Mono code runs,
right now, at full trust.

&gt;<i> But what about the another 5 errors? This is something that could be fixed
</I>&gt;<i> only my Mono-Dev team? I am very interested in helping to fix them.

A bit hard to answer since you did not provide them.
