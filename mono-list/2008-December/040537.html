<PRE>Hello,

(I'm picking up unanswered email.)

- If you are using remoting, then
   - if those Mono versions match, it should work.
   - If one hand is .NET, then it may not (basically you shouldn't expect
     it may work), since remoting depends on private implementation and
     they are different. Some classes are binary serialization
     compatible, but in general they aren't.
- If you are using xml serialization, then it should work.

Platform should not matter.

&gt;<i> 2. How stable and complete is the ARM port of mono?
</I>
I have no answer. Probably no one would. Mono JIT is ported to ARM,
with some limitations. If you give detailed questions, others may answer
to you.

&gt;<i> 3. Are there any issues we should be aware of for this usage scenario?
</I>
Probably my answer to 1. holds here?
