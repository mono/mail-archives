<PRE>Hey all,

I've posted here before during my efforts of porting our .NET software over
to linux.  It's a rather big project, but I have a couple of questions.

1.)  Our licensing system does not offer a 64bit library for linux.  The
company says that it should be &quot;backwards compatible&quot;, but every time we try
to P/Invoke into that library on 64bit, it comes back that the library is
either missing or corrupted.  It's not missing, and I've double checked the
config file dllmaps, I've pasted the thing everywhere.  It sees it, so I
think it's saying it's corrupted.  Is this expected?  Is there any way to
get this 32bit library that we currently us (and works) to work on our 64bit
machine?

2.)  We've been thinking about moving our codebase over to linux, but the
thought of trying to re-set up such a big pile of spaghetti and compile it
all on linux scares me.  What are the benefits of actually compiling our
.NET code on linux, vs compiling it in visual studio and copying it over?
I've seen so many screenshots of good looking Mono apps, and our app just
seems to fall short in reponsiveness and crisp looks.  Will it look better
compiling it natively?  Will our underlying algorithms run faster from
optimization or something?

Thanks in advance,

Eric Morgan
