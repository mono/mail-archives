<PRE>Miguel,

Thank you for your reply. This is the kind of answer I was hoping for.
I think you were right to like &quot;Mono&quot; in the names, as I do now. But I've
already made my point on that, no need to dig further.
Thanks about your clarifications on MonoMac and the MonoSpace conference.
There really were some pieces I had missed.
About Roslyn, I just want to make sure I've made myself clear: I have no
problem with it being delayed, I don't have intention of using it because
cannot see what it can give me that C# REPL cannot. What I wanted to stress
on is that they were extremely far from what you had and the only reason
they showed it was just to show that &quot;we were first&quot;, even though their
&quot;first&quot; was not usable then and is barely usable now.
&quot;It matters what they are now.&quot; - no point in arguing here. I just want to
give a quick example with one of your points: they contributed those Hyper-V
drivers for the Linux kernel only because someone discovered they were
linking to GPL code; not to mention these drivers are something the kernel
itself has no use of. Anyway - I won't ever agree that Microsoft has
changed. In some distant future may be, because no one knows what may happen
then but not now or in the next at least 5 years. I do hope that given how
you feel about them they won't succeed in playing dirty tricks on you and
Mono.

I hope you and the whole team understand this was all well-intentioned and I
hope you can find some constructive criticism. I wish you all the best and
even more success.

Best regards,
Dimitar Dobrev
