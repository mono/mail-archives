<PRE>Thanks for the response. That is pretty much what I figured, but I just wanted to make sure there wasn't something I was missing. I can definitely just use a normal Windows service for what I need to do, but WCF via Rabbit seemed like a smarter way to do it.

Thanks for the reference on ServiceStack too. Looks cool, though not positive it will do everything I need for this project.

WCF services on mono do not work so well.  Even if you can get them to function, I've found the implementation does not perform very well.  If you get away from HTTP bindings, things get worse, and I'm not sure at all about the RabbitMQ bindings.

I use RabbitMQ heavily under mono and the regular driver works very well.  Can you get away from WCF for this?

Also, if you're building services in mono, or want a nice framework that is fully supported on both mono and .NET, I highly recommend using ServiceStack (<A HREF="http://ServiceStack.net">http://ServiceStack.net</A>). It performs quite well on both mono and .NET, and most people find the design approach to be quite refreshing.  I certainly do.

I am evaluating some uses of Mono for a project that we are currently working
on in my organization, and I have run into a stumbling block that I am
hoping may just be user error on my part.

I created a Console service host for a small (2 method) WCF service. When I
attempt to start this service, I get the following error on both Mono 2.10.9
and 3.0.3:

System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElementCollection doesn't implement
interface
System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable&lt;System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement&gt;
Stacktrace:

  at &lt;unknown&gt; &lt;0xffffffff&gt;
  at System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElementCollection..ctor
(System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1&lt;System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement&gt;)
[0x00006] in
/home/mconway/mono-3.0.3/mcs/class/System.ServiceModel/System.ServiceModel.Channels/BindingElementCollection.cs:48

I can pastebin my code if that would help, but it is a simple
host.AddServiceEndpoint Implementation using the RabbitMQBinding. Is there
another way I should be going about starting this service, or is this just
an example of unsupported WCF behavior?

I ran the MoMA against this exe and dll, and they both passed with no
errors/warnings.

Thanks in advance.
Mike
