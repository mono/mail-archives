<PRE>I really do hope that x studio is just really the new name of the 3.1 monodevelop. I hear all of what you say in that the mono community seems quite separate from much that you see on the go-mono.com pages, I wonder if we should start a 'mono planet' sort of thing to join things up and to keep alive these sorts of questions.

&gt;<i>Hello, all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I guess most of you see the announcement of Xamarin 2.0 as good news.
</I>&gt;<i>However, I cannot help but feel the opposite. Let me tell you why:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>1. At the  Xamarin 2.0 FAQ &lt;<A HREF="http://xamarin.com/xamarin-2.0-faq">http://xamarin.com/xamarin-2.0-faq</A>&gt;   it
</I>&gt;<i>says:
</I>&gt;<i>   Our new product brands are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Xamarin.iOS (replaces MonoTouch)
</I>&gt;<i>    Xamarin.Android (replaces Mono for Android)
</I>&gt;<i>    Xamarin Studio, our new IDE (replaces MonoDevelop)
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i>   That is, the name &quot;Mono&quot; is now completely phased out of the Xamarin
</I>&gt;<i>product line. At  the Xamarin Studio page &lt;<A HREF="http://xamarin.com/studio">http://xamarin.com/studio</A>&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i>,
</I>&gt;<i>MonoDevelop, upon which the Studio is based, is not mentioned once! Are
</I>&gt;<i>you
</I>&gt;<i>ashamed of MonoDevelop after you've been offering it to customers for
</I>&gt;<i>years?
</I>&gt;<i>At the  Xamarin main page &lt;<A HREF="http://xamarin.com/">http://xamarin.com/</A>&gt;   Mono is mentioned
</I>&gt;<i>only
</I>&gt;<i>once at the very bottom, under the &quot;Community&quot; section - is Mono no
</I>&gt;<i>longer
</I>&gt;<i>part of Xamarin itself?
</I>&gt;<i> I think this is not the beginning but rather the end of a process that
</I>&gt;<i>started with the renaming of MonoMac to Xamarin.Mac (and please don't
</I>&gt;<i>tell
</I>&gt;<i>me &quot;MonoMac is our community-supported version&quot; because I haven't heard
</I>&gt;<i>about it since). Then was the renaming of YOUR MonoSpace conference to
</I>&gt;<i>MonkeySpace and the explanation was really ridiculous - &quot;bigger
</I>&gt;<i>scope...
</I>&gt;<i>open source .NET development in general&quot; (Miguel de Icaza at that very
</I>&gt;<i>same
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;Monkey&quot;Space conference). What bigger scope? .NET runs only on
</I>&gt;<i>Windows, be
</I>&gt;<i>it desktop or phone, while Mono runs on tens of platforms, including
</I>&gt;<i>Windows. Yes, I do understand it's about &quot;the scope of the community&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>but
</I>&gt;<i>how broader is that community since the only significant piece of .NET
</I>&gt;<i>missing in Mono is WPF?
</I>&gt;<i>Mono is the core of your company, both historically and at present,
</I>&gt;<i>since
</I>&gt;<i>all of your products are based on it. And you are removing its name
</I>&gt;<i>from
</I>&gt;<i>anywhere it's mentioned. I don't see this as justified even for
</I>&gt;<i>marketing
</I>&gt;<i>reasons because if people know about you, it's because of Mono. That
</I>&gt;<i>is,
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;Mono&quot; is your marketing message. If you do reply to this mail, I'd
</I>&gt;<i>really
</I>&gt;<i>like to hear something a little deeper that &quot;The change of our product
</I>&gt;<i>names
</I>&gt;<i>does not mean we are abandoning Mono, we are going to support it just
</I>&gt;<i>as
</I>&gt;<i>before&quot;. We all know how this works out: the name is abandoned, time
</I>&gt;<i>passes,
</I>&gt;<i>many current users forget about it, new users do not learn it at all,
</I>&gt;<i>and
</I>&gt;<i>after a little more time the project itself is abandoned. This kind of
</I>&gt;<i>tactics reminds me of a very specific company which leads me to:
</I>&gt;<i>2.  &quot;Microsoft Joins Xamarin Evolve 2013 as Sole Platinum Sponsor&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>&lt;<A HREF="http://blog.xamarin.com/microsoft-joins-xamarin-evolve-2013-as-sole-platinum-sponsor/">http://blog.xamarin.com/microsoft-joins-xamarin-evolve-2013-as-sole-platinum-sponsor/</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>- I believe Microsoft have proven time and time again that they are
</I>&gt;<i>enemies
</I>&gt;<i>of Mono in particular and of open source in general. I do not want to
</I>&gt;<i>quote
</I>&gt;<i>a large part of the web on that but let me say a few words just about
</I>&gt;<i>Mono.
</I>&gt;<i>   Miguel, you may remember you said &quot;Microsoft as a company are not
</I>&gt;<i>open-source-friendly&quot; yourself at FOSDEM at the beginning of 2011. You
</I>&gt;<i>may
</I>&gt;<i>also remember how you at the same conference you told the story how you
</I>&gt;<i>showed your C# REPL to Microsoft just before PDC 2008 and once they saw
</I>&gt;<i>that, they changed their program and rushed their C# REPL with the only
</I>&gt;<i>intent of showing it before you did. The proof that they didn't have a
</I>&gt;<i>working product back then (while you did) lies in the simple fact that
</I>&gt;<i>now,
</I>&gt;<i>5 (five!) years later Microsoft still do not have a working version
</I>&gt;<i>(Roslyn
</I>&gt;<i>is still a CTP and nobody knows when it's going to be released). While
</I>&gt;<i>at
</I>&gt;<i>the same time your C# REPL has been constantly evolving up to the point
</I>&gt;<i>that
</I>&gt;<i>NRefactory is based upon it. You may also remember that just a few
</I>&gt;<i>months
</I>&gt;<i>later that same 2011 the whole Mono team was ousted when Novell was
</I>&gt;<i>bought
</I>&gt;<i>my Attachmate - and its patents sold to a consortium of technology
</I>&gt;<i>companies
</I>&gt;<i>led by Microsoft (CPTN Holdings). For last I'd like to return to
</I>&gt;<i>MonoSpace
</I>&gt;<i>and the fact that a little before the renaming in the organization were
</I>&gt;<i>involved a number of Microsoft employees, such as Scott Hanselman, and
</I>&gt;<i>I
</I>&gt;<i>don't believe they have nothing to do with the erasure of &quot;Mono&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I've been a Mono user for years and I'd really like for it to continue
</I>&gt;<i>to
</I>&gt;<i>flourish. It's just that I don't see this happening if everything goes
</I>&gt;<i>on
</I>&gt;<i>like that. I hope there will be positive change, it's not nearly late
</I>&gt;<i>for
</I>&gt;<i>it.
</I>&gt;<i>
