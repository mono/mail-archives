I'll let you know if any lawyers contact me. For now I'll bank that
they are unlikely to want me to unpublish results which say that the
MS .NET Runtime is between 50% and 1500% faster than another runtime.

There are many more C# benchmarks here:

 <A HREF="http://dada.perl.it/shootout/">http://dada.perl.it/shootout/</A>

I can see how the anti-benchmarking clause was important to the MS
lawyers, because if an article was published showing a brand new .NET
runtime slower than the 5 year old JVM technology, readers would not
respect the newness of .NET. In reality, the legal people should have
talked to the technical people and realized that nearly all MS.NET
vs. Java benchmarks ALREADY come out with .NET on top and required
that every user publish at least one benchmark figure. :)

I can't wait for Generic IL.

(Although I've seen a few threading benchmarks where the JVM is
faster)
