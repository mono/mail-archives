The libapache2-mod-mono package for Debian is being tested right now.
When released, it'll be part of the Mono for Debian archive at
<A HREF="http://www.debianplanet.org/mono/.">http://www.debianplanet.org/mono/.</A> A lot of feedback has been taken to
make this work with the minimum of hassle, as we're aiming to make
Debian the easiest platform to use for .NET developers and users coming
from a Windows background.

It'll be possible to install a complete ASP.NET hosting environment on a
freshly installed Debian system with one command. apt-get install
libapache2-mod-mono will pull any necessary dependencies including
Apache 2 and the Mono JIT, and insert the necessary configuration file
directives.

There are still a couple of issues that make mod_mono difficult to use
in a real-world environment. Obviously it'd be sensible not to push
mod_mono to the masses until these issues are addressed.

There is also an RPM available on the mod_mono site, but I gather it
needs a certain amount of tweaking to get working.
