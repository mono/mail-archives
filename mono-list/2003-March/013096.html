Hello Mono Development Team,

My name is Evan Lim.  I am a member of the Bay.NET user group.  We are
an independent forum for sharing information on software development
with a focus on .NET technologies.   Most of our over 1500 registered
members live in Silicon Valley, San Francisco and the East Bay.  Our
members are predominatly Windows programmers; but we also have some Java
and Linux developers. We are the largest .NET user group in the country
and a charter member of INETA (International .NET Association,
www.ineta.org)

I am writing to you to ask for your help in promoting our next general
meeting to Linux developers in the San Francisco Bay Area.  The
presentation is titled &quot;Developing for .NET on Linux. The Mono Project&quot;
will be given by Christian Gross, a well-known developer and author.
The meeting will be held at the Microsoft Conference Center in Mountain
View, CA starting at 6:00 PM on Thursday, March 27.  For more
information on this presentation and the Bay.NET user group, please go
to www.baynetug.org.

Would be willing to forward an anouncement to your community, especially
those in the San Francisco Bay Area? If so, please reply to me at
<A HREF="mailto:evan_lim@pacbell.net.">evan_lim@pacbell.net.</A>

Thanks you very much for you assistance,

Evan Lim
Member of the Board, Bay.NET User Group
