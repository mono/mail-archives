Dear Mono Developers,

=20

I'd like to thank everyone that's working on this project. Being a more =
or
less evangelical Microsoft technologies consultant, you'll probably find =
it
surprising that I not only support Mono, but am avidly waiting for the =
day
that I can publish my VS.NET projects to my Debian Linux server.

=20

I think I bring an interesting perspective to your project too. Although =
I
run a linux server, I am by no means an expert. I still get extremely
frustrated with installing things when they simply don't work out of the
box. The expectations of linux software developers on linux users are
extraordinarily high if you ask me. But then again, some people get just =
as
frustrated with what is commonly called Microsoft Voodoo so I shouldn't
complain too much.

=20

But I do laugh at this because I feel rather confident that I have a =
clear
understanding of Microsoft voodoo and have leveraged that knowledge as a
senior consultant. So there's Linux voodoo and MS voodoo.

=20

Mono offers the hope of bridging that gap.

=20

So now you're getting very close to making my wishes come true and I =
want to
help. I can't write code since my career has always revolved around =
business
processes, not nuts and bolts development. I think there's a place for
people like me, but so far the focus of the Mono project has _been_ on =
the
nuts and bolts. That will very likely continue for awhile.

=20

But it seems to me that there's a void in the sense that there are
developers of the framework, but now you really need people to start =
_using_
it. You almost need to start a Mono Users Group or Developers Group. If
there is one, I'm unaware of it.

=20

Anyway, I have issues with the whole linux/apache voodoo part of this =
and
maybe it's inappropriate, but I'll toss these ideas out anyway:

=20

-          Is it possible to make the ASP.NET/Apache installation very =
fool
proof? I have found some typically rough install guides, but they only
mention Apache 2. I still run Apache 1.3 because I have many users on my
linux server and they've lobbied against Apache 2. So my request would =
be
that mod_mono have very clear, foolproof instructions or packages that =
work
with the latest official releases of Apache (1.3.27 and 2). The idea is =
that
someone like me (a business type developer with some knowledge of DEB's =
and
RPM's) could execute an install and have a sample website running
automatically. Samples for web forms in this installation would be
extraordinarily helpful. I have played with the Mono testing web server, =
but
I think mod_mono is really the killer app that needs to be pushed for =
people
like myself. Maybe there should be an automatically installed test =
website
under Apache that runs as localhost/monotest or something. I could help =
in
this are if you think it's a good idea.

-          Is it possible to show code behind functioning as it does in
ASP.NET/IIS? I've been doing .NET for 18 months now and nearly no one I =
know
recommends using inline script in their ASPX files. I would even go so =
far
as to say that code behind needs to be stressed and inline script should =
be
minimalized, but maybe that's my own opinion.

=20

I promise to work on testing things and reporting issues in the near =
future.
My focus is really from a business perspective (again). How can I write =
a
very typical presentation tier, business tier, and data tier in Mono
connected to a PostgreSQL or MySQL database? Well, I know how to write =
the
code in .NET and I know all the voodoo of .NET on IIS 5/6. I want to do
whatever it takes to help Mono start showing _real_ examples of this in
Linux/Apache. So the most important namespaces are System.Data,
System.Data.MySqlClient, System.Xml (less so), =
System.Web.UI.WebControls,
System.Web.UI.HtmlControls, and System.Collections. I'm sure I'm =
forgetting
something.

=20

Again - I love it and have been playing with it for awhile. It's =
installed
on my public server Plover.Net. If there's anything I can do for the =
Mono
project with my Windows 2003 Server RC2 (Placet.Com) or Plover.Net =
(Debian
Linux), please let me know.

=20

Thanks,

=20
