<PRE>Or you can change the mono install so that it doesn't quit when it has
problems with gc.h, with the following three steps:

	a. in gc_wrapper.h, insert at the beginning a line reading:
#define HAVE_GC_GC_H
	b. in configure.in, search for the line reading:

AC_MSG_ERROR(&quot;Found libgc but not its header files! You may need to install
them by hand.&quot;)

	Replace it with the following line:

	AC_MSG_WARN([*** gc.h workaround!])

	c. in configure.in, search for the line reading:

  	AC_MSG_ERROR(&quot;GC requested but header files not found! You may need to
install them by hand.&quot;)

	Replace it with the following line:

	AC_MSG_WARN([*** gc.h workaround!])

I also had to modify the mono-build-w32.sh script in two more places before
it would work:

1. I was not able to get the source code from cvs until I changed the
cvsroot away from that specified in the doc. My new cvsroot statement is:
export CVSROOT=:pserver:<A HREF="mailto:anonymous@anoncvs.go-mono.com">anonymous@anoncvs.go-mono.com</A>:/mono

2. The compile failed until I changed the ACLOCAL_FLAGS variable.  My new
statement is:
export ACLOCAL_FLAGS=&quot;-I /home/install/share/aclocal&quot;
Note too that it is not immediately obvious which path to pick, since there
are many aclocal directories and files.  It would be helpful to tell the
reader how to discern which aclocal path to use.


I tried the AUTO_DEVEL fix but it didn't work for me: the compilation bombed
a bit later, returning error code 2.  It probably depends a lot on what
version of autoconf you have installed.

Regards,
	Vincent
