It depends on your requirements.  I will ask some questions.

What platforms will you run mono?

What kind of hardware do you anticipate using?

What is your budget?

How many users or maximum connections do you anticpate?

Will you have multiple databases scattered around the world?  Another words,
is distributed databases and replication technology important to you?

Do you think you will need things like stored procedures, triggers,
transactions?

Mono has support for many data sources: XML, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server,
Sybase,
MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Lite, Firebird/Interbase, IBM DB2 Universal Database,
and ODBC.

If a data source is not supported, it should not be hard to create a new
using the various interfaces provided in ADO.NET like IDbConnection,
IDbCommand, IDataReader, and IDataAdapter, etc...   Also, if the data source
is not listed above, there is a good chance that the data source has ODBC
support which Mono's implementation of ADO.NET has.

I will not compare the differences between the various DBMS engines out
there; this should be done by your own research which is better.  However, I
can compare the various providers in Mono.

Microosoft SQL Server (System.Data.SqlClient) is actively developed and is
very usuable.

PostgreSQL (Npgsql) is actively developed.

MySQL (ByteFX.Data.MySQLClient) is actively developed.

Oracle (System.Data.OracleClient) is actively developed, but has problems on
Windows.  Hopefully, this will change.

IBM DB2 (Mono.Data.DB2Client) is actively developed, and I hear it works.

The other providers work, but are not actively developed much.

ODBC (System.Data.Odbc) works on Windows and Linux.

PostgreSQL (Mono.Data.PostgreSqlClient) works, but is deprecated in favor of
Npgsql.

MySQL (Mono.Data.MySql) works, but is deprecated in favor of
ByteFX.Data.MySQLClient.

OLE DB (System.Data.OleDb) only works on Linux due to its underlying native
library libgda which only works Linux.

SQL Lite (Mono.Data.SqliteClient) works.

Sybase (Mono.Data.SybaseClient) I hear works, but may have bit-rotted.

TdsClient (Mono.Data.TdsClient) for older Sybase and Microsoft SQL Server
database.   I hear it
works, but may have bit-rotted.

I don't know the status of Firebird/Interbase though since it is a
completely separate project.

Subject: [Mono-list] Database with the best support in mono?


In all the .net apps I write I'm trying to make them as easily comatible
with mono as possible.  One that I'll be writing shortly uses a database,
and I was wondering which has/will have the best support?
