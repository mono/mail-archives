It's not because &quot;these are probably the interface methods other users
might care about&quot;.

I add throws only to public methods because I'm trying to annotate the
minimum set of methods and still have checked exceptions. I admit
there are some tricky issues with protected methods in subclasses, but
no first draft proposal is perfect.

&gt;<i> Let's say you want to create an iterator that implements the
</I>&gt;<i> java.util.Iterator interface class. Let's say that itertor should
</I>&gt;<i> iterate some database stuff.  Every database operator might throw an SQL
</I>&gt;<i> exception (a checked exception). But the Iterator interface doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> allow you to throw exceptions, as potential users of iterators might not
</I>&gt;<i> deal with them.  So you have to  wrap your checked exceptions with
</I>&gt;<i> uncheckt runtime exceptions, working around the too strict default
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism.  That's annoying.
</I>
That's a really good example. 

My problems with checked exceptions mostly have to do with them
getting in my way for a temporary period of time while I'm starting
development on some new code. Your example is actually a case where
checked exceptions break language behavior. I'll add that issue to my
proposal.

&gt;<i> I wouldn't mind if I don't have to add declarations to non-public
</I>&gt;<i> methods though.
</I>
Ahh, so you see the point now. :)

&gt;<i> However, as especially protected methods are meant to be overwritten
</I>&gt;<i> by other users in their subclasses, these methods might also need a
</I>&gt;<i> throws declaration.
</I>
This certainly is an interesting case to handle. I'll add it to my
proposal.

&gt;<i> I agree with you, that the whole matter could need some thought.  Do
</I>&gt;<i> you know Bruce Eckel's position paper on not using checked
</I>&gt;<i> exceptions already?
</I>
Yes, of course. However, I don't agree with him. I agree that Java's
&quot;thorough checked exceptions&quot; system is overkill and
annoying. However, I find throws declarations in public class methods
to be extremely helpful when writing Java code. I just find it
annoying to have to add declarations for my code when the compiler
could do a fine job. Inferring thrown exceptions is not hard like
ML-style type inference -- It's trivial.


&gt;<i> [snip...] higher performacne isn't something I really care about. 
</I>
Then I won't bother with any of the performance
conversation. Obviously it's important to me. It's also important to a
few other people I'm sure.

&gt;<i> &gt; C# is faster at (a) and (b) by using C++ style static vtable lookups
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for methods. &quot;really fancy&quot; Smalltalk runtimes like the SELF/Smalltalk
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; runtime which eventually became hotspot can sometimes optimize out
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this overhead at runtime if a single type appears in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hashtable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What you call &quot;really fancy&quot; is actually the norm - not considering
</I>&gt;<i> simple interpreter like Squeak or Dolphin Smalltalk.
</I>
The SELF runtime basically invented polymorphic inline caches. Their
Smalltalk-&gt;SELF emulation environment for Smalltalk was about 4x
faster than Digitalk Smalltalk (from memory). It also took a buttload
of memory. Sun's Java Hotspot VM was one of the first commercial
runtimes to include polymorphic inline caches. If you have a
documented reference to a non-SELF, non-Hotspot VM which does this,
I'd like to see it.

&gt;<i> Intel's research implemententation uses PICs.
</I>
Do you have a documented reference you can point me to?

AFAIK, non-Hotspot runtimes are limited to simple inlining, they don't
really do type-specific, multi-method call &quot;polymorphic inline caches&quot;
like SELF does. I've talked with David Ungar about some of the
challenges converting SELF's PICs into Hotspot, and it really wasn't a
no-brainer. It also isn't a clear win, as Java VMs without it do
better in some cases.

&gt;<i> Another problem with simple vtables occur with interfaces
</I>
The C++ multiple inheritence vtable dispatch mechanism is pretty damn
fast compared to Java/Smalltalk/Objective-C style dispatch. It's
perfectly capable of doing Interfaces. Obviously enough inlining
(aside from memory usage, complexity, and compiler pauses) can
optimize all of these into something simpler.

&gt;<i> Actually, using inlining the SELF way, you'd get the same advantage
</I>&gt;<i> without generics and everywhere, not only in collections.  Some help
</I>&gt;<i> form the user can however of course simplify and speed up the JIT
</I>&gt;<i> compiler.
</I>
I've run the SELF environment and written SELF code and IMO, we are a
LONG way from SELF being anywhere near the performance of Java or C#,
even with all that fancy stuff, let alone C++.

All that stuff is interesting in theory, but the system really took
tons of memory and still wasn't fast. The SELF VM was amazing because
it took a totally impractical message passing meta-language and made
it faster than then-current Smalltalk runtimes.
