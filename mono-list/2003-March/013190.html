<PRE>The Windows-world equivilant is known as &quot;Windows DNA&quot; (Windows
Internet Applications Architecture). It offers the same concept
without the openness. That is, XYZ Corp can buy a WDNA application and
install it on their existing WDNA environment. The trick is that there
is only one WDNA environment, and it comes from Microsoft. Here is a=20
component for component comparison:
---------------------------------------
Windows DNA is being completely replaced by .NET/ServicedComponents and =
Web
services. In the end, the new Microsoft GXA takes it's place (GXA is =
just
web services and EnterpriseServices on top of XML with WS-Transactions,
Security, Identity and Reliable Messaging).=20

  C#/.NET handles the transaction part of this with MTS. The gap is
  the binding of a component to the transaction services.
-----------------------------------------------------
That's not completely true. If you don't use cross process .NET, MTS is
never used. If you do distributed transactions cross multiple processes =
(say
oracle/et all) then you do use MTS or a BYOT manager. To bind a =
component to
be transactional, you simply derive from ServicedComponent and throw a
[Transaction] Attribute in front of your class. If you want, you can =
even be
lazy about it and tell it to interpret a lack of exception as a vote for =
a
transaction (using a 2 phased commit).

  Microsoft has &quot;Microsoft Message Queueing&quot;. I don't know how this
  works.
---------------------------------------------
MMQ but there is also something called loosely coupled events which does =
not
require MMQ.
