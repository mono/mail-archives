I used the script and it worked for me, if you get errors, you should
file bug reports about them or (better) send patches to fix them.

It works flawlessly on linux, though I agree cygwin is not always a
perfect fit for reproducing a unixy environment on windows.
The windows programmers that want to use a different build process are
welcome to contribute an nmake makefile or whatever they think makes the
build process in windows easier for them. So far I think nobody stepped
up to contribute that; if we missed a patch that does that, please
remind us so that we can include it in the tarballs and in cvs.

&gt;<i> Final question (for now), why can't both the Windows and Unix builds use the
</I>&gt;<i> same Nant file?
</I>
Well, I think the question should be:
why can't the windows build use makefiles? :-)
Part of the reason is that until recently mono couldn't run nant, but
even now, I wouldn't switch the build to use nant on unix, because I
find makefiles so much nicer, both to maintain and to use.
