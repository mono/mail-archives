<PRE>Hi,

I have a RH8.0 box with mono-0.23 installed from RPMs. I have compiled a
couple of small programs on it without any problem but I am getting a lot of
warnings compiling ModMono.dll. The result of this compilation (ModMono.dll)
crashes my apache 2.0.44 everytime I try to access /mono. The xsp server
works fine when started as a standalone application. I also tried with the
code in cvs as it was last night with the same results. The apache module
(mod_mono.so) compiles and installs without any problem.

It seems there is a problem with my mono install, I removed the installed
RPMs and made sure there was no remaining files on the system and then
installed again the RPMs getting the same results.

Is there anything I can do to make it work?

Thanks

RJ
