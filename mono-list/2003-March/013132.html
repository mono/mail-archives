<PRE>I have a working mono install from 0.23.

Here are the issues that I'm aware of.

If you used fink for your glib, you probably will get an error about the
us_EN language and a failure to convert UTF-8 (assuming a us_EN system,
something that probably isn't a safe assumption, but hey, I'm an American
and everyone knows that we have no concept of internationalization, can you
say 'ZIP CODE'?)

You can run limited things using mono, however you will see errors,
especially if you install the Boehm garabage collection.

If you have compiled it with libgc, you will get a 'bus error'.

Further, code generated by mcs on OS X will not run on other platforms.  So,
at this point, it's still incomplete.

I believe after my basic analysis that the many of the problems all share a
common root in the fink glib.  I've been looking at glib and the OS X
patches to see what problems may exist there.  Once that problem is solved,
I think the next step will be to begin debugging the libgc problems, to
bring parity to the build environments between Cygwin, Linux, and OS X.
Then we can talk about debugging mcs, mono and mint to bring them to proper
parity with the x86 implementations.
