You weren't &quot;just lucky.&quot;  Mono and .NET use the same intermediate
language, so .NET executables/assemblies should run under Mono...

...As long as the dependencies are met. :-)  Running a csc-compiled
Windows.Forms application under Mono won't work, using unimplemented
parts of the Base Class Library won't work, strongly-named shared
assemblies aren't currently supported, etc.

So recompiling your application under Mono can be an easy way to see if
you're using anything that hasn't been implemented (or stubbed out) in
Mono.  However, since the class may only be stubbed out, successful
compilation doesn't ensure successful execution.

&gt;<i> 2) I am curious to find out what is and is not supposed to work in the

</I>&gt;<i> what those todos are.
</I>
Alas, I can't help you here.

&gt;<i> 3) I am getting the following error:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> WARNING **:Could not load class from token 0x01000022 in
</I>&gt;<i> /home/tom/netTest/oai.utility.dll
</I>&gt;<i> WARNING **:Missing method Validate in assembly
</I>&gt;<i> /home/tom/netTest/oai.utility.dll typeref index 33
</I>
No idea here, either.
