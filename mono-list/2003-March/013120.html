The new JIT is not yet in the public cvs, the plan is to publish it
in a few days. Basic things work on MacOSX with the new jit, but
this doen't mean it's the same basic things that you're looking for:-)
People that want to help with the macosx port don't need to wait for the
port, though, there is plenty of things to do that no one has stepped up
to do (or contribute), yet:
*) io-layer/atomic.h: ppc asm version of the functions there
*) dllimport: we currently use GModule and the code in glib doesn't
handle shared libraries. Someone should investigate about using dlopen
in GModule or adding a wrapper in mono
*) there are reports of issues when linking libgc: using
the jit runtime instead of the interp runtime is not going to make
it easier to debug this issue
*) running mcs sometimes results in an illegal instruction trap: again,
debugging this issue won't be easier with the jit

So, if you want to help, there are plenty of things that need you.
