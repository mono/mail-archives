<PRE>Hi Eran,

&gt;<i> An apache module will hide this kind of functionality from 
</I>&gt;<i> the user. An HttpModule must be registered in the web.config 
</I>&gt;<i> file, thus forcing every application that needs to handle 
</I>&gt;<i> this to add that line.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Putting this code at the Apache module level removes the need 
</I>&gt;<i> to add the configuration to the web.config file.
</I>&gt;<i> After all, it seems logical that in Windows almost no one 
</I>&gt;<i> will use it and if they do it will be in a very different way.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why make them some extra job of removing lines from the web.config?
</I>&gt;<i> After all, it is not imperative to have such functionality in 
</I>&gt;<i> Windows (even on Apache on Windows).
</I>
I'm not sure on that, I think there is solutions out there that would
like to have that on Windows to. I have made IIS Filters to fix that
before for customers.
 
&gt;<i> I think that it is important to implement multiple paths per 
</I>&gt;<i> Application Host. This kind of behavior will probably be 
</I>&gt;<i> required by users that will be familiar with IIS 6. 
</I>
I don't think so. IIS 6 has multiple Application Hosts (one per running
application) in an farm. We should support the same kind of
functionality but it's a lot of work to construct that for Apache but it
will bring Apache to the same level as IIS 6 when it comes to
application isolation.
 
&gt;<i> It might also be necessary to allow the host to run on a 
</I>&gt;<i> different user (if this it is possible). For enhanced 
</I>&gt;<i> security we will need to run the host on different 
</I>&gt;<i> credentials so the Application Host we have very limited 
</I>&gt;<i> access to resources.
</I>
Again, there is a lot of work to create this kind of isolation but when
it's done you can easily support running each app host with different
users.
 
Cheers, 
 Patrik
