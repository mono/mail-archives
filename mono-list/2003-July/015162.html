NAnt is a free .NET build tool. In theory it is kind of like make without
make's wrinkles. In practice it's a lot like Ant. NAnt has been tested with
the .NET 1.0 and 1.1 releases.
There is preliminary support for Mono 0.25 and several other runtime
configurations.
The project website is <A HREF="http://nant.sourceforge.net/">http://nant.sourceforge.net/</A>

Text version of changes since RC1:
USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
 *  Built with .NET 1.0 
 This release candidate is built with version 1.0 of the .NET Framework. The
binaries for RC1 had been built with version 1.1, which had backwards
compatibility issues. 

 *  Fixed defect: temp directory leak in &lt;solution&gt; task 
 Matthew Mastracci fixed a major temp directory leak. It was leaking approx.
one temp directory per project! You should clear your Local Settings\Temp
directory for the user you use to build your solutions. 

 *  &lt;solution&gt; VB.NET support 
 The &lt;solution&gt; task now supports VB.NET projects. This was meant to be part
of the RC1 release. 

 *  Matthew Mastracci has also checked in support for reading resources of
VB projects and generating the appropriate dependent resource name. 

 *  Documentation for NAntContrib 
 This release candidate includes the binaries and documentation for the
NAntContrib extensions. Note that the source is still distributed seperately
during this release cycle.
