I tend to agree with Linus on this one, as for the first 10 years of my=20
programming career I didn't have or use any debuggers and I am certain it h=
as=20
made me a far better programmer today :-) I can usually model and run all t=
he=20
code in my head, before I whack it into the machine a skill some of the tea=
m=20
at my work don't seem to possess (mainly I reckon cause they fire up the=20
debugger too soon).

On the other hand 20,000 lines of someone elses code is a lot to grapple wi=
th=20
when porting from one OS to another and having a peak at code flow and=20
variable values can save masses of time. I'm only using Kate as my editor a=
s=20
well, so I already don't have Intellisense, context sensitive help, or the=
=20
&quot;goto definition&quot; function I love so much. Still, progress is incredibly=20
rapid, due mainly I'd say to two things:

1. The guys (work programming team who wrote the software I am about to=20
convert) did a top notch job on the coding.
2. You and the Mono team have done an incredible job matching the API with =
the=20
MS API. I have 17,000 lines already compiled and at least mostly working in=
 1=20
day and with only 4 lines of code changed (damn back slashes).

I'm pretty hopeful I can get the code across, and even get it performing we=
ll=20
too...now I gotta try and see if I can convince the company to Open Source =
it=20
once I have done the conversion *sigh*. It's a very neat content management=
=20
system BTW.
