<PRE>Yikes- seems like it should be pretty basic. Can you put the files on a
regular FTP/Web server?

I have had the same problem in the past on windows.  (I assume you are 
using windows).  The best way around it that I have found is to either 
use a browser other than IE, to use lwp-rget, or to download the sources 
from cvs and attempt to compile that way.
