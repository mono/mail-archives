I think you may be confused because of how I mixed up a few
comments. Let me clarify:

1) I'm plenty happy making my own struct which has no elements and
   using it as a strongly typed pointer. My code looks like this, and
   I'm happy with it:

    unsafe struct NEOERR { 
      // this one has members, non-opaque
    };
    unsafe struct HDF { }; // opaque
    unsafe struct CSP { }; // opaque
    // more opaque types

    [Dllimport(&quot;libneo.dll&quot;)] extern static NEOERR *hdf_init(HDF **);


2) I find it really dangerous that S.W.F exposes HWND* structures as
   IntPtr. Any method in an assembly that is accessable that takes an
   IntPtr as a paramater or which lets you access an IntPtr as a
   public field can be used to crash the runtime by sticking the
   wrong type of IntPtr there. This seems &quot;really bad&quot;. 

   It seems like this might have been done to support VB's common use
   of &quot;ByRef HWND as Long&quot; since it dosn't have pointer types. Ohh
   well.

In response to your comment. I already have a managed type which wraps
the HDF*. The thing is, I have a few different components of my
wrapper which need access to the raw HDF*. Wrapping a void*
(i.e. IntPtr) in another level of managed type seems needless and
performance-sapping when the unsafe HDF* does exactly what I want, not
to mention un-type-safe.

I'm plenty happy with how this works now.. (although I have run into
some other interesting issues.. more later)
