This Monodoc XML format is based upon the XML documentation made
available by ECMA. A 'TypeKind' element is not available because the
existing ECMA docs don't have them either.

The format used by the Gtk# documentation project is a slightly altered
format that is based on the ECMA format. We added a RefType attribute to
parameters to help distinguish between ref and out parameters.

Since the current Gtk# monodoc browser is able to do distinguish between
the different kinds of Types, I don't think it's worthwhile to alter the
XML file once more. To find out how monodoc figures this out, see
ecma-provider.cs ( I think).

&gt;<i> BTW. What's the reason for having lots of MemberSignature[@Language='C#']
</I>&gt;<i> all over the files? Signatures for other languages aren't provided. Why? CLI
</I>&gt;<i> is all about multiple languages...
</I>
In the ECMA documentation, IL signatures are also available. I think
that's the reason why they have a Language attribute to distinguish
between the two.

Duncan.
