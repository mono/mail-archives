I have been thinking about this issue for some time now, and the more I
think about it, the more of a serious issue it seems to be. Collection
types are very commonly used, and if they are not compatible with remoting
between MS .NET and mono, an entire section of the market (so to say) will
be unavailable.

It would in theory be possible to provide mono's remoting with some thunks
to translate the binary format of collections to/from Microsoft-equivalent
formats, right within the remoting layer. How much work would this be? I
might be able to contribute it myself, but I am not sure where to start.

I can't think of any reason why a solution such as this would be inherently
contrary to mono's vision, but if such reasons exist please let me know :-)
