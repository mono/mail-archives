<PRE>Looks like my PInvoke and Marshaling lesson is done. Thanks again for
the great help! This post is just a few general discussion comments on
IntPtr wrt VB and Security.

Is there a way to disallow an assembly from calling any function which
takes an IntPtr paramater or void* paramater? It seems to me that this
would be required to stop sandboxed code from segfaulting the
system. Otherwise I can just hand an HWND IntPtr I get from &quot;secure
ok&quot; S.W.F code, and hand it to &quot;secure ok&quot; Gtk code, and poof. :)

I guess this is my confusion. HWND* is _safer_ than IntPtr, because it
is a pointer to a specific type. It's the operations on HWND* that are
unsafe. It seems like it would be better if VB (and other languages
without unsafe) had the ability to express HWND*, and simply not
operate on it.

Certainly this:
    .field  public   valuetype HDF* p

Is better than this:
    .field  public   native int p

Ohh well... maybe it'll get in the queue for .NET 2.0. although I'm
much more excited about parametric types than I am worried about this.
