  Originally, I was using the Microsoft Shared Source.  I would modify
the source code for the ArrayList class and rebuild everything and then
I could use whatever I have added to the ArrayList collection in a C#
program.

have to do to use any changes I make to that source code?

Are you not able to achieve the results you want through inheritence? I
would have thought it safer to inherit from that class and add any extra
features you need than to re-implement and change the base class. I once
went down the path of reworking library code for my own means (in this
case, putting drop shadows on a text windowing library) and it meant I
had to re-do the work every time a new release of the library came out.
Not a pretty sight as I did this for the third time.

Anyway, hack the code if that's what floats your boat, but also consider
the OO methods of doing things if they are indeed available (I'm
assuming this isn't a sealed class).
