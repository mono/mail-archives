<PRE>I am looking for cross platform (Windows and RedHat Linux) application
(WindowForm with dll) solution.  

(1)	Mono with X-develop is what I have tried first.  After I quickly
created a Window.Form application using Windows mono 2.4 and X-develop,
I can run it from RedHat Linux using &quot;mono myapps.exe&quot; command with mono
version 1.9.1 that I got from website for my RedHat Linux.  It looks ok.
After reading Mono-list, I am not sure whether my application which will
need to include Windows dll (written in VC++ in dll and wrapped by .NET
C# as dll) will work by using Mono together with X-develop environment?
(2)	I know that Mono version is upto 2.4 now.  Do not see a package
from mono website for RedHat.  What should I do to (or where I can) get
a version 2.4 mono framework for Linux RedHat 2.6 version (which should
work with X-develop Linux version also)?

I am new to Mono and (pretty new) to Linux.  If there are other choice
to cross platform RedHat Linux and Windows for my Window.Form
application with .NET C# dll, I would like to hear about it.

Thanks,
Jerry
