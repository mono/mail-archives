<PRE>Hi everyone,
I have a program using GTk# and c# I am writing with monodevelop on an
Opensuse 11.1 system. I can run the code with no major problems stand
alone outside the monodevelop environment on this os.  I copied the code
over to Ubuntu 8.4 with the 1.9  enhancements, program runs but I do get
crashes when I try to do some tasks which dont crash on Opensuse. I also
built windows binary and tried to run that on an XP with latest mono +
GTk on it (examples work ok). The outline frame starts showing the
program name then everything crashes. I should say that I am using the
OpenTK openGl toolkit but an old version.

So my question is how can I track down the problems and get my code to
run on both Ubuntu and XP?  Does mono on the pc write anything to a log
file and if so where is it, I looked at the system logs but nothing
there. Are there specific gotcha's that I am missing with reference to
both these os's?

I would be grateful for any information.

Alan
