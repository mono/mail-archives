Hi,

(This is roughly the same message as was mistakenly on the ASP.NET section,
but with the vital point that it's Novell LDAP, not MS LDAP!)

My client requires us to connect to their Novell LDAP system through SSL
with the ASP.NET (2.0) application we have written, which is going to run on
Windows 2003 Server through IIS6.  For the moment I am using a simple
console application to test my code - a lot easier and simpler that
uploading the rather large web application dlls each time.

&gt;<i>From everything I've read, it appears that Mono is the best solution to
</I>this, but I'm having a great deal of difficulty getting it to work.

I have added the novell.directory.ldap.dll and mono.security.dll references
to the console app, and included the dlls in &quot;installation&quot; directory on the
server.
I have installed Mono (2.4.2.3) but not included the GTK part, as I don't
believe it's necessary.
I have added the security certificate from the clients LDAP system into the
Trust store using certmgr.

But when I attempt a secure bind to the Novell LDAP server, I receive a 91
Connect Error, with the IOException of &quot;The authentication or decryption has
failed&quot; and TlsException of &quot;Invalid certificate received from server&quot;.

What have I missed?
Am I trying to achieve the impossible... or have I missed a simple step out? 
(Do I need to set an application setting or environment variable that I'm
not aware of?)

Many thanks for any help,
Cheers,
Tom
