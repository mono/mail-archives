<PRE>
Sorry for being a bother folks, but I'm finding all of this a little
confusing. I'm a &quot;Windows only&quot; guy and I still don't understand what the
steps are to perform AOT using Mono on Mac. My app is pure WinForms and I'm
running a VS2008-generated binary on the Mono platform when running my app
on Linux or OSX. I know next to nothing about OSX / Linux and have been
relying on others to install Mono on their machines and run my app whenever
I need to test a new build. The Linux performance is good enough with JIT,
but the OSX performance is a little slow so I was hoping that AOT would help
here. My app is also doing a ton of startup stuff, so AOT would hopefully
help there too.

My understanding is that if I want to make use of the AOT feature, I first
precompile the app using &quot;mono --aot -O=all MyApp.exe&quot;. Then I invoke the
precompiled app via &quot;mono MyApp.exe.so SomeCommandLineArgumentMyAppNeeds&quot;.
Is all this correct?

I'm doing all of my development on a Windows 7 box, but I suppose that in
order to perform a full AOT for OSX I need to perform the above steps on OSX
which, according to Apple, has Xcode installed by default? Is there anything
else that needs to be installed on the OSX box other than Mono itself in
order to get this working? I'm really only interested in AOT on OSX, not
Linux.

Again, sorry for all the questions, but the documentation is just not doing
it for me. I really appreciate all the help.
