AOT won't improve the performance of a WinForms app under OS X.

</I>
No, the second step is just

mono MyApp.exe SomeCommandLineArgumentMyAppNeeds

The runtime will pick the precompiled assembly automatically.

</I>
Xcode is not installed by default. And yes, these steps must be
performed on an Intel OS X. AOT is not supported on PPC machines.
