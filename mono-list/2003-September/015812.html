<PRE>&gt;<i> I've only just picked up on this thread, so excuse me if some of this has
</I>&gt;<i> already been said.

</I>&gt;<i> I agree with Davy. I don't want to learn GTK+ just to learn GTK#.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you just want skeleton API documentation to get you started why not run
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> GTK# assemblies through ndoc. I'm not sure if ndoc will run on mono. The
</I>&gt;<i> worst
</I>&gt;<i> case is compiling the GTK# source and generating the XML doc files
</I>&gt;<i> locally,
</I>&gt;<i> then using ndoc to either produce .chm help file or MSDN style html api
</I>&gt;<i> docs.
</I>
Yes, but if I'm not wrong, XML files produced by monodoc cannot be
processed directly with ndoc... monodoc generates an XML file for
each corresponding *.cs file, while ndoc exprects a single XML file
for each assembly.

The mono project does not embed the documentation into the code.
Instead, XML skeleton are generated with monodoc starting from the
compiled assemblies.

</I>&gt;<i> I'm a little surprised no-one has done this yet. This could be a useful
</I>&gt;<i> contribution to the GTK# project. If there's no takers, I'll happily do
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does this sound useful?

</I>&gt;<i> ---------- Original Message -----------
</I>&gt;<i> [snip]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unfortunately i don't have the time to learn GTK+ and then start using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gtk#.  Most people won't be willing to learn GTK+ just because they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need it to use gtk# in a way that allows them to write advanced GUI
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> applications.  It's kinda like telling people they need to learn C
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> before they can learn C#.  I wanna be able to use gtk# efficiently
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without having to learn GTK+.  And i'm sure many people feel the same
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way about this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Once again, i do not want to offend the people that work on mono.  On
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the contrary, i'm very happy with the things that are already possible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with mono.  I just want to point out that for those of us who don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have any gtk+ experience, it's frustrating to learn gtk# due to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> current level of the documentation.  And yea i've already received
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> plenty of &quot;it's a developing project so do your part and write the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> documentation yourself&quot; mails so don't bother pointing that out.  I'd
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be willing to help out in the documentation part, but it's kinda hard
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to write documentation about stuff
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (methods/events/...) you didn't even know existed isn't it?  Now of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> course i can't expect the documentation to be as good as the one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> available at MSDN.  But it would be nice to at least have a complete
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> API reference (all the extra eplanation isn't even necessary... just a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> list of everything the class has to offer would be nice) which would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be easily accessible (for instance in HTML form like that GTK+ API
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> documentation that you mentioned).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All i'm saying is that if you want people to use mono and gtk#, then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't expect them to learn GTK+ first or to have GTK+ experience.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> People who don't know GTK+ but who want to learn GTK# won't like being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> told &quot;learn GTK+ first and then you'll be able to use GTK# well
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enough&quot;.  As i said before, it's like telling people to learn C before
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they can learn C# and we all know that's not necessary.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kind regards,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> davy brion
