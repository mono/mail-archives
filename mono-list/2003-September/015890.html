<PRE>One of the great features of the Windows version of .NET
framework is that several thousand controls and components
have already been developed. Unfortunately, these have not
yet been ported to Mono. Most of these may never be ported
because many of these components rely on interfaces to
underlying COM objects and the Win32 API and make use of
the evil P/Invoke.

Now that Mono is becoming highly functional, has anyone
considered doing an analysis to see what the most needed
components/controls might be and starting a group to
develop these controls. For example, a reporting tool like
Crystal Reports would probably be high on the list. Other
controls would be similar to the suites developed by
Infragistics and ComponentOne.

Were a large number of controls and components to be made
available for Mono, it would definitely impact (positively)
the acceptance of the framework by the .NET community. If
the controls were FREE, this would be an added incentive to
switch to .NET. All of the above mentioned companies have
VERY EXPENSIVE price tags on their products. 

I am certainly interested in assisting in such an endeavor
as developing .NET controls for mono. Are there others with
a similar interest? If so, where do we go from here?
