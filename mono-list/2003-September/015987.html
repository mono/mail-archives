<PRE>Hi all,

a while back I considered/tried implementing a WebDAV server in ASP.NET on IIS5
using IHTTPHandler and IHTTPModule interfaces. It seemed like a cool idea, only
I got stopped pretty quick because IIS would not (although I said my
Handler accepted ALL VERBs) pass the requests (in particular I hung up right
away on the OPTIONS command) on to my httphandler, for example:

========= Outbound Message =========
OPTIONS / HTTP/1.1
Host: d-6-ct-01
Connection: TE
TE: trailers, deflate, gzip, compress
User-Agent: UCI DAV Explorer/0.82 RPT-HTTPClient/0.3-3E
Translate: f
Accept-Encoding: deflate, gzip, x-gzip, compress, x-compress


========= Inbound Message ========= HTTP/1.1 200 OK Server: Microsoft-IIS/5.0
Date: Fri, 19 Sep 2003 09:45:20 GMT Connection: close MS-Author-Via: DAV
Content-Length: 0 Accept-Ranges: none DASL: &lt;DAV:sql&gt; DAV: 1, 2 Public: OPTIONS,
TRACE, GET, HEAD, DELETE, PUT, POST, COPY, MOVE, MKCOL, PROPFIND, PROPPATCH,
LOCK, UNLOCK, SEARCH Allow: OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, HEAD, COPY, PROPFIND, SEARCH,
LOCK, UNLOCK
Cache-Control: private

Though the request should have gone to my HTTPHandler, IIS wanted to answer it
itself. :-(

Would my idea be conceivable in mod_mono or XSP? I have not tried it yet because
my XSP setup is messed up currently (and my backend would not (yet) run on
linux), but I might be more inspired if someone said &quot;yeah, sure it would
work...&quot;. :-)

Looking forward to your feedback!

Regards,
--chris


BTW: has anyone out there tried something like this on IIS? Could it be I am
doing somthing wrong and it really would work? I know it would go in ISAPI (or
have heard this...) but I am just barely keeping my head above water in c# and
c++ would push me too far my into the deep end ;-)
