</I>Given that Mono is now part of Novell, we have the resources to lean
back on Microsoft. Also, given that pnet is a GNU project, the FSF
lawyers would probably move quickly on Microsoft.
&gt;<i> 3.  What advice would you offer someone who wishes to develop a C#

</I>Develop it! You are not developing an application for Mono, you are
developing a *C#* application. The idea is to make it follow good design
guidelines so that your application can run on Windows, pnet, Mono,
Rotor, *ALL* the implementations.

If what you are really asking is &quot;is Mono here to stay; will my
application be able to run on Linux?&quot; the answer to both questions is
&quot;YES&quot;.
