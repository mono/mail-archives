allthough i appreciate the tutorials, i've already gone through them... the 
problem is when you want to do more advanced stuff.  The documentation 
currently isn't good enough to do that (ie: methods and events that aren't 
listed in the API documentation of gtk#)

this is the same as mono.ximian.com:8080 and as i said in my first mail, it's 
outdated and painfully slow.

that is very usefull if you're using GTK+
however, i wanna use gtk# so i'd prefer to use API documentation that actually 
uses the same programming language i use.

</I>
yes this is excellent documentation... i already had that one bookmarked :)
it doesn't have anything to do with gtk# however.

unfortunately i don't have the time to learn GTK+ and then start using gtk#.  
Most people won't be willing to learn GTK+ just because they need it to use 
gtk# in a way that allows them to write advanced GUI applications.  It's 
kinda like telling people they need to learn C before they can learn C#.  I 
wanna be able to use gtk# efficiently without having to learn GTK+.  And i'm 
sure many people feel the same way about this.

Once again, i do not want to offend the people that work on mono.  On the 
contrary, i'm very happy with the things that are already possible with mono.  
I just want to point out that for those of us who don't have any gtk+ 
experience, it's frustrating to learn gtk# due to the current level of the 
documentation.  And yea i've already received plenty of &quot;it's a developing 
project so do your part and write the documentation yourself&quot; mails so don't 
bother pointing that out.  I'd be willing to help out in the documentation 
part, but it's kinda hard to write documentation about stuff 
(methods/events/...) you didn't even know existed isn't it?  Now of course i 
can't expect the documentation to be as good as the one available at MSDN.  
But it would be nice to at least have a complete API reference (all the extra 
eplanation isn't even necessary... just a list of everything the class has to 
offer would be nice) which would be easily accessible (for instance in HTML 
form like that GTK+ API documentation that you mentioned).

All i'm saying is that if you want people to use mono and gtk#, then don't 
expect them to learn GTK+ first or to have GTK+ experience.  People who don't 
know GTK+ but who want to learn GTK# won't like being told &quot;learn GTK+ first 
and then you'll be able to use GTK# well enough&quot;.  As i said before, it's 
like telling people to learn C before they can learn C# and we all know 
that's not necessary.

kind regards,
davy brion
