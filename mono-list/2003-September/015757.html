<PRE>Hi all,
	I am sorry if this has already been said here, but I seem to have a
problem with the latest mono stuff in XD2. Before installing mono 0.26
and mono-wine-20030318-1.ximian.6.3 I was able to write small GTK#
applications. I installed said packages when they appeared on Red
Carpet, and have not written any GTK# apps since. This evening I wanted
to start a new app and found that I can't because libgtk-win32-2.0-0.dll
can't be found. I tried a simple GTK# 'Hello World' (from the tutorial,
and shown below) and even that didn't work. Does anyone have any idea
what might have happened? For info, I'm running an up-to-date XD2 on a
RedHat 9.0 x86 machine with:

$&gt; rpm -q mono mono-debuginfo mono-wine mono-wine-debuginfo mono-devel
wine wine-devel
mono-0.26-2.ximian.6.1
mono-debuginfo-0.26-2.ximian.6.1
mono-wine-20030318-1.ximian.6.3
mono-wine-debuginfo-20030318-1.ximian.6.3
mono-devel-0.26-2.ximian.6.1
wine-20030709-1rh9winehq
wine-devel-20030709-1rh9winehq


The program is :

// Start Hello.cs

using Gtk; 
using GtkSharp; 
using System; 

class Hello 
{ 
  static void Main() 
  { 
    Application.Init (); 
    Window window = new Window (&quot;helloworld&quot;); 
    window.Show(); 
    Application.Run (); 
  } 
}

//End Hello.cs

I compiled with :
mcs -r gtk-sharp Hello.cs

I ran it with :
mono Hello.exe

and got many, many lines of:

** (Hello.exe:4898): WARNING **: Failed to load library
./libgtk-win32-2.0-0.dll (libgtk-win32-2.0-0.dll):
./libgtk-win32-2.0-0.dll: cannot open shared object file: No such file
or directory


And indeed, I can't seem to find that file in /usr/ with :

find /usr/ -name libgtk-win32-2.0-0.dll



I would appreciate any help,
Thanks.

Mike
