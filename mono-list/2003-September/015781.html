<PRE>Hey guys,

i'm using mono 0.26 and gtk# 0.10

I'm a complete newbie to gtk and i must say that it is very frustrating to 
learn gtk due to the documentation.

I can't get monodoc running... i don't have most of the gnome libraries since 
i don't run gnome and installing gtk# from CVS (which is apparantly a 
requirement to get monodoc working) is not something i'd even consider since 
i'm writing an application that uses gtk# and i can't expect the users of my 
application to install gtk# from CVS.  So imagine my happyness when i found 
out about <A HREF="http://mono.ximian.com:8080.">http://mono.ximian.com:8080.</A>  However, the webserver hosting that 
documentation is sometimes painfully slow and today i've noticed that the 
documentation isn't even complete.  For instance: i wanted to find out which 
event i needed to handle to respond to a mouseclick on a row in a TreeView.  
I was surprised that i couldn't find an appropriate event to handle a 
mouseclick.  Then a quick google search showed me this: 
<A HREF="http://www.es.gnome.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/MonoTagEditor/Attic/main.cs?annotate=1.1&cvsroot=GNOME">http://www.es.gnome.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/MonoTagEditor/Attic/main.cs?annotate=1.1&amp;cvsroot=GNOME</A>
in which you can see that there are definitely more events than listed in the 
documentation on mono.ximian.com:8080 (including the ButtonPressEvent which 
seems to be the one i need).  

So now i'm wondering: what source should i use for documentation when it comes 
to gtk# ?  Having Gtk# CVS as a dependency of monodoc 0.6 is a huge problem 
to those of us who aren't involved in the development of mono or gtk# but who 
are actually trying to create applications for end users.  Isn't it possible 
to create some sort of downloadable html version of the documentation?  It 
sure would make life easier for many of us i think...   

Don't get me wrong... i'm very impressed with what the mono project has 
accomplished so far but if you want people to create GUI applications in Mono 
then you really should try to lower the learning curve for those of us who 
don't have any GTK experience.  Easily accessible documentation would 
definitely be a step in the right direction.

I hope i haven't offended anyone, but please think about this.

kind regards,
davy brion
