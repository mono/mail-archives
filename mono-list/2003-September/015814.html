<PRE>I didn't see the begining of this topic so I may have moved slightly off topic.

&gt;<i> Yes, but if I'm not wrong, XML files produced by monodoc cannot be
</I>&gt;<i> processed directly with ndoc... monodoc generates an XML file for
</I>&gt;<i> each corresponding *.cs file, while ndoc exprects a single XML file
</I>&gt;<i> for each assembly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The mono project does not embed the documentation into the code.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead, XML skeleton are generated with monodoc starting from the
</I>&gt;<i> compiled assemblies.
</I>
I wasn't talking about monodoc. Your right both methods differ and are largely 
exclusive. I know the mono project doesn't embed the docs into the source, but 
GTK# isn't mono.

The comment I was replying to was about getting (as a minimum) a skeleton 
description of the GTK# api as an aid to learning GTK#.

Although monodoc is generally more flexibly than standard cs xml docs (and yes 
I would like to see a monodoc of the GTK# api) I didn't realise you had monodoc 
in mind. My memory is a bit hazy about monodoc, but can't it generate some 
skeleton xml files based on the source tree? If so, wouldn't that at least give 
you namespace/class/member lists?

Brian.
