<PRE>Hi Michael

The information you give is a bit too scarce to really get a feeling of =
what you want to do.

&gt;&gt;<i>I have a prospect who is using progress Client on Windows to talk to a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Progress Database. he wants to put the Progress Client onto Linux. Is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>this something we can do using Mono?
</I>
Progress is available for Linux. You an go to their website, and do a =
search on Linux. [www.progress.com]
If the client software was written entirely in their 4GL (their =
executable files named *.r), you should be able to run it on Linux =
without recompiling - they have a runtime engine which is conceptually =
the same as .NET and Java principle - compile once - run everywhere. The =
Progress client is the runtime that will need to be deployed with their =
*.r files, and is entirely independent of Mono, as Progress is a =
commercial product.

If your client application was written in some other language (I assume =
that's why you posted here) then you will need to check if there are =
Windows-specific API calls, etc in the client code that may limit such a =
porting. In this case, you can always put the database server on a Linux =
box, and use ODBC/JDBC to access the database from a Windows box, just =
as you would with any Windows database. I think you would not need the =
Progress client at all in these cases, but check that with your Progress =
dealer.=20

Your question about Mono as I understand it then becomes one of being =
able to access a Progress ODBC driver from Mono. Have a look on =
www.go-mono.org There is an entry of May 20, 2003 about Openlink's =
involvement with the Mono project. When I worked on Progress a few years =
ago, Openlink was a major supplier of ODBC drivers for Progress, so your =
chances of accessing Progress from Mono may be pretty good. (I have =
never tried it myself).

Hope that I could help
