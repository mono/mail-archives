<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> &gt; Now that Mono is becoming highly functional, has anyone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; considered doing an analysis to see what the most needed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; components/controls might be
</I>&gt;<i> None that I know of.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  and starting a group to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; develop these controls. For example, a reporting tool like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Crystal Reports would probably be high on the list.
</I>&gt;<i> Crystal Reports is HUGE, I think it needs to be tackled by its own
</I>&gt;<i> development team.
</I>
Mono is becoming highly functional, but by no means finished. Of course it
is a good idea, but wouldn't these resources be better spent on the mono
project itself?

&gt;<i> I think one of the major steps can actually be taken quicker, and
</I>&gt;<i> involves virtually 0 effort. Right now there are 100's of C# projects on
</I>&gt;<i> SourceForge. We really need a team to look at the ones that are
</I>&gt;<i> alpha/beta/production quality, and attempt to get them running on Mono.
</I>&gt;<i> I know that in one weekend I was able to catch 3 or 4 bugs just by
</I>&gt;<i> trying to get BlogX running on Mono (it now works great, thanks to our
</I>&gt;<i> friend Gonzalo!). These apps are test cases waiting for use. Also,
</I>&gt;<i> GotDotNet workspaces would provide a source of possible test cases.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As well, it would be nice if we could lean a bit on the C# Open Source
</I>&gt;<i> community and request that they include makefiles with their apps and
</I>&gt;<i> attempt to make them Mono friendly. I think the best way to go about
</I>&gt;<i> this might be to create a set of &quot;Mono QuickStarts&quot; that spotlight Open
</I>&gt;<i> Source software that works out-of-the-box on Mono -- alot of projects
</I>&gt;<i> will try to meet that description.
</I>
Now this is a wonderful idea! A sort of &quot;Mono-certified ;) &quot; projects
gallery :). That would be a splendid idea indeed.

Greetz,
