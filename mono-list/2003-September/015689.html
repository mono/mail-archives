</I>I was planning to support MS OleDb's connection string format, so that
you can easily port applications from windows. The problem is that I ran
out of time, and since then I haven't been able to hack too much on
Mono.

But, yes, it was planned at that time. And if you really need it, it
would be great if you could add that compatibility layer.

cheers
