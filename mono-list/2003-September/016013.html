 &gt; Thanks a lot for your reply. Yes it helps. But what about an IDE?
 &gt; Is mono like MS's framework, or is an IDE like VS.net included?
 &gt; Or are there free IDE's which can be used ?

Ideally, there should be a linux/mono friendly ide for use with the mono
version of .Net ... For the time being, you can build with VS, and deploy
with mono, for the most part.. need to be carefull of objects that are not
yet implimented in mono... beyond this, you may want to try using a good
text editor, and get used to using the command line compilers, this is what
I use for .net (mostly windows) anyhow.. just recently started with mono.

Alternatively, #develop is a 3rd party IDE currently supported on windows,
but I know they are going to work on a mono/gtk# port of this as mono
matures, and becomes more complete... <A HREF="http://www.icsharpcode.net/">http://www.icsharpcode.net/</A> then click
on the link for SharpDevelop (#develop).  Eventually whatever you build on
one side should be deployable in either... for the time veing Ms's .net is
more complete (because they made the thing)... some aspects of mono are
incomplete, but mostly functional... it just takes some testing, I am working
on a couple projects, and would ideally like them to work under either,
but it means that I have to test every little piece in both.

On this line, is anyone using ByteFX.Data for MySQL?  How well does it work
for you, any difficulties/gotchas or incomplete areas?  does the
mysqldrivercs driver work under mono?  I know, can try and see, just curious
if anyone has tried it at all...  Probably going to go with ByteFX.Data,
since that is what is supported by mono... however, as previously stated,
I like to work in windows as well.
