This is a historical artifact. The CVS modules are split up into native
and C# code rather than the logically distinct modules one would expect.

The current structure works, so the plan to fix it post-1.0. Things to
consider in a restructuring:

      * The native runtime/JIT is expected to mature sooner than the
        class libraries, so we don't want to have to tie their release
        schedules together. It's possible that just the core of the C#
        class libraries that make heavy use of icalls to the runtime
        could be shipped along with the C code, and the rest of the
        class libraries could have their own modules.
      * mcs relies on the native Jay tool to generate the parser so
        splitting mcs into its own module doesn't buy instant
        arch-independent modularity.
      * Users and packagers are only just getting used to the current
        layout. Restructure and we risk opening up to a new barrage of
        chicken-and-egg questions on mono-list.
      * Mono uses CVS, thus any changes in directory structure need the
        participation of a qualified CVS surgeon

That said, it is a valid topic for constructive discussion. Perhaps
there is a bug number for this in Bugzilla where discussion can
continue?
