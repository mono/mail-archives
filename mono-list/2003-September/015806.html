<PRE>I've only just picked up on this thread, so excuse me if some of this has 
already been said.

I agree with Davy. I don't want to learn GTK+ just to learn GTK#.

If you just want skeleton API documentation to get you started why not run the 
GTK# assemblies through ndoc. I'm not sure if ndoc will run on mono. The worst 
case is compiling the GTK# source and generating the XML doc files locally, 
then using ndoc to either produce .chm help file or MSDN style html api docs.

I'm a little surprised no-one has done this yet. This could be a useful 
contribution to the GTK# project. If there's no takers, I'll happily do it.

Does this sound useful?

Brian.

</I>&gt;<i> current level of the documentation.  And yea i've already received 
</I>&gt;<i> plenty of &quot;it's a developing project so do your part and write the

</I>&gt;<i> API reference (all the extra eplanation isn't even necessary... just a 
</I>&gt;<i> list of everything the class has to offer would be nice) which would 
</I>&gt;<i> be easily accessible (for instance in HTML form like that GTK+ API 
</I>&gt;<i> documentation that you mentioned).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All i'm saying is that if you want people to use mono and gtk#, then 
</I>&gt;<i> don't expect them to learn GTK+ first or to have GTK+ experience.  
</I>&gt;<i> People who don't know GTK+ but who want to learn GTK# won't like being 
</I>&gt;<i> told &quot;learn GTK+ first and then you'll be able to use GTK# well 
</I>&gt;<i> enough&quot;.  As i said before, it's like telling people to learn C before 
</I>&gt;<i> they can learn C# and we all know that's not necessary.
