<PRE>Matt,

It would be great for Novell to get involved in the development if your
management sees fit to do so.  I have been working in a library for about 6
weeks now, and as you read in my previous message, I am making good
progress.  I have very high interest in the library's development, as I do
Directory Services and EIM related work full time...we actually run
eDirectory and DirXML and are using the products extensively in production.

I guess one of my questions now is regarding ownership.  I would like to be
involved in the development even if a big player such as Novell jumps in.  I
know that since my work is still in its infancy and that I am one lone
contributor, that Novell's involvement may overshadow mine.  If that is the
case, I'd like to know as soon as possible so I can avoid spinning my
wheels.  Otherwise, I'll continue my work on a separate path.

Matt, please let me know what kind of timeline Novell is looking at for
potentially making a decision to contribute to the process, and if you guys
do decide to, please get me some information on how many developers will be
involved and how much time Novell plans to dedicate to the project in the
near future.

Best Regards,

Jason Raneses

All,

I work for Novell's Developer Services organization representing
developer relations between our Linux products and non-Novell engineers.
 I would like to see what can be done by Novell to be a better
participant here than what we have been so far.

If you are interested in a C# LDAP library or are currently working on
one, I would like to specifically know what your interest or involvement
is.  My intent would be to try to see if I can figure out how to
coordinate this with the efforts of the eDirectory development team so
we are more open-source friendly than we currently are.

</I>Miguel, all...

The C# LDAP library aims to provide, at a minimal level, the same
amount of
functionality found in the Mozilla (Netscape) Java LDAP classes.  I am
planning to support the synchronous portions in version 1, and the
asynchronous in a later release.  My initial thoughts were to write
everything in native C#, however, because of time constraints on a few
of
the projects I am working on that require this library, I chose to go
the
frequently traveled route of wrapping existing unmanaged C libraries,
and at
the same time, solidifying the API, so, at a later time, I can rewrite
each
portion in native C#, without breaking any interfaces.

My development team and I were not satisfied with Microsoft's
implementation
of the System.DirectoryServices namespace, and did not see the need to
purchase a 3rd party library, thus I began this project on the side
about a
month ago.  It can be used with pretty much any C dll based on the
University of Michigan reference code.

I'd say that the code is not too far off from being good enough to drop
in
CVS.  I have to work on some of the thread synchronization a bit more,
and
am still finishing up work on the ldap_modify wrappers.  The classes
and
collections that search and iterate directory data are for the most
part
already completed.

Jason

Hello,

&gt;<i> It would be ideal to develop a fully managed provider, but I had an
</I>&gt;<i> immediate need to get at least a subset of the API up and working,
</I>&gt;<i> and the easiest route to go was to wrap the C libraries.  My long
</I>&gt;<i> term goal is for the library to not have any unmanaged dependencies
</I>&gt;<i> whatsoever, and I plan on removing them over time by implementing
</I>the
&gt;<i> functionality provided by the C libraries in native C#.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would be stellar to have the guys from Novell involved in this if
</I>&gt;<i> they are interested.  Does anyone have anything concrete on their
</I>&gt;<i> time frame for making a decision to join the development?
</I>
Jason, can you tell us more about your current binding, and whether it
is mature enough to get it on CVS?

Miguel.
