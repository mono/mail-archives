Matt,

I might be able to point you in the right direction, since I just
recently got mod_mono working on my system, but your email has no
details about what trouble you're having.  I've already mentioned on
this list my problems/concerns with the INSTALL instructions, but I
managed (with people from this lists' help) to fumble through it.

To try to point you in the right direction without knowing what
problem(s) you're having, I will presume it's the same or similar issues
I was having...

1) You must run mono /path_to_xsp/mod-mono-server.exe BEFORE you
    start httpd.  You must run this in the path where the aspx 
    pages/scripts are located or you'll get an error on the current path
    (At least this was my experience - YMMV)
    This creates the socket /tmp/mod_mono_server which allows Apache
    to talk to the mono (mod_mono) server.  You'll need to change the
    permissions or ownership (more secure) of the file because it's
    owned by root vs. apache.  I created a script to do this that I
    can send if you can't find it on the list archive.  If you don't
    change the ownership, you'll get a &quot;permission denied&quot; error in
    your apache error_log.

2) You must use ONLY mono_unix_module in httpd.conf.  I was attempting
    to use both mod_mono and mono_unix_module (initially I had 
    mod_mono_unix which really fouled things up).  The following are
    the entries I have:
Listen 8080 
LoadModule mono_unix_module /$MONODIR/src/.libs/libmod_mono_unix.so
MonoApplicationUnix /mono /tmp/mod_mono_server
(For me $MONODIR is /usr/local/mod_mono-0.4, but substitute your REAL
directory)

3) I still haven't figured out why (been busy and it hasn't been a
priority) I have to have the aspx pages in two places.  It seems one
piece of mod_mono looks in the base directory where mono is started and
then one piece looks in the mono directory within it.

Hope this helps!
