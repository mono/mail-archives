<PRE>All,

I work for Novell's Developer Services organization representing
developer relations between our Linux products and non-Novell engineers.
 I would like to see what can be done by Novell to be a better
participant here than what we have been so far.

If you are interested in a C# LDAP library or are currently working on
one, I would like to specifically know what your interest or involvement
is.  My intent would be to try to see if I can figure out how to
coordinate this with the efforts of the eDirectory development team so
we are more open-source friendly than we currently are.

</I>Miguel, all...

The C# LDAP library aims to provide, at a minimal level, the same
amount of
functionality found in the Mozilla (Netscape) Java LDAP classes.  I am
planning to support the synchronous portions in version 1, and the
asynchronous in a later release.  My initial thoughts were to write
everything in native C#, however, because of time constraints on a few
of
the projects I am working on that require this library, I chose to go
the
frequently traveled route of wrapping existing unmanaged C libraries,
and at
the same time, solidifying the API, so, at a later time, I can rewrite
each
portion in native C#, without breaking any interfaces.

My development team and I were not satisfied with Microsoft's
implementation
of the System.DirectoryServices namespace, and did not see the need to
purchase a 3rd party library, thus I began this project on the side
about a
month ago.  It can be used with pretty much any C dll based on the
University of Michigan reference code.

I'd say that the code is not too far off from being good enough to drop
in
CVS.  I have to work on some of the thread synchronization a bit more,
and
am still finishing up work on the ldap_modify wrappers.  The classes
and
collections that search and iterate directory data are for the most
part
already completed.

Hello,

&gt;<i> It would be ideal to develop a fully managed provider, but I had an
</I>&gt;<i> immediate need to get at least a subset of the API up and working,
</I>&gt;<i> and the easiest route to go was to wrap the C libraries.  My long
</I>&gt;<i> term goal is for the library to not have any unmanaged dependencies
</I>&gt;<i> whatsoever, and I plan on removing them over time by implementing
</I>the
&gt;<i> functionality provided by the C libraries in native C#.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would be stellar to have the guys from Novell involved in this if
</I>&gt;<i> they are interested.  Does anyone have anything concrete on their
</I>&gt;<i> time frame for making a decision to join the development?
</I>
Jason, can you tell us more about your current binding, and whether it
is mature enough to get it on CVS?

Miguel.
