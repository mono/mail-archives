<PRE>My goal with the library is to be directory agnostic, as are the widely used
Netscape Java and C libraries (based on the University of Michigan code,
same base as is used in OpenLDAP).  If you look at what Microsoft has done
with their work in the DirectoryServices namespace, it's obvious there is a
lot of room for improvement...there is definitely not a lot of flexibility.
I think a much better job could have been done, but my guess is that they
ran out of time and decided just to wrap ADSI in the quickest manner
possible.

You can use Microsoft's classes to work with standard LDAP servers besides
AD, however, ADSI has some problems with other vendors servers (specifically
eDirectory from my experience).  There are ways to work around it, but it is
a hack, and it is nowhere near elegant.

I have about 10 classes written so far, and am close to starting work on the
asynchronous side of things in a few weeks.  I really think that Mono can do
a much better job than Microsoft has done on their LDAP library with not
much extra effort.

Subject: [Mono-list] Incompatibility between Microsoft's .NET and Mono

There are obviously some areas (e.g. Active Directory)
where Microsoft has chosen a proprietary path that Mono can
not fully duplicate. I am curious what the general strategy
is for Mono to work around areas where incompatibilities
can not be overcome?

Will Mono attempt to produce better components than the
ones Microsoft has or will we have to play second fiddle to
the corporate barons?

Has there been any attempt to fully identify which areas
are going to be problematic?


Forgive my ignorance.

Anthony
