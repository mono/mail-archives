<PRE>Don't be concerned about licensing issues. :-)

Mono uses three different types of licenses.

The class libraries are X11 licensed.  If you're writing a .NET
application, these are the libraries you'll be using, such as
mscorlib.dll and System.Xml.dll.  The X11 license allows you to do
nearly anything you want with the code -- including copying it and using
it in your own app -- and the only requirement is that you maintain the
copyright attributions within the files.  You don't even need to
advertise that you're using X11 code.

The runtime libraries, such as the JIT, are LGPL.  So if you're writing
a program that links against these, you can keep your own code private. 
However, you need to provide a way for users to link your app against
newer versions of the libraries.  The easiest way to do this is to
dynamically link against them (like DLLs in Windows), and then you don't
need to worry about it.  The downside is that this would require your
users to download and install mono separately.  If they're on Red Hat or
Suse, this is easiest for them, as they can just use Red Carpet.

If you *modify* the runtime libraries and distribute the changed
libraries, *then* you need to release the changes you made.

Applications, such as mono and mcs, use the GPL.  You probably won't
need to modify these, so it shouldn't affect you.
