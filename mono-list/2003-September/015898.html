<PRE>Rob,

Most of the .NET developers for Windows develop business
applications--both Web and WinForms. Most of us are not OS
or compiler developers and would probably be fairly useless
to the coding of the basic framework.

However, many of us are decent at writing components and
controls. There are probably many many developers who could
assist in this area.

Rather than simply focus on one area, why not recruit all
the talent available and use it where it is most
appropriate. 

The more components and tools available for Mono, the more
people will begin to work with it. The more likely you will
be find more people who are qualified to help code the
framework.

What I am trying to say is that this probably does not have
to be an either/or situation. You don't need to remove
framework developers to build components. Concurrent
related projects could be managed to both further develop
Mono as well as the additional components that run on Mono.

Just an idea.

Anthony
