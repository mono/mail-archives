<PRE>&quot;I would like to see what can be done by Novell to be a better
participant here than what we have been so far.&quot;

Matt,
  I have been a Novell fan for several years and I'm delighted to see
them get involved in the Open Source community.  By utilizing Netware,
ZenWorks, BorderManager, and Groupwise I was able to manage dozens of
servers and thousands of users with no problem, minus the 15hrs./day
troubleshooting and fixing windows problems:)  
  I believe that Novell is now going in the right direction and hope
that they don't make some of the same mistakes that Sun and others have
made when working with the Open Source community.  I made the move from
the Java camp to C#/Mono... because the project is building a better
product that is truly open source.  The fact that Novell bought Ximian
was another factor that encouraged me to become involved in this
project.  In my opinion Novell has a golden opportunity to help the Mono
project, the Open Source community in general, and themselves by
considering the following ideas:
   
  - Act as a partner with the Open Source community and not as a
dictator.   

  - Make real contributions to Open Source projects like Mono.  In many
cases contributions that only focus on corporate objectives do not win
the support of the Open Source community.   

  - Incorporate Open Source tools like Mono in Novells products and
services.  It would be great to see Mono as a component of NW7.

  - Give credit to the projects that Novell is involved in.  This gives
the project exposure, validity, and momentum.  

  -  Contribute resources for documentation, tutorials, and support and
not just code.   

  -  Encourage the many quality Engineers, Tech Writers, and others at
Novell to become involved in Open Source projects like Mono.  There is
strength and momentum in numbers.  Even small contributions like bug
reports are very helpful.

  -  Direct people to the projects that Novell is involved in.  I saw a
Ximian product link from the Novell website, but didn't see a link to
Mono.

#------------------------------------------------------------------#

&quot;If you are interested in a C# LDAP library or are currently working on
one, I would like to specifically know what your interest or involvement
is.&quot;

-  Having a good LDAP implementation for Mono will allow me to further
the development of Open Source projects that I'm working on.  I would
like to use Mono/C# and OpenLDAP for user authentication.


These comments are just my 2 cents and are not an official position of
this project or anyone but me.

Thanks!

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The C# LDAP library aims to provide, at a minimal level, the same
</I>&gt;<i> amount of
</I>&gt;<i> functionality found in the Mozilla (Netscape) Java LDAP classes.  I am
</I>&gt;<i> planning to support the synchronous portions in version 1, and the
</I>&gt;<i> asynchronous in a later release.  My initial thoughts were to write
</I>&gt;<i> everything in native C#, however, because of time constraints on a few
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> the projects I am working on that require this library, I chose to go
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> frequently traveled route of wrapping existing unmanaged C libraries,
</I>&gt;<i> and at
</I>&gt;<i> the same time, solidifying the API, so, at a later time, I can rewrite
</I>&gt;<i> each
</I>&gt;<i> portion in native C#, without breaking any interfaces.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My development team and I were not satisfied with Microsoft's
</I>&gt;<i> implementation
</I>&gt;<i> of the System.DirectoryServices namespace, and did not see the need to
</I>&gt;<i> purchase a 3rd party library, thus I began this project on the side
</I>&gt;<i> about a
</I>&gt;<i> month ago.  It can be used with pretty much any C dll based on the
</I>&gt;<i> University of Michigan reference code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd say that the code is not too far off from being good enough to drop
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> CVS.  I have to work on some of the thread synchronization a bit more,
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> am still finishing up work on the ldap_modify wrappers.  The classes
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> collections that search and iterate directory data are for the most
</I>&gt;<i> part
</I>&gt;<i> already completed.

</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It would be ideal to develop a fully managed provider, but I had an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; immediate need to get at least a subset of the API up and working,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and the easiest route to go was to wrap the C libraries.  My long
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; term goal is for the library to not have any unmanaged dependencies
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whatsoever, and I plan on removing them over time by implementing
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; functionality provided by the C libraries in native C#.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It would be stellar to have the guys from Novell involved in this if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they are interested.  Does anyone have anything concrete on their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time frame for making a decision to join the development?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Jason, can you tell us more about your current binding, and whether it
</I>&gt;<i> is mature enough to get it on CVS?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Miguel.
