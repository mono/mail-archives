<PRE>Please pardon my ignorance.

I presently develop applications in C# under the Microsoft
.NET platform. I am very interested in moving my
development to Linux and Mono and leaving the Microsoft
world behind. 

However, I am concerned about software licensing issues. As
I make my living developing software, I am dependent on the
SALE of the software to feed my family. I don't want to get
in a situation where I am required to either give away my
software or bundle the source with the application.

Can someone tell me what the requirements/rules are for
selling software components/applications developed under
Linux and/or Mono.

Remember, this is not about a big company trying to get
bigger. This is a little guy wanting to continue eating.

Thanks for your help!

Anthony
