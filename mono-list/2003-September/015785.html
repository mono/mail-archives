<PRE>Thanks for your help.  I was primarily trying to find the authoritative
source for the documentation, so I didn't include a lot of details about
my problem.

Nevertheless, your information and that of others who replied as well
was crucial.  I've got it up and running now.  Thanks for your
assistance.

Matt,

I might be able to point you in the right direction, since I just
recently got mod_mono working on my system, but your email has no
details about what trouble you're having.  I've already mentioned on
this list my problems/concerns with the INSTALL instructions, but I
managed (with people from this lists' help) to fumble through it.

To try to point you in the right direction without knowing what
problem(s) you're having, I will presume it's the same or similar
issues
I was having...

1) You must run mono /path_to_xsp/mod-mono-server.exe BEFORE you
    start httpd.  You must run this in the path where the aspx 
    pages/scripts are located or you'll get an error on the current
path
    (At least this was my experience - YMMV)
    This creates the socket /tmp/mod_mono_server which allows Apache
    to talk to the mono (mod_mono) server.  You'll need to change the
    permissions or ownership (more secure) of the file because it's
    owned by root vs. apache.  I created a script to do this that I
    can send if you can't find it on the list archive.  If you don't
    change the ownership, you'll get a &quot;permission denied&quot; error in
    your apache error_log.

2) You must use ONLY mono_unix_module in httpd.conf.  I was attempting
    to use both mod_mono and mono_unix_module (initially I had 
    mod_mono_unix which really fouled things up).  The following are
    the entries I have:
Listen 8080 
LoadModule mono_unix_module /$MONODIR/src/.libs/libmod_mono_unix.so
MonoApplicationUnix /mono /tmp/mod_mono_server
(For me $MONODIR is /usr/local/mod_mono-0.4, but substitute your REAL
directory)

3) I still haven't figured out why (been busy and it hasn't been a
priority) I have to have the aspx pages in two places.  It seems one
piece of mod_mono looks in the base directory where mono is started
and
then one piece looks in the mono directory within it.

Hope this helps!
