Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

&gt;<i> exposes UI for picking files on the client and showing log/status

Yes.

Maybe.  Mono supports P/Invoke to libraries with &quot;C&quot; exports, not C++,
not COM, not anything else.  Just &quot;C&quot; exports.

Furthermore, the &quot;native 3rd party DLL&quot; is probably only available on
Windows.  You can't use a native DLL cross-platform -- it can't be used
on Linux (different file formats) or Mac OS X (different processor).

The portability of your app will be dependent upon how portable this DLL
is, or how easily you can avoid the DLL.
 
&gt;<i> Today, i'm looking at using .NET 2.0/C#/WinForms for this on Windows,
</I>&gt;<i> but i want to make it cross-platform for Linux and Mac OS X.
</I>
Mono's support for .NET 2.0 APIs is in-flux (though we can always use
the extra test cases. :-)

WinForms is currently incomplete, but is scheduled for completion around
September, to be released with Mono 1.2.  There will likely still be
some limitations, though, such as restrictions from P/Invoking into
KERNEL32.DLL, USER32.DLL, and other non-portable libraries.  (There may
be a way around this, but I haven't heard of it.)
 
&gt;<i> Can anyone please confirm the state of Mono today w.r.t. these
</I>&gt;<i> features?   Should it be doable to have a (rather simple) networked
</I>&gt;<i> client, using async socket i/o, and doing interop, and have the same
</I>&gt;<i> code base work x-platform?   Also, I'm not wedded to WinForms, and
</I>&gt;<i> would be fine with something else (Gtk#) if it's similar and easy to
</I>&gt;<i> use.
</I>
If you can live with the above restrictions, this should be possible.

You might also look into Cocoa# for the Mac OS X UI.
 
&gt;<i> Should I be using Mono 1.1.8 to start with?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> What's the easiest development approach (given that we're a Windows
</I>&gt;<i> dev house today)?   Dev on Windows, test on Mac/Linux?   Dev on Linux
</I>&gt;<i> or Mac?
</I>
Dev on Windows under Mono, test on Mac/Linux.  Mono/Windows tends to get
less testing than Mono/Linux, so if it runs on Mono/Windows, it's more
likely to run under Linux. :-)
