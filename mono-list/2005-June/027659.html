<PRE>Visual Studio is by far the best IDE for .NET available (especially if you know someone with an MSDE Subscription and get it fer free ;-) ).  There is at least one open source .NET IDE I ran across on Sourceforge.  With VS.NET you will have to code on Windoze workstations and have to use SourceSafe as version control, but the assemblies are more portable to Linux servers than an equivalent scenario in Java.

Nevertheless, your comment about &quot;new and shiny&quot; begs the question.  PHP 5.x with Zend Studio 4.0 and Subversion on Linux is a GREAT development environment and is as object-oriented as the developer wants it to be (like C++, you can continue to write procedural code).

IMHO, C# is, in its 2.0 version, more functional than Java 5.0 (though the two keep leap-frogging each other).  However, C# is an OPEN STANDARD and Java is NOT.  Given a choice, I'll always go for open standards.

Finally, have you considered Python and ActiveState's Komodo IDE?  Great combination, especially for Linux!

Subject: [Mono-list] IDEs, Visual Studio and Mono


Hullo :)

Having built up a mess of PHP code over five years, we're now looking at 
making a clean break to something new and shiny. We're a PHP/Linux shop for all server activity so would like to use Mono+Apache.

The problem I'm having is finding definitive info on IDEs given that we'll be 
using the Web forms functionality exclusively.

Management would like us to use Visual Studio. VS confuses me greatly. The 'Standard'  C# edition is about &#163;90 whilst the Developer edition is &#163;1500. 

I guess I'm just looking for some sage advice on how a 5-developer operation 
with source control might work re: a Mono backend.. are there any things I need to bear in mind e.g. with a dev working on code and ASP.NET execution on 
localhost, and then submitting to CVS / SVN ? If it works on their local 
machine, should it work with Mono?

What about database connections (we're using MySQL of course..) - is the C# code likely to be identical whether run on MS's .NET SDK or Mono?

Does VS even let you use CVS / SVN as opposed to Visual SourceSafe?

Sorry if this is mostly off-topic - am just looking for a little reassurance 
since this is all very new to me.

Cheers,
Gavin.
