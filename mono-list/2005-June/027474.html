<PRE>Hi all,

There's somthing I don't understand (well in fact there is a lot of
things I don't understand in life, but let's focus on this one :-)  :

I've got a little test page running on Mono XSP.
When something is changed in the bin folder, the client sessions are
destroyed and I don't know how to avoid that (except using sessions
linked to a database but I don't want to do that). Explanation below :

Here's the aspx test page I used :

&lt;%@ Page language=&quot;C#&quot; Debug=&quot;true&quot;%&gt;
&lt;%
if (HttpContext.Current.Session[&quot;testing&quot;] == null) {
	Response.Write(&quot;Session variable is NULL&lt;br/&gt;Setting session variable to 1&quot;);
	HttpContext.Current.Session[&quot;testing&quot;] = 1;
} else {
	Response.Write(&quot;Session variable is &quot; +
HttpContext.Current.Session[&quot;testing&quot;]);
}
%&gt;

First time the client request the page, the message : &quot;&quot;&quot;Session
variable is NULL
Setting session variable to 1&quot;&quot;&quot; is displayed, then, as soon as the
session will be alive, the message should be &quot;&quot;&quot;Session variable is
1&quot;&quot;&quot;

It's working ok. But when a file is copied, changed or deleted from
the bin folder, the session is loosed.

I know that the bin folder is tracked so the web server knows if it
should recompile pages that uses dll inside, but I don't understand
why session is loosed. Is there a way to avoid this ?

PS: I also tried under .NET and IIS and the behaviour was the same. So
I guess it is and intended behaviour but I want to avoid this.
