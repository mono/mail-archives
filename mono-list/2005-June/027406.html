<PRE>&gt;<i> Now I think you can see that neither of these technologies are depending on

Neither of these technologies depend on CAS, but, if I understand
correctly they were created in the first place for reasons to do with
CAS - in fact, to get round security limitations that CAS imposes.

Surely there is not much merit in having this technology until CAS
support is fully mature as it is designed to be a helper to run the
app with full trust?

</I>&gt;<i> Internet Exploer interacts with .NET Framework because it has to tell the

</I>&gt;<i> cache (Temporary Internet Files) but the runtime knows the actual CodeBase

</I>&gt;<i> according to your configuration files that can be changed if you want to
</I>&gt;<i> grant full trust to all of the code that you are executing from other
</I>&gt;<i> machines.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And because the runtime knows the CodeBase of the assembly it can download
</I>&gt;<i> all of it's dependent assemblies as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So this is a feature of runtime in fact but integrates with Internet
</I>&gt;<i> Explorer. And there will be no question whether you want to execute the code
</I>&gt;<i> because it is safe to execute as it has no full trust. I think this is good.
</I>&gt;<i> Of course this causes exceptions when the code requires full trust. In this
</I>&gt;<i> case you have the ability to right click the file and save it to your hard
</I>&gt;<i> drive. Windows XP SP2 the will as you for permission to execute it because
</I>&gt;<i> it comes from an other computer (you can disable this warning) and will
</I>&gt;<i> execute it using full trust (if you did not change the default security
</I>&gt;<i> policy of .NET). But you have to download all of it's dependencies because
</I>&gt;<i> CodeBase will be your hard drive in this case.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Click Once is a feature of .NET Framework 2.0 that is a built-in installer
</I>&gt;<i> and lets you to download the application to your computer.
