I know of no equivalent to System.Web.* for SOAP services.

I also wouldn't worry about it, at least for SOAP services, as SOAP is a
W3C recommendation, and W3C doesn't accept recommendations that have
RAND patent licenses (or any other patent license except &quot;free for all
implementations of the recommendation&quot;, though Microsoft &amp; co. have
tried to change the W3C requirements...).

Anything NOT part of SOAP or covered by a W3C recommendation may be
suspect, though, such as the object &lt;=&gt; XML mapping patent that Dan
Maltes mentioned.

As for the worst that can happen...  You couldn't be able to use
System.Web.* anymore, and would have to listen to port 80 directly, grab
the XML, throw it into System.Xml.* (part of ECMA), and parse it
manually.  This would be annoying, but not terribly difficult, and this
would be an unlikely requirement (again, because SOAP/XSD/etc. are W3C
recommendations).

(Now, playing devils advocate, if Microsoft could get a patent on an
API, then System.Web.* could be covered, and a different API would need
to be written.  However, considering that people have tried
copyrighting/patenting GUI menu systems and the USSC didn't buy the
argument, I don't think this will actually be an issue.  Compatibility
is too strong a reason to discount...)
