Yes, I saw the #devel package but it's focus is on Windows.Forms apps, with 
very patchy support for Web.Forms - I'm looking for something a little 
tighter :)

</I>
OK that's workable I guess. It's possible then to extract code from SourceSafe 
from a Linux client? i.e. so that we can have 'releases' of our software to 
live servers?

&gt;<i> but the assemblies are more portable to Linux servers than

There is a strong feeling amongst our devels to try something new for a 
variety of reasons, one of which is enhancing their own skillset - the career 
options for a long-time PHP programmer aren't great.

My own feelings are that if we continue to use PHP, then old habits will 
continue to slip in. I would rather use something which mandates the use of 
objects and structure.

&gt;<i> IMHO, C# is, in its 2.0 version, more functional than Java 5.0 (though the
</I>&gt;<i> two keep leap-frogging each other).  
</I>
How is Mono coming along with 2.0 support? Usable or still rather patchy at 
present? I guess (hope) we can expect a final 2.0 release a couple of months 
after MS's own beta programme ends...

&gt;<i> However, C# is an OPEN STANDARD and 
</I>&gt;<i> Java is NOT.  Given a choice, I'll always go for open standards.
</I>
&lt;nod&gt; I would always kick against any talk here of servlets or JSP...

&gt;<i> Finally, have you considered Python and ActiveState's Komodo IDE?  Great
</I>&gt;<i> combination, especially for Linux!
</I>
Python gets glowing reports from everyone I've spoken to, but C# and .NET 
seems to be the way we're headed - again due mainly to how C# experience 
would be rated on a CV...

Cheers,
Gavin.
