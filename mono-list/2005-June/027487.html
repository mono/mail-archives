<PRE>Anybody have a good &quot;how to&quot; on installing Mono/XSP/mod_mono on a clean
install of Fedora Core 4?  Does it come packaged in FC4?  I have never used
Mono out side of the Windows environment and I am pretty new to Linux.  A
large client of my companies is looking to migrate to Mono from there old
server side include infrastructure.  So any help would be much appreciated.
I will announce the company after the project is completed, but this is a
huge up and coming company in a big market right now.  I can't really say
much but they are number 2 in their market as of their most recent buy outs.


 

Please send anything that you think may help.  Also I did go though the
Mod_Mono wiki post on mono-project.com and that didn't really help me in
getting the files actually installed and Mono up and running.  If possible I
would like a quick start to finish guide.

 

Thanks,

Nick
