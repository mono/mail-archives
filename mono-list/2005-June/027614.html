<PRE>I used Jonel Rienton's CSW build to get the base mono packages working and
I was able to compile command line c# programs. I have been trying to get
the http server (can't remember the name at the moment) working, but I was
unable to get it to compile. I did not try the apache plugin. If you are
successful with getting asp.net to work on Solaris 10 x86 please let me
know. I have an insider at the SUN headquarters trying to get me some
assistance on this as well. If I am able to get some good info I will
definitely pass it on.
