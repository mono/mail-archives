<PRE>Great - thanks.

&gt;&gt;<i> The portability of your app will be dependent upon how portable this DLL

This 3rd party developer has native DLLs/libraries available for Windows,
Mac OS X and Linux, and they do have &quot;C&quot; exports, so it sounds like we're
good to go there.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

Maybe.  Mono supports P/Invoke to libraries with &quot;C&quot; exports, not C++, not
COM, not anything else.  Just &quot;C&quot; exports.

Furthermore, the &quot;native 3rd party DLL&quot; is probably only available on
Windows.  You can't use a native DLL cross-platform -- it can't be used on
Linux (different file formats) or Mac OS X (different processor).

The portability of your app will be dependent upon how portable this DLL is,
or how easily you can avoid the DLL.

</I>
Mono's support for .NET 2.0 APIs is in-flux (though we can always use the
extra test cases. :-)

WinForms is currently incomplete, but is scheduled for completion around
September, to be released with Mono 1.2.  There will likely still be some
limitations, though, such as restrictions from P/Invoking into KERNEL32.DLL,
USER32.DLL, and other non-portable libraries.  (There may be a way around
this, but I haven't heard of it.)
 
&gt;<i> Can anyone please confirm the state of Mono today w.r.t. these
</I>&gt;<i> features?   Should it be doable to have a (rather simple) networked
</I>&gt;<i> client, using async socket i/o, and doing interop, and have the same

</I>&gt;<i> use.
</I>
If you can live with the above restrictions, this should be possible.

You might also look into Cocoa# for the Mac OS X UI.
 
&gt;<i> Should I be using Mono 1.1.8 to start with?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> What's the easiest development approach (given that we're a Windows
</I>&gt;<i> dev house today)?   Dev on Windows, test on Mac/Linux?   Dev on Linux
</I>&gt;<i> or Mac?
</I>
Dev on Windows under Mono, test on Mac/Linux.  Mono/Windows tends to get
less testing than Mono/Linux, so if it runs on Mono/Windows, it's more
likely to run under Linux. :-)
