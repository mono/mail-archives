	Dear Ian:

	Many, many thanks for your help.

&gt;<i> I've downloaded testy and tried to run it on windows, it immediately crashes
</I>&gt;<i> out and I get the option to load it in the vs2010 debugger.
</I>
	I don't have VS installed, just Monodevelop.

&gt;<i> The exception is:
</I>&gt;<i> Could not load file or assembly 'Mono.Posix, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral,
</I>&gt;<i> PublicKeyToken=0738eb9f132ed756' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot
</I>&gt;<i> find the file specified.
</I>&gt;<i> So your program depends on an assembly you've not shipped and that isn't part
</I>&gt;<i> of .Net.
</I>
	But I haven't added any special dll, nor MonoDevelop has warned me about needing to distribute anything special.

	I have manually removed that dependency from my project, but then, in the generated files for the user interface, I get the following error:

	/home/baltasarq/Documents/Dropbox/prys/Testy/Testy/gtk-gui/Testy.Gui.MainWindow.cs(94,94): Error CS0234: The type or namespace name `Unix' does not exist in the namespace `Mono'. Are you missing an assembly reference? (CS0234) (Testy)

	In the lines that deal with the stock icons, and so on, for actions:

		this.saveAction = new global::Gtk.Action (&quot;saveAction&quot;, global::Mono.Unix.Catalog.GetString (&quot;_Save&quot;), null, &quot;gtk-save&quot;);

	This is automatically generated by MonoDevelop, and I don't think I have...

	Wait a minute: now I understand.

	In all new projects, MonoDevelop checks the option to support Gettext, through the Mono.Unix class. You have to uncheck that option, and THEN delete &quot;Mono.Posix&quot; from the references list (be careful, MonoDevelop will add it automatically if you do in different order).

	Then the project builds without a glitch. I suppose that the absence of this reference will solve the problem.

&gt;<i> Mono.Posix does compile for windows, It just won't do everything it does on
</I>&gt;<i> posix platforms.
</I>
	It actually don't really seem to be needed at all, at least for multiplatform desktop -tiny- applications.

&gt;<i> Are the sources for testy public?
</I>
	Well, I don't care about giving away the sources, just nobody asked (expressed any interest) before. I've made them public in its web page. I've also updated the binaries.

	I suspect anyway that the problem has been solved. I'm longing to go back home in the afternoon and check it on Windows.

	Thank you very, very much.
