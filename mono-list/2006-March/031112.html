<PRE>Sounds like a case for Web Services to me.  I don't think I'd want to
expose remote objects other than Web services to possibly unknown third
parties.

 

Just my 2c ('dwy geiniog')

Subject: [Mono-list] Using Mono on Project for Work

 

Hey all, I've proposed the use of Mono for a project we're undertaking
at work and i've being asked to write up a small presentation on it. 

Ok i know more or less what Mono is, i also know that it does't support
&quot;software as a service&quot;. 

What we're trying to do is the following. 

We're going to have a machine running our own software (Java at the
moment). This can provide basic services like personalsation etc etc. 

What we want to do is to make it possible for Third Party developers to
write their own software that will be able to take advantage of our
software either remotely or downloaded and ran locally. 

At the moment our software is running on sun JVM but we could change
that to Mono. 

Can someone give me feedback on this and if it has being done to any
extent anywhere else. 

Thanks very much.
