Let's assume I'm not new to this.  What can be done to get Mono to
cohabitate with other packages with different versions of dependent
packages?

Thanks for the suggestion.  I'm using CentOS 4.2 which is based on RHES.
I've never used Red Carpet but if it gets around this issue I may try it.
With RPM, Yum, up2date, and apt available, doesn't it seem like overkill to
add yet another package manager to a system?  I see there is a potential
issue with Mono and Red Carpet anyway:

The distributions.xml file was never updated for this distro, though I can
understand the stock file can't be updated for every distro/release.

It was also suggested that I just use the Linux Installer:

In the long term I'd really like to understand and address the problem
rather than working around it.  But to start working with Mono now, sure,
I'll use the installer for both Linux and Win32.  This will also help for
quick deployment of anything I write.

Thanks again.
Tony
