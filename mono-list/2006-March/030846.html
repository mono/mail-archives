<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> I know that CSC creates a temp directory in where ever %TEMP% is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pointed to, to create the object files and deletes them when its all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> done building but the compiler inlined in Visual Studio creates a local
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> directory to store the object files (the lovely 'obj' dir you find
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lerking around).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I doubt very much that CSC generates anything resembling an &quot;object
</I>&gt;<i> file&quot;.   You are confused.
</I>
&quot;Object file&quot; was the wrong term to use. I was thinking of 
incrimentally compiling some IL backends and storing it off in some 
files somewhere so it could be brought back together in the end. 
However, I've gone back and observed it and examined the files a bit 
more closely, and it looks more like its just garbage for the debuggers 
and designers more then anything. I did catch thoigh what I'm pretty 
sure is just the PE header of the assembly it was generating before it 
deleted it but a few bits are missing. Oh well.. not really all that 
exciting or important.

&gt;&gt;<i> Not sure how credible this is but it says on the DotGNU wiki about how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their compiler works compared to ours: &quot;..CSCC is a 3 step compile,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> assemble and link compiler, while MCS is a direct codegeneration in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> memory with Reflection.Emit.&quot; They might be doing something completely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different system then anyone else out there
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They generate a text file with the il assembly, which later they pass on
</I>&gt;<i> to an IL assembler to assemble.  Thats all there is to it.
</I>
oh really?.. uhh.. wow... hmm... that's kind of interesting, but I 
think I'm going to just leave that one alone then...

Thanks everybody...
