<PRE>While I also prefer a *nix environment (FreeBSD), I think it's a bit myopic
to say that Server 2003 isn't production ready. To me the test of an OS is
always &quot;how well will it do what I want it to do&quot;, and there are times when
a .NET 2.0 solution on a MS platform will produce acceptable results the
fastest. SQL2005 Reporting Services and CLR integration are good examples of
technologies that really are superior on a MS platform.

The best platform for your needs is the one you know how to use the best.
Any good sysadmin will tell you that. The reason that I'm a fan of mono is
because I do think that MS and *nix both have their places. Mono makes it
easy to leverage the benefits of these platforms.

As I said before, I'm looking forward to watching mono mature. I very much
so want to use it in a production environment because I think that there are
many advantages to using *nix for many tasks. Currently I would have little
problem using the 1.1 features of mono for production. However, I am
somewhat addicted to things like generics, which as I understand it are not
quite where they need to be yet.

There are times when Mono/Linux will smoke VS.NET/MS, and there are times
when the reverse it true. I try to come up with a solution that makes sense
to my client. These days the most expensive things in computing are people,
and as such I try to come up with the solution that minimizes the amount of
cost that has to be sunk into development time, employee training, etc.

Good development practice involves more than just computers.

Everyone has their opinions ..

I use mono in a production environment, for a med sized pizza franchise in
Canada,
and hopefully soon rolling out a system using mono for one of the largest
pizza companies in the
world.

I find mono rock solid.
Regardless of how solid .Net 2.0 is your still running it on a OS i.e.
windows 2003 server, etc,
that is a alpha/beta version of an OS at best ..
so whats better a &quot;VS.Net 2005 considered superior to mono&quot; as you say (but
i dont agree)
on a alpha/beta OS,
or Mono on a bullit proof OS i.e. Linux

end result is mono on linux is going to smoke MS .Net on a MS OS each and
every time.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've been evaluating Mono/C# for a few weeks now and am generally 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; impressed by what I see.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My group works currently in the C/Linux world where we develop near 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; real-time scientific application software.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm looking at C#/Mono because:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a) Another group at our company uses C# / Windows and they rave about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; b) I'd like to bring get my group using something more modern then C.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; c) It would be nice if the two groups use the same development 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; language to encourage code reuse.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have two questions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The first is what are there any things I need to worry about that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be difficult to do in the Mono/C# world that are fairly easy 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and standard in the C world?  Note we have a distributed environment
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  where most of the programs are fairly small.  The programs typically
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  perform a specific function (e.g. ingest the data, or run an 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; algorithm on it) and then pass it on to the next program.  Data is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; passed in a number of ways, but mainly through file sharing and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pipes.  We often use shell scripts to control the flow of data and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the programs to do the actual work.  In addition, we have fair number
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  of existing C functions that I wish not to duplicate (at least not 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; initially) but I believe I can incorporate them using SWIG.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> .Net and therefore Mono is a complete platform/framework whereas
</I>&gt;<i> it sounds like you use the more traditional C/Unix environment of C as 
</I>&gt;<i> the language, and Unix as the platform.  There's no reason you can't use 
</I>&gt;<i> the same development methodology with Mono (small apps, shell ties them 
</I>&gt;<i> together), but I think you'll be disappointed with the performance.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO Mono will work much better if you work toward adopting it not just 
</I>&gt;<i> as a language, but as a framework.  Use remoting instead of sockets and 
</I>&gt;<i> pipes.  Write larger applications, so you don't have to tie them 
</I>&gt;<i> together with shell scripts.  And definitely encourage good OO 
</I>&gt;<i> programming techniques so that your entire organization can reuse code 
</I>&gt;<i> and build a common internal framework.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is just my $0.02.  I'm not saying Mono won't work as a drop-in 
</I>&gt;<i> replacement for small C apps.  I'm just saying thats not where its 
</I>&gt;<i> strengths lie.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Secondly, I'm slightly concerned that at some point down the road 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (say 3 - 5 years) Mono, for whatever reason, will no longer be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; supported.  From what I've seen so far, Mono is a solid project with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  a strong following of core programmers supporting it and I see no 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reason why it might fade away.  But I don't have a good feel for how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  many people are using it and if that number is growing from year to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  year or if it has started to stagnate, i.e. has Mono hit critical 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mass?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This seems to be a pretty common fear, but I think you can be at ease
</I>&gt;<i> about the longevity of Mono.  First of all subscribing to the mono-devel
</I>&gt;<i> list will give you a good idea of how quickly mono is progressing.  Also
</I>&gt;<i> Mono has a major corporate backer, Novell.  While Novell has seen better
</I>&gt;<i> days, they're not going away anytime soon, and they've completely
</I>&gt;<i> committed to Linux and Mono as their platform.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the most part, the free and open source software world has accepted
</I>&gt;<i> Mono after some trepidation.  Popular databases distribute Mono specific
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces, and many popular Java projects have been ported (such as
</I>&gt;<i> (N)Hibernate or iText#).  RedHat's Fedora distribution even includes
</I>&gt;<i> Mono now, even though RedHat remains very committed to Java in the
</I>&gt;<i> enterprise (vs. Mono/.Net).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, the ECMA specifications themselves seem to be constantly
</I>&gt;<i> improving. There were lots of exciting language and framework improves 
</I>&gt;<i> in .Net 2.0, and lots of interesting work being done for 3.0.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The main area I see Mono acceptance as being slow is ISVs, and thats
</I>&gt;<i> because they're probably using Microsoft .Net, C++, or Java as their
</I>&gt;<i> development environment.  I think as Linux continues to gain market
</I>&gt;<i> share and the support of ISVs, you'll see more ISVs choosing .Net &amp; Mono
</I>&gt;<i> as their cross platform development framework.  However, thats largely
</I>&gt;<i> speculation, and there's a pretty good argument for Java
</I>&gt;<i> staying/becoming dominant in the cross platform space.
