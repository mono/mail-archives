The first was many months ago and I got stuck in a web of dependencies. I'm trying again with v1.1.13 and just got stuck with similar issues. I'm not a Linux/RPM stud here, so please forgive me if there is an easy answer to what seems like dependency hell:

</I>I don't know what anyone else will say, but from where I sit if you're 
new to the Linux/RPM stuff you should use something like Red Carpet that 
will sort all that stuff out for you.

I guess the first thing you would have to do would be to reverse 
anything you've done.  Then you'd have to get Red Carpet or whatever, 
set it up and go from there.

The actual tool to use would depend on your distribution, I guess.  I 
use SuSE and Red Carpet works fine for me, but I don't know about other 
distributions.
