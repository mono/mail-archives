<PRE>Hi all,

I'm trying to write my first GTK# application, and I want to really
understand Gtk# as I do java.  I like to write all the GUI code by
hand rather than using the interface designer to build it for me.

So, I have a window, menu bar, and am starting to get used to the
other widgets.  I'm using monodoc to help me along here, but it has,
well, very little info in some areas.  I'll submit monodoc text for
what I find out if someone can show me simple sample code that can
guide me in the code starting with the following:

1- Can someone show me some sample code of adding custom (non-stock)
toolbar buttons with an icon?  What format is the icon?  Where does it
need to exist?
2- I notice in monodoc that there is only an &quot;insert&quot; method to deal
with stock toolbar buttons, and not an append or prepend.  Why is
this?
3- What is &quot;private tooltip&quot; use for in toolbar widgets?  How is it
different from the tooltip parameter?
4- I notice that the statusbar widget only allows simple text.  Is
there an equivalent of complex status bars with multiple panels?  Or
do I need to create a custom widget for that?
5- I need to make some &quot;pretty&quot; tab controls.  Is there documentation
somewhere on making user controls from the ground up?  i.e.: the
equivalent of a usercontrol in winforms where the usercontrol does its
own custom painting?

If you've been noticing (or bothered by ;-)  ) my trivial questions in
getting mono setup and running, you'll notice that I'm on to actually
using it now.  And I intend to take this program that was being
designed and written for winforms and make in mono/gtk# instead of
winforms.  It will just take some time as I convert my thinking to the
mono and gtk# way of doing things, so I thank you for your patience.

Thanks,

Kevin
