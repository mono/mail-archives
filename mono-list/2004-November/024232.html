<PRE>&gt;<i> Mhm, then I misunderstood. You just missed your whole patch for
</I>&gt;<i> what you really need (in fact that is what I was afraid of).
</I>
   No. I did not want to touch driver.cs because of the reason that
&quot;/doc&quot; would be provided for the standard XML-doc style as in MS .Net
framework.

   However, the Documentation part would be standard. The only
extension that I need is that I want raw string and not XMLElement.

   As such, my patch &quot;is&quot; complete in itself. To get XMLElement for
&quot;/doc&quot;, just call &quot;CreateComment&quot; on the document collected.

&gt;<i> Please provide all what you should put to require mcs hackers
</I>
   Already said - I need raw comments, with &quot;///&quot; and &quot;/**&quot; included.

&gt;<i> If you are going to create another tool, then you should keep
</I>&gt;<i> your changes on those mcs sources in your local mcs copy, so that
</I>
   The reason is &quot;/doc&quot; is a standard switch thought about being
provided in mcs as well. My patch provides basic infrastructure to it.
Only that it does not generate and XML-file or validate or create any
XML-nodes.

&gt;<i> other mcs hackers don't have to be bothered about whatever they
</I>&gt;<i> never use.
</I>
   The patch definitely has a use -- as said above.


Cheers,
Gaurav Vaish
