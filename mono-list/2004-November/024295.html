</I>
They are empty because there is no suitable, portable, equivalent.

I'll go through each in turn from the Gnome perspective, but KDE will
likely have different reasons/rationale, and I'm not familiar with KDE.

&gt;<i> My results:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>               Desktop ==&gt; /home/kewhite/Desktop
</I>&gt;<i>              Programs ==&gt;
</I>
What should Programs be?  This is normally C:\Program Files, under which
is a directory per program/suite.  On Unix, programs aren't normally
organized in this fashion, so this doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, the directories /bin, /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin, /opt/bin,
/opt/local/bin/, ~/bin (etc.), would work.  However, only a single
string can be returned from Environment.GetFolderPath().

&gt;<i>              Personal ==&gt; /home/kewhite
</I>&gt;<i>             Favorites ==&gt;
</I>
Favorites isn't a directory, it's a file, and it varies between browsers
(for example, Epiphany uses ~/.gnome2/epiphany/bookmarks.rdf).

&gt;<i>               Startup ==&gt;
</I>
Startup isn't a directory; it's a combination of shell scrips
(/etc/profile, ~/.bashrc, ~/.xinitrc, etc.), and it's non-trivial to
determine which scripts apply (since it depends on the shell the user
uses, and e.g. ~/.bashrc may explicitly include another file, ad
nauseum).

&gt;<i>                Recent ==&gt;
</I>
Recent isn't a directory.  It's either a file or a location in GConf,
I'm not sure which.

&gt;<i>                SendTo ==&gt;
</I>
Has no Linux equivalent that I'm aware of, though
~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts might work.

&gt;<i>             StartMenu ==&gt;
</I>
The Gnome menu layout is based on applying rules to .desktop files found
in various directories.  It's not a single directory.

&gt;<i>               MyMusic ==&gt;
</I>
A directory for storing music hasn't been agreed upon at
freedesktop.org.  This may happen in the future, though arguably the
user's home directory should be returned for now.

&gt;<i>      DesktopDirectory ==&gt; /home/kewhite/Desktop
</I>&gt;<i>            MyComputer ==&gt;
</I>
For awhile, Gnome didn't have a My Computer equivalent.  Now it does,
and it's a virtual directory.

&gt;<i>             Templates ==&gt;
</I>
This was added to Nautilus 2.4, IIRC, and it's ~/Templates.  This may
change, though.

&gt;<i>       ApplicationData ==&gt; /home/kewhite/.config
</I>&gt;<i>  LocalApplicationData ==&gt; /home/kewhite/.local/share
</I>&gt;<i>         InternetCache ==&gt;
</I>
This is dependent upon the browser, and for Gecko-based browsers, this
will have a random string in the directory name (for security
purposes).  For example, ~/.mozilla/username/XXXXXXXX.slt/Cache.

&gt;<i>               Cookies ==&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>               History ==&gt;
</I>
Also dependent on the browser.  See above.

&gt;<i> CommonApplicationData ==&gt; /usr/share
</I>&gt;<i>                System ==&gt;
</I>
This is C:\Windows\System32, IIRC.  I suppose /usr/lib/, /usr/local/lib,
etc., would qualify, but as with Programs, only a single string can be
returned from Environment.GetFolderPath().

&gt;<i>          ProgramFiles ==&gt;
</I>
Ditto.

&gt;<i>            MyPictures ==&gt;
</I>
No common equivalent exists, though Gnome 2.10 might tackle this.

&gt;<i>    CommonProgramFiles ==&gt;
</I>
On Windows, C:\Program Files\Common, IIRC.  I have no idea what this
would be for Unix, though /lib, /usr/lib, etc., might work (returning us
to the &quot;Environment.GetFolderPath() can only return one string&quot; issue).
