<PRE>Before I get to what I wanted to actually write about, I just wanted to 
mention that all three new articles on www.xml.com with the big icons 
are all Mono-related.  The first article creates some Mono apps for 
hacking around with iTunes and Google searches.  The second article 
(finally) mentions www.GovTrack.us, which is Mono-powered.  And the 
third is written by Mono: A Developer's Notebook author Edd Dumbill. 
Pretty neat.

Now the meat and potatoes of the email.

I &quot;ported&quot; the Perl module Algorithm::Diff into C#.  It computes the 
differences between lists of any type of comparable object, of course 
and especially including strings.  I thought people might find it useful.

I also posted the source of my XML document pipline system (called XPD) 
that powers GovTrack.us, with instructions on how to set it up.  For 
background, see the article I wrote about it that Miguel linked from his 
blog a few weeks ago.

If anyone's looking for a C# programming project, putting these two 
libraries together as a Mono-powered Wiki would be a good one. :)
