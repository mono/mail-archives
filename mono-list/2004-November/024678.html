&gt;<i> I haven't done any web programming with Java, but I'm not sure that 
</I>&gt;<i> you'll find Mono significantly smaller or faster.  Well, it probably 
</I>&gt;<i> depends a lot on the application.
</I>
I'm not as much worried about the speed of the application as I am the 
speed of development.  Comparable execution speed is good for us.

&gt;<i> Mod_mono hides the fact that it's a separate application server fairly 
</I>&gt;<i> well, except this business of having to manually restart it.  But, it 
</I>&gt;<i> is a separate process from Apache.
</I>
That's ok.  The execution requirements of Xsp seem a lot less than that 
of Java alternatives like JBoss/Tomcat/Jetty et al.

&gt;<i> C# is definitely a step up from Java.
</I>
Which is exactly why I'm motivated to learn more... again, I'm looking 
at ways to increase our productivity, and I'm testing out some of the 
philosophies associated with C#/aspx pages compared to Java/jsp pages.  
So far, I like what I've seen.  There are a miriad of 
libraries/frameworks et al for java jsp, but a lot of that appears to be 
built into C#/mono already (ie: State management).

&gt;<i> I can't think of any serious issues, but you're bound to run into some 
</I>&gt;<i> minor problems at some point.  For instance, I had to write my own 
</I>&gt;<i> database connection pooling routines because I couldn't figure out if 
</I>&gt;<i> it was working right in the MySQL library at the time.  I also had 
</I>&gt;<i> some problems with System.Web's caching because of the way it monitors 
</I>&gt;<i> changes to files when the fam library isn't available.  This has since 
</I>&gt;<i> been fixed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, this shouldn't stop you from going ahead with C#.  Whatever 
</I>&gt;<i> problems you may find, they'll be solvable.
</I>
Good to hear.  Thanks again for the response.  I won't be rolling out 
any major application in C# any time soon, but hopefully, I'll be 
capable of doing it if the opportunity arises.

-Dennis
