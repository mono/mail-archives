<PRE>Ok, so I downloaded all the rpms and did my best to get them all
installed, which required first uninstalling previous rpms, which
red-carpet then uninstalled several dependencies.

Anyway...  I got most of the new rpms installed.  But xrender will not
install.  That's the only one I noticed right off.  Is this going to
cause me problems?  I think it's because of the switch from xfree86 to
xorg stuff.

monodevelop, monodoc, etc. seem to work.  I don't know if xrender will
cause a problem.

On a related note, why doesn't mono come with suse 9.2 rpms?  Is there
a reason for not building suse 9.2 versions?  I know suse 9.2 is new;
but mono and suse both come from the same company and it would be nice
to see them at least built for each other.  Seems like the
&quot;preference&quot; would be given to Novell's latest suse release rather
than not even seeing it on the list...

Anyway, I'm off to get some code running with suse 9.2, and since I
finally have a good monodoc working (Thanks for the tips to just use
the 9.1 rpms, which I hadn't done before), I'm going to be
contributing some documentation for stuff I find in there.
