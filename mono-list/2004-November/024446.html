<PRE>Hey all,

This is a reminder that the first seattle mono users group meeting is
happening at my place, 426 25th ave S, Seattle, WA 98144 on Saturday,
November 20th at 4:00 pm.

The venu is a little sub-par, but I'm working on that.  I don't think
that we can support more than five members at this time, so if you
intend on coming, and I don't know about it, please RSVP either by email
or phone.  You can reach my cell at 206 226 5809.

I expect this to be a working meeting.  I want to focus on becoming
familiar with the MonoDevelop codebase so that we can start contributing
to it by the next meeting.  Unless someone has a conflict with it, let's
say meetings are monthly, on the third Saturday of the month.

If anyone in the Seattle area is familiar with the MD codebase, I
strongly request you be there to point us in the right direction.

I need to head back to work, so I'll leave it at that.

Cheers,

C.J.
