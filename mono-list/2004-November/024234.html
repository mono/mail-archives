<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i>    However, the Documentation part would be standard. The only
</I>&gt;<i> extension that I need is that I want raw string and not XMLElement.
</I>
To avoid pointless discussion, I just renamed my Documentation to
DocComment (and moreover, now my patch does not hold XmlElement).
<A HREF="http://primates.ximian.com/~atsushi/mcs-doc-patches/mcs-doc-20041103.diff">http://primates.ximian.com/~atsushi/mcs-doc-patches/mcs-doc-20041103.diff</A>

So now we can discuss your patch as a standalone one.

&gt;<i>    The reason is &quot;/doc&quot; is a standard switch thought about being
</I>&gt;<i> provided in mcs as well. My patch provides basic infrastructure to it.
</I>&gt;<i> Only that it does not generate and XML-file or validate or create any
</I>&gt;<i> XML-nodes.
</I>
I cannot understand why your patch could be infrastructure for /doc
switch. At least for XML documentation my patch will never use your
code block, since it has many more required checks. Or should I use
your codebase? Is it better choice?

It makes sense if you mean that your patch is infrastructure for the
functionality that is activated with your /mcsdoc-whatever switch.

&gt;&gt;<i>other mcs hackers don't have to be bothered about whatever they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>never use.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    The patch definitely has a use -- as said above.
</I>
Ok, so you think it should be still in mcs codebase, even though
it never improves mcs itself, right?
