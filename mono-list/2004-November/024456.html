Not true, but thats fine. The recompile wont fix anything if the soname
changes.

Fine, but that is the same as compiling from tarballs. Why is compiling
from SVN so much better?

&gt;<i> Plus it does have the advantage of giving bug fixes not available in the
</I>&gt;<i> rpms ;-)
</I>
And additional bugs not available in the rpms.

Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that no one should run from SVN, but
I don't think advocating people follow your tutorial for building from
SVN just because they are having minor packaging issues is proper.

Maybe writing a tutorial about building from source tarballs instead of
from SVN would be a good idea. That way you could still link to your
website with every message you send to this list.
