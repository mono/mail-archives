&gt;<i> Hi everyone !

</I>I found these: <A HREF="http://xplib.de/mono.php">http://xplib.de/mono.php</A> last night (I was trying the
same thing as you I guess). Just a warning, you can't use wget to
download the whole lot, you must click on each in turn.  Make sure
that it doesn't try to open with a texteditor.  For somereason if I
tried to download more than two at once the third would open in a text
editor and gedit would just give an error.

The only one that gave me trouble was monodoc. There's something wrong
with his RPM.  I installed the packages that didn't depend on it, then
rebuilt the rpm with rpmbuild --rebuild monodoc*.src.rpm and then
installed it as well as the remaining rpms.

I did some quick testing last and found simple Gtk apps worked fine.

Hope this helps,
