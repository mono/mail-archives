<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Ok, thanks I understood the development situation. I still cannot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; understand why your patch must be checked in right now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Like Atsushi pointed out: there is no need to check in this code
</I>&gt;<i> immediately (and am still not convinced we should).
</I>
  Hmm... ok. It may not be checked in &quot;right now&quot;. The only reason
that I requested for it was:

  1. mcs would support &quot;/doc&quot;, even if in sometime future.
  2. My patch currently does nothing but just collect the comments.
So, it could have been the starting point.
  3. I did not know that Atsushi is already working on this... so, I
thought I've give in my code.
  4. It would have not immediately helped out mcs in anyway unless
&quot;/doc&quot; was fully supported however it would have helped in mcsdoc
since I would not have required &quot;many changes in current mcs&quot; in my
mcsdoc repository.

  As I already mentioned, currently, I have to manually track the
changes and update the local copy of mcs in my mcsdoc repository
because the cs-parser.jay in mcsdoc and in mcs differ by huge amounts.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As an example, the generics compiler has been developed on a separate
</I>&gt;<i> directory for almost a year, and we have to integrate patches every day.
</I>&gt;<i> The anonymous method code lived only on my hard drive as a copy of the
</I>&gt;<i> repository for six months, and I had to go through the same problems.
</I>
  Ok. But integrating that is a pain (I assume that's manual). Well,
if it's the same case at many places, I would also live with it... :-(

&gt;<i> I do not like the idea of checking work-in-progress code to the
</I>&gt;<i> compiler, because that code tends to be bit rot if the work is not
</I>&gt;<i> completed.
</I>
  Ok. Agree...

   Hooh! Going by the examples of &quot;generics&quot; and &quot;anonymous methods&quot;,
I'd let mcsdoc evolve separately and once done report back with final
code.
