   &gt; Hello!  Do you have experience with J#? I downloaded it but it
   &gt; doesn't work with my version of Visual Studio .NET. I was
   &gt; wondering, does J# support delegates? If so, old code can interact
   &gt; with them? i.e.: passing a delegate to a event listener.

It does not; it's entirely missing support for applets, defining new
.NET properties, events, value types, or delegates.  It's also limited
to JVM 1.1.4; I believe it's intended as a stopgap for people hooked

Hope this helps,
