<PRE>Hi.

I just experimented running an assembly created with Microsoft Visual J#
with the Mono JIT. Microsoft Visual J# produces MSIL from Java source,
targeting the runtime (and it's a FREE addon to Visual Studio!). My hope
was that I could replace a broken C# class with with a version Java that
has less bugs. ;)

The bad news:

Mono virtually &quot;exploded&quot;. I do know that some stuff regarding metadata
in assemblies is not yet implemented. But the following looks like a serious
parsing problem that ends up reporting weird binary stuff with the potential
to even crash (or create buffer overflows).

D:\dev\JSBZip2&gt;mono bin\debug\JSBZip2.exe ..\LogTest\windowsmedia_20030131.bz2
** Message: Unknown heap type:
** Message: Unknown heap type: trings
** Message: Unknown heap type:
** Message: Unknown heap type:
** Message: Unknown heap type:
** Message: Unknown heap type: lob
...
** Message: [Invalid UTF-8] Unknown heap type: ??¶?????(?1?&lt;?T?Y?^?c?h??Ç

There's plenty of binary characters being reported in the Unknown
Heap Type messages as well.

I can provide a full ILDASM /ALL dump of that assembly on request.

Christian
