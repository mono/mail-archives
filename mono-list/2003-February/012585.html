Hi,
I just got started playing around with Mono and .Net coming from a =
C++/Java
background.  I don't know if go-mono site already does some of the =
things
you're talking about, but I would be happy to help if you wanted any, or =
if
anyone wanted to start one I'll be happy to get on board as well. :-)

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can a site be created or added in go-mono.com where it focuses on Mono
</I>&gt;<i> users/developers? I think it would be nice if there is a site where =
</I>Mono
&gt;<i> users can share the applications (with sample codes) they created =
</I>using
the
&gt;<i> Mono platform. I know that there are many websites (asp.net,
</I>&gt;<i> dotnetjunkies.com, gotdotnet.com, etc) that offer the same service but
</I>most
&gt;<i> of those websites focus on .Net platform development.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By having a website for Mono users, codes can be shared to =
</I>assist/guide
&gt;<i> other users/developers that are testing the Mono platform. It also =
</I>makes
the
&gt;<i> users/developers aware about capabilities (old/new/upcoming) of the =
</I>Mono
&gt;<i> platform. Because if a sample code is in the website, it can be =
</I>assumed
that
&gt;<i> the code works on Mono platform. This will enable the Mono users get =
</I>ideas
&gt;<i> from other people and maybe use those ideas in their =
</I>development/testing.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By having samples that works on Mono, people who haven't tried Mono
</I>platform
&gt;<i> can learn the true capabilities of Mono. They can even become =
</I>interested
and
&gt;<i> start testing the Mono platform!!!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is just a suggestion to possibly attract possible users of Mono
</I>&gt;<i> platform or increase the involvement of Mono users (who cannot =
</I>participate
&gt;<i> in developing the Mono platform):).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you can't help develop Mono, help Mono gain acceptance!!!
