<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> I'll add a message that will get printed when the #- heap is found:
</I>&gt;<i> you need to compile the assemblies without the /incremental switch
</I>&gt;<i> (use the Release mode instead of the Debug one). The #- heap is an
</I>&gt;<i> internal MS format that is not standardized. Some info was posted to
</I>&gt;<i> this list a while ago: it should not be hard to support it in mono, but
</I>&gt;<i> I don't have the time to implement it right now. Any volunteers?
</I>
I do not remember reading anything that would contain useful information
about the #- heap.  Could you post your thoughts on this?

Miguel
