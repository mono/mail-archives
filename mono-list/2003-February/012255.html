Yes, but that sacrifices portability of the binary.

</I>
I would be interested to see those.

I'm sure that there are some optimizations which are better done at
the JIT level.  But there are also some which are better done at
the IL-&gt;IL level.

&gt;<i> And I can understand that, a tool working on the IL code doesn't have
</I>&gt;<i> all the info the JIT has.
</I>
That's true, but such a tool has time to compute more information than
a JIT can.  So neither has more information than the other; they have
different information.  It's useful to have optimization at both points.

&gt;<i> Anyway, even if you write an IL optimizer, the optimizations need to be
</I>&gt;<i> implemented in the JIT, too: you can't always depend on having a
</I>&gt;<i> preprocessor for IL code, think Reflection.Emit.
</I>
That is a good point; I wasn't considering that.
If you want to optimize the performance of programs which
uses Reflect.Emit to dynamically construct code on the fly,
then yes, it does make sense to put optimizations like
detecting tail recursion in the JIT.
