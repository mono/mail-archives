<PRE>Hello Miguel,

My name is David. I am a longtime fan of Linux, and have finally assembled a 
dedicated Linux box at home. Learning this OS has been interesting at the 
very least, yet very satisfying.

I am also a beginning programmer. I'm not trying to knock MS, because I 
think that they do release some great ideas and products. But the licensing 
issues! They can be difficult.

I'll be taking VB.Net in the fall. My college has nothing but MS boxes, 
which is fine for them, but I want to be able to work on my Linux box at 
home.

I was looking at go-mono.com. What software do I need to do this? Where do I 
get it? Did I miss something on the site? It looked more like a collection 
of reports than anything else.

Any help is appreciated.

Thank you,

David Timmins
