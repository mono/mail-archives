Right, and you have not told me *why* you want to require me to write a GNU 
Mailman patch so that mono development can be discussed in the open.  Your 
way is no easier to maintain then just *simply* creating a new mono mailing 
list like you have done for all the others.  In fact it is *harder* to 
maintain because it requires a hack around GNU Mailman.

&gt;<i> &gt; No, I don't think I am confused.  In your scenario I would be the only

</I>
You mean mono developers who are not on mono-hackers?  I don't know of any, 
but that is really beside the point.

&gt;<i> &gt; 2.  Write a script that will take all the subscribers of mono-hackers and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; subscribe them to mono-devel.  This is not a good solution because you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; shouldn't be subscribing people without permission and because it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; requires someone (you have volunteered me and I do not accept) to write
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the script. Better to just let everyone manage his/her own subscription
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like every other mailing list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That can be argued, and I have no strong opinion yet on that.  But I
</I>&gt;<i> feel that anyone in mono-hackers should have post rights to
</I>&gt;<i> mono-devel-list, so the patch is still required.
</I>
Ok, so everyone in mono-hackers that wishes to discuss the technical 
development of mono can subscribe.  They will have automatic post rights.  No 
patch required.

&gt;<i> I have requested the sysadmins to create the list, but it wont be
</I>&gt;<i> enabled until you send me the above described patch.
</I>
I don't see why this should be about 'Adam wanting to make this happen' 
because this concerns the entire Mono community.  Right now, mono technical 
discussion is going on behind a closed list that is not open to all mono 
developers.  This is a matter of openness.
