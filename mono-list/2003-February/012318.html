<PRE>&gt;<i> - The performance of the RSACryptoServiceProvider seems abysmal. Just
</I>&gt;<i> starting up and reading a key using FromXmlString is really really slow,
</I>&gt;<i> like orders of magnitude slower than under XP/.NET.
</I>
Reading a keypair shouldn't be so slow. However generating keypairs is VERY
slow.

There's a design bug in MS.NET crypto. Each time you create an RSA object
(without naming a container in CspParameters) a new keypair is generated
(which is really BAD when you do crypto in a server application). For
compatibility reason this behaviour is also present in Mono but is delayed
until you actually use the keypair (so it should not affect code that import
a keypair before using it) __unless__ you provide a keysize in the
constructor [*].

* I'll probably change this behaviour as it's not really required.

&gt;<i> Any ideas why this might be?
</I>
Sure :-)

Mono has a 100% C# implementation for all it's cryptography (well except
RNG). MS use the default CSP (unmanaged) to provide much of it's crypto.

This means that:
- unmanaged code is (most of the time) faster than managed code - even more
when we're talking about heavily optimized unamanaged code (like MS CSP);
- the performance of the compiler and the JIT are much more important for
Mono than MS (which means that the crypto performance will get better - even
without any further optimization ;-).

But there are many advantage in having a managed implementation.

&gt;<i> Is there a profiler for Mono ?
</I>
Yes , however I've never used it (someone else may help you with this).
However I did use the &quot;Community Edition of DevPartner Profiler&quot; (with
VS.NET) which is excellent.

If you're interested in optimizing the math part (where the RSA
implementation needs help) send an email to Ben Mauer
(<A HREF="mailto:webmaster@theratnerschool.org">webmaster@theratnerschool.org</A>). He is doing optimizations on the BigInteger
class (well last time we talked it looked more like a total rewrite). So
asymmetric performance should improve but will never match the performance
of hand-tuned implementation (like MS).
