Adam, this was already explained to you both on IRC an on this list.
The policy for inclusion is very easy: do something for mono. Miguel
has handed out subscriptions to the list and cvs accounts very
liberally.
Your exclusion has very little to do with your interest in others CLRs
(pnet uses my own code and I'm still subscribed to mono-hackers:-).
The mono-hackers access is a matter of trust.
You lost the trust when you proposed to fork the code in the mono
assemblies. Now, you can argue that that wasn't a good reason for
losing trust in you since you have been a user/helper of mono from almost 
the very beginning. The fact is, though, that since then, you have done
_nothing_ to regain the trust. And some of your mails don't help
either, like this one, because the questions here where already
publically answered on the list, so it looks like you're just trying to
stir things instead of helping the project.
I know it has been frustrating for you, but don't think it's any less
frustrating for us.

Thanks.
