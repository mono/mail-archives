<PRE>I am looking at trying to get started, but I am, in general a newbie in
Linux.I would like to spend an hour a day helping out. I think C# is
cool. I program for a living on Windows, and my motivations for wanting
to help are:

1) I believe you have to code at least an hour a day to keep your skills
sharp and I have gotten myself into a position where I am not coding as
much as I used to.

2) I think .NET and C# are really cool and would love to see it working
everywhere.

What I have done

I have the CVS stuff working. I have a shell script that runs the
following commands (according to the go-mono website instructions) and
it seems to execute OK.

	export CVSROOT=:pserver:<A HREF="mailto:anonymous@anoncvs.go-mono.com">anonymous@anoncvs.go-mono.com</A>:/mono
	cvs -z3 update -dP mcs mono gtk-sharp

The CVS scripts seem to have created a directory off of my home directory called mono. I am logged into my system under an id that does not have root access. I have not tried to build anything from this source.

I also got mono through the Red Carpet service, and mcs works, although I really don't know where it was put on my Redhat 7.1 system or what system variables were set so that it knew enough to find mcs.

So what do I need?

1) Where did Red Carpet put the mono binaries?
2) How do I build mono from the CVS source so that it does not screw up my existing mono installed from red Carpet?
3) I need some help building an effective build environment (I want to help build mono).

Sorry for such newbie questions, but I have to start somewhere.

Steve
