Because the default is to trust people, so it's very easy to get in.
Later trust in you was lost, for whatever reason, so you were excluded
from a list whose members we trust.

You have been removed from the list on 2002-11-20, after two weeks of
pondering. These logs are after that, so they could not be used as a
basis for a different judgement at the time:-)

&gt;<i> this was settled and I dropped it completely.  I am only asking for Miguel to follow through.  The
</I>&gt;<i> initial email that sparked this thread was a simple, 'Hey, what's up with mono-devel'?
</I>
What makes you think a mail on mono-list would have had more effect that
a private mail? I'll tell you an important secret address:
<A HREF="mailto:miguel@ximian.com">miguel@ximian.com</A> :-)

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; In fact, Miguel has publicly stated that Portable.NET, DotGNU, Rotor, Intel, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Evil Company are all welcome to work on and use Mono's class libraries (this 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The license allows that. The license doesn't allow them to pretend to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have access to the mono-hackers list.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Whaahhh?  I have no idea what you are trying to say here.  Once again, I am not asking for access
</I>&gt;<i> to Ximian secrets or 'confidential information'.  You've asked that I not misrepresent your views
</I>&gt;<i> and I would kindly ask the same.
</I>
It was an example to point out that anyone would have been removed from 
mono-hackers if they intended to do harm to the mono project, no matter
the license of the assemblies. Forking the code does harm the project.

&gt;<i> &gt; If I lost your trust, let me know privately what I should do to gain it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; back (hey, if you ever travel near Venice or Padua here in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Italy, be sure to send me mail and we'll share a bottle of wine:-).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you have similar issues with someone else in the project, do it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; privately, a public mailing list is not the best medium for settling
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; personal issues. If you can't reconcile the positions, ignore
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some people and carry on with your contributions, like many people do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in large projects.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was just responding to what you said about how I should 'do something' to gain trust.  It is
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to not take this personally.  
</I>
When I said we expected you to do something to regain the trust it was
because I (and I'm sure miguel, too) would love to have you working
together with us again. You should start taking it personally if I send
you a mail with &quot;banner f*ck off |mail &quot; ... ;-)

&gt;<i> Fine.  Once again, I am not looking for access to any confidential information.  I just think the
</I>&gt;<i> mono development discussion should take place in an open forum as we have all agreed.  I don't
</I>
A mono-devel mailing list was already in the plans for a long time.
It hasn't been done because it's not a priority: most of the
non-confidential technical discussions happen on mono-list anyway
or on IRC. Anyway, the list will be announced soon, hopefully that will
put an end to this thread:-)

&gt;<i> Thank you for your nice invitation.  Next time you visit Boston I'd like to extend the same
</I>&gt;<i> invitation :-)
</I>
Noted:-)
