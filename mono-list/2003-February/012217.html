<PRE>&gt;<i> No, we support resources just fine. The issue was with the alignment

Okay, cool. I checked out the sourcecode and recompiled the Mono runtime.

Now it appears to load my own J# compiled assembly just fine.
The example is a simple J# application, performing only a simple

  System.out.println(&quot;Hello World!\n&quot;);


However Microsoft's assemblies (vjs*.dll) won't load still. *sigh*

D:\dev\JSHello\bin\Debug&gt;mono JSHello.exe
** Message: Unknown heap type: #-

Unhandled Exception: System.NullReferenceException: A null value was found where
 an object instance was required

I find it interesting that there is no indication where this exception
occured. Also I think the Unknown Heap Type message should print which
assembly it tried to load and at what position in the file this error 
occured.
