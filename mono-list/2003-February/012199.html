<PRE>It should be noted that C# development can also be done from Windows. 
It should be possible to write portions of the class library purely in
C#.  Test cases can also be done under Windows, as running them against
.NET provides validation for the test cases.  (Or we find .NET bugs,
which has happened before.)

With that out of the way...  Your questions:

1) Where did Red Carpet put the mono binaries?

	The mono-0.19 RPM for Red Hat 8.0 places installs the files with
	a prefix of &quot;/usr&quot;.  In short, binaries (mcs.exe, mono, etc.)
	are placed in /usr/bin, Assemblies (corlib.dll, System.dll) are
	in /usr/lib, etc.

	I would imagine that all provided RPMs put files in the same 
	places.

2) How do I build mono from the CVS source so that it does not screw up
my existing mono installed from red Carpet?

	Short answer: change the prefix to be something other than /usr.

	Long answer.  When you &quot;make -f makefile.gnu&quot; in the mcs
	directory, you need to provide a &quot;prefix&quot;, which is the root
	directory under which everything will be installed.  To change
	where your programs are, change the prefix, e.g.:

		make -f makefile.gnu install prefix=~/mono/install

	Just to be different, the &quot;mono&quot; module uses a configure script,
	which is generated from the &quot;autogen.sh&quot; script.  Just pass 
	--prefix to this script:

		cd &lt;path-to-mono&gt;/mono
		./autogen.sh --prefix=~/mono/install

	Make sure that the prefix you specify is the same for both mcs
	and mono.  Executables are placed under $prefix/bin, assemblies
	under $prefix/lib, etc.

I'd like to say that this is everything you need to know.  Well, it
isn't.  Experience helps, but that can be hard to summarize.

Another problem is that things don't currently work as well as
expected.  It's been reported that &quot;mcs&quot; is generating compile errors
when compiled with the mcs distributed with mono-0.19.  In other words,
it can't bootstrap itself.  This was just reported, so I'm not sure what
the workaround is, and thus it might be prudent to wait for the
solution.  (Or, if you're brave, do it anyway and edit the mcs code to
remove the errors mono-0.19's mcs is reporting.  I don't know if this
works, though.)

Hope this helps.
