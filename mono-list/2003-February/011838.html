</I>&gt;<i> Ok, so far this whole discussion was about you wanting to join a private mailing list of

</I>&gt;<i> problem by providing that GNU Mailman patch which makes things work for everyone.
</I>
Ok, could you please reread this thread.  I am not asking to join mono-hackers again.  I simply
wish to be included in the development discussion of Mono.  If Miguel wishes to use mono-hackers
for relating secrets and confidential information then ok, please setup a list for the open
discussion.  One list for open development discussion and one list for Ximian secrets and
confidential information about Mono.  Already agreed to.
 
&gt;<i> Everything you did so far was complaining and wasting everybody's time, so can we please
</I>&gt;<i> stop this discussion or at least move it into private mail (where people can decide just
</I>&gt;<i> to ignore it) instead of spamming a public mailing list with such a silly discussion.
</I>
No, that is not everything I've done.  I am asking for Miguel to follow through on something he
has already agreed to.  If you do not wish to see this thread continue then don't misstate what I
have said and then expect me to drop it.
