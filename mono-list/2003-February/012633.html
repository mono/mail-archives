<PRE>I think the original writer was specifically interested in a port of VB 6.0
to Mono, rather than compatibility with VB.NET.

For long time users of VB (I go back to Version 1.0 myself), the changes
made by Microsoft in VB.NET are considered an abandonment of some of the key
features, and a break with compatibility.

I've been able to get over it myself by spending some time learning the CLR,
and developing in C#, which is probably an easier leap than trying to
remember all of differences between VB 6.0 and VB.NET.  But then I never
developed much with VB 6.0.  Some of the developers in our company are
finding it very hard to jump from VB 6.0 to VB.NET.

If someone were willing to make VB 6.0 compatibility, there would probably
be an interested set of followers, but in the long run, most VB 6.0 people
are probably going to accept the inevitable and go to VB.NET (or some other
CLR-based language).  The alternative is to go to Delphi, which many are
considering.
