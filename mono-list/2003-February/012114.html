<PRE>&lt;Argh! I accidentally replied directly to Chris and not the list&gt;

Let me start by stating that I haven't tried running anything under Mono
yet, so I could be way off base here.

There's actually a pretty good article on running multiple versions of the
runtime here:
<A HREF="http://www.3leaf.com/default/articles/ea/SBS.aspx">http://www.3leaf.com/default/articles/ea/SBS.aspx</A>

It goes into a little more detail about what runtime the app will try to use
under different conditions, and how to force it to use a particular version
by tweaking config files. I would imagine that Mono would take advantage of
the binding redirection they mention to make the app think it's running on a
1.0-compatible runtime. You're right about 1.1-specific features, though -
if my app was compiled against 1.1 and uses 1.1-specific features, I won't
be able to un my app under Mono until Mono catches up. However, that issue
is familiar to many developers: don't use new features unless 100% of your
clients have access to them (or you happen to like lots of support phone
calls).

Subject: [Mono-list] mono / .net framework 1.1 / roadmap


&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having just read the overview for  MS's .NET framework  1.1beta, I was
</I>&gt;<i> wondering what the Mono teams's position is regarding such further
</I>&gt;<i> technology developments like this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't mean with regards to the specific new features like
</I>&gt;<i> System.Data.Oracle etc. but more in general, for example, whether the
</I>&gt;<i> development on a 1.0 mono will continue regardless of changes brought
</I>&gt;<i> about in 1.1 or if there is even a correlation here. Is there a roadmap
</I>&gt;<i> related to the development of mono in relation to the development of the
</I>&gt;<i> .NET framework in general?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am also wondering to what extent people see this development as another
</I>&gt;<i> MS attempt to keep things incompatitible. In particular, I am troubled by
</I>&gt;<i> the following statement:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * If an application written with the .NET Framework 1.1 Beta is installed
</I>&gt;<i> on a system with only the .NET Framework 1.0 Redistributable, it will not
</I>&gt;<i> run (unless configured to do so).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (ref:<A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/productinfo/next/overview.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/productinfo/next/overview.asp</A>)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Am I reading too much into that statement? Probably... ;-) There is not
</I>&gt;<i> even a mention of mono - but to me it sounds like as soon as 1.1 gains
</I>&gt;<i> acceptance, any apps developed with it would no longer run with mono
</I>&gt;<i> (which would make sense, assuming they are using 1.1 specific features,
</I>&gt;<i> but not necessarily in general - although &quot;if configured to do so&quot; it
</I>&gt;<i> might work either way...).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I dunno... its all starting to get pretty confusing to me, what seemed
</I>&gt;<i> so simple and elegant at first... Interested in hearing all of your
</I>&gt;<i> feedback on the issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> --chris
</I>&gt;<i>
