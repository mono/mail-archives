<PRE>&gt;<i> Mono virtually &quot;exploded&quot;. I do know that some stuff regarding metadata
</I>&gt;<i> in assemblies is not yet implemented. 
</I>
Here is a followup in regard to Mono choking on M$ J# code. ILDASM did
not only generate a file containing ILASM code, but also a produced .res
file (resource file). That suggests Mono currently cannot yet deal with
embedded resources in the managed assembly - or with that particular
resource format generated by Microsoft Visual J#.

Reassembling the code with ILASM without including the Resource fixed the
problem preventing to load the assembly. I have to do the same processing
with vjscore and vjslib (the Java runtime assemblies) in order to remove
the resource part.

I am very curious if this will finally execute. Would be a &quot;first&quot;, I guess ;)
