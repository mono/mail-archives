<PRE>Howdy folks,

I picked up where Daniel Morgan left off with the Mono OracleClient,
and this client uses a &quot;glue&quot; library to connect the managed provider
with the unmanaged Oracle call interface (OCI).  This is written in
C.  Daniel had written makefiles for Borland and Visual C; I created
a simple make file that works with GCC on my system.  

I was wondering how easy it would be to create some sort of automake
solution that would build this automatically as part of the class
library build.  I know very little about automake, so I'm willing
to take any suggestions, code, whatever.  If you want to do it yourself,
you're more than welcome.

Before we build the code, I think that it should probably be moved
from its present home, but for now it works where it is.  It's
in mcs/class/System.Data.OracleClient/System.Data.OracleClient.
The two source files are ociglue.c and ociglue.h.

The makefile must make use of the user's install Oracle client libraries,
and if these aren't detected, then the glue library probably shouldn't
be built.  In fact, in light of this, maybe the OCI glue library should
be in a separate module.  I'm not really sure what the best policy is
for something like this.

Any insights would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks,
