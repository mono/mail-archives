&gt;<i> Hello,

</I>&gt;<i> Here is the deal.  When developing apps in C# or VB.NET there is no &quot;masked textbox&quot; available
</I>&gt;<i> in the standard (MS) framework.  When searching for this on Goggle, one sees quite a few people
</I>&gt;<i> looking for this functionality.  Anyway, my brother wrote one that inherits from text box and

</I>&gt;<i> other nice enhancements.  He would like to contribute his code to the Mono project.  He asked me
</I>&gt;<i> if I (being a member of this list) would find out how to get the code submitted.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know if this is the appropriate place to ask this question or not, but I'm sure if it
</I>&gt;<i> isn't, that someone will be able to point us in the right place.

The System.Windows.Forms namespace for mono is not complete and I am not sure if mono has plans
for a third party SWF library at this point, but with that said, you can always post the code to
one of the many Windows Forms sites that take third party controls.  Here is one for instance:

<A HREF="http://windowsforms.net/Default.aspx?tabindex=8&tabid=50">http://windowsforms.net/Default.aspx?tabindex=8&amp;tabid=50</A>

I am sure there are others and if you would feel like contributing GPL code then I would suggest
SharpDevelop ... they might be interested, but I am not sure.
