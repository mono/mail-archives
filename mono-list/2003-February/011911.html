</I>
Perhaps I should have been more clear. I didn't mean to make any statements
invalid :).

We have a build that runs on cygwin on Windows that uses csc and MS .NET and
provides, among other benefits, a verification for the build that runs on
mono (*nix or Windows). This doesn't have anything to do, per se, with self
hosting. This build uses some makefile(s) and some .build files with NAnt
and assumes csc and MS .NET.

We have a separate build system made entirely of makefile.gnu(s) that
assumes mono and mcs. This build system is the self hosting one.

At least that's the way I understand it.

|<i> Isn't there an easy way to specify which csharp compiler?

</I>|<i> Like maybe &quot;export CSHARPCOMPILER = /usr/local/bin/mcs.exe&quot;  or something?
</I>
I don't know how smart we can make the build system, but I would like to
just say one of these:
  'make runtime=mono'  &lt;== this defaults to using mcs
  'make runtime=dotnet'  &lt;== this defaults to using csc
  'make runtime=dotnet compiler=mcs' &lt;== to override the default

and the makefile knows what to do. Perhaps the system could also allow one
to tweak things, such as the exact mcs binary image to use as you suggest
above.

This would be quite handy for different test scenarios and verification
purposes.

I'm not very good with makefiles, or I would have tried to set this up
myself long ago ;)

Regards,
Nick D.

P.S. did you mean to just reply to me?  Perhaps this should go to the
mono-list as well?
