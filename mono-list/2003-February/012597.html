<PRE>Hello everyone!

     We have just released Mono 0.21, only a few days after 0.20 due
mainly to a bug in the compiler which made it abort on top-level enums
and delegates on Windows. 

     In the meantime, various other minor bugs were fixes on the class
libraries, the runtime and the compiler.  Mono is available at the
usual location:

	<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/download.html">http://www.go-mono.com/download.html</A>

     We released packages for SuSE 8.0, Mandrake 8.2, and various Red
Hat releases.  Alp has contributed Debian packages as well.  Tomorrow we
should have Windows, Red Hat 8 and Red Carpet binaries.

   Source code for Mono, MCS, and XSP is available as well from that
web page.  The sources are:

     MCS package (Class Libraries, C# and VB.NET compiler and managed
tools):

	<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mcs-0.21.tar.gz">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mcs-0.21.tar.gz</A>

     Mono package (Runtime engine, JIT compiler):

	<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-0.21.tar.gz">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-0.21.tar.gz</A>

     XSP package (XSP test web server for ASP.NET webforms):

	<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/xsp-0.3.tar.gz">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/xsp-0.3.tar.gz</A>

    The contributors since version 0.20 were: Alan Tam, Atsushi
Enomoto, Daniel Lopez, Dave Bettin, Dick Porter, Dietmar Maurer,
Duncan Mak, Gonzalo Paniagua, Kevin Breit, Lluis Sanchez, Martin
Baulig, Miguel de Icaza, Mike Kestner, Nick Drochak, Paolo Molaro, Per
Arneng, Peter Williams, Rafael Teixeira, Reggie Burnett, Tim Coleman,
Ville Palo and Zoltan Varga.

    This release consists of 238 group commits.  

* Highlights of the release:

    * System.Data

	Bug fixes from Aleksey (our first contributor from
	Siberia!), Alan, Ville and Tim.

	Tim also has continued his work on the OracleClient provider.
	Ville in particular expanded the Expression handling in
	System.Data.

    * Reflection

	Bug fixes to custom attribute from Gonzalo and Paolo (this
	gets XmlRpc moving a bit more).

    * Remoting

	infrastructure. 

    * Windows.Forms

	New improvements from Reggie, 

    * System.XML

	Bug fixes from Atsushi, and Alan.  Alan has also made
	XmlConvert better comply with the XML Schema definition.

Enjoy!
Miguel.
