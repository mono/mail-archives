&gt;<i> I understand the Dragon books point about LR grammars vs LL grammars. I made
</I>&gt;<i> a reference to it in an earlier message.
</I>
Sorry.  I had missed that reference.

&gt;<i> &gt; To put it another way, an LR parser works by following the *reverse* of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a right-recursive derivation.  This allows each input token to be a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; handle that can be used as part of the shift/reduce parsing process.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; An LL parser, on the other hand, effectively needs to read in the entire
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; file before it can start applying any reductions to avoid ambiguities,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; leading to increased memory requirements and slower parsing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your conclusion about LL parsing efficiency is inaccurate IMHO. LL parsing
</I>&gt;<i> isn't inefficient compared to LR parsing (both can be implemented as
</I>&gt;<i> tablelookups or procedurally) unless the language in question requires
</I>&gt;<i> copious amounts of lookahead/backtracking. Most languages don't. C++
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't. C# doesn't.
</I>
My mistake.  It was apparently a gross over-generalization that we went
over in class.  *Worst Case* LL would need to read in the whole file. 
But that seldom occurs in programming languages (likely because no
compiler developer in their right mind would make such a grammar).

&lt;snip/&gt;

&gt;<i> Many (most?) of the well-known commmercial compilers use hand-coded
</I>&gt;<i> recursive descent (RD) parsers. The ease of development, flexibility (esp in
</I>&gt;<i> error handling) and performance of RD parsers based on LL(k) grammars is an
</I>&gt;<i> oft-cited reason. All the same benefit that ANTLR provides.
</I>
I haven't heard about what commercial compilers use.  I do know that GCC
uses bison, though they have a hand-coded recursive decent parser for
C++.  C is apparently using the previous, bison-generated, parser.

Thank you for your commentary.  I appreciate the feedback.

 - Jon
