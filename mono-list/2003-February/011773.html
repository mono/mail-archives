<PRE>Hello,

    I understand that it is easier for *you* to do things your way.  The
way I want the mailing list setup is the same used in Gnome, and that is
what *I* personally want the setup to be.   We can argue about which one
is best, but so far I fail to see the point.  I have told you how you
can fix and improve things.  Its your turn.

&gt;<i> No, I don't think I am confused.  In your scenario I would be the only real 
</I>&gt;<i> subscriber to mono-devel and everyone else would be subscribed to 
</I>
No.  Many other people would be subscribed to mono-devel-list, those
sharing your same interests for example.  

&gt;<i> 2.  Write a script that will take all the subscribers of mono-hackers and 
</I>&gt;<i> subscribe them to mono-devel.  This is not a good solution because you 
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't be subscribing people without permission and because it requires 
</I>&gt;<i> someone (you have volunteered me and I do not accept) to write the script.  
</I>&gt;<i> Better to just let everyone manage his/her own subscription like every other 
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list.
</I>
That can be argued, and I have no strong opinion yet on that.  But I
feel that anyone in mono-hackers should have post rights to
mono-devel-list, so the patch is still required.

I have requested the sysadmins to create the list, but it wont be
enabled until you send me the above described patch.

Miguel
