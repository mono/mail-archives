</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trolled the net looking for ODBC drivers for Oracle that aren't tragically
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; crippled like the current offerings from OpenLink and DataDirect.  I have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; had quite some level of success with setting up the Oracle client on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; client machine, and can work with the database via SQLNet so I know that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Net8 stuff is all fine &amp; dandy on the client machine ( a linux box running
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; RedHat 8)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have pretty well given up on using ODBC and are now looking at libgda as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the means of communication ( probably the better of the two anyway ).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>wise decision to look at libgda :-)

&gt;<i> &gt; However, after downloading all the libgda sources and RPM's from the GnomeDB
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ftp site, I note that there is no sign of an Oracle provider for gda.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>no, we don't have packages for the oracle provider. So you should
compile the sources directly, having the oracle libs and headers
installed. Then, when running configure on the libgda sources, it will
detect (you might need a --with-oracle argument to configure) them and
build the oracle provider.

Or you could try to tweak the spec file (included in the libgda tarball)
and add support for building the oracle provider RPM. If you do that,
please send me the resulting RPM, so that I put it on ftp.gnome-db.org

anyway, there are a few improvements on the Oracle provider in CVS that
are not in the released 0.10 tarball. So if you can use CVS, please use
it, it will work much better than the one in 0.10.

cheers
