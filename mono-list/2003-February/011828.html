Interestingly, this is the reason given for the creation of mono-hackers.  A place for developers
to discuss mono without the normal chatter on the general list.

As has been pointed out by Miguel (to which I have answered) ... yes, I acknowledge, mono has
several lists.  Nevertheless, mono-hackers is the designated place where the technical discussion
of Mono by developers takes place.  At least this is what mono-hackers was intended to be (see
Miguel's email on the creation of mono-hackers) and was always used for when I was subscribed to
mono-hackers.  So, you see, it does not matter if I use some other forum for technical discussion,
because this still excludes me when others are using a different forum to carry on these
conversations.

Let's be clear what I am asking for and why this discussion is even taking place.  I simply wish
to be included in the *technical discussion of mono* (mono-hackers is the appointed place for
this) and if Miguel wishes to have a secret list where he can discuss his secrets then so be it. 
We already settled this when the issue came up the last time.  Miguel offered to create an open
list for development discussion and I dropped it.

That list has still not been created after I have asked Miguel in private conversations for an
update.  He has now refused to create the list until I write a silly patch to GNU Mailman which I
neither know anything about nor care anything about.
