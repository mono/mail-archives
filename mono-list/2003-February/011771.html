You can achieve the same result with no patch and no extra maintenance by 
simply creating mono-devel like you have all the other lists.  You can post a 
link to this list on go-mono.org and everyone who is interested in the 
technical discussion of mono development can subscribe.  mono-hackers can 
then become a place for you to distribute confidential information.  The 
benefit is clear ... No one needs to hack GNU Mailman and mono-devel can be 
an open list while you keep a list for confidential information.

&gt;<i> &gt; It is not a matter of what *I* use to discuss mono development if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; everyone else is using mono-hackers.  Why on earth would I want to join a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mailing list where I am the only subscriber?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You are confused.  I hope my explanation above would clarify things.
</I>
No, I don't think I am confused.  In your scenario I would be the only real 
subscriber to mono-devel and everyone else would be subscribed to 
mono-hackers with GNU Mailman shuttling my messages back and forth.  This 
would be a hack and people subscribed to mono-hackers would not be able to 
adjust the settings for the mono-devel subscription. For instance they would 
not be able to stop receiving mail from mono-devel for awhile. Since 
mono-devel will likely be a high traffic list this isn't such a good idea.  
Two alternatives exist: 

1.  Setup mono-devel like you have every other mailing list and let people 
subscribe to that in the normal uniform fashion.

2.  Write a script that will take all the subscribers of mono-hackers and 
subscribe them to mono-devel.  This is not a good solution because you 
shouldn't be subscribing people without permission and because it requires 
someone (you have volunteered me and I do not accept) to write the script.  
Better to just let everyone manage his/her own subscription like every other 
mailing list.

Why is this so difficult?
