<PRE>I read a some of these discussions, but gave it up when it
became clear that most of the people had no idea what was
going on. Kudos to Miguel for staying the course and not
responding to the petty remarks directed at him. Mono is
a remarkable project...I will never go back to C++!

FWIW, I was contacted by an MS employee -- I don't know
anything about his role or responsibilities -- about the
possibility of using wx.NET as a GUI library for Rotor.
So they are out there, watching, listening... ;)
