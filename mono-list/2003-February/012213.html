<PRE>Hi,

I have FreeBSD 4.7
I just fetch monodoc from CVS.

I have multiple questions / remark:

1].
I tryed 'gmake' and it failed.
after looking the code of the makefile (4 lines... :-)

I replace=20
=09=09(cd $$i; make) || exit 1;=09\
by
=09=09(cd $$i; $(MAKE)) || exit 1;=09\

And it worked.
the default make of FreeBSD don't have any -C option, it's why it's bette=
r to=20
do like this.

2].
after building it, well I tryed it.
And I get this terrible insult message hundreds of time.

** (&lt;unknown&gt;:31001): WARNING **: Failed to load library libgtkhtml-3.0.s=
o=20
(gtkhtml-3.0): Shared object &quot;libgtkhtml-3.0.so&quot; not found

the diagnostic being clear enough I tryed to upgrade my system with the l=
atest=20
libgtkhtml.
And here is the big problem. it looks like the latest version available a=
round=20
there is 2.2 .....
what do you think ?

3].
I know that mono has a file to 'translate' DllImport.
maybe I could edit this file and replace libgtkhtml-3.0 by libgtkhtml-.2.=
2 ?=20
at least I could try...

Could you tell me what is this file, where I could find it, etc ?.....

4].
csc has a special file called '...' (I can't remember, something like csc=
=2Ersc)=20
where it put all default library (System.Drawing.dll, etc...), so you don=
't=20
have to link explicitly against this library.
What about mcs ? (it obvioulsy has one too) I mean, what's its name ? whe=
re is=20
it ? could I also have one in my working directory, just like csc ?
