<PRE>mbas isn't the answer to his question.  mbas is implementing the Visual
Basic .NET language, while Pomerantz Daniel is asking for a
VB6-compatible language.  As he mentions, they're not the same language.

It's possible that mbas could be extended to support VB6 syntax, but I
don't know how feasible/practical that is.  It might be better to fork
mbas for VB6 support, assuming that it's practical to do that.
