<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Certainly, if you want a server to make a call to an object in a client that
</I>&gt;<i> is behind a firewall, you cannot use TcpChannel. It is not designed for
</I>&gt;<i> that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, this is a limitation of the TcpChannel, not a limitation of
</I>&gt;<i> Remoting. It is possible to implement a remoting channel that allows
</I>&gt;<i> bi-directional communication between a firewalled client and a server. For
</I>&gt;<i> example, a SMTP/POP3 based channel ;-). The remoting infrastructure is
</I>&gt;<i> indeed very flexible.
</I>
You could also create an ssh-tunnel if you are behind a firewall to
establish a private connection to the target system (which at the time
you have performed a uni-directional call, means that you most likely
can establish also an ssh-tunnel).

It would be also possible to create a bidirectional tcp-based channel
that does the same: provides a tunnel where bi-directional traffic can
live.

This is relatively simple, and should be a good exercise for those of
you pondering doing a fun project.

Miguel.
