I haven't actually worked on the provider since the summer, but it
should be there.  It is possible that you are working with an older
version.  I'm not sure if the version of libgda which contains the
Oracle provider is available in Red Hat 8.  You might also need to 
download a separate package to get the Oracle provider. I believe
this is the case on debian.

Check out <A HREF="http://www.gnome-db.org">http://www.gnome-db.org</A> for more information. 

One thing you might find interesting is that Daniel Morgan
(<A HREF="mailto:danmorg@sc.rr.com">danmorg@sc.rr.com</A>) was working on a Mono Oracle provider.
I'm not sure how far along he got with it.  I would really
like to see that project succeed.  It uses the Oracle Call
Interface as a shared library, without using libgda at all.
We wish to implement the Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 
System.Data.OracleClient namespace at some point.

If you have any other questions, please feel free to send me more
mail.

Thanks,
