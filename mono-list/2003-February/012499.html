<PRE>Hi!

With some help from Gonzalo and Miguel i managed to sort some things out =
about=20
encodings and charsets. So now most of that is implemented. Thnx! :)

Summary of what is left :
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
------------------------------------
     * Base64 encode subject &gt;7bit
     * E-mail address parsing
     * UUEncoding
     * Test cases and docs

Details:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
------------------------------------
The stuff that is left to do now is to encode the the Subject with Base64=
 like=20
MS does if the encoding is not 7bit/char in length.=20
Like this:
=09=3D?iso-8859-1?B?VGVzdFNlbmRfMTEgW+Tk5ORd?=3D

This is not optimal because QP would probably be better for those who rea=
d=20
mail with telnet and POP3 :) but this is what .NET runtime does so we wil=
l do=20
it to, at least for now.

The body part is just thrown in there without any extra transformation li=
ke=20
quoted printable, uuencode, base64 and such. At least that is what the .N=
ET=20
runtime does what i have seen. But more research on that is needed :)=20

After that is finished there is the issues with the mail addresses. After=
=20
reading the docs i thought that To,Cc,From allowed an email address but t=
hat=20
is not the case so i have to parse those before sending.

And then its UUEncoding.. since that and Base64 are the two used for=20
attachments in .NET i have to add UUEncoding to. And UUEncoding is the=20
default encoding on attachments.

And of course.. Test cases .. and More Test cases.. and Documentation wor=
k.

mail suggestions, bugs, tips and any feedback... =20

//Per (local time is now 06:25 am .. me no function sleep well without)
