<PRE>&gt;<i>COM, DCOM, XPCOM, SOAP, CORBA, WS, REST, DCOP are communication
</I>protocols
&gt;<i>and/or component model standards. All this has nothing to do with
</I>&gt;<i>EnterpriseServices. Communication is covered by Remoting, and the CLR
</I>&gt;<i>itself defines the component model. EnterpriseServices is only about
</I>&gt;<i>providing services to .NET objects.
</I>
&gt;<i>In MS.NET, those services are provided by COM+. In Mono, we could
</I>implement
&gt;<i>those services from scratch, or just build bindings to existing
</I>software
&gt;<i>that provide them.
</I>
That's actually exactly my point. I just wanted to know if I were going
to get crucified for suggesting that we not re-implement all of COM+
unless we have to ;-)

&gt;<i>IMHO, what would be really interesting is to have a C# implementation
</I>of
&gt;<i>all those services. But this may be lot of work (it is like writting a
</I>full
&gt;<i>featured app server), and it is not clear to me whether it should be
</I>part
&gt;<i>of mono or not.
</I>
I do think that our implementation should be 100% (or as close to it as
possible) managed code. The System.EnterpriseServices IMHO _SHOULD_ be
apart of Mono because it makes developers more powerful and is a
(sometime overlooked) part of .NET. 

&gt;<i> In addition, the other question is where the ServicedComponets are
</I>&gt;<i> actually run. For ActivationOption.Library, the process can be run
</I>&gt;<i> either in application process or in the SYSTEM process. If you run it
</I>in
&gt;<i> ApplicationOption.Server, it will pick some other process (inetinfo
</I>for
&gt;<i> example) to run in. Where would be a good place to save the server
</I>&gt;<i> component?
</I>
Sorry. Flub on my part. Save==Run
&gt;<i>You should be able to save it wherever you like. There is no need for a
</I>&gt;<i> repository of server objects (other than the GAC). Any component
</I>running in
&gt;<i> any process should be able to make use of the services provided by
</I>&gt;<i> EnterpriseServices.
</I>
So some sort of P2P or WS-Group protocol for discovery and routing?
