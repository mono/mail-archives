<PRE>First of all, I'd like to thank every one who's working on this
project!  Great idea, and great job!  I'd love to help out, but my
knowledge of .NET is not up to par yet, which kindof brings me to my
question:  Has there been any discussion of implementing a CIL compiler
for Visual Basic as the language existed in MS VB 6.0?  Microsoft's
changes to the VB language has put several developers at a disadvantage
of having to practically learn an entirely new language.  There are a
multitude of VB6 programmers out there who would love to get involved
with .NET, but don't have the language skills yet.  Just as MS created
j# to port Java, I see no reason why VB 6 couldn't also be compiled to
MSIL.  I wouldn't expect system services such as COM/COM+ to be
available, but with the limited OO ability of VB 6, it should be
possible.  This is a project I would be willing and able to work on.

Thank you,

Daniel
