<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> This does not change our plans.  You can read the FAQ, and look at the
</I>&gt;<i> question of how we will deal with patents that can not be used by free
</I>&gt;<i> software.
</I>
Whether we deny software patents or not, it would be good if anyone
proves that the technology of .NET API is *basic* and *pre-existed*
as written in the Mono FAQ.

I don't know well about U.S. patent law, but I know that if technology
is pre-existed, it loses their entitlement about its novelty.
In this case, Microsoft's (provisional?) application was at early 2002,
so it is informative to the juror of the Patent Office if it became
clear that their technology had already existed before that year,
even only theoretically stuff at any papers.

Maybe it is much easier topic for you developers than legal stuff :)


Cheers,

  Atsushi Eno
