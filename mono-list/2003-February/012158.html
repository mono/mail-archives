Note that this option is not even available if the USPTO grants this patent and Microsoft decides
to enforce it.  The patent does not just cover non-ecma api's it also covers may parts of the core
libraries.  This is basically a patent on the entire collection of .NET class libraries ... both
ECMA and non-ECMA.  The ECMA parts are of course subject to the RAND policy, but AFAIK, RAND means
'reasonable and non-discriminatory' which != royalty free :(
