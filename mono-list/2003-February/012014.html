<PRE>Rodrigo, the maintainer of libgda could speak more about the Oracle provider
in libgda.

As for the Oracle provider in Mono, it basically was just a start.  It can
only connect and
do very simple statements like INSERTs.  The Oracle provider is found in the
mcs source at
mcs/class/System.Data.OracleClient.  It uses the OCI (Oracle Call Interface)
shared library.
Because I could not figure out how to platform invoke via DllImport
attributes into oci properly, I decided to create a shared library written
in C.  This C library uses glib 2.0 and provides the glue between Oracle's
oci shared library and the managed System.Data.OracleClient.dll assembly.  I
have only tested it on Windows XP Professional using the Microsoft Visual
C++ command-line compiler.  There is a makefile for the Borland C++
command-line compiler which is a free download from <A HREF="http://www.borland.com/">http://www.borland.com/</A>
however, I have not tested it. I would have liked to do this on Linux with
gcc, but I don't have another machine to install both Linux and Oracle.

I haven't actually worked on the provider since the summer, but it
should be there.  It is possible that you are working with an older
version.  I'm not sure if the version of libgda which contains the
Oracle provider is available in Red Hat 8.  You might also need to
download a separate package to get the Oracle provider. I believe
this is the case on debian.

Check out <A HREF="http://www.gnome-db.org">http://www.gnome-db.org</A> for more information.

One thing you might find interesting is that Daniel Morgan
(<A HREF="mailto:danmorg@sc.rr.com">danmorg@sc.rr.com</A>) was working on a Mono Oracle provider.
I'm not sure how far along he got with it.  I would really
like to see that project succeed.  It uses the Oracle Call
Interface as a shared library, without using libgda at all.
We wish to implement the Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1
System.Data.OracleClient namespace at some point.

If you have any other questions, please feel free to send me more
mail.

Thanks,
