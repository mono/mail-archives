<PRE>Hello guys!

I read on your site that
&quot;MCS was able to parse itself on April 2001, MCS compiled itself for the
first time on December 28 2001. MCS became self hosting on January 3rd,
2002. 
&quot;
Forgive me please my ignorance but I just can't comprehend how bunch of
programming code (which is text) can compile itself? As far as I understand
one needs to have executable which is collection of pointers and op codes (
primitively saying) to at least be run by operation system. But how text
files can bootstrap themselves and turn themselves into executable code I
cannot understand. Could you explain this to me please. Is there anything
that I can read about it?

Thank you very much
Take Care

Olegh
