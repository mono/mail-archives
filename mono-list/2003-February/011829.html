No, it does not work for *everyone*.  In particular it does not work for Nick, whom Miguel kicked
off of mono-hackers at the same time and who has since stopped developing for mono completely, nor
does it work for me.

I have explained what is stopping me.  I have been excluded from mono-hackers because I was
'working with the competing project' which is a GNU/Free Software project the last time I checked.
 What exactly, 'working with the competing project' means has still not been explained.  Yes,
Miguel and Paolo have suggested that I was going to 'fork' System.Xml and Miguel accused me of
fostering animosity towards mono in a private email, but no one has explained what Nick's
transgression was, and Miguel has declined to specify what he considers a 'fork' of System.Xml nor
do I understand how he considers my suggestion for Portable.NET to use System.Xml as showing
'animosity' towards Mono. AFAIK, Nick had not submitted any patches towards Portable.NET nor had
he anything to do with System.Xml.
