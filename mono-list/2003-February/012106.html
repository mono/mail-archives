<PRE>Are there new features that are not covered by the standard provided to
ECMA, or is 1.1 a new version of the standard.=20

Personally, I though 1.1 was mostly a bug fix for Visual Studio .NET and
also to be more compliant with the standard. I didn't know they added
enough new features to be incompatible with 1.0.

I guess I should read on it more :)

Subject: [Mono-list] mono / .net framework 1.1 / roadmap

Hi,

Having just read the overview for  MS's .NET framework  1.1beta, I was
wondering what the Mono teams's position is regarding such further
technology developments like this.

I don't mean with regards to the specific new features like
System.Data.Oracle etc. but more in general, for example, whether the
development on a 1.0 mono will continue regardless of changes brought
about in 1.1 or if there is even a correlation here. Is there a roadmap
related to the development of mono in relation to the development of the
.NET framework in general?

I am also wondering to what extent people see this development as
another
MS attempt to keep things incompatitible. In particular, I am troubled
by
the following statement:

* If an application written with the .NET Framework 1.1 Beta is
installed
on a system with only the .NET Framework 1.0 Redistributable, it will
not
run (unless configured to do so).

(ref:<A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/productinfo/next/overview.as">http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/productinfo/next/overview.as</A>
p)

Am I reading too much into that statement? Probably... ;-) There is not
even a mention of mono - but to me it sounds like as soon as 1.1 gains
acceptance, any apps developed with it would no longer run with mono
(which would make sense, assuming they are using 1.1 specific features,
but not necessarily in general - although &quot;if configured to do so&quot; it
might work either way...).

I dunno... its all starting to get pretty confusing to me, what seemed
so simple and elegant at first... Interested in hearing all of your
feedback on the issue.

Best Regards,
--chris
