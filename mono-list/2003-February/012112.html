<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i>   i'd like to ask someone from Mono headquarter ;) to clear out
</I>&gt;<i> .Net patent issue. i've noticed that since info about Microsoft's
</I>&gt;<i> application showed up, mono-list and mono-cvs-list fell silent all
</I>&gt;<i> of the sudden. are the developers holding up their work?
</I>&gt;<i> i hope that i'm not nagging, but is there any (sub)official Ximian's
</I>&gt;<i> opinion on Mono's future? may we hear/read it?
</I>
This does not change our plans.  You can read the FAQ, and look at the
question of how we will deal with patents that can not be used by free
software.

I personally did not want to get involved with the debate, because most
of it was from miss-informed opinions.  The original ZDnet article ahs a
few quotes from people who looked at the caption and made a blank
statement, so there is nothing really new in the discussion.

Miguel.
