We should probably fix this in CVS.  Thanks,

Here's some history (as I understand it, and simplified).  In the
beginning was gtkhtml, which allowed editing HTML.  Then came gtkhtml-2
for the Gnome-2 platform, which provided CSS and DOM support, but didn't
allow editing (and is currently unmaintained, IIRC).

Evolution is built atop gtkhtml (the first version), and as part of the
Gnome 2 port they're porting gtkhtml to GTK+ 2.  This version is
libgtkhtml-3.

In short, libgtkhtml-3 is completely different from libgtkhtml-2, so
trying to use libgtkhtml-2 won't work.

You can get libgtkhtml-3 from the gnome CVS, in the gtkhtml module.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Could you tell me what is this file, where I could find it, etc ?.....
</I>
The file you're looking for is $prefix/etc/mono/config.  $prefix should
be /usr, but it has also been /usr/local in some of the previous
distributed builds.

However, trying to substitute libgtkhtml-3 with libgtkhtml-2 won't work,
as described above.

&gt;<i> 4].

</I>&gt;<i> where it put all default library (System.Drawing.dll, etc...), so you don't

</I>&gt;<i> What about mcs ? (it obvioulsy has one too) I mean, what's its name ? where is 
</I>&gt;<i> it ? could I also have one in my working directory, just like csc ?
</I>
Actually, I don't think mcs has this.  At least, it's not mentioned in
the man page.  It does support &quot;response files&quot;, which can contain
files/arguments.  These are specified with a leading @ on the command
line, e.g. mcs @response-file.txt
