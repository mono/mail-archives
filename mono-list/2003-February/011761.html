I am very aware that this is the solution you offer, but that does not answer 
the question ... _why_?  Why do you want a developer mailing list with only 
one subscriber while everyone else uses mono-hackers for development 
discussion?  Why not just create an *open* mono development mailing list 
which everyone can use to discuss mono's technical development and create a 
different mailing list for Ximian's secrets?  This way mono can be developed 
with the benefit of full community participation.

I see no reason why you continue to insist on combining a developer mailing 
list with a secret list where you discuss internal Ximian confidential 
information.  If mono is a community project, as opposed to a Ximian project 
with limited community participation, then this should be rectified.   

&gt;<i> &gt; You said you'd create the list when you returned from Mexico and when you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; didn't I asked and you gave this excuse.  Why can't you just set up a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; regular mailing list like all of the others.  As we discussed, you could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use mono-hackers/secrets for your confidential information and the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; development discussion could take place on an open mailing list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can use mono-cli-list, mono-classes, mono-gc, mono-winforms,
</I>&gt;<i> mono-sd-port and mono-docs-list to discuss a particular topic.
</I>
It is not a matter of what *I* use to discuss mono development if everyone 
else is using mono-hackers.  Why on earth would I want to join a mailing list 
where I am the only subscriber?
