apologies to the list.

The script you refer to worked fine for me under SuSE 9.3.  I'm not 
familiar with your distribution, but is it LSB compliant?  Does it have 
the same procedure for starting services as SuSE does?  I believe 
Robert's script is LSB-centric.  He will no doubt correct me if I'm wrong.

If I'm going in the right direction, then you may need to look at how 
your distribution goes about starting daemons at startup, and modify 
things in the script to suit.

If it's any help, I work by putting the calls to mono-service into an 
ordinary script and calling it manually (as it were) until it starts and 
stops the service correctly.  Then I copy it to the init.d directory and 
let the SuSE insserve command do its work.  However I believe that that 
command is specific to SuSE, so other distributions will vary.

If you want a more coherent description of what I did, go to 
<A HREF="http://www.peredur.uklinux.net/msc/">http://www.peredur.uklinux.net/msc/</A> and download the pdf file of my DS.  
I describe the process on page 54.  You won't want to read any more of 
it than that unless you suffer very badly from insomnia.

Again, apologies if this has all already been said.
