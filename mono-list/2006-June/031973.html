<PRE> 

Something else came to mind.  Do I need to give the executable file (on
linux) any other permission than execute (chmod +x my.exe) ???

I have re-written my prototype to use ansynchronous sockets instead of
TcpListener and still cannot get the socket server to run on linux (CentOS
4).  I have the firewall turned off for that computer as well.

I even tried running as a Console app and the socket server still will not
run. 

It can't be this difficult, LOL.

Thanks again for any help or advice.

Lee

</I>&gt;<i> I have had a bit of difficulty in implementing a socket 
</I>&gt;<i> server as a service application with mono and have been asked 
</I>&gt;<i> to enter a report in bugzilla which I have done.  Must I use 
</I>&gt;<i> a service application to have a program run at startup?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can a console app be made to start up automatically?  Does 
</I>&gt;<i> that even make sense to do?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I looked into using xinet.d but it seems that the line buffer 
</I>&gt;<i> is limited to
</I>&gt;<i> 255 bytes and I will be sending xml packets back and forth 
</I>&gt;<i> that will exceed that easily.
