Thank you for replying.  I should have been more specific..my apologies.  I
am coming from a Windows coding back ground (Delphi and recently C#/VS) and
I was wondering in that particular context, if there was anything that I
should be aware of.  I could have sworn I had mentioned that in my first
post although I obviously did not.  Again, sorry about that.

Actually, now that I think of it, there are some specific questions I'd like
to query as well:

1. Is there a command/class in mono that I can use to invoke specific
applications on the local linux box?  I only want to invoke specific
applications such as the sox app I referred to in my first post or restart
the linux box.  LOL, I will not be giving clients carte blanche on executing
*any* application on the linux box.

2. In copying or moving files in mono/linux, is it the same as with
.net/windows with the exception of the linux/windows differences in
specifying paths?

Thanks again,

Warm Regards,

Lee
