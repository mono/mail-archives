Thanks for your clarification in reply to my private request.

&gt;<i> No, I haven't asked him about that, neither I remember listening

If he want to join the community and talk for/with us, that's awesome.
But otherwise I don't think he is not part of the Mono Community in
the sense whether his blog should be aggregated on monologue or not.
As I wrote you privately there is no jutifying reason to expect the
community to have strong interest on Qt# as we (in this case Miguel)
had for Gimp#.

At least I wouldn't complain about having KDE guy on the blog roll
as long as it is appropriate.
