  Yes... I know... I found your post  ____after____ I posted my question.
BTW: do you know how to search the e-mail archive without scrolling
manually through the subjects ?

  Mono is trying to install SQLite v2.8 when other common
&gt;<i> packages are already up to v3.2.  I have no idea how people are installing
</I>&gt;<i> Mono on RHEL - certainly not from RPM, probably not from source, so is
</I>&gt;<i> anyone running over RHEL (CentOS, WhiteBox Linux, etc)?
</I>
   Very good question...   After my exercise in futility I seriously
doubt that mono
   runs on stock RHEL.
   NOTE:  I have to use RHEL (or CentOS as my sandbox) because the company,
               where I work, uses exclusively RHEL in production...
more than 400 servers
               and 150+  desktops. 'mono' developers should now that
industry does not
              move as fast as FC4/5 ...  We are a conservative bunch
of people. Before
              we jump, we re-thing 5 times. For example, we are still
using in some of our labs
              RH8 boxes   and we will continue to use them for, at
least, next 2-3 years.
              &lt;grin&gt; we will move our lab from RH8 to RHEL (CentOS
4.3) after the 'mono' issue
                         is ironed out ...  in other words.. when we
will have a compelling
                          reason to move&lt;\grin&gt;

The person who is
&gt;<i> doing the Mono builds for RH needs to test the RPM on a system with an
</I>&gt;<i> assortment of common packages, like any of us would, and he'll see that it
</I>&gt;<i> won't work.
</I>
   He/she should just install full CentOS 4.3  + ALL updates and then
install mono.
   It will not work.  'mono' guys should remove misleading info from their page
   CentOS 4.3 		
   Use the Red Hat Linux Enterprise 4.0 packages from go-mono

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The most helpful suggestion posted here was to use the Installer:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Downloads">http://www.mono-project.com/Downloads</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course someone else said that this was problematic as well.  I really
</I>&gt;<i> should just use that until the RPM issues are gone...
</I>
  Do you mean 'rug' ?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Last year I fell into RPM hell with Mono, trying to install from source and
</I>&gt;<i> getting tons of dependency issues with Monodevelop, Monodoc, and others.
</I>&gt;<i> After waiting a period for these issues to go away, I tried to install
</I>&gt;<i> v1.1.13 and had similar issues.  I haven't tried again since.  Outside of
</I>&gt;<i> trying to install once a year or so I don't know what else I can do here.
</I>
  I agree with you..   I will wait, at least 6-8 months before I try
to install it again.

&gt;<i> Project contributors, this isn't a complaint.  I really appreciate your
</I>&gt;<i> efforts and talk about the project forums, my blog, with colleagues, etc..
</I>&gt;<i> But basic install stuff like this needs to be fixed or the project can't
</I>&gt;<i> achieve &quot;critical mass&quot; as a compelling platform for development against
</I>&gt;<i> hand-coded PHP, Perl, Java, etc.
</I>
  I do agree with you 120% (or even more)

Regards

Igor
