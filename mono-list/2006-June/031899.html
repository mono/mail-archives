Sorry, let me clarify:

No, I haven't asked him about that, neither I remember listening 
anything from his side but, I was wondering that, as well as it was done 
with the Gimp# guy that I have mentioned, we could do the same proposal 
to Richard Dale. I haven't done it myself because I don't mantain 
Monologue or have any responsibility or power of decision about it. I 
was just suggesting.

Regards.
