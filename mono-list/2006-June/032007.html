<PRE>Hi!

Sorry for a spam-like nature of this message, but I'd like to let you know 
that NLog 1.0 RC1 is available for download.

This is the first version of NLog that fully support Mono (both 1.0 and 2.0 
profiles) and contains pieces of code specially optimized for running on 
Mono/Unix. The File target makes use of Mono.Posix to implement 
multiprocess-safe file append routines which lets you have high performance 
logging on Unix.

Development on Linux/Mono is also supported thanks to NAnt 0.85 and all unit 
tests are known to pass in such configuration.

I'd love to hear your comments.

Regards,

Jarek

NLog 1.0 Release Candidate 1 is available.

NLog is a .NET logging library designed with simplicity and flexibility in
mind. With NLog you can process diagnostic messages emitted from any .NET
language, augment them with contextual information, format them according to
your preference and send them to one or more targets.

The API (application programming interface) is similar to log4net, and the
configuration is very simple. NLog uses a routing table while log4net uses a
logger hierarchy with attachable appenders. This makes NLog's configuration
very easy to read and maintain.

The highlights of this release are:

* Completely rewritten tutorial featuring nice screenshots.
* Visual Studio 2005 Integration
* Ready-to-run example projects for VS2005.
* Optimized File target that can write to multiple files at once from
multiple processes while keeping the files open.
* Automatic archiving of log files (a.k.a. &quot;rolling file&quot; target)
* New WebService and CSVFile targets.
* Even more speed improvements in the non-logging area.
