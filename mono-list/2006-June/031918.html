The security issues on this one are, well, large. This is a 
classical example of the kind of server that is intrinsically 
easy to abuse, and in which any buffer overflows or other 
security-related bugs will be likely to be very easy to exploit.

If someone new to server programming had written something 
like this and wanted to run it on a server I was responsible 
for, the answer would be a flat no. 

Rather than writing something from scratch for the job, you'd
be far better trying to find something that is widely used 
and accepted and can do the job you're actually trying to 
accomplish. You haven't explained what this is, but if you 
do, someone on this list may well be able to point you to 
something appropriate.
