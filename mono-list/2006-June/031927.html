<PRE>Hi.

First of all, I'm new to Mono, and if my questions were answered before, 
please let me know (or point me to the right docs). I've been playing 
with private/shared assemblies and as the subject suggests, there are 
some things which are not absolutely clear to me, and it's not 
necessarily easy to find definitive answers (at least on Google).

First question is about specifying assembly locations with &lt;probing 
privatePath=...&gt; elements of the .config xml file. Is it supported on 
Mono? I think I've seen some patches implementing this feature, but it 
doesn't seem to work. Should I use a wrapper script and specify it using 
$MONO_PATH instead?

Next thing, redirecting assembly versions. When I create publisher 
assembly policy file and add it to the GAC, it works as expected, but 
it's a global solution affecting all apps using this particular assembly 
(and &lt;publisherPolicy apply=&quot;no&quot; /&gt; doesn't work for me too). Grepping 
trough mono installation directory shows, that it (bindingRedirect) is 
used maybe once in a config file, so it seems that local redirects 
settings (affecting only chosen apps) may not be supported, please 
correct me if I'm wrong.

I wouldn't have asked these questions, but the more I read about .Net, 
the more I'm amazed by the &quot;compatibility&quot; of Mono. These are my first 
(minor) &quot;problems&quot; during my examination of Mono, and it's worth to note 
that if not Mono I wouldn't probably even touch .Net technology :) - 
shortly speaking - thank you Mono guys (girls?) :)

Regards,
W.
