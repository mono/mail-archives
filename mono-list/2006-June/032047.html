<PRE>Igor, I reported the same issue to this forum with v1.1.13 on
13-march-2006.  Mono is trying to install SQLite v2.8 when other common
packages are already up to v3.2.  I have no idea how people are installing
Mono on RHEL - certainly not from RPM, probably not from source, so is
anyone running over RHEL (CentOS, WhiteBox Linux, etc)?  The person who is
doing the Mono builds for RH needs to test the RPM on a system with an
assortment of common packages, like any of us would, and he'll see that it
won't work.

The most helpful suggestion posted here was to use the Installer:
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Downloads">http://www.mono-project.com/Downloads</A>
Of course someone else said that this was problematic as well.  I really
should just use that until the RPM issues are gone...

Last year I fell into RPM hell with Mono, trying to install from source and
getting tons of dependency issues with Monodevelop, Monodoc, and others.
After waiting a period for these issues to go away, I tried to install
v1.1.13 and had similar issues.  I haven't tried again since.  Outside of
trying to install once a year or so I don't know what else I can do here.

Project contributors, this isn't a complaint.  I really appreciate your
efforts and talk about the project forums, my blog, with colleagues, etc..
But basic install stuff like this needs to be fixed or the project can't
achieve &quot;critical mass&quot; as a compelling platform for development against
hand-coded PHP, Perl, Java, etc.

Regards and Thanks,
Tony
