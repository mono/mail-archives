<PRE>Hey All,

I'm trying to make a case for using Mono for a new project coming up and was
hoping that this list could help me with that decision.  The situation we
are in is that we have a smallish development team with extensive experience
working .net with visual studio 2010.  We would like to develop a new high
availability web application using jQuery and jQueryUI within a MVC
framework while utilizing the development tools in visual studios.  We
currently have a web farm consisting of linux servers running apache (and
hosting some legacy products that can't get moved) and the shear cost of new
hardware plus Microsoft license fees for those webservers is forcing us to
search for another solution.   Here seemingly enters Mono.   Seems that mono
would be a great fit since we could use mono-tools assist in the development
in VS2010, as well as using the VS2010 debugging tools and then deploy to
our current apache server farm updated to run mod_mono.   There is a bit of
hesitation however involved with some parties that mono will not provide the
speed/reliability of a fully native windows solution.  Do people think
running mono in this configuration would be reasonable close to running IIS
when considering speed and reliability?  In addition if we are using the
mono tools migration analysis can we be pretty confident that deployment
will be fairly free of compatibility issues?  

Any thoughts?

Thanks for you assistance
