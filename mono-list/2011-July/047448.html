<PRE>Hi,

On a number of recent projects I have made use of Mono and Linux for hosting ASP.NET MVC 3 projects. I found overall the option to work well, however there does exist a number of potential pitfalls, mainly around the database and ORM solutions. If you are serious about using Mono, then you should enforce the use of an open source solution for your ORM and you should think very hard about which database you want to make use of. I found that many of the &quot;commercial&quot; .NET Drivers either do not work or half work under Mono, and generally this is due to the way the driver has been written, not the Mono implementation. So when selecting a database, think about using MySQL or PostgreSQL, or potentially look at the NoSQL options such as MongoDB and Redis. The fact the drivers are open source gives you great flexibility when it comes to potentially having to fix the driver when used under Mono. Although I have used all 4 of these with great success under Mono.

Regards
Matthew Winter
