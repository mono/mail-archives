I would expect Xamarin to have a pretty positive influence across the board.
Consider a few things:

1) The Xamarin guys are very pro-Open Source and open as much as is
practical within their business model. This is the basis for the rest of my
commentary.

2) The core Mono platform (including the GC and framework) are the base for
both MonoTouch and Mono for Android. I would expect to Xamarin to focus on
these pretty heavily.

3) I assume that Linux remains the primary development platform for Mono.
Linux support will most likely be strongest of any platform.

4) The support for OS X and iOS are quite tightly linked. You need to run
MonoDevelop on Mac OS X in order to use MonoTouch. It would expect the
support for Mac OS X to improve over time to about the same level as Linux.
MonoMac and MonoTouch share a bunch of code. The evolution of MonoTouch will
benefit MonoMac as well although we need more than just Xamarin to keep that
going.

5) Xamarin has also taken on responsibility for supporting the SUSE
Enterprise Mono products. Again, this means that Linux support has to stay
strong but I would also expect that a great number of these customers are
running ASP.NET. So, I would expect strong support to continue in this area
as well.

There has been very little change to the commercial interests of the Mono
core team. Although Xamarin does not have the resources that Novell did,
they do not have the corporate culture to fight either. There is not much
reason to assume that the Xamarin Mono guys will behave much differently
than they did before.

I am really looking forward to Xamarin being a great success and to seeing
what these guys can do when money stops being such an immediate issue.
