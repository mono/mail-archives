<PRE>Can you include the old and ancient releases of mono too?

Case for keeping old releases:

Just last night I could not figure out to get jay to work for me in a mono-2.10.2 release.&#160; I was trying to build your csharp and Mono-CSharp without using mono's build system.&#160; So, I found an ancient release of mcs 0.12 tarball and used it to figure out how to use jay correctly.&#160; The older releases of mono/mcs tarballs were simple compared to the complex build rules that we have now.&#160; Unzips faster too.

Subject: [Mono-list] Mono Project: Next Steps


Hello folks,

&#160;&#160;&#160;Some of you have been asking about the upcoming release of Mono 2.12.

&#160;&#160;&#160;We hit a little bit of a bump in the road with the layoff of the Mono team, but we have now re-constituted the team at Xamarin and we are getting back to speed. &#160;Our first priority at Xamarin is to ensure that our amazing team of hackers remains employed, so we are focused on creating amazing products for the mobile space. &#160;&#160;Of course, our products are entirely based on Mono, and as you can see from the commits to the various Mono modules, a lot of our energy goes into improving Mono.

&#160;&#160;&#160;To get the 2.12 release to your hands, here&#8217;s what we still need to do:

(a) We need to be able to build packages
(b) We need to be able to host the software
(c) We need to adopt the branching and release procedures.

&#160;&#160;&#160;During the transition to Xamarin, we lost our build engineer. But luckily at Xamarin we&#8217;ve hired Alex Corrado, a very talented developer who&#8217;s created a new build system for Mono. &#160;The good news is that we are making progress and we are now able to build Linux and MacOS packages. &#160;&#160;Next, Alex is working on Windows builds. &#160;We are not there yet, but we will be there in the next couple of weeks.

&#160;&#160;&#160;Once we have packages, we will setup a new website for the Mono project where we can host the software and the other project resources, like a wiki, forums, etc. &#160;So we are working on a separate domain to host both a Mono web site and the software, and that should be up in the next week or two.

&#160;&#160;&#160;Once we have something ready, we will share the information with the rest of the world and give access to the new Wiki to the various maintainers to help us keep the content up to date. 

Thank you for your patience and your love for Mono!

Miguel
