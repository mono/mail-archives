How old is the hardware of the web farm? What Linux version/distro
does it run?

Yes, but it takes more attention and an experienced development
team, IMO. Sloppy programming (inducing GC pressure etc.) is
rather disadvantageous. Lack of unit and load tests is a no-go.
Using the latest and greatest APIs from Redmond isn't a good
idea, too.

Also, a load balancer able to fade out machines running amok
is indispensable.

&gt;<i>  In addition if we are using the
</I>&gt;<i> mono tools migration analysis can we be pretty confident that deployment

</I>
No. MoMA is only able to detect APIs that (1) don't exist in
Mono, (2) are not implemented in Mono or (3) have know
issues under Mono. The latter usually does not include known
bugs. Only limitations like &quot;always return false&quot; and such.
