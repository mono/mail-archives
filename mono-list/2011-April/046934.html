<PRE>There appears to be an issue compiling with the latest Cygwin 1.7.9 on XP
SP3.

I have succussfully been compiling Mono in 64 bit Win7/Win2k8R2 environments
for Win32, however I want to setup a VM to share with other members of my
team to compile on their own. 

I figured the best choice would be Windows XP SP3 which is only 32 bit and
doesn't install any version of .Net. However Cygwin 1.7.9 combined with XP
and the way the autogen script runs that somehow is using Windows paths even
though I have no windows paths setup in the cygwin environment and I don't
any to autgen.  I use UNIX stile everywhere and I am doing everything
exactly the same as my successful cygwin environment on Win7/2k8R2.

Not sure where in this combination that is making the autogen script find
the dos paths which appear to break the make script from being able to
compile mono.

Looks like I will be forced to use a Win7 32 bit VM environment to do this
which is sad as it will install .Net into this environment which to prevents
me having a pure Mono environment on Windows. Which if I want to use
MonoDevelop on Windows already does since it requires .Net 4 and GTK# for
.Net.  This is not a good sign to me personally.
