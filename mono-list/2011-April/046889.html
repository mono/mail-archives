<PRE>I would like to know how does the Mono Project build their Win32 exe?  For
example&quot;

    mono-2.10.1-gtksharp-2.12.10-win32-2.exe

Is this process documented and the tools/code required to do it in the GIT
repo?

Is it a native Windows compile using Microsoft C compiler, Cygwin or is it a
cross-compile done on Linux?

They provide a VMWare image of OpenSUSE that has 2.10 pre-installed on it,
what are the chances of them providing a VMWare image of OpenSUSE that can
is pre-configured to build at least the Cross-Compile of Mono for Windows?  

It seems very nearly impossible to get a Windows build from the latest GIT
source, or any of the posted daily source drops. We want to verify bug fixes
that make it into the latest code base but unless we can build it for
Windows we cannot verify they are really fixed. We are reporting bugs and we
are very happy that many get quick response and some are even getting fixed
quickly.  However we would love to verify this in the environment we found
the bug in but without a Windows build we would have to wait for an official
next release which could take for ever.

It seems like the Linux build seems to always work out of the box from a
source drop or a GIT clone.  However it feels like Windows gets little to no
attention. I mean when is the windows version tested only when they have an
official build? Then this is when all the scripts and VS solution is fixed?

I mean the VS2010 project seems to always be broken in the GIT repo since
things get moved around, and even after fixing the new location for the
include files, you get down to glib.h having defines that cannot be resolved
and there appears to be a missing header file from GIT as all the ones
accounted for do not have the missing defines. So this stops that process.

The cross compile for windows as documented doesn't seem to work with a GIT
clone or a source drop.

Compiling for windows within cygwin doesn't even work.

Can anyone get a full Windows compile of Mono for the latest in GIT
preferably on Windows without Cygwin, or at least a cross-compile on
openSUSE? If so can you post a link to working documentation on how to do
this against GIT?
