<PRE>Robert,

I installed the gcc-g++: C++ compiler when I setup cygwin as I hate figured
one it couldn't hurt, and two it may be needed.

I was really tired when that error hit, so I just posted and went to bed.

So with fresh eyes I went back this morning and did what I should do when
this happens and look in the config.log. There I found the error behind the
failure, looks like it is failing on the &quot;-mno-cygwin&quot; flag with &quot;gcc:
installation problem, cannot exec 'cc1': No such file or directory&quot;. It is
trying to use cc1.exe from mingw32 core. I checked and it was installed with
gcc as it should be but the symlinks where not setup correctly to point to
the core gcc ones.

I attempted a reinstall of this lib but it doesn't change the file.  I also
manually ran the preremove and post install scripts the but didn't fix them. 
So there is an install issue with Cygwin and this library, that is an issue
I will take up with Cygwin later. 

So moving on, there are also 3 other files that have the same zero size and
no attributes (cc1obj.exe, cc1plus.exe, f771.exe).  So I removed the
symlinks for all four of them and recreated them and that got me past this
roadblock. 

So far the autogen is running strong and I hope things continue well.

Thanks for your help Robert. I will post a new thread if I hit another
roadblock I can't figure out.
