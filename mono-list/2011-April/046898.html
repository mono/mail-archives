Maybe. :-)

See below.

No, but it's fairly straight forward to create such a package for bundling purposes if you need to.

There are basically two ways to go for bundling purposes:

 1. Distribute ~all of Mono
 2. Distribute a mkbundled app.

In both cases you need to know the target ABI: there's no way to create a single program that will run on Linux, OSX, and Windows, though you could provide Mono's for all three (plus relevant CPU architectures).

For the &quot;Distribute ~all of Mono&quot; case, the use case would be a Windows &quot;run-from-CD&quot; style deployment: you would just copy the Mono runtime (mono, libmono.dll, GAC, etc.) onto your CD along with the app you want to install, then use a AUTORUN.INI file which will launch the app bundled on the CD with the mono bundled on the CD. The basic pattern here scales reasonably well -- just manually copy the mono, native libraries, and required assemblies onto some deployable media and use e.g. a script to actually launch the app with the bundled mono.

The &quot;mkbundled app&quot; approach involves using mkbundle(1) to bundle all necessary assemblies into a single file (optionally including the runtime), so that you only need to distribute a single file (plus any required native libraries) to run your app.

Be forewarned, though, that for public distributions you will need to follow the LGPL.
