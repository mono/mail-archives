<PRE>Greetings,

I am attempting to cross-compile for windows on OpenSUSE 11.4.  I have what
I believe are there required dependencies installed in the expected
locations for example &quot;/opt/cross/i386-mingw32msvc/&quot;.  I am working of the
latest in the GIT repo as of this e-mail.  The normal Linux make works.

The build-mingw32.sh script runs for a few minutes, and then exits with the
following error:

    configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
    See `config.log' for more details

I tried looking at the config.log but I cannot find anything. I am not a
Linux expert and can get around when I need to, but admittedly I am not the
best at compiling windows on Linux.

My goal is to get a 32 bit and 64 bit Windows build of the latest mono
(2.11.x) I tried cygwin and couldn't get that to work at all, tried the
VS2010 solution in the source and that is broken.  So I figured to use the
method that is most likely what is used by the Mono group when they do it. 
So I get a lot farther but still I am having trouble. 

I have attached the config.log in case it can help.  Any assistance on how
to get the latest mono to compile for 32 and 64 bit Windows either in Linux
or Windows would be appreciated.  There are bug fixes that have come in that
we really need to get a hold of.

config.log.bz2 

Best Regards,
