<PRE>I think you could get some help if you provide more information about your
situation and the problem.  For example...

What version of Mono are you using?
What OS are you running on?
How are you starting the app? (Double clicking, shell, etc / if shell
provide the command and params using)
Is this your project that you control, an open source one, or something out
of your control? (If public can you provide a link to it?)

With what little that is provided at this time, the only suggestions I can
suggest you look at and try are the following:

1) Have you checked it's app.config settings to see if it has a startup
section and if so what its supportedRuntime is set to?  

    If it has this section, have you tried commenting out the
supportedRuntime section before running?

2) It couldn't hurt to run the version that works on Windows through the
Mono Migration Analyzer (MoMA) has it may be doing something that is not
supported by Mono at this time.
