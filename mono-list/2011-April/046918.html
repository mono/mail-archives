<PRE>I finally was able to get a Win32 compile to finish with help from Robert
Jordan and this link:

<A HREF="http://shana.worldofcoding.com/en/mono_cygwin_tutorial.html">http://shana.worldofcoding.com/en/mono_cygwin_tutorial.html</A>

Full thread is here: <A HREF="http://go-mono.com/forums/#nabble-td3471123">http://go-mono.com/forums/#nabble-td3471123</A>

So now my new problem is this is not a full build of mono. So one example is
what I get will run some of our already compiled code, but I can't compile
the code using the 2.11 output. When I compare the files that are in the
2.10 releases with what is output by the Cygwin compile using the Shana
instructions there are a lot of things missing.  This could be because the
Shana instructions are based on Mono 1.2 and we are now at 2.11, so it could
be missing some required libraries to be installed on Cygwin to get it to be
detected by the autogen so it will compile the extra stuff.

So can someone review the Shana instructions and let me know what is missing
from them that would give me the same Win32 output matching the release
output in 2.10 (mono-2.10.2-gtksharp-2.12.10-win32-5.exe)?
