<PRE>While attempting to make mono from GIT I got this error:

     gunicode.c:234: error: `ENOTSUP' undeclared (first use in this
function)

I Google and nothing about gunicode.c and ENOTSUP.

I pulled late Saturday night.

I am on Windows 2008 R2 SP1 x64, using MinGW/MSys to compile Win32 with GCC
3.4.5.  I tried to use Cygwin but Autogen.sh can't generate with out errors
and there is another thread about that I had going. It looks like after
everything I will have to uninstall and reinstall and make sure GCC 4
doesn't get on, because even with alias' it seems to keep trying to use
gcc-4 instead of gcc-3 even when gcc is running. Anyway so I moved to MinGW
and MSys and I then only have gcc 3 installed.  

Is the latest broken?

I have been trying to compile the latest from source for Win32 since Monday
and it just doesn't work. Tried Visual Studio 2010 Solution, Cross-compile
for Windows on OpenSUSE, Cygwin, MinGW/MSys and even after I fix all the
environment, tool/command versions, and resource location issues I seem to
always end up with some stupid undefined or undeclared &quot;something&quot; in a C
file. The only compile that always seems to work is compiling for Linux on
OpenSUSE.  It seems all forms options for compiling Win32 are broken or way
to fragile.  This is very frustrating!
