<PRE>Hi all,

I'd like to introduce GameStack, an open-source toolkit for Mono and
Xamarin.iOS/Android. GameStack is for building games, interactive displays
and visualization components. It pulls together a number of open source
libraries into one package and adds its own facilities. GameStack was
originally an internal toolkit, but was recently open sourced and made
available on GitHub by my employer. We use Mono and Xamarin heavily in our
work, and GameStack is the result of a series of increasingly advanced
projects. It's been used to build data visualization components with
Xamarin, and on NUCs/embedded PCs with Mono to drive huge interactive touch
displays.

Project repo: <A HREF="https://github.com/icmus/GameStack">https://github.com/icmus/GameStack</A>

Project wiki: <A HREF="http://gamestack.wiki">http://gamestack.wiki</A>

Unfortunately, most of GameStack's projects were for clients, so I don't
have permission to share those. There's a silly little game included among
the samples, but we're on the lookout for something more robust to show off
with. At least one iPad game will be launching within the next week or two,
so we'll add some good screenshots from that.

The top question is likely to be: how is GameStack different from MonoGame?
GameStack departs significantly from the XNA API; portability for existing
apps wasn't a priority in our case. We desired a high degree of control
over the API, feature set and pipeline, and we used real-world projects to
help shape it. We don't currently have ambitions to support all the
platforms that MonoGame does.

I'm just dipping my toes in the water here, gauging community interest.
Your thoughts are welcome!

- Brett
