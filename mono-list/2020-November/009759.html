Thanks guys. I will define &quot;daemons&quot; a bit more.

What I want is a program listening on a port, just like FTP or maybe an =
instant messaging bot based on Alice (www.alicebot.org). Since I don't =
know any C or C++ I would want to do it in C#, or else I have to forget =
the whole idea.

So to start off, I need to know if it is possible and next, I would go =
to figure out how to write daemons in general.

There is actually no documentation to find on the internet about writing =
daemons or how to set them up to run in the background. Maybe I just =
look for the wrong keywords, or google is playing games with me =3D )

And yes, writing a service/daemon once might become easier to have it =
both on windows and on unix/linux.

So there is no &quot;need&quot; for C# doing daemons, but in my case it might =
become helpfull. C and C++ will still be very good languages for that, I =
know. But in general I was just curious how to built them and set them =
up, and I would do it in C#.

I hope it is more clear now.....

Regards,

Aschwin
