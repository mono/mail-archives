&gt;<i>Hello,
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> The really cool thing would be if you or someone else implemented the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> service-stuff from windows for mono and then you could use that.
</I>
&gt;<i>Yes, we do need in fact someone with Windows experience to actually
</I>&gt;<i>implement the Windows versions of those classes.  The Unix case should
</I>&gt;<i>be relatively trivial.
</I>
&gt;<i>Paolo has expressed his interest in the past in having a Mono.Posix.dll
</I>&gt;<i>which would provide us with direct access to the Unix API, raw, without
</I>&gt;<i>the .NET framework wrapping.  Together with some utility classes and
</I>&gt;<i>functions
</I>
Ok, now it is clear that writing daemons like in Windows can not be done =
yet on the Linux platform. Since those classes are not yet implemented.

First I would be very honoured to do that, but I really can't. Hacking =
in C# is a thing to learn and as a purpose I choose the Linux platform =
to combine both to learn from each end. Doing such I also wanted to know =
how to write daemons, and since hacking away on something that would be =
a nice goal to reach for myself. I know that I aim to high sometimes.

BUT.... I am not a very experienced programmer and above that I know =
very little about hacking classes for perticular OSes. So, I think it is =
not a good idea to have myself started on this and get lost or =
desinterested. Going by little steps works for me and having a lot of =
patience is what I have to learn. And I'm willing to learn how to =
program stuff for Linux, but I am very novice on it. Got my box Linux =
configured in february for the first time so....... =3D )

So, I will wait (with respect though) till somebody else will have the =
need or the urge to build those classes.

Along the side of this list I will learn quite enough and maybe in the =
future I will add my two cents to the project.

Thanks again and I will see how it will develop itself (no not =
automatically like AI, I mean the project =3D ))
