All,

Here is a .pkg installer for Mono 0.29:  
<A HREF="http://www.morford.org/mono/mono-0.29.pkg.zip">http://www.morford.org/mono/mono-0.29.pkg.zip</A>

A couple things:

1. Built with GCC 3.3 on Panther 10.3.1 with DarwinPorts using glib  
2.2.4 and dependents and pkgconfig 0.15. The BSD Subsystem is required,  
which is installed by default in 10.3.

2. The default install path for the .pkg is /usr/local. You can install  
the files anywhere you want by choosing to customize the install path.  
You can also &quot;Show Package Contents&quot;  from Finder and go into the  
Contents folder and grab the .gz of the files.

3. You'll need glib2 and dependents installed, either from DarwinPorts  
or Fink. The DPorts Portfile for glib2 contains a fairly readable  
listing of the glib2 dependencies:

<A HREF="http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/darwinports/dports/devel/glib2/">http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/darwinports/dports/devel/glib2/</A> 
Portfile

4. If anyone has hosting space for this installer, perhaps on  
go-mono.com or opendarwin.org, please let me know.

5. The JIT Engine for PPC is definitely coming along and on that  
congrats! mint works really well now and I've not encountered any  
issues yet compiling and running small to medium size assemblies with  
it. I've not had time to test on Darwin 7 on x86.

6. I've got a PortFile almost working for 0.29 and I had GTK# 0.14  
working through X11 for a very very very simple test but I'll  
definitely need more time to work out a PortFile for that and, with  
mint, it runs slow. Like Markus I think the PPC JIT should be closer to  
complete before committing it into DPorts but perhaps as a development  
port or with an unstable marker.

7. No GC. :( I'd like to be able to figure this out and see if it is  
even a problem now on 10.3. A good overview of all the new capabilities  
in OS X v.3, including commands and libs from FreeBSD 5, GCC 3.3,  
pthread signaling, I/O, aio_* updates, System V poll system calls and  
more of the many updates, additions and changes can be found at the  
following:

<A HREF="http://www.apple.com/macosx/pdf/Panther_Unix_TB_10082003.pdf">http://www.apple.com/macosx/pdf/Panther_Unix_TB_10082003.pdf</A>
<A HREF="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/unix/">http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/unix/</A>


I would like to work out providing a &quot;Mono.framework&quot; for OS X. If  
anyone is interested in kicking off a Mono OS X hacking subproject to  
provide goodies like Xcode project templates, a Mono.framework bundle,  
PKG/DMG installers and Cocoa and other framework interop layer  
assemblies, send me mail so we can discuss needs, goals, a roadmap and  
project space and setup a mail list. We would hackers of all types,  
*NIX, Mac, .NET, etc so we can cover all the technical bases.


Have Fun!
