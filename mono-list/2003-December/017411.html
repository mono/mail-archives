<PRE>&gt;<i> One of the most impressive things I remember about Ben was how fast he 
</I>&gt;<i> did some xslt implementations. In the go-mono site there is a news about 
</I>&gt;<i> Ben starting the implementation and another news (11 days later) talking 
</I>&gt;<i> about Ben already have it implemented!! It was pretty fast! :)
</I>
I am always glad to tell my friends that there is a super hacker high 
school student who implemented the core of XSL transformation engine 
within 2 months in our project (however, most of them are not 
CS/engineer people and they cannot understand. When I knew he really 
started managed XSLT implementation, I let the typhoon to build away 
core working engine. When I came back to XSLT, I needed not a few days 
to understand the code, since he has really finished almost all the 
works. Also thanks to his excellent works, I could concentrate on other 
missing XML stuff e.g. xml schema.

Along the way, he did not only implement the core engine, but also has 
concrete plans to let this scheme on schedule, cut required job pieces 
and let hackers to cope with them. He also implemented monologue, 
improved monodoc, and hacked around several stuff in this season.

Oh, and don't forget that Miguel's has already entered XSLT story ;)
