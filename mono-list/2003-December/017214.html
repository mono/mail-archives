<PRE>Carlos,
   I am using  SslClientStream class in my client program to talk to an =
LDAP server over SSL. But the handshake is not completing properly and the =
client hangs in between. I wrote the following lines of code to do this:-

                                            //certfile is a ASN1 DER =
encoded selfsigned certificate file.
                                                X509Certificate Cert =3D =
X509Certificate.CreateFromCertFile(certfile);
                                                Socket sock =3D   new =
Socket (        AddressFamily.InterNetwork,
                                                                           =
                           SocketType.Stream,        ProtocolType.IP);
                                                IPAddress hostadd =3D =
Dns.Resolve(host).AddressList[0];
                                                IPEndPoint ephost =3D new =
IPEndPoint(hostadd,port);
                                                sock.Connect(ephost);
                                                NetworkStream nstream =3D =
new NetworkStream(sock,true);
                                                SslClientStream sslstream =
=3D new SslClientStream(        nstream,        host,        true,         =
                     =20
                                                                           =
                                            Mono.Security.Protocol.Tls.Secu=
rityProtocolType.Default,
                                                                           =
                                           new X509CertificateCollection(ne=
w X509Certificate[]{Cert}));
                                              System.IO.Stream input=3D =
sslstream;
                                              System.IO.Stream output=3Dssl=
stream;

I am using input and output stream to read and write on the socket. The =
certificate looks like okay since i have used the same certificate to talk =
to the ldap server over ssl using Openssl libraries.

Here is a log from the server which may give you some clue of what is =
happening on the server side:-


LDAP    : Monitor 0x508 received signal l
LDAP    : Monitor 0x508 initiating TLS handshake on connection 0x9176cc0
LDAP    : (164.99.145.182:51124)(0x0000:0x02) DoTLSHandshake on connection =
0x9176cc0
LDAP    : (164.99.145.182:51124)(0x0000:0x02) Connection 0x9176cc0 sending =
read blocked signal r to monitor 0x508
LDAP    : Monitor 0x508 received signal r
LDAP    : Monitor 0x508 signaling read blocked connection 0x9176cc0

read blocked signal r to monitor 0x508
LDAP    : Monitor 0x508 received signal r


In case of OpenSSL library ( When the handshake completes properly ) =
following log is generated:-

LDAP    : New TLS connection 0x9176cc0 from 164.99.159.221:2943, monitor =
=3D 0x508, index =3D 1

0x9176cc0
LDAP    : Monitor 0x508 received signal l

LDAP    : (164.99.159.221:2943)(0x0000:0x02) DoTLSHandshake on connection =
0x9176cc0
LDAP    : (164.99.159.221:2943)(0x0000:0x02) Connection 0x9176cc0 sending =
read blocked signal r to monitor 0x508
LDAP    : Monitor 0x508 received signal r
LDAP    : Monitor 0x508 signaling read blocked connection 0x9176cc0
LDAP    : (164.99.159.221:2943)(0x0000:0x02) Completed TLS handshake on =
connection 0x9176cc0
LDAP    : (164.99.159.221:2943)(0x0000:0x02) Connection 0x9176cc0 sending =
handshake signal h to monitor 0x508
LDAP    : Monitor 0x508 received signal h


Do you have any idea of what might be the cause of problem?

Sunil.

Hello:

 &gt;   I was trying to use some  of the classes provided in
 &gt;Mono.Security.Protocol.Tls like TlsSocket,TlsSession etc.

I have removed it two weeks ago, and replaced it with an SslClientStream=20=

implementation similar to the existent in the .NET 1.2 documentation.

 &gt;Can anyone tell me about the status of these classes.

They are under development, and at this moment they have some limitations:

	- Client only.

	- No real server certificate validation (only the 	certificate=
 date and=20
target host are validated now).

	- No client authentication.

The supported Cipher Suites for TLS protocol are:

	- TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA

	- TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA

	- TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA

	- TLS_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA

	- TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA

	- TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5
	=09

And for SSL3 are:

	- SSL_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA

	- SSL_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA

	- SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA

	- SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5			=09

I was busy this week and have no time for work on it but i have plans=20
for restart the work next week.

 &gt;BTW I was looking for a way to create SSL/TLS socket, Is there &gt;any=20
other way thru which I can do without using TlsSocket &gt;class?

You can use the Mono.Security.SslClientStream class for it.

An example on how to setup it:

string targetHost =3D &quot;localhost&quot;;

IPAddress hostadd =3D Dns.Resolve(&quot;localhost&quot;).AddressList[0];

IPEndPoint EPhost =3D new IPEndPoint(hostadd, 443);

Socket socket =3D new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork,
				SocketType.Stream,
				ProtocolType.IP);

// Make the socket to connect to the Server
socket.Connect(EPhost);				=09

// Create a Network Stream that owns the socket
NetworkStream networkStream =3D new NetworkStream(socket, true);

// Create a new SslClientStream instance that owns the
// networkStream
SslClientStream sslStream =3D new SslClientStream(
		networkStream,							=
	targetHost,
		true,								=
	SecurityProtocolType.Default);


With SecurityProtocolType.Default the SslClientStream will use TLS as=20
security protocol, the handshake will be negotiated in the first=20
read/write operation.
