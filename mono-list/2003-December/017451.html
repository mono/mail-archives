<PRE>Hi there,

I've created a Gtk-Sharp template project called SharpDhcpdConf. This
project is, of course, unfinished but it's auto* scripts are +- okay
(they work).

I am now planning to create a similar template webproject. I do
understand that the Visual Studio.NET and other .NET freaks will respond
with phrases like:

&quot;Xcopy deployment your dork!!&quot;

And my response is:
Yeah yeah sure, but I want to do both development and deployment on a
Linux computer. So I don't have VS.NET to compile the webproject for me.
(Well, I have it but I don't want to use it).

Since I don't know to much about Nant I decided to use auto* for the
build procedure (it is, however, highly unfinished a.t.m.).

I kindly invite everybody who is interested in this template to
contribute idea's, fixes or patches so that sooner or later we have a
template webproject that is actually usable like:

We fetch a copy of the template, rename 4 things, start developing the
webproject, we commit a first version .. and we can deploy, compile and
develop it on both a xsp (Linux) and a IIS (Windows) ASP.NET server
without any problems at all.

Note that I am _not_ interested in VS.NET. I want to develop on Linux,
period and end of discussion :). Really, I do, yes really.. so don't
tell me that developing on VS.NET and doing a xcopy deployment to a
Linux server is better and/or more easy: I already know that and thats
not the point here. The point is that I want to enable my Linux desktop
for ASP.NET webdevelopment :-).
