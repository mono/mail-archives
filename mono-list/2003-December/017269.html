I had missed the --profile option on the mono help. Anyway, I think I am
trying to use the profiler for the wrong sort of thing. The test code I
ran was so short that it was faster in mint than mono anyway (about
170ms rather than 260ms). When I actually care about performance I might
look into how one should go about it.

Incidently is there a list of stupid things that you shouldn't do for
performance? Or some rules for which operations are expensive? How does 
&quot;is&quot; compare in speed to actually calling a virtual method on the type
for example, or should I go and experiment for myself? Basically I don't
want to be writing big slow code just because I don't understand C# as
much as I do C or similar.
