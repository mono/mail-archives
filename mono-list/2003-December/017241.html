<PRE>I've deployed the DotNetNuke portal in recent months, and the users have
been extremely pleased. DNN is an enhanced rewrite of IBuySpy ASP.Net
portal, unfortunately derived from the VB.NET version instead of C#. There
is an active market in useful third party components, which makes a
transition to C# unlikely for the DNN community. Some third party
components are available only as compiled private assemblies, but
fortunately source is available for DNN and most third party components.

For all its utility and favor with my users, DNN is unfortunately tying me
to running at least one Windows/SQL server for the foreseeable future.
Other than DNN, I have everything running on Linux.

What are the prospects for either:

a) mono's VB.NET compiler coming up to the point where it can compile a
comprehensive ASP.Net app like DNN, or

b) running the windows-compiled DNN and third party components on mono
irrespective of the source language? I know this should work, but does it
in practice?

Also, have any of the postgres/mysql provider projects implemented
anything that would help .Net apps that presume SQL server to work with
alternative databases using impersonated library names? Obviously there
would be issues with SQL differences, etc.

Thanks.
