<PRE>Wonderful, can't wait!

Also, if you have a few moments at some point, I would LOVE to learn how you
do it so I can keep up with the current developments in mono.  I've spent
the last 4 days trying to get it to compile under cygwin and have had
nothing bu dismal failure after dismal failure  :)

Yeah, there is one very specific reason: I have been really busy at
school lately, and haven't had time to do a build.

I have a final in the morning and will be free until Wednesday morning,
so I'll try to make a build then.

Duncan.
