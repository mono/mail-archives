Merry Christmas!

Great!! Thanks for the gift :)

Woow! Very nice to know how things get started. :)

One of the most impressive things I remember about Ben was how fast he 
did some xslt implementations. In the go-mono site there is a news about 
Ben starting the implementation and another news (11 days later) talking 
about Ben already have it implemented!! It was pretty fast! :)

Congratulations all for this nice work!
