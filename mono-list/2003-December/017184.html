<PRE>Hello!

I would like to hear suggestions on how to handle this:

I've set up a Linux box running XSP. I would like to enable each user to 
have his own public_html directory in his home, and that directory would 
be published as &quot;<A HREF="http://domain/user".">http://domain/user&quot;.</A> Right now, I have placed symbolic 
links inside the XSP root directory, to the public_html directories. It 
is working for a first try, but as I'm running XSP with root privileges, 
the users have root privileges and then there is no security.

So my two questions:

1) Is there an easy way to avoid the security problem?
2) Wouldn't it be much better to create an application for each user, or 
even allow the users to create their own applications? This would be 
great to provide &quot;XSP web hosting&quot;. :-) Yesterday I asked this on IRC 
and there was some discussion on the possibility of adding applications 
to the XSP server without restarting it. Any thoughts? Maybe, if I use 
an Apache web server with mod_mono, would this be handled easier?

My machine is cesar.epac.to and if anyone wants to do any tests, feel 
free to ask me for an account.

Thank you a lot for the attention!

Best regards,
Cesar
