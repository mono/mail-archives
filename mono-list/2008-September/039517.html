<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I use openSuSE Linux, and found it encouraging that SuSE is the only 
</I>&gt;<i> Linux supported by Server 2008 Hyper-V virtualization.  Not the only 
</I>&gt;<i> Linux that will work with it, of course, but the only one officially 
</I>&gt;<i> SUPPORTED by Microsoft.
</I>
And fearing the start of another war of words, this too me, is reason
enough not to use SuSE. Full stop. I never trust the borg, they have a
wonderful past record in divide and conquer and as far as their patent
deal with Novell goes, I trust it as much as I trust Darl McBride or
David Miscavaige to tell the truth over SCOsource or $cientology noth
being a cult. But enough of politics, get in bed with the devil and you
end up with a very sore backside!

&gt;<i> Others, who have personally adopted Red Hat, or Ubuntu, will of course, 
</I>&gt;<i> disagree.
</I>
I've used just about every distro out there, but have always relied on
RedHat since pre-version 1. Fedora is rock solid and I know personally
(as I do the packaging for it) that the mono stack is as up to date as
it goes.

I guess it's horses for courses. Fedora is a cracking distro with a long
heritage of quality (in terms of backing and development). Ubuntu has
come on in leaps and bounds, Debian is based too far in the past (again,
IMHO, though it is cited as being the reason why Win98 was given an
extended lease of life), Mandriva is fun, but there is something I'm not
comfortable with, but can't quite put my finger on why!

TTFN

Paul
