<PRE>One thing to note:

Not everyone has time to contribute to an open source project to fix their
problems.  We have enough things to do as it is to start working on the
stuff that should 'just work' so we can get to the real job at hand.  (:

Also, not everyone has the skill to look through a huge project like mono to
find &amp; fix a problem that they have no idea how it is happening..  or
where.. or why..   and do you really want someone that doesn't know what
they're doing fixing it?  I guess this lays on the foundation of OSS though.

My $0.02.. hehe (:

Cheers,
Curtis.

I would add that &quot;Free&quot; software is not &quot;free&quot; as in &quot;free beer&quot;. It is
&quot;free&quot; as in &quot;freedom to do what you want with it&quot;, and with freedom
comes responsibility.

At first glance, since I have only seen this snippet of his original
post, if urgent Mac OSX support is that important to Mr. Mentzer, then
he could actually lend his support in the form of either evaluating the
source of the problems, fixing the problems himself and submitting
patches, or both.

My $0.02 (which is more than any of us pay to use this software).
