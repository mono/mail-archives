<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Down the road you may be able to run gtk-sharp on Mac or Windows, or run
</I>&gt;<i> Windows.Forms on *nix and Mac, but I would not recommend that, since
</I>&gt;<i> - Gtk is the native UI platform for *nix
</I>&gt;<i> - Windows.Forms is the native UI platform for Windows
</I>&gt;<i> - and, Cocoa is the native UI platform for Mac OS X
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You will NOT achieve a native look and feel using a NON-native UI platform!
</I>&gt;<i> That is my opinion, and is the current trend amongst many other developers.
</I>&gt;<i> Just look at java.awt and you know what I'm talking about.
</I>
Gtk can use an underlying engine to render to the system.  

Until recently, I was unaware that MacOS X had a thing called the
&quot;Appearance Manager&quot; which is some kind of library to do this.

Someone might be interested in doing a theme for Gtk+ that uses this. 
The other half of the equation would be to get the keybindings to match
the MacOS X, but that one is simpler than getting the theme done.

&gt;<i> Miguel just checked in some runtime fixes about 1 hour ago, and Paolo is
</I>&gt;<i> working on it as far as I know full time!
</I>
And Martin Baulig is joining us full time as wlel.
