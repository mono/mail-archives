</I>hello,

my  problem with gtk# personally is that mac os x is not supported. 
although you can find people who hacked it together, if  you co it from 
cvs, and install it, the samples don't work. i don't have a linux box, 
only a mac, and i would love to play with mono on it, but it's been two 
months now, and i don't feel any closer.

there are also problems with xsp, and sometimes mono doesn't compile 
either (i mean cvs version).
regards,

Attila
