<PRE>Hello - I tried to post it about 3 weeks ago,
but as there wasn't any answer I decided to
try again before giving it up.

I am completely new to Mono Project.
I must admit, that the progress you make
really amazed me and I'd like to congratulate
everyone who is involved in developing it.
I installed mono 0.31 on my Windows 2003 Server machine.

I went to simple example with odbc connection.
Although my example work very well in MS Framework,
when I port it to mono I always receive an error saying:
&quot;Error in SQLAllocHandle&quot;
I made some further test and found out, that this error
is thrown at the line:
m_cnADOConnection = new OdbcConnection();

what is a little bit strange - the line
m_cmdADOCommand = new OdbcCommand();
works well.
I also tested
m_cnADOConnection = new OdbcConnection(strConnectionString),
where strConnectionString contains valid connection string to my DB,
but the behaviour (and error) is the same.

I searched the archives of list and a very similar error was reported on
March 11th 2004,
but it was about a Linux machine.
There is another slight strange behaviour which I don't understand -
anytime when I try to execute with mono my simple example
using System.Windows.Forms I get the message:
&quot;Could not load winelib.exe.so&quot;, but then it runs almos OK
(despite the warning saying &quot;Missing call to FillRectangle in
OnPaintBackground&quot;).

Could anyone give me a hint how to solve this issues?
Am I missing something?
Thanks in advance!

Best regards,

Marcin Pytel
