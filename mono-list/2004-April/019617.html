<PRE>I downloaded the pre-built Windows installer. Aside from my permissions 
problem, that ran fine and installed without incident.

But I can't find anything at all on what to do next. The path was not 
set up, so I added the /bin directory manually, guessing that it was the 
right thing to do. I tried to test this by running 'mcs' (in a Cygwin 
Bash shell, and also in a DOS shell) and got the following error:

&quot;The application failed to initialize properly (0xc0000135). Click on OK 
to terminate the application.&quot;

This isn't exactly a surprise, considering mcs.exe is supposed to be a 
.NET executable, right? I notice there's a shell script called 'mcs', 
which kind of looks like it's supposed to run mcs.exe using mono, but 1) 
it has strange paths, 2) it's a Bourne shell script, this is Windows, 
and 3) as far as I can tell the .exe (having the same name, but with the 
.exe extension) will always run first, so I don't even know if I can run 
the script. Here's the entire contents:

#!/bin/sh
c:/b/install/bin/mono c:/b/install/bin/mcs.exe &quot;$@&quot;

My installation path is &quot;C:\Program Files\Mono-0.31&quot;, so I don't know 
where the /b/install stuff comes from.

I also tried to just run 'mono'. That gives the following error:

&quot;This application has failed to start because icuin26.dll was not found. 
Re-installing the application may fix this problem.&quot;

Can anyone clue me in on what to do or where to find information about 
how to complete a Windows install?

Thanks.

-Kevin
