</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. The mod-mono-server.exe is compiled to /usr/local/bin rather than
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/bin.  According to the web page I downloaded it from, /usr/bin
</I>&gt;<i> should have been its location.
</I>
Use ./configure --prefix=/usr

&gt;<i> 2. Apache 2.0.49 failed to start mod-mono-server.exe automatically.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe due to its non-standard location?  But I moved mod-mono-server.exe
</I>&gt;<i> to /usr/bin and it still did not get loaded by Apache automatically.
</I>
If mono and xsp are installed in prefix=/usr, it should work. If it
fails, look at the apache error_log file.

&gt;<i> 3. By starting mod-mono-server.exe manually on the command line, I've
</I>&gt;<i> managed to get /mono to work (the standard xsp/test directory), but my
</I>&gt;<i> root web which is an ASPX set does not load up.  Instead, I get the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Service Temporarily Unavailable&quot; error, which seems standard for when
</I>&gt;<i> the mod-mono-server.exe is not loaded.
</I>
That's a problem with file permissions that should go away if the module
successfully runs mod-mono-server.

&gt;<i> 4. No apache configuration files appears to have been automatically
</I>&gt;<i> modified, as the web page said they would be.
</I>
If make install run successfully and you didn't have LoadModule for
mod_mono, that line is added. If it's already there, nothing happens.
