&lt;With kindness&gt;
Well, I have to say that this is possibly why there are so many poor
windows applications that just don't understand the whole concept of
multi-user.  WordPerfect used to get it right, MS-Office didn't, neither
did Mavis Beacon and an entire range of software developed for Windows. 
It is getting better but any time any company developed for multiple
platforms and included Unix usually had a clue.  Please DO take the time
to learn new tricks.
