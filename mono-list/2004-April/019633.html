I think it's fine to post announcements of major releases of software
that runs on mono (especially if it's free software). Proprietary
software is tolerated (maybe just for the first relase:-), just don't post ads: 
the technical info is fine.
To make it more interesting to the audience it would also be useful to get
more mono-specific info like:
*) was the product developed to run on mono or is it a port of an app
that also runs on he MS CLR?
*) how was the porting and/or developing experience (did you find many
bugs/unimplemented features/stumbling blocks)?
*) how is the end result (stability, speed)?
*) what do you expect from the next mono releases as it relates to the
projects?

Thanks.
