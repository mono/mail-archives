<PRE>I was mentioning RPMS because that's what is being used by mono right
now to deliver content. If mono does it, we can assume most will follow
their lead.

In a sense, I'm questioning the fact that we are delivering .NET
applications through RPMS. It is a well established standard for
delivering binary files in UNIX. I'm not sure that it applies as well to
.NET packages. I can of course be wrong, so that would be a moot point
:<i>)

The library dependencies are one thing. There is also sometimes, more
involved configuration which can be required. For instance, for almost
all web application, a database will also need to be installed and
configured.=20

An install tool takes care of this. The install tool could also be used
to register libraries to the GAC and other little details. Actually, for
web deployment, I think Whidby is going to introduce a couple of new
tools. I'm not sure what the plan is about porting those tools to Mono
or MonoDevelop or SharpDevelop.

For the general case of distributing .NET applications, I agree,
however, he's discussing the specific case of distributing RPMS of .NET
applications.  In the specific case of RPM, there are a number of
applications whose sole intent is handling these dependency issues
somewhat transparently.  They are, admittedly, not as user-friendly as
they could be, but if you're going to the trouble to package your
application as an RPM, the added trouble of packaging any
as-yet-unpackaged dependencies and adding them all to a package
repository is minimal.  Doing so also ensures the automatic resolution
of dependencies for users who want to install your software.

If you're just throwing up a .zip file for your application, by all
means, put the (less commonly used) dependencies in the zip file with
the application...
