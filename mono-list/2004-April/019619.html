OK, I'm almost following this. I didn't know about the .bat files, but I 
see them in C:\Windows now. So if I don't screw with my path at all, I 
can use 'mono' and 'mcs' from a DOS prompt -- they will invoke the .bat 
files to do the right thing. However, in Bash I have to use the command 
'mono.bat' or 'mcs.bat', because it doesn't recognize and run a .bat 
file when the extension is not given. I should be able to fix this with 
a few shell scripts.

I don't know about putting mono.exe and mcs.exe in my Bash path, though. 
It won't help me run them without specifying the .bat, as far as I can 
tell. Unless it's required for other reasons, it seems like I should 
leave them out.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> If mono.exe and mcs.exe are in your PATH, then they get run BEFORE mono.bat
</I>&gt;<i> and mcs.bat

Yes, if they are earlier in the path and you use the command 'mono' or 
'mcs' (without giving the .bat extension). At least I think that's the 
way it works.

</I>
Yeah, that's a good point. I've had problems with this in the past. I'll 
probably move it to be safe.

Thanks.
