As Ales Pour already mentioned, this is incorrect.  IIS is not needed. 
For example, mod_mono and xsp.exe are two separate ASP.NET hosting
environments developed by Mono.  (xsp.exe was the original test
container, useful for testing, and mod_mono is an Apache module for
hosting ASP.NET.)

Existing AXIS users may find this useful, but I doubt that existing
ASP.NET users would.  Just my $0.02...

AppDomain support is...flaky.  You can create AppDomains, and run code
in them, but unloading them...tends to break things.  Zoltan added a
patch to ignore AppDomain.Unload() when the MONO_NO_UNLOAD environment
variable is set on March 24, so that existing code (NAnt) would continue
to function properly until the underlying AppDomain issues were
resolved.  I don't think this made it into 0.31, though.

So, until the bugs are fixed (which is until the next release, *at
least*), avoid AppDomain.Unload(). :-)
