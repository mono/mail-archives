<PRE>Hello,

	Currently PERWAPI seems to be unfinished/unreleased and has been for
some time. If you are willing to do some work Mono.PEToolkit
(mcs/class/Mono.PEToolkit) actually does what you would need, but will
need a little API love to make it work the way you want. Also look at
the command line interface for monodis, it does everything you need and
you could either A) Pinvoke into it (might require some love too), or B)
call it and parse its text.

Hope this helps,
Jackson
