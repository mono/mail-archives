<PRE>Hello,

I reviewed the PowerPoint slides that Erik Dasque posted on Monologue
yesterday.  In those slides (and elsewhere in various articles on the
'net) there is a statistic that the City of Munich is operating 350 Mono
ASP.NET servers serving 150,000 users.

That is quite an impressive feat, and I am trying to gather more
information about this application.  Can anyone validate this statistic
and tell me a little about what the application is, what it does, how the
deployment went, how long it has been in production, etc.?

On IRC yesterday it was mentioned that the statistic simply came from a
response to the call for success stories, and the name Volcker.com was
mentioned, however I can't seem to bring up their website.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Joe
