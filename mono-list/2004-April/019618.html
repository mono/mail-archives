<PRE>If you are running it in the MS DOS shell, make sure mono &quot;is not in&quot; your
PATH.

You run mono like: mono
or mcs like: mcs

Also, if you are running it in Cygwin bash shell, make sure you put mono and
msc &quot;in&quot; your PATH.  This PATH in cygwin can be set editing your
.bash_profile to include mono in your PATH.
To run mono: mono.bat
To run mcs: mcs.bat

The reasoning behind this (I think):
If mono.exe and mcs.exe are in your PATH, then they get run BEFORE mono.bat
and mcs.bat

My personal experience has shown not to install stuff to a directory with
spaces in the file name, such as, &quot;Program Files&quot;.
At the company I work at, the company policy requires that any network
shares and folders should not contain any spaces.

I downloaded the pre-built Windows installer. Aside from my permissions
problem, that ran fine and installed without incident.

But I can't find anything at all on what to do next. The path was not
set up, so I added the /bin directory manually, guessing that it was the
right thing to do. I tried to test this by running 'mcs' (in a Cygwin
Bash shell, and also in a DOS shell) and got the following error:

&quot;The application failed to initialize properly (0xc0000135). Click on OK
to terminate the application.&quot;

This isn't exactly a surprise, considering mcs.exe is supposed to be a
.NET executable, right? I notice there's a shell script called 'mcs',
which kind of looks like it's supposed to run mcs.exe using mono, but 1)
it has strange paths, 2) it's a Bourne shell script, this is Windows,
and 3) as far as I can tell the .exe (having the same name, but with the
.exe extension) will always run first, so I don't even know if I can run
the script. Here's the entire contents:

#!/bin/sh
c:/b/install/bin/mono c:/b/install/bin/mcs.exe &quot;$@&quot;

My installation path is &quot;C:\Program Files\Mono-0.31&quot;, so I don't know
where the /b/install stuff comes from.

I also tried to just run 'mono'. That gives the following error:

&quot;This application has failed to start because icuin26.dll was not found.
Re-installing the application may fix this problem.&quot;

Can anyone clue me in on what to do or where to find information about
how to complete a Windows install?

Thanks.

-Kevin
