<PRE>Hi! Why, of course I'll be working on it, because I need the
functionality :)
There're several issues however:
At first, I tried to put together an independent assembly, but it's a
real pain because everything useful in System.Drawing is internal and
private :)
e.g. to create a Graphics you need to make a static method inside
Graphics, because all the constructors are private. I didn't find any
other way at this point. The c binding can however be split from
libgdiplus.

On the second hand, Graphics has FromHwnd (which I beleive is wins
only), so why not have FromGdk? Is it the specification which is so
pro-windows :)

I'll look into the issue further --Artem
