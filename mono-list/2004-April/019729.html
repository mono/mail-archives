Thanks! :)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But my question is there any logging implemented with xsp or

</I>&gt;<i> XSP and mod-mono-server somewhat remind me of Tomcat in the sense of what

</I>&gt;<i> Is there anything like this implimented with xsp or mod-mono-server? or is

I can add configuration directives for apache in which you can pass
additional options to mono  (such as --debug or --trace=....) and also
provide a file name to get the output. Is that what you want?
