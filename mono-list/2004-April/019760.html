to Real that it has a version of Media Player for Linux yet I have not 
seen it.

I tend to disagree, Microsoft is doing a fine job of innovating with its 
developer tools and increasing the reliability of its Operating 
Systems.  If Microsoft had kept going its route of just pushing VB and 
insecure Windows then Microsoft would have lost big time.  As it turns 
out Microsoft is starting to get serious again making good products like 
they did with NT 3.51 and the very first versions of Office

&gt;<i>  Instead, I'd takethe opposite view that competitors should be allowed to bundle their softwarewith Windows via OEMs, as opposed to choking Microsofts' right to innovate. This would then present a level playing field.
