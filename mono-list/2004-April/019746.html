</I>&gt;<i> no way a invitation for a flame war and is not inteded to be abusive or 
</I>&gt;<i> disrespectful to Miguel.  Enjoy if you decide to read it.

I do not think you understood what I wrote, because we pretty much
agree on most things.

My list of ways in which Microsoft won was not comprehensive.

Every once in a while I forget Microsoft anti-competitive practices, as
times goes by, and with their new &quot;face&quot;, its easy to forget.

But it is always illustrative to read the actual depositions in the EU
trial, or the US one:

Microsoft can build some good products, but they also made sure of
using every bit of power they had in their reach to make sure they
dominated.
