Hi all,

Developing and delivering software like Mono is not an easy task and a 
complex engineering project. We're committed to delivering Mono 1.0 in 
June and supporting the Linux x86, MacOS X platforms, have no doubt 
about that. As you know we also intend to provide support for Solaris 
and Linux PPC. We're also committed to delivering GTK# 1.0 in this 
release and SWF by the end of the year.

We are privileged to observe the evolution of Mono on a daily basis. In 
my previous job, building from the source was something you didn't want 
to do unless you had to, builds were often broken and unreliable. A 
good build, one QA could work on, was a rare commodity. Most of us 
build Mono from CVS everyday with its share of frustration and 
disillusions but all in all, it often works. My main machine is a 
Powerbook running MacOS X but I also run Linux PPC, Linux x86 and 
Windows XP ; I have to because like Miguel, our Ximian engineers and 
all the good people contributing to Mono, I want to make sure we 
deliver on our promises. And because I mainly use MacOS X, I harass 
Miguel everyday about bugs I find. Mono on PPC has been frustrating in 
the last few weeks but I run 0.31 with some success. Recently, Miguel 
asked Martin to help out on PPC ; with his involvement in addition to 
Paolo's and Miguel's, I am confident we'll be successful.

Original Message -----------------------

&lt;excerpt&gt;my  problem with gtk# personally is that mac os x is not
supported.

although you can find people who hacked it together, if  you co it

from cvs, and install it, the samples don't work. i don't have a linux

box, only a mac, and i would love to play with mono on it, but it's

been two months now, and i don't feel any closer.


there are also problems with xsp, and sometimes mono doesn't compile

either (i mean cvs version).

regards,

&lt;/excerpt&gt;

Grudgingly, I have to agree with above statement(s).  Mono support for

Mac OS X/ PPC is fragile at best.  I even tried to put together a page

on the basic steps (

<A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/griffincaprio/mono/RunningMonoOnMacOSX.html">http://homepage.mac.com/griffincaprio/mono/RunningMonoOnMacOSX.html</A> ),

but I have all but given up trying to maintain that page.  This is

because mono not reliable from day to day, release to release, on the

PPC / Mac OS X platform.


I am not saying that running off the CVS tree is the most stable way to

work, but this goes for the releases also.  0.29 worked on the PPC,

0.30 didn't  without some major hacking.  0.31 doesn't work reliably,

either.


Some of the steps I have taken to compile mono include:

- configure switches

- external, 3rd party source downloads

- editing actual code/headers to accommodate the PPC platform.


What's worse, is that when I encounter errors, i receive almost no help

on the mailing lists.  Some of these are not doubt strange errors, and

some are very common, but my posts go unanswered either way.


I haven't even gotten to gtk#...


Segmentation faults, bus errors, frozen compiles, etc....  The list

goes on and on.  I hope to come back to mono in a few months, when/if

PPC support is better.  But for now, I feel that it's a lost cause.
