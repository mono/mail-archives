<PRE>Ok, there are a few factors to consider here:

JITing takes a hit *once* -- remember, once a method is jitted, there is
0 cost. For something like SciMark, you are running the test for a
pretty long time. So, if there is a .01 second delay in jitting it on a
1 second test, you wont see anything.

AOT can cause code to be aligned differently, because it emits some
slightly different constructs. This can give misleading results.

There are some cases where the AOT emits code that we could work on
optimizing. However, this is mostly not in the areas that SciMark tests.

Anyways, having numbers is very valuable. I would love if you were to
post your benchmark results from week to week.
