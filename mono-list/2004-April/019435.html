Considering that it might not even be released, I for one would not
focus on IronPython at all...

Quoted from <A HREF="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/03/31/pycon.html:">http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/03/31/pycon.html:</A>

&quot;Alas, Hugunin is not releasing this implementation, which he calls
IronPython, until (or unless?) he can figure out how to complete it,
which I took to mean until or unless he can figure out how to have that
development funded. That's too bad, especially since it means that his
performance claims cannot be duplicated, and others who are interested
cannot contribute to IronPython. One of the main areas of performance
increase in IronPython is in user defined functions, which can be many
times faster in IronPython than in CPython.&quot;

Best,

/Richard
