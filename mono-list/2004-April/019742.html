</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; method) and dump it to a text file but that doesn't really do it for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; me. XSP and mod-mono-server somewhat remind me of Tomcat in the sense
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; of what I was thinking in the way of logging. e.g. catalina.out
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Is there anything like this implimented with xsp or mod-mono-server?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; or is it going to be implimented sometime? I understand the oracle
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; data adapter thing might still be under development, but I somtimes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; get confused as to why it locks mod-mono-server up on me when I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; using it. As it could very well be me making mistakes or something.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can add configuration directives for apache in which you can pass
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; additional options to mono  (such as --debug or --trace=....) and also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; provide a file name to get the output. Is that what you want?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -Gonzalo
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes and no, that would also be a nice addition. But mostly I am interested
</I>&gt;<i> in logging only relavent info of xsp or the mod-mono-server deamons. Such
</I>&gt;<i> as start, stops, crashes(with reason), application/compile errors and
</I>&gt;<i> timestamp so you can sort of go back and track things down when they go
</I>&gt;<i> wrong. A lot like $CATALINA_HOME/logs/catalina.out with rotating log files
</I>&gt;<i> if you are by chance familiar with Tomcat.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe running with debug and stack trace would generate a lot of extra
</I>&gt;<i> information in a not so graceful manner even thou it would monitor the
</I>&gt;<i> actual process right? It seems like it is a valuable means of getting
</I>&gt;<i> things going, but not something you would want to use on a productions
</I>&gt;<i> system. Would this not be the case?
</I>
I used to run either daemontools or runit (the same thing but without
the restrictions of daemontools).

These can keep a log for what you want, but you have to run
mod-mono-server / xsp manually.
