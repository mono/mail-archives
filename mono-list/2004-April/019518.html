<PRE>I would add that &quot;Free&quot; software is not &quot;free&quot; as in &quot;free beer&quot;. It is
&quot;free&quot; as in &quot;freedom to do what you want with it&quot;, and with freedom
comes responsibility.

At first glance, since I have only seen this snippet of his original
post, if urgent Mac OSX support is that important to Mr. Mentzer, then
he could actually lend his support in the form of either evaluating the
source of the problems, fixing the problems himself and submitting
patches, or both.

My $0.02 (which is more than any of us pay to use this software).
