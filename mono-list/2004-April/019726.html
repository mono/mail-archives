<PRE>First let me say I'm still trying to learn the ropes of Mono and I've had
my eye on it for some time... Didn't have a problem setting it up and
getting it all going like a charm with
Apache2/mono-0.31/mod_mono-0.9/xsp-0.12 on RH9, SLES 8, and Sun Java
Desktop connecting to oracle 9i with the data reader... (data adapter is
still a bit iffy but it kind of works for me) So I wanted to say &quot;Thanks&quot;
for the work on an alternative solution to ASP.NET! Great work so far and
I'm really looking forward to mbas/vb.net functionality with it!

But my question is there any logging implemented with xsp or
mod-mono-server? As far as I've figured out, you can run it with -v
manually (don't know about the new mod_mono-0.9 and .12 auto launch
method) and dump it to a text file but that doesn't really do it for me.
XSP and mod-mono-server somewhat remind me of Tomcat in the sense of what
I was thinking in the way of logging. e.g. catalina.out

Is there anything like this implimented with xsp or mod-mono-server? or is
it going to be implimented sometime? I understand the oracle data adapter
thing might still be under development, but I somtimes get confused as to
why it locks mod-mono-server up on me when I'm using it. As it could very
well be me making mistakes or something.
