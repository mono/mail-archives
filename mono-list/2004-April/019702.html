<PRE>Thank you.  I used ./configure --prefix=3D/usr, and the mod_mono and XSP =
installed in the /usr/bin folder now instead of /usr/local/bin, as I =
wanted.  However, Apache2's errorlog still indicated that Apache 2 was =
looking in the /usr/local/bin folder for both &quot;mono&quot; and =
&quot;mod-mono-server&quot;.  Do I have old files that need to be removed =
somewhere?  A workaround was to create to symbolic links, one for each =
file that was sought.

Second, the MonoApplications directive in Apache's configuration file =
works fine.  But I want my root web site to be a Mono web app.  I tried =
&quot;MonoRoot&quot;, and that didn't work.  I also tried using MonoApplications =
&quot;/:/home/Andrew/localweb/&quot; and that failed also.  Any ideas?

Thanks for your help.

El mi=E9, 21-04-2004 a las 18:37, Andrew Arnott escribi=F3:
&gt;<i> I had a root directory and the /mono virtual directory set up
</I>&gt;<i> previously, but since upgrading to mod_mono 0.8 and XSP 0.11, I have
</I>&gt;<i> noticed several issues:
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> 1. The mod-mono-server.exe is compiled to /usr/local/bin rather than
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/bin.  According to the web page I downloaded it from, /usr/bin
</I>&gt;<i> should have been its location.
</I>
Use ./configure --prefix=3D/usr

&gt;<i> 2. Apache 2.0.49 failed to start mod-mono-server.exe automatically.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe due to its non-standard location?  But I moved =
</I>mod-mono-server.exe
&gt;<i> to /usr/bin and it still did not get loaded by Apache automatically.
</I>
If mono and xsp are installed in prefix=3D/usr, it should work. If it
fails, look at the apache error_log file.

&gt;<i> 3. By starting mod-mono-server.exe manually on the command line, I've
</I>&gt;<i> managed to get /mono to work (the standard xsp/test directory), but my
</I>&gt;<i> root web which is an ASPX set does not load up.  Instead, I get the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Service Temporarily Unavailable&quot; error, which seems standard for when
</I>&gt;<i> the mod-mono-server.exe is not loaded.
</I>
That's a problem with file permissions that should go away if the module
successfully runs mod-mono-server.

&gt;<i> 4. No apache configuration files appears to have been automatically
</I>&gt;<i> modified, as the web page said they would be.
</I>
If make install run successfully and you didn't have LoadModule for
mod_mono, that line is added. If it's already there, nothing happens.
