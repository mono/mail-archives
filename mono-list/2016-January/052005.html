<PRE>Hi Timotheus,

Thanks for your reply.  Unfortunately, changing from WinExe to Exe doesn&#185;t
help as it still wants an X Display.  Also, most of the business logic is
separate from the gui .  However, the multithreading uses Background
Workers, which to my knowledge, requires an event loop to handle the
ProgressChanged and WorkerCompleted events.  If I don&#185;t display the form,
the Progress Changed event is raised, but the UI thread doesn&#185;t handle it.
So if I drive the business logic without any forms (which would be nice),
I&#185;d be forced to change the implementation to using C# threads instead of
Background Workers.  This isn&#185;t entirely impossible, but will take much
longer.  I have three weeks (otherwise, I wouldn&#185;t try to bother the list,
I&#185;d work it out myself :D).

Perhaps there are generic Event Loops in C# that could listen for events
from the BackgroundWorkers, but I&#185;ve yet to find them.

Note:  This isn&#185;t exactly a problem with Mono.  If I create and display
the form, from which the Background Workers are created and run, it works
fine in both Mono and Windows.  If I create the form but do not display it
(insatiate, initialize the form, and instantiate several background
workers), the UI thread terminates before the Background Workers in BOTH
Mono and Windows.  The question is really a matter of what Makes Mono
require X?  Is it the project type (doesn&#185;t seem to be), or is it the fact
that I&#185;m creating objects from the Forms object hierarchy? Also, is there
a cheap, dirty trick to just not attempt to connect to X, yet still have
the logic run?

It&#185;s looking more and more inevitable that if I wanted a multithreaded C#
app under mono, and require it to run without X, BackgroundWorker isn&#185;t a
solution.  If that&#185;s the case, I guess I can accept that.

&gt;<i>Hello George,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Question First:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The main question I had for the Mono list is this.  Is it possible to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mono run Windows Forms code without trying to open X11 (I.e. headless
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>mode)?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What triggers mono to request an X11 display? Is it the project type?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Is it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the call to an object that inherits from a Windows Forms control?  I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>don&#185;t
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need to see the form, but if I&#185;m using BackgroundWorkers, I need the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>form's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> event handler, don&#185;t I?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>You should try to modify the project type, ie OutputType in the csproj
</I>&gt;<i>file, WinExe vs Exe.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I know this may be confusing, and if so, please feel free to ask for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clarifications, or even just to say &#179;Why would you want to do that?&#178;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I wonder if you could cleanly separate the business logic from the
</I>&gt;<i>gui. Then you can have a dll with the business logic, which you can
</I>&gt;<i>reference from your winforms forms, but also from your console
</I>&gt;<i>application.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>hope this helps,
