<PRE>Again, I agree with the separation of business logic from the GUI.  In
fact, on mono, I never want to see the GUI.  It&#185;s due to the fact that my
parallelism relies on multiple concurrent BackgroundWorkers.  I&#185;m
restricted to .net 2.0 , nothing later.  So I don&#185;t have the TPL
available.  I have BackgroundWorkers, Threads, and Threadpool.  As I
understand it, Threadpools don&#185;t have a way to know when they are finished
(at least, not directly).  Perhaps I misunderstand.  BackgroundWorkers are
simple, and are performing their function perfectly on Mono, so long as X
is there.  The only option left is directly using Threads.

So to be clear, the only reason I wanted Windows Forms on Mono is to use
BackgroundWorker because it&#185;s simple and it works.

</I>&gt;<i>2. You really should separate your business logic from the GUI code.
</I>&gt;<i>3. In general, you should not expect WinForms to work well on anything
</I>&gt;<i>other than windows. If you need a GUI for other platforms, design a new
</I>&gt;<i>one, or use a cross-platform GUI toolkit such as Eto.Forms. If you don't
</I>&gt;<i>need a GUI... Then separate the WinForms GUI code from the non-GUI code,
</I>&gt;<i>so you can build your non-windows project independently of WinForms.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Really, the core logic should be moved to its own assembly, so the
</I>&gt;<i>winforms project and console project can both reference it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>There is *some* support for WinForms on non-windows platforms. Rarely
</I>&gt;<i>does it ever work well - nobody on a mac or linux wants windows that look
</I>&gt;<i>like WinForms - and that's if it works at all. (Lots of times it's
</I>&gt;<i>straight up nonfunctional). Even if it works perfectly, nobody wants to
</I>&gt;<i>be dependent on launching X11 on a mac, and it's only *sometimes*
</I>&gt;<i>acceptable on linux.
