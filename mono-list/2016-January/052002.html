<PRE>I have been trying to port my windows winforms app to Mac.I have managed to
port it successfully by replacing winforms with gtk#.Background worker has
some issues when there was concurrent execution,i switched to threads
,threads gave some other issues  so i switched back to background worker and
ironed out the issues. 

 
The point i want to make is even if you manage to port the application the
following problems exists which keeps you from proper deployment 

-If you are using System.Drawing then your app first launch in a new
computer will take around 3 minutes.The user does not see any progress

-Bundling Mono Runtime(Standalone app)- simply does not work properly.You
need to write some custom script 

-Mono(Mono.Mac not Xamarin.Mac) support is non existent.You can see this
forum is full of spam and rarely someone replies.

I have done all the hardwork,including the tons of workarounds for the buggy
IDE which wasted lots of my time.Finally im here unable to properly deploy
my app,because MONO is broken(if you go the gtk or the winforms way)

If you want to use Mono and want 'support' and a thing that runs.You can
build a Native UI using cocoa and use c# code.

Just sharing :)
