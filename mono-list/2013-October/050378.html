<PRE>The idea of having a qt interface for widemargin has been running
around in my mind for a while now.

I already have GTK# and WPF interfaces built using an MVC pattern, so
what's one more right?

Also qt has better support for touch and resolution independence then
GTK and would allow me to target platforms like ubuntu touch.

The sticky point in all this is that there are no c# qt5 bindings
available and writing a c# wrapper for a library as big as qt5 is
daunting to say the least. Especially for someone like me with very
little c++ experience.

However writing a c# wrapper for qt5 might not be necessary. It is now
possible to write all of your qt GUI code with QML and javascript. And
to call though to c++ only for your heavy lifting. If we use QML the
problem shits from allowing qt5 to be called from c#. To allowing c#
code to be called from QML.

This has recently been done for the GO language here:
<A HREF="https://github.com/niemeyer/qml">https://github.com/niemeyer/qml</A>

I have read the information about embedding mono
(<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Embedding_Mono">http://www.mono-project.com/Embedding_Mono</A>)  and am wondering if this
could somehow be used to create a QML c# bridge.

Are any of you interested in using QML with c#? and if so do you have
any ideas about how it could be achieved?

Cheers,
Daniel Hughes
