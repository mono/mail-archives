Solution for the &quot;it prints nothing&quot; issue:

You can't get a single .exe under Windows due to a technical
limitation of the Boehm GC: It needs a DLL.

This might not apply to the SGen GC, but I don't even know
if it works under Windows nowadays.

If you'd somehow manage to get a static build, there would be still
an issue with it: because the Mono runtime is licensed under LGPL,
you'd need to obtain a commercial license from Xamarin, unless
your application is licensed under the (L)GPL as well.
