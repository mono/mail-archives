<PRE>I use a .net 4.0 features in widemargin, because they improve
the language and make developing easier.

I would not support any regression in features compared to microsoft .net

Doing so would also make it difficult to use mono for cross platform
development.

Cheer,
Daniel Hughes

</I>&gt;<i> much advantage here.  Or are you talking about something else relevant that
</I>&gt;<i> has occurred with myspace recently?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think, Mono should not continue run after Microsoft, .net 2.0 is enough.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think it runs after Microsoft. It is a community supported
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of the CLR and the C# language, and follows the same
</I>&gt;<i> language specification that Microsoft does, so you can expect some
</I>&gt;<i> similarities. You should also note that the mono framework in general
</I>&gt;<i> supports things that Microsoft's implementation does not, such as a POSIX
</I>&gt;<i> implementation layer for running CLR applications on POSIX compliant
</I>&gt;<i> systems such as Linux and UNIX, a messaging layer that integrates with
</I>&gt;<i> RabbitMQ instead of MSMQ, a scriptable csharp shell, etc. If the mono
</I>&gt;<i> community feels it should create functionality to add to the framework,
</I>&gt;<i> there is an open path to contribution, and quite often, Mono includes
</I>&gt;<i> components in the framework that were not built directly by the core Mono
</I>&gt;<i> contributors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At .net 2.0 version , Microsoft finish the .net platform building. Since
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> version 2.0, Microsoft's main work on .net is to build new components
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> around
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since 2006 when you wrote this email, there have been a few .NET and C#
</I>&gt;<i> language releases, such as 3.0, 4.0, 5.0. These included features like
</I>&gt;<i> implicitly declared types, lambda expressions, dynamic language support,
</I>&gt;<i> async language support, and so on. Other languages have also added similar
</I>&gt;<i> features, or have plans to in the near future, such as Java 8 coming in
</I>&gt;<i> 2013 that will support the same sort of lambdas that C# introduced in 2006.
</I>&gt;<i> Just because Java is also going to have lambda support probably doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> mean it is chasing Microsoft either, but simply wants to provide support
</I>&gt;<i> for language features that it's developer community have come to expect. I
</I>&gt;<i> don't think many languages would survive for very long if they don't
</I>&gt;<i> continue to grow and evolve to support the needs of their developers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Platform Independent  is not practical for a technology that is hold a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> private company like Microsoft.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's an odd statement. It is true that Microsoft doesn't make a
</I>&gt;<i> tremendous effort to make .NET platform independent (that's what mono does,
</I>&gt;<i> remember?), but they have come around in the past few years (while this
</I>&gt;<i> email has been stuck in your outbox) with an appreciation for the open
</I>&gt;<i> source community.  They have made some large frameworks open source, many
</I>&gt;<i> of which are included in Mono due to the efforts of the Mono community.
</I>&gt;<i>  These probably didn't exist back in 2006, but the ASP.NET MVC framework
</I>&gt;<i> and the Entity Framework are two tremendous frameworks that Microsoft has
</I>&gt;<i> made open source.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why would such contributions be practical? Well, this also didn't exist in
</I>&gt;<i> 2006, but Microsoft has a cloud service called Azure, and they have an
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity to make money off of their Azure services whether they run on
</I>&gt;<i> Windows or not. In fact, there is a great amount of support for
</I>&gt;<i> non-Microsoft technologies, like Java, PHP, and even Linux VM's that can
</I>&gt;<i> support Mono. Microsoft really doesn't care too much if your running under
</I>&gt;<i> Azure directly or inside a Windows VM or inside a Linux VM - the money they
</I>&gt;<i> make from their infrastructure spends the same.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I recommend that, mono should only implement  C# 2.0, and do a little
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modify. And mono and mnodevelop should not support so many languages like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> C\C++\VB. Mono and Monodevelop should only support one language c# 2.0.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This was a reasonable position in 2006. Now, I suggest we take it a little
</I>&gt;<i> further and only implement C# 5.0, at least until the 6.0 spec comes out.
</I>&gt;<i> Don't get me wrong, generics are awesome, but I wouldn't stop there when
</I>&gt;<i> implicit declaration and lambdas can provide such productivity improvements.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I probably wouldn't do &quot;a little modify&quot; though, because then you have
</I>&gt;<i> some weird implementation of a language that only runs on one framework. I
</I>&gt;<i> think the goal of Mono is probably to maintain cross platform compatibility
</I>&gt;<i> wherever possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hey, what do you think about supporting F#? Is it a bad idea to support
</I>&gt;<i> that? What about IronPython, Boo, Scala, or, well, Java (via IKVM)?  Why do
</I>&gt;<i> you think it's a bad idea to support all of these languages?  What about
</I>&gt;<i> the developers who actively use these languages on the mono runtime?  I
</I>&gt;<i> guess maybe we should just convert everything to C# 2.0, but to be honest,
</I>&gt;<i> it's going to take a while even to convert all my C# 4 code to run under C#
</I>&gt;<i> 2.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mono should focus its energy on high performance and platform independent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  .
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think it does. You can read about such things at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/What_is_Mono">http://www.mono-project.com/What_is_Mono</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anders is not a master, he is just a senior developer. His level and state
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of mind is so low.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This seems like an odd place to make a personal attack on Anders. I think
</I>&gt;<i> you should go to a C# language conference and provide him some guidance as
</I>&gt;<i> I've never seen him post here. Please, though, read up on C# 3, 4, and 5
</I>&gt;<i> before you do so you can really contribute some insight to the discussions
</I>&gt;<i> on all the purported missteps made in the last several years.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you want to build a new world, you must be a master, not a workman.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed. Hey, it sounds like you've got some experience designing some
</I>&gt;<i> pretty nice languages. I'm kind of a languages geek myself. Can I try one
</I>&gt;<i> of yours?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Let's  make mono a &quot;C# 2.0 without Microsoft&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think it is. I think you might want to at least maybe read the first
</I>&gt;<i> paragraph on <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/What_is_Mono">http://www.mono-project.com/What_is_Mono</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am running C# 2.0 on RHEL, CentOS, Ubuntu, Mac OS X, and my Raspberry
</I>&gt;<i> Pi, to which Microsoft didn't really contribute a whole lot. I've run mono
</I>&gt;<i> for everything from large scale enterprise applications to websites to
</I>&gt;<i> video games. It performs great, runs everywhere. And in cases where I need
</I>&gt;<i> to, it's nice that I can also run all of this on Windows, because you know
</I>&gt;<i> the saying, nobody ever got fired for running Microsoft back in 2006, am I
</I>&gt;<i> right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I've got to get back to a Sunday afternoon hack fest.  I hope your
</I>&gt;<i> flame war goes well.  Congrats on getting that old clunker of a machine
</I>&gt;<i> back up and running!  You might want to check your sent items (or whatever
</I>&gt;<i> they were called in 2006) to see if any other zany messages went out.
