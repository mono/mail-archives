<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> There are a bunch of thorny issues to consider.
</I>
Heh, I would imagine ;)

I would not expect to support binaries from MSVC (even on Windows). After
all, Mingw and obviously Linux versions of vanilla GCC do not support them
due to things like name mangling.

I would be extremely happy to just be able to compile multiple binaries
specific to the platforms I am targeting (as I currently do with native C++
builds) but with the benefit of using the same .NET plugins (written in C#)
and all the functionality that .NET provides.

So basically, as it stands I don't particularly see a need for /clr:safe or
a 100% .NET output because we already have C# for that. Platform specific
binaries would obviously be the aim so we can take advantage of OS specific
functionality anyway (such as sys/sockets in UNIX and DirectX in Windows)

The AOT stuff does actually sound like a good idea. I didn't think of that.
Obviously we would need a way to parse out the code to generate it.

As for someone doing it... How long in man hours do you predict it will
take?
