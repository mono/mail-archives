I was trying to offer constructive criticism and maybe generate some 
discussion that might lead to an improvement to the website.  At this point, 
this is all I have to offer.  I took into consideration that it was very 
possible that the people in charge of the website may not be aware that the 
website lacks focus.  Therefore, I was just trying to bring the problem to 
their attention.

I am using Mandrake 10 right now.  I've heard of Red Carpet.  But, I haven't 
ever used it.  I'll take a look at it.  But, this begs the question, &quot;If Red 
Carpet is the preferred way to install Mono, why isn't there a big fat link 
saying 'Start Here if you want to try Mono' on the front of the mono home 
page pointing to the Red Carpet tools with directions on how to install 
mono?&quot;

This is true.
