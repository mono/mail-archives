Hi,

&gt;<i> i try to get working out System.windows.winforms but when i try to execut=
</I>e =3D
&gt;<i>  a simple apllication,  i get a semgmenation error !=3D20
</I>&gt;<i> WHY ????
</I>
No idea. All I can think of is that you have a conflict somewhere. When
you compiled the code using the newest version of mcs (etc), what did
you have on the command line as the -r:/ arguments? Let's try and chase
it from there=20

&gt;<i> Wine is working perfectly, winelib is installed and mono too... not the w=
</I>in=3D
&gt;<i> elib.exe.so error and mono is working fine alone.
</I>
That's useful to know. I take it you're using 0.91 of mono/mcs, 0.2 of
winelib and the April version of Wine?

&gt;<i> i ve mono compiled from source on a debian system
</I>
Which version of gcc did you use? 2.95.4 sucks big time and has lots of
evil problems.

&gt;<i> Sorry for flood, first i use a mailing llist but now i know how to use it=
</I> ;)=20

Good. It also helps if you're considerate on the subject line. A lot of
spam filters would reject the wording you used.
