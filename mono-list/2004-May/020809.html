<PRE>Hello... I just joined this list, and thought I'd write a brief intro
message.  Apologies in advance if this is out of line. (I couldn't locate a
&quot;list charter&quot;)

I'm interested in C# and ASP.NET out of technical curiousity / hacking
instinct and also out of desire to keep abreast of technology for the sake
of my career.  Since I will not likely be able to use .NET in my job in the
near future, my plan is to use it instead for development on a web site I
manage on a volunteer basis for a non-profit organization.

I am hosting the site through &quot;linode.com&quot; which provides me with a Linux
VPS (virtual private server), which I'm finding quite exciting since it
gives me full control (root access) of my &quot;virtual server&quot; at quite a low
cost to the organization.  The organization also gives me pretty much a free
hand in how I develop the site (one of the advantages of working for free
:<i>). I have Debian/woody and apache running on my server (although other
</I>distros are possible if I would want to rebuild the server).

So I figure Mono is the perfect match between my .NET learning goals and my
hosting situation.  Since I have root access I can install whatever I want,
so why not use &quot;mod-mono&quot; for my server-based processing needs?  As of now,
my site sticks with straight HTML, although there are definite possibilities
for going further.

So far I have installed mono using the stable (woody) debian package at
<A HREF="http://www.debianplanet.org/mono">http://www.debianplanet.org/mono</A> and succussfully compiled and run a &quot;hello
world&quot; console program (yay!).  However, I have not yet figured out how to
install the apache module &quot;mod-mono&quot; for &quot;woody&quot;.   (It does not seem to be
available at debianplanet).

I'd appreciate any assistance on installing mod-mono, as well as any general
comments and suggestions regarding my plans, including links to introductory
resources such as Howtos and tutorials.
