<PRE>YOU GUYS ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!

I am sooooo happy to find MONO (wow. That is funny. My wife thought she
had mono when she found out she was pregnant, now I am happy I found
Mono).

I am a .NET developer who has been desperately looking for a way out of
the Microsoft World. It is not that I hate them all though I am an X-Apple
advocate. I just wanted something better. Now with OS X and the G4/G5 s, I
have been ripping myself apart trying figure out how to get my Web dev
business to move away from MS.NET and you have given me a way out.

YEEEEAAAAAH!!!!!!

Thank you Mono Community. I am very much looking forward to your final
release on June 30. Shortly there after I will begin moving my customers
to Unix and MONO.

Thanks again. I am looking forward to re-compiling my C#.NET code on MONO.


Thank you,
Joshua Lewis
