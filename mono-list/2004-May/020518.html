I would even go further, why the hell are we &quot;developers&quot; discussing this?
When working in a firm, this is something the legal department has to do. We
do not know anything about this, because we are developers, not lawyers. So,
as we know nothing about legal issues, why are we over and over again
discussing these? 

Living in the Netherlands (EU), I just cannot comprehend all the time that
is put into these discussions. 

No offense to anyone, but plz let's start coding again and leave these
discussions to people who get paid to do these.

Greetz,
