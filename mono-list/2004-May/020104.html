<PRE>hi,

i recall that at some point there was some talk of creating a live-cd to
showcase mono progress for those not willing and/or able to install it
on their own machine. 

is this still a feasible option and if so, is anyone working on
something to this effect? i did some quick searching of which live-cd
distros would be best suitable and in terms of current configuration of
the live-cd (read: the default wm, the packaging system, how up-to-date
the distro is etc...) and the pld live cd
(<A HREF="http://www.distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=pld">http://www.distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=pld</A>) seems well
suited for this (defaults to gnome, has current kernel  and gnome/gtk
packages, is rpm-based, includes apache 2.0.49, gcc 3.3.3, and other
niceties).  

i have not  ever  tried the pld live cd i must admit and the polish
pages make it  hard for me to say how easily it can be remastered
(though according to the translation engine  at www.poltran.com &quot;scripts
have been placed on plate for remasteringu. there short instruction is
placed too&quot; - [allyourbasearebelongtous...] :-).   

the idea of a mono live cd is seems like a very positive thing to me to
increase awareness and ease transition from other platforms. anyone else
out there feel the same way?


regards,
--chris

ps: adios (<A HREF="http://dc.qut.edu.au/adios/adios-bootcd.html">http://dc.qut.edu.au/adios/adios-bootcd.html</A>)seemed suitable
as well, though i could  not find a package list detailing what all it
includes, though it seems to include a lot!

pps: it really only makes sense that there would be a suse live cd for
this purpose at some point... ;-)
