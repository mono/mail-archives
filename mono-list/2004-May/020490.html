I'm not concerned with lock in, or MSFT taking mono away, or Linux 
dying or anything technical like that. I'm concerned, and I think 
others should be as well, with ubiquity.

&gt;<i>

Ah. Justification for anticompetitive behavior. I'm sure Bill wished he 
had more of that sentiment in Europe recently.

&gt;<i> Worrying about your right choose

</I>&gt;<i> whether is be OS/2, Mac OS X, Solaris, Be, Irix, or a band new OS some

</I>&gt;<i> application, what direction do you want your product to go in, how can 
</I>&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;<i> improve the development cycle to release better products.
</I>
Well what if one of my features requires reading Exchanges calendaring 
stuff on Linux?Or how about playing movies in the latest windows media 
format? Or I want to write a Visio file manipulator?

&gt;<i> To me these seems
</I>&gt;<i> like things that should be worried about and to not be a paranoid

Indeed. Nothing worse trying to premise an argument based on an 
incorrect reading between the lines.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your example of a Stalin Soviet Union is way to on the extreme side 
</I>&gt;<i> and only
</I>&gt;<i> serves to provide drama.
</I>
I suppose it could be read that way, but drama was not what I was 
trying to create.

&gt;<i>   As I said earlier the nature of business is to
</I>&gt;<i> edge out your competitors as best you can.
</I>
Does the end in fact justify the means then?

&gt;<i> Grow, devour, grow, and devour,that's what business does.  It's just 
</I>&gt;<i> that no other business has be able to perform these actions as well or 
</I>&gt;<i> as easily as Microsoft has.  If Microsoft started killing babies I'd 
</I>&gt;<i> have to stop using it.  If a competitor goes
</I>&gt;<i> away, so what.
</I>
Oh my.
