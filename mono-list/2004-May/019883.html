<PRE>I'm not a Ximian guy, but I play on on TV!

OK, I don't, and in fact I have no affiliation with any of the groups
involved, but I can guess...

This appears to be a fairly common question.  The answer, last I heard,
was that they'd love to have Evolution run on Windows, but it's not a
priority (Evolution 2.0 is the current priority, followed by integration
with the Gnome desktop platform), so -- at present -- it would require
an external effort to port Evolution.

I'm not sure how hard this would be; it depends on how many X11-isms are
in Evolution and its dependent-libraries.

See Google for more information; &quot;evolution win32 port&quot; brought up some
interesting information.

&gt;<i> Any future plans of getting Evolution re-written as a mono application ?
</I>
Not likely, at least not at present.  Evolution is attempting to become
part of the Gnome desktop platform, and there seems to be a large
contingent of people who are dead set against any Mono dependency in
Gnome.

This may change in the future, but for *now* this appears to be the
case.  See the desktop-devel-list archives at mail.gnome.org.

&gt;<i> (or anyone know of a full Outlook+Exchange equivalent for win32 clients
</I>&gt;<i> any server ?)
</I>
Not that I know of.  LDAP+IMAP+any decent mail client (Thunderbird) is
often cited as a good-enough equivalent, but if you need Calendaring and
the whole combined package, I don't know of any equivalents.
