<PRE>There is a patch in CVS for mod_mono to work with multiple virtual hosts.  I
have not tested it out yet so I cannot give you any pointers on using it.

As far as the &quot;application&quot; goes, each ASP.NET page does not have to be part
of an application.  They can be served up in the same way php and perl can.
What an application allows you to do is actually build a web application in
much the same manner as you would go about writing a desktop application.
There is an optional global application file that can be used so multiple
pages in the application can share information with each other as well as
define tasks common to the application as a whole.

I hope that helps.

&gt;<i>Why is it a must to keep the asp.net pages in a so-called 'application'? I
</I>don't really understand what's meant by an application exactly...coz I am
used to writing php/perl CGIs, and seems that they don't have such concept.

&gt;<i>This idea annoys me because my apache is configured to serve mass virtual
</I>hosts dynamically. Usually for the perl/php case, I just need to map *.pl
*.php to their respective handler. But for the asp.net (or maybe even the
JSP as well?) I need to setup applications to handle the pages. Why is it
necessary to have applications? It sounds to me that it would be quite
troublesome to setup so many applications on the web server....

&gt;<i>By the way, would that imply that it is not sensible/possible to provide
</I>asp.net hosting service to a lot of users on a shared server if the
'application' restriction must apply? coz I might need to create thousands
of applications for them, which could add a lot of work load to me, and
causing the httpd.conf to grow very very big.

&gt;<i>Could anyone kindly give me some guidance on this matter?
</I>I'd appreciate your help!!
