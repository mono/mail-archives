<PRE>Gonzalo recently posted the patch for virtual hosts in mod_mono.  Thank
you!  I see that you included a sample.webapp file.  Can you tell me how
an httpd.conf file should look nowadays?  I have tried everything I can
think of, and I can't get the virtual hosts to work right.

I am trying virtual hosts that only differ by port number.  Below is a
sample of what I'm trying.  Every time, I see that mod-mono-server.exe
has been launched with only the --applications switch, not the
--appconfigdir switch.  With this configuration, I get the HTML
displayed as text in the browser.  Or with some other configurations
(like putting all the Mono directives inside each VirtualHost tag --
seems redundant), if the first page I hit is on :8081, then :8082
displays :8081's contents as well. =20

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  (code below)

&lt;VirtualHost *:8081&gt;
	DocumentRoot /home/Andrew/localweb/gerontology
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
&lt;VirtualHost *:8082&gt;
	DocumentRoot /home/Andrew/localweb/mfhd
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

AddHandler
MonoApplicationsConfigDir &quot;/usr/local/apache/conf/webapps&quot;
# The following line does not make sense any more, since it cannot
# possibly store all the info that is in the .webapp files,
# but because mod_mono aborts loading if it does not see it...
MonoApplications &quot;/:/home/Andrew/localweb/gerontology&quot;
#I know that SetHandler is shorter, but I prefer breaking it down:
AddHandler mono .aspx .ascx .asmx .asax .config
