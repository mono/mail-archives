<PRE>I'm trying to use an assembly that is licensed managed by Xheo. I've been
able
to compile a simple test application with mcs, and I have a valid temporary
key
in the local directory. However, when I try to run the test, the license
manager throws an exception because it cannot find a valid license. I have
also
tried to embed the license in my executable using -resource:runtime.lic as
suggested on the Xheo website, but this didn't help.

Of course, running under Mono is totally unsupported, so I don't really have
anywhere to go for official help. For Windows, Xheo supports probing for a
license, but beyond the current directory, everything is OS-specific
(including
the registry and a c:\Program Files location).

Does anyone have any experience with this?

Thanks,
-ed
