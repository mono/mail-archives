<PRE>I really have not been at all clear. I apologize. I don't care if MSFT 
tries to kill Mono. I don't think it can. I don't care of MSFT tries to 
kill Linux. I don't think it can.

MSFT realizes it's advantages through it's ubiquity. It maintains it's 
ubiquity through unfair means. Hiding APIs, gratuitously changing 
formats and protocols and so forth. When I was running Linux on a 
laptop a few years ago it was flat out impossible to participate in my 
companies calendaring things because the Exchange calendaring protocol 
is secret. I didn't choose Linux because I hate MSFT, I chose it 
because I write code and there is no better platform for coding than 
unix. Before this realization I didn't give a whit about MSFT and 
monopolies and so forth.

I suggest that broad adoption of the CLR tends to enhance or enable 
continuing MSFT ubiquity. I suggest that MSFT has used it's ubiquity in 
such a fashion as to make them an undesirable member of the development 
world I want to live in. One in which the free flow of information is 
more valuable than making more than enough money, where the best 
solution is what is sought and not the one which sells the most this 
quarter.

Accepting this the ethical question is, should MSFT be helped? 
Rejecting this terminates the discussion. I think rejecting the premise 
entirely though is an abdication of responsibility.

I'll stop now. I didn't realize how touchy this was.

</I>&gt;<i> There are way too many factors for microsoft to overcome to kill mono

</I>&gt;<i> First - there is no single entity that they can shut down, they would

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Secondly - as pathetic as the DoJ has been in doing anything remotely

</I>&gt;<i> still incur scrutiny from watchdogs if it attempted to do something so 
</I>&gt;<i> blatant as trying to kill competition from mono.  The EU might even

</I>&gt;<i> court of public opinion - industry pundits would have a field day 
</I>&gt;<i> sensationalising Microsofts blatant abuse of monopoly power (yet 
</I>&gt;<i> again).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thirdly - as Miguel pointed out - unfortunately most development 
</I>&gt;<i> scenarios are now patent encumbered already.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the end of the day - your taking a risk:
</I>&gt;<i> is it any bigger than using any other language ??(probably not)
