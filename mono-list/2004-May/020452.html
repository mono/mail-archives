<PRE>I've seen this problem was posted already on the list, but there were
no solutions.
When I run xsp by itself it works fine, but Apache/mod_mono doesn't,
I'm getting 503 - Service Temporarily Unavailable, and message from 
the subject in apache error-log.
I use latest beta1 runtime, xsp and mod_mono are compiled form cvs.
Anyone knows, what might be the reason of such behaviour?

regards,
artb.
