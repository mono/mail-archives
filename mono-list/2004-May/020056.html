<PRE>Hi

Mono newbie here! I have successfully installed mono 0.31 on Windows 2000 &amp;
XP using the setup program. Everything compiled fine. Just tried beta 1 on
clean Windows 2000/XP sessions and cannot run any assemblies.

All return &quot;cannot open assembly&quot; message, and mcs returns:

** (C:\Mono\lib\mono\1.0\mcs.exe:112): WARNING **: Could not find assembly
System, references from C:\Mono\lib\mono\1.0\mcs.exe (assemblyref_index=1)
     Major/Minor: 1,0
     Build:       5000,0
     Token:       b77a5c561934e089


Unhandled Exception: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set
to
an instance of an object

Am I doing something wrong or is there a genuine problem?

Another quick point, I am looking to embed Mono into our applications.
Currently we use VBscript to extend the products, but I am looking for
greater speed and we are about to go cross-platform onto Linux/Unix. Which
list is bets to ask questions about the embedding API on?

Thanks

Dave
