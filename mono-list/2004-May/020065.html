<PRE>Hi Joel

Well that fixed the mcs problem, but still can't run any assemblies, apart
from simple HelloWorld using System. Also mbas doesn't seem to have been
included which was what I wanted to investigate.

Do I need Cygwin or .Net installed now? Version 0.31 was very good out of
the box. This seems like a backwards step for Windows.

Thanks

Dave

I posted shortly before you. A temporary solution is to copy all the 
dll's in the GAC subdirectories into the lib directory. For me, the 
dll's were found under C:\Program Files\Mono\lib\mono\gac and I put them 
in C:\Program Files\Mono\lib. I used explorer's search to find them, the 
copy-pasted into the lib.
