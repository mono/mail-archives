Red Carpet.  Please, for the love of $DEITY, start with Red Carpet.

If your distro isn't supported, get one that is.  It will greatly
simplify life (both yours and ours), and will automagically handle RPM
dependency tracking, which would immediately solve the problems you
elude to below...

&gt;<i> Is there a page for Mono newbies?
</I>
At one point, the Mono Handbook would have been the &quot;Mono Newbies&quot;
resource.  Alas, the Handbook has become stale, though there is an
effort to bring it up to date.

</I>
This has been noted on multiple occasions.  Last I knew, someone had
volunteered to re-write the site, but that was over a month ago and I
haven't heard anything since.

This is why you use Red Carpet.  Or Apt.  Or Yum.  Or Up2date.  Or any
number of other existing package management programs.  You shouldn't be
manually dealing with packages anymore, not when virtually every distro
includes such tools by default.  They will find and install all required
dependencies for you, thus promoting the &quot;really advanced&quot; feelings. :-)
