This does belong there, but I will answer the question here.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> WebServices teams, great job!!!!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Thanks :)

&gt;<i> The issue was then I was getting MD installed. It turns out that MD requires 
</I>&gt;<i> xterm to be on the machine, because that's what gets called when I hit 
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;execute&quot; button on the MD main menu.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While Mandrake installed xterm always in the XFree86-contrib package, they 
</I>&gt;<i> stopped doing it in 9.2 and are not shipping xterm in 10.0 at all, in favor of 
</I>&gt;<i> kvt/konsole, gnome-terminal and rxvt. So, I couldn't get MD to execute any of 
</I>&gt;<i> my freshly built executables. The error I was getting was non-descriptive, so 
</I>&gt;<i> until I started grepping through the source code, I had no idea what the 
</I>&gt;<i> problem was.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
the problem using gnome-terminal (as was the original behaviour) was
that it doesnt properly pass on your environment to child processes, so
if you required a MONO_PATH, PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc setup to run
mono properly, you would lose that with execute, with an even more
cryptic (and completely unsolvable) error message.

Hopefully before too long we will be able to get the VTE widget
embedding working properly, and it will be handled inside MD instead of
using an external process. Until then however, the current setup is what
we have to work with.

&gt;<i> Isn't there a way to use gconf-shap (which ships with gtk-sharp) to figure out 
</I>&gt;<i> which application is set up to be the default terminal app, and use it, instead 
</I>&gt;<i> of xterm?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just a question/wish list entry.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>         Mark.
