How about where not to?

Like, maybe...

Is a bad idea.  

For future reference, the &quot;right&quot; thing to do here would be to take the
experiences your having right now trying to get mono to work for you,
and writing them down.  Use that as a starting point for a better
installation process, and submit that back to the project.  Take a stab
at using what you learn to rebuild the documents you refer to above.

You get what you give, my friend. :)

For what it's worth, the final part of your rant is easily resolved: try
installing the dependencies.  Or use a utility like apt, yum, or Red
Carpet to resolve them for you automatically.  

&gt;<i> My apologies for the rants.  I realize that they might offend some and will 
</I>&gt;<i> not likely generate good helpful responses to my question, but sometimes you 
</I>&gt;<i> just have to get crap off your chest.
</I>
I hear you.  Probably not in the same message as a request for aid, but
hey, to each their own.

Adam
