	Because some of the uses that I intend to use mono for do not involve a 
corporation, it's just fun projects.   I am not a lawyer, nor do I have time 
or money to worry about it, so a clear and definitive answer would be nice.   
Sometimes trying to reach such an answer involves discussion.

	Note that I am not really that worried about it, but on the other hand I am 
worried just a bit and would like to have it more settled.   And obviously 
others also have some concerns.

&gt;<i> We do not know anything about this, because we are developers, not lawyers.
</I>&gt;<i> So, as we know nothing about legal issues, why are we over and over again
</I>&gt;<i> discussing these?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Living in the Netherlands (EU), I just cannot comprehend all the time that
</I>&gt;<i> is put into these discussions.

</I>&gt;<i> No offense to anyone, but plz let's start coding again and leave these
</I>&gt;<i> discussions to people who get paid to do these.
