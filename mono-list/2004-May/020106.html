<PRE>Hi!

First of all: Thanks for making Mono-beta-1 possible!

Being not very familiar with Linux, I tried to install the Beta 1 today. 
I afraid, I sort-of failed and thought that this report might be 
interesting for you...

I'm running Fedora Core 1 with Gnome 2.4. I used yum (su'd to root, 
entered &quot;yum -y update&quot;) to update my system.

I added the URL shown at &quot;for YUM, please use&quot; to my yum.conf, 
immitating the format of the other entries. Seemed to work... Then I 
looked for additional instructions on your website but didn't find them. 
  So I tried &quot;yum update&quot; but that didn't work.  I tried &quot;yum upgrade&quot; 
but that didn't work either.  Okay, that's my problem not really knowing 
yum, but  still, it would be helpful to get the right instructions to enter.

Next try: I used &quot;yum install *mono*&quot; and it started to download rpms 
but eventually failed to download &quot;wine 20040408-1fc1winehq.athlon&quot;. 
(Looks like somehow my system adds an &quot;athlon&quot; where you've i386).

Next try: I used &quot;yum -y install mono-core* mono-run*&quot; and eventually 
every other package listed on 
<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/beta1/fedora-1-i386/">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/beta1/fedora-1-i386/</A> to download and 
install the stuff one by one.  Could be more comfortable for my taste.

It's a bit irritating that the mysql support - the only db driver I'm 
interested in - has not a mono prefix.  I don't care that anybody else 
did that, it would be nice if the naming would be more consistent. 
Unfortunately, I can't install that package, because that requires again 
the wine-package (why does a db driver need mono-window-forms?).

Last but not least, I'd love to try out mono-develop but do not want to 
install a tar ball. The monodevelop webpage says that perhaps (if I'm 
lucky) there might be a package for my linux distribution but I didn't 
find one.  Seems, that I'll have to be patient :)

Question: Is it save to install both mono-core and mono-preview? 
Actually, I'm most interested in the C# 2.0 language with generics, 
comparing it to Java 1.5.


bye
