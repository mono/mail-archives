<PRE>I would go to Mono's download page and look for the Mono release you
installed:

<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/download.html">http://www.go-mono.com/download.html</A>

Look for XSP and mod_mono tarballs that go along with that release.  You
will have to build Mod_mono and xsp yourself.

Subject: [Mono-list] intro


Hello... I just joined this list, and thought I'd write a brief intro
message.  Apologies in advance if this is out of line. (I couldn't
locate a &quot;list charter&quot;)

I'm interested in C# and ASP.NET out of technical curiousity / hacking
instinct and also out of desire to keep abreast of technology for the
sake of my career.  Since I will not likely be able to use .NET in my
job in the near future, my plan is to use it instead for development on
a web site I manage on a volunteer basis for a non-profit organization.

I am hosting the site through &quot;linode.com&quot; which provides me with a
Linux VPS (virtual private server), which I'm finding quite exciting
since it gives me full control (root access) of my &quot;virtual server&quot; at
quite a low cost to the organization.  The organization also gives me
pretty much a free hand in how I develop the site (one of the advantages
of working for free :). I have Debian/woody and apache running on my
server (although other distros are possible if I would want to rebuild
the server).

So I figure Mono is the perfect match between my .NET learning goals and
my hosting situation.  Since I have root access I can install whatever I
want, so why not use &quot;mod-mono&quot; for my server-based processing needs?
As of now, my site sticks with straight HTML, although there are
definite possibilities for going further.

So far I have installed mono using the stable (woody) debian package at
<A HREF="http://www.debianplanet.org/mono">http://www.debianplanet.org/mono</A> and succussfully compiled and run a
&quot;hello world&quot; console program (yay!).  However, I have not yet figured
out how to
install the apache module &quot;mod-mono&quot; for &quot;woody&quot;.   (It does not seem to
be
available at debianplanet).

I'd appreciate any assistance on installing mod-mono, as well as any
general comments and suggestions regarding my plans, including links to
introductory resources such as Howtos and tutorials.
