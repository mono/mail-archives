<PRE>&gt;<i> I know that the real solution is for the vm engines to allow the code t=
</I>o
&gt;<i> deployed pre-compiled. But they do not allow that because of safety rea=
</I>sons.
&gt;<i> Besides its a war against closed source, but I personally wouldn't mind=
</I> my
&gt;<i> company makes everything opensource.
</I>
Pre-compiled things is a big regression from VMs. And=20
reverse-engeenering is also possible with compiled code, just harder.

&gt;<i> The question, is how would it make money? We would have to develop for =
</I>free?
&gt;<i> How could we compete with companys that download our own code for free?=
</I>

&gt;<i> Besides that would make us very vulnerable to software pattents.
</I>

&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> Its very fun to talk about opensource when you have lots of money to de=
</I>velop
&gt;<i> and then make the same prices as your competition. If you do that, of c=
</I>ourse
&gt;<i> the clients will want you because you did it, but if you can't you are
</I>&gt;<i> simply doomed.
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> I know that I'm going to get very unpopular in the open source comunity=
</I> for
&gt;<i> this, but leaving the hate asside, you know that open source gets their=
</I>
&gt;<i> money from somewere as does comercial software, you might have your ene=
</I>mies
&gt;<i> but, they aren't all the companies who produce comercial software, as s=
</I>ome
&gt;<i> of they also help open source.
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> If you get me the money, I'll give you some very nice open source thing=
</I>s
&gt;<i> that we are developing, but the thing is you don't.
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> The solution for the moment is to have critical code on our servers onl=
</I>y.
&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> Besides Obfuscation only works when you are up against a SME, even if y=
</I>ou
&gt;<i> are up agains a hacker, he will reverse it, he will start from the
</I>&gt;<i> dependecies and eat the code all the way with a simple dependecy graph,=
</I>
&gt;<i> everybody knows it, but the companies believes obfuscation protects the=
</I>m.
&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> I know the evil company is planning on a secure execution enverionment =
</I>that
&gt;<i> would protected software and company, yup that would be just a another
</I>&gt;<i> DVD/IPod contest. As nothing can stop a guy with to much time on their
</I>&gt;<i> hands.
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> I guess that the only real solution is to pre-compile the code, for eve=
</I>ry
&gt;<i> plataform you plan on deploying, but neither mono or ms allow that. You=
</I>
&gt;<i> still have to feed the assembly.
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> I know assembly code isn't safer too, yes its true, but the cost of
</I>&gt;<i> disassembling it is most of the times more, than the cost of buying or
</I>&gt;<i> redoing it.
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> Chears...
</I>&gt;<i> Jos=E9 Faria
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>There is of course commercial .NET and Java software to consider. For
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>commercial software to be viable, there must be some restriction on use=
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i>beyond
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>a paper license agreement. In these cases, the Xheo option (for Windows=
</I>) or
&gt;&gt;<i>FlexLM work quite well. While in the end they really just keep honest
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;<i> people
</I>&gt;<i>=20
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>honest, it is solid piece of mind that your commercial product isn't go=
</I>ing
&gt;&gt;<i>to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>be distributed ad hoc all over the world.
