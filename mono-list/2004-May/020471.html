Would you have accepted a technology that, say, reduced processor heat 
by 2 orders of magnitude (whatever) from, say, Stalin's soviet union 
knowing what you know now about that mass murdering government?

I think the question at hand is not, or at least should not be, about 
what is practical. The CLR (or .NET if you'd prefer) is pretty sweet no 
doubt about it. There is an ethical question regards adopting a MS 
technology that will help MS. MS is not friendly to my ability to 
choose. Enhancing their position in any way offers them increasing 
potential to diminish my ability to choose.

This is not silly or over the top. Caution is required here and the 
development (not linux) world needs to make sure it is protecting it's 
environment lest we wake up one morning and discover the rain forest 
gone, the ozone depleted and a requirement to wear #40 sunblock to go 
for a walk.
