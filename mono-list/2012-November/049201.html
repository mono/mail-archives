<PRE>
I'm investigating Mono as a possible solution for porting a Windows
Forms based app to OS X.

As a test, I've created a small C# app.  The Main form contains a button
which invokes another window with the following code in the _Click() event:

Form2 f2 = new Form2();
f2.ShowDialog();
f2.Dispose();

Form2 has a button which just calls &quot;Close();&quot;

No other real code in the test app.

I'm running into problems on a Mac OS X Lion (10.7.5) computer, I've
installed/tested the app against Mono SDK 2.10.9 and 3.0.1.  I've also
tried binaries compiled with MonoDevelop (3.0.5) as well as one from VS
2010.

Testing involves clicking Form1's Button #1 (to show Form2) and Button
#2 (on Form 2) to close Form2.  Clicking these buttons over and over
eventually causes the mono app to bring up 3 to 5 simultaneous Form2s.
The &quot;topmost&quot; Form2 is the normal one w/ default coloring and Button #2.
 However, the underneath dialogs are &quot;blank&quot; windows w/ a white
background and no layout of any kind for Button #2.  You cannot even
close these forms w/ the &quot;X&quot; close button.

After this occurs, if I close Form1, the mono process hangs, and Ctrl-C
is req'd to kill the process.

Also, the following is displayed in the shell which launched the app:

user$ mono WindowsFormsMonoTest.exe
Nov 27 18:35:16 comp-lion.local mono[210] &lt;Error&gt;:
kCGErrorInvalidConnection: CGSGetWindowTags: Invalid connection
Nov 27 18:35:16 comp-lion.local mono[210] &lt;Error&gt;: kCGErrorFailure: Set
a breakpoint @ CGErrorBreakpoint() to catch errors as they are logged.
^C

Has anyone seen this before?  Seems like a simple case which should work
under Mac OS X.  Can anyone suggest possible solutions?  Is it a
mismatch between X11 and/or GTK versions and Mono?  Any other
possibilities?  BTW, I have the sample source if anyone would like to
see this firsthand.

TIA,
Jeff Clausius
