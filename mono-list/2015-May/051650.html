<PRE>Hi Edward,
Thank you first for your detailed answer.

You wrote:
&quot;So the big questions are - What do you want to accomplish? Are you planning to develop mono sources and contribute to mono? Or do you just want to learn mono and start doing cross-platform stuff like you were doing on .Net with VS?&quot;

Actually I simply want to make run on a Mac a WCF Service Windows Forms client application I just developed with VS on Windows. 

The WCF (duplex) service is hosted on iis and the clients normally run on Windows but I have some Mac  workstations on which I would need to be able to run the WCF client. I thought this was possible with mono and just wanted to try that.

I do not intend to develop nor compile my app on the Mac/mono. I just want to deploy and run the already compiled WCF Winforms client .exe app with its WCF config file to consume the WCF service.

Thank you to let me know if there is any chance to succeed and how. Actually, when a tried to run my client on mono I got the same error message than I got when I tried to run the little hello Winforms test app: Unable to find some dynamic linked library of the mono framework. But these files appear to be correctly installed...

Thanks again.
Pierre-Fran&#231;ois aka Chip
