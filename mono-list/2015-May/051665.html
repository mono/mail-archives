<PRE>Just as a comment, we have been using mono for the past 8 years and our app
is very well spilt between client(gui) and backend server with all the
client build on windows only and all the backend server compiled on windows
and mono on Linux and we have about 3 to 4 million lines of back end code
with over 20000 test all running on both windows and Linux and  99% of it
without change. there are a few areas that are platform specific that need
to be addressed but for the most part everything compiles and running and
runs on Linux and windows without change. The key is to have a solid split
between client(gui) and backend server since the gui is something that you
would have thats specific to the platform you are working on, either be  it
be windows, Linux,ios,android.... and the server can be designed to be cross
platform and communicate between the client and the server through remoting
which for the most part  crosses between the windows and Linux/mono world
with little problem although wcf could also be used . Like a said we are
almost 4 million lines of code into it and so far its been working but you
have to think about this right at start and cant look at it down the road in
the project. Just an observation anyhow.

thanks

scott
