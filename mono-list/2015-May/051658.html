</I>VS2015 is Visual Studio, bunch of code in c++ and still using COM 
technology, so this will not be ported to anything different from 
Windows soon.
VS team cannot solve 256 length paths and VS is still 64b app (there are 
some 64b parts talking to 32b VS).

VS Code is editor based on Atom (git atom core) and it runs on Ubuntu 
and Fedora (presonally tested, currently preparing tests on SuSE).
If you watch //BUILD talk about ASP.net (Hanselman) you'll notice that 
there are no plans to make new Visual Studio on Mac and Linux.
VS Code is merely editor based on javascript talking to server 
(omnisharp) to get intellisense and autocompletion + few integrations 
with system to enable commandline commands and debugging.
&gt;<i> I wonder how long mono is for this world?
</I>
Mono is here since 2001 and will stay for some time for sure...

thanks

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Oh, you should give up now. There is no chance of simply taking a complex app already built and developed in VS/Windows, and then straight up launching it under mono on a different platform and expecting it to work. Also if you check the mono compatibility page, it says &quot;limited WCF&quot; which may or may not affect you. I don't know if &quot;limited WCF&quot; compatibility affects server-side, client-side, or both.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In reality, if you want to develop cross-platform, you can achieve &gt; 95% code reuse, and binary compatibility across platforms, but it's not going to happen automatically except for trivial apps or libraries. You have to develop and test with that goal in mind. You need VS on windows, and XS/MD on mac and/or linux. And you need to test on every platform that you care about supporting. There *will* be differences in the OS, as well as differences between .Net and mono, which you'll have to workaround.
