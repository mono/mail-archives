Is that just a blatant troll? Even with .Net being open source, you cannot ever expect it to simply compile straight up, on a non-windows platform. Lots of changes are required under the hood to implement things like file and socket operations, which are fundamentally based on different underlying technologies. You should not expect such an effort to ever be done - because it's already been done in mono, and there's no motivation for anyone to repeat all that work in a separate project.

So the long and short of it is: You should expect mono to adopt the .Net source code rapidly, and therefore mono is and will continue to be indefinitely, the canonical way of running .Net code on non-windows platforms.

It just so happens, VS is better than XS/MD in a lot of ways... But XS/MD is also better than VS in a few ways. Particularly, I don't think you should ever expect VS to build a Xam.Mac project, and in VS, if you want interactive code analysis you have to pay for Resharper. But that capability is built-in to XS/MD.

Personally I like to edit code in both XS/MD, and VS, so I can take advantage of the strengths of each.
