You get it right, almost.

1. You have to run mono --aot MyApp.exe on OSX once after every update 
of the .exe file.  This will give you MyApp.exe.so file which is a 
native OSX binary.

2. After that run your application as usual: mono MyApp.exe (no .so 
suffix).  If everything worked right, mono will notice that .so file and 
use it instead of JIT-ing the .exe assembly.

</I>
I believe you need Xcode to do this.  Other option might be using 
macports to pull only binutils package, but now that you mention no 
experience on Linux/OSX your best bet is using Xcode.
