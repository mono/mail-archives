Something immediately strikes me as wrong: you're mixing GTK# and
Windows.Forms. In your earlier message, I thought this was a WinForms app.
You need to pick one or the other. :)

However, note that Mono / MonoDevelop doesn't have a WinForms designer. So,
if you want to use a GUI designer, either use WinForms on Visual Studio /
SharpDevelop (your exe will still work with Mono), or use GTK# on
MonoDevelop (note that GTK# apps will require an extra 8MB installation to
run on Windows).

Good luck!

</I>&gt;<i> Hello Everyone,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Last night, I posted a thread about a problem I was having with
</I>&gt;<i> Application.Exit(). Now, after working with it a bit more, I'm starting to
</I>&gt;<i> wonder if it's actually a bug. So I'm going to ask if anyone can confirm
</I>&gt;<i> this behavior as a bug or clarify if I am misunderstanding something.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here are the details:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When I create a new Gtk# application, it creates the skeleton application
</I>&gt;<i> for me complete with a MainWindows.cs file that contains basic skeleton
</I>&gt;<i> code. In that code, there is the following method:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> protected void OnDeleteEvent (object sender, DeleteEventArgs a)
</I>&gt;<i> 	{
</I>&gt;<i> 		Application.Quit();
</I>&gt;<i> 		a.RetVal = true;
</I>&gt;<i> 	}
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, this code handles closing the form when the &quot;X&quot; is clicked at the
</I>&gt;<i> top, if I remember correctly. Now, that works fine even though,
</I>&gt;<i> technically the Quit() method isn't part of the Application object. It
</I>&gt;<i> just works. I don't know why. Add to that I can use Application.Quit()
</I>&gt;<i> anywhere else in the application and it immediately will quit the
</I>&gt;<i> application.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, I add a reference to System.Windows.Forms and the corresponding
</I>&gt;<i> 'using System.Windows.Forms;' statement and it all breaks!  Suddenly, the
</I>&gt;<i> compiler starts to complain that 'The name Application doesn't exist in
</I>&gt;<i> the current context' and it catches all of my Application.Quit()
</I>&gt;<i> statements.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, I change these to Application.Exit() (the correct .NET statement) and
</I>&gt;<i> THAT fails too. In fact, the ONLY thing that works is if I use the full
</I>&gt;<i> System.Windows.Forms.Application.Exit(). However, if I add that statement
</I>&gt;<i> to the OnDeleteEvent() method, nothing happens.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The bottom line is I cannot quit my application and I can find no way
</I>&gt;<i> around it. This seems like a bug for a few reasons:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Application.Quit() works until I add the System.Windows.Forms
</I>&gt;<i> reference.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Application.Exit() doesn't work unless the entire path is specified,
</I>&gt;<i> without fail.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is this indeed a bug or am I missing something vital here?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks in Advance. I'm really trying to understand Mono as I come from a
</I>&gt;<i> Visual Studio background but I'm having absolutely no luck with this
</I>&gt;<i> issue.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank You,
</I>&gt;<i> Anthony Papillion
</I>&gt;<i>
