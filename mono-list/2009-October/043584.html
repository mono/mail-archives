If you're running linux, you can run the 'monodoc' program and edit and
submit documentation from within it.

(Granted, it's a terrible editing experience, but it does work.)

&gt;<i> so the question is why there is no wiki for mono
</I>&gt;<i> project ?
</I>
There is a wiki (mono-project.com is all wiki), but (1) class library
documentation is not stored there, and (2) editing is restricted because
we're afraid of people ruining our pages.  (Yes, their changes could be
easily undone, but we'd still need to be on the lookout, and if a page
were changed we'd likely need to be told it was changed in an
undesirable fashion.)

&gt;<i> Are you afraid of copy/paste from MSDN ?
</I>
Yes.  We've noticed numerous attempts at copying directly from MSDN via
the monodoc submission mechanism.  The fact that we need to manually do
this documentation checking also slows down the process.

In summary, copy/pasting from MSDN isn't just a theoretical concern,
it's an actual one, and given the size of the framework it's usually
easier to just hit MSDN directly (for BCL types).  Mono-specific types
should be documented in svn (using mdoc(5) XML), so updating those docs
is easily done for anyone with commit access, and those are periodically
synced with the website.
