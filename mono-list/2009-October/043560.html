As others have mentioned, COM is native code.  Mono has some support for
invoking COM code [0], but you can't take a COM component written for
Windows and run it as-is under Linux (just as you can't take any Windows
app and run it as-is under Linux).

What you might be able to do is install Wine, install Mono for Windows
within Wine, install your COM components within Wine, and see if your
app works that way.  Then everything thinks it's running on Windows, so
it might actually work.
