<PRE>
I don't want to stir up a hornets nest. It is my intent to see Mono as a
strong enough offering to be able to recommend medium to large companies to
commit to an Open technology stack that includes (and relies on) Mono.
Forgive me if I am not well informed, I am definitely well intended.

The following are issues that stop this from reaching any sort of reality:
1) There is no visible Mono timeline and release plan. What is Mono's intent
and stated goals for the future? Will it try to maintain parity with
Microsoft Dot.Net to some level, and if so what level and by what time-line?
  1.1) What are mono's resources?
  1.2) Who are mono's sponsors?
  1.3) Are we resourcing up to maintain pace with our plans?

2) Many projects that should be enablers of achieving a reasonably parity
with Microsoft Dot.Net have not been updated since Dec 2008 (such as Olive)
If these are no longer strategic the thinking behind this should be made
transparent.

3) The mono site has a mix of outdated pages statuses and some (very little)
new content. I agree that the code is more important than the site, but it
is less than professional to not date each page edit and structure the site
so that the latest status and pages are always guaranteed to be clear and
navigable. Please fix this.

4) Is mono executing the best strategy (as in - what is best for Mono and
the Open Source community) by relying on Mono-Develop? Could we not
implement (or at least explore) mono on Eclipse or Netbeans IDE's and
concentrate our efforts instead on integrating to a fully mature IDE
infrastructure instead of developing YAIDE from scratch without a snow-balls
hope in hades of keeping up with the other IDE's? Just a thought. I suggest
that the Mono-Project look into the other IDE's, it wont slow down
Mono-Develop any and more choice would be good here.

Thoughts? Ideas? Comments?
