<PRE>
Mono is alive and kicking. Other than the number of posts here and on
monologue (<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/monologue/">http://www.go-mono.com/monologue/</A>), which clearly shows Mono is
nowhere near dead (unlike, say, dotGNU), the gap between Mono 2.0 (last
year) and Mono 2.6 speaks volume about how fast things are moving.

1) I take it you saw roadmap? <A HREF="http://mono-project.com/Roadmap">http://mono-project.com/Roadmap</A>
As far as I know, other than WPF, pretty much everything in .NET is planned
for implementation in Mono.
The class status page (<A HREF="http://go-mono.com/status/">http://go-mono.com/status/</A>) is also interesting,
although it doesn't tell you about future goals.
I believe Miguel said about a dozen of Novell devs worked on Mono (+
contributors), I don't know much other than that.

2-3) I agree about the lack of updated content / documentation... I believe
Olive (or part of it?) was merged with the main Mono branch at some point,
but I don't know the details.

4) I'd pick MonoDevelop over Eclipse, personally. Although less mature,
MonoDevelop is lighter and faster, and has just the features I need. It just
needs to be polished some more (stability improvements, bugs fixing, OS
parity by, for example, adding debugger support for everything on every
OS...). MonoDevelop has been worked on for years, and with the relatively
recent additions of debugging + Windows and OSX support, I guess the bulk of
the work has already been done. If MonoDevelop had only just been started, I
may agree with you, but MonoDevelop is there right now and already works
fine.
That said, that doesn't prevent Eclipse-enthusiasts from looking into Mono
with Eclipse, but I don't think Novell should bother at this point.

All of that said, few companies use (or even know) about Mono... which is a
shame. Hope that ends up changing.

</I>&gt;<i> made transparent.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) The mono site has a mix of outdated pages statuses and some (very
</I>&gt;<i> little) new content. I agree that the code is more important than the
</I>&gt;<i> site, but it is less than professional to not date each page edit and
</I>&gt;<i> structure the site so that the latest status and pages are always
</I>&gt;<i> guaranteed to be clear and navigable. Please fix this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Is mono executing the best strategy (as in - what is best for Mono and
</I>&gt;<i> the Open Source community) by relying on Mono-Develop? Could we not
</I>&gt;<i> implement (or at least explore) mono on Eclipse or Netbeans IDE's and
</I>&gt;<i> concentrate our efforts instead on integrating to a fully mature IDE
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure instead of developing YAIDE from scratch without a
</I>&gt;<i> snow-balls hope in hades of keeping up with the other IDE's? Just a
</I>&gt;<i> thought. I suggest that the Mono-Project look into the other IDE's, it
</I>&gt;<i> wont slow down Mono-Develop any and more choice would be good here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thoughts? Ideas? Comments?
