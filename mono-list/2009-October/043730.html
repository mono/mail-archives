</I>
Mono's roadmap is available here: <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Roadmap">http://www.mono-project.com/Roadmap</A>

In general, Mono is currently aiming to maintain parity with .Net 3.5 
SP1, minus WPF and WF.

This means Mono currently supports:
- System.Core
- LINQ
- C# 3.0
- Some WCF

on top of almost everything in .Net 1.1/2.0.

We will continue working on filling in any remaining gaps in our .Net 
3.5 coverage.

&gt;<i> 2) Many projects that should be enablers of achieving a reasonably parity
</I>&gt;<i> with Microsoft Dot.Net have not been updated since Dec 2008 (such as Olive)
</I>&gt;<i> If these are no longer strategic the thinking behind this should be made
</I>&gt;<i> transparent.
</I>
&gt;<i> 3) The mono site has a mix of outdated pages statuses and some (very little)
</I>&gt;<i> new content. I agree that the code is more important than the site, but it
</I>&gt;<i> is less than professional to not date each page edit and structure the site
</I>&gt;<i> so that the latest status and pages are always guaranteed to be clear and
</I>&gt;<i> navigable. Please fix this.
</I>
Yes, our website is sadly out of date.

&gt;<i> 4) Is mono executing the best strategy (as in - what is best for Mono and
</I>&gt;<i> the Open Source community) by relying on Mono-Develop? Could we not
</I>&gt;<i> implement (or at least explore) mono on Eclipse or Netbeans IDE's and
</I>&gt;<i> concentrate our efforts instead on integrating to a fully mature IDE
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure instead of developing YAIDE from scratch without a snow-balls
</I>&gt;<i> hope in hades of keeping up with the other IDE's? Just a thought. I suggest
</I>&gt;<i> that the Mono-Project look into the other IDE's, it wont slow down
</I>&gt;<i> Mono-Develop any and more choice would be good here.
</I>
MonoDevelop is already a very mature IDE (code completion, refactoring, 
gtk designer, visual debugging, etc.).  Throwing it all away and 
starting from scratch on integrating into an existing IDE would probably 
set us back a couple of years to regain feature parity with what we have 
now.

MonoDevelop is also a great application for dogfooding Mono and GTK#, so 
we can find and fix issues.
