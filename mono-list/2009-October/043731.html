<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; 4) Is mono executing the best strategy (as in - what is best for Mono and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the Open Source community) by relying on Mono-Develop? Could we not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implement (or at least explore) mono on Eclipse or Netbeans IDE's and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; concentrate our efforts instead on integrating to a fully mature IDE
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; infrastructure instead of developing YAIDE from scratch without a snow-balls
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hope in hades of keeping up with the other IDE's? Just a thought. I suggest
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that the Mono-Project look into the other IDE's, it wont slow down
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mono-Develop any and more choice would be good here.
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop is already a very mature IDE (code completion, refactoring, 
</I>&gt;<i> gtk designer, visual debugging, etc.).
</I>
Ditto,  MD is a excellent, fast, and stable.   I develop in both Python
and C# in MD and it is a great pleasure to work with/in

&gt;<i> MonoDevelop is also a great application for dogfooding Mono and GTK#, so 
</I>&gt;<i> we can find and fix issues.
</I>
Also I'd imagine building a .NET Gtk# designer in a Java IDE might not
be a bucket of fun.
