Well, the tarball that we distribute is from `make dist' whereas the
tarball from svn is just a tarball of whats there. In general, the
experience of compiling from svn tarball will be the same as from svn
itself.

One helpful hint:
        Try either building a 1.1.x tarball or installing an rpm of mono
        and then doing the svn checkout, and installing to a prefix.
        This is by far the easiest way to build mono at any time. In
        fact, in my build system (which is what makes the tarballs) this
        is pretty much exactly what gets done.

I also happen to be making rpm and tarball snapshots of the tree fairly
often these days. On <A HREF="http://primates.ximian.com/~bmaurer">http://primates.ximian.com/~bmaurer</A> there may be
mono-1.1.7.99.XXXX.tar.gz files. These are tarballs from svn as of
revision XXXX. There are also rpms on there. This is not a service I am
promising to keep up though (but if there is enough demand, I could
probably do it once a week or something).

We are also working on setup that will do automated rpm and tarball
builds. But that is not going to be ready for a bit.
