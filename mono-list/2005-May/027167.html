<PRE>Back onto point a bit here. I have noticed a couple recurring trends.

#1) People who use the installer, and not the rpms, and then install
gtk# 1.9.5 into a *different* prefix than the installer, and then
install MD seem to have the most issues. To me, and Daniel can correct
me if I am wrong, but it seems that people using the installer don't
seem to understand that if you don't install mono stuff into the same
prefix as mono, you need to mung things like MONO_GAC_PATH and
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc. Maybe this is something that should be put into
some sort of HOWTO for the installer.

#2) People assume that MD not loading with the DllNotFoundException are
related to MD. That is just not the case. Any application that actually
attempting to use those libraries would die the same way. MonoDevelop
just happens to be a non-toy application, so it exposes the issues in
your setup right away.

I would recommend for people who are having issues installing
MonoDevelop look into how their mono prefix and gtk# prefixes are setup,
as that seems to be the #1 cause of all of these problems. Mixing RPMS
w/ tarballs w/ installers is not something that should be done lightly
and indiscriminately.
