</I>I can see your problem, Carl.  It's tempting, isn't it, to say that it 
shouldn't be this way, but I think Adam made a good point about the 
maturity of monodevelop.  Perhaps we shouldn't expect too much too 
soon.  But I do hope that Novell (who I don't think are directly 
responsible for monodevelop, by the way) are listening and put some 
serious work into helping the monodevelop team get things sorted out.  
Maybe they already are.

As to your other problem, I use separate data access objects (remote 
objects as it happens) that are called from the presentation layer.  The 
developer can therefore ensure that something sensible is returned from 
the call and decide what to do about it - like putting up an error page, 
or whatever.  It's not too hard, so if you're interested in knowing more 
please feel free to contact me off-list and I'll give you what help I can.

Cheers

Peter
