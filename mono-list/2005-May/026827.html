<PRE>Mono still does not Install Friendly for new Users.

Now there is a MonoInstaller binary that install Mono in all Linux systems.

I've try that in Fedora Core3 and something went wrong. I had do install it from
RPM.

Not I'm on Ubuntu and I've installed using apt-get and did not try use it.

Even try to install the aplication developed in Mono have a glitch. First time
I've try to install F-Spot ... ohhh my god... i had some problem with a gtk2
package. Of course this is not good for end users that know Window$ and now, to
install a application ... Click ..click .. click and it's done.

I think that in the future, with the repository of applications (apt-get, yum,
emerge, urpmi, etc) this problem will not be a problem. The developers will
have to choose the dependency and the repository manager will do the rest.... I
think.

Let's wait for the future.

&gt;<i> I don't know if its me, but I've had endless problems trying to get
</I>&gt;<i> Monodevelop 0.6 onto my SUSE 9.3.
</I>&gt;<i> In my little or short-time of using Mono, in the Linux environment,
</I>&gt;<i> I've found it a bit of a mountain to install. SUSE 9.2 as I remember
</I>&gt;<i> was an almost breeze for mono 1.0, but from then on its been hectic.
</I>&gt;<i> I've come recognise that like most things in life. the go-mono site,
</I>&gt;<i> is not altogether straightforward, with the endless dependency
</I>&gt;<i> requirements that exist. By in large, I am not complaining, being in
</I>&gt;<i> Linux for years, has left me a very wily hacker, however my concern
</I>&gt;<i> stems for new users. My point is, Mono has a 4-year history, and its
</I>&gt;<i> simply beautiful, but for new users to Mono, the initial adoption
</I>&gt;<i> phase is outweighed by the learning-curse, and barriers-to-entry in
</I>&gt;<i> just getting it installed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The new single binary, does make life easier, however, in both suse
</I>&gt;<i> 9.2 and suse 9.3, my Monodevelop has just kept crashing, after
</I>&gt;<i> creating a project, without an error. Now being a somewhat lazy
</I>&gt;<i> enduser, I should be hacking away to figure out the point of failure,
</I>&gt;<i> but again, my concern is for the new users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyways, after all this ranting, I have decided to write some
</I>&gt;<i> documentation on how to install and configure Mono, cause its just not
</I>&gt;<i> simply, rpm -Uvh / configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install. I'm sure you
</I>&gt;<i> guys are well aware of this, but really and I guess emotionally I say
</I>&gt;<i> this, its a MISSION.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/end ranting&gt;
