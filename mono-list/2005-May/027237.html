<PRE>My first post to this list. :-)

My setup:

 Linux machine with mono 1.0 where I run my client.

 Windows machine with a web service running on .Net. Accessing the web
 service requires NTLM authentication (HTTP way).

I've managed to find a proxy that can handle the NTLM authentication for
HTTP, but I can't get mono to use it as a proxy (adding
proxyaddress=&quot;localhost:5865&quot; and bypassonlocalhost=&quot;false&quot; doesn't
work). I know the proxy works (verified with wget downloading the WSDL
for the service :-).

I've written a few test clients for other web services, that aren't
hidden behind NTLM, so I'm confident my code is OK.

My questions:

 Is proxy support proper in mono 1.0 or do I have to leave the Ubuntu
 packages of mono 1.0 and install mono 1.1?

 Is there some other (better?) way of handling the silly NTLM
 authentication? (Turning it off is not an option, unfortunately!)

Software is not manufactured, it is something you write and publish.
Keep Europe free from software patents, we do not want censorship
by patent law on written works.

Cryptography, at least in its public embodiment, is finally, slowly,
and painfully becoming a science. Part of that evolution is the
dawning of an understanding of exactly what cryptographic guarantees
mean, and how delicate they can be. I think it's safe to say that not
a single *cryptographic* claim made in any paper published before, oh,
1985 or so (perhaps even as late as 1990) could be fully justified
today. (Of course, the better work was usually *almost* correct, but
the theoretical underpinning was simply not there to even state the
claims in a way that could be properly formalized.)
