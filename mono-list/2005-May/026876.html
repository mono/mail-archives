&gt;<i> I've finally managed to install MD after ~12 hours of work. It would
</I>&gt;<i> have taken me as little as 2 to 3 hours, if Mono and MD distribution
</I>&gt;<i> process was a bit more organized. I feel that the way you manage
</I>&gt;<i> documentation and releases needs urgent and full revision.
</I>
Mmm, installation is pretty easy once you know how to install mono.

Installation of mono is organzid enough I think: simply go to
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Downloads">http://www.mono-project.com/Downloads</A> and for fedora, choose a binary
or red carpet. 
It's a bit different from distribution to distribution.
(the windows install is even easier)

&gt;<i> but in the per-distro download
</I>&gt;<i> sections it offers the &quot;unstable&quot; 1.1.7, without mentioning it on the
</I>&gt;<i> main page. 
</I>
Yea, It's better to use 1.1.x series. Things wil change when version 1.2
is out (and later 2.0)

&gt;<i> That's why I didn't find the packages and spent so much time.
</I>&gt;<i> Ah yes, and the current version of gecko-sharp, linked from MonoDevelop
</I>&gt;<i> site (I think), is broken, its previous version doesn't work with MD,
</I>&gt;<i> while in the source control it is found under a different name
</I>&gt;<i> (gtkmozembed-sharp). Not to mention that the repository version is also
</I>&gt;<i> broken (as of today), but this one was easy to fix.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I don't know. On my Gentoo system, everything works fine.
On my second system (Ubuntu), I don't even try to install development
versions as I don't need them for only f-spot and muine ;)

&gt;<i> This was the worst installation experience I had in years. Not to
</I>&gt;<i> mention that, in the end, MonoDevelop 0.6 is still unusable. I think
</I>&gt;<i> this is the time to freeze feature development and direct all the effort
</I>&gt;<i> towards quality in code, documentation and repository.
</I>
I'm no developper of mono (I'm not good enough in programming yet ;)
but I don't think so. As I said earlier, Mono is going to version 1.2,
and Monodevelop has to keep up with these releases.
I like too see some extra features. Things can stabilize when Mono 1.2
is out....
I work with the svn version of MD and this works pretty well for me.
Can't recommend it for a production release yet ;), but I like
code-completion and some other features.

&gt;<i> Sorry to say all that, but it's my honest opinion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>np, but remember: the mono world is changing continuously...
Once there is a stable 1.2 release (or maybe 2.0), a stable release of
the debugger with integration in MD and integration of a gui builder
(stetic) in MD, RAD development with mono can begin :)

For the time, you can just use gvim with glade :p

I think mono (and MD, debugger, stetic...)-devs are doing some nice
work!

(hope m English is readable ;)
