You might still have a leak by keeping references to objects around.

&gt;<i> 2. Some problem with Mono.Posix ( because of some P/Invoke?? ) 
</I>
mod-mono-server (xsp module in svn) does exactly that. I've never tried
running it for 24 hours with no clients, but with clients, it works
fine.

&gt;<i> 3. Peridically I have a thread which wakes up, checks something and
</I>&gt;<i> sleeps again. It uses a mutex. Could that be some issue?
</I>
No. mod-mono-server does much more than that and no problems at all.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How do I detect if it is a mono run-time/mono package issue or an
</I>&gt;<i> issue with my code?
</I>&gt;<i> The mono version I use is 1.0.4, but the same problem was detected in
</I>&gt;<i> mono 1.1.4 too.
</I>&gt;<i> Could you please guide me?
</I>
I'd recommend using 1.1.7 instead.
