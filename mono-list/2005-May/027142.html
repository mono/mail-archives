<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt;I'm running monodevelop successfully on SuSe 9.3.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;1. Forget all this rug stuff, it doesn't work; I fiddled with it for a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;long time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;2. Remove ALL SuSe's mono packages, this requires removing Beagle and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Tomboy but you can put them in again later.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;3. Download the packages from <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Downloads">http://www.mono-project.com/Downloads</A> into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;a directory
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;4. Do a rpm -Uvh * in that directory
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;5. On two of five boxes I needed to run &quot;/sbin/ldconfig&quot; before anything
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;would work.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;6. Monodevelop now runs!
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for that.  I'm not sure what it says about Novell if what you say 
</I>&gt;<i> is true.  Rug is their recommended method after all, so if it doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> work, especially on their own distribution (SuSE), they really ought to 
</I>&gt;<i> be looking at it.  Maybe they are.
</I>
9.3 is new, as is Monodevelop 0.7;  these things will sort themselves
out.  I've been using rug/red-carpet since Ximian released it, it is an
excellent product and solution.

&gt;<i> a) What should I uninstall?  Do I have to use rug to do it, as I used 
</I>&gt;<i> rug to install at least some of the packages in the first place?  Or 
</I>&gt;<i> should I use apt, or YaST, since I guess some of the packages were in 
</I>&gt;<i> the original 9.3 upgrade?
</I>
rpm  -qa | grep mono

Remove all those, and the ones that depend on them.

&gt;<i> b) Following the link you gave to the 9.3 packages leads me to 30 
</I>&gt;<i> separate packages to install, or 5 zip files containing these 30 
</I>&gt;<i> packages.  Once I've got all these packages, which ones am I supposed to 
</I>&gt;<i> install and in what order?
</I>
You probably want all of them although you may not need all the &quot;gapi&quot;
ones;  and it you don't do ASP/web stuff you don't need mon_mono/xsp.
But I'd guess you want all the other ones.

&gt;<i> I suppose that I can at least take some consolation from the fact that I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't appear to be the only one having trouble.  It does make you 
</I>&gt;<i> compare the installation experience with the equivalent for VS, doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> it.  
</I>
VS wasn't released last week for a Windows version only about a month
old. :)

&gt;<i> VS does take a long time to install, and I have had the occasional 
</I>&gt;<i> problem with it, but nothing like this.  And I've never had any trouble 
</I>&gt;<i> installing the .NET framework.  It won't put me off from getting to 
</I>&gt;<i> grips with mono - but it may mean that I just use it as a runtime 
</I>&gt;<i> environment and not for development.  I'd find that very sad.
</I>
Ok, I've never used VS.  You'd have to pay me a great deal of money to
put up with using a M$ product for my day-to-day work.  Time is saves it
one area it consumes may fold more futzing with myriad 'mystery'
problems with useless error messages.

&gt;<i> I've been trying to get a full mono 1.1.x installation with monodevelop 
</I>&gt;<i> now almost since the day 1.1 was released. :(  Although I should perhaps 
</I>&gt;<i> note that the problem has always been with monodevelop.  mono itself has 
</I>&gt;<i> always installed just fine and done exactly what it's supposed to do.  
</I>&gt;<i> However, I regard a decent IDE as very important.  
</I>
Same,  monodevelop is the bugger of the mix.

&gt;<i> I know this isn't a 
</I>&gt;<i> view shared by everyone, but I much prefer to use a good IDE over a text 
</I>&gt;<i> editor, however sophisticated.  
</I>
Same, an monodevelop is quite nice; certainly worth the wrestling match
to get it to run.

&gt;<i> Hopefully this doesn't sound overcritical.  Mono is important to me and 
</I>&gt;<i> I want it to succeed.  I recognise that there may be issues with my 
</I>&gt;<i> particular installation even though it is a brand new SuSE 9.3 install 
</I>&gt;<i> (via upgrade from 9.2), so there shouldn't be that many problems, should 
</I>&gt;<i> there?
</I>
I never upgrade.  Make /home a separate partition and just reinstall the
new distribution.  I belong to a largish LUG and just about everyone has
given up on upgrading;  for a workstation the convenience of upgrading
is rarely worth the potential flakiness (especially if you've used third
party packages or ever once done an rpm --force).
