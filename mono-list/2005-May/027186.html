</I>Todd,

I'm sure you're correct - but the question is how can a non-expert in 
these things, of reasonable intelligence, discover what needs to be done 
to put things right?

At the moment, all I know is that I can't get monodevelop to run under 
mono 1.1.7.  I don't know why and I don't know how to fix it.  I've 
posted all the information I know about.  If I need to post some more, 
I'd be more than happy to do so - or to repost what I've already posted.

Usual caveats about my own shortcomings apply.

Peter
