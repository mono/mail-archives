<PRE>I didn't know you could upgrade for free.  That helps!

Thank you!

</I>According to 
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/howtobuy/pricingretail.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/howtobuy/pricingretail.mspx</A> the 
upgrade price for XP is $199, which does not, of course include upgrades 
to Office, Visual Studio, etc etc.  You pay Novell $68 and you get 
everything upgraded.  So you get 2 and a bit SuSE upgrades for the price 
of one Windows upgrade, and you get tonnes more stuff upgraded.

You can also wait a while and upgrade via ftp for free, as well, of course.

And lastly, you don't have to do an upgrade if you don't want to.  You 
only have to upgrade if you want the new features - in which case it's 
not just a minor version upgrade.

Just my 2c worth (Welsh ceiniogau)
