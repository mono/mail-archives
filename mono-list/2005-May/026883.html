I have no desire to address your ranting about a website that may or may
not be the most clear, but absolutely is not as difficult as you say to
navigate (As a point of reference, one of our developers at work who has
never used linux was able to build mono 1.1.6 without any help from
anyone, and asked a grand total of 2 questions in order to get MD 0.6
running)

Thanks for the bug reports.

In case you were just tuning in, you have filed a grand total of 0 bug
reports, so as far as we know, MD works fine for you.

But thanks for helping us so much.
