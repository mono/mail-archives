</I>Yes, you're right. The whole reason must be that I'm just too stupid to
do it the right way.

</I>I didn't intend to file any bug reports. I'm not involved with this
project and I don't have any reason to spend my time trying to help it.
I would have, if I saw that a couple of bug reports might make it
usable, but, judging by the amount of bugs that showed up after 5
minutes of playing around, it's not the case.

What I did intend to do was outlining how difficult and
counter-intuitive the installation process was - that's because if the
maintainers actually corrected the problems that I described and started
paying attention to them in future, it would make things much simpler
the next time I decide to try a new version.

By the way, if you need additional proofs for these statements, just
take a look at the adjacent threads:
* [Mono-list] Mono 1.1.7 install script not available
* [Mono-list] development environment for mono:
        &quot;I did have a pretty hard time getting the Mono core, xsp, and
Monodoc installed (like I said, I'm a newbie--but learning fast).&quot;
*[Mono-list] debugger available only in svn?

Ah yes, monodoc was causing me problems, too, and I was optimistic
enough to try to compile MD with debugger support.
