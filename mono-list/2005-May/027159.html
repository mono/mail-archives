</I>Well, I don't want to start a flame war here, Carl :), but as I pointed out:
*  You don't have to upgrade SuSE every time a new version appears
*  You get 2 and a bit SuSE upgrades for the price of one MS upgrade - 
so that should keep you going for a bit
*  You get more software upgrades in a SuSE upgrade.

If we just look at the office suite.  MS Office costs something like 
$200 dollars, and from what I see on 
<A HREF="http://www.nextag.com/2003-microsoft-office-upgrade/search-html">http://www.nextag.com/2003-microsoft-office-upgrade/search-html</A> the 
upgrades cost about the same.

So one purchase of XP plus Office comes to something like $400 
(conservatively) and we haven't even started talking about the price of 
VS yet!  Even the academic price for that is in the region of $150, I 
think, if my memory and currency conversion head is working.  So you'd 
still be in pocket after one SuSE purchase and 5 upgrades.  That should 
see you through from one MS upgrade to the next.

As I've posted recently, I do think there are problems and SuSE is not 
perfect - but I don't think it can be attacked on price.  On some other 
things, may be ;) but not on price.

Cheers

Peter
