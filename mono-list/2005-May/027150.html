<PRE>That sounds great.  This has only been a minor inconvenience for me.  Mono
is great stuff and monodevelop is a great tool.  I was surprised to see it
break, but not overly surprised.  I realize this stuff is still under heavy
development.  I started running Mono on Red Hat 8 and 9, but it was just too
much trouble to keep up.  SuSE has made it a lot easier, but I can't believe
they want another $60 every time they do a minor version upgrade.  How are
they going to compete with Windows XP by doing that?

I am going to try to package Gtk# 2 (which is the only piece missing for
you to get 0.7, which works really well) on SUSE 9.2. Hopefully that
would make things easier for you. You could try building gtk# and
everything up from there from source.

I don't know why MonoDevelop breaks with 1.1.7. MonoDevelop has often
been an application that is tightly integrated to a specific version of
Mono. Your best bet to get things working is 0.7, with the newest MD and
Mono.
