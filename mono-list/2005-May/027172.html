<PRE>Hola!

&gt;<i> Back onto point a bit here. I have noticed a couple recurring trends.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> #1) People who use the installer, and not the rpms, and then install
</I>&gt;<i> gtk# 1.9.5 into a *different* prefix than the installer, and then
</I>&gt;<i> install MD seem to have the most issues. To me, and Daniel can correct
</I>&gt;<i> me if I am wrong, but it seems that people using the installer don't
</I>&gt;<i> seem to understand that if you don't install mono stuff into the same
</I>&gt;<i> prefix as mono, you need to mung things like MONO_GAC_PATH and
</I>&gt;<i> LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc. Maybe this is something that should be put into
</I>&gt;<i> some sort of HOWTO for the installer.
</I>
You are correct. The original purpose of the installer was more of a runtime
than using it for development purposes. All the MONO_GAC_PATH,
LD_LIBRARY_PATH &quot;magic&quot; happens in &lt;intallpath&gt;/bin/mono, which is a shell
script that sets the environment before executing Mono. If people are
compiling stuff against what is included, we need to make it more explicit,
add that to the installer Mini-FAQ in the website, maybe include it as a
README.

The installer, however, includes GTK# support, I believe he needs to
properly setup PKG_CONFIG_PATH to also point to &lt;installdir&gt;/lib/pkgconfig

This week I plan to set aside some time and have a new build that includes
MonoDevelop support. 

&gt;<i> I would recommend for people who are having issues installing
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDevelop look into how their mono prefix and gtk# prefixes are setup,
</I>&gt;<i> as that seems to be the #1 cause of all of these problems. Mixing RPMS
</I>&gt;<i> w/ tarballs w/ installers is not something that should be done lightly
</I>&gt;<i> and indiscriminately.
</I>
I agree. I think all this comes from people trying all different
installation methods in their frustration to get things set up :)
A lot of people come from a Windows background, so this imposes much more
work on us packagers to make sure everything &quot;just works&quot;. This is even more
difficult than, say, Java runtime, because of the dependencies all over the
place (gtk, gtkhtml, gecko, etc.). But we will get there, it just comes from
using a state-of-the-art platform like Mono ;)

Un saludo

Daniel
