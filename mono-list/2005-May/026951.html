</I>My problems are very similar to yours (on SuSE 9.3).  I'm hoping to see 
some new packages soon (via rug) that will overcome the problems.  It is 
very frustrating, though, and not the best way to make people 
enthusiastic about mono.

It may be heretical to say it, but this is one of the things MS has got 
right.  Installing the .NET Framework along with VSS is a breeze 
(usually).  It makes you feel dirty :) and costs you money, of course, 
but it doesn't have you throwing your mouse mat (or worse) across the room.

I'm sure the mono and monodevelop people will get this right shortly.  
It's a very new product after all.  So I'm prepared to cut them some 
slack.  It's easy to criticise, and until I can contribute 
constructively I think thats what I should do - for the time being anyway.

Just my 2c (ceiniog - Welsh)

Peter
