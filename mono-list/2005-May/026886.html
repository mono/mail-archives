&gt;<i> Yes, but on the Downloads page it doesn't say that the prebuilt packages
</I>&gt;<i> are for 1.1.7. In fact, you get the feeling that they must be for 1.0.6,
</I>&gt;<i> because that's the stable version! So you don't even bother looking
</I>&gt;<i> there. Instead you straightly follow the link to the 1.1.7 Release
</I>&gt;<i> Notes, which is on top of the Downloads page, to only find there a
</I>&gt;<i> source tarball and no indication of prebuilt 1.1.7 packages availability.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>1.1.6 is good enough for most apps....
Why must everything in our society be so 'instant'? Lets give them some
time to prepare packages for al these different distributions....

You said it took 12 hours to install mono? I am a patient person, but 12
hours!!!
&quot;It would have taken me as little as 2 to 3 hours...&quot;

ergghh: that's also very long. An install of mono is maybe 10 minutes
work (ok that's maybe because gentoo has Peter Johanson who's a very
good maintainer for this) but It should not take longer then 1 hour on
other distributions.

A typical monodevelop build from svn is max. 5 minutes. The first time I
spent nearly an hour to find out everything about the svn repo and
things like .autogen.sh + options (boo, mono-debugger, java)

&gt;<i> Yes, but not with svn+ssh scheme. In other words, this won't work
</I>&gt;<i> without password (taken directly from the readme):
</I>&gt;<i>         svn co svn+<A HREF="ssh://USER@mono-cvs.ximian.com/source/trunk/mono">ssh://USER@mono-cvs.ximian.com/source/trunk/mono</A>
</I>
I do really suggest a tutorial about searching the web. (some persons
would say &quot;STFW&quot; but I remain patient...)

1 www.google.com
2 &quot;mono anonymous svn&quot;
3 <A HREF="http://svn.myrealbox.com/">http://svn.myrealbox.com/</A> 
or <A HREF="http://mono-project.com/AnonSVN">http://mono-project.com/AnonSVN</A> ('official'?)

Is this difficult????
