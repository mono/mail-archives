</I>It was an issue for me trying to learn to use mono from books that said 
that SWF was working and having to find out for myself that it had been 
dropped in 1.0.x.  The answer I had in this group that explained all 
that to me also explained that the reason it had been dropped was 
because of &quot;issues&quot;.  It was Miguel who replied, I think.

I had no idea whether the new version worked well or not: and I was just 
trying to help.  If the new version works well, then I'm pleased for 
you, believe me.

It's no big deal.

Cheers

Peter
