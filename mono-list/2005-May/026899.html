You said it, not me.

Well, myself and many others use it for 8 hours a day at work, so it
seems to work well enough for us. The fact that you don't have time to
file a couple of simple bugs to help yourself and others but you do have
time to engage in multi-day flaming on a public mailing list for no
reason basically shows where your true intentions are.

It is one thing to be unhappy about the state of various things, but it
is another to flame people without any cause. The mono website is a
wiki. If you are such a grand master of making clear instructions on how
to do everything, why not help out? And if you have the ability to find
bugs in software so well that makes it so you can declare MD as
'unusable' in 5 minutes (which i doubt, considering 5 minutes isnt even
enough for the completion databases to build up) file a couple of them.

My guess is that you build MD from SVN (which is fine) and it had bugs
(which it does), but guess what. YOU BUILT FROM SVN. ITS UNDER
DEVELOPMENT. What exactly did you expect? A product like VS.NET for
free? MonoDevelop is a community run project with no corporate support
and just a couple developers. If you are unwilling to even help out as
far as filing a bug or 3, then don't bother crying in public when it
doesn't fit your needs.
