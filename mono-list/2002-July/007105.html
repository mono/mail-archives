<PRE>Hi guys,

I need a volunteer for a very simple, but extremely boring and time
consuming job ....

Currently, the MCS compiler tests (mcs/tests) are just one big mess.
There are 144 files numbered from test-1.cs to test-144.cs.  The mess
is that you don't know what all these tests do except by looking into
all these files.

So what we need is a list of all these tests - for each test, provide
a short description what this test does and then put all these tests
into groups: all tests about contants into one group, all tests about
arrays into one group etc.

As a second step, we need to check whether some of the tests are
duplicate and possibly put tests which are very closely related into
one file.

This would make it a lot easier for people to add new tests and it'll
also allow us to use the test suite to check for particular features
(instead of running all the tests).

If someone is interested, please let me know, any help would be
greatly appreciated.
