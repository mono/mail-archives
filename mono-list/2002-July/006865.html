<PRE>&gt;<i> The subject says it all :)
</I>
I got excited, as usual, so I wrote this on the web site:

	Ajay was the first to notice Mono's first birthday.

	In a year, we have achieved plenty:
	&lt;ul&gt;
		* 94 contributors with CVS access (84 non-Ximian
		  developers).
		* A complete CLI implementation:
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt; A fast and performing x86 JIT engine
		 	(inlining, constant propagation).
			&lt;li&gt; An interpreter for other systems (PPC,
		        Sparc, StrongArm).
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		* A self-hosting C# compiler, which can compile its 		  class
libraries.
		* 37,140 file changes in CVS.
		* 92,000 lines of C code.
		* 437,000 lines of C# code (compiler, classes, tests)
		* A working core for ASP.NET and ADO.NET.
		* Major subsystems are functional: RegularExpressions,
		  System.XML, XML.Schema, System.Data, System.Web.
		* The Gtk# project, which is maturing rapidly.
	&lt;/ul&gt;

	Thanks to everyone who has made Mono possible with their
	feedback, regression tests, their comments, their help on the mailing
	list, code contributions, complete classes, bug reporting, the
	countless hours of bug hunting.  This project would not have
	been possible with every contribution.  

	It has been a great year for everyone involved in the
	project.  I think we have built a new and exciting community.

	Now we have a solid foundation to build on, so this next year
	looks even more exciting: not only because we will see more
	Mono applications, but we will begin using Mono as an
	`library' to be linked with applications that want to get
	scripting-like features; Gtk# is our ticket to create nice
	GNOME applications; And we will be developing CORBA bindings
	to integrate with other object systems.

	Also, for those interested in optimizations and tuning, this
	year we will get to play with more advanced optimizations and
	all kinds of interesting research ideas for improving Mono
	code generation.

	A special thanks to the Mono developers at Ximian for managing
	to survive their manager and a special thanks to our
	regression test marshal Nick Drochak, who has been hunting
	down, and fixing code in our class libraries and keeping us on
	track for so long.
