</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
It is :(. In fact, I just fixed a bug which caused the enum2.exe test to fail: Enum::Parse used so much stack space that
gcc generated a sub &lt;IMM32&gt;, %esp opcode into the prelude, which my exception handling code couldn't handle. 
I use objdump because I found no other way to determine the size of the compiled functions. 

&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; What I wanted to look into was to use the JIT to 
</I>&gt;<i> generate code that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; would end up in a library, basically reusing the JIT, 
</I>&gt;<i> but turning on all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; the optimizations for this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This approach would also avoid much code duplication. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; So IMO we should first check if we gain anything by using 
</I>&gt;<i> gcc, and of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; course we need a solution for the exception problem? 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think the approach of using gcc is certainly interesting 
</I>&gt;<i> even if the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; first snapshot has limitations.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The primary purpouse of ngen-ed assemblies is to reduce 
</I>&gt;<i> startup and JIT
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; costs (microsoft itself documents ngen-assemblies being 
</I>&gt;<i> slower code-wise
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; than jitted code...). Of course, performance is an bonus:-), but I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very impressed with the first snapshot.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The gain in mcs compilation times, for example, seems to match
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pretty well with the jit overhead as measured with mono --profile.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And, of course, mcs is not a good benchmark for native code quality.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Of the current limitations, the .ovf opcodes seems only a matter of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (boring) programming, mostly. The exception handling stuff 
</I>&gt;<i> is certainly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; harder and if done using the C++ exception tables, it will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; require porting efforts between different compilers. However, I just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; checked and methods with exception tables are less than 7% 
</I>&gt;<i> in mcs and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; less than 2% in corlib, so even if 5% of the methods still 
</I>&gt;<i> need to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; jitted, it's not a big problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> good news ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My main concern with using gcc is that we might not be able 
</I>&gt;<i> to constrain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the gcc optimizer to obey the CLR rules (Zoltan notes the 
</I>&gt;<i> problem with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; division by 0, for example). Using the JIT to output the 
</I>&gt;<i> code would give
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; us better control on such issues, but researching these 
</I>&gt;<i> issues is the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only way to find out if the concept works:-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I think everybody agrees that it would be nice to have a 
</I>&gt;<i> native code
</I>&gt;<i> generator, so integrating that code into the sources should 
</I>&gt;<i> be the goal.
</I>&gt;<i> All I am concerned about it to avoid code duplication, which makes it
</I>&gt;<i> hard to maintain that code. I would like to share as much code as
</I>&gt;<i> possible with the JIT.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
If there is concern whenever this will be the 'real' MONO ngen, I would gladly name it something else. Any ideas?

&gt;<i> Unfortunately the current patch is much to large to integrate. What we
</I>&gt;<i> need is a bunch of smaller patches which we can integrate into our
</I>&gt;<i> codebase.
</I>
I plan on maintaining the code whenever its integrated into MONO CVS or not. The current patch is 600 lines long 
(this includes the context added by diff) + the two new files (ngen-runtime.{c,h}). It includes the following:

  ngen-runtime.{c,h} - this does the loading and linking in of native assemblies
  appdomain.h        - adds a new field to MonoJitInfo
  assembly.{c,h}     - adds a callback function which will be called when an assembly is loaded
  exception.c        - adds exception handling for native methods (hackish)
  mono.c             - adds additional command line arguments + installs the native assembly loading callback
  trampoline.c       - adds a new trampoline which can be called by the native methods + adds a new argument to
                       x86_magic_trampoline so it can read the receiver off the stack
  
  There are two bug fixes/improvements in the patch:
   reflection.c      - speed up mono_type_get_object which seems to be called a lot
   trampoline.c      - the arch_get_trampoline function sometimes returns a pointer to JIT generated code instead of a 
			     trampoline. This is wrong if the returned pointer is put into a vtable. This is not happening 				     currently, but I think it is by coincidence not by design :).
