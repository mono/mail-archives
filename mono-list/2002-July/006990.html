<PRE>Oops.  Sent w/ wrong account.

&gt;<i> wxWindows (<A HREF="http://www.wxWindows.org">http://www.wxWindows.org</A>) -- I don't think anyone suggested
</I>&gt;<i> this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Windows 3.1, Windows 95, Windows NT, Unix with the GTK+ toolkit, Unix
</I>&gt;<i> with the Motif toolkit, and MacOS.  It also supports UNIX with X11!  And
</I>&gt;<i> Mac is both Carbon and Aqua!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm going to try P/Invoking this tonight and tomorrow and see how I can
</I>&gt;<i> do.  It seems to be a fairly sane abstraction and supports many looks
</I>&gt;<i> and feels.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps something Ximian or the GNOME group could do is create a GNOME
</I>&gt;<i> back-end for it.  The GTK+ one is based on GTK+ 1.2 (I believe) and
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't add all the GNOME components.  I'd think it's be fairly quick to
</I>&gt;<i> reimplement it in GTK+ 2 and GNOME2.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's already in Object-Oriented C++, so converting it to Object-Oriented
</I>&gt;<i> C# shouldn't be too hard (I know I'll hate myself in the morning for
</I>&gt;<i> saying that)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The wxWindows 2 licence is essentially the L-GPL (Library General Public
</I>&gt;<i> Licence), with an exception stating that derived works in binary form
</I>&gt;<i> may be distributed on the user's own terms. This is a solution that
</I>&gt;<i> satisfies those who wish to produce GPL'ed software using wxWindows, and
</I>&gt;<i> also those producing proprietary software.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know it ends up being another layer of abstraction, but does anyone
</I>&gt;<i> see a reason this would be a bad choice for the API considering all the
</I>&gt;<i> OS's it already works on and has native look and feel in?
</I>
Actually, after looking at this, I think I'll still use it, but only use a small subset (the GUI portions).  Just thought I should add this.
