<PRE>Hi Gabriel,

&gt;<i> What do I need to watch out for when programming in VB.NET so that I'm
</I>sure to be able to run those apps on Linux?
	Not making any PInvoke or DLL calls should and not using anything in
the Microsoft.* namespaces should suffice. Also do not use any
Methods/Classes
marked as &quot;This type/method supports the .NET Framework infrastructure and
is not intended to be used directly from your code.&quot; even if you know what
these classes/methods do.

&gt;<i> Will I be able to use Microsoft SQL Server 2000 or will I need to switch
</I>to a specific Open Source Database.  Will I need to recode?
    I am not the right person, but IMO there should not be any need to
recode.

&gt;<i> Will built-in reporting be supported for crystal reports?  This is a
</I>heavily used part of our system.

    Probably not. Crystal Reports are propriety. Someone may try to emulate
the behaviour, but no-one has yet volunteered.

&gt;<i> Who about writing to the registry? As I understand it, Linux does not have
</I>a counterpart to the registry.  Should I avoid relying on that feature?
	
    Try to avoid it. Although there would be a emulation for registry in
mono too. IMO GNOME does have a registry like mechanism for configuration.

Hope that helps,
Ajay
