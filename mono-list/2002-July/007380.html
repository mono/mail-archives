</I>&gt;<i> Can you explain what the LMF is? I looked at the code, but I can't understand what it is.
</I>
Sure. The Problem is that unmanaged code can raise exception, and we
must be able to recover from such exception and print a stack trace for
example (you can find some docu in mono/docs/exceptions). One (compiler
independent) way to do that is to save a data structure with all
necessary info on the stack each time you call an unmanaged method - we
call that info Last Managed Frame (MonoLMF).

If a exception occurs in unmanaged code we simply use the data in the
LMF to unwind the stack.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> BTW: I started this as a hobby project to learn about .NET/compilers etc. I wouldn't be suprised if it turned to be unusable
</I>&gt;<i> due to problems such as the one above...
</I>
Such code is always usable. If it turns out that we cant solve all
problems we simply need to find another Solution. But I imagine you have
learned a lot about mono when you wrote that code!

&gt;<i> &gt;         2. Array bound checking: There is no array bound 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; checking at the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;            moment and maybe that is the only reason why it speeds up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;            pnetmark? gcc is unable to do bound check removal, so array
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;            access will be slow (or you have to remove that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; checks before
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;            you emit C code).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You are right. I somehow throught that mono does not do bound checking (perhaps an earlier version didn't) so I put that
</I>&gt;<i> on the TODO list instead of implementing it right away.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         3. I wonder if gcc is really able to optimize the emitted C#
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;            very much.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> gcc is designed to optimize procedural code, so of course it has problems with virtual calls, bound checks, delegates etc. 
</I>&gt;<i> But every program contains a mix of high level and low level code, so some performance gains can be expected ever for
</I>&gt;<i> programs written in an object-oriented style such as mcs.
</I>
Is it difficult to implement array bound checking? If not I would like
to have some real benchmark results (including bound checking).
