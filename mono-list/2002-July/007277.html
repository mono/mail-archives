<PRE>You've sent that link before, and I still think it's complete BS:

1) every other mailing list I've ever seen uses the reply-to field, and
I don't remember ever seeing anymoue bitch about it.

2) every time I hit I hit reply-all on a message that I've already
replied to, I have to remove my name from the list of recipients
otherwise I receive my message twice. Every time I do this I curse your
link.

3) It makes incoming mail redirection more complicated. Which means you
have to use the '[mono-list]' crap, and I could write a whole we page on
why that's a bad idea...

4) I'd say the 'reply-to-author' case is used less than 1% of the time.
Why make it a pain for the majority of us the majority of the time?

5) as for the &quot;coddling the brain-dead&quot; bit, that's just the kind of
elitist attitude that's so prevalent in the open-source community that
drives regular users away. That guy works on Elm, and since &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt;
mailer has some feature, &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; thinks that everyone else should
suffer for not using a mailer that has the fame features as his. BS.

Sure, I don't have as many cons as your link has pros, but still.

Piers.
