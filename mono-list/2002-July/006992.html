I just posted the following to www.go-mono.com, for those not tracking
it:


Jul 16th, 2002

Paolo today got mono to complete host itself on Linux. This means that
we can now compile the `corlib' using the Mono C# compiler and the Mono
runtime.
Compiling the corlib was rather tricky, because the types that the
compiler uses during the compilation process will come from the source
code it is compiling. 
After a few months of work, we have finally fleshed out all the
remaining bugs. Now the next step is to update the makefiles to compile
with the Mono tool-chain.
A recapitulation: 

      * The Mono C# compiler was able to compile itself on December
        28th, 2002. The resulting image contained errors though. 
      * The Mono C# compiler was able to self-compile in on January 3rd,
        2002. Becoming a self-hosting compiler on Windows. 
      * The Mono runtime matured enough by March 12, 2002 that it was
        able to bootstrap the Mono C# compiler on Linux using our
        interpreter. This means that our development tool was self
        sufficient. 
      * On March 26th, the JIT engine was fixed, so we could use this to
        run the compiler on Linux. 
      * Martin fixed the remaining bugs in the compiler that stopped it
        from compiling the `corlib'. The resuling image still contained
        errors though. 
      * On July 8th, Radek got the PowerPC port to bootstrap the C#
        compiler. This is important, because it exposed various tricky
        issues in a big-endian system. 
      * Today: we can bootstrap the compiler using libraries and the
        compiler compiled with itself on Linux. The process is complete.

In the meantime, Dietmar has quietly implemented the remaining pieces of
Marshalling in the Mono runtime. This is very important for the Gtk#
guys to move on with their bindings.

To make things more interesting, he replaced most of the architecture
specific code generation for trampolines (delegates, invocations,
function and p/invoke trampolines) to use CIL. This CIL is then compiled
on the flight by the JIT Compiler engine. By doing this, we have reduced
the burden to port the JITer to new architectures, and that our
trampoline code is cross platform. 

Looking for volunteers

We are looking for volunteers to help complete various pieces of Mono
and help move the project forward, we need contributions to: 

      * More tests to the existing class libraries. 
      * Finish existing class libraries, check our class status pages to
        see all the missing things. There are open tasks all over the
        place: XML, Database access, enterprise services, configuration,
        ASP.NET, Drawing APIs, and more. 
      * Since we have now ASP.NET running, we would like to create an
        ASP.NET application to maintain our class library documentation.
        We have some special needs (read them here). There is a
        prototype written using Windows.Forms, but we believe it will be
        faster to have this done using ASP.NET (and it is also a nice
        way of stress testing it). 
      * Support for the VB runtime: we need contributions to make our VB
        runtime mature enough to host applications compiled with the
        VB.NET to run with Mono. 
      * We need people to help write the documentation: you can start
        editing our XML files by hand, and once we have the ASP.NET
        tool, upgrade to that. 

Enjoy!
Miguel.
