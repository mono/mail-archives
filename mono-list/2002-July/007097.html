<PRE>&gt;<i> I am quite new to mono developing. I was trying to make mono run a c# library that makes simpler to write client server programs that exchange xml streams (it is called jabber.net).
</I>&gt;<i> My problem is that since both System.dll and System.Xml.dll classes needs some more methods to make all the stuff work.
</I>&gt;<i> My idea was to provide first the code to System.Xml package and then to the other.
</I>&gt;<i> Now my question is: is there a well know way to only use System.Xml classes provided by mono, so that it is possible to make them somehow more complete?
</I>&gt;<i> My idea was to make a VS.NET solution and include as projects both the library and the System.Xml.dll project file: is that the best way (sure at the beginning, when the compiler was not self hosting, you made something similar...)?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I believe Jason and Krall did check in VS.NET files that you can use to
compile our System.XML and even to run the System.XML tests (which is
way cool, and way simple)
