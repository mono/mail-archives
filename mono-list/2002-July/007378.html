</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This announcement is of course really exciting.  I have only taken a

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a very interesting idea.  I will let Dietmar and Paolo

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on it.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         1. It does not work with exceptions: The current code is
</I>&gt;<i>            incorrect because it does not save/restore the LMF when

</I>&gt;<i>            would lead to serious performance problems.
</I>
Can you explain what the LMF is? I looked at the code, but I can't understand what it is.

BTW: I started this as a hobby project to learn about .NET/compilers etc. I wouldn't be suprised if it turned to be unusable
due to problems such as the one above...


&gt;<i>         2. Array bound checking: There is no array bound 
</I>&gt;<i> checking at the
</I>&gt;<i>            moment and maybe that is the only reason why it speeds up
</I>&gt;<i>            pnetmark? gcc is unable to do bound check removal, so array
</I>&gt;<i>            access will be slow (or you have to remove that 
</I>&gt;<i> checks before
</I>&gt;<i>            you emit C code).
</I>
You are right. I somehow throught that mono does not do bound checking (perhaps an earlier version didn't) so I put that
on the TODO list instead of implementing it right away.


&gt;<i>         3. I wonder if gcc is really able to optimize the emitted C#
</I>&gt;<i>            very much.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
gcc is designed to optimize procedural code, so of course it has problems with virtual calls, bound checks, delegates etc. 
But every program contains a mix of high level and low level code, so some performance gains can be expected ever for
programs written in an object-oriented style such as mcs.

&gt;<i> &gt; What I wanted to look into was to use the JIT to generate code that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would end up in a library, basically reusing the JIT, but 
</I>&gt;<i> turning on all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the optimizations for this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This approach would also avoid much code duplication.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So IMO we should first check if we gain anything by using gcc, and of
</I>&gt;<i> course we need a solution for the exception problem?
</I>
