While I admit, in theory, that it is nice to have abstraction
as to what provider you choose, I find that in practice that is
usually not very important.  If you're developing a
tool/utility/platform/application/whatever that uses a database, you are
probably going to consciously choose which database you are going to use
before you actually build the application.

Besides, it isn't all that often that your SQL is 100% portable across
all database systems anyway, so abstracting away the provider is
probably not all that useful.  Again, this is just in my experience;
YMMV.

If you create an OleDbConnection, you can (must?) specify the DataSource/
Provider before opening the connection.  Thus, you can have something 
like what you said about the JDBC driver...

cnc = new OleDbConnection (&quot;Provider=MSDAORA;DataSource=mydb;User ID=user;Password=password&quot;);

...or something like that.  I don't exactly remember the OleDb
connection string format. 

The way I see things with ADO.NET is you either use the SqlClient if you 
are accessing MSSQL or use OleDbClient otherwise.  SqlClient offers some
extra features over OleDbClient, clearly because it is developed by 
Microsoft.  If you want extra features for your PostgreSQL database,
then you use a provider specified to PostgreSQL.  AFAIK there isn't
anything stopping you from use OleDbClient to access a MSSQL database;
you just miss out on some features (and it probably isn't as optimized
for MSSQL).

That's just my 2 cents' worth.
