<PRE>eweek has an article on .NET Versions 1.1 2.0.
1.1 due out later this year, 2.0 first beta January 2003, second beta in the
summer, release in December 2003.
See quote from Miguel below!

<A HREF="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,373783,00.asp">http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,373783,00.asp</A>


Some .Net developers told eWeek that .Net still has a long way to go. &quot;.Net
has some really good things in it, but they also have some very broken APIs
built into it. I would like to see Microsoft fix those APIs,&quot; said Miguel de
Icaza, co-founder and chief technology officer of Boston-based Ximian Inc.,
which is developing Mono, an open-source version of .Net Framework that will
run on Linux.

&quot;The class libraries seem to have been rushed out the door before they were
tested enough, and it shows in various areas,&quot; de Icaza said. The problems
range &quot;from simple inconsistencies in some database classes to fundamental
problems with the class libraries.&quot;
