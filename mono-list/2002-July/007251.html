<PRE>I am interested in this project and would like to see if there are ways
I can use my skills to contribute.  I am not a programming super hero. I
am more of a systems analyst, but yet there may be ways I could
participate.  Perhaps by planning and running test routines. Perhaps in
other ways.  I just don't know.   I thought I would ask though, because
I would like to see this project move forward.  Right now I work on
projects in a Microsoft .NET environment and we will be using C#  to
build ASP.NET applications mostly.  I look forward to hearing from you.
I will follow your progress no matter what.
