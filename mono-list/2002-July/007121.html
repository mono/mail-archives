<PRE>Sam,

Thanks for your reply. I am curious to know what you mean by &quot;support from
those higher up.&quot; In short, I am wondering what could stop you from
developing a solution  to do conformance testing in mono (or any sort of
tools for that matter), especially if you enjoy doing such a task. I, for
one, can only see a benefit for having such a tool as probably would do
anyone involved with the project. Thanks for clarifying.

LdS
