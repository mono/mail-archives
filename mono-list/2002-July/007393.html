I didn't consider the register problem in my reply, so, unless we find a
nice solution for it, we may not be able to use the hack for icalls.
Using it for ngen-ed assemblies is less of an issue, because we could
check that the compiled methods obey the assumptions in the code before
installing the native lib in the GAC: this can't be easily done for
icalls.

</I>
I'm not advocating the integration of the patch right now.
Let's first experiment with it a bit, and see if we can find a solution
to the primary issues:
1) make sure we can get gcc to obey the rules of the CLR
2) try to remove the assumptions on the gcc code layout

The first is a correctness issue and is the most important.
The latter is a maintainability issue that I would like to find a
solution for (and it would allow us to enable scheduling in gcc).

About the code duplication issue, let's try to discuss with Zoltan what
is the best approach to the problem: some parts of the code are
certainly needed also if/when we use the JIT to precompile the
assemblies, for example.

Some other issues would need to be resolved in the code like the linking
phase, so we could get it to work for multiple app domains while keeping
the mmapped pages read-only.
I think the gcc approach may give good results, just let it still mature a
bit.
