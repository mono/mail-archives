No, I think you are not understanding me. The above example is a defined
form of address in rfc0822.

     group       =  phrase &quot;:&quot; [#mailbox] &quot;;&quot;

The csMailAPI MUST be able to parse these.

&gt;<i> &gt; 	&lt;enum name=&quot;MessageFlags&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	&lt;/enum&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This shouldn't be an enum since you can theoretically have more than a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; single flag marked. For example, a message could be Seen and Answered.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We use a bit field in Camel to handle this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	This can be handled by enum in C#. You need to add the Flags 
</I>&gt;<i> Attribute to the enum and make sure the enum values have a single bit set.
</I>&gt;<i> Eg None=0, Seen=1, Answered=2, New=4...
</I>
ok, right... I was mostly just making sure people understood that you
can't leave it up to the compiler to assign values like you normally do
with an enum.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Actually I'm not convinced that csMail should even worry 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about sorting. This can be done at a higher level.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Quite True. Its the burden of the Mail client.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A message's flags are really just metadata and not really part of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; message at all. Or at least that's my paradign.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Message::IsExpunged() sorta follows the same idea...why do we 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need this?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If we have an instance of the message, do we really care? I dunno,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; perhaps it could be useful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	It can be useful. Imagine an IMAP folder with some messages
</I>&gt;<i> in it. The client Gets A list of messages from the folder, marks
</I>&gt;<i> some of them as deleted and asks the API to save them. The methods
</I>&gt;<i> like ISExpunded can help in finding out if the message instance
</I>&gt;<i> has been deleted by the user and show appropriate label/image.
</I>&gt;<i> Only when you save the folder, is the message deleted from the
</I>&gt;<i> server. 
</I>
Deleted != Expunged. Expunged means it has already been *removed* from
the server while Deleted means it still exists on the server but is
flagged as Deleted.

Based on this definition, I'm not sure IsExpunged() really matters.
