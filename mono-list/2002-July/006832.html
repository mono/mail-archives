I didn't get any feedback (apart from the fact that I had forgotten to
attach the patched, which I resent). I know everyone else is busy, and I
do not have a massive amount of time to spend on the project, but I
would like to contribute. My problem at the moment is knowing exactly
where to start. I would like to help with the XML parts of the class
library (and I think my time would be better spent on the class library
than on the compiler) but I am aware that they are not of the highest
priority at the moment. 

Basically I would like to help but I am not entirely sure how to go
about it, and I do not have more than 5 or 6 hours a week spare to help.
