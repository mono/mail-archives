Lobbying or petitioning for the inclusion of xsp won't get it done any
faster, and won't help anyone. Frankly, if you're not tracking Mono CVS,
xsp is _not_ for you just yet.

xsp is developing at an amazing speed thanks to Gonzalo's hard work, but
there are still a few things to be done before it's even in 'beta' form.

If you are really that excited about xsp, please follow the CVS
instructions on <A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/">http://www.go-mono.com/</A>

That way you can follow its development more closely, help report bugs
and perhaps contribute a few lines of code.
