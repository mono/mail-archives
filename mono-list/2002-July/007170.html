<PRE>I'd like to apologize for starting these J2EE threads, I'm attempting to take them off list.

</I>&gt;<i> after sliced 
</I>&gt;<i> bread. If a theoretical Mono App Server could deliver on the 
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation's shortcomings, I believe the organizations 
</I>&gt;<i> backing it stand 
</I>&gt;<i> to gain a LOT. If you go and read that discussion on 
</I>&gt;<i> theserverside, you will 
</I>&gt;<i> see in the forum that the (J2EE) people are mostly 
</I>&gt;<i> complaining about the lack 
</I>&gt;<i> of choice when it comes to .NET development. You can only 
</I>&gt;<i> deploy on Windows, 
</I>&gt;<i> which mean only Intel hardware, limited database 
</I>&gt;<i> connectivity, only one  IDE 
</I>&gt;<i> etc etc. An open source Mono App Server running practially 
</I>&gt;<i> everywhere would 
</I>&gt;<i> make those people reconsider. Even further, the .NET API's aren't yet 
</I>&gt;<i> established, which means that if Mono offers a better 
</I>&gt;<i> alternative to a badly 
</I>&gt;<i> implemented Microsoft idea, people wouldn't be held back by 
</I>&gt;<i> compatibility 
</I>&gt;<i> concerns.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Open source app servers haven't fared so well, corporate IT
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; departments like established companies, consulting and support
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; services and all that (and that's where these companies make most of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their money, not on the software licensing).  Also, all open source
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; app servers (that I know of) are Java based and never 
</I>&gt;<i> managed to reach
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; critical mass (mostly, I believe, because of the lack of a 
</I>&gt;<i> first class
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; open source Java VM).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sun does provide a first class free-as-in-beer JVM for many 
</I>&gt;<i> operating systems, 
</I>&gt;<i> plus source code. Furthermore their JCP process is very much 
</I>&gt;<i> open to anyone, 
</I>&gt;<i> thus IMHO the benefits of open source development are 
</I>&gt;<i> available to java 
</I>&gt;<i> users. In other words, there is a pretty good JVM out there 
</I>&gt;<i> that's free and I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't see how that has anything to do with open sourced 
</I>&gt;<i> application servers' 
</I>&gt;<i> popularity.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On top of that, a recent survey showed that JBoss is prefered 
</I>&gt;<i> by more than 50% 
</I>&gt;<i> of interviewed developers - that has to say something?! For me, as an 
</I>&gt;<i> individual, if I wanted to learn about J2EE technology, open 
</I>&gt;<i> source is the 
</I>&gt;<i> only way to go considering commercial J2EE vendors' pricing. 
</I>&gt;<i> I can tell you 
</I>&gt;<i> for sure that JBoss and Tomcat (for those not in the know, 
</I>&gt;<i> Tomcat is the 
</I>&gt;<i> Apache J2EE Web container - JSPs/servlets etc.) being used in 
</I>&gt;<i> the enterprise 
</I>&gt;<i> a lot more than you can imagine. My friends at two very large 
</I>&gt;<i> businesses (a 
</I>&gt;<i> bank and a medical aid company) have told me they use a 
</I>&gt;<i> commercial J2EE (BEA 
</I>&gt;<i> or IBM) app server for their core business logic, plus JBoss 
</I>&gt;<i> for deployment 
</I>&gt;<i> of additional components (not that critical or at branch 
</I>&gt;<i> offices for example) 
</I>&gt;<i> and development.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This all proves that the open source app server market is 
</I>&gt;<i> there and there's a 
</I>&gt;<i> lot of interest in it. If somebody implemented an open source 
</I>&gt;<i> .NET app 
</I>&gt;<i> server, they could quite successfully ride the wave of 
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft marketing to 
</I>&gt;<i> reach those that wouldn't consider Microsoft otherwise.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Pavel.
