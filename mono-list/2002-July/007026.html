<PRE>This is why I think reimplementing wxWindows would be better.  It would
also not add additional requirements.  It would compile against
something the user should have (GTK+, Xlib, Motif, Aqua, Carbon, etc.) 
Of course, this runs into the problem of having to maintain the code
changes wxWindows has.

I'm just waiting for someone to say adding LGPL classes would be okay in
the BSD tree.

What do other people think about this approach?  I'd like to have a
cross-platform GUI, but I want to know what people think first. 
Especially if I'll have to go through all this stuff w/ making a C# dll
that platform invokes an externally C dll and internally C++ dll that
calls C++ dll (can anyone else say icky)
