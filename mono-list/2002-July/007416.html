You seem highly confused about what copyright means.
We are not copying their code (we don't even look at the rotor sources
like some other CLR implementations).

&gt;<i> 3) MS warned Mono not to infringe on its IP.
</I>
Everyone can do that. We do it, too, on our web site, we ask people to
not disassemble/decompile the ms implementation.

&gt;<i> 4) MS can sue (and/or threaten to sue) Mono and anyone who uses Mono if
</I>&gt;<i> MS?s IP is infringed upon
</I>
MS can sue (and/or threaten to sue) anyone.

&gt;<i> 5) MS does not ?like? Linux and Open Source:
</I>
Many people don't like ms, so what?

&gt;<i> 6) At any time MS can introduce a new patented feature into the
</I>&gt;<i> standardized part of .Net to make any implementation, including Mono,
</I>&gt;<i> to be incompatible with the one provided by MS.
</I>
Ask the ECMA people what they think about that.

&gt;<i> 8) Recent changes to the Mono license allow MS to hijack certain parts
</I>&gt;<i> of Mono, if so desired.
</I>
If you take a copy of a file from our corlib, surprise, we still got a
copy.

&gt;<i> With reference to the above:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Has Mono consulted with a competent legal advisor to make sure that
</I>&gt;<i> it does not *currently* infringe on MS?s IP?
</I>
Did you check with your competent legal advisor that the word &quot;.Net&quot; you
wrote in your email is a (pending) trademark of ms and that they may
require you to acknowledge that and god knows what else?

&gt;<i> 2) How does Mono plan to ensure that MS does not introduce a new,
</I>&gt;<i> patented feature into the standardized part of .Net, which would make
</I>&gt;<i> Mono implementation incompatible with one by MS?
</I>
We have infiltrated a bug in the bill gates office that will tickle him
any time he tries to do or approve such things. Pretty impressive
technology, if you ask me.

&gt;<i> 3) How does Mono plan to implement the bigger portion of .Net that is
</I>&gt;<i> not covered by the standard and is protected by MS?s patents and
</I>&gt;<i> copyright?
</I>
I use gvim, but some poor souls out there use emacs.

&gt;<i> 4) What options will Mono users have if Mono is sued and then shutdown
</I>&gt;<i> by MS?
</I>
What they should do anyway: tell their congressmen that the us patent
system is useless and/or move to free countries.
