<PRE>&gt;<i> Windows.Forms may be a moving target, making it is akin to writing an AWT
</I>&gt;<i> library with Swing being just around the corner.  Still, it appears that
</I>&gt;<i> Ximian is not only discouraging people from working on WinForms at this
</I>&gt;<i> point, but *ever* supporting WinForms. (I hope I'm wrong here)
</I>

Wether Ximian supports Windows.Forms or not is not the problem. After all
most of the higher level classes were done by non-Ximian-hackers while
Ximian focuses on low-level details. This is a perfect work-sharing, as the
low-level things are rather &quot;boring&quot;.

I'm _sure_ there will be Windows.Forms if there are enough people who want
that. I only think Ximian/Miguel should announce such things differnently,
as it might shock and discourage some people that hoped for the support.

If the OpenSource community creates Windows.Forms I'm sure mono will have
it.
If you want them try to help.

IMO no reason to be afraid of not reaching compatiblity to .NET.
