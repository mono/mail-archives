What about Libraries that exist for several platforms, e.g. OpenGL
exists as gl.dll under windows and as libgl.so (or similar) under Linux
with hopefully identical functionality?

(I know OpenGL is not too good an example since you need a lot of stuff
for setting up windows and there will probably be a standardized api
much like Java3d.)

IMHO, you should have made a registry-blackbox in the first place which
you would have easily exchanged for an emulation.

(Which one should do in most cases - make a wrapper so you can exchange
it - IMHO this is the way to keep cross-platform compatibility. Speed is
an issue here, but at least this registry case its not. And I would
trade speed for compatibility in a lot of cases.)

A standard api for some kind of registry isn't such a bad thing. It's
only bad if it gets stuffed with carloads of bullsh*t as it usually does
if it's global.
