I've seen plenty of complaints when the reply-to is set to the list, for
much the same set of reasons as is outlined on that summary page.

&gt;<i>

You could use &quot;reply to list&quot; instead, if your mailer can automatically
spot mailing lists.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) It makes incoming mail redirection more complicated. Which means you
</I>&gt;<i> have to use the '[mono-list]' crap, and I could write a whole we page on

</I>
Thats what the List-ID: header is for.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4) I'd say the 'reply-to-author' case is used less than 1% of the time.
</I>&gt;<i> Why make it a pain for the majority of us the majority of the time?

I've yet to see a mailer that doesn't have that feature.
