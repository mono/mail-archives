<PRE>First off, as I'm new to the list, let me congratulate everyone
involved with mono. It's really amazing how quickly this project
has matured. I never really paid much attention to .net as all
of my work is cross-platform, now that I've &quot;found&quot; mono, I am
really excited by the possibilities. My pet project is a C++
simulation framework that contains all kinds of ugly hacks in
order to make it extensible and scriptable, all of which would
go away if I could base it a .NET runtime instead.

My first test is to set up a runtime environment; a minimal
install that will support an application based on my framework.
So I built the standard C# &quot;Hello, world&quot;, put it on a clean
WinNT box and then tried to fix the errors. I ended up with a
directory with the following files:

   hello.exe          libintl-1.dll    libglib-1.3-12.dll
   monomono.exe       iconv.dll        libgmodule-1.3-12.dll
   libgc.dll          corlib.dll

However, I am getting the error &quot;The assembly corlib.dll was
not found or could not be loaded.&quot; Any idea why this is?

Thanks for the help,

Jason
