<PRE>&gt;<i> I think naming the files appropriately and commenting them thoroughly is
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps more important Miguel. The value of a test suite diminishes when no
</I>&gt;<i> one knows what is really being being tested without cross-ferencing each
</I>&gt;<i> test file to the ECMA spec.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
That is a detail about whoever would build such a test.  The current
test suite does not track the standard, it tracks the development as we
were testing new features in the compiler, and as we completed the
grammar.

It later became a test suite of bugs we found in the implementation, so
we would write a test case to ensure that the bug would remain fixed.
