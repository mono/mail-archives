<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; If someone is interested, please let me know, any help would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; greatly appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One other task that might be even more important is to write tests based
</I>&gt;<i> on the spec.  Basically the process goes like this:
</I>
I think naming the files appropriately and commenting them thoroughly is
perhaps more important Miguel. The value of a test suite diminishes when no
one knows what is really being being tested without cross-ferencing each
test file to the ECMA spec.

&gt;<i>    For each bit of the spec, try to exercise the statement, write plenty
</I>&gt;<i> of cases.  For each bit that is supposed to be prohibited, make a test
</I>&gt;<i> that exposes this case, and put those as a negative test.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    But basically, we need a better test suite than just the test we have
</I>&gt;<i> been developing: we need a thorough set of tests.  There are commercial
</I>&gt;<i> regression tests for the C# language, but they are too expensive, and
</I>&gt;<i> they are not free either.
