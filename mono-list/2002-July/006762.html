<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Who about writing to the registry? As I understand it, Linux does not have
</I>&gt;<i> a counterpart to the registry.  Should I avoid relying on that feature?
</I>&gt;<i> 	
</I>&gt;<i>     Try to avoid it. Although there would be a emulation for registry in
</I>&gt;<i> mono too. IMO GNOME does have a registry like mechanism for configuration.
</I>
Exactly.  Even if gnome has a configuration system similar to the
registry, the keys will not be equal, so you will probably end up having
to do some runtime detection, and depending on this load an assembly
that has your platform-specific hacks

Miguel.
