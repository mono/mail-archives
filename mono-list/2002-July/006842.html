I don't know how gtk looks on windows, but:
custom controls have the same look &amp; feel on every platform.

Even then, saying &quot;Windows.Forms&quot; is probably saying &quot;Windows.Feel&quot;. The
range of choices there is very narrow.

That ain't necessarily so. As has been pointed out earlier (by Miguel I
think), it will be very very painful to reemulate Windows.Forms interna
using an existing toolkit. And as I've said before, it may well proove
to be impossible due to the different concepts behind them.

I havn't much experience with gtk#, but I believe it is possible in gtk#
to have owner-drawn controls?

</I>
If the Win32 API is used, no chance. In that case, the developers have
just sacrificed cross-platform development. Yet I think that you don't
need native-code libs for GUI widgets at all. You only need to be able
to write a custom event handler (for which you need to emulate the
WndProc, which might proove impossible with an existing widget set).

Thus my proposal to write a wrapper dll for a new clean windowing
environment. And then re-emulate whatever is needed for Windows.Forms.

That way one can easily port Windows.Forms to other (new) windowing
systems (other than X or Win32). Of course, it is quiet low-level and
some speed is traded for cross-platform portability (at least at first).

If it is cleanly written, you can even allow for pluggable looks. (The
feel is probably fixed if you say Windows.Forms!)

(By the way, I don't like the look of GTK, so I would like to have a
Windows look. This is especially important if you want to mix standard
and custom components!)

&gt;<i> Most custom controls fall in the first 2 categories, and represent=20
