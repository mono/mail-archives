</I>&gt;<i> Notice that I am not ruling out Windows.Forms, but Ximian will not
</I>&gt;<i> likely devote resources to this task (unless we are hired to do it)
</I>&gt;<i> given the size of the problem.

&gt;<i>I had promised my friends they would be able to run winform apps
</I>&gt;<i>under linux in a short time :((
</I>
&gt;<i>I don't know how much effort is involved in porting winforms to
</I>&gt;<i>linux, but feel that mono would be incomplete without winforms support.

The lack of Windows.Forms in mono is going to be a bit of a downer, one of
the exciting things
about mono was finally a cross platform (other than java which I do not
like, sorry!) development environment for gui work using an accepted modern
language. There is delphi//kylix of course, but language snobbery means it's
not used as much as it should be. I've discovered that if one doesn't write
in C/C++ or Java, it doesn't matter how open source you are you'll be
ignored, hence I'm looking for a non-Java alternative for cross platform
work and mono seemed to be the most exciting project in terms of programmer
productivity. Hence my disappointment to hear that Windows.Forms is not
likely to be forth coming (ok I'm just a lurker here so I can't really
complain).

I understand that Windows.Forms is a quite immature at the moment, I've
tried it (compared say to Delphi's VCL) so maybe it's not the best route to
go down but what ever people chose to implement please please make it as
easy to use as Windows.Forms or Delphi's VCL. I know you linux guys like to
fiddle all day long with complicated and obscure code! :), but sometimes we
just want to get the job done as fast as possible.

However I think you're all doing an absolutely fantastic job and the mono
project, with or with out
Windows Forms is becoming a fine addition to our tool box of goodies. I'm in
the bioinformatics area
and I'd like to start a bioinformatics based project sometime in the near
future using mono (for windows
and linux and what ever else you guys crank out, eg Max OS X).
