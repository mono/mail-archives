<PRE>Hi,

I came accros a news about Mono project making progress, I started to
read more and I found this statememt by Bruce Perens, HP's Linux
strategist, regarding Mono and Samba: 

&quot;If we don't get that agreement [with MS], I'll be happy to see Ximian
implement this stuff, but I'm not sure I'll touch it. I'm also not sure
I want to let it touch the rest of GNOME very much because if GNOME
becomes dependent on it, it would have a potential weakness there.&quot; 

&quot;This means you cannot make a compatible implementation without
potentially infringing on a Microsoft patent. We went ahead and did it
anyway, and Microsoft hasn't enforced that patent, but it doesn't mean
they never will. This is a telling case as they've taken what was an
open protocol and deliberately put in a patent to close it and then
introduced the patented feature in all new systems.&quot; 

With reference to the above, 
1) Is there any agreement with MS about Mono?
2) If not, how does Mono project plan to address the above concerns?

Thanks in advance
