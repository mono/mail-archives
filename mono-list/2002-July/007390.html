Ok, if we trust such code we can use the objdump hack. Although
restoring the registers is still a big hack.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the optimizations for this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This approach would also avoid much code duplication. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So IMO we should first check if we gain anything by using gcc, and of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; course we need a solution for the exception problem? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the approach of using gcc is certainly interesting even if the

</I>&gt;<i> The primary purpouse of ngen-ed assemblies is to reduce startup and JIT
</I>&gt;<i> costs (microsoft itself documents ngen-assemblies being slower code-wise
</I>&gt;<i> than jitted code...). Of course, performance is an bonus:-), but I'm
</I>&gt;<i> very impressed with the first snapshot.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The gain in mcs compilation times, for example, seems to match
</I>&gt;<i> pretty well with the jit overhead as measured with mono --profile.
</I>&gt;<i> And, of course, mcs is not a good benchmark for native code quality.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of the current limitations, the .ovf opcodes seems only a matter of
</I>&gt;<i> (boring) programming, mostly. The exception handling stuff is certainly
</I>&gt;<i> harder and if done using the C++ exception tables, it will

</I>&gt;<i> checked and methods with exception tables are less than 7% in mcs and
</I>&gt;<i> less than 2% in corlib, so even if 5% of the methods still need to be

</I>
good news ;-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My main concern with using gcc is that we might not be able to constrain
</I>&gt;<i> the gcc optimizer to obey the CLR rules (Zoltan notes the problem with
</I>&gt;<i> division by 0, for example). Using the JIT to output the code would give
</I>&gt;<i> us better control on such issues, but researching these issues is the
</I>&gt;<i> only way to find out if the concept works:-)
</I>
So I think everybody agrees that it would be nice to have a native code
generator, so integrating that code into the sources should be the goal.
All I am concerned about it to avoid code duplication, which makes it
hard to maintain that code. I would like to share as much code as
possible with the JIT.

Unfortunately the current patch is much to large to integrate. What we
need is a bunch of smaller patches which we can integrate into our
codebase.
