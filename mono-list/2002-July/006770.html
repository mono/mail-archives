From what I understand the wrapper dependant code will be quite substantial, 
so they'll require quite a bit more than a few conditional #ifs.  I prefer 
the current setup, ie a stubbed version of Windows.Forms and then toolkit 
dependant implementations.  No reason to add a bunch of complexity to the 
process.

As far as Qt# goes, this is all speculation because the binding is just not 
ready yet.  I believe Gtk# is quite a bit further along, so I think we'll 
wait and see how Mike and Rachel write the wrapper and hopefully learn from 
them.

BTW, when Qt# is ready I wonder whether the Windows.Forms wrapper should be 
created in Mono's cvs or somewhere else?  Mono's cvs would centralize the 
work, but this would require a dependancy on Qt# (which in turn requires qtc 
;-) which is in kde's cvs at the moment.

Cheers,

Adam
