This is not entirely true. Mono is concerned with obtaining a true ECMA CLR 
environment, but it is also concerned with emulating *other* MS technologies.  

Regardless, these questions of legality and future MS patent threats have been 
hashed to death.  Suffice it to say that these questions have been asked and 
answered.  Anyone wishing to pursue this further should consult the archives 
or ponder on another mailing list.

Cheers,
