Put this way, I could not agree with you more.

J2EE (and JBoss) will still have their users. A ligthweidht (ligther than 
J2EE, that is) Mono-based app server that isn't necessarily an exact clone of 
.NET would really hit the sweet spot for those who presently use J2EE to 
build JSP-based websites.
