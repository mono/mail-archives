<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> I disagree.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First, the Java Abstract Windowing Toolkit (AWT) has no its own Look and
</I>&gt;<i> Feel. Widows AWT implementation uses native Win32 widgets, and
</I>&gt;<i> Unix/Linux AWT implementation uses Motif.
</I>
The issue with people that used Swing is that for some reason, every
Swing programmer felt the need to add 3 menu entries to have the user
configure the favorite look or default to Metal, because it looks
cooler.

I can understand this, as people on the Windows and Motif worlds have
had very few choices of look and feel, so they felt like their
applications *had* to be different.  I do not blame them for trying to
get some fresh air in that constrained world.

Those of us in the GNOME/KDE worlds have enjoyed of variety in our UIs
but with the added benefit of uniformity across the applications on the
desktop.

A good Swing UI is one that will just use the native look and feel to
integrate with the rest of the desktop.  That being said, if you are
interested in doing *good* UIs, you want to read Joel's UI book for
Programmers (www.joelonsoftware.com has the details).
