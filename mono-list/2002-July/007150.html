 Hi,

 It is Great to see efforts to port ASP.NET to Linux.
 Just Curious ! Can mono run the WebMatrix ?

 <A HREF="http://www.asp.net/webmatrix/">http://www.asp.net/webmatrix/</A>

 Or do we have anything like it from SharpDevelop Project ?


 Regards,
 Kumaraguru
 Web Developer.

Hi

&gt;<i> I have never written GUI apps in Linux but I thought maybe I could
</I>&gt;<i> write a GUI Editor like Visual Studio Dot NET that could do ASP.Net 
</I>&gt;<i> and ADO.Net. Since the form elements are at least a year out from the 
</I>&gt;<i> looks of it. What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will start looking into GNOME and X windows Development, in the mean
</I>time.
&gt;<i>

If you're interrested in writing a IDE for .NET please join the
SharpDevelop project. We need contributors and coders. SharpDevelop is
designed with portability in mind. When Mono &amp; GTK# will run well, we'll
port it over to linux. Currently the dialogs get converted to a xml
format, which could be used with GTK# too (XSL transform), this make it
easier to switch the GUI APIs and the basic 'GUI' functionalaty is made
abstract and has a very high level 'interface' which should map to any
GUI API system. Some controls and classes must be ported by hand and
currently not all dialogs are in the xml format.

For the port we could need some help too :)

I'm currently writing more documentation and examples to make it easier
for other people to contribute and understand the project. Soon it will
be much easier to get into it and coding something productive for it. I
think it is better to concentrate on a single development environment to
compete with VS.NET, because it is a huge development effort and it is
better to have ONE really good IDE than to have five kdevelop clones
which are full of bugs and can't even compete with jedit in terms of
project management, editor etc.

cya
