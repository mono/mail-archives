.mono folks,

First I should say that I was raised on windows.  I'm self employed and =
write my business solutions in VB.  Why? Easy, RAD, Ubiquitous.  When I =
found out that a project done in the .NET scope could in the future run =
on a Linux system - BOOM - downloaded my first three distros to see =
which one was going to replace all of my windows systems (20 copies of =
windows, office, etc can get pretty spendy).  Anyway I think you guys =
are up to something sweet.  I'm redoing my business apps in VB.NET and =
will deploy them on our Wintel systems until that fateful day when mono =
sets my office F R E E  (PUN VERY MUCH INTENDED!!!).

I think one thing that would greatly improve your site is a discussion =
board.  People like myself who are unfamiliar with all of the Linux talk =
need help every-now-and-again.  There are lots of places to read about =
your work but no good discussions.  I have no where to go for help/info; =
No one in town even knows what the heck .mono is even after explaining =
it.

Lastly, I have a few questions.  I truthfully don't expect anyone to =
answer my questions, as you probably get many, however, here I go! (and =
these my seem dumb)
    What do I need to watch out for when programming in VB.NET so that =
I'm sure to be able to run those apps on Linux?
    Will I be able to use Microsoft SQL Server 2000 or will I need to =
switch to a specific Open Source Database.  Will I need to recode?
    Will built-in reporting be supported for crystal reports?  This is a =
heavily used part of our system.
    Who about writing to the registry? As I understand it, Linux does =
not have a counterpart to the registry.  Should I avoid relying on that =
feature?

I could go on (but not without felling like I'm taking advantage of =
someone's kindness).  If I knew where to get this type of information I =
could accelerate the rate of development of our app and not trouble you =
with these questions.

Thanks for letting me chatter,
Gabriel
