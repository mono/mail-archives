	Well - on further reflection, I don't see why (particularly) there
should be any real problem with overloaded methods - it could be
possible for a delegate to map to a set of methods, until Invoke time -
surely ?

	? you need the type information anyway to marshal the arguments
generically, and the 'Delegate' encodes that anyhow - surely ?

&gt;<i> Do you mean &quot;coerce a method name to a delegate&quot;? Delegates are distinct

</I>&gt;<i> AFAIK, (except boxing) it would be a sole case of runtime object creation
</I>&gt;<i> without new keyword, and would require another syntax anyway to indicate the
</I>&gt;<i> coercion. Too inconsistent, IMHO.
</I>
	Hmm; a Delegate is a very basic type, I don't think the argument is
good that a new keyword should be included.

	But I guess I need to stop complaining about the language, since
there's almost nothing that can be done about it.

	Hmm,

		Michael.
