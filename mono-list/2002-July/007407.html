<PRE>Managed C++ libraries aren't very portable at all. The compiler
generates x86 code for some parts. :-/ Further, I'd guess any sort of
OpenGL implementation uses P/Invoke. :-( To get such a thing to work one
would have to make platform-specific libraries. Although, in my opinion,
this would probably be the best thing to do anyway. Perhaps suggest to
the author having the main library check the platform and then load a
platform-specific DLL which communicates with the main library through
interfaces. This could all be done in a static constructor. But the
library is probably not implemented in such a way.
 
Have a nice day :)

And so, I come to my next question: Why can't csgl run on Mono?
