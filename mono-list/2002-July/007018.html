<PRE>Grrr... always send from the wrong account.

</I>&gt;<i> This is why I think reimplementing wxWindows would be better.  It would
</I>&gt;<i> also not add additional requirements.  It would compile against
</I>&gt;<i> something the user should have (GTK+, Xlib, Motif, Aqua, Carbon, etc.) 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, this runs into the problem of having to maintain the code
</I>&gt;<i> changes wxWindows has.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm just waiting for someone to say adding LGPL classes would be okay in
</I>&gt;<i> the BSD tree.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do other people think about this approach?  I'd like to have a
</I>&gt;<i> cross-platform GUI, but I want to know what people think first. 
</I>&gt;<i> Especially if I'll have to go through all this stuff w/ making a C# dll
</I>&gt;<i> that platform invokes an externally C dll and internally C++ dll that
</I>&gt;<i> calls C++ dll (can anyone else say icky)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Have you looked at some of the other bindings that call C++ from C#? One 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; example is Qt#. It's a work in progress, but the basic concepts of using a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; C++ based toolkit from C# are working. There are many other examples, such as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; WxPython and QtJava.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The bindings that I have looked at use a two-level approach. The first level 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is a set of C functions. There are one or more C functions that perform 'new 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; WhateverObject' and then return the result, and there are other C functions 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that simply call the C++ function. Thiis lower level is compiled #extern &quot;C&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so that name mangling is not performed. The second level consists of a set of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; C# methods that call the C functions. In the case of Qt#, the C functions are 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; provided by another library QtC.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I believe it is possible to minimize (probably not eliminate) the C layer, but 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the C functions that perform the 'new' for C++ objects are difficult to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; eliminate. The other two complications of calling C++ directly are that the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compiler does name-mangling on the C++ methods, and the fact that virtual 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; methods only appear as methods on the base class.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I have been looking at wxWindows for quite some time.  I don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; think I personally want to deal with importing C++ classes and looking
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; at them as structs.  This seems very, very painful.  Unless someone can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; explain an easier way to platform invoke these, I don't think this will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; work.
