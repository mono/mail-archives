<PRE>Hi all,

I noticed the following on go-mono

&gt;<i>Gonzalo is now running the sample ASP.NET applications on Linux with the
</I>Mono runtime. It still needs polishing though, and help with the various
ASP.NET controls would be appreciated. The ASP.NET &gt;community seems more
poor than the PHP community, we need to have a few open source controls to
do things dynamic rendering (libart+gdk-pixbuf again can do most of the
work), charts and components &gt;like the kind of thing you see in the PHP
universe: to bring nice GPL code to the masses of Windows developers, lure
them into the world of Linux. 

I would loveto help in this respect and I have a few questions :)  

Will asp.net support in Mono run on Windows ?

Will C# be the target language for components or will the VB.NET runtime
allow developers to use VB ?

What is the aims of this project, to port all the components that ship with
the commerical version of asp.net i.e. buttons, datagrid, datalist, calender
etc ?

I agree the PHP guys have a huge component following and I agree that
asp.net could do the same, I would not however say its poorly done its just
that many people tend to sell what they do :) To this end I think we need
really encourage folks to start developing components with C# and the
asp.net support in Mono, create documentation, samples etc etc and get the
resources up on go-mono.

Andrew
