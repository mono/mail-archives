<PRE>Well this got accedently posted to the cvs list.
Someone else pointed out this error and I just want to foward it to
correct list.

He helped with the last part of the message, but if others want to
chime in go ahead.

</I>&gt;<i> Kaloian.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I should have made clear that part of the Feel is responsivness of the UI.
</I>&gt;<i> Having programmed using AWT, and somewhat in Swing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most people have said that it doesn't feel like a native app.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The other issue is Menu layout.  No matter how much work you go
</I>&gt;<i> into the menu layout, one of the groups will complain about it.
</I>&gt;<i> that the Layout is different than what they are use to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But on that note, there are complaints that even Win Forms don't have
</I>&gt;<i> the responsiveness that people expect from the platform. (on windows
</I>&gt;<i> that is)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But back to mono.  Winforms shouldn't be the universal UI if it was ever
</I>&gt;<i> chosen to be.  MS has tied it to closely to parts of the OS that are not
</I>&gt;<i> available (perhaps in WINE, but not in general)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And each OS has it's own quirks.  How a menu is set up. and other small
</I>&gt;<i> features that make up the entire UI.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will tell you one that that intrigues me, and I would probably just program
</I>&gt;<i> with it if it works out.  I need support for dyanmic change UI.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An example would be thus.  I need to support multiple cultures within the same
</I>&gt;<i> software.  (IOW, it can't be locked down in the compiled code)  I was looking
</I>at
&gt;<i> mozilla as a front end.  But if GTK# basically can do the same thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Allow the UI to change according a culture by culture basis. but not
</I>&gt;<i> universally,
</I>&gt;<i> on a Data element basis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example.  If I have a database of addresses, you have the common US
</I>address
&gt;<i> format and data entry tabs etc.  But for the Ukraine where the layout is
</I>&gt;<i> basically
</I>&gt;<i> reversed.  That is the type of thing I am looking at.  The statement that
</I>Pango
&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> GTK+ dynamically support translations by adjusting the size on a per language
</I>&gt;<i> basis also peaked my insterest.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> any comments??
</I>&gt;<i>
