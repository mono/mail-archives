<PRE>I think that would be usuful to know to all of you that for using Mono classes instead of MS's, e.g. System.Xml package, you just have to add the project contained in the directory e.g. System.Xml and then, in the AssemblyInfo.cs file generated by VS.NET for your project:
- Change the statement [assembly: System.CLSCompliant(true)] with [assembly: System.CLSCompliant(false)] (if present)
- Just comment the lines:
[assembly: AssemblyDelaySign(false)]
[assembly: AssemblyKeyFile(@&quot;..\..\..\jabbernet.key&quot;)]
[assembly: AssemblyKeyName(&quot;&quot;)]
 
I suggest to write a note about this in the &quot;contributing&quot; page, so that who is not familiar with the C# signing procedure can contribute and debug mono classes from the VS.NET development environment (which is very nice!)
 
Bye,
   Francesco

	&gt; I am quite new to mono developing. I was trying to make mono run a c# library that makes simpler to write client server programs that exchange xml streams (it is called jabber.net).
	&gt; My problem is that since both System.dll and System.Xml.dll classes needs some more methods to make all the stuff work.
	&gt; My idea was to provide first the code to System.Xml package and then to the other.
	&gt; Now my question is: is there a well know way to only use System.Xml classes provided by mono, so that it is possible to make them somehow more complete?
	&gt; My idea was to make a VS.NET solution and include as projects both the library and the System.Xml.dll project file: is that the best way (sure at the beginning, when the compiler was not self hosting, you made something similar...)?
	&gt;
	
	I believe Jason and Krall did check in VS.NET files that you can use to
	compile our System.XML and even to run the System.XML tests (which is
	way cool, and way simple)
