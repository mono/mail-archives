&gt;<i> I know Mark Crichton brought up this idea a while back, but it wasn't

</I>&gt;<i> to work on such a project, it would be wonderful.

I originally looked at Rhino as a way to quickly get a JS compiler for
IL.

I then realized that was a very bad idea.  Rhino is strongly tied to
the JVM and Java classes.  Trying to port it over wouldn't be as simple
as, say, porting JOrbis to C#.  If your final goal is a JS runtime for
IL, then IMNSHO, Rhino is *not* the right way to go.

Also, after talking with the Mozilla people, the JS2 engine would be
much more suited for compiling JavaScript to IL, however there are
issues of writing some runtime support that needs to be done.

So, if I was you, I'd pick to some other Java app to port over,
especially if your final goal is getting JS on Mono.  I can give people
pointers to what one would need to look into on JS2 to get it working
with Mono.

Thanks,
Mark Crichton
