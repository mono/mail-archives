Hi,

I'm still working on the C# to C++ output module for mcs.  The changes =
to &quot;Mint&quot;, and &quot;Mono&quot; are now complete (at least for the version of Mono =
and Mint I have), and they are very minor.   Both Mint and Mono now can =
freely incorporate, create, call, and be called by C++ classes, and C++ =
statically compiled classes are now incorporated directly into the Mono =
runtime as managed types.  The overhead for a Jit to C++ call is minor, =
and there is absolutely no overhead for the C++ to Jit calls.

The mono to C++ bindings and integration are accomplished through a =
change in the mono vtable layout.  I made mono's vtable extend backwards =
from the front of the vtable structure with -slot vtable indexes, while =
c++'s vtable extends forwards after the mono vtable info with normal =
positive indexes. =20

I also made a special platform dependent module which extracts a classes =
vtable and method pointers is used to register the C++'s methods as mono =
&quot;internal&quot; methods, and also give mono the layout of the C++'s vtable so =
that mono can build the correct hybrid mono/c++ vtables when it =
instantiates a c++ class.  In the hybrid system, mono is responsible for =
allocating and building all objects, both C++ and managed, but as far as =
mono is concerned there is no difference between the two.  I think this =
should also work with practically any C++ compiler, though the user will =
have to make a small interface to extract the method and vtable =
pointers.

The C++ to mono bindings use macros which utilize C's variable length =
argument list (...) format and function pointer semantics to simply get =
the mono vtable function adress, and call it with the arguments to the =
C++ version of the function.  This compiles down into a very very nice =
inline call in C++ that is really no different than calling a native C++ =
method, except that the target of the call may be a trampolined Jit =
compiled method or an interpreted method.

There was a bug in the mono trampoline code (eax,edx,ecx were out of =
order), but since this code has been replaced in the latest version, the =
problem is moot.  Also, I had to actually make the Mint system create =
real native calls for the vtable.. the version I had was just placing =
mono &quot;method&quot; pointers in the vtable slots.

Finally, I converted both &quot;mono&quot; and &quot;mint&quot; into statically linkable =
libraries with the expedient of changing their &quot;main()&quot; functions to =
&quot;mono()&quot; and &quot;mint()&quot; respectively when MONO_LIB or MINT_LIB was =
defined.

My test program works as follows...

The program initializes, and all global constructors for the =
&quot;Mono_Cpp::RegClass&quot; classes add themselves to the void =
(*mono_initialize_callback)() function pointer I added in order for mono =
to call them back during mono's initialization.

The &quot;main&quot; method of my program is called.  I simply call create a 2 =
element array for mono's argv[] array with the name of my internal =
metadata image file as the image to run (i.e. const char* _argv[] =3D { =
argv[0], &quot;internal:\\MyTest.exe&quot; }; mono(2, _argv); )  Mono then begins =
as if it had been run from the command line with &quot;internal:\\MyTest.exe&quot; =
as the image to run.

Mono then initializes, and after it loads up and initializes =
&quot;corlib.dll&quot; it calls back my registration classes.  Then the linked =
list of Registration classes each register the c++ vtable, c++ method =
pointers for each C++ class, and for the entrypoint class, the metadata =
binary image for the assembly.  The metadata binary image is simply a =
CIL compiled template of the assembly (in my case &quot;Test.exe&quot;) with all =
methods marked as &quot;internal calls&quot;.

Then mono proceeds on normall.. searches for an entry point.. finds it =
in my dummy metadata, calls it, executes my C++ main funciton with an =
internal call, I then call System::Console::WriteLine() from inside my =
test program, and I get &quot;Hello World!&quot;.  Tada.

------------------------------------------------------------

Right now I am finishing up the jitbindgen.c program which will process =
a mono assembly and generate .h files with the C++ to Jit bindings.  =
I've done this by hand in my test programs, but I need to automate to =
get the whole library.  At that point, you will be able to code by hand =
a C++ program that can utilize the CLR class runtime using C++.   After =
that, it's just back to finishing up the C# to C++ translator.

Ben
