<PRE>&lt;Troll&gt;Top posting just to annoy everyone :-)&lt;/TROLL&gt;

Pine, Lookout[1] and eudora spring to mind.

I'm sure there are others that don't follow &quot;the spec&quot;.

And yes, when I use exim mailfilters, and mutt, I do set up mailing list
stuff correctly, but I don't want to start a holy war about email clients,
and the number of windows machines on desktops etc.

My original post only mentioned it in passing, since I know it is an
annoyance, and the cause of off mailing list emails - I've had several
direct replies to my comments - I refuse to cc my replies to the list
because they might have been taken off-list for a reason.

To summarise: swings and roundabouts, it was just a suggestion, no need 
for a huge thread, a simple &quot;no&quot; or call for a vote by the list maintainer
was required :-)

Best Regards,

Simon
