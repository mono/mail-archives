<PRE>Still it's fair comment, many more people will have downloaded mono,
not got it to work (with their buggy Redhat compilers? etc etc etc)
and thing &quot;bad monos cr*p etc.

However I belive 0.12 is a good place to start - it has some bugs - but
enough to run some simple tests that I've given it. The website didn't
give me any illusions of how mature the product was.

In fact the general advice of &quot;getting the latest stuff from cvs&quot; should
be enough to warn anyone that the product is still in heavy development
and caveat emptor.

Still I'm impressed greatly, and the friendly courteous replies to my mostly
annoyingly newbie question on irc by miguel, raciel, baulig, alp, duncan and
gonzalo (sorry if I've missed anyone out :-) has changed me from eyeing .NET
technology with suspicion, and thinking java will out-last it to someone who
is very close to activly advocating it. I can see my M$ friends saying &quot;I
told
you so&quot; too. - at least I've converted some of them to linux :-)

Excuse the spelling I think I'm coming down with something :(

Regards,

Simon

&gt;<i> True, as long as the announcement is made on the go-mono home page, the
</I>&gt;<i> release works with the latest runtime release, and good instructions on
</I>&gt;<i> how to set everything up is included in the announcement and
</I>&gt;<i> distribution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, though, the easier you make things for the end-user the more
</I>&gt;<i> likely they are to be successful quickly with the technology and be
</I>&gt;<i> encouraged to continue their use/experimentation.  Many people have
</I>&gt;<i> short attention spans when trying out new technology and once burned are
</I>&gt;<i> even less likely to try the technology again later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (I know many potential Linux converts who tried it too soon and have
</I>&gt;<i> set-in-stone opinions now about it's viability.  I know this doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> reflect the general nature of those who inhabit the mono community but
</I>&gt;<i> the more press exposure mono gets the more incumbent it is to make the
</I>&gt;<i> technology easy to use.  People will start to visit the technology and
</I>&gt;<i> if they find it a difficult proposition (compared to a setup.exe install
</I>&gt;<i> on windows perhaps and some double-clickable samples) they may pass on
</I>&gt;<i> it and, worse, share their negative experiences with their peers.  I've
</I>&gt;<i> seen this in the real world especially in regards to desktop Linux and
</I>&gt;<i> it's frustrating.  Mono will always be great for me but I'd sure love to
</I>&gt;<i> see it succeed wildly in the mainstream and help boost Linux!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for the diatribe!  I'll go back to lurking on the list now...  :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Will
