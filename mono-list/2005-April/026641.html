<PRE>Hi,

I'm currently trying to get into Gtk#, but I have hit some obstacles. I 
would be very happy if someone could provide me with some links or an 
explanation for these things:

1. Menu accelerators. It seems that Gtk# uses something similar to 
ImageLists for keyboard accelerators for menu items. Is this true? And 
how to use these accelerators? I haven't found any documentation on it 
that I am able to use.

2. Gtk# in Windows. How exactly should one setup a Gtk# project in 
Windows? I have installed Mono for Windows, which includes Gtk#. 
However, the Gtk# assemblies did not appear in the GAC, so I linked to 
the gtk-sharp assemblies (and some others) in the Mono program folder. 
This did not succeed, as I kept getting DllNotFoundExceptions about a 
glue dll.

3. The TreeView. I have used the TreeView a bit and it rocks! I'd just 
like to know whether it is possible to let one item span the entire row 
(ie, not bound to columns).

Any help would be appreciated,
Thanks!

Sijmen Mulder
