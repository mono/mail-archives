It seems all the confusion is due to my misunderstanding of your words
(and my bad english). I thought that you meant *must* instead of *can*.
Mea culpa.

So again, we agree on this point. My point is that we shouldn't over
simplificate our words when talking to somebody coming from the
proprietary software world about the different ways to distribute FOSS
software. I think that the answer to the following question :

&quot;Was wondering if anybody could tell me of any instances where=20
proprietary software has been developed using Mono? &quot;

which was :

&quot;The FAQ explicitly states that you can write commercial programs with
Mono&quot;

might confuse things a little bit by creating an identity relationship
between commercial and proprietary software, which are two differents
things (as you clearly mentionned above).
