<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Hi!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What is the current status of the FC3 packages?
</I>&gt;<i> I wasn't able to upgrade to 1.1.5 and now 1.1.6 has the same problems 
</I>&gt;<i> (1.1.4 worked fine)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yum returns an error:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.6/fedora-3-i386/repodata/repomd.xml:">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.6/fedora-3-i386/repodata/repomd.xml:</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> [Errno 4] IOError: HTTP Error 404: Not Found
</I>&gt;<i> Trying other mirror.
</I>&gt;<i> Cannot open/read repomd.xml file for repository: Mono new
</I>&gt;<i> failure: repodata/repomd.xml from Mono new: [Errno 256] No more mirrors 
</I>&gt;<i> to try.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore there again are no gtk# and xsp packages.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When can next *full* and *working* 1.1 release be expected?
</I>
Gtk# and XSP must be obtained from the 1.0.x directories.

We are not really Yum users, so we do not know what needs to be done to
fix these issues.  Duncan claims that everything is fixed, I would not
know how to do it.

You might want to download all the packages manually (mono-all.zip) and
install those from the command line.

I do not like the current setup where pieces are obtained from 1.0.x and
pieces from 1.1.x;  We are trying to come up with a solution, but
nothing is available at this point.

</PRE>
