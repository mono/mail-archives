<PRE>Hi!

We are pleased to announce the release of X-develop Professional 1.0,
our cross-platform multi-language IDE for Mono, Java and .NET. X-develop
is the first IDE to offer features like on-the-fly error checking,
refactoring and smart code templates for C# and VB.net developers using
Mono.

More information and a trial version of X-develop are now available from
<A HREF="http://www.x-develop.com">http://www.x-develop.com</A>


Feature showcase:

* VS.net 2003/2005 compatibility

X-develop can read and write solutions and projects from VS.net 2003 and
2005. Solutions/projects created for Windows can be loaded and modified
with X-develop on Linux. X-develop can build VS.net 2003/2005
solutions/projects with Mono on Windows and Linux.

* Instant detection of errors throughout all files

No need to compile in order to find out if there are errors. X-develop
checks all files in the solution on-the-fly in the background and
displays errors in an instant.

* Refactoring

X-develop includes refactorings for renaming variables, methods,
classes, changing method signature, extracting methods and more.

* Productivity features

X-develop boosts productivity with coding tools such as Organize
imports, Usage search, Code formatting, Smart templates, Go to class, Go
to symbol and more.

* Framework switching

With X-develop the developer can switch between installed framework
versions (.NET 1.1/2.0, Mono) during development

* Debugging

An experimental Mono debugger is supported on Linux x86 if the
Mono.Debugger assembly is installed.


Best regards,


Hans
