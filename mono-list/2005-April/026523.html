Nice.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some of the major problems encountered during the port were;

Ilya fixed this issue.

&gt;<i> - ALOT of trouble with differences in what I would call the current

</I>&gt;<i> Solution (really work around) - change ALL Server.Transfer calls to 
</I>&gt;<i> Response.Redirect (whether this is a better approach anyway is debatable)
</I>
Some fixes went into that code after 1.1.4. Probably your issues are
solved now. In any case, if you have small test cases that fail, I would
be more than happy to see those in bugzilla and fix them.

&gt;<i> - problems with libraries compiled under MS .net framework not being

</I>
May be they reference an assembly that does not exist in mono or they
are compiled with the 'Incremental compilation' flag.
