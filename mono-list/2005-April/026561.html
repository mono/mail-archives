<PRE>That Active Directory uses a proprietary protocol isn't exactly true.
Client access and management access happens over LDAP. There is an API
on Windows called ADSI, which is essentially just a simpler LDAP API,
geared towards the specific schema AD uses.

&gt;<i>From the Microsoft glossary:
</I>
L
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) -- a protocol used to
access a directory service. LDAP support is currently being implemented
in Web browsers and e-mail programs, which can query an LDAP-compliant
directory. LDAP is a simplified version of the Directory Access Protocol
(DAP), which is used to gain access to X.500 directories. It is easier
to code the query in LDAP than in DAP, but LDAP is less comprehensive.
For example, DAP can initiate searches on other servers if an address is
not found, while LDAP cannot in its initial specification. Lightweight
Access Directory Protocol is the primary access protocol for Active
Directory. 


Of course, they have some &quot;extensions&quot;, such as ACL support and such.

You should be able to fully admin an AD with LDAP.

It's worth noting the default configuration of AD is not to allow
anonymous connections. You must be SASL authenticated, preferably using
GSSAPI.
