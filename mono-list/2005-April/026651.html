Mono will do that when Microsoft stands behind SWF[1]. :-D

Which is to say, No, Never, and You Must Be Kidding, Right[2]?

Gtk# is, and will continue to be, the &quot;official&quot; toolkit of Mono, as
much as Mono has an official toolkit, anyway.  Why?  Because Mono was
developed by a bunch of Gnome hackers who wanted to simplify Gnome
development, and GTK+ is the toolkit of Gnome. :-)

This isn't entirely true; there is also development on Cocoa# for better
Mac OS X integration.

So the closest to an &quot;official&quot; position would probably be this: design
your code to utilize multiple different front-ends so that you can
better integrate with all of your target platforms.  This implies having
Gtk#, SWF, and Cocoa# GUIs, if desired.  Is this more work?  Yes.  But
your users will prefer it.  (For proof, just see the history of cross-
platform toolkits between Mac OS and Windows.  The users tended to
prefer Mac-native front-ends in almost all cases.  Even now, I hear
grumbling from users that Qt programs don't look &quot;quite right&quot; on the
Mac, because buttons are the wrong size and other subtle issues.)

Of course, what developer wants to support three (or more) different
code bases?  None.  But that's another matter....

[1] Microsoft has stated that Avalon is the future, and SWF has no long-
term future.  At least, that's my current interpretation of their
statements.  There will be some work to make it possible to use Avalon
from SWF and vice-versa, but Avalon will be preferred, make no mistake.

[2] Plus, if Mono dropped Gtk# Mono would be crucified by Free Software
users because of the ever-present cry, &quot;what about patents?!&quot;  With Gtk#
we can better insulate our users from any potential issues and provide
an alternative.  Plus, SWF sucks[3] (no box layout, difficult i18n and
l10n, and various other issues).

[3] Yes, this is intended to start flames. :-)
