<PRE>  Simon, when your application is ready to be revealed it might make a good
case study for mono.

  Speaking of case studies, I think perhaps having a few of the mono based
products Miguel mentioned should become case studies on the mono wiki
website.  Put a case study link right in the navigation menu.  Make it very
easy to see.  Yes, there's always linking to the product sites instead,
however they often gloss over the technology involved and focus on marketing
hype.
  Case studies, however, can communicate a different perspective and be
geared more toward those who want to know how the technology was implemented
in a solution, the challenges involved, and the end results.  Case studies
should not be pure marketing hype.
  Screenshots are nice, but they tell you very, very little.  However,
combine them with case studies and now the pictures really do speak a
thousand words. Finding out how the mono technology was applied and its'
value to a product and its' end users are important to hear during the
evaluation process.  I've said this before, it's more than just developers
that are evaluating mono.
  For those who say, oh shut up and just &quot;google&quot; the information you're
looking for, well wouldn't you rather google find the information on the
mono site than on some confusing crapola site?  I sure would.
  I like the videos, but audio narration would make them much nicer.  It can
be difficult to follow the context of the presentation without audio
narration.  Learnvisualstudio.net, for instance, does a good job with this.
  I know, I should up about this, but I just can't stand seeing .php
extensions on the mono wiki site.  Grrr!  Showoff mod_mono and get a .NET
wiki in there already!  Sorry, I've been holding that one in too long. 8^]

Regards,
Dan Maltes

Subject: [Mono-list] successful port of MS .net application to
linux/apache/mono1.1.4

Ive recently successfully ported an ASP.Net application from MS .net to
mono-1.1.4.

This application was approximately 250-300 days development, is currently
deployed and in production on windows server 2003, has 2 external interfaces
and used an MS SQL server database. 

As an experiment I ported it to mono and mysql in approximately 20 hours,
and had it running under apache on an ubuntu linux box.

The application used a number of 3rd party libraries including nHibernate
and wilson master pages.

Some of the major problems encountered during the port were;
- trouble with mulitple cookies and the FormsAuthentication cookie
disappearing. - not sure what the problem was, made work around.
- ALOT of trouble with differences in what I would call the current
executing path of pages and the inclusion of user controls.  It appears that
IIS executes pages in a different path to apache/mod_mono and this causes
the page directives at the top of the aspx file to be incorrect.  
Solution (really work around) - change ALL Server.Transfer calls to
Response.Redirect (whether this is a better approach anyway is debatable)
- problems with libraries compiled under MS .net framework not being
compatable with those compiled under mono.  I am not sure what the expected
compability between things compiled under mono and MS are but ive found that
if you can get the source for something, try and compile it under mono, it
will cause you less trouble in the end.

Apart from that the port was successful, and relatively painless.

Unfortunately this forum is not the place for me to say what the application
is (at this time).

The next task is to find 2 identical boxes, deploy under both win2k3 and
linux/mono and load test both to see the results.  Only problem being i dont
have 2 identical boxes :(

Simon
