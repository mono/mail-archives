</I>I'm not a SuSE user (Used 9.1 when SuSE still felt free... now it just 
feels like they want my money, which isn't abnormal or queer, but 
still), but I would assume that a 9.1 package will work fine in 9.2.  
Unless there are major differences in the structure (i.e. installing 
binaries to /usr/local/bin rather than /usr/bin or something) a package 
is theoretically compatible with any Linux system of the same 
architecture.  SuSE 9.1 and 9.2 are most likely nearly identical in 
system structure, except for probably having difference versions of some 
core system components (Like glibc) that could cause compatibility issues.
