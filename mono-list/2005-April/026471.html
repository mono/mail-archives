They are separate and related terms.

Commercial: Can be sold on the commercial market.
Proprietary: Source is not published

So you can have:

Commercial+Proprietary: Microsoft software
Commercial+!Proprietary: Free/Open-Source Software
!Commercial+Proprietary: e.g. Educational-only proprietary software?
!Commercial+!Proprietary: e.g. Educational-only Source Code?

Generally speaking, if it's non-commercial it would be considered to be
proprietary, even if source code is present, as the non-commercial
aspect greatly limits the target audience (why work on something you
can't possibly sell?).  I haven't seen much non-commercial software
anywhere.

&gt;<i> Does the ability to write commercial programs imply that you can make
</I>&gt;<i> them proprietary ?
</I>
For a majority of companies, Commercial and Proprietary are one and the
same, as a majority of companies aren't FOSS companies.  So there is a
strong implication that the ability to write commercial programs means
you can write proprietary programs, which is why it usually isn't
necessary to explicitly state that proprietary programs are allowed.
