<PRE>Was wondering if anybody could tell me of any instances where 
proprietary software has been developed using Mono?  I'm trying to sell 
some of my bosses at work about the merits of Mono, but one is worried 
about the &quot;viral&quot; nature of free software.  I'm fairly certain that as 
Mono's class libraries are released under MIT's X11 license, there 
shouldn't be any problems developing and selling proprietary code on 
top of Mono, but a few case examples might be good to set my boss' mind 
at ease.  Thanks alot.
