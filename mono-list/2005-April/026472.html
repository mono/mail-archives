Well, it seems to me that many FOSS projects do it.=20

What does make such FOSS projects as gcc, the autotools, GNOME, Apache,
OpenLDAP, and so on inherently commercial to you ?

My point is that, even if in most situations, the proprietary concept is
not adequate (because, as you say, some companies do not have any FOSS
activity), it is very much important to differentiate the two concepts
(proprietary and commercial) when it makes sense. I think it makes sense
when we talk about mono, doesn't it ?
