<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Was wondering if anybody could tell me of any instances where 
</I>&gt;<i> proprietary software has been developed using Mono?  I'm trying to sell 
</I>&gt;<i> some of my bosses at work about the merits of Mono, but one is worried 
</I>&gt;<i> about the &quot;viral&quot; nature of free software.  I'm fairly certain that as 
</I>&gt;<i> Mono's class libraries are released under MIT's X11 license, there 
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't be any problems developing and selling proprietary code on 
</I>&gt;<i> top of Mono, but a few case examples might be good to set my boss' mind 
</I>&gt;<i> at ease.  Thanks alot.

The FAQ explicitly states that you can write commercial programs with
Mono, here are some programs that I remember that are commercial and
using Mono:

	The Virtuoso 3.0 server uses Mono commercially.

	SourceGear's Vault is a commercial .NET program that runs on
	Mono.

	We demoed a cute game at Brainshare which is also commercial.

	One of the Mono Success Stories posted on Novell is about 
	Voelcker Informatik using it for their commercial software. 

And we can get this in writing for your boss if you need.

Miguel.

</PRE>
