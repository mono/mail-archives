As mentioned in my previous emails, Gtk# 1.9.3 (the beta of 2.0) is
available from the new FC yum repo. Once you get that, you will need to
get gecko-sharp and gtkhtmlsourceview-sharp (I am working on packaging
these as well) and then install md from tarballs.

For gecko-sharp, you'll want to use SVN -- when I tried to package it,
there was a build error vs 1.9.3. We'll repackage and rerelease soon.

I think it is unlikely the new MD would be included with the installer.
Gtk# 2 requires GTK &gt; 2.4 (and will soon be &gt; 2.6). That conflicts with
the goal of portability for the installer.
