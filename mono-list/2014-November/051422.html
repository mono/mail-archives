<PRE>&gt;<i> Most of the discussion about it has been around 2012, though I see
</I>there have been some recent check-in on Git, so maybe.  I had the same
question with the ETO project.

I've been recently playing with the Eto project recently, and I'd give it
about 8 pts over 10.

&gt;<i> These seem like one off efforts, and I was
</I>something that was actually being baked into mono and actually maintained.

That would be definitely great. For example, Qt has some bindings, but...
nothing official, an effort (laudable effort) of a single person, I think.

&gt;<i> (not like Windows.Forms has been).
</I>Oh, yes.

I actually wonder why it is so difficult. I mean, WinForms is drawn over
System.Drawing. Even if System.Drawing is based on X11... &#191;would it be so
difficult to change it to whatever else?

I don't know. Sometimes I think about suggesting C# bindings for Fltk. It
would be ugly, but I guess at least it would exist (it is a very simple
toolkit). Or maybe Fltk has something like System.Drawing to draw over it.
