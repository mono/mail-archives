Of course you can use it for free, since the whole mono class
library is MIT-licensed. That's the only licence you're bound
to.

It's really useless to talk about patents. It's even unclear
whether MSFT owns (or has licenced from the respective owners)
all patents for the BCL.

It's unclear if, for example /me doesn't own a patent
on Object.GetHashCode() because I've used it in the very
late 60s to compute a way out of my mother's body.
A prenatal half-cognitive prior act.

On the FAQ: which country shell the FAQ be written for?
USA? EU? India? For all countries? That's not what I
expect from the Mono team or their layers. I expect (1) a good
and free BCL. Everything beyond that is &quot;real world&quot;: you
can get issued by everybody for everything.

Your expectations are too high: you want a &quot;sleep awell&quot;
license from the team.
