<PRE>We do our best to make the installation of mono easy.  We support a wide
number of distros and I'm afraid that some distros are better supported
than others.  Mainly because some older distros don't provide certain
rpms.

I have plans to post rpms that mono requires that don't come with the
distro.  It's in the works.

They will be posted on the website and I'll also create another
red-carpet channel to handle some rpms deps.  This should solve the
problems discussed here.

Sorry you've run into troubles.  Using the linux installer is a great
suggestion.  But, we're working on it fixing the rpm deps problems.

Wade

P.S.  The I/O timeouts are due to a bug in red-carpet, not the servers
being down or unavailable.  If you retry the command again it will
continue downloading.

&gt;<i> OK, here is my feedback to the Mono team regarding my installation 
</I>&gt;<i> experiences.  I hope it doesn't sound too complaining or preachy.  The 
</I>&gt;<i> bottom line is I hope the Mono team will really improve the 
</I>&gt;<i> installation instructions.  I think it is going to be important to the 
</I>&gt;<i> adoption of Mono for people to be able to get it up and running, 
</I>&gt;<i> regardless of their distro or, for example, which freakin' version of 
</I>&gt;<i> glibc they have installed.  Ultimately I'd like to see Mono be more 
</I>&gt;<i> configuration tolerant and install all the necessary dependencies its 
</I>&gt;<i> needs.  At the very least, the instructions should be much more helpful 
</I>&gt;<i> than they are about exactly what the dependencies are, and where to get 
</I>&gt;<i> them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Mono web site is terribly unhelpful, misleading, and just plain 
</I>&gt;<i> wrong about stuff it tells you.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let's take this example here.  The very first sentence of the RedHat 9 
</I>&gt;<i> installation page says &quot;The best way to install Mono on your system is 
</I>&gt;<i> to use Novell's Red Carpet.  If you do not already have Red Carpet, you 
</I>&gt;<i> can download it.&quot;  The link to download Red Carpet is not helpful at 
</I>&gt;<i> all.  It doesn't tell you which files you need, or what order you need 
</I>&gt;<i> to install them.  My experience has been that installing Red Carpet was 
</I>&gt;<i> just as difficult as installing Mono without Red Carpet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But I wonder if your opinion of not using Red Carpet is the majority 
</I>&gt;<i> opinion on this site.  If it is the majority opinion, then why does the 
</I>&gt;<i> Mono web site continue to recommend using Red Carpet?  And once you 
</I>&gt;<i> install Red Carpet, it still doesn't work, because it doesn't give you 
</I>&gt;<i> the perl-XML-* stuff that gtk-sharp-gapi needs, and doesn't tell you 
</I>&gt;<i> where to get it from.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now you say that compiling from source is better, because that removes 
</I>&gt;<i> the dependency issues.  That has not been my experience at all.  I have 
</I>&gt;<i> tried to compile from source, and I still have dependency problems 
</I>&gt;<i> (this is especially true for me when I try to compile MonoDevelop, 
</I>&gt;<i> which is a different mailing list, I know).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Speaking of MonoDevelop, their web site suffers from similar 
</I>&gt;<i> inaccuracies.  They say *not* to compile from source unless you 
</I>&gt;<i> absolutely have to, and even go on to say that the Mono project web 
</I>&gt;<i> site contains pre-built binaries!!! Hah.  If that's true, I sure 
</I>&gt;<i> haven't found them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do think Mono has a lot of potential to become a mainstream 
</I>&gt;<i> cross-platform programming platform.  I know a lot of people on this 
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list are doing a lot of really good, hard work.  I just hate to 
</I>&gt;<i> see that effort wasted by poor and inaccurate setup instructions.
