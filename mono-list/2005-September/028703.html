<PRE>Hi,

I am new to Momo. I like it a lot and I'd like to use it.

That said I read there are some issues regarding the ECMA standards as being
available in a &quot;RAND + Royalty Free&quot;.
To be more specific, I read this guy's oppinion:
<A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/~seth/blog/mono">http://www.gnome.org/~seth/blog/mono</A>

I don't know what to think. I am not a lawyer, but that was not the first
time I heard about how this issue can screw OSS.
I am sure the issue was talked alot since 2004.
But I haven't found any documents, or replies from Miguel or Novell, that
can infirm this.

I once heard in mid 2004 that Novell was doing a &quot;legal review&quot;, but I
haven't found any results or replies from them.
I also read the FAQ at www.go-mono.org &lt;<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.org">http://www.go-mono.org</A>&gt;. But they
are only talking about software patents and the 2 ECMA
and non-ECMA stacks. I want to know if &quot;RAND + Royalty Free&quot; can affect me
or OSS in general.

I don't want to uppset anyone, I just want to know of any news or documents
that can give me some peace of mind.
Maybe my google searching skills are bad, and that's why I am asking you.

BTW: Nice work with Mono. I really enjoy it.

Thank you in advance,
