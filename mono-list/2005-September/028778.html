<PRE>    One thing I don't understand is where the heck all this hostility
comes from. He could have started a simple argument/discussion about the
legal implications of the M$/Mono relationship. Instead he decided to
basically flame the Mono devs and users using some over-the-top language
trying to imply the everybody is trying to destroy the &quot;Purity&quot; of
Linux. Seems to me like a person the would say that Linux should have
remained without a Graphical Interface because it spoils the purity of
the OS or smt. 

    It's true patents mean jack-shit nowadays in the EU, but nobody
knows what will happen next. We all hope that even after we join the EU
(hopefully sooner rather than later) things will stay the same in this
respect, but companies are lobbying for the introduction of software
patents and maybe at some point they'll control enough &quot;corrupt
politicians&quot; to have their way. God help us if and when that happens. 

    Anyway, this discussion seems pointless to me at this point,
especially since the introduction was a total fiasco, so I think it
shouldn't move beyond this point. I don't exactly know what the policy
for this list is regarding profanity, so I refrain from telling him a
thing or two in his native language (frankly, a language that is much
better for swearing that english ever was) and will leave it at that.

Keep up the good work.
