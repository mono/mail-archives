The Mono JIT has been ported to the ARM processor, which is different
from porting it to Pocket PC, which is an operating system. The Mono aRM
port runs on Linux: someone with the hw and the sw could likely port to
PocketPC in a few hours (at least the basic stuff).

The Mono runtime is designed to be a full-featured runtime and virtual
machine: full-featured doesn't match well with Palm OS which is a very
restrictive environment. It would require a lot of work to remove
features from Mono to make it work on Palm OS: feel free to start:-)
As a data point, people tried to port another free sw CLI runtime to
Palm some time ago which has half of the features of Mono and still
couldn't make it run (maybe even compile) on Palm OS. Palm OS requires a 
VM specifically designed for very constrained systems.
The Mono runtime can be configured and changed to requires less
resources than it currently does: for Mono without the operating system
this currently amounts to about:
	3-3.5 MB of disk space
	1 MB of RAM (for some sort of semi-interesting small app)
Without lots of efforts this can be reduced to:
	2-2.5 MB of disk
	500 KB of RAM
so we're looking at target devices which have at least 8 MB of
disk/flash space and 16 MB of RAM. Anything below those specs are not
the target of Mono (but since Mono is free software, feel free to change
it to suit your needs).
