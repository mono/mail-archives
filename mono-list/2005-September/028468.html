<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> But what is the status of this subproject? when (possibly) the .net 1.1 
</I>&gt;<i> will
</I>&gt;<i> be fully functional under Mono?
</I>
The WinForms effort is going well but is far from complete - the
RoadMap estimates some time next year for completion I think...
---
ok, good to know


&gt;<i> is it possible to launch install  .Net Framework 1.1 under wine + mono,
</I>&gt;<i> (I've heard it requires to add several dlls from the native windows). will
</I>&gt;<i> the .Net app work afterwards, or no?
</I>
Maybe you are a bit confused over what Mono is? Mono is a
cross-platform runtime for the .NET Framework. Therefore you do not
&quot;install .Net Framework 1.1&quot; on any system, you would use Mono
instead. In this case, Mono replaces the .Net Framework 1.1, and it
does not require wine in any way (I think!)
---

you're right, it's just that wine works this way - it implement some 
libraries, and the ones that aren't complete can be substituted with 
original dll's I was hoping the similiar would be possible for Mono. Also 
the wine doesn't allow (as of yet) to execute the .NET written applications 
(that's what fro mono is) I was hoping that combining this packages would 
allow that.

Still, if the WinForms are going to be released next year, then it is no 
problem for me. I'll finish my app under .Net Framework and next year try to 
rewrite it under Mono.

btw. what is the status of following the .Net 2.0 ?

Hope that helped a little...

Thx
