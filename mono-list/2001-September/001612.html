<PRE>&gt;<i> CLS?
</I>
Sorry, meant CTS (Common Type System).

&gt;<i> The problem as I see it is categories have to be implemented in the
</I>&gt;<i> runtime library which handles all objects in general so that when
</I>&gt;<i> another object (possibly written in Java or whatever) calls said
</I>&gt;<i> method, the new stacked method is called, not the original. So
</I>&gt;<i> unless the general runtime supports class extensions, I don't see
</I>&gt;<i> how it would work like it's intended.
</I>
You do not need to have categories supported by the runtime system.
You just need the message sending routine to know about it.

What this means is that you can consume CTS types, but you would not
be able to expose &quot;augmented&quot; types back to other components.

CTS compliance has various levels, what I said is that my suggested
plan would allow you to become a CTS consumer, but maybe not a
provider, or not a provider in all cases.

Miguel.
