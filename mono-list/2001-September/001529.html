Hiyas,

Also remember that what is patent infringement in the US isn't =
necessarily so in other parts of the world.... places like the EU have =
gotten tired of US application of patents for software and have =
basically decided to go it alone (I believe the situation now is only =
truly ground breaking software algorithms can be patented), and places =
like China among others for all practical purposes really don't don't =
care.

So, if MS wishes to persue restrictive US patent suits, then they'll be =
in the US primarily, and they'll have to prove who wrote the code as one =
can simply claim it was written in Europe where (one would hope) it =
didn't infringe any patents.

Now the more inteteresting situation is the legal status of one in the =
US who is using free software &quot;written legally in the EU&quot;, distributed =
on the Net, and used by that individual in the US.

I'd be interested to have comments from anybody with an actual legal =
background of this and a para-US perspective as this is only my =
understanding of the current ball game, and may well be wide of the =
mark.

And what's the legal status of somebody in the US using (rather than =
writing) US patent infringing software?

Cultural imperialism is empowered by people buying into its =
assumptions.... is there perhaps the assumption of applicability of US =
law?

Quite probably a dead-end, but worth I think challenging the assumption, =
as much of the corporate might in the US is based upon this assumption.

Cheers
    Guy.

  i personally do believe that it is pure intimidation.
  what could they legally do against one's other program ?
  the fact is that its program as same interface but it is not the first =
time one write a library with same interface as other, no ?
