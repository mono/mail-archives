</I>&gt;<i> Please explain how the mono project does not fall under the catagory

Please don't FUD (or encourage it in others, such as Microsoft).

&quot;Troublesome&quot; of any sort should only be applied when the trouble has
been specifically identified.  If someone knows particular patent
claims that Microsoft has on aspects of Mono's (current or planned)
implementation of .NET, or particular copyright issues, then they can
be considered and avoided.

The thing that I think Miguel didn't mention is the concept of
&quot;derivative work.&quot;  I doubt there is a legally precise definition of a
derivative work, but I will guarantee you that if you algorithmically
transform one thing (Microsoft .NET DLLs or XML files) into something
else (C# skeleton files), the something else will be considered a
derivative work.  In that case, use and distribution of the derivative
work must be compatible with the copyright and license you (where
&quot;you&quot; is the creator of the derivative work) obtained from the
original work's owner (Microsoft).

A traditional part of software licenses is that the user cannot create
derivative works.  While Microsoft may overlook minor infringements of
this, they probably will *not* overlook anything that competes with
them or might erode their market share (such as Mono).

(Note: I'm also a hacker, not a lawyer.)
