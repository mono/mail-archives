</I>&gt;<i> Another option is of course to stick with gettext (&quot;....&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It's probably my windows-centric background but I find it hard to see what
the problem is with gettext (&quot;....&quot;); ...certainly I don't see a problem
with the verbosity of this operation that I don't see to a greater degree
elsewhere.

One could equally address the verbosity of the StringBuilder class or a
dozen other cases.

Such is the nature of class frameworks that attempt to be semantically
transparent (by degree of course). Remebering that C# along with being aimed
at core development is also aimed at RAD and &quot;light-weight&quot; developers (like
me =). When remembering this the need for clarity can be seen as an imprtant
goal.

MS now has a reasonable degree of experience in producing RAD frameworks
from VB... now I hate VB, and the next chap may think Delphi is far
superior, but I think that the .NET class framework show's considerable
thought and effort toward a consistent, clear framework.... we should maybe
try and stay inline with the ethos of the framework.

Cheers
    Guy.
