<PRE>Hi All,

Below is a clarification on using OCL (<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ocl">http://sourceforge.net/projects/ocl</A>)
within your work.  BTW, the Platform Abstraction Layer (could be used as a
C# wrapper around your C wrapper for OS/VES interaction) is not part of the
standard, so use of that is not related to the ECMA copyright.

Hope this is useful.

Scott

Hi All,

Last week there was much discussion on other open source project mailing
lists regarding the copyright issues of re-using OCL within those projects,
because the OCL source baseline was generated directly from the draft ECMA
specification.  We have confirmed with Jan van den Beld, ECMA Secretary
General, the copyright issues pertaining to the standard itself:

&quot;With respect to the ECMA Standard the situation is, and has never been
changed, that the contents are available free of charge and freely copyable.
Since ECMA is the owner of the ECMA Standard it is unavoidable that ECMA has
copyright on it, but ECMA has never made any claims with respect to this
right. However, we want to retain the copyright, e.g. for the case that
somebody would take the ECMA Standard, change it and still call it an ECMA
Standard: in such a situation ECMA would apply, if needed, legal means to
undo, or otherwise correct the situation.&quot;

Mr. van den Beld's statement only applies to the standard, not to specific
implementations (e.g. OCL), but as you know OCL has been released under the
Intel Open Source License - a fairly non-restrictive BSD style license.

We hope others can re-using OCL, gaining the following benefits:
- Ensures CLI implementations match, as close as possible, the class
libraries defined in the draft ECMA CLI standard.
- Provides implementations (some partial) of ~90 of the ECMA standardized
classes
- Eliminates the need to manually code class, interface, enum, property,
method, etc. signatures for over 300 standardized classes
- In-line source documentation that matches the wording in the draft ECMA
standard.

If you have further copyright or related questions, please contact Mr. van
den Beld at: <A HREF="mailto:jan@ecma.ch">jan@ecma.ch</A>

Regards,
Scott
