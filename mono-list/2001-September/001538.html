<PRE>&gt;<i> &lt;vbg&gt; Did I make you think that I was experienced?  That was a
</I>&gt;<i> big mistake!
</I>&gt;<i> I am new also.
</I>OK, we are in same boat then (-:

&gt;<i> I just ran autogen.sh.  I didn't run the others manually, although I think
</I>&gt;<i> autogen.sh does it for you (just guessing here from the output I remember
</I>&gt;<i> seeing).
</I>I tried just to run autogen.sh but with no luck. The configure file could
not be found and I don't think autogen.sh creates it for you. From what I
can tell from the script it only checks dependencies (autoconf, glib etc.)
and then executes configure. That was why I ran libtoolize, autoconf, etc.
manually but it is my first time using these tools so I might have missed
something.

Concerning glib I build it with no thread support.

Are you using the latest version of Cygwin? I'm not so maybe that is my
problem? I use the Cygwin version from April. Latest version is from May.

&gt;<i> I'll let you know what I find.
</I>Thanks, looking forward to it.

Mads
