CLS?

The problem as I see it is categories have to be implemented in the runtime library which handles all objects in general so that when another object (possibly written in Java or whatever) calls said method, the new stacked method is called, not the original. So unless the general runtime supports class extensions, I don't see how it would work like it's intended.
