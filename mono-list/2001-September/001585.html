<PRE>Thanks Everyone,

I've gotten positive responses from a few people about this.  I am just
reading up on a few suggestions, and I will be in touch with people as I
make up a sort of roadmap.

It will take awhile, as I have just started a new contract and have to
prioritize, but hopefully I will have a rough outline pointing out &quot;what you
need to know&quot; (&quot;you&quot; meaning anyone who wants to work on or understand Mono
internals) in a few days.  I am not a technical writer, so don't expect
anything fancy. ;)

I do have two questions for Miguel:

1 - what was the first thing you did when you started Mono? (ie.  did you
read certain documention, try MS .NET Framework, etc...?)
2 - what were the first things you coded for Mono in general, and in
particular for the compiler?

Regards,

Richard A. Hein

Being myself part-Wannabe part-CrazyDog I may not qualify to be your mentor,
but as I am the one who is trying to make the Mono compiler at least
bilingual, if you wan't to dialogue with me, I'm all ears (let's say eyes).

</I>&gt;<i>Sorry for the offtopic post, but I was wondering if there are any other
</I>&gt;<i>wannabees (<A HREF="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/wannabee.html">http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/wannabee.html</A>) on
</I>&gt;<i>this list that would like to study and share insight and knowledge of the
</I>&gt;<i>Mono project?  I particular, people who are probably from a Windows
</I>&gt;<i>background, new to Linux/Unix and would like someone to study with?  Or if
</I>&gt;<i>you are new to Windows, I suppose it would work the other way as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I was looking at the code tonight, and I really would love to understand
</I>&gt;<i>what is this code is doing, but I find it *very* complex.  I would
</I>&gt;<i>especially like to understand how the compiler works.  Perhaps someone to
</I>&gt;<i>share the burden with would make things easier.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Also, if there is anyone who would like to act as a mentor, please let me
</I>&gt;<i>know.  Perhaps we can use the discussions to make up some documentation to
</I>&gt;<i>help other cluebies get a grip on the complexity of this project (like
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;Understanding Mono for Wannabees&quot;, or something).
