<PRE>Sorry for the offtopic post, but I was wondering if there are any other
wannabees (<A HREF="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/wannabee.html">http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/wannabee.html</A>) on
this list that would like to study and share insight and knowledge of the
Mono project?  I particular, people who are probably from a Windows
background, new to Linux/Unix and would like someone to study with?  Or if
you are new to Windows, I suppose it would work the other way as well.

I was looking at the code tonight, and I really would love to understand
what is this code is doing, but I find it *very* complex.  I would
especially like to understand how the compiler works.  Perhaps someone to
share the burden with would make things easier.

Also, if there is anyone who would like to act as a mentor, please let me
know.  Perhaps we can use the discussions to make up some documentation to
help other cluebies get a grip on the complexity of this project (like
&quot;Understanding Mono for Wannabees&quot;, or something).

Regards,

Richard A. Hein
