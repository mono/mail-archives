<PRE>&gt;<i> If I understand you correct you would prefer that the Mail API for Mono to
</I>&gt;<i> be based on Camel. It makes sense because Ximian already has this mail API
</I>&gt;<i> as a project. But how would you go about it? Make wrapper classes in C# that
</I>&gt;<i> uses Camel or a 100% C# implementation. 
</I>
I would just translate into C# the existing C implementation. 

But a &quot;quick&quot; job could be to just wrap into C# accessor methods.

&gt;<i> Concerning the former how tired is
</I>&gt;<i> Camel to the Gnome environment? 
</I>
It is not tied, it is a standalone C library.

&gt;<i> Concerning a C# implementation how would it
</I>&gt;<i> be suitable to reuse the Camel code. A very close relationship by
</I>&gt;<i> translating C structs to C# structs, or just use method implementations and
</I>&gt;<i> translate to OO in C# (classes and inheritance)? Are there any other
</I>&gt;<i> documentation on Camel other than the source?
</I>
The sources contain in-line API documentation, which should be pretty
self-explanatory.

&gt;<i> Concerning JavaMail. Is it likely that the existing JavaMail code (source or
</I>&gt;<i> bytecode) will be able to run on top of the CLI platform? 
</I>
I am not sure about this, but JavaMail lacks various enhancements
that are needed (Jeff can provide more details on the differences)

Miguel.
