<PRE>&gt;<i> I'm very interested in the Mono project and would like to contribute to =
</I>&gt;<i> the class library. I followed the link &quot;Classes Distribution&quot;, but was =
</I>&gt;<i> led to the download page. Then, how should I check which class is not =
</I>&gt;<i> implemented from the downloaded package? I also downloaded the =
</I>&gt;<i> specification draft from the dotexpert, but I still didn't get a clue. =
</I>&gt;<i> So, could you please give me some instructions on how to check which =
</I>&gt;<i> class is not implemented? Any help is greatly appreciated.=20
</I>
Download the sources, if you see a class you want to implement, you
might want to check if someone has &quot;registered&quot; its interest to
implement it.  

Interest is registered at:
	<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/class-status/index.html">http://www.go-mono.com/class-status/index.html</A>

Let us know what you want to work on.

Miguel.
