 &gt; I think that as far as a reflection-based stub generator produces the SAME 
 &gt; information as published in the ECMA documentation, which is public and 
 &gt; MEANT to be used by implementers, it is LICIT to use it. That is because you 
 &gt; are just automating what one would have to do by reading the documentation 
 &gt; and typing appropriate input in the code editor.
 &gt; 
 &gt; The problem is that by using reflection you'll probably find many more 
 &gt; classes/methods than the ones in the ECMA docs, and USING THAT EXTRA 
 &gt; INFORMATION in any way may be qualified as reverse engineering.

My point was that it's not *just* reverse engineering -- which can be
done in a perfectly okay, lega manner -- but, depending on the nature
of the reflection, may actually be more like a derived work.
