<PRE>Miguel,

In case you are not looking at the OCL list, please see Intel's message to
Rhys.  Maybe Mono could work with Intel too?  You would be the best one to
initiate contact, probably.

Hi Rhys,

Apologies for the delayed response, we were at the ECMA meeting last week
before the holiday weekend.

Correct, the 'AllTypes.xml' file was used to generated our baseline code and
all documentation comments contained within.  I don't know the answers to
your copyright/patent questions, but do know anyone implementing the
standard should be given RAND (Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory) licenses
needed to implement the standard.  If you would like more information,
please contact Jan W. van den Beld, ECMA Secretary General.  I'll send the
contact information directly to you.

Is your work continuing in the CLI library space?  I'd like to work with
other CLI implementers to refine the Platform Abstraction Layer, helping to
ensure library and VES implementations can interoperate with minimal porting
effort.

Best Regards,
Scott

I assume you are referring to &quot;AllTypes.xml&quot;.  Is there a public
notice somewhere that explicitly places this XML file into the
public domain, for use by anyone?

The file has obviously been derived from Microsoft code at some
point in the past.  I want to clear up the current Copyright on that
file.  I don't want to incorporate information from that file and
then have Microsoft's lawyers turn up on my doorstep.

As a member of ECMA, Intel is probably within its rights to use
anything generated by ECMA.  But I'm not a member of ECMA,
and so I want to be sure that I can implement and use anything
with the &quot;ECMA stamp of approval&quot; without fear of reprisals.
An explicit notice from ECMA and/or Microsoft is needed to
allay my fears.

On a related note, has Microsoft given an undertaking to ECMA
that it will not pursue patent cases against people who make a
good faith effort to implement the specifications as written, and
who may inadvertently infringe patents that Microsoft holds?

This may actually turn into a big issue.  I discovered patent
#6,167,565 a couple of days ago, owned by Microsoft, which
appears to be a patent on the PInvoke mechanism, or something
very much like it.  Without PInvoke, implementing the C#
system library effectively becomes impossible.

Cheers,

Rhys.
