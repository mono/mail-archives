<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for you reply, Nick.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When you run make where does it think the glib-config is? For
</I>&gt;<i> intance mine
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; says:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; checking for glib-config... /usr/local/bin/glib-config
</I>&gt;<i> Mine say the same.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, I'm not an experienced developer on the Unix platform so I'll tell you
</I>&gt;<i> what I did in details in hope that you will be able to tell me
</I>&gt;<i> where I went
</I>&gt;<i> wrong.
</I>
&lt;vbg&gt; Did I make you think that I was experienced?  That was a big mistake!
I am new also.

&gt;<i> Build libtool 1.4 and install (make check fails in 9 of 84 tests)
</I>&gt;<i> Build glib 1.2-10 and install (make check a success)
</I>
OK, I did the same here.

&gt;<i> In mono dir I do the following:
</I>&gt;<i> libtoolize
</I>&gt;<i> aclocal
</I>&gt;<i> autoconf
</I>&gt;<i> autoheader
</I>&gt;<i> automake -a (can't find ltconfig)
</I>&gt;<i> automake
</I>&gt;<i> autogen.sh
</I>
I just ran autogen.sh.  I didn't run the others manually, although I think
autogen.sh does it for you (just guessing here from the output I remember
seeing).

&gt;<i> make
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
For me the make completed without errors, but had warnings (see the other
thread).  That is, until they added monoburg.  That's a whole new kettle of
fish.  I'm pressing on to find out how to fix the build on cygwin for that
one as I type.  I'll let you know what I find.

&gt;<i> Make starts out trying to compile monoburg.c which fails on my machine
</I>&gt;<i> because it cannot find glib.h and glibconfig.h. I copy these files into
</I>&gt;<i> directories gcc knows (e.g. /usr/local/include). Running make
</I>&gt;<i> again results
</I>&gt;<i> in the error I got earlier (undefined reference to g_*).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any ideas to what I did wrong?
</I>
Doesn't sound like you did anything wrong.  Can you grep for those g_*
functions?  Where ever they are add to your path and see if that helps.

Later,
Nick D.
