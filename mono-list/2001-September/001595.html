 &gt; I think I've asked this question before some C# experts, and they said no. 

It should be possible to add an Objective C dialect.  Given that ObjC
is a superset of C, there will be obvious restrictions there, but its
object model is similar enough, that support shouldn't be too
difficult.  FWIW, MicroSoft is working with at least one SmallTalk
vendor to make sure that the support they need is in there, so I'd
imagine that whatever changes ObjC may need will be included in the
SmallTalk ones.
