<PRE>[SNIP]

&gt;<i> The original .NET API's for internationalisation will be
</I>&gt;<i> fully supported, and any programmer who wants to expend
</I>&gt;<i> the effort of doing it the long way can do so.  But I believe
</I>&gt;<i> that internally within our own libraries, we should be
</I>&gt;<i> doing something better.
</I>
So, embrace and extend?

So many time when we here people dodging a spec we here &quot;the old spec will
still be supported, what we're offering is just optional&quot;.... it reads no
better when you say it friend.

&gt;<i> I suggest that anyone who thinks that the .NET system
</I>&gt;<i> is OK go off and write 250+ C# classes, complete with
</I>&gt;<i> resources, using Microsoft's API's.  For added pain,
</I>&gt;<i> do it yourself.  One person.  No one else helping you.
</I>
You're right, I'm not doing it and for that reason I can't mandate how it
should be done. As a hopeful user of the final product I can however give
you my opinions on what I will and wont use, and if I find people are using
a convention under Mono that doesn't compile under .NET I'll feel let down
especially over reducing a verbose term to a new keyword.

&gt;<i> I've done this with pnetlib: it is fully translation-ready,
</I>&gt;<i> and 99.9999% written by me.  And it was a monumental
</I>&gt;<i> pain to pull out all those resources and then write
</I>&gt;<i> 'Environment.GetResourceString(&quot;tag&quot;)' for the 1000'th
</I>&gt;<i> time.  I'd sell my soul for the &quot;_&quot; keyword about now. :-)
</I>
I vote we introduce &quot;PRINT&quot; to replace Console.Write(...) then.

&gt;<i> And that's *after* wrapping up the .NET API's in a way
</I>&gt;<i> similar to Microsoft's method.  Try this on for size:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (new ResourceManager
</I>&gt;<i>     (Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Name,
</I>&gt;<i>      Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()))
</I>&gt;<i>         .GetString(&quot;tag&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's what it would look like with no wrapping at all.
</I>&gt;<i> The .NET API's are not convenient to use.  They are
</I>&gt;<i> building blocks that need to be wrapped to be useful.
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to see them wrapped one way, and not 100's
</I>&gt;<i> of different ways.
</I>
Hmm, as I mentioned before, the library is essentially a Microsoft library.
If you go at it with the intent of turning it into a Unix library then
you're going to wind up with something different... normally that's not a
big deal, it is however when the deal is supposed to be winding up with
something the same as.

It's a value judgement as to whether or not you like the verbose nature of
the library... I happen to like it, as it is explicit and clear, not obscure
and terse.... it is written that way for a reason. There is a product value
in the design of the library, it's not simply &quot;MS suck at this&quot;, it's that
way on purpose. You might want to consider that purpose before you simply
decide it sucks and move off at a tangent.
