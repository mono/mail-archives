<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>So does this mean I can sue anyone who uses reflection on my assemblies? Can
I sue Microsoft for creating &quot;reverse engineering&quot; software that
views/reads/resolves/loads assemblies in memory?
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

Reflection could even be considered a copyright protection circumvention
technology and thus fall under the DMCA. Following this line of thought,
the DMCA has the potential to outlaw Java, all JVMs, C#, and the CLR &lt;vbg&gt;.

IANAL, but it is my understanding, that, when software is shipped to a
customer as a binary, there is an implicit assumption that the internal
workings of the program are not made available to the customer. Reverse-
Engineering for me means to find out about the inner workings, and the
ultimate goal is to get the source code and even design documents.
Disassembling binary code is considered reverse engineering and it
does not even give you higher level information about the binary such
as class names, method names, parameters, etc. So if you can use
reflection in order to find out the class names, interface names,
parameters,
etc. you have even gotten further to the goal of discovering the source
code.
