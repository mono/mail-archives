<PRE>&gt;<i> I was looking at the code tonight, and I really would love to understand
</I>&gt;<i> what is this code is doing, but I find it *very* complex.  I would
</I>&gt;<i> especially like to understand how the compiler works.  Perhaps someone to
</I>&gt;<i> share the burden with would make things easier.
</I>
It might be useful to have some background information on compilers.
Just the basics: scanning and parsing.  

The Mono compiler differs from other compilers in that it uses classes
to represent constructs that it parses.  Look in the yacc parser for
constructs like this:

	$$ = new If (...);
	$$ = new While (...);
	$$ = new Class (...);

You might want to look at the mcs/mcs/compiler.doc that explains the
general organization of the compiler as it stands right now.

&gt;<i> Also, if there is anyone who would like to act as a mentor, please let me
</I>&gt;<i> know.  Perhaps we can use the discussions to make up some documentation to
</I>&gt;<i> help other cluebies get a grip on the complexity of this project (like
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Understanding Mono for Wannabees&quot;, or something).
</I>
Sounds great.  

If you have specific questions, please feel free to ask them on the
forum, I am sure someone will reply.

Miguel.
