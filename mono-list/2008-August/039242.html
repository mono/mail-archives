<PRE>Hi,

as for an alternative to the pyopengl bindings useable from c#, the 
taoframework
is probably the way to go. They have several great bindings to different 
C-APIs. <A HREF="http://www.taoframework.com/project">http://www.taoframework.com/project</A>
There are packages for debian and probably as well for ubuntu. On debian 
they
share the prefix libtaoframework-*.

But as the name &quot;bindings&quot; suggests, Tao.OpenGl for example only 
provides the functionality of opengl which of its own doesn't have any 
easy to use canvas.

There are many Frameworks out there that extend the basic opengl 
functionality
(csgl, clutter, sdl, glfw).
Within the tao-project Tao.Sdl and Tao.Glfw provide the functionality of 
having a window to draw stuff in, processing user input etc. but still 
don't integrate very well with GUI-toolkits. Maybe that's already what 
you were looking for .. (There's also Tao.FreeGlut but that's pretty 
outdated).

If you really need 3d canvas widget functionality this of course depends 
on the GUI-Toolkit you're using.
If you're using gtk# there's <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/GtkGLAreaSharp">http://www.mono-project.com/GtkGLAreaSharp</A> 
though I
don't know much about it, and I'm afraid the installation could be far 
from straightforward.

hope this helps a bit,
 Daniel
