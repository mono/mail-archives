<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Folks, I am in need of some help.  I have been all over the internet
</I>&gt;<i> and these forums looking for some answers, but I am afraid I can't find
</I>&gt;<i> any.  My apologies if this has been covered already and my search skills
</I>just
&gt;<i> stink.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have been asked to pursue a replacement for the front-end of a
</I>&gt;<i> network node information PostGRES database we have running on a *nix
</I>server.
&gt;<i> Currently, the front-end is in an old and hokey version of Zope.  After
</I>&gt;<i> looking around for a replacement CMS, and realizing that I would have
</I>&gt;<i> to do a lot of programming anyways, I decided to just develop it in
</I>&gt;<i> asp.net(vb). The situation is this: my test page works fine on my PC
</I>(connects to
&gt;<i> the DB, gridview shows records, buttons for add/edit/delete work, etc) but
</I>we
&gt;<i> don't have a single windows server on the platform.  So, I want to do a
</I>&gt;<i> proof-of-concept to the powers that be with my existing page on my
</I>&gt;<i> persnal *nix box.  Problem is, I am having nothing but problems porting
</I>the
&gt;<i> application over.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I installed what I believe to be all the necessary packages
</I>&gt;<i> (mod_mono-1.2.1-1, mono-core-1.2.4-2, mono-data-postgresql-1.2.4-2,
</I>&gt;<i> mono-basic-1.9-1, mono-web-1.2.4-2, mono-winforms-1.2.4-2, and
</I>&gt;<i> mono-data-1.2.4-2)
</I>
Your versions are pretty mixed, you'll have a lot let problems if you use
the same version for all components (1.9.1). A lot of VB+aspx issues have
been fixed in mono-core since 1.2.4.

&gt;<i> and made the changes required per a few sites I
</I>&gt;<i> found with some how-to's.  But, still no luck.  I am 99% sure that it is
</I>&gt;<i> because of my ignorance that I am having these issues.  My personal *nix
</I>&gt;<i> machine is running CentOS 5.2, and the development server is running
</I>RHEL4.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, here are my questions to you fine folks:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1.) When I am developing the page, am I better with a &quot;code behind&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> style or &quot;inline&quot; for functionality with mono?
</I>It shouldn't matter.

&gt;<i> 2.) When I copy the page over, do I copy over the entire directory?  Or
</I>&gt;<i> just my aspx and .config files?
</I>You'll need everything you need to run on Windows, if you have other
referenced assemblies or resources for instance you'll need to copy over
those too.

&gt;<i> 3.) Are there any limitations I need to know about in regard to mono
</I>&gt;<i> and asp.net(vb)?
</I>It should be compatible, otherwise it's a bug.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can post code snippets, etc...  whatever is needed to work through
</I>&gt;<i> these issues so that I can harness the power of asp.net(vb) for this
</I>project
&gt;<i> as opposed to something like Drupal or Joomla.
</I>
It would be a lot easier to help if you explained the issues (error
messages, etc) :)

Rolf
