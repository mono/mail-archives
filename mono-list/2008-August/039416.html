Hi everybody,

I startet porting a VB.Net application to Mac OSX without a problem but with
Ubuntu Linux I had some difficulties using binaries AND compiling from
source: Mono seemed to be installed right the way it should, but starting an
VB.Net application, Mono (1.2.6/1.9.1/2.0 preview) complained about not
finding the libraries (eg. Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll). It took quite some
time until I figured out this work-around, perhaps saving some Ubuntu users
from having a hard time:

1. Install the actual Mono framework (1.9.1 in my case) on Ubuntu 8.04 which
you downloaded from the Mono-project site OR use the install procedure
described in (2.)


2. (Only if you don't have a clean install! It's also very comfortable,
installs all essential parts and worked very well for me. Otherwise go to
(4.) ) Under system -&gt; administration -&gt; software sources -&gt; third party
software insert the line

deb <A HREF="http://directhex.mfgames.com/">http://directhex.mfgames.com/</A> hardy main

and download the GPG key from

Ubuntu's Keyserver
(<A HREF="http://keyserver.ubuntu.com:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0x590BCD51DFC2AFC1">http://keyserver.ubuntu.com:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0x590BCD51DFC2AFC1</A>)

which has to be inserted in &#8222;authentification&#8220;. After closing the window
click &quot;reload&quot;. After a short time you will be noticed of new packages
available by the update manager.


3. Install the new Mono packages (in my case 1.9.1, by now 2.0 preview is
already there for download) and all dependant packages.


4. Even though mono is installed, it will not find the libraries (which
should to my knowledge should be included in libmono-microsoft8.0-cil), but
you can do a reinstall and by this getting everything to work as it should:
Go to the Mono-project  download page -&gt; select &quot;RedHat&quot; (yes, even though
we will get it to work on Ubuntu!) -&gt; &#8222;For individual packages, go here&#8220; -&gt;
download the &#8222;mono-basic&#8220; package.


5. Now you can do a conversion of the RedHat installation package to
Debian-Package  by the programm &quot;alien&quot;. Get it by typing

sudo apt-get install alien

in a console. Convert your file by typing

sudo alien mono-basic-1.9-1.novell.noarch.rpm

and install the converted package.


Gratulation! Your VB.Net application now should be ready to run. Try it by
using the console, cd to the applications folder and run it by typing

mono &lt;YourApplication.exe&gt;

Have fun with Mono! :clap:
