<PRE>
Folks, I am in need of some help.  I have been all over the internet and
these forums looking for some answers, but I am afraid I can't find any.  My
apologies if this has been covered already and my search skills just stink.

I have been asked to pursue a replacement for the front-end of a network
node information PostGRES database we have running on a *nix server. 
Currently, the front-end is in an old and hokey version of Zope.  After
looking around for a replacement CMS, and realizing that I would have to do
a lot of programming anyways, I decided to just develop it in asp.net(vb). 
The situation is this: my test page works fine on my PC (connects to the DB,
gridview shows records, buttons for add/edit/delete work, etc) but we don't
have a single windows server on the platform.  So, I want to do a
proof-of-concept to the powers that be with my existing page on my personal
*nix box.  Problem is, I am having nothing but problems porting the
application over.

I installed what I believe to be all the necessary packages
(mod_mono-1.2.1-1, mono-core-1.2.4-2, mono-data-postgresql-1.2.4-2,
mono-basic-1.9-1, mono-web-1.2.4-2, mono-winforms-1.2.4-2, and
mono-data-1.2.4-2) and made the changes required per a few sites I found
with some how-to's.  But, still no luck.  I am 99% sure that it is because
of my ignorance that I am having these issues.  My personal *nix machine is
running CentOS 5.2, and the development server is running RHEL4.

So, here are my questions to you fine folks:

1.) When I am developing the page, am I better with a &quot;code behind&quot; style or
&quot;inline&quot; for functionality with mono?
2.) When I copy the page over, do I copy over the entire directory?  Or just
my aspx and .config files?
3.) Are there any limitations I need to know about in regard to mono and
asp.net(vb)?

I can post code snippets, etc...  whatever is needed to work through these
issues so that I can harness the power of asp.net(vb) for this project as
opposed to something like Drupal or Joomla.

Many many thanks in advance for your help on this!

The Jester
