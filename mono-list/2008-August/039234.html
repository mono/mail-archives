<PRE>
I am new to mono and working on an linux system, having previously written ms
c# on windows. I am writing a small application to generate tool paths for a
simple cnc system I have built (its a hobby). I would like to include a 3d
display of the path so that I can see what the output would be. I have some
knowledge of 3d graphics theory but dont want to start from scratch (cant
see the need). So can someone suggest a good package that I can use, I would
like a 3d canvas widget that I can program against. I have looked around the
net and found it most confusing regarding openGL which I assume is the way
to go. I liked the look of the python opengl library it looked easy to work
with however I do want to stick with c# as it is my preferred language. So
can anyone suggest a c# based opengl framework available on ubuntu 8.04
seemingly as easy to use as the pyopengl one. 

thanks

Alan
