</I>&gt;<i> I will add the patches you said on the previous postto my mono branch and
</I>&gt;<i> will give it a try, if found it's really unstable or troublesome then I will
</I>&gt;<i> use one of my backup plans, add a nginx router which will do the ssl
</I>&gt;<i> decryption or using also nginx connect through FastCGI.
</I>
Oh yeah.  I would expect, if you want to run C# on a web server, it's almost certainly best for you to do some of the ASP stuff, fastcgi, or similar.  In other words, let a real web server be the web server, because they're focused on making web servers stable, secure, and supportable.


&gt;<i> I hope with the Xamarin boom the mono project get more alive as novell left
</I>&gt;<i> it semi abandoned when was sold, the las 3.7 mono version is really a giant
</I>&gt;<i> leap and Miguel and it's team seem to be working really hard (I am also a
</I>&gt;<i> Xamarin customer, got MT and MD).
</I>
Maybe.  But I'm doubtful.  It seems to me that Xamarin is focused only on mobile devices and basically nothing else.  (Even coverage for mono on OSX is very sparse.)


&gt;<i> I'm curious, what do you plan to do to stop using the SslSocket?
</I>
We need to make at least a small research project into that.  I'm guessing it will probably be Bouncy Castle.  Not 100% sure yet.  Perhaps openssl - but since they're really C++ with a crude managed wrapper around it, we might not use openssl for that reason.  Bouncy Castle is at least *meant* to be managed code, but I recently uncovered a kind of major flaw with their SecureRandom, which apparently gets used all over the place, so we'll see.  Like I said, haven't made up our minds yet.
