<PRE>Hi All!

   I'm new to Mono, C#, Gtk#, etc.   Sorry if this is an easy question!   I
searched for a while, but couldn't find an answer.


   I'm using MonoDevelop w/Gtk# on a windows machine to develop a program
named FvmRTD.exe.   I can build, debug, and run on the development machine.
   I used MonoDevelop to create a ZIP package and brought it to a different
Windows machine ( XP SP3 ).   When I try to run the EXE by double-clicking I
get a pop-up window saying:

   &quot;FvmRTD has encountered a problem and needs to close.   We are sorry for
the inconvenience.   If you were in the middle of something,  the
information you were working on might be lost.&quot;

   It also has a &quot;Close&quot; button.

   I figured that no GTK# installed might be a problem.  I was hoping to not
make users install Gtk# separately, so I also copied some of the gtk libs (
referenced by my solution ) into the same directory as the EXE.   Same
problem.

   I then installed Gtk# on the target Windows machine, but I still got the
same error message.


   What am I doing wrong?

   Thanks!

JimE.
