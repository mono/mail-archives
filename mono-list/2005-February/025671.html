I know what it says; I wrote it.  I also know that I have virtually zero
knowledge or experience with mixed 64-bit/32-bit platforms, which
Linux/Amd64 is.  Consequently, my guide is somewhat lacking, if only
because I don't know everything. :-)

I have heard that there are /lib64 directories that are searched for 64-
bit libraries, but that's about it.  Not having an AMD64 platform of my
own, it's hard to test for anything else.

So as an experiment, try writing a C program which uses that library,
and compile/link with the 64-bit GCC (whatever that may be named), and
run your C program.  If this fails, which I suspect it will, you will
know why Mono can't find your library. :-)

Then, you can tell us what it takes to find the library, I can update my
guide, and everyone can be happy. :-)
