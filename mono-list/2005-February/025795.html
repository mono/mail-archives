<PRE>Hello,

    Mono 1.1.4 and 1.0.6 have been released.

    As of this version, Mono 1.1.4 has received more testing and more
scrutiny that Mono 1.0.6, and we strongly recommend that people switch
to the 1.1.4 release.

    We will continue to support 1.0.x for those who can not do a larger
change, but keep in mind that 1.1.4 at this point is stabler, has many
less bugs, faster, better tested and more complete than the 1.0.6
series.

    There are significant changes: make sure you read the release notes
as there are many exiting features in monodoc, xsp, apache support, xml,
relaxng, the C# compiler, the VM and more.

    Detailed release notes:

	<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.0.6/">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.0.6/</A>

		Release notes for 1.0.6, xsp, mod_mono, monodoc

	<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.4">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.4</A>

		Release notes for Mono 1.1.4

    These include the locations for the download source code.  If you
want pre-built packages for Linux, MacOS and Windows, go to:

	<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/downloads/">http://www.mono-project.com/downloads/</A>

    This release got delayed as we added more distributions to the
packaging effort.  We hope that the release wont take as long in the
future. 

    Packages for various x86-64 distributions should be available next
week.

</PRE>
