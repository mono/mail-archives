I suspect that on OS X Gtk# runs only through X windows.  I
prefer my program to integrate with OS X's native display;
that is, with the menu in the toolbar at the top of the
screen, etc.  I wonder if that be possible with Gtk# (or
even with Windows.Forms for that matter).

</I>
If anyone had a simple Windows.Forms &quot;hello world&quot; program
to share, then I should like to try it out with mono-1.1.4
on OS X.  It seems as though starting with Windows.Forms
should be easier than starting with Gtk#, because I should
probably have to install more stuff (like Gtk and Gtk# :^)
for Gtk# support to work.
