Yes.

</I>
There are a few data structures that are allocated using libgc which are not
CLI objects. If you're following the svn commits you may have noticed a few
cleanups have been committed in the last few weeks to reduce the amount
and types of structures that we need to handle that way. Most of
the runtime data structures don't use libgc to do allocations.
We are incrementally changing the code to not use libgc-allocated
structures (or at least to manage them separately).

&gt;<i> 3. Does Mono's gc use the layout information of CLI objects, i.e., is it
</I>&gt;<i> exact at least in the CLI space?
</I>
Yes, with a few exceptions:
*) arrays of value types with both pointers and non-pointers are
currently considered conservatively, IIRC
*) fixed-size objects bigger than 64 words
*) any array or object that belongs in a non-root appdomain and
has reference fields
*) the area used for ThreadStatic vars is not pointer-precise
*) the static fields for a class (unless they are all pointer-free)

Some of these are because of bugs in libgc or because of its conservative
nature (the non-root appdomain objects). We are slowly fixing some of these
issues to enable libgc to more precisely track references and to be
able to switch to a different GC in the future.
To fix some of these issues we also need to have libgc handle
additions to the root set more gracefully (right now it has a fixed
number of entries).

&gt;<i> 4. When running some non-trivial programs using Mono, the heap size can

</I>&gt;<i> dominating factor for this behavior: memory fragmentation due to the
</I>&gt;<i> non-compacting gc or memory leaks due to the inexact gc?
</I>
There are several issues that depend on the specific app (and the version
of mono you used).
There were some leaks and excessive memory retention issues in some
codepaths in the mono runtime: these have been mostly all fixed
in mono svn and 1.1.4 (mostly related to gc handles and multiple
appdomain support and reflection.emit).
I don't think that memory retention caused by the conservative nature
of libgc is a big issue with the current mono (1.1.x or svn), unless
the application allocates very large arrays: arrays larger than
a few hundred KB should be avoided or, if possible, they should
be allocated and reused. If the objects are small, the memory
retention will be present, but it should represent just a fraction
of the whole heap size.
Fragmentation may be an issue, but I haven't investigated how much
effect it has on heap size. My guess is that much of the issue
with increasing heap size is because libgc prefers to increase the
heap instead of being more aggressive at reclaiming memory (this
is easily triggered by storing somewhat big arrays in objects with
finalizers). There is probably some tuning or small fixes that need
to be done in libgc to prevent this from happening.
Another thing to investigate is to ensure it uses mmap to
allocate memory insted of sbrk: on default linux behaviour, the
brk space is much smaller than the mmap space and so having
the heap in the larger space could help, since it would be
less fragmented by malloc calls and malloced pointers should
interfere less with the conservative scanning.

&gt;<i> 5. Does Mono use the incremental mode of the Boehm gc?
</I>
We don't, since it usually causes compatibility issues with
syscalls being interrupted while they write to heap memory.

&gt;<i> 6. Are there any concrete plans to eventually replace the Boehm gc by an
</I>&gt;<i> exact, compacting gc? What are the next steps towards this?
</I>
Yes, we have plans for a generational compacting GC for mono 2.0.
You may have a look at docs/precise-gc in the mono module for
some of the details.
Currently we're doing some changes that allows us to
use a different GC without changing code all over the place,
see the metadata/*gc*.{c,h} files. We're also removing
libgc allocations in the runtime code.

Additionally to the steps defined in the document, we need also to:
*) handle object.GetHashCode() for objects that can be moved
(storing the hash in the synchronization field directly, with a flag,
or in the lock structure when the object is locked)
*) keep track with a bitmap or some other way (run-length encoding)
of the reference positions in objects.
*) define a write barrier macro that can be used in the C runtime
and start using it (the default would just store the pointer)
*) change the jit to emit write barrier calls when needed (we
can have specialized write barriers)
*) investigate the stuff needed to advance a thread to a GC-safe
point (single-stepping, read from unmapped memory etc) and implement it
*) modify the jit to save info about references in stack locations:
this can be done just for locals as a start, so that at least
part of the stack is handled precisely.

All of the above can be done without an actual moving GC implementation
(though testing the code is another thing...).
If you or anyone else wants to take on a task from the list,
let me know, so we don't duplicate work. Help is greatly appreciated,
since there are lots of changes.
Thanks.
