<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> I'm currently running Ubuntu Hoary so that I can use Mono 1.0.5 to work 
</I>&gt;<i> with. I'd like to start playing with Mono 1.1, but I'm getting 
</I>&gt;<i> frustrated by the lack of packages available.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know I could compile from source, but I want to be ale to distribute 
</I>&gt;<i> my applications to a web server running the same version.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, which is the best distro for hacking on and developing with Mono?
</I>
Packages for more distributions will soon be coming, now that we have a
dedicated engineer working on this.

Currently the distribution which is likely going to receive most of our
attention is NLD, SUSE 9.2 and the SLES 9 (all SUSE-based) as this is
what we have to support internally for other Novell products.

But as I said, the situation will improve from where we are today.

Miguel.
