<PRE>I am completely new to Mono.  I'm trying to help someone migrate from a
Microsoft/IIS/.NET system to a Linux/Apache/Mono system.

We have both a Microsoft 2003 Server system and a SuSE Linux system, so we
can run the app in .NET while we (try to) incrementally migrate.  First
step is to plop the same code from .NET into Mono while still connecting
to the MS-SQL server on teh .NET system.

Should be simple enough, I though, just move the code, change the
connection string and &quot;voila!&quot;, but no such luck.

What I am running into and what I'm hoping for advice about, is that
watching the MS-SQL server logging output, it appears that the .NET client
initiates communications differently than the Mono client.

Differences:
.NET is using RPC, Mono is using SQL.
The first query issued by .NET appears to be a connection to the database,
as expected.  The first query issued by Mono is some strange call to a
stored procedure that I cannot find anywhere in the system.

I thought maybe I need ADO.NET installed (not in the mono RPMs), but as I
understand, ADO is a db abstraction layer.  The authors of the app we want
to migrade just used SqlClient wherever.

Anyone have any advice for me?
