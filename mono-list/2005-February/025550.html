Yep, I guess this would be possible however you might have to compile
the xsp.exe using the .NET libraries as the mono
System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase didn't really do anything last time I
checked (it doesn't need to on Unix of course).  

Simply put you should just be able to add amother class derived from
ServiceBase and re-name the Main() in XSP to something else and then
call that from the OnStart() method of your new class.
