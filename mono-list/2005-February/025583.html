<PRE>Oh, I forgot to say that even if your server's internet configuration
would allow thousands of live connections being kept, you will have a
much lower limit set by the number of concurrent worker threads
(defaults for some hundreds and is further limited by memory) to service
your ASP.NET requests...

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The web is a stateless environment you request a page, you  get a page,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; you're done. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It indeed is. But the method described (push) enables it to be. It is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; still necessary to send dummy text to keep the connection alive from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time to time, much like a noop in FTP. But it is possible. An example
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of this is the software that I was using until it became non-free to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do what my software will do. It was called webmessenger, was written
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in PHP and was using javascript push. I belive you can still try the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; non-free (as in GPL) version for free (as in gratis) at jabbix.com.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I would suggest you can make additional requests as needed inside an IFrame
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; so the outer page is not refreshed but the page in the IFrame can carry on a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; dialog back and forth with the server using multiple requests. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is called polling, and is not an efficient method either. I do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; prefer the push method a lot.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Push is a scalability killer. As ASP.NET and JSP are geared towards
</I>&gt;<i> scalability, they don't match well your requirement.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ASP.NET is built upon extensive use of the postback method, what means
</I>&gt;<i> that your previous connection will normally get dropped every time the
</I>&gt;<i> user click or even type something in the page. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Polling is much better supported in ASP.NET/JSP. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you really really want to cripple your web server (it is even worse
</I>&gt;<i> for a server farm, as PUSH connections, will make load balancing
</I>&gt;<i> unattainable), I suggest you to develop an asp.net handler (.ASHX) that
</I>&gt;<i> is free of the postback paradigm, but I would put it's returns on a
</I>&gt;<i> hidden IFRAME anyway, so that you don't have to lose the RAD features of
</I>&gt;<i> the .ASPX pages when designing them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks anyway,
