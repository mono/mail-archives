First of all, I wanted to say thank you for doing Fedora 3 packages. 
Unfortunately there appear to be some snags with the packaging:

1.  The fedora yum repository for 1.1.4 is given as:

<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.3/fedora-3-i386/">http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.3/fedora-3-i386/</A>

I assume this is a typo and is meant to be 1.1.4.

2.  There don't seem to be any yum files in the 1.1.4 FC3 repository.  I 
went looking for a directory called repodata, which should contain the 
new format yum files, but it doesn't seem to be there.

(I now downloaded all the mono RPMs using mono-all.zip, and loaded them 
into my local yum repository.)

3.  I now went to download all the mono 1.0.6 RPMs, as the instructions 
said that I should get xsp and various other things from this release. 
On the mono 1.0.6 download page, there is no link to mono-all.zip, 
although it appears to exist and contain the right files.

4.  Finally I hit the problem that I haven't been able to resolve yet. 
When I tried to install xsp from mono 1.0.6, I got a list of unresolved 
dependencies.  It seems to want me to install mono-core-1.0.6.  This is 
obviously not a solution if I am trying to use mono 1.1.4.  If anyone is 
able to offer any suggestions I would be very grateful.

Please don't take this as criticism, I think Mono is a very exciting 
project, and supporting a wide range of distros cannot be easy.  However 
I'm a bit stuck at the moment. :-(

Pete
