Certainly not the worst idea.  I may have to end up doing that myself. 
I guess I'd just prefer to keep everything in my VS environment for ease 
of development.

Trying this path at the moment.  I found the ByteFX source (for 0.71, I 
couldn't find the source for anything later) and opened it in VS to 
compile.  Of course, it needs SharpZipLib.  So I downloaded the source 
for that, but it didn't seem like a &quot;VS&quot; project.  I was able to open 
the individual code files, but no main project.  My guess it that it was 
written/compiled using *their* IDE (available from the same wite where I 
found the source).

Two things I can try when I get the time (hopefully tonight):
1)  Open the SharpZipLib source in their IDE and see if it distinguishes 
between &quot;Build&quot; and &quot;Rebuild.&quot;
2)  Scour the ByteFX code for references to SharpZipLib, add .cs files 
as necessary so that it's all a single project (and cross my fingers, I 
guess).

I'll let you know how either one turns out.
