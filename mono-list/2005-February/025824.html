<PRE>I've been waiting to play with the winforms in OSX, and finally had my 
chance after downloading the 1.1.4 binary package. It worked not quite 
as expected, but it ran. Just a few quick observations based on
compiling swf-buttons.cs.

Is SWF on OSX supposed to use X, I thought there was Carbon driver, is 
that just not ready for release yet, is there a magic command line
option I missed?

I had to set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to pick up libMonoPosixHelper.0.dylib.

I've compiled the button example code swf-buttons.cs, it runs,
displays the buttons however the font styles are occasionally
wrong, they are not bold or italic etc where they are supposed to be.
Colour wise there's nothing wrong and font size is okay for that button.

Only the buttons up to button17 (TextAlign=TopCentre) are drawn.
button17 is drawn on top of what appears to be the Dock=Bottom
button. The other buttons that should be drawn below button17
are not drawn, unless the form is resized, and that causes other
drawing problems.

Anyway, I wasn't expecting it all to work.

Great work so far I can't wait to see SWF on Carbon.

Dave
