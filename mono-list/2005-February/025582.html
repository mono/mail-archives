Push is a scalability killer. As ASP.NET and JSP are geared towards
scalability, they don't match well your requirement.

ASP.NET is built upon extensive use of the postback method, what means
that your previous connection will normally get dropped every time the
user click or even type something in the page. 

Polling is much better supported in ASP.NET/JSP. 

If you really really want to cripple your web server (it is even worse
for a server farm, as PUSH connections, will make load balancing
unattainable), I suggest you to develop an asp.net handler (.ASHX) that
is free of the postback paradigm, but I would put it's returns on a
hidden IFRAME anyway, so that you don't have to lose the RAD features of
the .ASPX pages when designing them.
