&gt;<i>Hello.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I wrote a graphics application with Qt/OpenGL about four
</I>&gt;<i>years ago, and though I've been doing real-time C coding
</I>&gt;<i>since then, I now feel that I have to scratch the itch to
</I>&gt;<i>write a graphics program again.  So I'm interested in
</I>&gt;<i>cross-platform graphics progamming with mono and csharp.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>In particular, I want to write a cross-platform version of
</I>&gt;<i>minesweeper (one of my favorite toys :^).  I want to be able
</I>&gt;<i>to run the application either on Mac OS X or on GNU/Linux.
</I>&gt;<i>Being able to run it on MS Windows would be nice, but it is
</I>&gt;<i>not essential.  Some questions follow:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Is mono-1.1.4 now up to the task?  If not, will it be soon
</I>&gt;<i>enough that I can start?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If so, what toolkit (Windows.Forms, Gtk#, Cocoa#, etc.) is
</I>&gt;<i>best?  (I don't even know if something written for Cocoa#
</I>&gt;<i>could run on GNU/Linux.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I downloaded the OS X installer for mono-1.1.4 and compiled
</I>&gt;<i>a really simple Windows.Forms application.  Although the
</I>&gt;<i>thing crashed because of an unhandled exception, I noticed
</I>&gt;<i>that it opened an X window.  I thought that the new managed
</I>&gt;<i>forms on OS X would render via some more direct path than
</I>&gt;<i>through the X server.  What's up with that?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>GTK# would be best for cross platform, from what I can tell.  I don't 
know about how it runs on OS X, but GTK# apps will ru fine on Windows 
and natively on *NIX.  WinForms support isn't quite up to par yet in 
mono, but it's already semi-usable, and I expect Mono developers to 
start switching over to WinForms (Those that need it anyway) within the 
next few months.
         Cheerio,
             SigmaX
