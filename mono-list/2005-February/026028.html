<PRE>Hello.

I wrote a graphics application with Qt/OpenGL about four
years ago, and though I've been doing real-time C coding
since then, I now feel that I have to scratch the itch to
write a graphics program again.  So I'm interested in
cross-platform graphics progamming with mono and csharp.

In particular, I want to write a cross-platform version of
minesweeper (one of my favorite toys :^).  I want to be able
to run the application either on Mac OS X or on GNU/Linux.
Being able to run it on MS Windows would be nice, but it is
not essential.  Some questions follow:

Is mono-1.1.4 now up to the task?  If not, will it be soon
enough that I can start?

If so, what toolkit (Windows.Forms, Gtk#, Cocoa#, etc.) is
best?  (I don't even know if something written for Cocoa#
could run on GNU/Linux.)

I downloaded the OS X installer for mono-1.1.4 and compiled
a really simple Windows.Forms application.  Although the
thing crashed because of an unhandled exception, I noticed
that it opened an X window.  I thought that the new managed
forms on OS X would render via some more direct path than
through the X server.  What's up with that?
