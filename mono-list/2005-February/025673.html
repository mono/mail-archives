The question becomes whether or not your programs are 32-bit or 64-bit
programs, and ditto for your library.

Running &quot;file&quot; and &quot;ldd&quot; on your programs and your libraries would help.
It would also be good to run them on &quot;mono&quot;, to see if it's actually
using a 32-bit or 64-bit environment.

It might also be good to see if this helps:

	<A HREF="http://gcc.fyxm.net/summit/2003/Porting%20to%2064%20bit.pdf">http://gcc.fyxm.net/summit/2003/Porting%20to%2064%20bit.pdf</A>

It mentions the use of `file`, `ldd`, and how to get GCC to generate
programs for the correct ABI (though 64-bit programs appear to be the
default).

Finally, you should try running mono with MONO_LOG_LEVEL=info and
MONO_lOG_MASK=dll.  That will print out what libraries Mono is trying to
load, and may suggest why Mono can't find your library.
