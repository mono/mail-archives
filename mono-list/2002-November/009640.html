IMHO that has a slight feel of &quot;easy to do&quot; around it ... But don't
be fooled ... People have been discussing interop with Java on dotgnu
list since last September ... JILC came out of such a discussion IIRC.
I'm sad that it has sort of disappeared ....

</I>
Hmm... by that logic writing a CLR JIT should not be that hard ... 
&quot;MS has done it for their .NET runtime&quot; .... How easy is it to fall 
into that trap. MS has had a fast JVM (like) runtime for the past 4 years 
before they started on JUMP and J# ... And they have $$$ and the best
people money can buy... open source just cannot get there that fast.

</I>&gt;<i> if it was sufficient fast.
</I>
Hmmm.... interesting ... I've been following both Mono and Portable.Net
for some time .... Writing a JIT for JVM does not seem to jell with the
Mono idea ? ... Pnet guys seem to have a plugin API for the runtime for
new bytecodes , but they seem to be talking about supporting Parrot ...
and not JVM (a register VM would be tougher right ?)..

</I>&gt;<i> If a developer has some Java or C# source that they wish to use in a
</I>&gt;<i> foreign system long-term, they will want to convert the source code to
</I>&gt;<i> maintain it. Having a binary only converter (1) is not sufficient.
</I>
How about a Java.Net compiler .... I'm hearing rumblings about one 
lately ... But well, I don't think that guy is good enough to deliver
a full Java to .NET compiler anytime soon...

Or a C# -&gt; JVM compiler ? ... IIRC Portable.Net has a nice JVM output
feature .. But I have never been able to run any class files it generates.
t3rminator told me that there's some bug with their assembler or something 
...

Oh, but I forgot you all are talking about Mono/Java interop and not .NET/Java
.... Well hopefully it will work out right..
