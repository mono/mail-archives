<PRE>Hi there!

Just in case anybody forgot, I was wondering if I could get/link the
presentations made at the above conference.

I have gotten two about mono  allready very nice, they are linked in the
GNOME.NET tutorial but it would be realy cool to have the rest too:

================================================================================

#Developer

Implementing a Class Browser and Code Completion (which will be 
about the internal parser and its use)

Implementing Extensible Editors (dealing with the editor control we 
did)

both will be held by Christoph Wille.

================================================================================

The Mono C# Compiler: Design and Implementation of a CIL Compiler 
(Miguel de Icaza)

This talk will discuss the architecture of the Mono C# compiler. 
The Mono C# compiler is the first non-Microsoft implementation of the C#
language specification, and it is written in C# itself. 
The compiler has been self-hosting since January 2002. 
The talk will discuss the issues encountered, as well as future
directions 
for CIL-based compiler optimizations.

================================================================================

Gtk# - Automated Library Binding Using Perl, XML, and C# (Mike Kestner)

This talk will discuss the techniques utilized to provide a C# language
binding 
to the Gtk+ graphical toolkit library via P/Invoke.

    * API extraction from bound library to XML using Perl.
    * C# code generation using System.Xml.
    * Mapping of GObject properties and signals onto C#.
    * Using delegates to callback from C code to C#.


================================================================================

Keynote: Miguel de Icaza:
?Behind the Open Source Implementation of the .NET Framework?

In this talk we will discuss the motivations behind launching a project
to 
implement an open source version of the .NET framework as well as the 
development process that has brought us Mono.

================================================================================

Writing Portable GUI Applications for Win32 and UNIX Using Gtk# (Mike
Kestner)

Gtk+ is a graphical toolkit with backends available for X11 and Win32.
Gtk#
is a set of managed classes wrapping the library which will be used by
the
Mono project to implement System.Windows.Forms. This talk will address
direct use of the Gtk toolkit programming model as an alternative to
System.Windows.Forms. Focus will be on areas such as layout in which it
differs from the System.Windows.Forms API.

    * UTF8 strings and pango font rendering
    * Containers and widget layout
    * Portability to non-Unix systems
