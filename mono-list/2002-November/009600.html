Well, I haven't used the new compiler, I've just read the presentation
slides.  I would imagine that it would generate the same IL.

Is it a revolutionary change?  No.  Does it need to be?  No.  I find it
to be an evolutionary change, and with some of the code I've seen and
tasks I can imagine doing (such as automated class generation for parts
of a class), it's a highly desirable evolutionary change.  I wish Java
had this 4 years ago.

&gt;<i> &gt; The one thing I dislike about this approach is that they added a new

</I>
I was thinking it would be a &quot;pseudo-attribute&quot;, not a real attribute. 
Something that the compiler understands and would recognize during
syntax and semantic analysis, NOT something that would actually appear
in IL.
 
&gt;<i> AFAIK, the new keyword approach is much cleaner for compiler implementation.
</I>
Not having written a compiler yet, I can't comment.  (Though writing a
compiler should happen next semester, if that Compiler class is actually
offered...)
