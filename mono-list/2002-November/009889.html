I don't think the licensing part is really an issue, I think the issue
is that Ximian cannot dictate a non-compete arrangement to a
non-employee who is an open source contributor.  They do not 'own' the
entire project in its entirety.  They have no right to tell a
contributor they cannot be involved because they contribute to another
project.

This is one reason why I have stuck to just lurking and observing, and
have not yet made up my mind what project I want to contribute to.

...just my 2 cents.

Two projects I can think of that have this arrangement are Cygwin and
Ghostscript.  Both are stellar Open Source projects.

The existence of an alternative closed source licensing arrangements is
not a problem as long as the open source version is active and up to
date.

I would start to worry if the free version of the project show signs of
abandonment.  But then again, a truly useful and intrinsically
sustainable open source project will live on even after the original
contributers leave the project.

Ximian licensing their portion of the Mono code with a different license
doesn't worry me a bit.
