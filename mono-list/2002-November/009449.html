<PRE>Actually, even Linux programmers could use an introduction to GTK. Each
time I tried gtk, I was missing the C++ syntax of Qt too much and went
back to Qt. Perhaps, I'm lazy, stupid (or both), but it seems I was able
to pickup Qt pretty much by just following their little samples. It
builds a tank game steps by steps, each step introducing a new concept
until you get a full game at the end.

I was programming my own 3D editor afterwards with little or no
problems. With Gtk, perhaps I didn't spend as much time with tutorials
or whatever but it always seemed awkward. Although, the applications in
Gtk look better and I do want to use it for my programs. I'm hoping Gtk#
will be as intuitive as Qt was for me. Please note, that this was a long
time ago (5 years?). I'm sure the documentation for gnome as improved
since (although a year ago, it still didn't have the intuitive tutorial
of Qt).

Anyway, ranting = off :)

Hello!

This sounds very exciting. IMO, it should be written on such a level,
that
programmers swiching to Linux/Gnome from Windows, will have a good
start.
Most likely
experienced Linux hackers, will have used gtk+, and won't need such an
introduction to Linux programming.

Gtk+, glade, gstreamer, gconf, all together are often needed to build
powerful applications, or at least make development faster or the
application more exciting.
The bad thing was, you had to go through different sources to learn
about
all these technologies.

Gtk# promises to bring all these pieces more thogether, and a tutorial,
taking a new-to-linux programmer by the hand and showing him how to use
it
all, is very much needed. It's a great chance to bring developers to
Linux,
just like mono in general is the most promising development tool in that
concern.

I'm very interested to help.

Hi there!
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had this crazy idea of a Gnome.NET tutorial, which could be a nice
</I>&gt;<i> starting point for programmers whishing to get to understand and or
</I>&gt;<i> develop with mono &amp; gtk#.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> here: <A HREF="http://mwh.sysrq.dk/the_mono_tutorial/">http://mwh.sysrq.dk/the_mono_tutorial/</A> is a beginning,
</I>containing
&gt;<i> very much nothing ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My idea is to give an aplications programmer a nice overview and
</I>samples
&gt;<i> of code to get started. That is to be broad and not go into too much
</I>&gt;<i> detail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now I hope to get some feedback from you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Is this a good or bad idea?
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Which content do you think should be covered in the tutorial?
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Is this allready being done?
</I>&gt;<i> 4. If you want to do this too please contact me.
