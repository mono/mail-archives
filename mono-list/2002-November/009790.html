<PRE>hello,

&gt;<i> Would implementing this assembly require deep knowledge of Windows
</I>&gt;<i> Services?  Also, would it be a good &quot;first C# project&quot; or would it be
</I>&gt;<i> better for someone with more experience with C# and Mono?
</I>
I believe that implementing this will require two implementations: one
for Windows, and one for Unix.  The Windows implementation will probably
have to p/invoke into various Windows apis, so familiarity with this is
important, as you would have to design the Linux version to match the
Windows version behavior-wise. 

&gt;<i> I'm also interested in the POSIX wrapper dll.  Would that require a copy
</I>&gt;<i> of the POSIX standards, or just a working knowledge of the APIs and
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps a Stevens book or two?  Again, how feasible would it be for an
</I>&gt;<i> experienced programmer who has not yet taken on a C# project?
</I>
There are various sites online with the POSIX APIs.

It should be easily doable for a new programmer, but you must be ready
to rewrite a few chunks based on the input that you will very likely
receive ;-)

Miguel.
