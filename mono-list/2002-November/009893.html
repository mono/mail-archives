<PRE>I agree with you, Pokey, and I would expect the hackers list to be used
for technical discussion and filtering out the non-technical off topic
stuff, but I do not agree that it makes sense to force a contributor
into a non-compete agreement type of situation.  To me that goes against
the open source spirit of community collaboration.

I do think there should be some clarification posted and I suspect that
will happen in the near future.
DotGNU/Mono/whoever-else-decides-to-make-an-open-source-CLR/framework
should co-exist as 'friends', a KDE/GNOME type situation would be most
unfortunate.

I'm sure all will come to light and the world will be well again :-)

Well anyway, I've got a ton of Gtk+ and GNOME documentation to pore over
and leaves to rake...

Happy Coding! :-)

PS Did I just write an email to a penguin?  Next thing I know Rupert the
monkey is going to come out of the woods to help me de-leaf my yard! :-P

There are several Open Source/Free Software projects with private
mailing lists and IRC channels including the Linux kernel, the Debian
project and many of the larger GNOME sub-projects. Mono isn't an
exception.

Mostly they're used to discuss 'public relations' with individual users
which would be impolite or encourage rumours if posted on a public list.
The fact that there are several external contributors on these lists
acts as a check that nothing too nefarious will be discussed on them.

There is no conspiracy! :-)
