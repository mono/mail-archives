Yes, there were some bugs that stopped MC++ programs from loading and/or
running under Mono, but they all fixed since then.
One of the bugs was actually an error in the specs, that says that linker version
must be 6.0, but VS.NET and SDK use linker ver. 7 of course.
I think that one necessary thing that is currently not in CVS is Microsoft.VisualC assembly.
However, this assembly is very small - there are only 5-6 classes and they are only used
as modifiers, so have no real bodies just declarations.
