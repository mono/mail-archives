<PRE>Hello!

&gt;<i> Is it possible/desireable to have an integrated IDE (ie SharpDevelop) for linux? What about integrating Glade? capabilities into an IDE so that spoiled/lazy win programers can use this IDE just like VS? Is it possible that SharpDevelop could be the base of a cross-platform IDE that has a &quot;form&quot; editor for Gtk# and mono C# compiler that works on windows and linux, etc?
</I>
Well, Mono directly is not involved in creating an IDE for Linux, but
there are a couple of projects that are:

	SharpDevelop, written in C#, using Windows.Forms.
		It should work once we have Windows.Forms.

	Eclipse, written in Java, uses Swt.
		Its pretty decent, and there is a simple
		C# plugin available.

		Recently Alex started porting it to C#
		using Microsoft's JUMP 

	Anjuta, Gnome product, very mature, but lacks C# support
		Anjuta2 though I believe supports it.

We have a GUI debugger, that we hope to release soon, and you can use
Glade today (we use it for example in the Debugger and in mPhoto to
create and prototype the UIs, in fact there are a couple of tutorials
out there on how to use Glade with Gtk# and Mono). 

Miguel
