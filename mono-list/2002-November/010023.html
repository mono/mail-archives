<PRE>	

	If you are working in System.Windows.Forms, refresh you sources!

	* In visual studio, I added a SWFTest project to the SWF solution.
	* Using Microsoft's swf.dll, I added one of each possible stock
controls to the form.
	* I closed the form (swf design stuff is very incomplete).
	* I Removed the reference to MS's swf.dll, and added a reference to
the SWF project.
	* The result compiles, runs, and can be closed, without crashing in
windows.
	* PrintPreviewDialog is the only item (other than crystal reports)
on the 
	* standard toolbar that is not included.
	* When run, a standard window comes up, not a dialog/form type
window.
	* The form is as small as possible, just a caption bar of minimum
width
	* with control box and min/max box. It can be resized to any size
fine.
	* no controls are actually displayed. they may be of zero size, or
it 
	* may be due to the window not being a dialog box, or it may be
anything.
	
	* Again, I got a &quot;normal&quot; window, not a form type window, and no
controls were displayed.
	* I forgot to bring the test program and solution. I will have to
bring them later.
	* With VS2002 I was able to get Printerpreviewdialog to work, but
maybe not constantly.
	* The project worked after converting to VS2003.
	* The exact methods called at startup varied with minor changes,
such as order items were placed on the form. So your environment may trigger
calls that cause this to fail.

	Plans:
		1) Replace throw notimplmented exceptions with:
			//FIXME:s and calls to base.xxx for overrides.
			//FIXMES:s for void non-overrides.
		2) Start removing &quot;dead code&quot; stubs for inherited code.
		3) Replace the two byte dos end of lines with one byte UNIX
style, while few are working in the namespace.

	* Here is a list of the controls added!

	* ApplicationContext.cs
	* Button.cs
	* CheckBox.cs
	* CheckedListBox.cs
	* ColorDialog.cs
