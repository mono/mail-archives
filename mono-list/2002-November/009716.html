It's not something that depends on a 'deal', but something that depends
on the licenses choosen for the two projects. You can include X11
licensed code in a GPL project, but you can't do the reverse unless the
GPL code is relicensed by the copyright holder. There is nothing 'raw'
about that and it was already discussed on the list, please read the
archives.

&gt;<i> I didn't see any code from mono in .GNU's libraries .... Only one header
</I>&gt;<i> file which was (C) Intel as well...
</I>
That file was largely written by me from some C++ code in the ORP JVM
(though I think only some comments remain from the original work since
at some point I stopped using that code as a guide and used the x86
specification manuals directly). Sergey and Dietmar contributed, too.
