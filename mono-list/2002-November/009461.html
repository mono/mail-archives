<PRE>I've been on this list as a passive bystander for 1+yr?

I'm primarilly a Windows developer (not by choice!) We are beginning to move over to .NET and C# using Visual Studio.NET.

I'm VERY excited about the possibilities of Mono, Gtk#, etc.

May I propose something I know nothing about :)

Is it possible/desireable to have an integrated IDE (ie SharpDevelop) for linux? What about integrating Glade? capabilities into an IDE so that spoiled/lazy win programers can use this IDE just like VS? Is it possible that SharpDevelop could be the base of a cross-platform IDE that has a &quot;form&quot; editor for Gtk# and mono C# compiler that works on windows and linux, etc?

This would be a truely amazing development tool.

Unrelated comment: The idea of a tutorial is outstanding, most of what I know is following the example of others. Is the platform going by the name of Gnome.NET? What about Gnome.Mono... (the &quot;.NET&quot; name is kinda corney anyways)

Keep up the good work guys; You probably don't realize how MUCH you are appriciated. I'd love to help when I get more time...haven't seem my wife and kid for 4 wks :(

Cheers,

Jae Stutzman
