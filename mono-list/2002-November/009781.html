I have a Geode-based set top box at home (233Mhz I think) and had Mono 
running on it at one point. I never did anything really cpu intensive so 
  I can't comment on it's performance.

I'd be happy to run some test applications if any benchmarks exist that 
would give you relevant results. I need to get mono working on it again 
anyway...
