I've been thinking. How about asking for cooperation to IBM or someone
who has implemented the Java libraries already and had been embracing
the Open Source movement, to create a Java compiler for Mono.

There's a lot of software out there written in Java that we could
benefit from if we could compile it on Mono. I don't think it is of much
use to write a Java-to-C# tool, since it would mean to fork all this
software to create our own version. Doing this for every new release of
the software will just mean a lot of work, unless this tool is really
efficient and does this without any problems, of course.

On the other side, I don't know the issues of porting Java to Java.Net.
If someone has some experience, please enlighten me.

Pablo
