<PRE>The &quot;release candidate&quot; of &quot;Thinking in C#&quot; by myself and Bruce Eckel is now available for digital download from <A HREF="http://www.thinkingin.net/ticsharprc1.htm">http://www.thinkingin.net/ticsharprc1.htm</A> The book teaches C#, not Visual Studio, and is command-line oriented; a large majority of the programs have been regularly checked with both mono and Microsoft's csc. (Specifically: two programs do not compile under mono because of what I believe to be a defect in mono's implementation of rectangular array initializers. I've never even bothered to _try_ to run the 56 programs in the Windows Forms and GDI+ chapters, or the 30 programs in the XML and Web Services cahpters. Other than that, it's mono-friendly.)

The May draft of &quot;Thinking in C#&quot; was downloaded more than 100,000 times and this &quot;release candidate&quot; version reflects the many eyes from around the world that took a look at that version and used its integrated &quot;Backtalk&quot; system for giving us feedback. The &quot;release candidate&quot; is 99+% identical to the 1,000-page book that will be available in bookstores in  January for $49.95. The eBook is priced at $5 (via PayPal) until November 24, when the price will be raised to $10. Sometime in December I will make a determination as to whether an eBook edition makes economic sense, but a digital version will never be priced less than this introductory offer. (I am primarily interested in discovering two things with this experiment: discovering whether people feel an eBook is worth paying for and if publishing an eBook is a hassle.)

More details and the table of contents are available at the provided link.

Cheers,
Larry O'Brien
