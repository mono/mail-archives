<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> I'm presuming DllImport and P/Invoke aren't the preferred methods here? 
</I>&gt;<i> I looked at System.Net.Socket, since that would appear to be a task
</I>&gt;<i> similar to implementing POSIX APIs.  It uses InternalCall, which I'm
</I>&gt;<i> presuming (C# In A Nutshell is not so clear on this) is implemented
</I>&gt;<i> within the interpreter.  I poked through mono and found the file
</I>&gt;<i> mono/io-layer/sockets.c which appears to be the internal implementation
</I>&gt;<i> of the Sockets API.  Would the POSIX implementation look similar to
</I>&gt;<i> this?  Is there someplace all this is documented or am I on my own?
</I>
Ok, here is where it gets tricky.  The official response is `Only use
P/Invoke', but sometimes it might be convenient (for speed reasons) to
use internal calls.  The tricky bit is: internal calls are only
available on the runtime.

Now, I figured that there is a *hack* we can use, but it is a hack, in
which you P/Invoke into a bootstrap routine (called from a static
constructor), and the bootstrap routine in turn registers the
InternalCalls with the runtime, and then the rest of the code uses
internalcalls.

My suggestion is: for now stick to using P/Invoke, and we will later
implement the performance hack.

Now, another of the tricky bits is this: enumerations and constants are
different across the various Unix implementations, so it is not possible
to P/Invoke a library with constants that are defined in C# directly,
because they will likely change (in fact, the values change across Linux
ports: the same system constant value is different across ports).

So the process to assemble this is multi-process:

	* A C# file containing all the enumeration values.

	* A C# program that can read these enumeration values and
	  generate &quot;support&quot; header file for C consumption.

	* A C program that includes the header file, and maps constants
	  to their native valuess.

	* A C# set of definitions to P/Invoke into it.

Let me give you an illustration:

PosixEnums.cs:
[IncludeFile (&quot;fcntl.h&quot;)]
[IncludeFile (&quot;sys/stat.h&quot;)]
	enum OpenMode {
		O_CREAT,
		O_EXCL,
		O_APPEND
	}

The a C# program uses reflection to generate the following header file:

#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
#define OpenMode_O_CREAT	O_CREAT
#define OpenMode_O_EXCL         O_EXCL
#define OpenMode_O_APPEND       O_APPEND

And the following C helper file:

#include &quot;PosixEnums.h&quot;
map_OpenMode (int flags)
{
	switch (flags){
		case OpenMode_O_CREAT: return O_CREAT;
		case OpenMode_O_EXCEL: return O_EXCL;
		case OpenMode_O_APPEND: return O_APPEND;
	}
}

Notice that the source file contains the attribute &quot;IncludeFile&quot; (that
you will have to create, and &quot;pull&quot; it out yourself to generate the
corresponding header files).

Then you have to write the C code, *manually*:

int posix_open (string filename, int flags)
{
	return open (filename, 	map_OpenMode (flags));
}

Then from C# you write (again manually) the P/Invoke invocation:

[DllImport (&quot;Mono.Posix.so&quot;, EntryPoint=&quot;posix_open&quot;)]
int open (string filename, OpenMode mode);

Once you have the code, we can integrate it into the build.

Hope this helps,
Miguel.
