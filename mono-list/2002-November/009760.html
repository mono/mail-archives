<PRE>For a unix-type daemon, the simplest thing to do for such a program is
to simply make a normal program and run it in the background (by
starting it with &quot;mono program.exe &amp;&quot; or &quot;nohup mono program.exe &amp;&quot;
depending on what you want.

There is nothing magical about a daemon except that it normally forks
and setsid's itself (which you don't really have to worry about if you
start it as written above).  If you want to make it into a &quot;real&quot;
unix-daemon then learn how to pinvoke fork and setsid or write a library
for it.

The really cool thing would be if you or someone else implemented the
service-stuff from windows for mono and then you could use that.
