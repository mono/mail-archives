</I>

I think I need to understand better what clients are available, and why 
there may be two (or more) written for .NET in C# and under GPL.

There is Mono.Data.MySQL. Coded in C# and currently 'heavily' under 
development, written by Daniel Morgan, Rodrigo Moya, Ravi Pratap and 
Brad Merrill.  Under GPL.

Is this the one which uses the libmySQL.dll and linmysqlclient.so?

Or is this the one which is pure C#, but may suffer in the future as it 
may fall behind the MySQL protocol?

Is this the official 'mono' MySQL API you refered to?


There is also <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysqlnet/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysqlnet/</A> which is also 
GPL.  Also C#.  Written by Jun Su, Reggie Burnett and Adam Hunger. This 
currently shows no files, so i can't look at it.  This currently has 
problems with Mono, but you have a working version.

There is another .NET MySQL driver written in C# by Manuel Lucas Viñas 
Livschitz, also GPL.  Is this the same one, I can't seem to find the 
page where I downloaded this.

There is the one from <A HREF="http://www.einfodesigns.com/.">http://www.einfodesigns.com/.</A>  Not GPL.

This is the ONLY official .NET API from MySQL on 
<A HREF="http://www.mysql.com/portal/software/html/software-32-1.html.">http://www.mysql.com/portal/software/html/software-32-1.html.</A>  Which 
seems odd as MySQL seem to encourage the stong use of GPL API's.


If you can enlighten me a little, I would be greatful.

&gt;<i> The MySQL provider in Mono right now uses a native client shared 
</I>&gt;<i> library: on
</I>&gt;<i> Windows, this shared library is libmySQL.dll and on Linux, it is
</I>&gt;<i> libmysqlclient.so
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A MySQL provider written in 100% C# would be better for performance 
</I>&gt;<i> reasons,
</I>&gt;<i> but that would mean we would have to keep up with the client/server 
</I>&gt;<i> protocol
</I>&gt;<i> used for MySQL database access.  At least with MySQL's native client
</I>&gt;<i> library, the API is stable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is a GPL'ed MySQL provider in sourceforge.net and works on .NET, but
</I>&gt;<i> it does not work on Mono due to problems in I/O or networking (I assume)
</I>&gt;<i> right now.  I have a modified version on my hard drive if interested. 
</I>&gt;<i>  I had
</I>&gt;<i> to strip out the Windows.Forms and System.Drawing stuff in there since we
</I>&gt;<i> don't need that for Mono.  This provider is written in 100% C# and 
</I>&gt;<i> does not
</I>&gt;<i> use any MySQL client library because it communicates directly with the 
</I>&gt;<i> MySQL
</I>&gt;<i> server.  This is the
</I>&gt;<i> MySQLNet mentioned in Venu's article.  Here is the link to that GPL'ed
</I>&gt;<i> driver
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysqlnet/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysqlnet/</A>
