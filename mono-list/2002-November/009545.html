<PRE>Hello!

&gt;<i> How far is GTK# ? I plan to abstract large GUI parts of SharpDevelop to be
</I>&gt;<i> API independent
</I>&gt;<i> to allow easier porting between the GUI APIs. My current plan is to move
</I>&gt;<i> SharpDevleop to an
</I>&gt;<i> abstract layer which can be ported to GTK# as well as Windows.Forms or any
</I>&gt;<i> other GUI API.
</I>
Gtk# is maturing rapidly, but it is still a rough toolkit.  I am glad
that it works now on Win32 (because Gtk works on Win32), but there are
still some rough edges, some corners that need to be polished and
improved before its a mainstream toolkit.

Also, we need to get the documentation work for it off the ground, it
would be unfair to ask for a port of SharpDevelop without docs.

That being said, someone with Gtk/Gtk# experience should probably look
at SharpDevelop and try to assess the size of the changes, or the pieces
that could be factored out for the UI elements. 

&gt;<i> I only need to rewrite some components like the text editor, but I don't
</I>&gt;<i> expect that this will be too
</I>&gt;<i> difficult. I don't think that it is good to have SharpDevelop run under
</I>&gt;<i> winelib because I want to have
</I>&gt;<i> 'native' look and feel under linux.
</I>
Well, since I figured this would be a common problem with Winforms
applications, I was thinking that we could modify Wine to load/use the
Gtk rendering engines and use those to render its widgets.  Since Gtk is
converging to Windows key-bindings and feel anyways, they would be a
nice match.

Miguel
