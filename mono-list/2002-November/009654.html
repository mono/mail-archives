It's a .dll that can be deployed on MS framework ....(as well as on
Mono or DotGNU for that  matter).

AFAIK .... that wouldn't work if you use Gnome widgets ... Is gnomeui
ported to windows (IIRC only Gtk was ported) ... And I don't see any
GNOMESOURCE being used for gtkshar-glue either ...

This obviously means that Gtk# is hobbled in windows as Gtk# includes a
lot more than basic Gtk ... Basic Gtk should work the same ... But it's
a kludge to be restricted from using the Gnome* widgets (Dialogs, 
Entryboxen... all that kind of stuff..) . I program using Glade+Python 
right now ... So my critical question is &quot;When Will glade work on Win32&quot;.

Yeah but you *can* write apps that are portable in GUI ... (or abstract
out and select load .dlls) ...
