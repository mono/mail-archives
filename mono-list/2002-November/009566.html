<PRE>Hi Everyone,

I have been lurking on this list for a few days now after looking at
go-mono.com.  Just thought I would introduce myself.  My name is Joe
Mozelesky, I am a currently unemployed techie from the business software
industry.

I have an idea for something that I think would both a) garner a lot of
attention and b) really fill in a gap in getting Linux on the business
desktop (oh, and c) offer a Linux counterpoint to one of Microsoft's new
business strategies).  I am working on a lot of documentation, marketing
type stuff (the horror! :-)) and will hopefully open a project on
Sourceforge and launch a website soon.  I don't want to let the cat out
of the bag too soon because I want there to be a clear roadmap.  

I don't want to 'spam' your list with lots of questions for which this
list is not intended.  I have some questions related to building a suite
of applications on top of the Mono implementation of .NET, which would
hopefully be cross-platform and run on Windows as well.  These are not
&quot;how do I make xyz with C#&quot; questions but more high level business and
development strategy questions, questions about figuring out a licensing
scheme that allows the software to be fully open-source but still offers
some way for me to earn a living :-) (either getting the project rolled
in to something at a company who will then employ me, or allowing me to
derive other revenue somehow), and questions about what I need to be
careful about if I start development soon using the .NET SDK on Win2k,
and then wish to switchover to Mono once things are 100% ready (like
Windows.Forms, etc.).

I could also see this being something that a company like Ximian or
RedHat would be very interested in.

So if someone gives me the go-ahead, and this is the proper forum, I
will summarize everything in a post, otherwise if you can point me to a
better place to discuss my ideas and questions that would be most
appreciated.  There are so many other lists out there that I don't know
where to begin, if someone could tell me what the say top 2 or 3 general
ones are, I would really appreciate it.

Thanks,

Joe Mozelesky

P.S. I don't know who it is that maintains the Ximian.org website but it
is really sharp!  I like it...a lot!
