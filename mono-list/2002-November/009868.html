<PRE>I was at a Borland and .Net roadmap type seminar this morning and they 
mentioned mono as the implementation of the CLR to target for linux. 
They also introduced it as &quot;a commercial implementation that you will 
have to pay for&quot; which they then compared to dotGNU as the 
implementation &quot;witten by people in their basements that would 
cancerously make all your .net apps gpl&quot;. This was targeted at a windows 
developer audiance but I would have expected better from borland.

Anyway the mono FAQ says:

Question 17: Will Ximian offer Mono commercially?
When Mono is ready to be shipped Ximian will offer a commercial support 
and services for Mono.

I assume this is still the case or are there plans to licence mono to 
companies like Borland ?
