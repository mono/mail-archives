<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> I am currently running Windows 2000 on 50 PC's.  I am developing new
</I>&gt;<i> software for my company in VB.NET and winforms.  I will store my data
</I>&gt;<i> in a MS-SQL server database.  As I understand it, I should be able to
</I>&gt;<i> use your software on a Linux box to run my VB.NET software.  As I see
</I>&gt;<i> it, this would save me from having to purchase 50 copies of the next
</I>&gt;<i> operating system @ $200 each.  I should be able to run my software on
</I>&gt;<i> a Linux box.  That would be a big money saver for me.  Any guess as to
</I>&gt;<i> when your software will be ready for me to use?  It said in the FAQ
</I>&gt;<i> that this would be available commercially, any idea how much (budget
</I>&gt;<i> purposes only)?  How many zeros are we talking.  Anything else I
</I>&gt;<i> should know?  My software will not be finished for at least a year and
</I>&gt;<i> maybe two.  So I am not in a huge hurry.
</I>
VB.NET support does not exist today, but I see that you are not in a
hurry to get it, so your time frame seems to match ours.

Mono is available as open source software, so the licensing cost of Mono
is effectively zero.

Miguel.
