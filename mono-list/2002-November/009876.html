<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> I'm another ASP.NET developer with loads of Linux experience and
</I>&gt;<i> absolutely no fear of getting my hands dirty to make work whatever you
</I>&gt;<i> currently have available.  Can you give me a starting point?  I've
</I>&gt;<i> already installed the &quot;Mono for Debian&quot; package from debianplanet.org on
</I>&gt;<i> my Sid system and have been building C# libraries and executable
</I>&gt;<i> assemblies...  I have no idea how to start the ASP.NET-capable web
</I>&gt;<i> server, though.
</I>
This is a good first step.  Now, you need to compile your own Mono from
CVS, because the System.Web code has changed tremendously since the
official release.

Once you get your CVS version of Mono running, get the `xsp' module,
which contains a test server for ASP.NET, and start throwing .aspx
programs at it (I suggest we test all of the demos from the asp.net
quickstart tutorials first, and then move on to more complex
applications).

As you test, you will run into various bugs that will require
investigative work, debugging works, and implementation work. 

&gt;<i> I'm all over it, just tell me how to get started.  I'll switch to the
</I>&gt;<i> CVS code if that's preferred.  I'm currently building custom ASP.NET web
</I>&gt;<i> controls for a living, so I have plenty of stuff to port over and try on
</I>&gt;<i> Mono.
</I>
You have the exact match of talent needed to help in this area!

&gt;<i> Outside of the class libraries, is there a standard format for Mono
</I>&gt;<i> documentation?  I can produce whatever format you need including Monodoc
</I>&gt;<i> XML if that's appropriate.  I'd love to write some HOWTO stuff for
</I>&gt;<i> getting started with custom control development under Mono and perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> other ASP.NET topics.
</I>
A howto would be awesome, but the interesting thing about asp.net is
that most knowledge can be transfered from Microsoft .NET to Mono
without changes.

As for documentation: Duncan has been working on the gtk# front-end to
author documentation for us, but I have always wanted to have also an
asp.net authoring tool.   This could be also a test case for it ;-)

Miguel
