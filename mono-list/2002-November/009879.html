<PRE>Nick and I were recently removed from the mono-hackers list because we've been 
helping/participating in the DotGNU/Portable.NET project.  This was done 
because Miguel has confidential information about Mono that he does not want 
disclosed to the competition.  I was under the impression that mono-hackers 
was created for technical discussions of the development of the Mono runtime, 
compilers and libraries, however Miguel stated that it is also intended as a 
place to discuss strategy and to announce Ximian partnerships/contracts with 
various groups.  This is unfortunate in that it limits the amount of 
community participation in technical discussions.

I would suggest the creation of a new list, perhaps hosted by sourceforge or 
another similar group affiliated with the community.  This list would be open 
to all developers and important discussions relating to the technical details 
and plans for the runtime, classlibs, and compiler could be discussed there.  
Ximian could use mono-hackers (or it's predecessor: ximian-mono-list) to 
relate confidential information and technical discussions could still go on 
with the full participation of the community.

Cheers,

Adam
