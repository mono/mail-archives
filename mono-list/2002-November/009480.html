Hi Marc! 


    I've been looking over the Mono site at:
    <A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/index.html">http://www.go-mono.com/index.html</A> and am curious, has anyone 
    in the project been working with our Eclipse frameworks or
    development environments? 


I've been using Eclipse and Improve's c# plug-in, and so far it has been
a very positive experience. I was just coordinating with other MONO
users that want to contribute, to start making a tutorial on Eclipse for
Mono among other things.


    A company in France called Improve Technologies at:
    <A HREF="http://www.improve-technologies.com/alpha/esharp/">http://www.improve-technologies.com/alpha/esharp/</A> has actually done
    a commercial plug-in for developing C# applications on the Eclipse
    Platform. 
    

It seems the plug-in isn't commercial (All Content made available in
this plugin is provided to you under the terms and conditions of the
Common Public License Version 0.5. Improve S.A. ).


    Eclipse was designed for multi-language, multi-platform tools
    deployment. It's completely neutral about the objects being
    developed. This means that many projects that are working on C/C++,
    Cobol, SmallTalk, Java and other legacy languages on a wide variety
    of deployment platforms may want to integrate .NET related
    technology into their projects. 
    A set of MONO plug-ins for Eclipse would make it easier for those
    projects to integrate your tooling and environment. 
    

It would indeed be very good to improve the plug-in to add some more
features that the JDT has. I am now investing my time in other areas,
but I hope that my introduction to Eclipse for Mono will get some
attention to attract developers. It is a very interesting project to
contribute...only if I could devote more time...


    Eclipse itself is written in the Java language, with a high
    efficiency UI construction layer called SWT that adopts the look and
    feel of the platform it runs on. All of this is in open source under
    the Common Public License. It runs on Linux on a variety of VMs. One
    of these VMs, called JIKES, is in open source. See:
    <A HREF="http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/oss/jikes/">http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/oss/jikes/</A> and
    <A HREF="http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/oss/jikesrvm/?origin=jikes">http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/oss/jikesrvm/?origin=jikes</A> for
    more details. 
    

It is amazing how great SWT mimics as a native Gnome2 application. The
only two negative things (although not very important ones) I've
encountered so far is: 

        *  slow widget drawing speed (I took antialiasing away to get a
          more pleasantly experience)
        * sometimes it doesn't use Gtk's theme colors in some widgets.

On the positive side it is:

        * VERY stable
        * the CVS utilities are plain AMAZING (you can apply/create
          patches, synchronize with repository, compare, commit and so
          many more things).
        * the emacs' key bindings and automatic indentation works
          perfect.

    
    Let me know if I can help put you in touch with members of our
    project team. 
    
    Marc 
    


I will be starting the tutorial real soon now, so I will need some
revision from more experienced people to correct my mistakes, since I am
rather new to Eclipse. Please inform me of any mailing list I can
announce the availability of the tutorial.

Thank you very much for contacting us.
Pablo
